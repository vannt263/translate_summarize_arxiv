    "methanol masers are often found in star - forming regions .",
    "there are two sets of transitions seen to produce methanol masers .",
    "class  i methanol masers ( most importantly the 36 and 44  ghz transitions ) are believed to be collisionally excited , while class  ii masers ( including the 6.7 and 12  ghz transitions ) are radiatively excited @xcite .",
    "class  i and class  ii methanol masers are sometimes both found in association with the same source ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but the two classes of masers are very rarely seen at the same velocity or in close ( subarcsecond ) spatial overlap .",
    "class  i methanol masers , in which shocks dominate over infrared radiation , have often been assumed to be tracing an earlier evolutionary state of star formation than class  ii methanol , water , or oh masers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "subcategorization of class  i masers by physical conditions may be possible @xcite , leading some authors to speculate that line intensity ratios among the class  i masers may be a proxy for evolutionary stage @xcite .",
    "however , class  i maser studies have traditionally been biased towards regions hosting other tracers of star formation , and the cluster environments in which class  i masers are found are usually quite complex , calling into question traditional models of the evolutionary timeline of class  i masers ( section 4.4 of * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , class  i masers have typically been observed with single - dish telescopes , which can identify whether or not a particular class  i transition produces masers in a region ( and how bright they are ) but do not have the resolution to determine their location relative to masers in other transitions .",
    "given the complex environments associated with clustered star formation , high angular resolution is required to identify the relations between masers and excitation sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and between multiple transitions of methanol @xcite .",
    "higher angular resolution is also necessary to understand the physical conditions that produce masers in each of the class  i transitions , which may not be identical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these concerns motivated @xcite to do an unbiased single - dish search for class  i methanol masers in nearby molecular clouds , resulting in the detection of new class  i maser features . several sites within these clouds",
    "host previously known 44  ghz methanol masers , many of which have been mapped interferometrically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "imaging the 36  ghz masers , the other bright transition seen in numerous sources @xcite , has heretofore not been possible due to the lack of interferometers operating at this frequency .",
    "however , recent upgrades to the australia telescope compact array and the expanded very large array ( evla ) are allowing the first arcsecond - resolution images of 36  ghz masers to be produced @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we report on the first evla maps of the 36  ghz masers in the dr21 star - forming complex .",
    "the evla was used to observe the 36.169  ghz @xmath0 line of methanol in dr21(oh ) , dr21w , and dr21n on 2010 may 26 . the array consisted of the 20 telescopes outfitted with ka - band receivers .",
    "the evla was in its most compact ( d ) configuration , providing a synthesized beamwidth of approximately @xmath1 .",
    "all three sources were observed in dual circular polarization centered on a fixed sky frequency of 36.1731  ghz and correlated with the new widar correlator .",
    "the 4  mhz observing bandwidth was divided into 256 spectral channels , giving a velocity coverage of 33  kms@xmath2 with a channel spacing of 0.13  kms@xmath2 .",
    "conversion from sky frequency to lsr velocity was performed with the assistance of the evla online dopset tool .",
    "total on - source observing time was @xmath3  min per source .",
    "typical single - channel noise levels were @xmath4  mjybeam@xmath2 near the center of the field    data reduction was carried out using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the flux scale was set using 3c48 .",
    "complex gain calibration was done using j2048 + 4310 .",
    "evla transition issues precluded accurate bandpass calibration , although it could be determined from calibrator data that baseline phases were flat across the entire observing band and amplitudes were flat across about 75% of the observing band .",
    "thus , our main results , including estimates of the positions of the detected masers , should not be significantly affected , although bandpass effects may lead to amplitude errors of a few percent over most of the observed velocity range .",
    "data were imaged , and flux densities were corrected for primary beam attenuation .",
    "minor velocity errors may be introduced by two effects .",
    "first , the uncertainty in the rest frequency of the observed line ( @xmath5  mhz ; * ? ? ? * ) is equivalent to a velocity uncertainty of 0.25  kms@xmath2 ( 2 channels ) .",
    "second , observations were performed at a fixed sky frequency , since doppler tracking was unavailable . the sky frequency associated with",
    "the rest frequency drifted by about 0.015  mhz over the course of the observations , possibly resulting in an insignificant spectral broadening of maser features . since the net uncertainty in determining the central velocity due to fixed - frequency observing ( @xmath6 a few @xmath7  kms@xmath2 ) is only a fraction of the channel separation ( and much smaller than a typical maser linewidth ) , the data were not corrected with cvel .",
    "we present 229.758  ghz @xmath8 maser and 226  ghz continuum sma data for all of our sources ( p.  pratap et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the angular resolution of these observations is @xmath9 .",
    "the bandwidth of the 229  ghz observations covered the velocity range from @xmath10 to @xmath11  kms@xmath2 with a spectral resolution of 0.13  kms@xmath2 .",
    "the flux densities of the 229  ghz masers were corrected for primary beam attenuation .",
    "the rms noise near field center was approximately 0.15  jybeam@xmath2 for dr21(oh ) and dr21n and 0.3  jybeam@xmath2 for dr21w .",
    "when possible , we compare our data against three other class  i methanol maser transitions from the literature : 44  ghz ( @xmath12 ) , 84  ghz ( @xmath13 ) , and 95  ghz ( @xmath14 ) . for dr21n , we also used archival 44  ghz data taken with the vla in b - configuration on 2006 jun 16 .",
    "parameters of detected masers are listed in table  [ table - masers ] .",
    "we detect 49 36  ghz maser features in the three observed dr21 sources : 21 in dr21n , 23 in dr21(oh ) , and 5 in dr21w .",
    "figures  [ fig - map - oh ] and [ fig - maps - n - w ] show the locations of the 36  ghz masers relative to other class  i methanol transitions mapped with interferometric resolution .",
    "the lsr velocities of detected masers are consistent with previous single - dish observations @xcite .",
    "spectra of the integrated flux of individual 36  ghz maser features are often not well fit by a single gaussian . in some cases multiple spectral peaks",
    "are evident , while in others there is evident skewness in the spectral peak .",
    "both of these cases imply the existence of structure on scales smaller than our synthesized beam size ( 12 ) .",
    "similar effects are seen in the 44  ghz transition , in which @xcite detect 17 masers in dr21(oh ) ( several with multiple spectral peaks ) using 10 minutes of vla d - configuration data , while @xcite detect 49 masers using a much longer integration of c - configuration data . when individual maser spectra in our data do show a single clear peak , we find that typical linewidths are on the order of 0.15 to 0.35  kms@xmath2 .",
    "there is also a signature of very weak , extended methanol emission in some sources , but the lack of proper bandpass calibration tempers our confidence in this result .",
    "there are 14 arcsecond - scale overlaps of a 36  ghz and a 229  ghz maser at approximately the same velocity ( @xmath15  kms@xmath2 ) . of these 14 associations , the 36  ghz maser is brighter in 7 , and the 229  ghz maser is brighter in the other 7 , indicating that either of the two @xmath16 lines may be brighter ( with the caveat that the 36 and 229  ghz observations did not occur simultaneously and that maser variability is possible ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon is seen in the @xmath17 series , where @xcite find that while the integrated 95  ghz flux is in general higher than that at 44  ghz , the integrated fluxes of sources whose spectra consist of _ narrow - velocity _ 44 and 95  ghz features ( where the two transitions presumably produce single masers in close spatial association ) are comparable in the two transitions .",
    "further high - resolution data will be necessary to examine the relation between the flux densities of different maser transitions seen in close spatial association with each other .",

    "* ) , respectively ) precludes more detailed analysis of multitransition positional coincidences .",
    "many of the 229  ghz masers align with 36  ghz masers on the western side of the outflow , but they appear to be more coincident with the 44  ghz masers of @xcite , especially in the eastern part of the outflow .",

    "each detected 36  ghz maser is found in close spatial association with a 44  ghz maser at approximately the same velocity .",

    "36  ghz masers are seen only at the eastern edge , while other transitions are seen throughout . in the central and western portions of the outflow , many of the 44  ghz masers , especially those that are highly redshifted or blueshifted compared to the velocity of the largest portion of the masers in the western outflow , have no accompanying 36  ghz features .",
    "class  ii masers in the 6.7  ghz transition ( @xmath21 ) only appear projected atop the bright continuum feature near the origin in figure  [ fig - map - oh ] @xcite .",
    "several 229  ghz class  i masers also appear , coincident with the 6.7  ghz masers in some cases at the @xmath22 level ( one - tenth of the 229  ghz beam size ) but offset slightly to the east and south .",
    "we also detect weak 36  ghz maser emission in the region , with spots ranging from 100 to 150  mjy detected in eight spectral channels between @xmath23 and @xmath24  kms@xmath2 , likely due to spectral blending of maser features that are not fully resolved at our resolution .",
    "we report the position of the strongest feature in table  [ table - masers ] .",
    "this feature is offset even farther to the east and south than the 229  ghz masers , with the caveat that it is difficult to determine the position of the 36  ghz maser accurately given the weakness of the maser and the 2  beamsize of the 36  ghz observations .",
    "several class  i masers appear to the south ( 36 and 44  ghz ) and north ( 44  ghz only ) of the outflow .",
    "unlike in the outflow , the 36  ghz masers in the south are usually not accompanied by cospatial 44  ghz masers . the northern and southern masers",
    "are generally redshifted and blueshifted , respectively , compared to the bulk of the masers in the outflow , although not all masers conform to this pattern .",
    "the southern masers are located closer to the sources dr21(oh)w , dr21(oh)s , and the ridge of ammonia emission connecting them ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) than to the outflow in dr21(oh ) , and therefore are unlikely to be associated with the main source driving the outflow in dr21(oh ) .      despite the detection of only 5 maser features , dr21w contains the brightest ( @xmath25  jy ) 36  ghz maser in our sample .",
    "this maser is the only one for which we detect an antisymmetric stokes v profile ( figure  [ fig - zeeman ] ) , which will be discussed further in section  [ magnetic ] .",
    "the bright masers near the origin in figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] are coincident with the 44  ghz masers detected by @xcite to better than a synthesized beamwidth .",
    "the velocities of the 36  ghz masers near the origin agree with the velocities of the brightest nearby 44  ghz masers to within 0.2  kms@xmath2 or better .",
    "dr21n was first identified as a 36  ghz maser source by @xcite .",
    "we detect numerous 36  ghz masers in this source , mostly in the range from @xmath26 to @xmath27  kms@xmath2 , on the eastern side of the distribution of maser emission ( figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] ) .",
    "several redshifted masers in the range @xmath28 to @xmath29  kms@xmath2 are found on the western side , along with one highly blueshifted maser ( @xmath30  kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "all detected 229  ghz masers are found in close proximity to ( @xmath31 from ) a 36  ghz maser .",
    "in contrast , no 44  ghz maser is seen within 1  of a 36  ghz maser .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - zeeman ] , we detect an antisymmetric `` s - curve '' stokes v signature in the spectrum of the brightest maser in dr21w .",
    "if interpreted as due to zeeman splitting , the implied line - of - sight magnetic field strength is @xmath32  mg , where @xmath33 represents the zeeman splitting coefficient ( assumed to be 1.7 hzmg@xmath2 for the 36  ghz transition by * ? ? ?",
    "the direction of this component of the magnetic field would be oriented away from the observer .",
    "the full three - dimensional field strength would presumably be larger , as zeeman splitting measures only the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field when the splitting between zeeman components is much less than the line width @xcite .",
    "stokes v s - curves were not detected in any of the other maser sources , with a @xmath34 upper limit of @xmath35  mg in the brightest remaining maser in dr21(oh ) , although we note that a circular polarization fraction of @xmath36 ( i.e. , the v / i seen in dr21w ) would not produce a detectable ( @xmath37 ) stokes v signal in dr21(oh ) or in any of the weaker masers .    however , there is significant uncertainty in the zeeman splitting coefficient , which calls into question the direct zeeman interpretation of methanol stokes v s - curves . @xcite obtained a laboratory estimate of the land @xmath38-factor for the 25  ghz @xmath39 series of transitions of methanol , but the obtained value is an average over several different transitions and , in any case , may not be appropriate for the 36  ghz transition of methanol . @xcite and @xcite used the @xcite @xmath38-factor to estimate the zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7  ghz transition , and @xcite followed their method in deriving the zeeman splitting coefficient at 36  ghz .",
    "a more recent look suggests that these calculations may have overestimated the zeeman splitting coefficients by an order of magnitude ( w.  h.  t.  vlemmings 2010 , private communication ) , which would serve to _ increase _ proportionally the putative magnetic field strengths reported from methanol zeeman splitting in this work and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    even if the @xcite zeeman splitting coefficient for the 36  ghz transition is ( approximately ) correct , a line - of - sight magnetic field strength of 58  mg is uncomfortably high .",
    "measurements of the magnetic field strength are often used as a proxy for density . using a scaling of @xmath40 from the densities and magnetic fields of dr21",
    "would give a number density around @xmath41  @xmath42 @xcite , a value several orders of magnitude higher than that though to be suitable for 36  ghz maser excitation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "scaling from values typically found in oh masers instead ( a few milligauss , @xmath43  @xmath42 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results in density estimates well in excess of @xmath44  @xmath42 , which is still substantially larger than theoretical estimates ( but see also section 4.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the discrepancy between the implied density and theoretical calculations appropriate for class  i maser activity grows by two orders of magnitude if a smaller zeeman splitting factor is assumed ( w.  h.  t.  vlemmings 2010 , private communication ) .",
    "if the zeeman interpretation is correct , one possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the correlation between magnetic field strength and density does not hold in ( all ) the environments of class  i methanol masers , implying that the magnetic energy density is much greater than the kinetic energy density @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the high density implied by the large magnetic field is correct , and the bright 36  ghz maser in dr21w is produced via a pumping scheme not normally assumed for class  i masers .",
    "typically , class  i masers are thought to be produced by collisional excitation followed by spontaneous cascade down to lower energy levels , with sink photons escaping or being absorbed by cold dust .",
    "this mechanism has an upper limit for density , above which the inverted transition is thermalized by collisions .",
    "one possible pumping mechanism at higher densities involves collisional excitation by a warm species and a collisional sink by a cooler species to produce the population inversion @xcite .",
    "this mechanism requires a two - temperature mixture of particles , such as electrons ( and/or ions ) and neutrals , that may exist after the passage of a shock front . in principle",
    ", such a collisional - collisional pump can operate at arbitrarily high density , as long as the temperature difference between the two species is sustained .    however , it is more probable that the stokes v signature we detect does not measure the magnetic field directly .",
    "@xcite proposed a mechanism by which changes in the magnetic field orientation can convert linear polarization to circular polarization along the amplification path in a maser .",
    "the stokes v signature produced by this mechanism can produce an s - curve that can mimic the effect of zeeman splitting of a much larger magnetic field . in the case of circumstellar sio masers that @xcite consider ,",
    "their proposed mechanism could operate with a magnetic field as weak as 0.1% of the magnetic field strength implied from interpreting the s - curve as purely due to zeeman splitting .",
    "the @xcite mechanism requires that the zeeman splitting in units of frequency exceed both the stimulated emission rate and the decay rate appropriate for the masing transition , a condition likely to be satisfied for class  i methanol masers ( see section 4.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , dr21w ( this work ) and m8e @xcite , the two sources with detected zeeman splitting in the 36  ghz line , are also the two sources in which @xcite detected circular polarization in the 133  ghz ( @xmath45 ) transition .",
    "future high - sensitivity observations at 133  ghz might permit detection of an s - curve signature in stokes v , thereby testing whether the magnetic field implied from a pure zeeman interpretation is consistent with the values derived at 36  ghz .",
    "( since the 36  ghz and 133  ghz methanol lines are both @xmath16 transitions , the same land @xmath38-factor would be applicable to each of them . )",
    "careful laboratory measurements of the zeeman splitting coefficients appropriate for the brightest methanol maser transitions would also be very helpful .",
    "excitation models indicate that the physical conditions that are thought to produce inversion in class  i transitions usually lead to anti - inversion in class  ii transitions and vice versa @xcite . in that regard , the existence of class  i 36 and 229  ghz masers at the same velocity and location as the class  ii 6.7  ghz maser site is surprising .",
    "these masers are also coincident with the brightest continuum emission near the outflow , which may be an important clue to their origin .",
    "there is precedent for overlaps between class  i and class  ii methanol masers . @xcite",
    "deduce spatial coincidences between the 6.7  ghz class  ii and 25  ghz @xmath46 series of class  i methanol masers in omc-1 , although the angular resolution of their interferometric observations is much poorer than either the 229  ghz data on which we report or the @xcite 6.7  ghz data .",
    "@xcite model the 6.7/25  ghz overlap as arising from a lower - temperature regime than is typically assumed for class  ii masers .",
    "this pumping model requires an intermixed environment of gas and dust at a lower temperature ( @xmath47  k ) than for traditional class  ii maser formation . the strong 226  ghz continuum emission in dr21(oh )",
    "likely marks such an environment that is rich in dust .",
    "the @xcite model did not investigate excitation at 229  ghz , but it does predict inversion at 36  ghz , which is also a @xmath48 transition .",
    "the model predicts that 44 and 95  ghz masers should _ not _ appear at a low - temperature 6.7  ghz maser site , since the former are @xmath17 transitions , while the latter is a @xmath49 transition .",
    "indeed , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite do not report 44  ghz masers at this location .      in each of the sources we observed , the 36  ghz masers divide into two sets : those that are found to be cospatial with other class  i maser transitions , and those that are spatially isolated .",
    "we address each of these two groups in turn .    in the outflow of dr21(oh ) and in the cluster in the north of dr21w",
    ", we note that the distribution of the 36  ghz masers is similar to that of the 44 , 84 , 95 , and 229  ghz masers .",
    "additionally , the brightest masers in all of these transitions appear in the same location . in dr21(oh ) , the brightest masers in all class  i transitions occur in a narrow velocity range ( @xmath50 to @xmath51  kms@xmath2 ) at the western tip of the outflow .",
    "the next - brightest masers in each transition appear approximately 10  east of this position ( i.e. , 10  west of the origin in figure  [ fig - map - oh ] ) .",
    "it is clear that these masers exist in a physical regime in which strong maser emission is produced in a large number of @xmath52 and @xmath17 transitions simultaneously .",
    "the existence of a nearby energetic source creating an outflow likely shocks the surrounding molecular material , pumping multiple transitions of methanol in the same location .",
    "on the other hand , all sources contain regions in which 36  ghz masers are not found to be coincident with other transitions .",
    "for instance , numerous masers in both the 36 and 44  ghz masers are found to the south of the outflow in dr21(oh ) .",
    "for the most part , the two transitions are not seen to be spatially coincident .",
    "most of the 36  ghz masers and some of the 44  ghz masers in the south are seen near the periphery of cs emission @xcite .",
    "the common feature of the environment of these masers is the lack of a nearby energetic source . as in the sagittarius  a region , it is possible that these masers trace molecular density clumps that are shock - excited by core collision or compression @xcite .",
    "the 229  ghz masers appear to align more closely with the 44  ghz masers than with the 36  ghz masers in the dr21(oh ) outflow .",
    "while 229  ghz masers are found to be coincident with 36  ghz masers on the western side of the outflow , there is always an accompanying 44  ghz maser .",
    "in contrast , several 229  ghz masers appear coincident with 44  ghz masers but without 36  ghz emission , especially on the eastern side of the outflow .",
    "however , we note several caveats about drawing conclusions from these points .",
    "first , the angular resolution of the observations of both the 44  ghz and the 229  ghz masers is higher than that of the 36  ghz observations on which we report , and it is possible that more sensitive , higher - resolution observations of the 36  ghz masers will uncover other features at the sites of the 44/229  ghz overlaps .",
    "second , every detected 229  ghz maser in dr21n appears near a 36  ghz maser site ( figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] ) .",
    "third , at present the three dr21 sources on which we report are the only sources mapped in all three of the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz transitions , and the field of view encompassed by the 229  ghz observations in dr21(oh ) excludes nearly all of the masers south of the outflow as well as the eastern tip of the outflow itself .",
    "this constitutes a rather small set of sources from which to draw general conclusions about the properties of the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz masers relative to each other .",
    "more interferometric observations of both the 36 and 229  ghz transitions will be required to fully understand the phenomenology of either .",
    "we have interferometrically imaged three sources in the 36 and 229  ghz class  i methanol maser lines .",
    "we find numerous masers in both transitions and a diversity of conditions among them .",
    "notably , we identify the following three environments , each of which may correspond to a different set of excitation conditions .",
    "the outflow in dr21(oh ) contains a large number of overlaps in the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz transitions .",
    "strong emission is also seen at 84 and 95  ghz , although there is a lack of high - resolution observations of these lines .",
    "the brightest masers in all transitions appear at the same velocity and in the same location at the western tip of the outflow as traced by the masers .",
    "the bright continuum source in dr21(oh ) is associated with both the class  ii 6.7  ghz masers and class  i 36 and 229  ghz @xmath53-type masers , but the class  i 44  ghz @xmath54-type masers are conspicuously absent .",
    "this environment may be explained by the low - temperature intermixed dust and gas model of @xcite .",
    "the 229  ghz transition produces detectable masers at a subset of the 36  ghz maser sites in dr21n . in both this source and in dr21(oh ) well south of the outflow , the 36 and 44  ghz masers have a similar large - scale distribution but are rarely found to produce a maser at the same site .",
    "in addition , the brightest maser in dr21w produces an antisymmetric stokes v profile that implies a large magnetic field if interpreted as being due to zeeman splitting .",
    "there is a very large uncertainty in the zeeman splitting coefficient appropriate for the 36  ghz transition , but the implied density ( assuming @xmath55 ) greatly exceeds the range over which class  i masers are thought to form .",
    "it is possible that the circular polarization in this maser feature is produced by a much smaller magnetic field whose orientation changes over the amplification path of the maser @xcite . in any case ,",
    "careful laboratory measurement of zeeman splitting coefficients appropriate for methanol maser transitions is warranted given the increasing number of zeeman - like stokes v signatures identified in methanol transitions over the past few years .    in order to realize the goal of being able to identify the physical conditions in a variety of star - forming regions by the presence or absence of various methanol maser transitions",
    ", it will be necessary to understand a few sources in greater detail .",
    "our results highlight the need for both increased theoretical effort and more sensitive observations of multiple class  i transitions at higher angular resolution .",
    "in particular , higher - resolution maps of the 84 and 95  ghz transitions as well as higher - frequency maser lines may be both enlightening and timely in the advent of the alma era .",
    "a further survey of sources in the 36 and 229  ghz transitions , when combined with 44  ghz maps in the literature , may also be helpful in determining the range of possible methanol excitation conditions in nature .",
