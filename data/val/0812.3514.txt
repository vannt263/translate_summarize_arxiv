    "physical systems become very susceptible to external perturbations close to a phase transition . in several theoretical approaches the huge increase of the relaxation time of super - cooled liquid is traced back to the proximity to a phase transition  . therefore",
    ", it would be natural to expect that responses to external fields become singular also approaching the glass transition .",
    "however , standard _ linear",
    "_ responses ( as well as correlation functions ) are known to remain quite featureless . in this work ,",
    "following up  @xcite , we show using general arguments that instead _ non - linear _ responses do increase .",
    "furthermore , we work out detailed predictions within the mode coupling theory of glasses and we show what is the relation between the growth of non - linear responses and the one of previously introduced probes of dynamic correlations .    in order to grasp why only non - linear responses may grow approaching the glass transition , it is instructive to recall the situation of standard critical phenomena and contrast it to the one of spin glasses . in standard critical phenomena there is a spontaneous symmetry breaking toward an ordered phase .",
    "the main consequence of the broken symmetry is that there are different but thermodynamically equivalent states in which the system can be found : they are all related by the symmetry at hand .",
    "for example , below the ferromagnetic transition the state with a given magnetization @xmath2 and the one characterized by the magnetization @xmath3 are equivalent and the system will be in one or the other depending on boundary conditions , residual fields , etc . switching on an external field that couples to the order parameter allows one to select one given state , e.g.",
    "a positive magnetic field selects the state with positive magnetization in ferromagnetic systems . as a consequence , it is easy to understand that just before the transition , where the system is at the brink of developing long range order , the response to an external field is huge and actually becomes infinite at the critical point .",
    "the situation is more subtle for systems characterized by the appearance and growth of _ amorphous long range order _ , as it is the case in spin glasses and is conjectured to be the case for glasses  @xcite .",
    "the only diverging _ linear _ susceptibility would be the _ staggered _ one : the response obtained by using a small field with spatial modulation correlated to the one of the amorphous state .",
    "of course , this is not doable in experiments and not even in simulations since it is impossible to guess the external field which would impose a given _ amorphous _ long - range ordered state because it is amorphous as the state it pins ( an external field with an uncorrelated spatial modulation , e.g. an homogenous field , does not allow to select one state from the others and so it does not lead to singular responses ) . for spin glasses ,",
    "the square of the staggered linear response can nevertheless be probed , since it is related to the static third order non - linear susceptibility  @xcite , which was shown to diverge at the transition .",
    "similar arguments  @xcite ( see also below ) adapted to supercooled liquids - where the disorder is not quenched but self - induced - suggest that linear responses will be featureless but non - linear susceptibilities should instead increase approaching the glass transition .",
    "the main difference between spin glasses and structural glasses is that in the latter case one has to focus on _ dynamical _ non - linear responses .",
    "it was argued in  @xcite , on the basis of physical and heuristic arguments , that the non - linear dielectric susceptibility @xmath4 should exhibit a growing peak around @xmath5 , while @xmath6 should remain trivial , in contrast with the case of spin - glasses ( @xmath7 is the standard notation for the relaxation time of super - cooled liquids ) .",
    "however , the detailed shape of @xmath4 in the glassy region is beyond the grasp of those heuristic arguments .",
    "since the corresponding experiments are currently being performed  @xcite , it is quite important to get more precise predictions on the expected shape of @xmath4 .",
    "this is the primary aim of the present study , where we obtain for the first time , using general arguments made more precise in the context of the mode coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite of the glass transition , some precise information on the non - linear susceptibility , in particular concerning both its frequency and temperature dependence .",
    "our results can be generalized to other non - linear responses such as non - linear compressibility and non - linear rheological responses",
    ". these should be measurable for colloids approaching the glass transition .",
    "it is important to relate the results on non - linear responses to the ones obtained recently on dynamical correlations .",
    "this is the second aim of our work . for purpose of self - consistency",
    ", we recall below some definitions and results that we will use in the following sections .    it was established in the last decade that glass - forming liquids become more and more dynamically correlated approaching the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , related to an increasing heterogeneity in the dynamics , is remarkable since , for the first time , some type of spatial correlation has been clearly connected to the slowing down of the dynamics of supercooled liquids . in order to unveil the existence of dynamical correlations , one has to focus on some local probe of the relaxation dynamics - typically a two point function @xmath8 where @xmath9 could be the density fluctuation , @xmath10 , at position @xmath11 and time @xmath12 , or the mobility field  @xcite .",
    "a measure of dynamical spatial correlations is obtained by considering the four point correlator @xmath13  @xcite , where the brakets denotes the usual connected average over dynamical histories . by analogy with standard critical phenomena ,",
    "a susceptibility was called susceptibility in  @xcite .",
    "this terminology is still used although is a measure of the fluctuation of the dynamics and not a response function . ] may be naturally defined by spatially integrating @xmath14 : @xmath15 .",
    "this ` dynamical susceptibility ' , @xmath16 , has been intensively studied in the past few years , both theoretically and numerically  @xcite .",
    "one finds that @xmath16 reaches a peak value for time scales of the order of the relaxation time of the system @xmath7 , and the height of this peak increases as the temperature is reduced , as a clear sign of the growth of some dynamical correlation length as the glass transition is approached . from an experimental point of view , however , four - point correlation functions are very difficult to measure directly , except in cases where one can monitor the trajectory of individual particles - for example granular and colloidal systems where @xmath16 can be measured directly and again shows interesting features as the system jams  @xcite .",
    "another interesting quantity , extensively studied in the context of dynamic heterogeneity in the past few years , is the derivative of the standard two - body correlation @xmath17 ( or susceptibility @xmath18 ) with respect to the temperature ( or the density ) - a quantity called @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) in  @xcite .",
    "this is a non - standard linear dynamical response and is clearly an easily accessible quantity , which also shows a peak at times of the order of @xmath7 and whose height grows as the temperature is lowered  @xcite .",
    "this has lead to direct estimates of the size of the dynamical correlation length in supercooled liquids and glasses  @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath21 is however highly non - trivial and has been investigated thoroughly in  @xcite .",
    "it was realized in these papers that the existence of conserved quantities ( energy , density ) crucially affects the properties of @xmath16 , which depends both on the thermodynamic ensemble ( nve vs. npt for example ) and on the dynamics ( brownian vs. newtonian for example ) . the true glassy correlation length ,",
    "on the other hand , does not depend on these choices , and therefore the direct interpretation of @xmath22 in terms of a correlation volume is somewhat obscured . at a deeper level",
    ", the basic ingredient leading to the critical behaviour of @xmath16 turns out to be entirely contained in the response function @xmath21 itself , as the field theoretical analysis of  @xcite explicitely demonstrates and the numerical results presented there fully confirm .",
    "for example , for brownian dynamics or for newtonian dynamics in the nve ensemble , @xmath23 , whereas for newtonian dynamics in the nvt ensemble , one rather finds @xmath24 , see  @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "one of the two main results of this work consists in obtaining the precise relation between non - linear responses and probes of dynamical correlations introduced previously in the literature .",
    "in particular , we shall focus on the third - order non - linear dielectric response @xmath4 and work out its relationship with the dielectric dynamical susceptibility @xmath21 .",
    "the latter is known to be related to @xmath16 , see  @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "we will establish simple identities between @xmath25 and @xmath21 which hold whenever time - temperature superposition ( tts ) holds , i.e. whenever all dependence of the linear response of the system on external parameters ( temperature , density , electric field ,  ) comes through the dependence of the relaxation time on these parameters .",
    "this is a strict statement within mct , where a true dynamical phase transition takes place at a finite temperature @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we will show that at low enough frequency ( in fact much smaller than the inverse of the relaxation time ) , the following relation holds : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a slow varying function of the temperature , see the following sections for a precise definition .",
    "this relation is actually a consequence of a more general one relating @xmath4 to the standard linear response @xmath18 , which is also valid only at low frequency and reads : @xmath29 these simple relations do not extend over the whole frequency domain , however one could argue that they should do so in a scaling sense ( as long as the tts is valid ) . a general proof based on field theory along the lines of  @xcite is left for the future . in this work , we have checked that within mct this is indeed what happens .",
    "furthermore , within mct , we have also worked out the complete critical behavior of @xmath25 , which is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi3 ] .     as a function of @xmath30 , showing five different frequency regimes : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "note that the low frequency limit is non zero but much smaller than the peak value for @xmath37 close to @xmath26.,scaledwidth=74.0% ]    * in the @xmath0-regime , i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath4 growths and reaches its maximum , of height of order @xmath39 , after which it decreases as @xmath40 at large @xmath41 . in this regime , one has the scaling form : @xmath42 .",
    "* at the crossover between the early @xmath0-regime and late @xmath1-regime @xmath4 is of order @xmath43 .",
    "* in the @xmath1-regime , i.e. @xmath44 , @xmath4 dicreases as @xmath40 at small @xmath41 and as @xmath45 at large @xmath41 , with scaling form @xmath46    exponents @xmath47 and @xmath48 are well known critical exponents of mct , which characterize respectively how the correlators decay and exit of the plateau ; @xmath49 is a microscopic relaxation time . all along this paper , @xmath50 , the distance from the mode coupling critical temperature @xmath26 ,",
    "will be our control parameter .",
    "we remark that the existence of the peak and the decrease at low frequency is a non trivial prediction since it is in contrast to what happens for the ( trivial ) non - linear response of uncorrelated brownian dipoles  @xcite and for spin glasses ( the decrease with an exponent three at high frequency sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi3 ] is instead trivial and will be discussed later ) .    for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the quadratic non - linear susceptibility @xmath51 is zero for unpolarized systems",
    ". this would not be the case for example for polarized systems , or when considering the response to a density perturbation .",
    "indeed , the non - linear response to a density perturbation contains a quadratic term .",
    "the arguments presented below make it clear that in that case @xmath51 itself is directly related to @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore expect that all the results presented below can be straightforwardly generalized to describe the long - wavelength ( @xmath52 ) non - linear compressibility ( or more general non - linear rheological responses ) of supercooled liquids and colloids . moreover ,",
    "by adapting these arguments to the explicit results obtained for inhomogenous mode coupling theory  @xcite we will also extend these results to finite wavevectors @xmath53 and find that whenever tts holds , @xmath4 takes in the @xmath0-region the scaling form conjectured in  @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the dynamical correlation length which also appears in @xmath21 , and @xmath56 a certain critical exponent that within mct is equal to minus 2 .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first introduce the theoretical framework needed to deal with non - linear responses to an external field and establish some general relations between different quantities that naturally appear ( section  [ sec:1 ] ) .",
    "we then exploit - when they exist - the time - temperature superposition ( tts ) properties of the correlation function of glassy systems to establish in section [ sec:2 ] general relations , valid at low frequency , between @xmath25 and the temperature derivative of the linear response .",
    "the critical behavior of @xmath4 is obtained in section  [ sec:3 ] using scaling arguments and within mct .",
    "we finally discuss the extension of these results to spatially inhomogeneous perturbing fields and beyond mct .",
    "we end by a conclusion with open problems , possible extensions and experimental suggestions .",
    "in this section , we introduce the formalism needed to deal with non - linear response and establish a general relation between the non - linear susceptibility and a dynamical response function recently introduced in the literature , which was argued to capture the critical spatio - temporal correlations of the dynamics in the glassy region . in order to remain close to recent and ongoing experiments on glycerol",
    ", we use below the language of dielectric susceptibility .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , our arguments and results can be extended to more general non - linear susceptibilities ( mechanical , magnetic , etc . ) .",
    "let us consider a dipolar molecular liquid in presence of a small external electric field oscillating at frequency @xmath41 in the @xmath57-direction .",
    "we denote it as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the unit vector in the @xmath57 direction and @xmath60 is its @xmath57-component with peak field amplitude @xmath61    when the external field is sufficiently small , the polarization vector ( per particle ) @xmath62 can be expanded in powers of @xmath61 . in the following",
    "we will denote @xmath63 its @xmath57-component .",
    "due to the rotational symmetry in the @xmath11-@xmath64 plane the other components are identically zero .",
    "furthermore , because of the up - down symmetry in the @xmath57 direction , the polarization must be an odd function of @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath65 . as a consequence",
    ", the expansion of @xmath66 in powers of @xmath61 contains only odd terms : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be expressed as functional derivatives of the polarization with respect to the external field : @xmath70 it is important to remark that the linear and non - linear response kernels in the above integrals are time translation invariant ( tti ) , i.e. they do not change if all time variables are shifted by the same amount .",
    "this comes from the fact that they are _ equilibrium _ response functions , measured in absence of the external field . using this result and the specific form of the external field , eq .  ( [ eq : field ] ) ,",
    "one finds : @xmath71 which defines the usual frequency dependent linear susceptibility , @xmath18 , and the frequency dependent non - linear susceptibility , @xmath72 , while @xmath73 is the @xmath74 correction to the first harmonic susceptibility @xmath18 .",
    "the non - linear susceptibility @xmath4 , which is the quantity will focus on throughout this paper , can be accessed experimentaly by filtering @xmath75 terms at frequency @xmath76 .",
    "following the same procedure , one can expand in powers of the electric field the ( @xmath57-component ) polarization correlation and linear response functions of the system driven by the electric field @xmath77 .",
    "the up - down symmetry in the @xmath57 direction implies that they both are even functions of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore their expansion in power of @xmath61 contains only even terms : @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the unperturbed correlation and response functions in absence of the external field . at equilibrium , they are functions only of the time difference @xmath81 : @xmath82 and @xmath83 . moreover , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) holds for the unperturbed correlation and response functions : @xmath84 the second - order correlation and response functions appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a2 ] ) are defined as : @xmath85 @xmath86 the second order correlation function , @xmath87 , was introduced in the context of spin - glasses by huse  @xcite in the static limit , and more recently studied in details in  @xcite .",
    "neither tti nor fdt holds for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are explicit functions of both @xmath12 and @xmath90 .",
    "however , the response kernels appearing inside the above integrals are tti .",
    "using this property and developing the product of cosines in complex exponentials one finds easily that :    @xmath91      in the following we aim at establishing a relation between the second order response function defined above and the non - linear susceptibility . by definition ,",
    "the electric polarization is given by the convolution of the response function with the external field : @xmath92 therefore , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , we simply get that : @xmath93 and @xmath94 thus , the component of order @xmath95 of the polarization ( related to @xmath25 ) turns out to be just the convolution of the field with the function @xmath89 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d2rdef ] ) . as a consequence , using the above expression , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : a3 ] ) , we find , for an oscillating field at frequency @xmath41 : @xmath96 where we denoted @xmath97 and @xmath98 the semi - fourier transform ( with respect to @xmath99 ) at frequency @xmath100 of the coefficients appearing in the fourier expansion , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the previous equation allows us to establish a general relation between @xmath4 and the fourier transform of @xmath103 : @xmath104 this relation will be very useful .",
    "using scaling arguments we will now obtain the critical behavior of @xmath105 within mct .",
    "the relation above will then allow us to obtain straightforwardly the scaling behaviour of @xmath4 .",
    "in the following we focus on the evolution of the correlation and response function when the period of oscillation of the external field is much smaller than the relaxation time , in other words in the low - frequency limit @xmath106 . by definition all degrees of freedom relevant for this time - sector of the response or correlation relax on timescales much smaller than @xmath107 . as a consequence the correlation / response functions are expected to be given by their equilibrium expression in the presence of a quasi - constant external field @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , in this regime : @xmath109 since we are interested in the small @xmath61 behavior , we can expand the above expression up to second order in @xmath61 .",
    "for the response function , for instance , this yields : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the unperturbed equilibrium response function , and the derivative is computed with respect to a constant external field . comparing the last equation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : a3 ] ) in the stationary regime ( @xmath112 with @xmath113 finite ) we find a very simple expression for the @xmath114 component of the expansion @xmath105 in the regime @xmath115 : @xmath116 an analogous relation holds for the correlation function : @xmath117 these general results provide important insights to understand the behaviour of the non - linear susceptibility .",
    "first of all , since the correlation and response functions appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sl ] ) are defined in equilibrium in presence of a constant field , they must obey fdt .",
    "therefore one can establish a sort of generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation between the second order correlation and response functions , which reads : @xmath118 which is however only valid in the low frequency domain @xmath119 .",
    "the results of the previous section allow us to establish an interesting relation between the second order correlation and response functions and the _ dynamical response _ @xmath120 that was recently introduced and extensively studied in  @xcite , in particular in relation with the behaviour of the four - point dynamical correlation function .",
    "the key idea is that in the glassy dynamics regime , the equilibrium correlation function @xmath121 satisfies to a good approximation the time - temperature superposition ( tts ) principle .",
    "this means that the correlation function for different temperatures , densities , external fields , etc .",
    ", can be written as a function of @xmath122 , and the whole @xmath123 dependence is captured by the structural relaxation time @xmath124 .",
    "this becomes actually an exact statement within the @xmath0-regime of mct , when the system approaches the dynamical critical point . in this case , the dynamical critical temperature is expected to show a quadratic dependence on the external field ( for small fields ) of the form : @xmath125 close to the critical point , a small field changes slightly the critical temperature . since the only thing that matters for the critical behaviour is the distance from the critical point , one finds that applying a small field is equivalent to a small change in temperature .",
    "note that this implies that the relations found below carry over , within mct , to the @xmath1-regime as well .    more generally ,",
    "since @xmath124 is expected to be an even function of @xmath61 because of the up - down symmetry , it should rather be written as @xmath126 , with @xmath127 .",
    "then approximate tts immediately leads to : @xmath128 around @xmath129 one has @xmath130 ; using the above results one finds the very interesting relation ( valid for @xmath131 : @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "analogously one finds for the response function ( using the fdt relation ( [ eq : fdr ] ) ) : @xmath134 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi3 ] ) one directly finds the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath135 given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rel ] ) .",
    "one can in fact obtain a slightly more general relation provided the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi3 ] ) is dominated by the region @xmath136 .",
    "one then finds with some degree of generality that : @xmath137 and finally , using tts , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rel2 ] ) .",
    "this result is important because it establish a firm link with the linear dynamical responses that are often used to evaluate dynamical correlations .",
    "more generally , the amplitude of the correlation function also depends on temperature and electric field : @xmath138 and the derivative of @xmath139 brings extra contributions that affect the above equalities . in glassy systems , the relaxation time @xmath7 is usually most sensitive to external parameters , and it is reasonable to discard these corrections , except at zero frequencies where the above contribution is in fact zero .",
    "the case in spin - glasses is very different , because the correlation amplitude itself depends critically on temperature .",
    "in this section we analyze the behaviour of the non - linear susceptibility using general physical and scaling arguments .",
    "these results can be confirmed by an exact analysis of the schematic mode coupling ( p - spin ) equations . for sake of clarity of this paper ,",
    "the technical aspects related to the derivation of the schematic mct equations in presence of an external oscillating field and their analysis will presented in a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "the results above establish a clear connection between the dynamical response @xmath21 and the non - linear susceptibility @xmath25 . in the following",
    ", we will exploit the consequences of this connection within the mct framework , using scaling arguments .",
    "note that we will implicitely assume , as previously done in the literature , that the results obtained within mct for density correlation functions carry out to polarization fluctuations .",
    "in fact , experimentally , it has been established that the dielectric susceptibility probes the glassy dynamics as well as the density correlation functions , see e.g.  @xcite",
    ". a quantitative theory of dielectric polarization fluctuations and their coupling to density fluctuations in the slow dynamics regime would be certainly very involved due to the presence of onsager cavity fields  @xcite .",
    "let us now recall the behaviour of @xmath140 within mct  @xcite , where two critical relaxation regimes occur close to the mct transition : the @xmath1-regime , with relaxation time @xmath141 , and the @xmath0-regime , with relaxation time @xmath142 .",
    "the critical properties of @xmath140 have been derived in terms of scaling functions both in the @xmath0 and @xmath1-regimes  @xcite . using these results , the relations established above and the fdt of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdr ] ) , one can obtain the scaling behaviour of @xmath143 and @xmath105 close to the mct transition in the different _ time _ regimes .",
    "the strategy is the following : we start with very low frequencies , where we know the scaling behaviour from the relation with @xmath21 , and extend it to the whole regimes assuming that critical scaling holds . finally , from the scaling behavior of @xmath143 and @xmath105 we will obtain the one of @xmath4 .",
    "we will first analyse the @xmath1-regime and afterwards the @xmath0-regime .",
    "let us first analyze the regime @xmath136 . in this case , one can use the results ( [ eq : chit],[eqr : chit ] ) valid in the regime@xmath144 and the known behavior of @xmath21  @xcite to find : @xmath145 where the scaling function @xmath146 behaves asymptotically as @xmath147 for @xmath148 and as @xmath149 for @xmath150 , whereas @xmath151 behaves as @xmath152 for @xmath148 and as @xmath153 for @xmath150 .    on the other hand , for very large frequencies , such that @xmath154 , the field oscillates so fast that the system has no time to respond and one expects vanishing ( for @xmath155 ) small second order correlation and response functions .",

    "therefore , for probing frequencies of the order of the inverse of the @xmath1-relaxation time , the contribution to the non - linear susceptibility coming from the time integral in the @xmath0-regime is negligible in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi3 ] ) .",
    "one then finds that : @xmath203 where the function @xmath204 is defined as : @xmath205 the asymptotic behaviour of the scaling function @xmath206 can easily be obtained from the results of the previous section .",
    "one finds : @xmath207 using the asymptotic properties of @xmath208 and the fact that @xmath209 are between zero and one insures the convergence of the integrals appearing in the above equation , at both small and large @xmath210 .",
    "this confirms that the scaling behaviour of @xmath4 in this region is indeed dominated by the @xmath1-regime of @xmath105 .",
    "note that in the high frequency region the @xmath211 dependence of @xmath4 drops out , as it should in order to match the non critical @xmath212 frequency regime .",
    "we now consider the @xmath0-regime , where we set @xmath213 , and again assume that only the scaling form of @xmath214 in this same regime , eq .  ( [ asymp : alpha2_2 ] ) , contributes significantly to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the contribution due to the time integral in the @xmath1-regime is at least a factor @xmath215 smaller than the one coming from the @xmath0-regime , and yields a subleading contribution to the critical behavior of @xmath72 .",
    "we then find that the non - linear susceptibility scales as : @xmath216 where the function @xmath217 is defined as : @xmath218 clearly , because of the matching of @xmath219 for small first arguments with @xmath159 at large first arguments , we find that the scaling of the early @xmath0-regime ( @xmath220 ) of the non - linear susceptibility matches with that of the late @xmath1-regime ( @xmath221 ) , with : @xmath222      in the low frequency limit , one finds that @xmath4 decreases from its peak value @xmath223 reached for @xmath224 to a non critical , finite value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi3bis ] ) . as discussed in  @xcite , contrary to the case of spin - glasses ,",
    "the non - linear susceptibility is critical only for small but non zero values of the frequencies .",
    "zero frequency corresponds to a static equilibrium response ( or correlation , via fdt ) . in glasses ,",
    "these are not expected to have any critical behavior .",
    "in particular , in the low frequency limit , one can expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi3 ] ) up to second order in @xmath225 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfl ] ) we have : @xmath226 where the zero frequency limit of the linear susceptibility , @xmath227 , equals the static polarization fluctuations ( along the z - axis ) divided by temperature , @xmath228 .",
    "@xmath229 and @xmath230 are two temperature - independent constants defined as @xmath231 ( here we have used again the time - temperature superposition principle , writing @xmath232 ) .",
    "the last equations allows us to determine the low frequency behavior of the real and imaginary part of the non - linear susceptibility : @xmath233 with @xmath234 and @xmath235 .      at very large frequencies ( very small timescales ) the non - linear susceptibility is vanishing because the system has not enough time to respond to the oscillating field .",
    "one could argue that the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : d3p ] ) at very large frequencies yields : @xmath236 ^ 3.\\ ] ] as a result , at very large frequency the non - linear susceptibility behaves as : @xmath237 this analysis is oversimplified and assumes analytic properties of the function @xmath238 that are not granted and may depend strongly on the microscopic dynamics .",
    "for instance , in the case of ising spins with a monte carlo heath bath dynamics one can easily verify that the previous arguments do not apply and the large frequency behavior is proportional to @xmath239 .",
    "the conclusion is that the high frequency behavior depends on the underlying microscopic dynamics and , likely , on the type of the non - linear response considered . in the case of non - linear dielectric susceptibility",
    "the underlying microscopic dynamics should be provided by langevin equations for dipoles in a non - polar solvent ( this is an approximation since at extremely high frequency inertia effects will play a role ) . to work out the high frequency behavior",
    "one can neglect interactions with other dipoles and the coupling to structural relaxation .",
    "thus , the analysis of the non - linear response of a single dipole in a non - polar solvent worked out in  @xcite should apply .",
    "the outcome is the @xmath240 behavior discussed above .",
    "the previous scaling arguments are rather general .",
    "we emphasis here that they can be fully derived from a rigourous analysis of schematic mode coupling equations , in the framework of the spherical p - spin model in presence of an oscillating external field .",
    "analysing the equations up to second order in the external field , it is possible to determine the critical behaviour obtained using scaling arguments in the previous sections .    beyond the schematic approach , one may wonder about specific but important details such as the role of conserved variables like energy or density on the above results . as recalled in the introduction , we know that these conserved variables can dramatically change the scaling behaviour of @xmath16 for example , which also diverges as @xmath241 within a p - spin framework with langevin dynamics , but diverges as @xmath242 when the contribution of conserved variables is taken into account  @xcite . from a diagrammatic point of view , this is due to the presence of ` squared ladder ' diagrams which gives the dominant contribution to @xmath16 .",
    "one can check that due to the causality of the response functions , these diagrams in fact are absent when one computes the non - linear susceptibility and the above results are expected to hold for a _ bona fide _",
    "mct theory of liquids .",
    "thus , the result  @xcite : @xmath243 is expected to hold even beyond schematic mct ( @xmath244 is the dynamical correlation length which also appears in @xmath21 ) .",
    "a complete proof could be obtained generalizing the inhomogeneous mct calculation of  @xcite to account for a space and time dependent source term , that would describe the non - linear response to an oscillating field with wave - vector @xmath53 and frequency @xmath41 . in a first attempt",
    ", we adapt the previous scaling arguments to the explicit results of  @xcite on the wavevector - dependent dynamical response .",
    "this allow us to obtain the critical behavior of @xmath245 . in the @xmath1-regime",
    "one finds : @xmath246 where the scaling function @xmath247 is equal to @xmath204 for @xmath248 , i.e. for a uniform electric field one finds back eq .",
    "( [ scalingbeta ] ) . for large @xmath64",
    "one expects a power law behavior such as @xmath249 ( where @xmath250 is a certain scaling function ) . as discussed in  @xcite this",
    "is needed to cancel out the diverging prefactor @xmath251 and match the critical behavior to the non - critical one taking place for @xmath252 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior with respect to @xmath11 is identical to the one already described for homogeneous fields .",
    "very small @xmath11 correspond to the matching between @xmath0 and @xmath1 regimes . since in the @xmath0 regime",
    "@xmath25 is expected to diverge as @xmath253 , the matching imposes the behavior at small @xmath11 : @xmath254 ( where @xmath255 is another scaling function ) . for large @xmath11 values , the field varies so rapidly that the system has not enough time to adjust and to respond to the field .",
    "again , in order to cancel the diverging prefactor and match the non - critical behavior one expects a large @xmath11 behavior such as @xmath256 ( where @xmath257 is a third scaling function ) .",
    "it would be interesting to specify in more details the shape of the scaling functions @xmath258",
    ".    in the @xmath0 regime one expects : @xmath259 where the scaling function @xmath260 is equal to @xmath261 for @xmath248 , i.e. for a uniform electric field one finds back eq .",
    "( [ scalingalpha ] ) .",
    "the same kind of arguments used above suggests for large",
    "@xmath64 a power law behavior : @xmath262 ( where @xmath263 is a scaling function ) . for very small @xmath11",
    "the scaling function vanishes in order to match the @xmath264 value corresponds to the non - critical ( non diverging ) static non - linear susceptibility . for large @xmath11 values in order to match the @xmath1 regime one expects a behaviour such as @xmath265 ( where @xmath266 is another scaling function ) .    at this point , one may debate about the validity of the power law divergence of the relaxation time described by mode coupling theory and of tts .",
    "however , it is often observed that there are actually regimes , when the dynamics starts slowing down strongly , which are well described by mct ( and thus tts ) . in these regimes",
    "we expect our predictions for @xmath25 to hold , as it seems to be the case for @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was recently shown that mct may be corrected including higher order terms .",
    "it was found that these corrections only affect the values of exponents @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath26 , but do not affect strongly scaling functions  @xcite .",
    "this suggest that the mct mechanism for describing the slowing down is rather robust and that the mct regime could in principle being expanded at the price of changing the exponents ( in particular the one coverning the relaxation time , see e.g.  @xcite )",
    "in this work , we have studied in detail the non - linear response of supercooled liquids .",
    "although we are able to provide precise statements within a mode - coupling approach , some of our results are in fact more general and only require time - temperature superposition to hold . in particular we expect our results to hold in generalization of mode coupling theory such as  @xcite .",
    "an important theoretical result is the relation ( [ eq : chi3bis ] ) between the non - linear response @xmath4 and the temperature derivative of the usual linear susceptibility , @xmath267 , valid at small frequencies ( smaller than the inverse relaxation time ) .",
    "this bridges the gap between non - linear responses and probes of dynamic correlations such as three- and four - point correlations and temperature ( or density ) derivative of standard two - body correlations and response : they are all different facets of the same underlying physical phenomenon .    for larger frequencies - of the order of the inverse of the relaxation time",
    "- we have obtained a complete set of scaling predictions concerning the critical behavior of @xmath4 within mct .",
    "the main results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi3 ] .",
    "five different frequency regimes are identified : @xmath72 exhibits a peak around frequencies of the order of half the inverse of the structural relaxation time of the system @xmath7 .",
    "the height of the peak grows as @xmath241 ( or equivalently as @xmath253 ) as the critical temperature is approached . for higher frequencies",
    ", @xmath4 decays as power laws , with an exponent equal to @xmath268 in the late @xmath1-regime , to @xmath269 in the early @xmath1-regime , and finally to @xmath270 at high frequencies .",
    "our results should be directly applicable to the non - linear dielectric constant of molecular glasses in the weakly supercooled regime where mct is expected to be relevant , and for describing the non - linear compressibility or more general non - linear rheological responses of hard - sphere colloids close to the glass transition , where mct does a fair job at describing their relaxation properties .",
    "however , it is well known that mct fails for deeply supercooled liquids , when activated events start playing a major role in the relaxation .",
    "the detailed shape of @xmath4 would require a full theoretical description of the dynamics in this regime , which is unavailable to date .",
    "still , the general low frequency relation between @xmath25 and @xmath271 , supplemented with the property of time - temperature superposition , allows one to give a firmer basis to the scaling relation conjectured in  @xcite , namely that : @xmath272 where @xmath273 is a scaling function , and @xmath274 is the peak value of the temperature derivative of @xmath18 , as measured in  @xcite . following  @xcite , we expect @xmath275 to increase as a power of the dynamical correlation length @xmath276",
    ". the detailed shape of @xmath273 would obviously be worth knowing in order to compare with upcoming experimental results . as a guide",
    ", we give the result obtained assuming a havriliak - nagami form for the susceptibility and the validity of the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath271 at all frequencies , which has no justification apart from suggesting possible fitting functions .",
    "one finds : @xmath277 where @xmath278 are fitting exponents .    among open problems worth investing",
    "is the extension of the present theory to the aging regime of glasses and spin - glasses . from an experimental point of view",
    ", a detailed study of the role of the electric field on the glass properties of dipolar liquids ( such as glycerol ) would be very interesting .",
    "for example , the evolution of the glass transition temperature as a function of the field @xmath61 would allow one to measure the proportionality coefficient @xmath28 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi3bis ] ) . in spin - glasses ,",
    "a detailed measurement of @xmath72 would allow to shed light on the existence of spin - glass transition at non zero field , as argued in  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath279 in the aging phase would furthermore be a very useful probe of the aging process in spin - glasses , in particular during rejuvenation cycles .",
