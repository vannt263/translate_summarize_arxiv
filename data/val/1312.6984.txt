    "this is consistent with the physical expectation that se is of intralayer nature while @xmath38 and @xmath51 are the only @xmath33 orbitals lying mostly inside the @xmath52 plane .",

    "considering such @xmath33-like lwfs on the hexagonal lattices , a large afm hopping integral is thus expected along the path of fe(mn)-o - fe(mn )  @xcite .",
    "based on the same orbital symmetry argument , it can be easily seen that the diagonal hopping is relatively smaller for @xmath49 character and almost zero for @xmath54 character .",
    "this is because @xmath23 and @xmath39(@xmath55 ) require that the main orbital lobe to be located along @xmath56 or within the @xmath57(@xmath58 ) plane which make the hopping integrals much smaller .",
    "strikingly , the se interactions also show fundamental difference between the two materials . in hlfo(fe@xmath21:@xmath59 ) , the @xmath23 orbital of @xmath60 symmetry is singly occupied and se interactions can only be of afm types .",
    "however , @xmath23 is empty in hlmo ( mn@xmath21:@xmath61 ) , se interactions are thus composed of competing afm and fm types and the coupling strength is further reduced by the forbidden hopping involving the empty @xmath23 .",
    "thus , a significantly larger afm coupling energy is observed in hlfo .",
    "this is consistent with the higher nel temperature in hlfo observed in experiment in addition to the larger spin on the fe site .",

    "this is the key to understanding the mechanism of sr and weak fm moment below t@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "compared to the se nature of intralayer exchange , the interlayer fe ions are coupled by the super super exchange interaction ( sse )  @xcite , in which one fe atom at @xmath15 is in exchange interaction with three first neighbor fe atoms at @xmath16 mediated by two apical oxygen atoms ( o@xmath64 ) . due to the p6@xmath65 cm structure in fig .",
    "[ spinphonon_coupling ] ( b ) , the three sse paths can be further simplified by two independent sse coupling strengths : @xmath40 through fe@xmath66-o-@xmath67-o - fe@xmath68 and @xmath41 through fe@xmath66-o-@xmath67-o - fe@xmath69 respectively . as a result , the @xmath62 spin hamiltonian in eq .",

    "since the non - zero @xmath77 comes from the structural distortion ( p6@xmath0/mmc @xmath2 p6@xmath0 cm ) , the low temperature spin reorientation must have a structural origin .",

    "similar to that of @xmath24 mode , the slope is also positive , favoring the sr from @xmath17 to @xmath18 phase .    finally , we focus on the coupling between @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is ferroelectric phonon mode at zone center .",
    "the atomic displacements of this mode involve all the lu , o , and fe atoms moving along @xmath13 .",

    "not surprisingly , our theory predicts a zero dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath78 mode amplitude .",
    "it indicates that this ferroelectric distortion alone does not play any role in sr .",
    "the significantly different coupling strengths of @xmath77 with the phonon modes suggests the primary role of @xmath24 phonon mode in sr of hlfo .",
    "indeed , when @xmath24 mode is frozen into the experimental structural coordinates at t=300 k perturbatively , @xmath40 and @xmath41 rapidly increases and decreases respectively and sr occurs at the crossing point as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) separating the @xmath17 from @xmath18 phase .",
    "below , we show that @xmath84 saturates at close to t@xmath6 , while @xmath83 changes significantly from 300 k to 20 k using xrd and xas measurements .    as shown in fig.[fig_xray](a ) , the temperature dependence of the normalized intensity ratio between ( 104 ) and ( 004 ) peaks appears to saturate when temperature is lowered to t@xmath6 .",
    "we attribute the saturation to the slow variation of @xmath90 phonon at low temperature , because @xmath7 is expected to have a dominant effect here , according to the simulated intensity ratio ( fig.[fig_xray](a ) inset )  @xcite , while the zone center mode @xmath91 is expected to have no effect .",
    "the saturation of @xmath90 mode can be further confirmed by the temperature dependence of the lattice constant @xmath13 which follows closely to that of the intensity ratio , as shown in fig.[fig_xray](a ) .",
    "the displacement of the @xmath7 mode includes a rotation of the feo@xmath9 trigonal bipyramid , which changes the shape of the unit cell by enlarging @xmath92 and reducing @xmath13  @xcite ; the change of @xmath13 ( @xmath93 ) is proportional to @xmath94 for small change of @xmath84 .",
    "the matching temperature dependence in fig.[fig_xray](a ) suggests that the change of @xmath13 is indeed caused by the @xmath7 mode which saturates at low temperature .",
    "xas measurements suggest that the @xmath24 mode undergoes a gradual change at low temperature .",
    "previously , we assigned the fe-3d crystal levels using the xas at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_xray](b ) , the temperature dependences of the energy levels all show broad peak - like features with the maxima close to t@xmath6 .",
    "the crystal field levels of fe-3d are expected to be sensitive to the shape of feo@xmath9 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_phonon_mag](a ) , the @xmath7 mode causes a rotation of the feo@xmath9 while the @xmath24 or @xmath8 modes cause distortions of the feo@xmath9 , so the energy - level shift observed in fig . [",
    "fig_xray](c ) are most likely generated by the change of @xmath83 or @xmath85 .",
    "[ fig_xray](c ) shows a simulation  @xcite of the energy level change of the crystal field levels as functions of @xmath83 or @xmath85 with respect to the value when all the mode displacements are zero . according to the simulation , the @xmath24 mode generates a maximum at @xmath95 while @xmath85 generates a minimum at @xmath96",
    "; this is because the @xmath24 mode move both o@xmath64 atoms away from the fe sites and make the feo@xmath9 larger while the @xmath8 mode pushes one o@xmath64 atom close to fe site . comparing the simulation and the observation , we infer that the @xmath24 mode changes gradually when the temperature is lowered , in order to generate the maximum @xcite ; this is consistent with the theoretical prediction in which @xmath83 changes when the temperature is lowered and causes the transition from antiferromagnetism in b@xmath25 phase to weak ferromagnetism in a@xmath25 phase .",
    "hence , the roles of all three structural distortions are elucidated in hlfo : the instability of @xmath7 mode is the driving force of the p6@xmath0/mmc @xmath2 p6@xmath0 cm structural transition ; the improper ferroelectricity of @xmath8 mode is induced by frozen @xmath7 mode  @xcite ; the competing effect between @xmath24 and @xmath7 modes determines the magnetic ordering and drives the magnetic phase transition .",
    "if the @xmath24 mode can be tuned by interface engineering  @xcite , the @xmath97 can be increased , achieving the spontaneous electric and magnetic polarizations and their couplings at room temperature .",
