    "colloidal dispersions have been established as model systems in materials science .",

    "equilibrium statistical mechanics explains equilibrium phases and their near - equilibrium properties based on direct particle interactions .",
    "while purely repulsive interactions lead to fluid and crystalline solids , attractions can also give rise to liquids .",
    "as colloidal dispersions offer the unique possibility to tailor the depth and range of the attractions , the conditions when liquid phases become stable could be established in studies e.g.  by @xcite . yet colloidal dispersions also form various _ metastable solid states _ like fractal networks , particle gels , and glasses , which can not be described with purely equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "they are important in industrial processes and products , and in biological systems , which generally are far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the specific mechanical properties of the resulting soft solids are often tailored adjusting the competition between attractive and repulsive interactions .",
    "various solid states , with very different elastic properties , have been prepared ; recent studies include works by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .    mixtures of colloids with non - adsorbing polymers constitute one of the simplest systems , where effective interactions among the ( larger ) colloidal constituents can be adjusted in a controlled way .",
    "two different glass states , viz .",
    "amorphous solids formed by the freezing - in of the cooperative structural dynamics , could be observed conclusively by @xcite and @xcite , as had been predicted by @xcite and @xcite using mode coupling theory . controlling the range of the attraction proved crucial for the formation of attraction driven glasses , where particles form physical bonds to their neighbors .",
    "attraction driven glasses require short ranged attractions so that particles become tightly localized , as can be clearly seen in computer simulations @xcite . in repulsion driven glasses , the cooperative behavior of the neighbors forming the cage localizes particles less tightly .",
    "the localization length there corresponds to lindemann s length @xcite which is roughly a tenth of the average particle separation @xcite .",
    "lindemann had found that atomic displacements increase up to this value when ( crystalline ) solids are heated to their melting temperature .",
    "mode coupling theory as developed by @xcite and others established that lindemann s length also characterizes the frozen - in structure of repulsion driven glasses , as was verified experimentally by @xcite and @xcite in colloidal hard sphere dispersions .",
    "as attractions change the structure of these glasses only if they are of short range  mode coupling theory predicts that qualitative changes require attraction ranges ( somewhat ) shorter than lindemann s length  and as attractions in molecular systems act across longer ranges , molecular glass transitions fall into the class of repulsion driven transitions .",
    "this has made hard sphere colloids a model system for studying the glass transition in molecular , metallic , and simple supercooled liquids , which was recently reviewed by @xcite .",
    "attraction driven glasses require attraction strengths of the order of only a few @xmath0 ( thermal energies ) and can form at particle concentrations lower than repulsive ones @xcite .",
    "the aspect that increasing the strength of attraction at first destabilizes and melts the ( repulsion driven ) glass , provides insight into the mechanism of vitrification and its theoretical description . for any strength , short ranged attractions increase the equilibrium probability of close - particle contacts , viz .",
    "the contact value of the pair correlation function . yet",
    ", this increased stickiness reduces the medium - ranged order in the disordered fluid as measured in the principal peak of the equilibrium structure factor . mode coupling theory predicts that this decrease destabilizes the repulsion driven cages so that a hard sphere glass melts upon turning on a narrow attraction .",
    "this causes an appreciable shift of the glass transition to higher concentrations . in a recent investigation",
    ", @xcite achieved a shift of the transition packing fraction by more than 10 % . for fixed concentration",
    ", short ranged attractions then cause a glass transition when at increasing attraction strength large wavevector contributions in the equilibrium structure factor contribute strongly .",
    "inbetween , a reentrant fluid region lies where equilibrium is approached at long times .",
    "the continuation of this states diagram to lower concentrations , where colloidal gels are observed @xcite , remains an active area of research .",
    "e.g.  computer simulations investigate it by following the temporal evolution of the average localization length of individual particles as function of concentration @xcite .",
    "metastable glassy systems exhibit a complex interplay between their structural relaxation and flow causing a strongly non - newtonian response .",
    "moreover , the structural and mechanical changes during or after processing using flow or other external fields also are crucial for achieving desired material properties .",
    "thixotropy and ageing are important , and are moving into the reach of first principles theories only recently @xcite . while a number of studies exists of the mechanical response of dispersions approaching the repulsion driven glass transition  a recent one @xcite where the transition density could be approached very closely is reviewed by @xcite",
    " there are far fewer studies of the nonlinear rheology in the complete region covering repulsion and attraction driven glass transitions .",
    "besides the already mentioned work by @xcite combining rheology and dynamic light scattering , especially the seminal investigations by @xcite and @xcite provided insights into the nonlinear mechanical behavior under different rheological protocols and varying repulsive and attractive effects by varying concentration and attraction strength .",
    "as also seen in computer simulations by @xcite , the linear shear moduli are far larger at the attraction driven glass transition than at the repulsion driven one . in mode coupling theory",
    "this arises from the dominance of large wavevectors in the approximated green - kubo relation for the linear moduli , which predicts an increase with the square of the inverse of the relative attraction range in the sticky limit @xcite .",
    "another intriguing observation by pham and coworkers concerns the yielding of glasses under applied strain .",
    "a typical strain of around 10% to 20 % characterizes the shear - induced yielding of repulsion driven glasses when experiencing step strain and start - up flow , while attraction driven glasses yield in a two - step process .",
    "the former observation , in agreement with light scattering studies under large amplitude oscillatory shearing by @xcite , nicely ties to the picture of the cage effect and its characteristic length following lindemann s criterion ; yet this connection has not been established theoretically up to now . the second observation , already visible in oscillatory shear experiments by @xcite and supported by a detailed investigation under start - up shear flow by @xcite , can not be interpreted so easily by the cage picture because the two characteristic strain values are around 10% and 100 % .",
    "the second value is far larger than the local cage picture would imply , and the attraction range , which was around 5% in the experimental system , appears not to characterize the stress - strain relations .",
    "aim of the present contribution is to determine the stress - strain relations close to repulsion and attraction driven glass transitions from mode coupling theory ( mct ) as generalized to sheared colloidal dispersions in the integration - through - transients ( itt ) framework .",
    "we will consider the quintessential repulsive glass transition , viz .",
    "the one in a hard sphere fluid , and a typical attraction driven one for a narrow square - well pair potential . specifically , we will consider start - up shear flow with fixed shear rate and determine the transient shear stress as function of accumulated strain . in the generalization of the microscopic mode coupling theory developed by @xcite based on the work by @xcite , the structural relaxation under arbitrary , homogeneous , and incompressible flows",
    "is deduced from the equilibrium structure factor so that caging and bond formation , as in the quiescent situation , can be discussed .    our work bears similarity to the study by @xcite where hard disks were considered in two dimensions . here",
    "we present the first calculations within microscopic mct - itt for hard spheres in three dimensions and additionally consider attractive glasses in the second part .",
    "our work also bears some similarity to the one by @xcite , who , however , concentrated on fluid states under shear and on time - dependent fluctuations around the steady state .",

    "our work also bears similarity to the study by @xcite in the present volume of the journal of rheology , who also consider the non - linear rheology of repulsion and attraction dominated glass transitions .",
