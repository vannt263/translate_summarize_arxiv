    "it has been recognized for many years that the nearest star - forming regions exhibit little evidence for stars of ages @xmath6  myr , even though one would expect that such `` post - t tauri stars '' ( pttss ) should be more numerous than the @xmath7  myr - old t tauri stars .",
    "more than a decade ago , herbig , vrba , & rydgren ( 1986 ) stated that `` it is a source of some unease that this large population of pttss has not yet been identified . '' since that time , a variety of techniques have been used to search for pttss , including proper motion surveys , fainter objective prism plates , ccd photometric selection . as outlined in  2 ,",
    "none of these techniques has yielded evidence for pttss in any significant numbers .",
    "the lack of pttss , combined with the presence of newly - formed stars in all substantial nearby molecular clouds , is most simply explained if molecular clouds like taurus come together , form stars , and disperse in a few myr .",
    "however , this simple picture causes difficulties for current theories of star formation . since taurus has a spatial extent of 20 pc , but the molecular gas has a velocity dispersion of only about 2  , it is difficult to understand how such widely separated regions produced stars almost simultaneously , i.e. , how star formation is `` triggered '' throughout the cloud on a scale shorter than the crossing ( or dynamical ) timescale . in principle , a single powerful event like a supernova explosion might trigger star formation in a molecular cloud over short timescales , but there is no obvious candidate for this triggering source in the case of taurus ( elmegreen 1993a ) .",
    "in addition , taurus is supposed to be the archetype for the `` standard '' picture of isolated , low - mass star formation , in which magnetically subcritical cloud cores collapse to form stars only after ambipolar diffusion has removed excess magnetic flux on timescales of order 5 - 10  myr ( shu , adams , &  lizano 1987 ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "if protostellar cloud cores are highly subcritical , the long ambipolar diffusion timescale makes it difficult to understand star formation events lasting only a few myr .",
    "a long diffusion time also is difficult to reconcile with statistics of cloud cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "palla &  galli ( 1997 ) argued that the ambipolar diffusion timescale simply introduces an age offset . in this picture",
    ", the molecular cloud cores which produced the present - day taurus stars started contracting , say , 11 - 12  myr ago , so that the cores have only become supercritical and started collapsing over the last 1 - 2  myr .",
    "however , there is no unique ambipolar diffusion timescale ; it depends upon the ionization fraction , which in turn depends upon precise conditions of shielding ( @xcite ) , and on how subcritical the cloud core is initially .",
    "thus it is difficult to understand how ambipolar diffusion does not introduce a spread of at least several myr into the onset of star formation .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by fiedler &  mouschovias ( 1993 ) , nakano ( 1998 ) , and hartmann ( 1998 ) , strongly subcritical clouds must be confined by external pressure to prevent disruption by expansion .",
    "the possibility of producing a steady external pressure in the generally turbulent environment of molecular clouds has been questioned recently by , , &  scalo ( 1998 = @xcite ) , who suggest that the turbulent motions are not steady , and can disrupt as well as compress clouds . given these problems and the evidence of the stellar population , it appears likely that ambipolar diffusion is not a major constraint on the timescale of star formation in taurus , as argued by nakano ( 1998 ) on general grounds , and as proposed many years ago by shu , adams , & lizano ( 1987 ) for much denser regions .",
    "even if the ambipolar diffusion timescale is not relevant , there still remains the problem of triggering star formation in taurus .",
    "this is possible in a dynamical scheme , where large - scale turbulent streams collide , collecting the material they are advecting and creating density fluctuations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; , passot &  pouquet 1995 = @xcite ; @xcite ; see also  et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this picture",
    "the formation of molecular clouds can not be considered separately from the formation of their parent diffuse h  i clouds .",
    "if molecular gas clouds like taurus are `` assembled '' by the convergence of higher - velocity neutral hydrogen flows , one might explain the nearly - simultaneous star formation over larger distance scales without invoking a single triggering event , like a sn explosion .    in this paper",
    "we consider the dynamical , kinematic and spatial relationship between the neutral hydrogen and molecular gas in the taurus region .",
    "our analysis is based on h  i and  observations , showing that in many places there is h  i which appears to be dynamically correlated with the molecular gas , but with substantial velocity offsets and larger velocity dispersions .",
    "the dynamical timescales for the clouds are then given by the scale of the clouds divided by the velocity dispersion of the external h  i , contrary to the assumption that the internal velocity dispersion is the relevant quantity .",
    "we further show that these results are qualitatively consistent with mhd simulations of the ism , suggesting that the molecular clouds like taurus can be rapidly assembled , eliminating the need to find pttss in the present molecular gas complex .",
    "in  [ ttauriproblem ] we review the observations leading to the post t - tauri problem . in  [ observations ]  we explore the dynamical relationship between h  i and co gas in the taurus region , while in  [ simulations ]  we show simulations of the ism dynamics which we use to interpret the observations in  [ turbcompresions ] .",
    "finally , we point out limitations of our simulations in  [ limitations ] , and summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "analyses of molecular cloud lifetimes have rarely included constraints from their stellar populations ; yet the ages of the stars produced by these clouds provide uniquely detailed constraints on cloud ages that are not obtainable in any other way ( e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "1991 ; feigelson 1996 ) .",
    "because of the importance of the stellar population ages , it is worth reviewing the situation in some detail , especially given some of the conflicting literature on the subject .",
    "we focus on the taurus - auriga molecular cloud complex , where the most detailed observational efforts have been made .    to illustrate the problem , figure 1  a shows the hr diagram for stars in the taurus - auriga molecular cloud region , with stellar luminosities and effective temperatures taken from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "the great majority of the stars have ages near 1  myr ; approximately half are younger than this , while only a few stars have ages greater than 3  myr ( see fig  1  b ) .",
    "the group of stars near the 100  myr isochrone ( i.e. , near the zero - age main sequence ) were discovered through early _ einstein _",
    "x - ray surveys ( walter et al . 1988 , and references therein ) .",
    "these stars were originally suggested by walter et al .",
    "( 1988 ) as members of the missing pttss population .",
    "however , there is a striking gap in the hr diagram ; there are very few stars filling in the age range between @xmath8 and @xmath9  myr .",
    "this gap makes it very unlikely that a single , reasonably continuous star formation event is responsible for both the near - zams stars and the young t tauri stars .",
    "furthermore , with such large ages it is difficult to connect these stars with the present taurus molecular cloud .",
    "walter et al . ( 1988 ) found ages for these stars @xmath10 30  myr at a modest velocity dispersion of 2  , typical of taurus molecular gas .",
    "these stars can have traveled 60 pc from their birth - sites during their lifetimes , 3 times the diameter of the taurus molecular complex .",
    "the apparent coordination of star formation on relatively short timescales in taurus ( and other regions ) has led to several efforts to identify hypothetical older stars which might be present but missed in previous objective prism surveys dependent upon strong h@xmath11 emission .",
    "herbig , vrba , &  rydgren ( 1986 ) obtained objective prism data covering the ca  ii h and k emission lines , which are present in much older stars .",
    "indeed , herbig et al .",
    "( 1986 ) identified several outlying members of the hyades in their survey ( see also hartmann , soderblom , &  stauffer 1987 ) , but failed to identify any older pttss .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and gomez et al .",
    "( 1992 ) used proper - motion surveys to try to select members of taurus without regard to emission line properties ; again , no substantially older stars were found .",
    "it has been suggested that recent x - ray surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have discovered the missing pttss .",
    "however , the ages of the typical g and early k stars in these samples are uncertain , because neither x - ray activity nor li depletion clearly discriminate between 1  myr - old t tauri stars and 100  myr - old stars .",
    "it seems likely that most of these objects are 30 - 100  myr - old stars , given their numbers and properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recent measurements of li depletion ( @xcite ) and limits on the m star component of the g - k rosat survey population ( @xcite ) support the idea that most of the dispersed x - ray population is much older than 10  myr .",
    "indeed , it is difficult to explain the spatial distributions of these stars if they are much younger .",
    "the dispersed x - ray sources are spread fairly uniformly over large distances ( up to 70  pc in projected distance from the center of taurus ) ; it would be very difficult to move stars from the present molecular regions this far at typical velocity dispersions of @xmath10 2  in anything less than about 30  myr . instead , it seems much more likely that these stars are mostly @xmath12  myr - old objects which formed in a variety of individual regions whose molecular gas has by now dispersed ( @xcite ) .",
    "whatever the exact age of the einstein- and rosat - discovered young stars , they do not seem to represent the `` missing '' stars in taurus of ages 3 - 10  myr .",
    "another approach has been to consider whether the ages of the taurus stars have been systematically underestimated .",
    "for example , the evolutionary tracks of swenson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) give ages for taurus stars that would be several times larger than those of dantona &  mazzitelli ( 1994 ) , which were used in figure  [ figuralee ] .",
    "however , as pointed out by stauffer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , if one modifies the calibrations of evolutionary tracks so that the calculations match the zero - age main sequence , most of the age discrepancy between those works disappears .",
    "another possibility was raised by hartmann &  kenyon ( 1990 ) , who suggested that the effects of accretion might produce spurious age estimates , but more recent investigations ( hartmann , cassen , &  kenyon 1997 ; siess , forestini , &  bertout 1997 ) indicate that t tauri accretion has little effect , making the stars appear slightly older , not younger .",
    "one may also note ( @xcite ) that most of the pre - main sequence stars in taurus lie within 1 - 2 pc of dense molecular gas ; at a velocity of 1 - 2  , this suggests that these stars have not been dispersing for more than 1 - 2  myr from their natal material , in agreement with the conventional hr diagram ages .",
    "thus , all the taurus observational constraints are consistent with a picture in which the molecular gas comes together and forms stars in @xmath13  myr , so that few stars of ages 3 - 10 myr are expected .",
    "the widely - distributed x - ray sources mostly represent stars which , though relatively young , are generally substantially older than 10  myr , and it is likely that their natal molecular clouds no longer exist .",
    "a general absence of pttss implies not only that clouds form stars rapidly , but that star - formation timescales are also relatively short . since taurus is still forming stars , its ultimate dispersal time is not known .",
    "studies of other regions such as cha i and ic 348 ( lawson et al .",
    "1996 ; herbig 1998 ) provide relatively little evidence for large populations of pttss , especially when older rosat sources are eliminated and mass - dependent biases are eliminated . from the absence of known molecular cloud regions containing 10  myr - old stars , it appears that the molecular gas may also disperse in a few myr , a timescale consistent with the cluster survey results of leisawitz , bash , & thaddeus ( 1989 ) . in this picture",
    "many molecular clouds will not have substantial populations of pttss .",
    "the taurus clouds are well - suited for understanding gas dynamics as well as the stellar population .",
    "the taurus molecular cloud ( tmc ) is one of the most well - studied molecular clouds in the sky , with extensive h  i and co maps ; it is one of the nearest clouds and lies well below the galactic plane , making it easier to isolate the h  i associated with the co cloud from the general material in the galactic plane .",
    "finally , the morphology and kinematics of tmc suggests a close relationship between the molecular and atomic gas ( see phd thesis and series of papers by @xcite , and references therein ) .    in the following discussion",
    "we make use of both h  i and data .",
    "the 21 cm line data were taken from the atlas of galactic neutral hydrogen ( @xcite ) obtained with the 25 m leiden / dwingeloo telescope , while the  molecular data have been taken from ungerechts &  thaddeus ( 1987 ) , obtained with the columbia millimeter - wave telescope .",
    "details of the observations and analysis may be found in the original papers . here",
    "we note that both data sets have 0.5 degree spatial resolution , which facilitates comparison .",
    "the velocity resolution of the h  i data is 1.03  , slightly lower than that of the co data , 0.65  . to overlap the co and atomic maps , we transformed the molecular data set ( originally in ( ra , dec ) ) to galactic coordinates @xmath14 by triangulating and re - sampling the transformed data in a half degree resolution grid .",
    "we present both sets of data extending from 140 to 201 degrees in galactic longitude , and from @xmath15 to @xmath16 in galactic latitude ( note that the original  data does not cover the whole range .",
    "we only add zeros in the external region , in order to match the h  i and  data at large scales ) .",
    "figure  [ hico ] shows a velocity - integrated map in  ( isocontours ) and h  i ( gray - scale ) for the velocity range where the co data has been obtained ( @xmath1720.33  @xmath18 29.1  ) .",
    "the straight lines indicate the loci of the cuts along which the velocity - position diagrams shown in figure  [ cutposvel ] are made . assuming an optically thin medium , the h  i intensity ( in k ) can be considered as proportional to the column density with a conversion factor of 1.8  cm2 .",
    "the gray scale range in figure  [ hico ] corresponds to a column density range from @xmath10  2.5  cm2 ( darker pixels ) , to a few times  cm2 ( white pixels ) . a column density of cm2 , corresponding to @xmath19 , is generally taken to be roughly the minimum column density needed for sufficient shielding of the uv radiation field to produce co ( e.g. , elmegreen 1993a ) .",
    "in figure  [ cutposvel ] we present a set of six velocity - position diagrams for both the h  i and  emission .",
    "the first two panels ( cuts 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ hico ] ) are the velocity - position diagrams for the region that formally is known as tmc , in which  has been detected ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; etc . ) . figure  [ cutposvel ]  c ( cut 3 ) corresponds to the region associated with perseus arm , and shows a strong velocity gradient , from @xmath10 8 - 10  to @xmath20  .",
    "figure  [ cutposvel ]  d ( cut 4 ) corresponds to the northernmost region mapped by ungerechts &  thaddeus ( 1987 ) . in figure  [ cutposvel ]  e ( cut 5 ) we present a velocity - position diagram that covers a large region , going from high southern latitudes to close to the galactic plane .",
    "finally , in figure  [ cutposvel ]  f ( cut 6 ) we show the velocity - position diagram for the nearby cloud l1457 .",
    "in particular , note from figure  [ cutposvel]d and e that at low galactic latitudes the h  i exhibits a large velocity spread due to the detection of material at a wide range of distances in the galactic plane .",
    "however , once one moves out of the plane a sufficient distance ( @xmath21 ) , the h  i velocity width becomes substantially smaller .",
    "the h  i velocity peak is generally fairly close to , although not identical with , the co peak .",
    "this reflects the fact that the  and h  i emission are spatially and kinematically related , suggesting that they are produced as part of a single dynamical complex ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "> from figure  [ cutposvel ] the following features can be noted .",
    "first , wherever there is a  feature , h  i is also found , with an approximate column density similar to that required by shielding ( see above ) .",
    "second , the converse is not true : not all h  i in this velocity system is associated with molecular gas .",
    "third , at a given spatial position , the h  i emission often does not peak at the same velocity than the ; frequently there is an offset of a few  between the two species .",
    "fourth , velocity widths in the h  i spectra are larger than the  spectra by a factor of roughly 3 or more .",
    "fifth , both the  and h  i line profiles are asymmetric , as indicated by the variation of gray - scale and contours in figure  [ cutposvel]a - l .",
    "these characteristics have been noticed previously in other regions ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and we shall focus on these properties when comparing with numerical simulations in the next section .",
    "to interpret the significance of the observed features of the atomic and molecular gas enumerated at the end of  [ observations ] , we turn to numerical simulations of the interstellar medium by passot , , &  pouquet ( 1995 = @xcite ) .",
    "these two - dimensional simulations represent the behavior of a one square kiloparsec of the ism centered at the solar galactocentric distance .",
    "the simulations solve the mhd equations , including self - gravity , parameterized cooling and diffuse heating , the coriolis force , large - scale shear , and parameterized localized stellar energy input due to ionization heating .",
    "the parameterized cooling is as in @xcite , who fitted piecewise power laws to the standard cooling calculations of @xcite and @xcite ( see , passot , &  pouquet 1996 = @xcite for details ) . as discussed in @xcite , the cooling and diffuse heating time scales are in general much shorter than the dynamical time scales , implying that the flow is always in thermal equilibrium , except in the vicinity of star formation sites .",
    "we refer to the reader to @xcite for further details in the equations and the model itself , and to the video accompanying @xcite , which gives an animated view of the dynamics of the ism and shows the transient character of the clouds .",
    "because the present mhd simulations do not include chemistry , we adopt a picture in which molecular clouds are the `` tips of the icebergs '' of the density features in the simulations .",
    "we define a ` molecular ' cloud as a connected set of pixels with density above some density threshold @xmath22 .",
    "the selection of this density threshold is arbitrary , but it must be a compromise between realistic values for molecular clouds and the limitations of the simulations . because the densest and smallest structures in the simulations reach values @xmath23 50  -  100  cm3 , we select a density threshold of 35 cm3 , unless otherwise stated",
    ". for comparison , typical mean densities in molecular clouds start at roughly 20  cm3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , an average value of 15 cm3 is reported for rosette molecular cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations have a mean density of @xmath24  cm3 , which corresponds to a mean column density of @xmath25  cm3 integrating through the 1  kpc box .",
    "this value is large enough to envision enough shielding to uv radiation to form molecular hydrogen ( see e.g. franco &  cox 1986 ) .    for the analysis here",
    ", we use a run presented in ballesteros - paredes , vzquez - semadeni &  rodrguez ( 1997 = @xcite ) called run 28.800 , which has a resolution of 800 @xmath0 800 pixels . in order to mimic as much",
    "as possible the conditions in taurus , we turn off the star formation at @xmath26  myr ( 5.3 code units ) .",
    "this allows us to increase the density contrasts , and to avoid the heating from massive stars , which are not present in taurus .",
    "then , we follow the time evolution of a relatively small cloud , which is localized far away from the big cloud complexes formed in the simulations .      in figure  [ nube_evol ] we show a time - sequence of a subsection of the whole box of the simulation , starting 7.02  myr after the time in which we turn off the star formation .",
    "the grey scale indicates the density field , ranging from 0.31 to 56.6  cm3 , and arrows denote the velocity field in the reference frame of the cloud .",
    "the snapshots are separated by @xmath27 0.39  myr ( 0.03 time code units ) .",
    "the black isocontour is the region where the density values are higher than 35  cm3 .",
    "note that the cloud is located where the velocity field converges , as required by the continuity equation .",
    "also , one observes rapid growth ( within less than 2 myr ) of a `` cloud '' above our density threshold which is approximately 20 pc in length ( each pixel unit is 1.25  pc ) , comparable to the length of the main taurus clouds .    to show that the density features observed in the simulations are produced by the confluence of external large - scale streams rather than other way around ( e.g. , the velocities being the consequence of , say , gravitational collapse of the cloud ) , we calculate the time evolution of both characteristic lengths and energies for the density features in fig .",
    "[ nube_evol ] .",
    "we select a connected set of pixels with densities equal or higher than the half value of the maximum density at each timestep to calculate properties for the `` cloud '' , a choice motivated by the fact that the maximum density in the box is changing substantially during the simulation ( from @xmath28 to @xmath29 cm3 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ longitudes ] we display the evolution of two different characteristic lengths : a ) @xmath30 , the maximum @xmath31-length of the cloud ( solid line ) ; and b ) @xmath32 , the jeans length ( dotted line ) calculated as @xmath33^{1/2 } , \\label{jeans}\\ ] ] where  is the effective polytropic index in the simulations resulting from equilibrium between the heating and cooling rates , @xmath34 is the isothermal speed of sound , and @xmath35 is the mean density of the cloud ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the values of these lengths are denoted on the left - hand side @xmath36-axis .",
    "we also display the evolution of three different energies : a ) the absolute value of the gravitational energy @xmath37 ( short - dashed line ) , where @xmath38 is the density and @xmath39 is the gravitational potential ; b ) the kinetic energy in the frame of the cloud @xmath40 ( long - dashed line ) , where @xmath41 is the velocity field and @xmath42 is the mass - weighted average velocity of the cloud ; and c ) the magnetic energy @xmath43 ( dot - dashed line ) , where @xmath44 is the magnetic field .",
    "note that in all the previous integrals , the volume element is @xmath45 , because of the two - dimensional character of the simulations and thus all the energies considered here are strictly per unit length in the @xmath46-direction .",
    "the values of the energies are denoted in the left - hand side of the @xmath36-axis .",
    "the @xmath31-axis runs from @xmath47 , the timestep when we turned off the star - formation in the simulations , to 15.2  myrs after .    at @xmath47",
    "the jeans length ( dotted line ) is initially larger than the @xmath31-length @xmath30 ( solid line ) ( the difference was larger at earlier times ) .",
    "this comparison suggests that , at least in this direction , the density structure is not formed by gravitational collapse .",
    "we have calculated also the jeans - length for the whole subregion ( not showed here ) , and find that it is again larger than the length of the subregion size .",
    "these results suggest that even if the region must ` feel ' the action of the gravity , it is jeans stable at the beginning , and that the velocity field is mostly the result of the global dynamics of the turbulent flow , not the central gravitational action .    as a result of the overall flow , the ( 2d ) `` filament '' that first appears merges with another structure at @xmath48  8  myr ( see fig .",
    "[ nube_evol ] ) .",
    "this results in the jump in properties seen in fig .",
    "[ nube_evol ] , except for @xmath32 , which depends on intensive quantities : the mean temperature and mean density .",
    "independent of this merging , at this time @xmath49 , suggesting that now the growth of the cloud is also affected by the gravitational field .    concerning the time evolution of the energies ,",
    "it can be seen that the absolute value of the gravitational energy ( long - dashed line ) is higher than the magnetic energy ( dotted - dashed line ) by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "this indicates that the cloud is supercritical by a large margin .",
    "furthermore , it can also be seen that the kinetic energy can not be an agent to stop the collapse : besides being smaller than @xmath50 the velocity field is convergent , implying that it is not working against gravity .",
    "finally , we want to stress that the region called the `` molecular cloud '' ( black isocontour at @xmath51  cm3 in figure  [ nube_evol ] ) appears at roughly the same time in which the region has similar physical and jeans lengths , i.e. , @xmath52 , indicating that the value selected of 35  cm3 is reasonably indicative of the time at which the cloud becomes self - gravitating .    as a corolary of the fact that the velocity field is not due to the gravitational potential of the cloud , self - gravitating clouds like that shown in figure  [ nube_evol ] can therefore be produced by the turbulent velocity field , out of an initially stable medium .",
    "how fast these `` molecular clouds '' can be produced by the general turbulence must depend on how much mass the streams are carrying , how strong the compression is , the rate of cooling of the compressed ( shocked ) region , the geometry of the compression , etc .",
    "for example , the diffuse structure that it is present when we turned off the star formation spends @xmath10  7  myr to become self gravitant .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ nube_evol ] shows that in the simulations , self - gravitating structures of 10 - 20  pc can be coherently formed within a few myr by this mechanism .",
    "since the densities and velocities in the simulations are realistic , this is a plausible mechanism for molecular cloud formation in the ism .      in order to test",
    "how the simulations compare with observations , we construct `` spectra '' for both the densest regions ( @xmath53 , which we call `` molecular cloud '' ) and for the low - density regions ( @xmath54 , which we call `` atomic clouds '' ) .",
    "those spectra are constructed as the mass - weighted velocity ( x - component ) histograms , mimicking the emission of an optically thin line observed from the left hand side of the box , with a spatial resolution of 1.25  pc ( 1  pixel ) , and an ideal telescope . with this approximation",
    ", we are implying that the observed  and h  i line profiles are good representations of the ( mass - weighted ) line of sight - velocity field . also , we are assuming that the  and h  i emission do not coexist , which is not necessarily true .    with those spectra ( mass - weighted velocity histograms )",
    "it is possible to construct a velocity - position diagram , and compare it with the those in fig  [ cutposvel ] .",
    "figure  [ posvel_code ] is the corresponding velocity - position diagram for the cloud and its surrounding medium shown in figure  [ nube_evol]i .",
    "we emphasize several points of similarity between this synthetic position - velocity diagram and the observations ( see figure  [ cutposvel ] ) .",
    "first , the synthetic co emission is always located within a region of strong synthetic h  i emission ; second , there are regions where synthetic h  i emission is present , but where synthetic  emission is not ; third , the maximum of the high - density emission does not necessarily coincide with maximum of the low - density emission ; fourth , the velocity dispersion is higher for the synthetic h  i emission than from the synthetic  emission , and the velocity dispersions of both the low - density and in the high density gas `` emission '' have similar line - widths to those of the observational data .",
    "fifth , both  and h  i line profiles are asymmetric .",
    "finally , as in the case of taurus , the filament is almost coherent in velocity dispersion , i.e. , it has approximately the same velocity dispersion along itself , with values of @xmath102  along 10 - 20 parsecs .",
    "we will discuss this in  [ turbcompresions ] .",
    "it is frequently assumed that the ism is permeated by small - scale non - thermal motions that maintain clouds in a stationary state .",
    "collapse is prevented by those motions , and the role of the external `` intercloud '' medium is only as an agent for ( thermal ) pressure confinement and as a shielding for the uv radiation .",
    "however , the external medium also exerts a dynamical influence on the cloud , compressing and/or disrupting it ( sasao 1973 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . in this sense ,",
    "the fragmented appearance of clouds and the existence of multiple velocity components observed at high velocity resolution suggest that cloud s internal velocity field possesses a disordered or turbulent component at scales comparable with the scales of the clouds .",
    "if molecular clouds are embedded in an intercloud medium of atomic hydrogen ( see series of papers by @xcite and references therein ) , and if the intercloud medium is highly turbulent ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it is plausible that molecular clouds and their surrounding gas are in a dynamical state .",
    "based on refinements of the ism simulations by @xcite , @xcite consider the turbulent pressure at cloud `` boundaries '' .",
    "they show that this boundary pressure is generally anisotropic , which distorts the cloud because the energy involved is generally comparable to the internal cloud kinetic energy . in their picture ,",
    "turbulent motions are not only responsible for cloud support , as is widely accepted : they may also be responsible through large - scale modes of the external turbulence , for shaping and compressing the cloud , possibly even initiating collapse .    in  [ observations ]",
    "we have shown that line - profiles are asymmetric and show important substructure , features which have been increasingly noticed in high spectral and spatial resolution observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these features have been proposed as indicative of large - scale turbulent motions , which may be shaping , distorting and disrupting the cloud ( @xcite ) .    according to the scenario presented here , the observations , which are also reproduced in the simulations ,",
    "may be interpreted as follows .",
    "first , because collisions between h  i streams produce the higher density gas ( and for reasons of shielding ) , there should always be h  i spatially correlated with molecular gas .",
    "second , the larger velocity dispersion of the h  i gas is interpreted as a consequence of its larger spatial extension , and the compression ( shocks ) and consequent kinetic energy dissipation which occurs when the h  i streams collide to form the cloud .",
    "finally , because it is the convergence of macro - turbulent h  i streams that produce the high - density material ( see elmegreen 1996 ) , the h  i line profiles should be asymmetric and frequently shifted in velocity with respect to the molecular gas and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the velocity difference between the streams . on the other hand ,",
    "the line - profile from the compressed region must be a single peaked line at zero velocity .",
    "nevertheless , in a turbulent medium , with density and velocity fluctuations over the some mean density and velocity profiles increasing at the center of the compressed region , the double peaked line - profile might become a single broader line - profile ( with its substructure ) enveloping the narrower line - profile that comes from the compressed region , as its observed from the synthetic line - profiles and as it is suggested from the observed line - profiles . ] .",
    "thus , the breadth and asymmetry of the h  i line profiles indicate a macroscopically - turbulent medium in which clouds exchange mass , momentum and energy with their surroundings .",
    "note that the picture outlined here does not require a coherent or single triggering event in which atomic gas pushes molecular gas together as in a sn explosion .",
    "our scenario is more general , reflecting statistical fluctuations resulting from the combined effects of differing sites .",
    "recognition of these features is not new .",
    "the correspondence between h  i and co in position - velocity diagrams has already been noted by several authors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "andersson ( 1993 and references therein ) , who observed the spatial transition between molecular and atomic gas in 62 edges in 14 clouds , found all five observational features that we described at the end of  [ observations ] and  [ comparison ] .",
    "moriarty - schieven , andersson &  wannier ( 1997 ) suggested that there is morphological evidence that nearby clouds ( l  1457 , see cut 6 in figs .",
    "[ hico ] and [ cutposvel ]  f ) have suffered compressions at scales similar to the scales of the cloud .",
    "these authors proposed an unobserved sn explosion as a possible mechanism of producing this morphology .",
    "however , the observed morphology is hard to reconcile with a single point source of compression , while it is fully consistent with our scenario .",
    "furthermore , the existence of multi - peak , asymmetric line - profiles at all scales ( for larger , see e.g. , @xcite ; for smaller ,",
    "see e.g. , @xcite ) strongly suggests the multi - scale nature of the turbulent motions ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the velocity - dispersion coherence along large structures have already seen before both in low - mass clouds ( taurus , @xcite ) as well as in high mass clouds ( w51 @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important limitations of these simulations is that the cooling laws and the available resolution limit the simulations to densities @xmath57 100 cm3 , so that the evolution of higher - density ( 2 or more ) structures can not be followed .",
    "this is important , because molecular gas probably can not be formed sufficiently rapidly within our density range .",
    "characteristic @xmath58 formation rate on grains are of the order of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the density of atomic hydrogen and @xmath61 , the rate coefficient , has typical values of the order of 3 @xmath0 cm3 seg1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the typical @xmath58 formation timescales are given by @xmath62 thus , at our threshold density of 35 cm3 , the @xmath58 formation timescale is 30 myr , uncomfortably long .",
    "the low values of the density reached in the simulations clouds are consequence of the spatial resolution and the mass diffusion , which smoothes the strong density gradients ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . nevertheless , we envisage that the clouds simulated here would really collapse to structures of much higher density in even shorter times ( for example , at @xmath63  100  cm3 , the free - fall time is approximately 3  myr ) , given the strength of the external flows , if we were to use higher spatial resolution . in this way",
    "our `` molecular gas '' above the threshold density merely indicates the approximate location and velocity of the higher - density material which would be formed within it . in the real interstellar gas",
    ", there is no barrier to compressing gas in the cloud to typical taurus densities of the order of 3 cm3 so that the molecular gas could be produced as rapidly as the dynamical compression occurs .    on the other hand ,",
    "regions that we identify with molecular gas are not really isothermal in the simulations , but this is not a reason for concern , since we are not dealing with the internal structure of these clouds which are at the limit of the resolution anyway .",
    "another limitation of the simulations is that they are two - dimensional calculations which assume no variation of properties perpendicular to the galactic plane . while colliding streams in 2d produce filaments , in 3d they may produce sheets .",
    "nevertheless , the most probable situation in one in which the colliding streams are oblique , such that the region that is compressed is a filament again .",
    "also , inhomogeneities in the physical properties of the streams ( density , temperature , etc . ) and a set of instabilities which are produced when streams are colliding may destroy the possible appareance of the sheet .",
    "furthermore , the structure in 3d simulations is still strongly filamentary ( see e.g. , ostriker et al . 1998 ; padoan &  nordlund 1999 ; mac low 1999 ; pichardo et al .",
    "@xcite discuss other possible differences of 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "thirdly , the energy input into the ism is assumed to be from high mass star formation , which seems to be of little relevance to low - mass star forming regions like taurus .",
    "however , the only role of the energy input in the present situation is to produce large - scale flows and turbulence which in turn produce the `` molecular cloud '' ; since the predicted motions agree quite well with the h  i data , our approach is justified . moreover , since the stellar energy input is turned off to follow cloud formation , disruption by local high - mass stars is not an issue .",
    "it should be emphasized that while we are considering the simulations with a view toward understanding the taurus region , we are not attempting to model the complex in detail , because turbulent flows exhibit a chaotic behavior , i.e. , the time histories of arbitrarily close initial conditions diverge exponentially and end up completely different ( e.g. @xcite ) . instead , they are only expected to statistically reproduce the dynamical relationship between h  i flows and molecular gas in a statistical sense",
    "in this paper we have used h  i and  data to show that the dynamical features observed through taurus can be interpreted as large - scale compressions of the atomic gas producing the molecular gas in timescales of few myr .",
    "also , we followed the evolution of an small piece of 2d numerical mhd simulations to show how large scale turbulence is able to trigger collapse in density structures that originally are jeans stable .",
    "the timescales for doing this also are few myr , suggesting that low - density h  i streams can be compressing and producing the high density regions in taurus .    with this picture in mind , we suggest that the taurus molecular cloud may have formed quite recently ( @xmath10  3  myr ago ) .",
    "this would solve the post t - tauri problem , suggesting that the very few stars with ages between 5 and 10  myr in the region might be field stars .",
    "we also suggest that the general large - scale interstellar turbulence ( in h  i ) is the mechanism responsible for triggering coherent collapse in regions which apparently are dynamically disconnected .    in this paper",
    "we have only considered the timescale of cloud formation , not the timescale of disruption or dissipation . even with a rapid formation time , if clouds live for 10 myr or more , at least some complexes should have pttss .",
    "thus , our investigation only addresses one - half of the more general post - t tauri problem . we intend to explore the rate of cloud disruption and dissipation in a future contribution .",
