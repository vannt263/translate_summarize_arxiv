    "during recent years , quantum entanglement has been found important not only in studying the non - classical behavior of composite systems but also as one essential resource for the engineering and processing of quantum information . nowadays , there are known",
    "various applications that ( would ) greatly benefit from having entangled quantum states available as , for instance , super - dense coding @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , or the use of grover s quantum search algorithm @xcite , to name just a few of them . despite of the recent progress in dealing with composite quantum systems , however , their manipulation and controlled interaction with the environment has remained a challenge for experiment until the present . apart from various other implementations of composite systems , the proof for and",
    "an excellent control about the generation of entanglement has been achieved especially with neutral atoms that are coupled to high - finesse optical cavities @xcite .    from the experimental perspective , there are two basic types of ( atomic ) level configurations utilized to encode and store a single qubit : apart from ( i ) the use of _ optical _ qubit , that simply refers to the two atomic levels separated by a optical transition frequency , one may ( ii ) utilize also the ( so - called ) _ hyperfine _ qubit that is associated with two hyperfine levels of  usually  the electronic ground state of the atom . in neutral atoms ,",
    "these hyperfine levels are typically separated by a microwave frequency and are known to be robust with regard to decoherence effects and external stray fields in contrast to the optical qubits mentioned above . for the hyperfine qubits , therefore , rather long coherence times ( @xmath2 1 s ) have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of microwave techniques have been developed during the last decades in order to initialize , manipulate and detect the state of such hyperfine qubits @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , a hyperfine qubit can not couple directly to a cavity with the resonant mode frequency in the optical domain .",
    "therefore , in order to manipulate the information encoded by the atom , the superposition of the two hyperfine levels must first be transferred coherently to some other two ( electronically ) excited states before the atom enters the cavity , and this information must be brought back in a coherent fashion after the atom exits the cavity . instead of an atomic two - level configuration , we then need to consider a four - level scheme , in which the two hyperfine levels for storing quantum information are associated with two ( additional ) optically excited levels . in order to realize an efficient atom - cavity coupling , moreover , the energy splitting of the two electronically excited levels",
    "should be compatible with the resonant frequency of the cavity . in this way , a coupling between the hyperfine qubit and the optical cavity can be achieved and might open a route towards the implementation of quantum gates via cavity - mediated atom - atom interactions .    the basic idea for the formation of entanglement between two four - level atoms that are coupled to a optical cavity and a external laser beam",
    "have been first suggested by you and co - authors @xcite , which follows the novel cavity - mediated atom - atom interaction regime from ref .",
    "this interaction regime is based on the exchange of a photon between two bi - level atoms that is stimulated by a cavity which is detuned with regard to transition frequencies of the atoms . later in ref .",
    "@xcite , moreover , it was shown experimentally how this effective atom - atom interaction leads to the generation of entanglement between two atoms that cross a detuned microwave cavity . in the theoretical analysis of you",
    ", however , it was assumed that both atoms couple to the same cavity mode via a constant coupling strength being independent on the atomic position inside the cavity mode .",
    "in practice , the atoms cross the cavity one after another being separated by a macroscopic distance .",
    "this separation of the atoms implies that they have different atom - cavity couplings as given by the radiation pattern of the cavity mode standing - wave .",
    "therefore , a more detailed description of the cavity - mediated entanglement formation has to be considered , in which the degree of entanglement between the atoms depends also on the atom - cavity coupling which depends , in turn , on the location of both atoms inside the cavity mode .",
    "such a position - dependent coupling between the atoms and the cavity requires a revision of the previous theoretical analysis and suggests that the degree of entanglement , that is finally obtained , might depend substantially on the details of how the atoms cross the cavity in the course of interaction .    in the present work",
    ", we propose a scheme to generate an entangled state between the hyperfine qubits of two four - level atoms in a @xmath0-type level configuration . in this scheme , the interaction between the atoms is mediated by a optical cavity and a laser beam that acts perpendicularly to the cavity axis . in contrast to the analysis made by you , moreover , we assume ( i ) the atoms to be separated from each other by a macroscopic distance such that _ no direct _ interaction between the atoms occurs and that ( ii ) both atoms interact simultaneously with the same cavity mode and laser field via a position - dependent couplings while passing through the cavity - laser setup .",
    "this scheme leads to an cavity - laser mediated _ effective _ atom - atom interaction , in which the two parameters to control this interaction are the velocity that encodes the atom - cavity interaction time , and the distance between the atoms that encodes the atom - cavity interaction strength . for two atoms being initially prepared in a product state ( of their hyperfine qubits ) ,",
    "we determine those velocities and distances for which the atoms become maximally entangled when passing through the proposed setup .",
    "apart from generating entanglement between the atoms , we also suggest schemes to implement various two - qubit quantum logical gates , such as the i - swap gate , controlled - z gate , and controlled-@xmath1 gate .",
    "all these gates can be implemented within the given framework , and the respective velocity and inter - atomic distance of the atoms are discussed , for which the gate fidelities become maximal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the scheme to entangle the hyperfine qubits of two four - level atoms .",

    "[ fig:1](c ) ] .",
    "before atom @xmath15 enters the cavity , its electronic population is transferred from state @xmath11 to the state @xmath13 by using a pair of slightly off - resonant laser beams which are coupled to the atomic transitions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "such a population transfer is known as the two - photon raman process @xcite that enables one to perform a second - order transition between the states @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , this could be done by utilizing a two phase - locked laser diode @xcite .",
    "below , we shall refer to this population transfer briefly as a raman pulse and will distinguish between the raman pulses ( laser beams ) @xmath5 and @xmath8 in front and behind the cavity [ see fig .  [ fig:1](c ) ] ; also in the temporal diagram from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , these raman pulses are displayed as boxed pink circles .",

    "the same raman pulses are applied also to the atom @xmath16 which follows @xmath15 subsequently with distance @xmath19 .",
    "however , since the second atom enters the set - up in the state @xmath24 , it remains unaffected by the raman pulse @xmath5 and , thus , the two atoms enter the cavity in the product state @xmath25 .    inside the cavity , both atoms @xmath15 and @xmath16 couple via the optical transition @xmath26 ( and @xmath27 , respectively ) to the same cavity mode with the resonant frequency @xmath28 [ see fig .",

    "for the two atoms which move through the cavity with the velocity @xmath20 along the @xmath21 axis , the gaussian profile ( [ coupling ] ) gives rise to the time - dependent atom - cavity couplings @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and where @xmath34 denotes the initial distance between the atoms .",
    "the cavity - mediated atom - atom interaction ( i.e. , without the laser beam @xmath7 ) is based on the stimulated exchange of a _ single _ photon between two atoms prepared in the product state @xmath35 .",
    "this photon exchange can be understood as the emission of a virtual photon into the cavity mode by the atom @xmath16 and the re - absorbtion of the photon by the atom @xmath15 , while both atoms are coupled off - resonantly to the same cavity mode .",

    "the atomic composite state can be manipulated in order to create an energy exchange between @xmath48 and @xmath49 in a similar way as have been suggested by you and coworkers .",

    "the ( pink ) boxed circles , denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath8 , refer to the two ( pairs of ) raman laser beams in front and behind the cavity .",

    "[ fig:3](a ) , for instance , we have shown that the atom - cavity interaction with a position independent atom - cavity coupling , which was suggested in the ref .",

    "[ fig:3](b ) , moreover , it can be seen how sensitive the entanglement depends on variations in these parameters , an important requisite for any experimental realization .",

    "li and coworkers @xcite suggested that the distance between the atoms is an important parameter that can be utilized to control the ( position - dependent ) atom - cavity coupling which implies also the control over the atomic entanglement . instead of using a two - level atomic configuration , however , for the cavities in optical domain it appears more suitable to consider a four - level @xmath0-type level configuration in which the quantum information is stored in the hyperfine levels of the atomic ground state .",
    "such a configuration appears to be essential for the recent experimental attempts @xcite in which atoms are transported coherently inside the cavity by means of a optical lattice trap ( conveyor belt ) .",
    "for such a belt , the inter - atomic distance is given by the wavelength of the ( standing ) optical lattice , while the velocity of the atoms is set by a shift in the frequencies of the counter - propagating laser beams .",
