    "here deposition is equivalent to the spin flip process @xmath67 and _ vice versa _ for evaporation .",
    "according to zero - temperature glauber kinetics , deposition and evaporation events must occur at the same rate for all eligible sites . owing to the above - mentioned fact that there is always exactly one more site available for deposition than for evaporation",
    ", this `` unbiased '' evolution rule leads to a steadily growing interface in which the average number of particles in the deposit grows as @xmath5 .",
    "this particulate description for the interface naturally suggests the generalization to different deposition and evaporation rates . for reasons that will soon become evident , we consider the following three rules :    * equal deposition and evaporation rates",

    ", the interface reaches an equilibrium state . * irreversible deposition with no evaporation events .    physically , rule ( iii )",
    "is equivalent to interface evolution by zero - temperature glauber kinetics in the presence of a magnetic field that favors the majority spin ; the magnitude of the field is irrelevant ( at zero temperature ) as long as it is smaller than a threshold value to ensure the stability of flat interfaces .      the staircase can also be viewed as a geometric representation of the partition of the integer number @xmath4 . this partition is simply the set of @xmath4 boxes in the first quadrant that are arranged in non - increasing order .",
    "such an object is also called a young diagram @xcite .",

    "the asymptotic behavior of young diagrams is also qualitatively simple : after a suitable rescaling , a typical young diagram converges to a _ limiting shape _ ( see @xcite for precise statements and earlier references ) . to compute this shape",
    "one must know the weights of all possible partitions .",
    "for the case where each partition occurs with equal weight @xmath72 ( the uniform measure ) , the corresponding limiting shape is known @xcite , and will be quoted in the next subsection .    for the ising interface ( rule ( i ) in the above list ) , we do not know the weights of each interface configuration @xcite .",
    "we will see that the shape of the ising interface is slightly different from that of young diagrams , implying that the weights are not uniform . on the other hand , if the spin flip event @xmath73 is favored over @xmath67 ( rule ( ii ) ) , then the interface approaches an equilibrium state .",
    "because the state space is sampled more extensively in the equilibrium system , this suggests that the weights for each interface configuration should be more uniform than in the case of rule ( i ) , as borne out in our simulation results below .",
    "we now present a heuristic derivation for the limiting shape that corresponds to the uniform measure .",
    "we follow an argument by shlosman @xcite ; see also @xcite for a similar approach .",

    "thus the wedge geometry corresponds to an initial state in the particle system that consists of a semi - infinite line of particles in the region @xmath196 and empty space for @xmath197 .",
    "basic features of the interface shape can therefore be translated to corresponding properties of the particle density profile .     rotated by @xmath121 and the corresponding particle configuration .",
    "[ csp],scaledwidth=32.0% ]    a possible connection to random matrices is best appreciated for the situation where the ising interface grows irreversibly ( our rule ( i ) ) . in this case , the weight of any interface configuration is the number of ways to grow the final state from the empty diagram @xmath198 by adding squares one at a time , such that a partition is maintained at each step . for each partition @xmath199 of size @xmath200 ,",
    "the number of distinct growth histories is usually denoted @xmath201 @xcite and irreversible interface growth corresponds to finding the limiting shape with the probability measure @xmath202 where @xmath203 @xcite . for the closely related plancherel measure , @xmath204 , the limiting shape is also known @xcite . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simplicity of the plancherel measure stems from a hidden connection to unitary gaussian random matrices ; similarly , the measure ( [ measure ] ) appears to be related to orthogonal gaussian random matrices .",
    "another open question is the limiting shape of an initially large rectangle of down spins in an infinite sea of up spins . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "although the time scale for this object to disappear is known @xcite , the _ shape _ of this object is not .",
    "one might expect that an initial square would evolve to a circular shape .",
    "it has indeed been proved that for curvature - driven growth every smooth closed curve in the plane asymptotically approaches a ( shrinking ) circular shape @xcite .",
    "the situation in three dimensions is much richer because a surface with both concave and convex portions can undergo fission by curvature - driven growth .",
    "the analogous result to grayson s theorem is that any convex domain will ultimately approach a shrinking sphere @xcite . on the other hand , for the ising - glauber model , nothing has been established rigorously .",
    "our analytic and numerical results showed that lattice anisotropy effects persist in the interface dynamics .",
    "thus we expect that a shrinking cluster in the long - time limit will not be isotropic .",
    "moving to three dimensions , it should be worthwhile to investigate the shape of the zero - temperature ising - glauber interface on the cubic lattice when the spins in the positive octant @xmath205 have a different sign than all other spins .",
    "we anticipate that the results will be similar to the limiting shape of the so - called plane partitions . in this latter problem , analytical results recently obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite correspond to the case of the uniform measure .",
    "it would be interesting to study the possible correspondence between these plane partitions and the ising interface .",
    "finally , we can not resist mentioning that the finger shape ( [ finger ] ) is mathematically identical to the saffman - taylor finger in the hele - shaw cell @xcite .",

    "we study the triangular lattice @xcite because , in contrast to the square lattice , it is macroscopically isotropic , and hence one might anticipate that interface dynamics should be described by the intrinsically isotropic tdgl equation .",
    "we will see , however , that this is _ not _ the case .",
    "there are two natural possibilities for a wedge geometry on the triangular lattice : opening angle ( a ) @xmath207 and ( b ) @xmath206 .",
    "the latter case is more amenable to analysis , since energy decreasing spin flips can never occur and the system has the same reversibility as the @xmath208 wedge on the square lattice .",
    "our derivation of the interface shape follows the steps given for the @xmath208 wedge on the square lattice .",
