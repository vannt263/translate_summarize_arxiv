    "we have successfully implemented a numerical algorithm that enable us to analyze unambiguously a simple model , eq.([sysenr ] ) , of tilted ordered media in a non - trivial geometry imposed by experimental observations . using this numerical algorithm and its extensions , we are able to address the long - standing debate with regard to the origin on the cusp - like features observed in domains of langmuir monolayers using an elastic model . within the context of this simple model which addresses only the competition between the bulk elastic energy and the boundary energy , many qualitative features of the experimental observation have been captured .",
    "discrepancies can not be avoided , as the real system is much more complex .",
    "the model we adopted has neglected other effects and interactions that are present in real system , such as dipolar interactions and adjustments in the tilt degree of freedom . a combination of these effects may account for the discrepancies between the experimental data and the theoretical results .",
