    "we believe quarks are constituents of hadrons , but at present we have not found `` free quarks '' yet . at low densities quarks are confined in individual hadrons , we expected that at high energy density nuclear matter undergoes a transition to deconfined `` quark matter '' or `` quark gluon plasma '' , where quarks could move `` freely '' in a volume much larger than that of a single hadron .",

    "it implies that the chemical freeze out and kinetic freeze out maybe occur simultaneously .",
    "( 3)a basic idea for deconfinement is that the vacuum can have two possible states .",
    "the first is the normal vacuum outside the hadrons .",
    "quarks and their gluon fields modify the vacuum in their neighborhood , transforming it into the second state , the `` perturbative '' vacuum , or `` bag '' state , the vacuum inside the hadron .",
    "the inside state of the vacuum has a higher energy per unit volume than the outside vacuum state , the energy difference , b , is often called as bag constant in the bag model .",
    "the current quark mass is about 10 mev for u quark and d quark .",
    "the mass of hadron with light quarks , i.e. the energy of a static spherical bag with radius r , is @xmath51 where v is the volume of the bag and c is a positive constant , which is determined by the number of quarks in the bag and the eigenvalues of energy and zero - point energy @xcite .",
    "determined by @xmath52 , the energy of the bag has a minimum value @xmath53 .",
    "r.d.pisarski gives the temperature dependent bag constant @xmath54 in @xcite .",
    "the field theory at finite temperature also shows the bag constant is temperature dependent @xcite , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the critical temperature . at the critical temperature the difference between the normal vacuum and the perturbative vacuum disappears , and the quarks are deconfinement . near the critical temperature",
    "the difference between the two vacuums is small and thus the mass of hadron is reduced . at the freeze out",
    "condition , the hadrons decouple from each other , the mass of a hadron really has its vacuum value , but as the temperature around it is still high , it has a `` hot vacuum '' value .",
    "a `` free hadron '' in the vacuum is not `` alone '' , the vacuum around it is full of virtual particles . for hadrons with heavy quarks , h. satz use potential at finite temperature to study their properties @xcite .",
    "the detailed expressions for mass shift are different in these approaches , but they have common points .",
    "the hadron mass decreases with the increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the mass shift is also studied in other ways .",
    "r. d. pisarski and f. wilczek @xcite study the restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in a linear @xmath57 model and show that pion mass is stable but under some conditions the mass of @xmath58 could drop to 77 mev . pion is taken as goldstone bosen its mass would be zero , but in the realistic case , pion mass has a small value .",
    "g. e. brown and m. rho studied the chiral restoration in hot and/or dense matter , and showed that the explicit chiral symmetry breaking  that gives masses to the goldstone bosons could be `` rotated away '' in @xcite .",
    "we also use linear @xmath57 model to study the properties of @xmath59 @xcite , we find that if the explicit breaking term is temperature independent pion mass could even increase as temperature does , but the temperature dependent coupling will change the situation . from the above discussions we see the predictions from different models",
    "are quite different",
    ". only the experiments could give judges .",
    "unfortunately we have not found enough evidence @xcite to show that the hadron mass ( and pion mass ) decreases with increasing temperature at present .",
    "it is difficult to measure the hot hadron mass directly as the observer is in low temperature environment , the pion mass returns to the normal value there .",
    "from the view point of bag model , the volume of pion shrinks and obtains the energy from the vacuum ( bag constant ) , thus the pion mass returns to the normal value . in this process",
    ", the inter structure of pion is changed .",
    "such a change will give no influence on the @xmath60 distribution of pion .",
    "we could measure the influence of mass shift , but in some cases the influence could be even washed away by other facts . in our fitting procedures , we only take pion mass as an adjustable parameter to fit the data .",
    "our result seems consistent with the mass reduction picture and previous studies @xcite .",
    "( 4)the correlation function is determined by the momentum distributin at the freeze out temperature in both the original model and the modified model .",
    "the difference of the momentum distributions at the freeze out temperature between these two models are caued different thermal distributions before the freeze out .",
    "( 5)a completely model - independent reconstruction of the emission function s(x , p ) is not possible .",
    "we follow the approach given in refs.@xcite by using simple parametrizations of the emission function .",
    "we adjust the parameters by a comparison to data .",
    "the modified model can reproduce the main features of the one particle spectra and hbt radii simultaneously now .",
    "this model should be further improved , if it is used to describe the azimuthal momentum space anisotropy of particle emission @xcite .",
    "the pion production from resonance is not considered here . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "resonance decay contributions are shown .",
    "thus a detailed calculation including these effects is necessary for us to make the model better .",
    "we will discuss it elsewhere .",
