    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most viable extensions of the standard model ( sm ) for curing the quantum instability of the higgs sector .",
    "susy , however , has a new hierarchy problem concerning the natural scale of the higgsino dirac mass  the @xmath3 problem .",
    "many supersymmetric extensions of sm have been proposed to cure the @xmath3 problem .",
    "although there is no natural solution to this problem in the minimal supersymmetric models , the next - to - minimal susy @xcite solves the @xmath3 problem , but at the expense of inducing large - tension domain walls , which can over - close the universe . among all possible extensions of supersymmetric sm ,",
    "however , the ones that invoke an extra @xmath0 symmetry , which forbids a bare @xmath3 term @xcite , are particularly promising since problems with the generation of tadpoles and axion are automatically avoided . also , extra @xmath0 gauge symmetries , with their associated extra @xmath4 bosons , naturally arise in effective theories coming from breaking of grand unified theories ( guts ) or in superstring compactifications @xcite .",
    "the above two reasons are the major motivations for our paper .",
    "in general , the presence of a @xmath5 boson in the low - energy spectrum generates additional neutral current transitions , which can have important implications for precision tests @xcite or flavor violation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the existing data allow for a light @xmath5 boson with family - dependent couplings @xcite . in a general @xmath2 model",
    ", the hierarchy of the soft masses in the higgs sector leads to different vacua in which the @xmath2 boson can be heavy or light , although the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing is sufficiently small in all cases .",
    "the analysis of erler and langacker @xcite shows that the @xmath2 boson can be as light as @xmath6 with a @xmath1@xmath2 mixing angle of the @xmath7 .",
    "although a low - scale extra @xmath0 symmetry stabilizes the @xmath3 parameter to tev scale , the tree - level higgs potential is far from representing the physical observables with sufficient precision .",
    "in fact , experience from the minimal model shows that there are large corrections to the higgs masses , once the radiative effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "this is also the case with the @xmath5 models , as the partial analysis of the higgs sector shows @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a proper analysis of the collider data concerning the higgs production , it is necessary to compute the higgs masses and couplings at least at the one - loop level .",
    "in fact , this is necessary even for making comparisons or putting constraints on the parameter space using the lep results @xcite .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to work out the neutral higgs boson masses and mixing angles at the one - loop level in supergravity models with an additional @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "a general tree - level analysis of such models can be found in @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the parameters of the model have already been fixed to the tev scale via the one - loop renormalization group equation ( rge ) running from the string scale with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "the low energy mass spectrum and appropriate vacua that naturally suppress the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing angle have already been derived in @xcite for the tree - level higgs potential .",
    "we will further assume that there is no violation of the cp invariance in the higgs sector , which is a simplifying assumption rather than a result following from high  scale model building .",
    "in the next section we review the properties of the tree - level potential . in sec . 3 , we compute the effective potential and derive the higgs mass spectrum at the one - loop level",
    ". we will also briefly comment on the relevance of two - loop effects . in sec . 4 , we present some numerical estimates of the masses and mixing angles for likely values of the parameter values . here , the lower bound set on the lightest higgs mass by lepii is used as a constraint to restrict the values of our parameters .",
    "of course , to improve the bounds on our parameter space and to further restrict the parameter values , we need to consider the higgs production and decay rates .",
    "the dominant channels are the higgs - strahlung ( bjorken ) process , @xmath8 , and the @xmath1 decay into two higgses , @xmath9 . however , we will work out the details of these processes and cross - sections in a separate work . for now , the bounds that we obtain using the lightest higgs mass as a constraint are still valid .",
    "finally , in sec.5 , we conclude the work and discuss its implications for higgs phenomenology .",
    "we first describe the structure of the effective potential at the tree level .",
    "the gauge group is the same as that of the standard model , but with an additional @xmath0 factor , i.e. , @xmath10 , with coupling constants @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the higgs sector contains two higgs doublets @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and one singlet @xmath17 . the matter multiplets are given by left - handed chiral superfields . for specific charge assignments of the chiral superfields with respect to the gauge group ,",
    "we refer the readers to ref .",
    "for our purposes , we only need to know the charges of the higgs fields under the extra @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "we denote the higgs charges by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the superpotential is given by @xmath21 the most important feature of the above superpotential that distinguishes it from either mssm or nmssm , is the absence of a cubic term in @xmath22 and a term proportional to @xmath23 , usually called the @xmath3 term @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariance of the superpotential under the @xmath0 forbids the appearance of such terms .",
    "although a @xmath3 term is absent from the superpotential , an effective @xmath3 parameter is generated by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field @xmath17 .",

    "this can be seen from our graphs by examining the dashed black and red curves .",
    "based on the mssm analysis @xcite , we do not expect the two - loop corrections to add more than a few gevs to this value . that there is an agreement between the above model and mssm",
    "is no surprise , because the above model is just an extension of mssm .",
    "this is in fact a check on the validity of our results .",
    "the above conclusions might be slightly effected when cp - violating effects are taken into account .",
    "however , the inclusion of cp - violating phases coming from @xmath178 and @xmath179 mixes the scalar and pseudoscalar mass - squared matrices .",
    "the resulting mass - squared matrix is a @xmath180 matrix giving four higgs bosons with no definite cp properties .",
    "this requires a different analysis than what we have done in this paper .",
    "we consider cp violation in a separate work .    finally , for phenomenological reasons , it is desirable to know the higgs mixing angles . in fig .",
    "@xmath157(f ) , we have plotted the three higgs mixing angles against @xmath124 .",
    "the derivation of the higgs mixing angles is shown in appendix a , which is already well known . from the graph",
    ", one can see that for smaller values of @xmath124 , the lightest higgs state is dominated by a mixture of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , while its mixing with the singlet stays less than about @xmath183 percent . however , when @xmath124 is larger than about @xmath183 , the lightest state is dominated by @xmath182 , and the total mixing with @xmath181 and @xmath17 stays less than @xmath183 percent .",
    "this result is not surprising because larger @xmath124 implies a larger vev for @xmath182 .",
    "in this work , we studied the one - loop effects on the lightest higgs mass in a minimal supersymmetric model augmented by an abelian @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "we calculated the top and stop / sbottom one - loop effects in the framework of the effective potential approach .",
    "the most important issue concerning the minimal models extended by a @xmath0 factor , is the mixing of the standard model @xmath1 boson with the @xmath5 boson associated with the extra gauge symmetry . in order for such models to be phenomenologically viable",
    ", the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing angle has to be very small , less than a few times @xmath65 .",
    "we used the smallness of the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing angle , together with the lower bound set on the lightest higgs mass , @xmath184 gev , by lepii data @xcite , to constrain our parameter space .",
    "we showed numerically that the one - loop effects due to the top and stop / sbottom quarks are non - negligible .",
    "the radiative corrections to the higgs boson masses and mixing angles are crucial for interpreting and predicting the higgs production and decay rates in upcoming colliders . in linear colliders , for example nlc ,",
    "the main production mechanisms are the bjorken process and pair  production process , each of which requires a precise knowledge of higgs boson masses and their couplings to the gauge bosons .",
    "( for the analysis of these processes at the tree level , see @xmath185 @xcite ) .",
    "the model at hand predicts a larger upper bound on the higgs boson masses than mssm .",
    "therefore , even if the mssm bounds are violated in the near - future colliders , the model at hand , which generates the @xmath3 parameter dynamically , will accommodate larger higgs masses .",
    "we would like to thank d.a .",
    "demir and a. vainshtein for useful discussions .",
