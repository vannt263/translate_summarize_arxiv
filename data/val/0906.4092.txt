    "in the fall of 2008 , many investors and analysts witnessed multiple once - in - a - lifetimeevents in a single week , with disastrous consequences in many cases for the financial health of their portfolios .",
    "the once - in - a - lifetime designation of the events arises from a calculation of the probabilities of events based on normal statistics .",
    "the returns were more than several sigma beyond the expected return , and by normal statistics , thought to be impossible .",
    "the difficulty lies in the use of a normal pdf to describe returns .",
    "it is known that returns have fat tails@xcite , but for mathematical convenience and perhaps force of habit , a normal pdf is often applied .",
    "the celebrated black - scholes formula for pricing european options is based on several assumptions , one of which is that the returns are described by brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the underlying pdf for brownian motion is a normal pdf .    in this paper",
    "we price european options using a log student s @xmath0-distribution .",
    "we call these formulae of the prices of european options gosset formulae , in honour of the author behind the _ nom de plume _ student .",
    "we present evidence that stock returns are fit by a student s _ t_-distribution , in agreement with known results @xcite .",
    "we then demonstrate the fat tailsof the _ t_-distribution .",
    "one of the difficulties with the fat tails is that one of the integrals , which is required to price an option , diverges .",
    "we present two similar approaches to handle successfully the divergence , and hence find a price for the option .",
    "these approaches can be used to price options using pdf s other than the @xmath0-distribution .",
    "however , we restrict our attention to the @xmath0-distribution and compare prices for options using the gosset and black - scholes formulae . in general ,",
    "the gosset formula yields prices for options that are higher than the prices found from the black - scholes formula .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the gosset formula gives greater weight to events in the tails .",
    "the starting point for the pricing of the european options is the arbitrage theorem @xcite .",
    "consider an experiment that returns @xmath1 for a bet of unity on outcome @xmath2 of the @xmath3 possible outcomes @xmath4 of the experiment . in short ,",
    "the arbitrage theorem states that either the mean return as calculated over the probability of the events @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is zero or there is a betting scheme that leads to a sure win .",
    "the betting scheme may allow for negative , zero , and positive bets .",
    "puts and calls allow for negative , zero , and positive bets .",
    "let @xmath2 be @xmath3 disjoint events of which one and only one must occur .",
    "let @xmath6 be the probability of occurrence of event @xmath2 and * _ c _ * @xmath7 be a vector of bets on the @xmath3 outcomes .",
    "the bets @xmath8 may be zero , positive , or negative .",
    "the gain for a wager of @xmath8 on the @xmath9 outcome given that event @xmath4 occurred is @xmath10 .",
    "note that in a typical bet , @xmath11 if @xmath12 ; the player forfeits the wager @xmath8 if event @xmath13 does not occur .",
    "the mean gain for a wager on the @xmath9 event is @xmath14 and is the expectation over the @xmath4 , which is obtained as @xmath15 .",
    "following the example of de finetti @xcite , we recognize the @xmath16 as @xmath3 equations in @xmath3 unknowns @xmath17 . to ensure that no arbitrage exists , the average gain @xmath18 .",
    "this is only possible for arbitrary @xmath8 if @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 , then the @xmath8 can be selected to yield , on average , @xmath21 . thus to ensure no sure win , @xmath22 .",
    "that this condition must hold for all @xmath13 is a statement that there are no lucky numbers or values for assets . in the context of pricing an option on an asset , the events @xmath2 could be the final price of the asset falling in a range .",
    "ross @xcite shows how to price an option using the arbitrage theorem , assuming that the theorem can be generalized to handle functions rather than @xmath3 discrete outcomes .",
    "if the cost of an option is @xmath23 , then by the principle of no - arbitrage and the arbitrage theorem @xmath24 , where the return for a european call option is @xmath25 and the return for a european put option is @xmath26 .",
    "the notation @xmath27 means the maximum value of @xmath28 and 0 , with @xmath29 being the strike price and @xmath30 the value of the asset .",
    "ross @xcite obtains the black - scholes formula by assuming log - normal statistics for the value of the asset and making some assumptions regarding the time value of the option .",
    "it is not necessary to solve the black - scholes partial differential equation to obtain the black - scholes formula for the price of an european option @xcite .",
    "we accept as a starting point that the arbitrage theorem can be generalized from @xmath3 discrete outcomes to hold for functions .",
    "this we consider a reasonable starting point .",
    "the probability functions and values of assets can always be quantized to have @xmath3 discrete ranges .",
    "we price european options assuming log student s _ t_-distributions , the arbitrage theorem , and results from martingale theory .",
    "the results from the martingale theory allow determination of the risk neutral price of the option .",
    "first we demonstrate that the log student s _ t_-distribution is a reasonable distribution to use to price an option .",
    "the fat - tailproperty was one of the earliest observations of asset returns , with published reports dating back to the early 1960 s @xcite . when the black - scholes formula was developed in the early 1970 s the shortcomings of the underlying normal assumption were identified and attempts were made to incorporate kurtosis ,",
    "see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "also in the early 1970 s the student s _ t_-distribution was first used to describe asset returns @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable work since 1974 comparing the _ t_-distribution and other distributions to empirical data to determine which distribution best fits observations , see for example @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the _ t_-distribution has been found to provide realistic fits to observed asset returns ( particularly equities and equity indices ) and in many cases provides better fits than other distributions @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we show fits to the observed frequency of occurence of daily return data for the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) ( left ) and the s&p 500 ( right ) equity indices .",
    "each plot shows the data with a best fit _ t_-distribution and normal distribution .",
    "the _ t_-distribution fits the observed distribution well , particularly in the tails .",
    "we have observed similar quality fits for the _ t_-distribution to frequency of occurence of daily returns for individual equities .",

    "given that there are 21,186 data points for the djia , it is expected , using the best fit @xmath0-distribution , that only 2 returns will fall below -0.26 .",

    "the fat tails of the student s _ t_-distribution are evident .",
    "events that are 10 standard deviations from the true value are expected approximately @xmath56% of the time for the student s _ t_-distribution with a small number of degrees of freedom , but only @xmath57% of the time for a normal pdf .",

    "one possible justification for the use of student s @xmath0-distribution to describe the daily returns for an asset is as follows .",
    "if the returns are assumed to be normally distributed with a given short term variance , the variance is taken to be a random variable that varies slowly in time , and @xmath60 is the pdf for the return at time some time @xmath0 in the future , then @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the pdf for the return given @xmath44 and @xmath63 is the pdf for @xmath44 at time @xmath0",

    "a gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath52 is chi - squared with @xmath64 degrees of freedom @xcite , and a normal distribution with a variance that is chi - squared distributed is a student s @xmath0-distribution .",
    "a student s @xmath0-distribution for the pdf of the daily returns is consistent with the data shown in fig",
    "the variance of a student s @xmath0-distribution is @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath52 tends to infinity , the @xmath0-distribution tends to a standard normal pdf , which has a variance of one .",
    "the @xmath65 enhancement accounts for the range of values that the variance might take .",
    "if it is known that the variance does not change in time ( i.e , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a dirac delta function ) , then the gosset formula presented in this paper reduces to the black - scholes formula . in this respect",
    "the gosset formula extends the black - scholes formula by removing the condition that the variance is constant in time . under this interpretation , the shape parameter @xmath52 is a measure of the belief that the volatility will not change .",
    "a large @xmath52 means that one believes that the volatility will not change in time .",
    "a small @xmath52 means that one believes that there is a broad range of values that the volatility might take . if the volatility is determined as the standard deviation of @xmath3 independent returns that are normally distributed with an unknown variance , then the maximum value of @xmath52 should equal @xmath68 , which is the number of degrees of freedom in a determination of a sample standard deviation .",
    "this maximum value of @xmath69 takes into account the fact that the sample standard deviation is a random variable and has an uncertainty associated with it .",

    "the gosset formula essentially extends the black - scholes formula by removing the constraint that the volatility be constant in time .",
    "student s _ t_-distributions have fat tailsand fit the returns from assets better than a normal pdf .",
    "the difficulty with pricing options using the student s _ t_-distribution is that the fat tails cause one of the integrals , which is needed to price an option , to diverge .",
    "a viable and physically reasonable value for the price of the option can be obtained by either capping the value of the underlying asset or by truncating the distribution .",
    "the value for the cap or where the truncation takes place need not be unrealistic .",
    "the required integral can be evaluated for a confidence level of 99.99% , which implies a price increase of @xmath210 4 000% for realistic parameters ( volatility @xmath230 and shape parameter @xmath114 ) of the student s _ t_-distribution .",
    "an increase of 4 000% in the value of an asset would be phenomenal and perhaps unphysical .",
    "there is little difference in philosophy between the approaches of pricing an option by capping the value of the asset or truncating the pdf .",
    "both approaches reduce the cost of the option .",
    "however , there can be a large difference in the exposure to risk between the two approaches .      capping the value of the asset ensures , by design and with consent , that the risk associated with the value of the option exceeding the value of the cap does not exist . in the cap approach",
    ", it is accepted that the value of the asset might exceed the value of the cap . however , the price of the option is set assuming that the payout will not exceed the value of the cap .",
    "provided that the option writer and buyer agree to this approach , then there is no risk associated with a large increase in value of the asset .",
    "the buyer gives away the right to extreme returns in exchange for a lower price for the option .",
    "if the option writer and buyer do not agree to a cap on the payout , then the approach of capping the value of the asset still holds risk that the value of the asset will exceed the cap value .",
    "for the same critical value and parameters for the pdf , the cap approach offers an increased premium for the risk as compared to the approach of truncation of the pdf .",
    "this is because the cap approach allows for the possibility that the value of the asset will exceed the value of the cap .",
    "the student s _ t_-distribution has an additional parameter ( the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath52 ) as compared to the normal pdf .",
    "this parameter is a statement of the belief about the range of values that the volatility might take at the time that the option expires .",
    "a large value of @xmath52 is a statement that the volatility will change little in time . in the limit",
    "as @xmath52 approaches infinity , the student s @xmath0-distribution approaches the normal distribution and hence the gosset formula for the price of an option becomes the same as the black - scholes formula .",
    "the black - scholes formula is derived on the assumption that the volatility is constant in time and known .",
    "a small value of @xmath52 is a statement that the volatility might take one of a broad range of values .",
    "fits to the djia for returns over 100 years give a value of @xmath231 .",
    "this value of @xmath232 allows for the distribution of volatility that has been observed over the 100 years of returns . in turbulent markets",
    ", it would be wise to use a small value for the number of degrees of freedom and a large confidence level .",
    "a confidence level is required in the pricing of options using a student s @xmath0-distribution . in calm markets",
    ", it might be acceptable to use a large @xmath52 , of order @xmath68 where @xmath3 is the number of independent samples that are used to calculate the volatility , and a smaller confidence level to match the expectations of the future and tolerance to risk .",
    "the flexibility offered by the gosset formulae of choice of approach ( cap or truncate ) , of the number of degrees of freedom to match the fat tails of returns , and of the critical value allow the analyst and investor additional opportunity to use their insight and circumstances to price options .    the approach used to derive the gosset formulae can be adapted to distributions other than the student s _ t_-distribution .",
