    "coherent states can be generated from vacuum by a classical coherent driving described by an interaction hamiltonian linear in the annihilation @xmath0 and creation @xmath1 operators .",
    "coherent states provide a quantum description of classical coherent light waves and their mixtures @xmath2 are therefore considered to be classical because they are described by a positive semi - definite glauber - sudarshan function @xmath3 @xcite , which can be treated as a probability density of wave amplitudes . on the other hand , if @xmath3 can not be interpreted as a probability density , the state becomes non - classical from the point of view of coherence theory .",
    "operationally , non - classical states can not be prepared using only coherent states and passive linear optical elements .",
    "the lowest - order nonlinearity capable of producing non - classical state is described by interaction hamiltonians quadratic in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "such a quadratic nonlinearity can generate non - classical squeezed states whose @xmath3 can not be considered as an ordinary probability distribution . however , the squeezed states can still be described by a positive semi - definite gaussian wigner function @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in analogy to the set of mixtures of coherent states we can introduce a set @xmath5 of all gaussian states and their mixtures , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes a gaussian state , multi - index @xmath8 labels all possible gaussian states , and @xmath9 is a probability density .",
    "all states in @xmath5 possess positive wigner function due to the gaussian nature .",
    "note that , according to hudson theorem , wigner function of any pure non - gaussian state is negative at some points of phase space @xcite and these states are thus highly non - classical . on the other hand , non - gaussian wigner function of a mixed state @xmath10 generally does not imply that the state is highly non - classical as this non - gaussianity might arise solely from a non - gaussian distribution , @xmath11 , of states .",
    "this is an example of a classical non - gaussianity .",
    "in contrast we define _ quantum _ non - gaussian states as all states which do not belong to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the quantum non - gaussian states are highly non - classical because they can not be prepared from thermal or coherent states using only gaussian operations such as squeezing , and classical randomization .",
    "this means that some higher order nonlinearity is necessarily involved in the state preparation . in view of the no - go theorems for entanglement distillation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , and quantum computing @xcite with gaussian states and operations ,",
    "quantum non - gaussian states therefore represent an enabling resource for continuous variable quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to develop reliable techniques for experimental identification of the quantum non - gaussian states . determining whether any given state is non - classical is generally a very challenging task that may require the investigation of an infinite number of conditions @xcite .",
    "moreover , many experiments provide only partial information about the observed state .",
    "fortunately , these difficulties can be overcome by formulating specific criteria that provide a sufficient condition for non - classicality .",
    "any such criterion can unambiguously verify non - classicality of a class of quantum states while for other states the result is inconclusive .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the quantum non - gaussian character can be witnessed simply by determining the probabilities for the occurrence of vacuum and single - photon states @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this criterion allows us to conclusively certify quantum non - gaussian character of a large set of states including those with positive wigner functions .",
    "simultaneously , it can be used to detect the presence of processes with higher than quadratic quantum nonlinearity .",
    "detection techniques typically register either particle - like or wave - like properties of quantum states . in optical settings where",
    "both types of detectors can be employed , a reliable direct measurement of the photon number is possible only for a low number of photons . when determining the photon number probabilities from coincidence measurements with realistic single - photon detectors that only distinguish the presence or absence of photons we need to ensure that non - classical features are not overestimated @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the probabilities @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be estimated indirectly by homodyne tomography @xcite .",
    "a homodyne detector is used to measure rotated quadratures @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the relative phase between a strong coherent local oscillator and a signal beam , and the probabilities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are then reconstructed from the measured data by post - processing .",
    "in addition , coherent displacement or even squeezing can be applied to the experimental data so that we can determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 of a displaced and/or squeezed version of the original state only by data processing without performing these operations physically on the signal mode .",
    "this is a very useful technique that significantly broadens the applicability of the criterion .",
    "highly non - classical character of many states may be masked by a gaussian envelope which can prevent identification of quantum non - gaussian character from the knowledge of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the above technique can remove this gaussian veil and greatly enhance the power of the criterion .    in this paper",
    "we experimentally certify the quantum non - gaussianity of a conditionally generated squeezed single - photon state @xcite whose wigner function is positive at the origin of phase space due to noise .",
    "the state is prepared by conditionally subtracting a single photon from squeezed vacuum state and it is probed with a homodyne detector .",
    "probabilities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are determined by two different estimation methods , namely linear reconstruction based on pattern functions @xcite and nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation @xcite . to optimally witness the quantum non - gaussian character of the measured state",
    "we apply a suitable anti - squeezing operation to the experimental data .",
    "we conclusively prove the quantum non - gaussian character of the prepared state with confidence of @xmath18 standard deviations .",
    "the experimental results are successfully fitted with a standard theoretical model of photon subtraction from squeezed vacuum .",

    "a simple and powerful criterion for practical identification of quantum non - gaussian states has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "this criterion is based on determination of the maximum probability of a single - photon state , @xmath19 , that can be achieved by gaussian states and their mixtures for a fixed probability of vacuum @xmath20 . if @xmath15 exceeds this bound then the state is quantum non - gaussian .",
    "in fact it suffices to maximize @xmath15 over pure squeezed coherent states that form extremal points of @xmath5 .",
    "this optimization yields a parametric description of the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 . the boundary curve ( [ p01ng ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "points lying above this curve can only be obtained for states that do not belong to @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the class of quantum non - gaussian states is much larger than the class of states with negative wigner function .",
    "for example , a mixture of vacuum and single - photon states with a dominant vacuum contribution , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , has a positive wigner function yet it can be shown that it can not be expressed as a mixture of gaussian states for any @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "achievable by gaussian states and their mixtures is plotted as a function of @xmath14 ( solid blue line ) .",

    "due to the convex structure of the set @xmath5 we can construct a witness of the state s quantum non - gaussian character .",

    ". each optimal witness can be represented by a straight line @xmath38 which is tangent to the boundary curve ( [ p01ng ] ) .    in a similar fashion",
    "we can also investigate whether the state is non - classical in the sense that it can not be expressed as a mixture of coherent states @xmath39 . in this case",

    "we are interested in the quantum non - gaussianity of approximate squeezed single - photon states obtained by photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum @xcite . in the ideal case of perfect single - photon subtraction from pure squeezed vacuum",

    "1 we plot the trajectory of points @xmath53 generated by varying the transmittance @xmath52 for a fixed amount of initial squeezing @xmath34 .",
    "we can see that the curve enters the region of gaussian mixtures so for high enough losses we can no longer identify the state as quantum non - gaussian or as non - classical .",
    "there exists a threshold transmittance @xmath54 for which our criterion reveals the quantum non - gaussian character of the state .",

    "the blue solid line and red dashed line have the same meaning as in fig .  1 . ]",
    "since we deal with a squeezed state , we can intuitively expect that a witness based on fock state probabilities will not be optimal .",
    "we can significantly improve the performance of our witness if we first extract the highly non - classical core of the state @xcite by anti - squeezing the state , @xmath60 .",
    "note that the squeezing is a gaussian operation that maps mixtures of gaussian states onto mixtures of gaussian states . therefore",
    ", if @xmath61 is quantum non - gaussian then @xmath10 is also quantum non - gaussian .",
    "equivalently , we can introduce a generalized witness @xmath62 where @xmath63 are diagonal density matrix elements in basis of squeezed fock states @xmath64 .",
    "the anti - squeezing partly compensates for the initial squeezing and makes the state closer to a mixture of single - photon and vacuum states for which the witness ( [ wadef ] ) is very powerful . note that since the lossy channel and squeezing do not commute , @xmath65 , the anti - squeezing of the output mixed state is not fully equivalent to reducing the initial squeezing @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) we plot a typical trajectory of @xmath53 pairs when the anti - squeezing @xmath59 is varied .",

    ". the remaining radiation at 830 nm is removed by a set of dichroic mirrors ( dm ) .",
    "the frequency doubled pulses are used as a pump in a similar crystal ( ppktp2 ) , phase matched for colinear and fully degenerate parametric generation ( opa ) .",
    "it produces a squeezed vacuum with squeezing strength tunable from 0 to 3.5  db .",
    "the generated squeezed light impinges onto an asymmetric beam splitter ( abs ) which reflects @xmath68% of the signal to a single - photon detection setup .",
    "it consists of a narrowband fabry - perot filter ( fp , fwhm@xmath69 nm ) and a single mode fiber ( smf ) that guides the signal to an avalanche photo diode ( apd ) operated in geiger mode ( spcm - aqr-14 , perkin - elmer ) . we estimate the total quantum efficiency of the filtering and subsequent detection process to be approximately 8@xmath701% .",
    "the uncertainty of the efficiency is quite high particularly due to the uncertainty of the detection probability of the apd .",
    "the signal transmitted by the abs is mixed with a local oscillator ( lo ) using polarizing beam splitters ( pbs1 , pbs2 ) and a half - wave plate ( hwp ) , and detected by means of a pair of photo diodes ( s3883 , hamamatsu ) .",

    "since there could be statistical correlations between estimates of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , a proper evaluation of the statistical significance of the observed non - gaussian character requires determination of statistical error of the witness @xmath56 .",
    "this is accomplished by calculating the statistical error for the sampling function @xmath199 as discussed in sec .",

    "in summary , we have experimentally demonstrated the quantum non - gaussian character of a noisy single - photon squeezed state generated by conditional photon subtraction from pulsed squeezed vacuum .",

    "the generalized witness @xmath56 can identify a much broader class of quantum non - gaussian states than the original witness @xmath33 based on the photon number probabilities @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite because optimization over various gaussian operations allows one to suitably match the witness to a given state .",
    "we emphasize that the witness is able to detect the quantum non - gaussian character of states with positive wigner function .",
    "we have shown that the pattern functions represent an efficient method of estimation of the witness @xmath56 from the experimental homodyne data . moreover ,",
    "this approach provides reliable easy - to - calculate estimates of the statistical error bars .",
    "the probability @xmath123 is an overlap of the measured state @xmath10 with squeezed single - photon state .",
    "since this latter state contains only odd fock states in its fock - state expansion , the probability @xmath123 provides a lower bound on the negativity of the wigner function at the origin of phase space . in particular , if @xmath214 for any @xmath59 , then the wigner function is negative at the origin .",
    "the pattern functions derived in the present work thus also provide a useful tool for probing the negativity of the wigner function without the need for a full reconstruction of photon number distribution",
