    "nonlinear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations , arising in continuum physics and especially in compressible fluid dynamics , admit discontinuous solutions containing shock waves that may _ depend on underlying small  scale mechanisms _ such as the coefficients of viscosity , capillarity , hall effect , relaxation , heat conduction , etc .",
    "such small - scale dependent shocks exist for a variety of problems of physical interest , for instance , those modeled by conservative hyperbolic systems with dispersive phenomena ( e.g.  with capillary effects ) and nonconservative hyperbolic systems ( e.g.  for two - phase fluid flows ) , as well as boundary layer problems ( e.g.  with viscosity terms ) . in the past twenty years , it is has been successively recognized that a standard entropy inequality ( after lax , oleinik , kruzkov , and others ) does not suffice for the unique characterization of physically meaningful solutions to such problems , so that _ additional criteria _ are required in order to characterize these small - scale dependent shock waves uniquely .",
    "these criteria are based on the prescription of a _",
    "kinetic relation _ for conservative hyperbolic systems , a _ family of paths _ for nonconservative hyperbolic systems , and an _ admissible boundary set _ for boundary value problems .",
    "although standard finite difference , finite volume and finite element methods have been very successful in computing solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws , including those containing shock waves , these well - established methods are found to be inadequate for the approximation of small - scale dependent shocks . starting with hou and lefloch ( 1994 ) and hayes and lefloch ( 1996 ) ,",
    "this lack of convergence was explained in terms of the equivalent equation associated with discrete schemes through a formal taylor expansion .",
    "the leading terms in the equivalent equation represent the numerical viscosity of the scheme and need not match the physically relevant small  scale mechanisms that have been neglected in the hyperbolic modeling . consequently , standard shock - capturing schemes , in general , fail to converge to physically meaningful solutions .",
    "our purpose here is to review the methods developed in the past twenty years which accurately describe and compute small  scale dependent shocks .",
    "the challenge is , both , to develop the proper theoretical tools for the description of such solutions and to ensure the convergence of numerical methods toward physically meaningful solutions .",
    "we built here on several earlier reviews by lefloch ( 1989 , 1999 , 2002 , 2010 ) and include the most recent developments and material on numerical methods that were not presented until now especially the theory of schemes with well - controlled dissipation ( wcd , in short ) recently developed by the authors .      in one space dimension ,",
    "the classes of hyperbolic systems under review either admit the conservative form eq:109 u_t + f(u)_x = 0 or the nonconservative form eq:111 u_t + a(u ) u_x = 0 , in which the map @xmath0 is the unknown .",
    "in , the given flux @xmath1 is defined on a ( possibly non - connected ) open set @xmath2 and satisfies the following strict hyperbolicity condition : for every @xmath3 , the matrix @xmath4 admits real and distinct eigenvalues @xmath5 and a basis of right - eigenvectors @xmath6 . in , the given matrix - valued field @xmath7 need not be a jacobian matrix and , also , is required to possess real and distinct eigenvalues and a complete set of eigenvectors .",
    "small - scale dependent solutions arise with systems of the form or and it is our objective to present and investigate specific models of interest in physical applications , especially :    * _ strictly hyperbolic systems . _",
    "the simplest example of interest is provided by the scalar conservation law with cubic flux and added second- and third - order terms and is presented in section  [ sec:21 ] below .",
    "more challenging models arise in the dynamics of fluids and nonlinear elastic material with viscosity and capillarity effects ( cf .  section  [ sec:23 ] ) . * _ non - strictly hyperbolic systems . _ in presence of certain phase transition phenomena , the models of fluids and elastic materials fail to be globaly strictly hyperbolic .",
    "furthermore , the system of magnetohydrodynamics with viscosity and hall effects is probably the most challenging model and plays also an essential role in applications , for instance , in the modeling of the solar wind . *",
    "_ nonconservative hyperbolic systems .",
    "_ as will be discussed in section  [ sec:5 ] below , one of the simplest ( yet challenging ) example in the class of nonconservative hyperbolic systems is obtained by coupling two burgers equations , while the most challenging model of interest in the application contains five equations ( or seven equations , if two thermodynamical variables are introduced ) for the evolution of two ( fluid and vapor ) phases of a fluid mixture .",
    "other important models are the multi - layer shallow water system and the lagrangian gas dynamics with internal energy taken as an independent variable .",
    "* _ initial and boundary value problems . _",
    "models of interest include , both , the linearized and nonlinear euler equations with artificial viscosity or physical viscosity .    a ( mathematical ) entropy inequality can be naturally associated with all ( conservative or nonconservative ) systems under consideration , that is , eq:109-ineq u(u)_t + f(u)_x 0 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are refered to as the entropy and entropy - flux , respectively .",
    "however , in constrast with more classical problems arising in fluid dynamics , is often insufficiently discriminating in order to characterize physically meaningful solutions to the initial value problem associated with or .",
    "therefore , additional admissibility criteria are required , as follows :    * _ kinetic relations _ @xmath10 provide a general tool to define nonclassical entropy solutions to strictly hyperbolic systems of conservation laws ( lefloch 1993 , hayes and lefloch 1996 ) and are relevant when the characteristic fields of the systems do not satisfy lax s genuine nonlinearity condition ( lax 1957 , 1973 ) .",
    "they were introduced first for an hyperbolic - elliptic model of phase transitions in solids ( abeyaratne and knowles 1991a , 1991b , truskinovsky 1987 , 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , a kinetic relation for a nonclassical ( undercompressive ) shock in the @xmath11-characteristic family prescribes the right - hand state @xmath12 as a function of the left - hand state @xmath13 . * _ families of paths _",
    "\\mapsto \\varphi(s ; u_- , u_+)$ ] ( dal maso , lefloch , and murat 1990 , 1995 ) provide underlying integration paths which are necessary in order to define generalized jump relations and weak solutions to nonconservative hyperbolic systems .",
    "the paths @xmath14 \\mapsto \\varphi(s ; u_- , u_+)$ ] connect left - hand states @xmath13 to right - hand states @xmath15 and are derived by analyzing the trajectories of traveling solutions , once an augmented model taking higher - order effects into account is selected . * _ admissible boundary sets _",
    "@xmath16 ( dubois and lefloch 1988 ) are required in order to formulate well - posed initial boundary value problems associated with nonlinear hyperbolic systems .",
    "waves propagating in weak solutions may collapse near a boundary and generate a boundary layer connecting a given boundary state @xmath17 with an actual state constrained to lie in a prescribed boundary set @xmath16 .",
    "it is well now recognized ( hou and lefloch 1994 , hayes and lefloch 1996 , lefloch and rohde 2000 , lefloch and mohamadian 2008 , fjordholm and mishra 2012 ) that a finite difference or volume scheme ( leveque 2003 ) may not converge to physically - relevant weak solutions , unless one can ensure a certain _ consistency property with small - scale effects _ , that is , a consistency with the prescribed kinetic relation , family of paths , or admissible boundary set associated with any specific problem under consideration .",
    "it was suggested in lefloch ( 2010 ) to call the numerical methods satisfying this requirement as the schemes with `` controlled dissipation '' and , recent work by the authors ( covering the treatment of shocks with arbitrary strength ) , it was proposed to refer to them as _ schemes with well - controlled dissipation_.    in particular , the role of the _ equivalent equation _ associated with a given finite difference scheme has been emphasized and analyzed .",
    "the leading terms of the equivalent equations for standard finite difference schemes like the lax - friedrichs scheme , for instance , significantly differ from the physically - relevant small - scale mechanisms .",
    "for small - scale dependent shocks , the approximate solutions , say @xmath18 converge ( when the discretization parameter @xmath19 approaches zero ) toward a limit , say @xmath20 , which is _ distinct from the physical solution , _ say @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , standard finite difference or finite volume techniques , in general , lead to the non - convergence property v : = _ h 0 u^h u this holds for a variety of strictly hyperbolic systems , nonconservative hyperbolic systems , and boundary layer problems .    on the other hand , ` schemes with well - controlled dissipation '",
    "are precisely designed to overcome this challenge and are built by analyzing discrete dissipation operators arising in equivalent equations , imposing that the latter should match the small - scale mechanisms in the underlying augmented system , at least to leading order .",
    "it was emphasized by hou and lefloch ( 1994 ) and hayes and lefloch ( 1996 ) that , in fact , the objective need not be to ensure the convergence of the schemes , but rather to control the error term ( in a suitable norm ) @xmath22 in terms of the physical parameters arising in the problem : shock strength , order of accuracy of the scheme , ratio of capillarity over viscosity , etc .    in recent years , extensive studies have demonstrated the relevance of the equivalent equation , as a tool for designing numerical methods for computing small - scale dependent shocks , and have included numerical experiments in physically realistic set - ups .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 is concerned with strictly hyperbolic systems and the discussion of nonclassical undercompressive shocks to such systems , when the associated augmented models contain diffusive and dispersive terms .",
    "then , section  3 discusses the numerical methods adapted to these problems .",
    "next , in section  4 we turn our attention to nonconservative hyperbolic systems .",
    "the boundary value problems are discussed in section  5 and some concluding remarks are made in section  6 .",
    "we consider first the class of _ hyperbolic conservation laws with vanishing diffusion , _ i.e. [ eq:356 ] u^_t + f(u^)_x = ( b(u^ ) u^_x)_x , where @xmath23 is the unknown , the flux @xmath24 is a given smooth function , and the diffusion coefficient @xmath25 is bounded above and below . for any given initial data and , solutions to the initial value problem associated with converge strongly ( when @xmath26 ) toward a limit @xmath27 satisfying the hyperbolic conservation law [ eq:356 - 0 ] u_t + f(u)_x = 0 in the weak sense of distributions .",
    "weak solutions to are not uniquely characterized by their initial data , but must also be constrained to satisfy a certain entropy condition , ensuring that they be achieved as limits of ( oleinik 1963 , kruzkov 1970 , volpert 1967 ) .",
    "more precisely , solutions @xmath28 to satisfy , for every convex function @xmath29 , @xmath30 in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 is refered to as an entropy - entropy flux pair .",
    "hence , @xmath33 satisfies the so - called entropy inequalities [ eq:357 ] u(u)_t + f(u)_x 0 , u  0 .",
    "weak solutions to that satisfy _ all _ inequalities ( i.e for every convex @xmath34 ) are refered to as _ classical entropy solutions .",
    "_ it is also customary to reformulate the entropy condition in the kruzkov form : @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "nonclassical shock waves arise in weak solutions when , both , diffusion and dispersion are included . the simplest model of interest is provided by the _",
    "linear diffusion - dispersion model _ [ eq : cons2 ] u^_t + f(u^)_x = u^_xx + ( ) u^_xxx , which depends upon two parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 refered to as the diffusion and the dispersion coefficients .",
    "this equation was studied first by jacobs , mckinney , and shearer ( 1993 ) , hayes and lefloch ( 1996 , 1997 ) , and bedjaoui and lefloch ( 2002abc , 2004 ) .",
    "importantly , the relative scaling between @xmath37 and @xmath39 determines the limiting behavior of solutions , and we can distinguish between three cases :    * in the _ diffusion - dominant regime _",
    "@xmath40 , the qualitative behavior of solutions to is similar to the behavior of solutions to and , in fact , the limit @xmath41 is then _ independent _ upon @xmath42 , and is a _ classical _ entropy solution characterized by the infinite family of entropy inequalities . * in the _ dispersion - dominant regime _",
    "@xmath43 , high oscillations develop ( as @xmath37 approaches zero ) especially in regions of steep gradients of the solutions and only weak convergence of @xmath28 is observed . the vanishing dispersion method developed by lax and levermore ( 1983 ) for the korteweg - de vries equation",
    "is the relevant theory in this regime , which can not be covered by the techniques under consideration in the present review .",
    "* in the regime of _ balanced diffusion - dispersion , _ corresponding typically to @xmath44 for a fixed @xmath45 , the limit @xmath41 does exist ( in a strong topology ) and only _ mild oscillations _ are observed near shocks , so that the limit is a weak solution to the hyperbolic conservation law .",
    "most importantly , when @xmath46 , the solutions @xmath21 exhibit nonclassical behavior , as they contain undercompressive shocks ( as defined below ) and _ strongly depend _ upon the coefficient @xmath45 .    from now",
    "on , we focus our attention on the `` critical regime '' where the small - scale terms are kept in balance and , for instance , we write as eq:240 u^_t + f(u^)_x = u^_xx + ^2 u^_xxx , in which @xmath45 is a fixed parameter and @xmath26 . for this augmented model",
    ", we easily derive the identity @xmath47 the diffusive contribution decomposes into a non - positive term and a conservative one , while the dispersive contribution is entirely conservative ; hence , formally at least , as @xmath26 we recover the entropy inequality , _ but only _ for the specific entropy function @xmath48 . in other words",
    ", we obtain the _ ( single ) quadratic entropy inequality _",
    "eq:250 ( u^2/2 ) _ t + f(u)_x 0 , f : = u f. in general , no specific sign is available for arbitrary convex entropies ( unlike what we observed in the diffusion - only regime ) .      more generally , we can consider the _ nonlinear diffusion - dispersion model _",
    "eq:129 u^_t + f(u^)_x = ( b(u^ ) u^_x ) _ x + ^2 ( c_1(u^ ) ( c_2(u^ ) u^_x ) _ x ) _ x , where @xmath49 are given smooth and positive functions . for this model ,",
    "the formal limit @xmath50 satisfies the following _ entropy inequality _ determined by the function @xmath51 [ eq : ucc ] & u(u)_t + f(u)_x 0 , + & u ",
    "= c_2 c_1 > 0 , f : = f u. namely , in the entropy variable @xmath52 , the dispersive term takes the form @xmath53 so that any solution to satisfies & u(u^)_t + f(u^)_x = - d^+ c^_x , d^:= b(u ) u(u ) |u_x|^2 , + & c^:= b(u ) u(u ) u_x + ( c_1(u ) u ( c_1(u ) u_x ) _ x - | c_2(u ) u_x|^2 /2 ) .",
    "nonlinear augmented terms also arise in the _ model of thin liquid films _ [ thin ] u^_t + ( u_^2 - u_^3)_x = ( u_^3 u_x^)_x - ^3 ( u_^3 u^_xxx ) _ x with @xmath54 fixed and @xmath26 .",
    "the scaling @xmath55 is natural since the augmented term @xmath56 now involves four derivatives .",
    "the right - hand side describes the effects of surface tension in a thin liquid film moving on a surface and @xmath57 $ ] denotes the normalized thickness of the thin film layer .",
    "the parameters governing the forces and the slope of the surface are represented by the small parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the model can be derived from the so - called lubrication approximation of the navier - stokes equation when two counter - acting forces are taken into account : the gravity is responsible for pulling the film down an inclined plane while a thermal gradient ( i.e.  the surface tension gradient ) pushes the film up the plane .",
    "this model was studied by bertozzi , m \" unch , and shearer ( 2000 ) , bertozzi and shearer ( 2000 ) , as well as by levy and shearer ( 2004 , 2005 ) , lefloch and shearer ( 2004 ) , otto and westdickenberg ( 2005 ) , and lefloch and mohamadian ( 2008 ) .",
    "it was observed by lefloch and shearer ( 2004 ) that the model satisfies the identity @xmath58 so that , in the limit @xmath26 , the following _ log - type entropy inequality _ associated with the thin liquid film model holds : [ eq : ulog ] ( u u - u ) _ t + ( ( u^2 - u^3 ) u - u + u^2 ) _ x 0 .    consider finally the _ generalized camassa - holm model _ [ cama ] u^_t + f(u^)_x = u_xx + ^2 ( u^_txx + 2 u^_x u^_xx + u^ u^_xxx ) , which arises as a simplified shallow water model when wave breaking takes place .",
    "this equation was first investigated by bressan and constantin ( 2007 ) and coclite and karlsen ( 2006 ) .",
    "it was observed by lefloch and mohamadian ( 2008 ) that implies @xmath59 so that the formal limits @xmath50 must satisfy the quadratic entropy inequality , which was already derived for the linear diffusion - dispersion model . although limiting solutions to and look very similar in numerical tests , careful investigation ( lefloch and mohamadian 2008 ) lead to the conclusion that they do not coincide .",
    "consequently , we emphasize that two augmented models obtained by adding vanishing diffusive - dispersive terms to the same hyperbolic conservation laws do not generate the same nonclassical entropy solutions .",
    "in particular , if a numerical scheme is consistent with the quadratic entropy inequality , it need not converge to physically - relevant solutions .",
    "models for the dynamics of fluids and elastic materials ( in one - space variable ) are completely similar and , for definiteness , we present the latter . the evolution of elastic materials undergoing phase transition may be described by the _ nonlinear elasticity model _",

    "the two characteristic fields are genuinely nonlinear in the sense of lax ( 1974 ) if and only if @xmath63 never vanishes , which , however , fails for most materials encountered in applications as convexity is lost at @xmath64 .",

    "material undergoing phase transitions may be described by the model but with a _ non - monotone _ stress - strain function , satisfying [ 888 ] & (w ) > 0 , w ( -1 , w^m ) ( w^m , + ) , + & (w ) < 0 , w ( w^m , w^m ) for some constants @xmath66 . in the",
    "so - called _ unstable phase _",
    "@xmath67 , the model admits two complex ( conjugate ) eigenvalues and is thus elliptic in nature .",
    "the system is hyperbolic in the non - connected set @xmath68 and all solutions of interest for the hyperbolic lie _ outside _ the unstable region .",
    "recall that slemrod ( 1983 , 1989 ) first studied self - similar solutions to the riemann problem ( i.e.  the initial value problem with piecewise constant data ) , while shearer ( 1986 ) introduced an explicit construction of the riemann solutions when @xmath69 .",
    "it is only later that the notion of a kinetic relation for _ subsonic phase boundaries _ was introduced by truskinovsky ( 1987 , 1993 , 1994 ) and abeyaratne and knowles ( 1991a , 1991b ) .",
    "the latter solved the riemann problem for and investigated the existence of traveling wave solutions when @xmath70 is a piecewise linear function .",
    "next , lefloch ( 1993 ) introduced a mathematical formulation of the kinetic relation for and studied the initial value problem within a class of nonclassical entropy solutions with bounded variation and established an existence theory based on glimm s random choice scheme ; therein , the kinetic relation was given an interpretation as the _ entropy dissipation measure .",
    "_ further studies on this problem were then later by corli and sable - tougeron ( 1997ab , 2000 ) .      to the models in section  [ sec:23 ] , we can associate the entropy eee u(v , w ) = & 2 + ( w ) , f(v , w ) = - ( w ) v , + ( w):= & _ 0^w ( s ) ds , which is _ strictly convex _ under the assumption .",
    "namely , for the augmented model , one has @xmath71 so that in the limit one formally obtains the following entropy inequality associated with the phase transition model [ eq:299 ] ( + ( w ) ) _",

    "this model and its augmented version including viscosity and capillarity terms describe the dynamics of complex fluids with hysteresis and is relevant in many applications to phase transition dynamics : solid - solid interfaces , fluid - gas mixtures , etc .",
    "more generally , we can assume an internal energy function @xmath73 and then derive the evolution equations from the action @xmath74    : = \\int_0^t \\int_\\omega \\big(e(w , w_x )                  - { v^2 \\over 2 } \\big ) \\ , dx dt.\\ ] ] namely , by defining the _ total stress _ as @xmath75 from the least action principle we deduce that a critical point of @xmath76 $ ] satisfies @xmath77 if we also include the effect of a ( nonlinear ) viscosity @xmath78 , we arrive at a fully nonlinear phase transition model with viscosity and capillarity : @xmath79 again , the total energy @xmath80 plays the role of a mathematical entropy , and we find @xmath81 and once more , a single entropy inequality is obtained .    in the case that @xmath82 is quadratic in @xmath83 , for some positive capillarity coefficient @xmath84 , we set @xmath85 , and the total stress decomposes as @xmath86 the evolution equations then take the form [ 666 ] & w_t - v_x = 0 , + & v_t - ( w)_x = ( (w ) w_x^2 2 - ( ( w ) w_x ) _",

    "we then obtain @xmath87 which , again , leads to the entropy inequality .",
    "when the viscosity and capillarity are taken to be constants , we recover the previous model and , again , the entropy inequality is identical for both regularizations .",
    "all the models in this section admit shock wave solutions that do satisfy a single entropy inequality in the sense of distributions ( that is , , , , or ) , but fail to satisfy standard entropy conditions ( oleinik , kruzkov , lax , wendroff , etc . ) .",
    "however , these entropy conditions played an essential role in the design of efficient shock - capturing schemes for standard fluid dynamics problems ( leveque 2003 ) .",
    "the new shocks are referred to as as nonclassical shocks and can be checked to be undercompressive , in the sense that they are linearly unstable , since a perturbation passes through them rather than impinging on them ( as is the case of compressive shocks ) .",
    "for this reason , an additional admissibility condition is necessary , which is called a kinetic relation .",
    "it takes the form of an additional jump relation at shock discontinuities .",
    "kinetic relations can be obtained analytically only for the simpler models ( scalar conservation laws with linear diffusion and dispersion , nonlinear elasticity model with linear viscosity and capillarity ) , so numerical approaches are necessary to tackle these problems . in the references",
    "already cited , numerical investigations have established that kinetic functions exist ( and often satisfy certain monotonicity properties ) for a large class of physically relevant models including thin liquid films , generalized camassa - holm , nonlinear phase transitions , van der waals fluids ( for small shocks ) , and magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the methods and techniques to be presented in this paper are also relevant for other classes of problems .",
    "for instance , the buckley - leverett equation for two - phase flows in porous media provides another model of interest for the applications , and was studied hayes and shearer ( 1999 ) and van  duijn , peletier , and pop ( 2007 ) .",
    "there are also other models of great physical interest which , however , have not yet received as much attention . since the hyperbolic flux of these models does admit an inflection point and that dispersive - type effects are important in the modeling of such problems , it is expected that undercompressive shocks shoud occur , at least in certain regimes of applications .",
    "this is the case of the quantum hydrodynamics models ( marcati , jerome ) , phase field models ( caginalp , ratz ) , suliciu - type models ( carboux , frid , suliciu ) , non - local models involving fractional integrals ( kissiling et al . ,",
    "rohde ) discrete molecular models based on potentials ( for instance of lennard - jones type ) ( bohm , dreyer , nt , tv , weinan ) .",
    "the references at the end of this paper .",
    "another rich direction of research where analogue challenges are met is provided by the coupling techniques involving two hyperbolic systems with distinct flux - functions , for which we refer to lefloch ( 1993 ) , seguin and vovelle ( 2003 ) , godlevski and raviart ( 2004 ) , adimurthi , mishra , and gowda ( 2005 ) , godlevski , le thanh , and raviart ( 2005 ) , bachman and vovelle ( 2006 ) , brger and karlsen ( 2008 ) , chalons , raviart , and seguin ( 2008 ) , holden , karlsen , mitrovic , and panov ( 2009 ) , boutin , coquel , and lefloch ( 2011 , 2012 , 2013 ) , and the references cited therein .",

    "furthermore , if some structural conditions on the numerical flux @xmath95 are assumed as in ( tadmor 1987 , 2003 ) , one can show that the scheme in the limit also satisfies a discrete version of the entropy inequality , that is , [ eq : efdm1 ] u(u_i ) + ( g_i+1/2(t ) - g_i-1/2(t ) ) 0 . here ,",

    "a comprehensive description of these schemes and their properties are available in the literature , for instance in the textbook by leveque ( 2003 ) .      as mentioned in the introduction , standard conservative and entropy stable schemes  fail to approximate nonclassical shocks ( and other small - scale dependent solutions ) . as an illustrative example",

    ", the equivalent equation has the typical form [ eq : eqen ] u_t + f(u)_x = ( ( u)u_x)_x + ^2 ( _ 1(u)(_2(u)u_x)_x)_x + ( ^3 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , this equation is of the augmented form with @xmath100 being now the small - scale parameter .",
    "standard schemes often have @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , with @xmath104 being small - scale terms prescribed in the nonlinear physical model like .",
    "as the shocks realized as the @xmath105 limit of ( [ eq:129 ] ) depend explicitly on the expressions of the diffusion and dispersion terms , this difference in the diffusion and dispersion terms between ( [ eq : eqen ] ) and ( [ eq:129 ] ) is the _ crucial _ reason as to why standard schemes fail to correctly approximate small - scale dependent shocks",
    ".      the equivalent equation of the finite difference scheme also suggests a way for modifying the scheme such that the correct small - scale dependent shock waves can be approximated .",
    "following hayes and lefloch ( 1997 , 1998 ) , lefloch and rohde ( 2000 ) , and lefloch and mohamadian ( 2008 ) , the key idea is to design finite difference schemes whose equivalent equation matches , both , the diffusive and the dispersive terms in the augmented model ( for instance ) .",
    "namely , the schemes are designed so that their equivalent equation ( [ eq : eqen ] ) has @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "such schemes are refered to as _ schemes with controlled dissipation_.    in order to now proceed with the derivation of a class of schemes with controlled dissipation , we focus attention on the prototypical example of the scalar conservation law , and we consider nonclassical shocks generated in the limit of balanced vanishing diffusion and dispersion ; cf .  . on the uniform grid presented in the previous subsection and for any integer @xmath109 , we approximate the conservation law ( [ eq:109 ] ) with the following @xmath110-th order consistent finite difference scheme : [ eq : fds2p ] + _ j =- p^j = p _ j",

    "the numerical viscosity and dispersion terms are linear and match the underlying diffusive - dispersive equation with @xmath125 .",
    "hence , the numerical diffusion and dispersion are `` controlled '' in the sense that they match the underlying small - scale terms .",
    "the above schemes approximate small - scale dependent solutions very well .",
    "indeed , let us illustrate their performance for a representative example of the cubic scalar conservation law with vanishing diffusion and dispersion .",

    "the results shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] demonstrate that the proposed scheme with controlled dissipation converges the correct nonclassical shock wave .",

    "tadmor ( 1987 , 2003 ) showed the existence of such entropy conservative fluxes ( consistent with the entropy flux @xmath97 ) and provided a recipe for the construction of entropy stable schemes , which were determined by adding a diffusive part to the entropy conservative flux ( in terms of the entropy variables @xmath131 ) and resulted in a discrete entropy inequality .",

    "solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic systems in the nonconservative form can contain discontinuities such as shock waves and , therefore , an essential mathematical difficulty is to define a suitable notion of weak solutions to such systems .",
    "namely , the nonconservative product @xmath151 in can not be defined in the distributional sense , by integrating by parts , since this term does not have a divergence form .",
    "the theory introduced by dal maso , lefloch , and murat ( 1990 , 1995 ) allows them to define the nonconservative product @xmath152 as a _ bounded measure _ for all functions @xmath21 with bounded variation , provided a _ family of lipschitz continuous paths _",

    "following an idea by lefloch ( 1990 ) , we now explain how the family of paths is derived in applications , from an augmented model associated with a nonlinear hyperbolic system .",
    "observe that the concept of entropy weak solutions , as outlined above , depends on the chosen family of paths .",
    "different families of paths lead to different jump conditions , hence different weak solutions . a priori",

    "then , the correct jump conditions ( corresponding to the physically relevant solutions ) should be consistent with the _ viscous profiles _ , that is , with traveling wave solutions @xmath163 of satisfying @xmath164 a single - shock solution limitdisc u(t , x ) =    u_- , & x < t , + u_+ , & x > t ,    is considered ` admissible ' if @xmath165 ( almost everywhere ) .",

    "this dependence upon the jump conditions ( and thus of the definition of weak solutions ) on the explicit form of the neglected small - scale effects has profound implications on the design of efficient numerical methods , as we already explained it in the case of non - convex conservative problems in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "unlike for systems of conservation laws , where consistency of finite difference ( or finite volume ) schemes was established by lax and wendroff ( 1960 ) by requiring that the schemes has a discrete conservative form , no such requirement is known about discrete schemes for nonconservative systems .",
    "this _ lack of convergence _ of nonconservative schemes was discovered by hou and lefloch ( 1994 ) and turned out to difficult to observe , as the error may be quite small in certain applications ; error estimates were derived therein , which involve the strength of shocks and the order of the schemes between the numerical and the exact solutions .",
    "hou and lefloch s theory was motivated by a work by karni ( 1992 ) , who advocated , and demonstrated a definite advantage of , using nonconservative schemes in certain application to fluid dynamics .",
    "a large literature is now available on the problems and numerical methods presented in this section and we will not be able to present here a fully exhaustive review . for further reading",

    "our main guidelines in order to design efficient and robust numerical methods for small - scale dependent shock waves can be summarized as follows :    * standard finite difference or finite volume schemes fail to properly approximate weak solutions containing small - scale dependent shocks , and a _ well - controlled dissipation _ requirement is necessary . *",
    "this lack of convergence to physically - relevant solutions arises with most nonlinear hyperbolic problems , including : * non - genuinely nonlinear systems ( when dispersive effects are present and may contribute to the dynamics of shocks ) , * nonconservative hyperbolic systems ( since products of discontinuous functions by measures are regularization - dependent ) , and * boundary value problems ( due to the formation of possibly characteristic boundary layers ) . * numerous applications lead to such problems , especially : * the dynamics of viscous - capillary fluids , * the dynamics of two - phase fluids such as liquid - vapor or liquid - solid or solid - solid mixtures .",
    "* the model of magnetohydrodynamics with hall effect incuded , which leads to the most challenging system , on account of lack of genuine nonlinearity , lack of strict hyperbolicity , and presence of dispersive terms .",
    "* although the classes of problems under consideration are quite distinct physical origin , a single source of difficulty was identified here , that is , the importance of properly computing the global effect of small - scale terms .",
    "standard schemes for all these problems fail because the leading terms in the equivalent equation are different from the small - scale mechanisms of the underlying pde .",
    "* schemes with well - controlled dissipation have been developed in the past fifteen years , in order to accurately compute small - scale dependent shock waves .",
    "the key ingredient was to systematically design numerical diffusion operators that lead to the equivalent equation of the scheme matching the small - scale mechanisms of the underlying pde at the leading order .",
    "* as the residual terms of the equivalent equation can become large with increasing shock strength , any scheme of a fixed order of accuracy will fail to converge to the correct solution for very large shocks , and this issue was addressed .",
    "the proper notion of convergence for small - scale dependent shock waves is that the approximate solutions converge in @xmath241 as well as in terms of kinetic relations , as the order @xmath227 of the scheme is increased . *",
    "computing kinetic functions , familes of paths , and admissible boundary sets is very useful in order to investigate the effects of the diffusion / dispersion ratio , regularization , order of accuracy of the schemes , the efficiency of the schemes , as well as to make comparisons between several physical models .",
