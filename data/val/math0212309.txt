    "in a perfect world , a scientist or engineer who wishes to solve a system of polynomial equations arising from some important application would simply pick up a book on algebraic geometry , look through the table of contents , and find a well - explained , provably fast algorithm which solves his or her problem .",
    "( algebraic geometry began 2000 years ago as the study of polynomial equations , did nt it ? )",
    "he or she would then surf the web to download a good ( free ) implementation which would run quickly enough to be useful .",
    "once one stops laughing at how the real world compares , one realizes what is missing : the standard classical algebraic geometry texts ( e.g. , @xcite century algebraic geometry was understanding the * topological * nature of zero sets of polynomials , rather than efficiently approximating the location of these zeros . ] ) rarely contain algorithms and none contains a complexity analysis of any algorithm .",
    "furthermore , one soon learns from experience that the specific structure underlying one s equations is rarely if ever exploited by a general purpose computational algebra package .",
    "considering the ubiquity of polynomial equations in applications such as geometric modelling @xcite , control theory @xcite , cryptography @xcite , radar imaging @xcite , learning theory @xcite , chemistry @xcite , game theory @xcite , and kinematics @xcite ( just to mention a few applications ) , it then becomes clear that we need an algorithmic theory of algebraic geometry that is practical as well as rigourous .",
    "one need only look at the active research in numerical linear algebra ( e.g. , eigenvalue problems for large sparse matrices ) to see how far we are from a completely satisfactory theory for the numerical solution of general systems of multivariate polynomial equations .",
    "more recently , the introduction of algorithmic and combinatorial ideas has invigorated computational algebraic geometry .",
    "here we give an elementary introduction to one recent aspect of computational algebraic geometry : polyhedral methods for solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations .",
    "the buzz - word for the cognicenti is * toric varieties * @xcite .",
    "however , rather than deriving algorithms from toric variety theory as an afterthought , we will begin directly with concrete examples and see how convex geometry naturally arises from solving equations .",
    "simply put , polyhedral methods are a first step toward a new class of algorithms which adapt themselves to the intrinsic nature of the underlying system of equations . for the purposes of this paper , this means that our polynomial equations will be expressed as sums of monomial terms , and the techniques we describe will exploit the combinatorial structure of which monomial terms appear .",
    "suppose one has the following @xmath0 equations in @xmath0 unknowns @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 :    [ 1]@xmath4 + [ 1]@xmath5 + [ 1]@xmath6 ,    where the @xmath7 are any given complex numbers .",
    "one may reasonably guess that such a system of equations , being neither over - determined or under - determined , will have only finitely many roots @xmath8 with probability @xmath9 , for any continuous probability distribution on the coefficient space @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , with probability @xmath9 , the number of roots will always be the same number ( cf .",
    "theorems [ thm : disc ] and [ thm : smoothkush ] of section [ sub : smooth ] ) .",
    "what then is this `` generic '' number of roots ?    noting that the maximum of the sum of the exponents in any summand of the first , second , or third equation is @xmath11 ( i.e.",
    ", our polynomials each have * total degree * @xmath11 ) , a classical theorem of bzout ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ex .  1 ,",
    "198 ) gives us an upper bound of @xmath12 . a slightly more refined variant which uses degrees with respect to different variables ,",
    "the * multi - graded * version of bzout s theorem @xcite , yields a sharper upper bound of @xmath13 .",
    "however , the true generic number of roots is @xmath14 .",
    "this number was calculated by using the correct concept in our setting : the convex hulls is * convex * iff for all @xmath15 , the line segment connecting @xmath1 and @xmath2 is also contained in @xmath16 .",
    "the * convex hull * of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is then simply the smallest convex set containing @xmath16 , and the computational complexity of convex hulls of finite point sets is fairly well - understood @xcite . ] of the exponent vectors ( also known as the * newton polytopes * ) of our polynomials . in this case ,",
    "all our newton polytopes are identical , and the volume ( suitably normalized ) of any one serves as the correct generic number of complex roots .",
    "+   +    the key idea to keep in mind is that the complexity of solving a system of polynomial equations , or even approximating a * single * root , depends strongly on the * total * number of complex roots . since one does not usually know this number a priori , the algorithm one uses ultimately makes implicit use of some upper bound on this number , usually one of the three we just mentioned",
    "so , much as how our preceding comparison of bounds turned out , algorithms which take monomial term structure into account are preferable over those that do not .",
    "@xmath18    a natural question , especially relevant to geometric modelling , then arises : is there an analogous theory for systems of equations expressed in other bases ? in particular , the systems of equations arising from @xmath16-splines are expressed in the so - called bernstein - bezier basis which uses sums of terms like @xmath19 .",
    "the short answer is that an analogous theory for such bases does not yet exist .",
    "however , the philosophies of fewnomial theory @xcite , straight - line programs @xcite , not to mention polyhedral methods @xcite , are bringing us closer to a theory that can efficiently handle such questions .",
    "we now outline the main results we explain in our paper .",
    "the second result below is new , while the first is older .",
    "( related earlier results will be reviewed throughout this paper . )",
    "however , we emphasize that the statement and proof of the first result has been considerably simplified , we provide many more illustrations and examples than what is usually found in the earlier literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and we have made an effort to keep all prerequisites explicit and contained in this paper .",

    "@xmath18    as might be expected , a sharper estimate on the generic number of complex roots comes at a price : the resulting formula is more difficult to evaluate .",

    "theorem 2 is proved in section [ sec : mixed ] as a simple consequence of mixed subdivisions in the plane .",
    "perhaps the best and simplest place to begin to understand the connection between polytopes and polynomials is the special case of * binomial * systems , i.e. , polynomial systems where each polynomial has exactly @xmath58 monomial terms . for such systems",

    "then multiplying and dividing the equations above is easily seen to be equivalent to performing row operations on @xmath66 .",
    "for example , doing a pivot operation to zero out all but the top entry of the first column of @xmath66 is just the computation of the matrix factorization [ .7]@xmath67 , which is in turn equivalent to observing that +    [ cols=\">,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     where @xmath68e\\!=\\![h_{ij}]$ ] is any hermite factorization of @xmath66 . in particular ,",

    "@xmath71    letting @xmath72 , we then easily obtain the following corollary .    given any @xmath73 polynomial system @xmath43 , its * jacobian matrix * is @xmath74[.7]@xmath75 .",

    "+ * proof of theorem 2 : * note that by bernstein s theorem , it suffices to find an algorithm for computing @xmath507 with bit complexity @xmath508 .",
    "the main idea of the proof can then already be visualized in the first mixed subdivision we illustrated : one computes the mixed area of @xmath52 by first efficiently computing the convex hulls of @xmath509 and @xmath510 , and then expressing the sum of the areas of the mixed cells compactly * without * building the entire mixed subdivision .",
    "this is not a contradiction , provided one views the mixed cells in the right way .    more precisely , first recall that the convex hulls of @xmath509 and @xmath510 can be computed within @xmath511 bit operations , via the usual well - known @xmath58-dimensional convex hull algorithms @xcite . in particular , with this much work , we can already assume we know the inner edge normals of @xmath512 and @xmath513 , and the vertices of @xmath460 and @xmath461 in counter - clockwise order .",
    "let us then pick a vertices @xmath514 and @xmath515 such that their angle cones are disjoint . then there is a mixed subdivison ( which we will never calculate explicitly ! ) with exactly @xmath58 non - mixed cells  @xmath466 and @xmath467  and several other mixed cells .",
    "( this is easily seen by picking a lifting function @xmath516 for @xmath460 that is identically zero , and a linear lifting function @xmath517 for @xmath461 that is minimized at @xmath518 and is constant on a line that intersects the angle cones of @xmath519 and @xmath518 only at the origin . )",
    "note then that the union of the mixed cells can be partition into a union of strips . in particular , by construction , there are disjoint contiguous sequences of edges @xmath520 and @xmath521 , with @xmath522 and @xmath523 incident to @xmath80 , for all @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , every mixed cell of @xmath524 is of the form @xmath525 or @xmath526 , and every @xmath527 and @xmath528 is incident to some mixed cell .",
    "the partition into strips then arises as follows : the mixed cells of @xmath524 can be partitioned into lists of one of the following two forms : @xmath529 @xmath530 where @xmath531 ( resp .",
    "@xmath532 ) , @xmath533 , and @xmath534 ( resp .  @xmath535 .",
    "in particular , the union of the mixed cells in any such list is simply the minkowski sum of a continuous portion of the boundary of @xmath461 and an edge of @xmath460 , and its area can thus be expressed as the absolute value of a determinant of differences of vertices of the @xmath465 .",
    "furthermore , each formula can easily be found by a binary search on the sorted edge normals using @xmath536 comparisons .",
    "since there are no more than @xmath537 such strips , the total work we do is bounded above by the specified complexity bound , so our upper bound is proved .    to obtain our lower bound , note that the mixed area of @xmath52 is zero iff [ [ @xmath460 or @xmath461 is a point ] or [ @xmath460 and @xmath461 are parallel line segments ] .",
    "so just knowing whether the mixed area is positive or not amounts to a rank computation on a matrix of size @xmath538 and thus can take no less than @xmath539 bit operations in the worst case @xcite . @xmath71",
    "here we prove the following generalization of theorem [ thm : hardkush ] .",
    "it is at this point that we will use a slightly more high - brow type of toric variety : the toric variety @xmath540 corresponding to a polytope @xmath165 .",
    "in essence , the key properties that we needed from @xmath248 ( that it compactify @xmath86 and have a partition into orbits corresonding to the faces of a polytope ) continue to hold for @xmath540 .",
    "we make this change to avoid technicalities in defining the zero set of @xmath43 in @xmath541 when @xmath43 is mixed .",
    "since @xmath540 is discussed elsewhere in this volume at greater length @xcite , we proceed with the statement of our theorem .",
    "[ thm : hardbernie ] following the notation of theorem [ thm : bernie ] , let @xmath542 , let @xmath543 be the zero set of @xmath43 in @xmath540 , and let @xmath384 be the collection of path - connected components of @xmath543 .",
    "then there is a natural , well - defined positive * intersection multiplicity * @xmath385 such that @xmath386 and @xmath387 if @xmath388 is a non - degenerate root .",
    "let us take the following lifting of @xmath43 : @xmath547 @xmath548 in particular , we see that there will be exactly one mixed cell for @xmath549 and its corresponding initial term system will be @xmath550 the lifted newton polytopes and induced subdivisions appear below .",
    "+      the idea of our proof of bernstein s theorem then mimics our earlier proof of kushnirenko s theorem : our lifting induces a lifted version @xmath551 of @xmath165 and we ll then try to build a map from our lifted zero set to the projective line . to do so , we ll define @xmath552 $ ] and this is illustrated below .",
    "+          in particular , the only portion of the lower hull of @xmath557 ( i.e. , the `` lower portion '' of toric infinity on @xmath558 ) which is touched by zero set of @xmath132 in @xmath558 is the parallelogram facet , and the projection of this facet has area exactly @xmath546 . @xmath18      at this point , we could just use theorem [ thm : bernie ] to get the generic case and proceed with our proof of the degenerate case .",
    "however , let us observe that we could instead use mixed subdivisions to directly obtain theorem [ thm : bernie ] without reducing to the unmixed case .",
    "the proof proceeds exactly like the proof of theorem [ thm : kush ] , except for the following differences :    1 .",
    "we work with @xmath558 instead of @xmath231 , where @xmath559 $ ] .",
    "2 .   the map @xmath358 is essentially the same but is instead defined via the cox coordinate ring @xcite .",
    "3 .   the only portions of toric infinity in @xmath558 that intersect @xmath560 are those corresponding to facets on the lower hull of @xmath557 that project to * mixed cells * of @xmath561 .",
    "4 .   the final count of roots becomes a sum of roots of a collection of * binomial * systems .",
    "theorem 1 ( full version ) _ suppose @xmath43 is any @xmath73 polynomial system with @xmath564 for all @xmath40 and let @xmath47 denote the zero set of @xmath43 in @xmath565 . then the number of connected components of @xmath47 is no more than @xmath566 or @xmath567 , according as @xmath568 or @xmath569 . _    * proof : * let @xmath570 . if @xmath568 then we can simply set @xmath571 and then apply theorem [ thm : hardkush ] , noting that the @xmath572 for all @xmath40 .",

    "once again , by virtue of the fact that @xmath577 contains the non - negative orthant as one of the cones in its normal fan @xcite , we have that our underlying toric variety ( this time , @xmath578 ) has an embedded copy of @xmath565 .",
