    "however , the phase boundary is not yet clear in the plane of temperature - baryon chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "one of the main goals of the beam energy scan ( bes ) program at rhic is to map the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram .",
    "it s expected that the system undergoes a first - order phase transition at high baryon chemical potential and low temperature  @xcite . with decrease of baryon chemical potential and increase of temperature , the first - order phase transition line ends at a critical point , which belongs to the three - dimensional ising universality class  @xcite . at vanishing chemical potential ,",
    "the calculations of lattice qcd have shown it is a crossover  @xcite , see a sketch of the qcd phase diagram in figure 1(a ) .    to map the qcd phase diagram , the high - order cumulants of conserved charges",
    "are proposed as sensitive observable of the second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "they are related to the generalized susceptibilities and can be calculated by lattice qcd near vanishing chemical potential , i.e. , the position of the blue arrow line as showed in figure 1(a ) , where the transition appears as the remnants of a second - order phase transition belonging to the three - dimensional @xmath1 universality class  @xcite . at the critical point of finite chemical potential , the position of the red arrow line as showed in figure 1(a ) , effective models of qcd have also calculated the cumulants of conserved charges  @xcite .",
    "both of them show that non - monotonic fluctuations , e.g. peak structure and oscillation , of generalized susceptibilities are signatures of the critical point  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask if the system crosses the phase boundary at other places , such as the region of the first - order phase transition , e.g. , the black arrow line as shown in figure 1(a ) , how does the behavior of the generalized susceptibilities change ?",
    "a model investigation should be helpful .",

    "its phase boundary in temperature and external field plane is shown in figure 1(b ) .",

    "with increase of the external field , the first - order phase transition weakens and ends at a critical point @xmath3 , which also belongs to the three - dimensional ising universality class  @xcite . beyond the critical point , it is a crossover region",
    ". both transitions of qcd deconfinement and qcd chiral symmetry restoration have the line of first - order phase transition , and end in a second - order endpoint .",
    "the baryon chemical potential just acts as the external field in the potts model .    in this paper",
    ", we will first show the fluctuations of the second to fourth order susceptibilities in the vicinity of the phase transition temperatures at three given external fields of first- , second - order phase transitions and crossover of the potts model , i.e. , cross the phase boundary along the black , red , blue arrow lines of figure 1(b ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the corresponding susceptibilities of the magnetization from the three - dimensional , three - state potts model is firstly derived in section 2 .",
    "the second to the fourth order susceptibilities at different system sizes of external fields of first- , second - order phase transitions and crossover are presented in section 3 .",
    "it is noteworthy that they all exist non - monotonic fluctuations .",
    "the finite - size scaling of the second and fourth order susceptibilities are further analyzed in section 4 .",
    "it shows that the scaling exponents of them change gradually with the external field .",
    "thus it can be used to distinguish the order of the transition .",
    "finally , the summary and conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the three - dimensional three - state potts model is described in terms of spin variable @xmath4 , which is located at sites @xmath5 of a cubic lattice of size @xmath6 .",
    "the partition function of the model is defined by ,    [ partition func ] & z ( , h ) = _ \\{s_i}e^-(e - hm ) . &    where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is normalized external magnetic field . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are energy and magnetization , respectively ,    [ energy ] & e =- j_i , j(s_i , s_j ) ,  m=_i(s_i , s_g ) . &    here @xmath11 is an interaction energy between nearest - neighbour spins @xmath12 . in this work",

    ", we will present and discuss the fluctuations of generalized susceptibilities at various system sizes at three external fields of the first- , second - order phase transitions and crossover of the three - dimensional , three - state potts model .",
    "in the three - dimensional , three - state potts model , we first choose three fixed external fields .",
    "they are located in the region of first- , second - order phase transitions and crossover , respectively .",
    "i.e. , very small external field @xmath19 for the first - order phase transition , @xmath20 for the critical point  @xcite , and @xmath21 for the crossover .",
    "their positions in figure 1(b ) are marked respectively by black , red and blue arrows .",
    "for each external field , we performed simulations for 3 to 6 @xmath22-values . for each pair of couplings",
    "@xmath23 , we generated 50000 independent configurations .",
    "they have been used in a ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting analysis  @xcite to calculate observables at intermediate parameter values . where the simulation is performed by the wolff cluster algorithm  @xcite , and the helical boundary conditions are used . for each case",
    ", we carry out the simulation at various of lattice sizes of @xmath24 from @xmath25 = 40 to 70 .",
    "the second order susceptibility @xmath15 near the phase transition temperature at three external fields , @xmath26 = 0.0005 , 0.000775 , and 0.002 , are presented in figure 2(a ) , 2(b ) and 2(c ) , respectively .",
    "it is shown that at the first- ( figure 2(a ) ) , second - order phase transitions ( figure 2(b ) ) and crossover ( figure 2(c ) ) , @xmath15 all exhibit a peak structure .",
    "as we know , for a first - order phase transition , the susceptibility is a @xmath27-function in an infinite system .",
    "it is divergent at a second - order phase transition .",
    "finite system size makes it to be a finite peak in both types of transitions  @xcite .    with increase of system size , the position of the peak shifts to the higher temperature . in each sub - figure @xmath28",
    "is set by the position of the maximum at the largest system size @xmath29 . in figure 2(a ) , 2(b ) and 2(c ) , they are 0.54979 , 0.549385 , and 0.54769 , respectively .        the difference among figure 2(a ) , 2(b ) and 2(c ) is the height and width of the peak . from figure 2(a ) to 2(c ) , the height of peak decreases but width becomes wider with the increase of the external field . obviously , the peaks in figure 2(a ) and 2(b ) are narrower and sharper than those in figure 2(c ) .",
    "this implies although the structure of @xmath15 is similar in three different phase transition regions , it s more pronounced at the first- and second - order phase transitions than in the crossover region .    in a given sub - figure",
    ", the peak gets higher and sharper with increase of system size .",
    "it is clear that the size dependence becomes weaker and weaker with the increase of the external field , in particular in figure 2(c ) , the peaks at different system sizes are very close to each other .    the third order susceptibility @xmath30 near the phase transition temperature at three external fields , @xmath26 = 0.0005 , 0.000775 , and 0.002 are shown in figure 3(a ) , 3(b ) and 3(c ) , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the basic structure of each curve in three sub - figures is similar .",
    "it oscillates from negative to positive in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature .",
    "the third order susceptibility fluctuates more frequently and violently near the phase transition temperature than that of the second order one .",
    "their dependence on the external field and system size are the same as those of the second order susceptibility .",
    "the fourth order susceptibility @xmath31 is presented in figure 4 . at @xmath32 ( figure 4(a ) ) and @xmath20 ( figure 4(b ) )",
    ", it has two positive peaks at the two sides of the phase transition temperature and between them is a negative valley . while , such structure is not fully shown up at @xmath21 ( figure 4(c ) ) .",
    "it shows again that the fluctuations in the crossover region are more smooth than those at the first- and second - order phase transition regions .",
    "the structure of @xmath31 is more complicated than @xmath30 .        in figure 2 ,",
    "figure 3 , and figure 4 , it is clear that the generic structure of the second , third and fourth order susceptibilities in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature is qualitatively similar at the three external fields .",
    "a peak appears at the second order susceptibility , oscillation and sign change happen at the third and fourth order susceptibilities .",
    "this shows that non - monotonic behavior , or a sign change is not only related to the critical fluctuations , but also the fluctuations at a first - order phase transition and crossover in a system of finite - size .",
    "however , quantitatively , at an external field of crossover , the fluctuation changes with temperature obviously more smooth than that at the first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "moreover , all generalized susceptibilities are much weakly dependent on the system size .",
    "in fact , system - size dependence on the external field becomes weak gradually with the increase of the external field from sub - figure ( a ) to ( c ) in figure 2 , figure 3 , and figure 4 .",
    "it is interesting to see the finite - size scaling behavior of the generalized susceptibilities at the first- , second - order phase transitions and crossover .",
    "as we know , susceptibility ( @xmath15 ) satisfies the finite - size scaling relation at first- and second - order phase transitions . in the former case",
    ", it is determined only by the geometric dimension ( @xmath33 ) of the system , and the height ( @xmath34 ) is proportional to the volume @xmath35  @xcite . while in the latter case , the height is approximately in proportion to a power of @xmath35 , which is determined by the critical exponents . for an analytic crossover ,",
    "the height of the susceptibility is independent of the system size when system size is large enough  @xcite .",
    "the specific expression of @xmath34 to the size @xmath25 can be given as follows ,    [ fss chi2 ] & _ 2^max(l ) l^__2 , &    where the scaling exponent @xmath36 equals to @xmath33 and 0 for a first - order phase transition and crossover , respectively .",
    "for a second - order phase transition , it is usually a fraction between @xmath33 and 0 , which is decided by the universality class .",
    "so along the phase boundary of the three - dimensional , three - state potts model , i.e. , from a first - order phase transition to a second - order one , then to crossover , the scaling exponent keeps decreasing from @xmath33 to 0 .",
    "the logarithm of equation can be expressed as ,    [ ln fss chi2 ] & = _ _ 2 l + c_1 , &    where @xmath37 is a constant .",
    "this is a straight line with respect to @xmath38 , whose slope is just the scaling exponent @xmath36 .",
    "we plot in figure 5(a ) the logarithm @xmath39 as a function of @xmath38 at various system sizes for @xmath19 ( solid black circles ) , 0.000775 ( solid red stars ) , and 0.002 ( solid blue down - triangles )",
    ". it is demonstrated that the same color points are well fitted by a straight line .",

    "although the magnetization @xmath10 loose its meaning as operator being conjugated to the field - like coupling @xmath51 , the exponent @xmath56 of its susceptibility @xmath15 will also be very close to the critical exponent ratio ( @xmath45 ) as that in the three - dimensional ising universality class  @xcite .    at h",

    "i.e. , deeper into the crossover region , the saturation happens at smaller volumes .",
    "so it shows the current system sizes from @xmath58 to @xmath59 is still not large enough for size independent at @xmath21 .    in figure 4",
    ", it is clear that the fourth order susceptibility has a negative minimum near the phase transition temperature , if the finite - size scaling of its depth @xmath60 exists , it could be as follows ,    [ fss chi4 ] & |_4^min(l)| l^__4 . &    here , the scaling exponent @xmath43 should equal to @xmath61 and 0 for a first - order phase transition and crossover , respectively . for a second - order phase transition ,",
    "it is generally between @xmath61 and 0 .",
    "the scaling exponent can also be gotten from the logarithm of equation    [ ln fss chi4 ] & |_4^min| = _ _ 4 l + c_2 , &    where @xmath62 is a constant .    figure 5(c )",
    "shows the logarithm @xmath63 as a function of @xmath38 at various system sizes at @xmath19 ( solid black circles ) , 0.000775 ( solid red stars ) , and 0.002 ( solid blue down - triangles ) . the same color points show similar linear behavior as those in figure 5(a ) .",
    "the slopes of three solid lines ( @xmath43 ) in figure 5(c ) are presented in figure 5(d ) with a black circle , red star and blue down - triangle , respectively .",
