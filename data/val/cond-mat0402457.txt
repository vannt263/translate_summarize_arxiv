    "there is increasing , although controversial , experimental evidence that , in cuprate high - temperature superconductors , a strong coupling between electrons and optical phonons produces observable features in the single - hole spectral function @xmath0 measured by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes).@xcite in attempting to understand the implications of these measurements , the experiments have been previously analyzed in the context of the theory of the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) coupling in a fermi liquid .",
    "however , the observed spectral function exhibits a manifestly non - fermi - liquid frequency and temperature dependence , @xcite so the justification for this mode of analysis is not clear .    in the present paper ,",
    "we compute and analyze the finite - temperature spectral function of a spinful , one - dimensional ( 1d ) luttinger liquid ( ll ) coupled to a dispersionless optical phonon band ( einstein phonon ) .",
    "such a spectral function was computed previously in ref . , but only at @xmath1 and in the absence of both electron - electron ( el - el ) interactions and el - ph backscattering .",
    "the ll is a quantum critical point , so the spectral function is a scaling function , and should be computed at finite temperature ; the zero - temperature spectral function reveals only the high - frequency behavior of the scaling function .",
    "it is also essential to include el - el interactions , as in real materials they are typically much stronger than the el - ph interactions .",
    "moreover , strong el - el interactions make qualitative changes to the `` appearance '' of the spectral function .",
    "the effects of phonon - assisted backward scattering are also important to consider , as we have done below .",
    "our motivation for this study is threefold .",
    "( 1 ) there are a host of interesting quasi-1d materials,@xcite some of which are amenable to arpes studies,@xcite to which this analysis may be directly applicable .",
    "( 2 ) the ll is the theoretically best understood example of a non fermi liquid  just as many aspects of the fermi liquid state are robust , independent of details of material and even dimensionality , we may hope that some features of non - fermi - liquids are similarly generic , at least within classes of non - fermi - liquids . in this case",
    ", the ll may serve as a paradigmatic model for a broader class of systems .",
    "( 3 ) it may be the case that the quasi-2d cuprates have significant , self - organized `` stripe '' structures@xcite which render them locally quasi-1d , in which case it may be possible to directly compare the results obtained here with experiments @xcite in the cuprates and other highly correlated materials.@xcite    let us start with a qualitative summary of the solution of the el - ph problem in a fermi liquid@xcite at zero temperature .",
    "consider the case of an optical phonon with frequency @xmath2 and dimensionless el - ph coupling @xmath3 , which is not too large .",
    "for @xmath4 , the effect of the el - ph coupling on @xmath0 is an @xmath5-independent broadening of the quasiparticle peak . for @xmath6",
    ", the phonons can be integrated out to produce new effective interactions in the fermi liquid : the largest effect is a renormalization of the fermi velocity , @xmath7 , while the most dramatic effect is the weak effective attraction produced between low - energy quasiparticles , which can lead to a superconducting instability of the fermi liquid state .",
    "we have computed the single - hole spectral function for a ll coupled to optical phonons for the case when the el - ph coupling does not produce a spin gap .",
    "we find that the same _ words _ describe the effects of the el - ph coupling as in the fermi liquid case , but the results _ look _ quite different because the unperturbed ll spectral function is not a simple lorentzian .",
    "specifically , if we let @xmath8 represent the set of coupling constants which define the ll ( i.e. the charge and spin velocities @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 , and the corresponding luttinger exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , then our result can be summarized by    a(k , e ) ~\\ {    ll a_ll(k , e ; \\{g } ) + & |e| _ 0 , + a_ll(k , e ; \\{g^ * } ) & |e| _ 0 ,    . [ approx ] and there is a smooth crossover between the two limits when @xmath13 . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the spectral function of the pure ll ( i.e. in the absence of el - ph coupling ) , the ellipsis represents perturbative corrections to the spectral function which can be ignored as long as the el - ph coupling is not too big or if @xmath15 is high enough , and @xmath16 are renormalized coupling constants obtained by integrating out the phonons  we give explicit expressions for these renormalized couplings below .",
    "the principal results of the present paper are eqs .",
    "( [ approx ] ) and ( [ main_result ] ) .",
    "the latter is an analytic expression for the space - time spectral function that interpolates between the two limits in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) , and is shown to be very nearly exact in the exactly solvable case of forward scattering only",
    ". we later generalize it for el - ph couplings that include backscattering interactions .",
    "plots of @xmath17 computed from eq .",
    "( [ main_result ] ) are shown in the figures .",
    "there are several general features of @xmath17 that are worth noting .",
    "( 1 ) as has been previously emphasized , @xcite the spectral weight of the ll is concentrated in a roughly triangular region of the @xmath5-@xmath18 plane ( see fig . [ contour ] ) , reflecting the fractionalized character of the elementary excitations , in contrast to the fermi liquid case in which the spectral weight is concentrated along the line @xmath19 , reflecting the quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "( 2 ) there is a renormalization of the charge ( holon ) velocity produced by the el - ph coupling , such that @xmath20 , which is analogous to the renormalization of @xmath21 in the fermi liquid .",
    "this produces a `` kink '' in the spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "( 3 ) the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath22 is referred to in the arpes literature as the energy distribution curve ( edc ) , while the @xmath22 dependence at fixed @xmath5 is referred to as the momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) ; the extent to which there is a quasiparticle - like peak in the edc of a ll is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath11 . for weakly interacting electrons , @xmath23 , and",
    "the edc exhibits a peak , although this peak contains a power - law tail indicating the absence of fermionic quasiparticles . for strong repulsive interactions that are sufficiently long range , @xmath24 ,",
    "in which case the edc is extremely broad , and can even fail to exhibit any well defined peak near the fermi energy .",
    "in contrast , the structure of the mdc is much less variable,@xcite and remains peaked even for small @xmath11 .",
    "the presence of extremely broad edcs at the same time that the mdcs are narrow is a manifestly non - fermi - liquid feature and a dramatic signature of the ll .",
    "this feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ experiment_edc_vs_mdc ] .    for a model with",
    "purely forward scattering el - ph interactions , and for more general couplings as long as the el - ph backscattering is not too strong , at low energies @xmath11 is increased by the presence of el - ph interactions , i.e. @xmath25 . for the physically relevant case when the bare @xmath26 , this means that features that are situated within @xmath2 of the fermi energy are made sharper ( more peaked ) by the coupling to phonons",
    ". therefore , for @xmath24 , the result has the following similarity with the fermi liquid case : features in @xmath17 appear broader for binding energies above @xmath2 than for binding energies below . in the fermi liquid case ,",

    ", an effort is made to fit the experimental dispersion of the cuprates to the conventional theory of el - ph coupling in a fermi liquid .",

    "thus , it is important to have a clear idea of which features of this function best distinguish a fermi liquid from a non - fermi - liquid .",
    "it has been argued previously @xcite that the most dramatic signature of a ll is the appearance of extremely broad tails in the edc , although peaks in the mdc remain relatively sharp .",
    "( this signature is particularly dramatic when the el - el interactions are strong ; while the same distinction applies _ in principle _ for weak interactions , _ in practice _ the ll is harder to distinguish from a fermi liquid when the couplings are weak . )",
    "we have shown that some of the gross characteristic features of el - ph coupling in a fermi liquid  an apparent kink in the dispersion relations and edcs that are more peaked at @xmath142 compared to @xmath4are also present in a ll with strong el - el repulsion and forward scattering coupling to phonons . for a ll with more general el - ph couplings ,",
    "the kink is still present , but the tendency of the edc to be more peaked for @xmath142 is eliminated by sufficiently strong el - ph backscattering .",

    "<S> we compute the finite - temperature single - particle spectral function of a one - dimensional luttinger liquid coupled to an optical phonon band . the calculation is performed exactly for the case </S>",
    "<S> in which electron - phonon coupling is purely forward scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the results to include backward scattering with a renormalization group treatment . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion contains a change in velocity at the phonon energy , qualitatively similar to the case of electron - phonon coupling in a fermi liquid </S>",
    "<S> . if the backward scattering part of the the electron - phonon interaction is not too strong compared to the forward scattering part , coupling to phonons also produces a pronounced peak in the spectral function at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spectral function is remarkably similar to the angle - resolved photoemission spectra of the high - temperature superconductors , including the apparent presence of `` nodal quasiparticles , '' the presence of a `` kink '' in the dispersion , and the non - fermi - liquid frequency and temperature dependencies . </S>",
    "<S> although a microscopic justification has not been established for treating the electronic dynamics of the cuprates as quasi - one - dimensional , at the very least we take the quality of the comparison as evidence of the non - fermi - liquid character of the measured spectra . </S>"
