    "the large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc , smc ) are the closest undisrupted neighboring dwarf galaxies to our own .",
    "they have four to five times lower metallicities than the milky way ( mw ) , while their gas - to - dust ratio is much higher , forming environments resembling those of the early universe .",
    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) show clear evidence for energetic star formation activity with h  i shells @xcite , @xcite , h  ii regions @xcite , @xcite , and molecular clouds @xcite , @xcite , all linked to ongoing star formation , as it is observed in young stellar systems , the _ stellar associations _ @xcite , @xcite , .",
    "both mcs contain a variety of such stellar systems , the age and imf of which become very important sources of information on their recent star formation .",
    "they provide a rich sample of targets for the comprehensive study of current star formation in low - metallicity environments . considering that the mcs are so close to us ( @xmath1 50 kpc and 60 kpc ) ,",
    "they are indeed ideal laboratories for a detailed study of clustered star formation and the imf in the early universe , and _ hubble _ s contribution is fundamental in such a study .     and @xmath2 ( @xmath3- and @xmath4-equivalent ) of the lmc star - forming region lh  95/n  64 .",
    "this sharp image , presented at the 2006 general assembly of the international astronomical union , reveals a large number of low - mass infant stars coexisting with young massive ones . these observations ,",
    "being the deepest ever taken towards the lmc , allow us to explore the scientific gain that can be achieved for mcs studies using high spatial resolution photometry from _ hubble_. image credit : nasa , esa and d. a. gouliermis ( mpia ) .",
    "acknowledgments : davide de martin ( esa / hubble).[fig - ima ] ]    , @xmath3 cmd of the stars detected with acs / wfc in the region of lh  95/n  64 . these observations , with a detection limit of @xmath5  28.4 mag ( @xmath0  -2.truept  0.5  m ) , reveal a unique sample of @xmath1  2,450 pms stars , easily distinguished as a secondary red sequence , almost parallel to the faint part of the main sequence .",
    "these stars are found to be concentrated in the central part of the association and in surrounding compact clusters , and their spatial distribution is in excellent coincidence with the loci of the brightest ms stars @xcite.[fig - cmd ] ]",
    "stellar associations contain the richest sample of young bright stars in a galaxy .",
    "consequently our knowledge on the young massive stars of the mcs has been collected from photometric and spectroscopic studies of young stellar associations @xcite .",
    "however , the picture of these stellar systems changed when _",
    "hubble _ observations revealed that mcs associations are not mere aggregates of young bright stars alone , but they also host large numbers of faint pms stars @xcite , @xcite . although nearby galactic ob associations are known to be significant hosts of such stars @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , pms studies in the mcs with _",
    "hubble _ were focused only on the surrounding field of the supernova 1987a @xcite , cluster ngc  1850 @xcite , and the star - burst of 30 doradus @xcite , all in the lmc .",
    "however , these studies are limited by crowding , even at the angular resolution facilitated by _ hubble_.    to learn more about low - mass pms stars in the mcs , one has to study less crowded regions like young stellar associations .",
    "indeed , an investigation on the main - sequence imf of the lmc association lh  52 with hst / wfpc2 observations by @xcite revealed @xmath1 500 low - mass candidate pms stars easily distinguishable in the @xmath6 , @xmath3 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , deeper observations with the wide - field channel ( wfc ) of acs of another lmc association ( the star - forming region lh  95/n  64 ) revealed the coexistence of pms stars and early - type stars in such stellar systems ( figure [ fig - ima ] ) .",
    "these one - of - a - kind observations dramatically changed the picture we had for stellar associations in the mcs by revealing a unique rich sample of pms stars in lh  95/n  64 ( figure [ fig - cmd ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of these low - mass members demonstrates the existence of significant substructure ( `` subgroups '' ) , as in the case of galactic ob associations .",
    "this stellar sub - clustering has its origins possibly in short - lived parental molecular clouds within a giant molecular cloud complex .",
    "each of these `` _ pms clusters _ '' in lh  95/n  64 includes a few early - type stars .",
    "such stars have been identified as candidate herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars due to their strong h  emission .",
    "near - ir spectroscopic study with vlt / sinfoni ( eso program 078.d-0200 ) will clarify their nature .",
    ", @xmath7 being the standard deviation of the background surface density .",
    "this map demonstrates the existence of statistically significant concentrations of pms stars outside the main body of the association ngc  346 ( located at the center ) .",
    "such pms clusters are suspected to be the product of sequential star formation triggered by the action of the ob stars in ngc  346 , which shape the southern part , and a supernova , which affects the northern part of the region @xcite .",
    "[ fig - cmap ] ]      a spatial behavior similar to the pms population of lh  95/n  64 is seen in pms stars of the association ngc  346 in the smc @xcite , from observations with acs / wfc .",
    "ngc  346 is located in the brightest h  ii region of the smc , n  66 , and acs uncovered the richness of this region in pms stars @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the surface density map of the region of ngc  346/n  66 constructed from star counts of the pms stars in the observed field is shown in figure [ fig - cmap ] .",
    "apart from the association itself ( seen as the central large concentration ) there are at least five distinct concentrations of pms stars with surface stellar density  -2.truept  3@xmath7 above the background ( where @xmath7 is the standard deviation of the background density ) , which fit the description of `` pms clusters '' .",
    "the size of each cluster is defined by the isopleth corresponding to the local mean density around it , and the time - scale within which each pms cluster was presumably formed is defined by their individual cmds .",
    "although the loci of the pms stars in the cmd exhibit a broadening , which prevents an accurate estimation of their age , it was found that the pms clusters located away from ngc  346 to the north , represent the most recent star formation activity in the region @xcite .    , @xmath3 cmd of all stars detected with acs / wfc imaging in the area of ngc  346 ( 06 around its center ) . pms isochrone models by for ages 0.5 to 15  myr are overplotted to demonstrate that the observed broadening of the pms stars can be easily misinterpreted as an age - spread .",
    "simulations showed that this spread can be explained as the result of interstellar reddening of @xmath8  mag alone , or of two star formation events ( a true age - spread ) @xmath15  myr apart if the reddening is lower .",
    "typical photometric uncertainties in brightness and color are also shown @xcite .",
    "[ fig - pms ] ]      the loci of pms stars in the cmd often show a widening , which could be evidence for an age - spread @xcite .",
    "the low - mass population in subgroups within ob associations of the mw exhibits little evidence for significant age - spreads on time - scales  -2.truept  10  myr @xcite .",
    "although this time - scale is in agreement with a scenario of rapid star formation and cloud dissipation , age differences of the order of 10  myr may be very important for understanding of how sequential star formation proceeds .",
    "moreover , there are several factors apart from age - spread , such as variability and binarity , which can cause considerable deviations of the positions of the pms stars in the cmd @xcite .",
    "a broadening in the cmd is also observed for the pms stars of ngc  346/n  66 ( figure [ fig - pms ] ) .",
    "simulations showed that apart from photometric uncertainties , binarity and variability , reddening seems to play the most important role in the observed widening of the pms stars , providing false evidence for an age - spread if the region suffers from high extinction @xcite .",
    "young stellar systems , which host newborn pms stars , naturally provide the testbed for a comprehensive study of the stellar imf .",
    "a coherent sample of pms stars is found with _ hubble _ from acs imaging in the vicinity of another smc association , ngc  602 , located in the h  ii region n  90 @xcite .",
    "the region of ngc  602/n  90 includes no distinct subgroups , and therefore , being less complicated than ngc  346/n  66 , is more suitable for the investigation of the low - mass imf . for the construction ,",
    "though , of this imf a mass - luminosity relation derived from evolutionary models can not be used due to the spread of the pms stars , also apparent in the cmd of ngc  602 .",
    "instead , counting the pms stars between evolutionary tracks , which represent specific mass ranges , seems to be the most accurate method for the construction of their mass spectrum ( figure [ fig - imf ] ) .    ]",
    "the coexistence of h  ii regions and pms stars in stellar associations of the mcs indicate that star formation may be still active in their vicinity .",
    "indeed , observations with the _ spitzer _ space telescope revealed objects classified as candidate young stellar objects ( ysos ) in such regions @xcite , @xcite , and _ hubble _",
    "s contribution has been very important in disentangling their nature @xcite .",
    "the region of ngc  602/n  90 is also found with _",
    "spitzer _ to host possible ysos , and the comparison of the loci of these ir - bright sources with the _ hubble _ images interestingly showed pms stars to be their optical counterparts @xcite .",
    "a variety of objects is discovered to coincide with these candidate ysos , such as single highly embedded sources , small compact pms clusters , as well as features similar to `` elephant trunks '' , all located at the periphery of ngc  602 , along the dust ridges of the molecular cloud presumably blown - away by the action of the association itself @xcite .",
