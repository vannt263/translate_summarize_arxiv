    "high - dose - rate ( hdr ) brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy in which the tumor is temporarily exposed to a highly radioactive source which dwells at different positions in or around the planning target volume ( ptv ) . for prostate tumors ,",
    "the dwell positions are offered by a temporary transperineal implant of catheters which run through the prostate .",
    "a remote afterloader , which is connected to all the catheters , then sends a radioactive source through the catheters one by one , stopping at several dwell positions inside the ptv .",
    "we assume that the catheter locations and the dwell positions are known .",
    "the goal of the treatment planner is to irradiate the ptv while sparing the surrounding organs at risk ( oars ) by optimizing the dwell time at each dwell position .",
    "traditionally , treatment planning was a forward process , where dwell times were adjusted until the dose distribution was satisfactory . in the last fifteen years",
    ", inverse planning has been developed as a computerized technique where the dwell times are optimized according to the treatment planner s preferences on the dose distribution .    in the remainder of this introduction ,",
    "we explain how dose distributions are evaluated , we provide a literature review on the ongoing progress of inverse planning , and we show how this work contributes to these developments .    _ dvh criteria . _ the dose distribution within the ptv or an oar is described in a dose - volume histogram ( dvh ) .",
    "such a histogram displays the percentage of the structure receiving at least a certain dose .",
    "an example histogram is displayed in figure [ fig : dvhexample ] .",
    "points on this histogram are denoted by @xmath0 or @xmath1 , e.g. , @xmath2 is the minimum dose received in the hottest 10% of the structure under consideration and @xmath3 represents the percentage of the volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose . in a slight deviation from the above notation , @xmath4 is the maximal dose received in the structure .",
    "these statistics are currently the most important quantitative evaluation criteria @xcite .",
    "besides these , the treatment planner inspects the isodose lines in order to avoid undesired hot spots and cold spots .",
    "table [ tab : dvhcriteria ] displays clinically used dvh criteria from a local hospital . in order to achieve tumor control , @xmath3 of the ptv",
    "needs to be at least @xmath5 , i.e. , at least @xmath5 of the ptv s volume need to receive at least @xmath6 of the prescribed dose . the limitation of complications is expressed in dvh constraints on the rectum and urethra .",
    "@xmath7 for the rectum imposes that @xmath5 of the rectum s tissue may not receive more than @xmath8 . a hard upper bound for tissue in the rectum",
    "is set by @xmath9 .",
    "for the urethra , @xmath10 is the upper bound for @xmath5 of the tissue .",
    "the remaining @xmath11 are allowed to reach radiation levels of at most @xmath12 .",
    ".dvh protocol for a prescribed dose of @xmath13 gy for hdr prostate brachytherapy based on @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : datasetdwellpos ]      dopsa has been tested on three patients .",
    "since it is a random local search procedure , the result can be subject to random effects .",
    "therefore , the heuristic has been run 250 times for each patient in order to provide a detailed analysis of the average treatment plan quality and the variation in quality .",
    "if a low variation can be ensured for this optimization algorithm , only a single optimization run per patient will be necessary in a clinical setting to obtain treatment plans with consistent quality .",
    "figures [ fig : sapt2]-[fig : sapt4 ] show the results for all three patient data sets . the average and standard deviation in ptv coverage over 250 replications",
    "are displayed over the running time of 180 seconds .",
    "the positioning of catheters determines the maximally achievable level of @xmath3 in the ptv , which explains the difference in objective values between patients .",
    "the high dependence on catheter positioning is well observable for patient 2 for whom only solutions with @xmath14 can be attained : inspecting the corresponding ultrasound scans reveals badly positioned catheters .    in all three cases",
    ", the ptv coverage increases rapidly within the first 30 seconds and further improvements on the treatment plan quality are achieved over the remaining running time .",
    "every treatment plan determined by dopsa is feasible , i.e. , it always satisfies the dvh criteria imposed on the oars and dwell time constraints ( see constraints - ) .",
    "the absolute standard deviations in ptv coverage after a running time of 3 minutes for each of the 250 replications are 0.09% , 0.33% , and 0.23% , respectively . therefore , dopsa delivers treatment plans with consistent quality across replications .      for the comparison with existing dvh - based optimizers",
    ", we have run an milp solver with the solver settings from @xcite and we have implemented ipip @xcite . the original ipip has been extended by the dtmr to ensure a fair comparison .",
    "these two methods have been run on the same three patient data sets and on the same model .",
    "it is important to recognize that ipip can only provide a single solution per data set , whereas milp and dopsa continue improving the solution .",
    "this is observable in figures [ fig : dvhpt2]-[fig : dvhpt4 ] , where the line for ipip remains flat after a single increase . in theory ,",
    "milp could stop when it proves that the solution is optimal , but this did not happen for any of the patients .",
    "figures [ fig : dvhpt2 ] to [ fig : dvhpt4 ] show the average ptv coverage obtained by dopsa and the coverage obtained by the existing methods milp and ipip .",
    "the running time for patient 3 has been extended to 5 minutes since milp requires more than 3 minutes to find non - zero feasible points .",
    "ipip attains adequate ptv coverage within less than 6 seconds for each patient .",
    "all those solutions are initially superior to treatment plans found by dopsa . over the running time of 3 minutes",
    ", however , dopsa consistently outperforms ipip for all patient data sets . in each of the 250 replications for all three patients , the ptv coverage after",
    "3 minutes is higher for dopsa than for ipip .",
    "the average ptv coverage attained by dopsa exceeds the results by ipip after only 18 , 6 , and 12 seconds , respectively .",
    "milp requires substantially more time to determine good treatment plans . for 2 out of 3 patients",
    ", milp requires more than 1 minute to determine a treatment plan with non - zero ptv coverage .",
    "however , after 3 minutes for patients 1 - 2 and 5 minutes for patient 3 it has found the best plan among the three algorithms .    unfortunately , the optimal objective values are not known .",
    "there is still a large gap between the best solution found by any of the algorithms and the upper bound provided by the milp solver , and this gap does not decrease substantially after running the solver for a week .",
    "dopsa differs greatly from the existing dose - volume based methods while it finds similar objective values .",
    "this could be an indication that much better solutions do not exist .",
    "the significance of the strong performance of dopsa compared to the milp by @xcite becomes apparent when closely investigating the structure of the milp - .",
    "below , we show that the milp is equivalent to the well - known @xmath15-norm minimization , and that an milp solver implicitly uses a method that is known to be effective in approximating the @xmath15-norm .",
    "therefore , we conclude that dopsa displays a remarkable performance by outperforming milp in terms of solution speed .",
    "the objective is to maximize the number of calculation points that receive the prescribed dose of 8.5 gy .",
    "let us first define the vector @xmath16 , indexed by @xmath17 in @xmath18 as follows : @xmath19 since @xmath20 is zero if calculation point @xmath17 receives at least the prescribed dose , minimizing the number of non - zero elements in @xmath16 yields a treatment plan with maximal @xmath3 .",
    "the number of non - zero elements is @xmath21 ( recall that the @xmath15-norm counts the number of non - zero elements in a vector ) . @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath4 can be rewritten similarly .",
    "thus , the lagrangean of the milp - is equivalent to an @xmath15-norm minimization . attaining sparse vectors by minimizing the @xmath15-norm",
    "has been shown to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "an milp solver first solves the following lp relaxation : @xmath22,t\\geq 0}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{i\\in i_{ptv}}x_{i}:(\\dot{d}t)_{i}\\geq 8.5x_{i},(x , t)\\in \\mathcal{x}\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : lprelaxation}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a polyhedron .",
    "substituting @xmath24 yields the following equivalent program : @xmath25,t\\geq 0}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{i\\in i_{ptv}}|y_{i}|:y_{i}\\geq \\tfrac{8.5-(\\dot{d}t)_{i}}{8.5},(1-y , t)\\in \\mathcal{x}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] so , the lp relaxation is equivalent to @xmath26-norm minimization .",
    "literature , predominately in the field of image processing , suggests that an optimal solution for the @xmath26-norm minimization ( linear relaxation of the milp ) provides a good approximation of an optimal solution for the @xmath15-norm minimization ( milp ) : @xcite shows that , in most cases , the @xmath26-approximation is also the sparsest solution for underdetermined systems of equations .",
    "@xcite discusses necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of @xmath15-norm and @xmath26-norm solutions in general .",
    "these conditions do not hold in our case .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite provide numerical evidence for the power of these @xmath26-approximations .",
    "so , when the milp - is solved with an milp solver , the solver implicitly uses an approximation that is known to be accurate .",
    "this explains the results by @xcite , where an milp solver quickly determines good treatment plans .",
    "however , our results in section [ sec : comparison ] show that dopsa still outperforms an milp solver in finding good solutions in a short time - span , which advocates the power of dopsa .",
    "compared to milp - based formulations , dopsa has another advantage .",
    "when more dvh - constraints are added , the time for constraint verifications increases linearly , or sublinearly when solutions are removed in the process .",
    "contrarily , both the number of variables and the number of constraints of the milp formulation grow linearly in the number of dvh criteria , which slows down an milp solver at least quadratically .",
    "for example , when the lp relaxation is solved with an interior point method , the time complexity of solving the kkt system increases at least quadratically in the number of variables . a dual solver can not alleviate this slowdown since the number of constraints increases as well .",
    "the existing dose - volume based optimization methods milp and ipip have not been compared before .",
    "our results show that each method has its own advantages .",
    "ipip is faster while milp determines a better solution .",
    "dopsa , our new algorithm , is a viable alternative to both .",
    "its main advantage is that it does not require a costly solver . the time it takes to determine a good solution is less than milp but slightly more than ipip . since ipip returns a single solution quickly but does not keep improving the solution , dopsa eventually determines better treatment plans .",
    "this leads to two observations : first , advances in computing power will reduce the absolute time difference between both methods , making ipip lose its edge .",
    "second , it is possible to combine the strength of two methods and use the ipip solution as a starting point for dopsa .",
    "however , the additional costs for an lp solver required by ipip and the added complexity is not justified by the slight improvement in solution time .",
    "we have disclosed all information necessary to implement dopsa .",
    "we hope it receives more testing by the community , and will eventually become available to treatment planners .",
