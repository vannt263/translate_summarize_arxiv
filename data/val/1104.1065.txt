    "the structure and elastic properties of carbon nanotubes are studied in connection with the perspectives of their applications in nanoelectronic and nanoelectromechanical devices and composite materials , and are also of fundamental interest , particularly for physics of phase transitions .",
    "for example , superconductivity @xcite , commensurate ",
    "incommensurate phase transition in double - walled nanotubes  @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking with formation of corrugations along nanotube axis  @xcite and structural peierls transition in armchair nanotubes  @xcite have been considered . in the present letter",
    ", we consider a fundamentally new phenomenon related to phase transitions in nanosystems .",
    "in other words , we consider the possibility of inverse orientational melting for molecules encapsulated inside nanotubes caused by structural peierls transition in the nanotubes .",
    "the possibility of peierls transition in carbon nanotubes was first considered in  @xcite . as a result of this transition ,",
    "armchair nanotubes become semiconducting at low temperature , and peierls distortions lead to the kekule structure ( see figure  [ fig:01 ] ) with two essentially different c  c bond lengths and a triple translational period ( three times more hexagons in the translational unit cell ) . in previous studies , the peierls gap  @xcite and the temperature of the transition to the metallic phase with equal c  c bond lengths  @xcite were estimated .",
    "recently , the kekule structure was calculated for the ground state of an infinite armchair ( 5,5 ) nanotube by pm3 semiempirical molecular orbital calculations  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for the ( 5,5 ) nanotube , the difference between c  c bond lengths for semiconducting phase is 0.03   , whereas the difference between nonequivalent c  c bond lengths for metallic phase is only 0.006    @xcite .",
    "note that density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for the ( 5,5 ) nanotube of a finite length  @xcite also gave a 60 atom periodicity of physical properties on the length of nanotube segment which is consistent with kekule structure for infinite armchair nanotubes .",
    "moreover , x - ray crystallographic analysis of chemically synthesized short ( 5,5 ) nanotubes  @xcite shows the kekule bond length alternation pattern , which was in good agreement with dft and pm3 calculations also performed in  @xcite . by the example of the infinite ( 5,5 ) nanotube",
    ", it was demonstrated that the structural peierls transition connected with spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place not only with an increase of temperature , but also can be controlled by uniaxial deformation of armchair nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "a dynamical behaviour of molecules encapsulated inside nanotubes can correspond to the following regimes : oscillations about a fixed position and/or a fixed orientation of the molecule ( regime a ) , hindered motion along the nanotube axis and/or rotation of the molecule ( regime b ) and free motion and/or rotation of the molecule ( regime c ) . in the present letter , we show the possibility of changes of the dynamical behaviour of molecules encapsulated inside armchair nanotubes as a result of the peierls transition in the nanotube structure .",
    "in other words , these changes can include switching between the regimes a and b , switching between the regimes b and c , and the changes in diffusion coefficients corresponding to the hindered motion and/or rotation of the molecule ( regime b ) .",
    "the considered changes are possible in the case where the regime b takes place for at least one phase of the nanotube , i.e. the temperature @xmath1 of the peierls transition should correspond to the temperature range of the regime b ( the hindered motion and/or rotation of the molecule ) . in other words , the temperature @xmath2 should be of the same order of magnitude ( or a few orders of magnitude less ) as energy barriers @xmath3 for motion and/or rotation of the molecule inside the nanotube at this phase . note that inverse melting of motion and/or rotation of the molecule is possible , if the peierls transition from the high- to low - temperature phase of the nanotube occurs with switching from the regime b to the regime c or switching from the regime a to the regime b.    estimations showed that the peierls transition temperature is @xmath4@xmath5  k  @xcite . according to calculations  @xcite , the barriers of the value close to this temperature range were obtained for rotation of the fullerene c@xmath6 inside the c@xmath6@c@xmath7 nanoparticle . it was also found that the changes of bond lengths of the fullerene c@xmath7 , the outer shell of these nanoparticles , within 0.06   lead to an increase of the barriers for rotation by more than an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the changes of the nanotube bond lengths caused by the peierls distortions are of the same order of magnitude ( about 0.02   for the ( 5,5 ) nanotube  @xcite ) .",
    "note also that the size of an encapsulated molecule , and therefore , the nanotube radius can not be too large , since the magnitude of the peierls distortions decreases with an increase of the armchair nanotube radius  @xcite .",
    "thus , taking into account the above considerations , we have chosen the smallest fullerene c@xmath0 and the magnetic endofullerene fe@c@xmath0 to investigate changes in the dynamical behaviour of molecules inside nanotubes at the peierls transition .",
    "it has been shown that the ( 8,8 ) nanotube is the smallest armchair carbon nanotube which can encapsulate the fullerene c@xmath0",
    "a carbon nanotube with the fullerene c@xmath0 inside was also used as a model system to simulate a drug delivery via the nanotube  @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : section 2 presents the dft calculations of the structure of the c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 fullerenes and the pm3 calculations of the structure of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube .",
    "section 3 presents the semiempirical calculations of the barriers for motion and rotation of the fullerenes inside the nanotube .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the dynamical behaviour of molecules inside the nanotubes .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",

    "the semiempirical method of molecular orbitals modified for one - dimensional periodic structures  @xcite with pm3 parameterization  @xcite of the hamiltonian has been used to calculate the structure of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube .",
    "the method was used previously for calculating the kekule structure of the ( 5,5 ) nanotube ground state and for studying structural transitions controlled by uniaxial deformation of this nanotube  @xcite .",
    "the adequacy of the pm3 parameterization of the hamiltonian has been demonstrated  @xcite by the calculation of bond lengths of the c@xmath6 fullerene with @xmath10 symmetry : the calculated values of the bond lengths agree with the measured ones  @xcite at the level of experimental accuracy of @xmath11   .",
    "the calculated kekule structure of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube ground state is shown in figure  [ fig:01 ] .",
    "the difference between the lengths of short and long bonds of this kekule structure of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube is close to such a difference of the ( 5,5 ) nanotube  @xcite .",
    "the peierls distortions include also radial distortions of the armchair carbon nanotube with periodicity of half of the translational period of the nanotube ( for details see  @xcite ) . in the case of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube ,",
    "the longest nanotube radius is 0.547  nm , while the shortest radius is 0.544  nm .",
    "the structures of the fullerenes c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 obtained in section 2 have been used for finding the ground state position and for studying motion and rotation of these fullerenes inside the ( 8,8 ) nanotube .",
    "two structures of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube have been considered : the kekule structure calculated in section 2 , and the structure with all equal bonds 1.423   in length ( so that to be equal to the average bond length of the calculated the kekule structure ) .",
    "the calculations of the interaction energy between walls of double - walled carbon nanotubes showed that the barriers for motion of the short wall relative to the long wall are very sensitive to the length of the long wall  @xcite .",
    "thus , the size of the system is too large for _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the analogous problem exists also for the considered case of a single fullerene inside a nanotube .",
    "therefore , the interaction between carbon atoms of the fullerenes and the nanotube at the interatomic distance @xmath12 is described by the lennard - jones 126 potential        @xmath13    with the parameters @xmath14  mev , @xmath15   .",
    "these parameters of the lennard - jones potential for the fullerene ",
    "nanotube interaction are obtained as the average values of the parameters  @xcite for fullerene  fullerene and fullerene  graphene interactions , in accordance with the procedure described in  @xcite . here , the lennard - jones potential is used for calculating the potential surface of the interaction energy @xmath16 between the fullerene and the infinite nanotube , and we believe that this gives adequate qualitative characteristics of the potential surface shape .",
    "the cut - off distance , @xmath17 of the lennard - jones potential is taken equal to @xmath1815   .",
    "for this cut - off distance the errors of calculation of the interaction energy @xmath16 between the fullerenes and the ( 8,8 ) nanotube and the barriers for relative motion and rotation of the fullerenes inside the nanotube are less than 0.1% .",
    "both the fullerenes and the nanotube are considered to be rigid .",
    "an account of structure deformation is not essential for the shape of the potential surface both for the interwall interaction of carbon nanotubes  @xcite and the intershell interaction of carbon nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "for example , the account of the structure deformation of the shells of c@xmath6@c@xmath7 nanoparticle gives rise to changes of the barriers for relative rotation of the shells which are less than 1%  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the symmetry of interaction energy as a function of coordinates describing relative positions of interacting objects is determined unambiguously by symmetries of the isolated objects and does not change if the symmetries of the objects are broken because of their interactions .",
    "the ground state interaction energies between the c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 fullerenes , and the ( 8,8 ) nanotube with kekule structure are found to be @xmath191.596 and @xmath191.598  ev , respectively . the angles between the @xmath20 symmetry axes of the c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 fullerenes and the nanotube axis at the ground states are 49.6@xmath21 and 53.1@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the metastable states with the @xmath20 symmetry axes of the fullerenes perpendicular to the nanotube axis are also found for both c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 . at the metastable states , the interaction energies are greater by 4.58 and 3.04 mev than the ground state energies , for c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the potential surfaces of the interaction energy between the c@xmath0 fullerene and the nanotube , @xmath22 , as functions of the relative displacement of the fullerene along the axis of the nanotube @xmath23 and the angle of relative rotation of the fullerene about the axis of the nanotube @xmath24 are presented in figure  [ fig:03 ] for both the considered structures of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube . in the general case ,",
    "diffusion of a fullerene along the nanotube axis is accompanied by rotation of the fullerene .",
    "our calculations show that the barriers for rotation of both fullerenes about the axes which are perpendicular to the nanotube axis lie between 3 and 23  mev for any orientation of the fullerene and for both the considered structures of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube .",
    "these barriers are significantly greater than the barriers for rotation of the fullerenes about the axis of the nanotube ( shown in figure  [ fig:03 ] for the c@xmath0 fullerene ) .",
    "therefore , diffusion of the fullerenes along the nanotube axis is accompanied only by rotation about the nanotube axis .",
    "thus , the minimal barrier @xmath25 for diffusion of the fullerenes along the nanotube axis is the barrier between adjacent minima of the potential surface @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fig:03 ] shows that the shapes of the potential surface @xmath22 , corresponding to the kekule structure of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube and to the structure of metallic phase are essentially different . for a case of the structure corresponding to the metallic phase of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube , all the barriers between adjacent minima of the potential surface @xmath22 are equivalent . in this case , the same barrier @xmath26 should be overcome for diffusion of the fullerenes along the nanotube axis and for rotation of the fullerenes about this axis ( see figure  [ fig:03]b ) . for a case of the kekule structure ,",
    "two different barriers between the adjacent minima exist : the barrier @xmath25 for diffusion of the fullerenes along the nanotube axis , and the barrier @xmath27 to rotation of the fullerenes about this axis ( see figure  [ fig:03]a ) . for the fe@c@xmath0 fullerene , the shapes of the potential surfaces @xmath28 are qualitatively the same as for c@xmath0 for both the considered structures of the nanotube .",
    "the calculated values of the barriers @xmath25 and @xmath27 are listed in table [ table1 ] for both fullerenes .",
    "the dependences of the interaction energy between the c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 fullerenes and the nanotube on the relative displacement of the fullerene along the axis of the nanotube and the angle of its relative rotation about this axis , corresponding to both the considered structures of the ( 8,8 ) nanotube are compared as shown in figure  [ fig:04 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:04 ] is a vivid illustration of the significant changes of the barriers @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "the most dramatic change corresponds to the rotation of the fe@c@xmath0 fullerene about the nanotube axis .",
    ".**calculated characteristics of the dynamical behaviour of the c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 fullerenes inside the ( 8,8 ) nanotube of different structure * * [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath25 is the barrier for diffusion of the fullerenes along the nanotube axis , @xmath27 is the barrier for rotation of the fullerenes about the nanotube axis , @xmath29 is the frequency of small relative vibrations of the fullerenes along the nanotube axis , @xmath30 is the frequency of small relative rotational vibrations of the fullerenes about the nanotube axis , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the frequencies of small relative rotational vibrations of the fullerenes about the two mutually perpendicular lateral axes .",
    "let us discuss the reason of the significant changes of the barriers @xmath25 and @xmath27 at the peierls transition by the example of the barrier @xmath27 for rotation of the fe@c@xmath0 endofullerene about the nanotube axis .",
    "figure  [ fig:05 ] presents the dependences @xmath33 of the interaction energies between the endofullerene and individual atoms of the nanotube on the angle @xmath24 of rotation of the fullerene .",
    "figure  [ fig:05 ] shows that maxima of dependences @xmath33 for individual atoms of the nanotube occur at different angles @xmath34 and so the dependence @xmath35 of total energy on the angle of rotation is essentially smoothed . in other words ,",
    "the barrier @xmath27 in the dependence @xmath36 of the _ total _ interaction energy between the endofullerene and the nanotube is less by an order of magnitude than the barriers @xmath37 in the dependences of the interaction energy between the endofullerene and _ only one of the nanotube atoms_. thus , the barrier @xmath38 is very sensitive to the values of the barriers @xmath39 and angles @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the barrier @xmath27 changes considerably at the found changes of the barriers @xmath37 and angles @xmath34 obtained from the peierls distortions of the nanotube structure and the change of the nanotube symmetry at the transition .",
    "it should also be noted that small barriers to relative motion of nanoobjects resulting from the compensation of contributions of individual atoms to the barriers is a phenomenon well studied by the examples of such systems as double - shell carbon nanoparticles  @xcite , double - walled carbon nanotubes  @xcite and a graphene flake in a graphite surface  @xcite .",
    "the considerable changes of barriers for relative rotation of shells at small changes of shell structure were found also for double - shell carbon nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of small vibrations of the fullerenes along the nanotube axis ( @xmath29 ) , rotational vibrations about the nanotube axis ( @xmath30 ) and rotational vibrations about two mutually perpendicular lateral axes ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) are also calculated and listed in table [ table1 ] . the most remarkable change of frequency as a result of the structural phase transition corresponds to rotational vibrations of the fe@c@xmath0 fullerene about the nanotube axis ( this agrees with the changes of the barriers ) .",
    "let us consider the possible changes of the dynamical behaviour of the c@xmath0 and fe@c@xmath0 fullerenes inside the ( 8,8 ) nanotube caused by the structural phase transition .",
    "the peierls instability transition temperature @xmath1 was estimated for the ( 5,5 ) nanotube to correspond to temperature range @xmath40@xmath5  k @xcite . both barriers @xmath25 and @xmath27 and the thermal energy @xmath41 are of the same order of magnitude at the structural peierls phase transition ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , dramatic changes of the diffusion and drift over these barriers can take place at the peierls transition for the considered pairs of the encapsulated molecules and the nanotube .",
    "recently , the diffusion and drift in the periodic potential surface of the interaction energy dependent on the displacement @xmath23 along the nanotube axis and the angle @xmath24 of the rotation about the nanotube axis were considered for the thread - like relative motion of walls of double - walled carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the diffusion coefficient and mobility of a movable wall were obtained  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we consider specific cases of diffusion of the molecules along the nanotube axis and rotational diffusion about this axis . in this case",
    ", the expressions for diffusion coefficients , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , mentioned above and corresponding to the diffusion along the nanotube axis and rotational diffusion about this axis , respectively , take the form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the pre - exponential multipliers in the arrhenius formula for the frequency of jumps of the molecule between two neighbouring global minima of the potential surface @xmath22 , @xmath47 is the distance between neighbouring global minima for the motion of the molecule along the nanotube axis , @xmath48 is the angle between neighbouring global minima corresponding to the molecule rotation about the nanotube axis and @xmath49 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the mobility @xmath50 for the motion along the axis can be easily obtained from the diffusion coefficient @xmath42 using the einstein ratio @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig:03 ] shows that @xmath52  nm and @xmath53  nm for the ( 8,8 ) nanotube with the structure of the metallic phase and the kekule structure , respectively , and @xmath54 for the both structures of this nanotube .    the value of the pre - exponential multiplier @xmath55 in the arrhenius formula is usually considered to be related with the frequency @xmath56 of corresponding vibrations .",
    "we suppose that the ratio @xmath57 remains the same for relative motion of different carbon nanoobjects with graphene - like structure ( nanotube walls and fullerenes ) . for reorientation of the fullerenes of the c@xmath6@c@xmath7 nanoparticle",

    "the temperature dependences of the diffusion coefficients , @xmath63 and @xmath43 , estimated using expressions ( [ d ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig:06 ] .",
    "the dependence of the interaction energy @xmath64 on the displacement of the fullerene c@xmath0 has two different barriers between the neighbour minima for the case of the nanotube with the kekule structure ( see figure  [ fig:04]a ) .",
    "since the frequency of the jumps of the fullerene between the neighbour minima exponentially depends on the barrier , the contribution of jumps over the lower barrier into the total diffusion coefficient is disregarded in these estimations .",
    "the temperature range corresponding to the peierls transition temperature estimates @xmath65@xmath5  k @xcite and the cases @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where the arrhenius formula is adequate , are considered .",

    "figure  [ fig:06 ] shows that the changes of the diffusion coefficients , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , at the peierls transition can be of orders of magnitude .",
    "it is of interest that the diffusion coefficient @xmath62 for rotational diffusion of the c@xmath0 fullerene decreases at the peierls transition with the increase of temperature .",
    "if a molecule is encapsulated inside a nanotube without a structural phase transition , the jump rotational diffusion takes place at low temperatures , @xmath69 , and the free rotation of the molecule occurs at high temperature , @xmath67 .",
    "orientational melting ( a loss of the orientational order with an increase of temperature ) has a crossover behaviour if the structural phase transition is absent .",
    "firstly , orientational melting was considered for two - dimensional clusters with shell structure  @xcite and later for double - shell carbon nanoparticles  @xcite , double - walled carbon nanotubes  @xcite and carbon nanotube bundles  @xcite . in the case where a molecule is encapsulated inside a nanotube with a structural phase transition and the barrier",
