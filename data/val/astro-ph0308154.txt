    "black hole x - ray binaries are close binary systems which contain a stellar mass black hole of @xmath4 and a main sequence or an evolved secondary star ( @xcite ) . the gas from the secondary star forms an accretion disk around the black hole , which causes various types of variations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray rapid variations are of interest because their short time scales of 0.11000 hz indicate their emission originates from the inner region of the accretion flow ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the variations of the x - ray flux hence provide important clues concerning the physics of the accretion flow , and on the nature of the black holes themselves(@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "optical rapid variations from black hole binaries have recently received attention as unique probes of accretion and jet physics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "rapid optical variability was first detected in the black hole binary gx 339@xmath54 during an optically very bright state ( @xmath6 ) in 1981 , when it showed 20s optical qpos with relatively large amplitudes , of order 0.1 mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "qpos of similar amplitude but a 190s period were detected during an optically moderate brightness state ( @xcite ) .",
    "smaller - amplitude qpos , of order 0.01 mag , with periods of 716 s were also reported ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another black hole binary , v404 cyg , exhibited possible 0.7 mag , 10 min variations around the maximum of its x - ray nova outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the object again showed 310 min , 0.01 mag qpos during the decline from the outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 recently provided a rare opportunity to observe rapid variations simultaneously at optical and x - ray wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "its 0.1 mag optical variations on a time scale of seconds exhibited a strong correlation with x - ray variations , with a preceding optical dip ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gx 339@xmath54 exhibited similar optical dips , which were anticorrelated with the x - ray flares ( @xcite ) .",
    "these rapid optical variations tend to appear during the low / hard state . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath7 variations are reported in both a0620 - 00 and x - ray nova mus 1991 even in the quiescent state ( @xcite ) .    the optical emission is generally considered to be thermal emission near the outer portion of the accretion disk , where the temperature is relatively low , of order @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the short - time scale of the rapid variations implies that the emission originates in the inner part of the accretion flow .",
    "the spectrum expected for an optically - thick , geometrically - thin disk ( the so called standard disk ) predicts that most of the released energy is observed in the x - ray range , and only weak optical emission is expected from such an inner region .",
    "the rapid optical variations should hence originate from a non - thermal source , and the most promising candidate for this emission mechanism is synchrotron radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been proposed that strong synchrotron emission can significantly contribute to the optical flux observed in black hole binaries .",
    "@xcite proposes that the low / hard states of black hole binaries are characterized by self - absorbed synchrotron emission from jets observed at radio wavelengths .",
    "the synchrotron emission from jets is proposed to extend to the infrared , and possibly to the optical . in the case of large - scale jets",
    ", a near - infrared jet was directly imaged in grs 1915 + 105 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath9s infrared variations in this object precede the radio variations , and are widely believed to be synchrotron flares associated with the jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic flares at the inner accretion flow are another proposed source of strong synchrotron emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "v4641 sgr is an x - ray binary system with an orbital period of 2.8d , containing a secondary star of 58@xmath10 and a black hole of @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this object first received attention during a luminous outburst in 1999 september . despite its high luminosity , @xmath12 ,",
    "the duration of the outburst was quite short ; it lasted a few hours in the x - ray range ( @xcite ) and one day in the optical range ( @xcite ) .",
    "this system also possesses highly relativistic jets , which were detected by radio observations during this outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source s rapid state transitions make it an ideal candidate to study the relationship between the accretion flow and the jet with multi - wavelength observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we used the standard reduction method for obtained images , and adjusted unfiltered ccd magnitude systems to the @xmath14-system with the same manner described in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data were taken by the rxte porportional counter array ( pca ) using pointed observations from 24.1528.65 may 2002 ( ut ) .",
    "the pca consists of five proportional counter units ( pcus ) which are sensitive in the 260 kev x - ray band ( jahoda et al .",
    "the fields of view of the five pcus are restricted to @xmath15 fwhm by hexagonal collimators which are coaligned ( @xmath16 full width at zero response ) .",

    "counts from the top detector layer in the energy range 210 kev were selected .",
    "particle backgrounds were subtracted using the `` cmvle '' model , and an additional estimated background of 1.0 mcrab due to galactic diffuse emission was also subtracted .",
    "the quoted x - ray flux values were found by dividing the total count rate by the number of active pcus , and scaling to the mean pca count rate of the crab in the same energy band . the x - ray outburst consisted of a period of about 2 days from 2426 may where the flux varied from approximately 550 mcrab , with large fluctuations on time scales of minutes .",
    "after 26.0 may , no significant persistent flux was detected , however there continued to be x - ray flares with peak fluxes as high as 36 mcrab .",

    "as proposed in @xcite , the @xmath24s variations definitely originated from the inner accretion region , where we can not expect strong optical thermal emission .",
    "we conclude that the flat spectral component was caused by a strong contribution of the non - thermal emission , which was the source of short - term variations .",
    "on the other hand , the object became bluer with the increase of the flux during the large flare .",
    "this property strongly indicates that the flaring component was thermal emission .",

    "it should be noted that the non - thermal emission significantly contributes to @xmath2 and @xmath1 bands even at the peak of the flare .",

    "the radio spectra just after the outburst were optically - thin synchrotron emission as shown in figure [ fig:052526radio ] .",
    "the outburst may hence be characterized by long - lived strong synchrotron emission or frequent synchrotron flares which dominated in radio  optical wavelengths . on the other hand",
    ", there is also evidence for thermal flares , for example , the flare in figure [ fig:0524sed ] ( and the flares just after the outburst , see the next section ) .",
    "it is possible that other multiple peaks during the outburst , as seen in the panel ( a ) of figure [ fig : out ] , were also a result of thermal flares .",
    "the complicated light curve of the may outburst is , hence , probably due to the increasing activity of both thermal and non - thermal sources , which must have an unknown relationship to each other .      in x - ray binaries ,",
    "x - ray delays have been observed at onsets of x - ray nova outbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are interpreted as a result of the propagation of a heating wave from an outer accretion disk to the inner disk .",
    "the x - ray nova outburst starts at the outer , low temperature portion of the accretion disk , which first leads the optical brightening , and then , the propagation of the hot region into the inner , high temperature portion triggers the x - ray brightening later ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this model has originally been developed for the uv delay phenomenon observed in dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of x - ray binaries , however , delay times are so long ( a few days ) compared with those in dwarf novae ( a few hours ) that another mechanism is required .",
    "@xcite propose that the long delay times can be interpreted as a result of a longer propagation time into the inner , an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) region with a viscous time scale ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on the x - ray delay of order one day , the transition radius from the standard disk to the adaf is estimated to be @xmath28 during the quiescent state .",
    "the properties of the optical and x - ray variations on jd 2452420 are summarized by i ) the striking similarity of the light curves , ii ) the 7-min x - ray delay , and iii ) the shorter time scale of x - ray variations .",
    "the x - ray delay phenomenon at the onset of x - ray nova outbursts also have characteristics of i ) and iii ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the x - ray delay in v4641 sgr can be also understood in terms of a hot region propagating into the inner portion of accretion flow .",
    "this simple picture should , however , be modified to explain the short time scale of the x - ray lag which is two orders shorter than those observed in other x - ray binaries .",
    "@xcite reported that the x - ray spectrum on jd 2452420 can be described not with a thermal disk , but with compton scattering by a cold neutral medium . on the other hand ,",
    "the source of the optical flares is probably a hot , thermal accretion component in the outer disk .",
    "we now consider a situation that this hot region propagates into the inner region with the viscous time scale .",
    "using the equation ( 5 ) of @xcite with same parameters ( viscous parameter , @xmath29 and temperature , @xmath30 ) , the 7-min x - ray lag corresponds to the distance which the hot region travels , to be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this small distance means that the hot region propagates in the standard disk to near the marginally stable orbit .",
    "under such situation , we can generally expect strong thermal x - ray emission from the inner disk of the temperature about @xmath33 ( @xcite ) . in conjunction with the exceptionally low x - ray / optical flux ratio at the flare peak ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the observed characteristics , that is , non - thermal and low luminosity x - ray emission , are inconsistent with the simple picture .    as well as the x - ray spectrum ,",
    "the optical color is possibly inconsistent with the simple picture .",
    "since the truncation radius is quite small , we need to consider the propagation of the hot region in the standard disk with the thermal time scale .",
    "the propagation speed of the hot region , @xmath35 , can now be estimated with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the sound speed in the hot region ( @xcite ) . using the equation ( 1 ) in @xcite",
    ", we obtain the source of the optical flare at @xmath38 .",
    "it is a much inner region compared with the typical optical source at the outer accretion disk ( @xmath39 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the temperature of the hot region can be estimated from the color .",
    "the de - reddened color of @xmath40 indicates a hot region with the temperature of order @xmath8 , which is the typical temperature at the outer accretion disk during x - ray nova outbursts .",
    "since the temperature in a standard disk strongly depends on the radius , it may hence be problematic that such inner region of @xmath41 can produce flares of the low temperature of @xmath42 .    with these discussions ,",
    "it is evident that the simple picture with a propagating hot region must be improved to explain the observations .",
    "the short x - ray delay may require a propagation time shorter than the viscous or thermal time scale typical for black hole binaries .",
    "if we consider a significant contribution of non - thermal emission , as around the outburst maximum , the temperature of the flare may actually be much higher than @xmath43 k , which leads to a shorter thermal time scale . although the radio observation shows the significant fading and the shift to the optically thin synchrotron emission 7 hours before the flare ( see , figures [ fig:0525x ] and [ fig:052526radio ] ) , it is possible that a rapid radio flare occurred around the optical and x - ray flares , as detected during the outburst .",
    "it is also meaningful to consider a situation where a hot region falls with the free - fall time scale .",
    "if this is the case , the optical emission source can locate at outer region of @xmath44 .",
    "the adaf can achieve such a situation , however , the size of the adaf would be much larger than those proposed in other black hole binaries .",
    "an optically - thick advection dominated flow , or a slim disk , can also reproduce the rapid propagation . @xcite",
    "propose a similar situation to explain the outburst of v4641 sgr in 1999 . according to this model",
    ", the optical emission originated from an intervening medium absorbing / reprocessing x - rays , whose variation of size caused optical variations .",
    "a similar situation can explain the x - ray spectrum described with compton scattering , and possibly the optical and x - ray variations in figure [ fig:0525x ] and [ fig:0526x ] . in the case of the 2002 outburst and the active phase , however , the luminosity of the object was so low that we can not expect the presence of a large , and long - lived super - critical accretion , or slim disk .",
    "it is notable that the short x - ray delay was detected just after the outburst , when the object was presumably in a transition phase from the outburst to the quiescent state .",
    "the x - ray lag on jd 2452421 was longer than that on jd 2452420 , which may imply that the object was just in a rapid state transition to the ordinary quiescent phase .",
    "the rising time scale of the flare was longer on jd 2452421 than that on jd 2452420 .",
    "if the similar flare observed on jd 2452430 ( the panel ( c ) of figure [ fig : active ] ) has the same nature , we can say that the rising time scale was continuously increasing with time for about ten days .",
    "if the rising time scale corresponds to the propagation time of the hot region , the increase of the rising time scale may indicate the expansion of the accretion disk .",
    "although optical short - term modulations were detected during the outburst in 2002 may , the optical flash on jd 24524622452463 has noteworthy characteristics .",
    "first , the object was not in a major outburst , but remained at the quiescent level around jd 2452463 . during the outburst in may ,",
    "the object experienced repeated short flares and the total duration was six days .",
    "on the other hand , variations like in figure [ fig : flash ] were observed only in this period and not on jd 2452461 and 2452464 , which indicates a short duration of this active state .",
    "second , no optical flash was detected during the may outburst .",
    "the @xmath45 s variations during the may outburst have amplitudes of order 0.1 mag , while the optical flash has amplitudes of 1.2 mag .",
    "the unique feature of the optical flash is the huge released energy only within the time scale of 10 s.    using the peak apparent magnitude of @xmath46 mag and the quiescent magnitude ( @xmath47 ) , the optical luminosities are estimated to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . in the above estimations , we assume an interstellar extinction of @xmath50 and a distance of @xmath51 , which are reported in @xcite and @xcite . it should be noted that our observations with exposure times of @xmath52 s may have overlooked more rapid variations and the real peak of the flash , and hence can only provide a lower limit of @xmath53 in the above estimation . the peak released - energy rate of the flash component",
    "is then calculated to be @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the observed optical luminosity of the flash .    on the other hand",
    ", we can estimate a theoretical upper limit of the energy - release rate at a certain portion of an accretion disk .",
    "the observed optical emission on jd 2452463 indicates that the peak luminosity of the flash was much lower than that of the peak of its super - eddington outburst in 1999 september ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate was hence definitely smaller than the critical accretion rate ( @xmath56 ) throughout the active phase , where @xmath57 is the energy conversion rate .",
    "we set a secure upper limit of the mass accretion rate to be @xmath58 based on the optical peak luminosity of the flash . under these assumptions",
    ", the observed energy release rate needs an emission source at @xmath59 the radius of @xmath60 corresponds to a dynamical time scale of 1 s. it is then possible that the optical flux was variable at 1-s scale during the active phase .",
    "our visual observations indeed detected a very rapid variations of order 1 s and amplitudes of 0.30.9 mag during the active phase in 2002 mayjuly.http://vsnet.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/mail/vsnet-campaign-v4641sgr/msg00008.html,msg00026.html , msg00151.html @xmath13 these observations may support the optical emission source at @xmath61 .",
    "such an inner emission source strongly indicates that the optical emission was non - thermal ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical flashes have a time scale shorter than that observed during the outburst in 2002 may , and hence , the scenario with synchrotron emission is even more preferable .",
    "the energy conversion rate in equation ( 1 ) strongly depends on the mechanism of the optical flash .",
    "when we consider a synchrotron optical flash , a part of gravitational energy is first transformed to magnetic energy , which then leads the acceleration of particles and generates synchrotron emission .",
    "the energy conversion rate should therefore be much smaller than 0.1 which is the value for the most effective disk .",
    "if we consider @xmath62@xmath63 , it is possible that the optical flash is an event which occurred at the innermost region of the accretion flow .",
    "when we consider the mechanism of the flash , it is interesting to note that the dips just before the flashes are also reported in the optical short - term variations in xte j1118 + 480 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both variations have a time scale of a few seconds , however , we should note that the released energy during the optical flash is much greater than those of rapid optical variations in xte j1118 + 480 and gx 339@xmath54 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we observed v4641 sgr during the outburst and post - outburst active phase in 2002 at optical , radio , and x - ray wavelengths . in the optical range ,",
    "the object exhibited strong variations with a wide range of periods of @xmath64@xmath65 s. we conclude that @xmath9 s , @xmath66 flares are thermal emission based on their bluer color and the x - ray lag .",
    "the 7-min x - ray lag is , however , too small to be interpreted in terms of a hot region propagating into the inner disk , as in the onset of x - ray nova outbursts .",
    "the short x - ray lag requires an unknown mechanism to account for the short propagation time of the hot region . on the other hand ,",
    "the origin of short - term , @xmath0 variations was presumably synchrotron emission .",
    "the flattening of the optical spectrum at the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3-band region strongly indicates a significant contribution of synchrotron emission even in the optical range .",
    "their amplitudes are even relatively large ( 0.10.5 mag ) compared with other black hole binaries showing optical rapid variations .",
    "contrary to the current framework of the optical rapid variations , the optical flash , which was detected only on jd 24524622452463 , has the unique and surprising characteristics that the object brightened by 1.2 mag only within 30 s. the released energy indicates that the flash occurred at the innermost region of the accretion flow .",
    "it should be noticed that dips were observed just before the flashes , as in xte j1118 + 480 .    to date , v4641 sgr has continued to show us different features whenever it entered active phases .",
    "considering the short duration of an active phase , we have possibly overlooked a number of other active phases .",
    "v4641 sgr has almost all topics to which we have recently paid attention , for example , the disk ",
    "jet relationship , the broad fe emission line in the x - ray range , the non - thermal optical emission , and the rapid optical variation .",
    "therefore , close monitoring in all wavelength is strongly urged not only to reveal the nature of v4641 sgr , but also to fully understand the accretion physics around the black hole .",
    "we are grateful to many amateur observers for supplying their vital visual and ccd estimates via variable star network ( vsnet ; http://vsnet.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/ ) .",
