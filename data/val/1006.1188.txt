    "the physics of pure spin current has been attracting much attention recently in various fields of condensed matter .",
    "pure spin current is a flow of electron spins which is not accompanied by the charge current .",
    "as is different from the spin itself , spin current is even under the time - reversal operation , and thus can be nonzero in nonmagnetic systems .",
    "thereby the spin current has opened up new fields in nonmagnetic condensed materials .",
    "one example is the intrinsic spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite driven by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the she has offered us a new way to inject and detect spin currents in metals and semiconductors .",
    "the physics of topological insulators , also called the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) systems @xcite , is another example of new physics due to the pure spin current . two - dimensional ( 2d ) qsh systems",
    "are insulators in the bulk , while they have gapless edge states .",
    "similarly , three - dimensional ( 3d ) qsh systems ( topological insulators ) are insulators with gapless surface states .",
    "one of the important and novel aspects of these systems is that these gapless edge / surface states are robust against perturbation which respects time - reversal symmetry .",
    "namely , they remain gapless even when nonmagnetic impurities or disorder exist @xcite , which causes novel transport properties @xcite . the robustness of these gapless states can be interpreted as protected by topology .",
    "the qsh systems are characterized by nontrivial z@xmath0 topological number .",
    "the @xmath1 topological number takes only two different values for @xmath2 : @xmath3 ( also called @xmath4even ) or @xmath5 ( also called @xmath4odd ) . when @xmath5 , the system is in the qsh phase , while when @xmath3 the system is in the insulating phase .",
    "this topological number remains unchanged as long as the bulk gap is open and the time - reversal symmetry is preserved .",
    "transitions between ordinary insulator ( @xmath3 ) and the qsh system ( @xmath5 ) occur only when the gap is closed .",
    "the topological classification has been discussed in various theoretical papers , but they might not be easily accessible for non - experts in topology .    instead of directly dealing with the z@xmath0 topological numbers , we take a different route and study the physics of gap - closing .",
    "this has been studied in a series of papers of the author @xcite . in the present paper , we summarize these results in these papers . in generic nonmagnetic band insulators , we examine whether the gap closes when we vary a parameter in the system . as a result",
    "we can classify all the possible types of gap - closing .",
    "in fact , in every case of the gap closing , we show in this paper that the z@xmath0 topological number changes .",
    "namely , the gap - closing physics is equivalent to the phase transition between the qsh system and the ordinary insulator . as a byproduct",
    ", we obtain effective theories focusing on the vicinity of the gap - closing points at the transition .",
    "this gap - closing physics involves local features in @xmath6 space , and is equivalent to global topological structure in @xmath6 space @xcite .",
    "we note that this gap - closing physics tells us only the _ change _ of the topological number , and we can not tell which side of the gap - closing is the topological insulator and which side is thee trivial insulator .",
    "this is the characteristic of the theories involving local features in @xmath6 space . on the other hand",
    ", the gap - closing physics gives us a number of new results , such as effective theories expanded in terms of @xmath7 , or the universal phase diagrams , as we discuss in this paper .    as a result of our analysis",
    ", we get a full understanding of the gap - closing physics , which is different between 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite , and between inversion - symmetric and inversion - asymmetric systems .",
    "the most interesting is the 3d inversion - asymmetric systems ; we find that there necessarily exists a finite region of gapless phase between the qsh phase and the ordinary insulator phase .",
    "this gapless phase is of topological origin , as we describe in this paper .",
    "henceforth we consider only clean systems without any impurities or disorder .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is assumed throughout the paper . in the present paper",
    "we only deal with time - reversal - invariant systems with spin - orbit coupling , without assuming additional symmetries such as spin - rotational symmetry .",
    "therefore , the systems without spin - orbit coupling , such as the organic system with bulk dirac - like bands @xcite , belong to a different class of systems ( orthogonal class ) and are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "putting topological insulators aside for a while , we ask ourselves a general question when and how the gap of a nonmagnetic band insulator ( with spin - orbit coupling ) closes by tuning a _ single",
    "_ parameter @xmath8 in the system .",
    "we assume that the system is time - reversal symmetric . depending on the system considered",
    ", this parameter @xmath8 can have any physical meaning , such as pressure , chemical content , or interatomic distance . because our goal is to pursue the phase transition",
    ", we will focus on gap - closing achieved by tuning a _ single _",
    "parameter @xmath8 in generic systems .",
    "we call such gap closing as  generic gap closing \" .",
    "the word  generic \" means that any terms allowed by symmetry are set to be nonzero .",
    "there are several reasons why we focus on generic gap closing .",
    "first , in real materials there are many factors which determine the band structure .",
    "therefore , any kind of terms in the hamiltonian are set to be nonzero , as long as the terms are allowed by symmetry . in other words",
    ", we assume that there are no accidental degeneracies unless it is required by symmetry .",
    "second , only the _ generic _ gap closings are necessarily related with phase transitions .",
    "nongeneric ones do not correspond to phase transition , because such kind of nongeneric gap - closing may disappear by small perturbation .",
    "( if such nongeneric gap closing does not disappear by perturbation , it is nothing but a generic gap closing studied in this paper .",
    "thus it is enough to study only the generic gap closing . ) by these reasons , non - generic gap - closing which requires fine tuning of some other parameters is excluded in our analysis .    with these reasonable and general assumptions",
    ", we consider a problem whether the gap will close by tuning only a single parameter @xmath8 in the system . in respective cases considered in the following ,",
    "we find necessary conditions for the gap to close , and see whether it can be satisfied by changing a parameter @xmath8 .",
    "we consider a gapped spin-@xmath9 time - reversal - symmetric system with spin - orbit interaction . a hamiltonian matrix for bloch wavefunctions can be written in a block form , @xmath10 the dimensions of the hamiltonian @xmath11 can be arbitrary for the subsequent analysis , but for simplicity we set the dimension to be minimal , as long as the gap - closing physics is appropriately captured ; we retain only the states which are involved in the gap closing . in the following ,",
    "we find that the dimension turns out to be four ( see  [ sec : i - sym ] ) and two ( see  [ sec : i - asym ] ) for the inversion - symmetric and inversion - asymmetric systems , respectively .",
    "the spectrum is assumed to have a gap , within which the fermi energy lies . because the time - reversal operator @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 being complex conjugation , the time - reversal - symmetry results in @xmath15 which is cast into the equations @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    before proceeding to the specific cases ,",
    "we introduce the momenta with @xmath18 ( mod @xmath19 ) where @xmath19 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "such momenta are called the time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) @xmath20 @xcite , and have the values @xmath21 in 3d , and @xmath22 in 2d , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are primitive reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "these momenta are invariant under time - reversal , and are important in the subsequent discussion .    before proceeding to the cases with inversion - symmetric and inversion - asymmetric systems , we explain the definition of inversion symmetry .",
    "the space inversion means that the sign of every space coordinate is changed , and the crucial point here is that the inversion leaves spins unchanged . in three dimensions it means @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in two dimensions",
    "the space coordinates change as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , while it is different from the rotation within @xmath28 plane , because the space rotation changes @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , while inversion does not change spin . to see this more clearly",
    ", we take the rashba spin - orbit term @xmath32 as an example , where @xmath33 is the spin . this term changes sign under inversion since @xmath6 flips its sign while @xmath33 does not .",
    "this sign change under inversion can be regarded as a reversal of the @xmath34 direction , which represents structural inversion asymmetry causing the rashba coupling .      in the inversion - symmetric systems ,",
    "the energies are doubly degenerate at each @xmath6 .",
    "the gap closing involves a doubly - degenerate valence band and a doubly - degenerate conduction band .",
    "hence , four states are involved in gap closing , and we consider 4@xmath354 hamiltonian matrix @xmath11 ( @xmath36 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is 2@xmath352 ) .",
    "the inversion - symmetry is expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a unitary matrix independent of @xmath6 , and @xmath39 is the periodic part of the bloch wavefunction : @xmath40 .",
    "as the inversion does not change spin , this unitary matrix @xmath38 is block - diagonal in spin space : @xmath41 by using ( [ eq : h - inversion ] ) and ( [ eq : p ] ) , after judicious unitary transformation , all cases are shown to reduce to a case @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the parity eigenvalues of the atomic orbitals involved .",
    "occurrence of gap closing turns out to be different for the cases ( i ) @xmath47 and ( ii ) @xmath48 .",
    "the case ( i ) @xmath49 means that the atomic orbitals @xmath50 , @xmath51 have the same parity , such as two @xmath52-like orbitals or two @xmath53-like orbitals . the inversion - symmetry ( [ eq : h - inversion ] ) then imposes that @xmath54 is an even function of @xmath6 , and @xmath55 is an antisymmetric matrix , even function of @xmath6 .",
    "the generic hamiltonian becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 s and @xmath58 are real even functions of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath59 are @xmath60 matrices forming clifford algebra , given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are pauli matrices acting on spin and orbital spaces , respectively .",
    "the eigenenergies are given by @xmath68 .",
    "the gap closes when @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "namely , these five independent equations should be satisfied for the gap to close .",
    "this number is called codimension .",
    "we see that in general there are no solutions of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath8 satisfying these five conditions .",
    "it follows from our assumption of  generic \" systems , i.e. we exclude a possibility that these five conditions are satisfied by accident by only three available parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the gap never closes for ( i ) @xmath47 .",
    "this is caused by the level repulsion between the states with the same parity .",
    "as we can see from this example , when the codimension exceeds the number of available parameters , we can not expect the gap closing to occur in generic systems .",
    "thus the codimension represents how hard it is to achieve gap closing , by overcoming the level repulsion between the conduction and the valence bands .",
    "the result is different for the other case ( ii ) @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 , where the two atomic orbitals have different parity . after a simple calculation , one can write the hamiltonian as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are even functions of @xmath6 , and @xmath78 are odd functions of @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath79 are @xmath60 matrices forming clifford algebra , given by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . in this case",
    "the gap closes when five equations @xmath85 , @xmath86 are satisfied . at generic @xmath6 , these five equations can not be satisfied simultaneously even when a single parameter @xmath8 is changed , again by our assumption of generic systems",
    ". on the other hand , at the trims @xmath87 , the situation is different . at these points",
    "@xmath88 holds , and the odd functions @xmath78 vanish identically , and one has only to tune @xmath77 to be zero .",
    "thus , the gap closes at @xmath89 by tuning a single parameter @xmath8 . by putting @xmath90 , the hamiltonian",
    "is expanded to linear order in @xmath91 as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath8 are constants , and @xmath94 @xmath95 are two - dimensional real constant vectors . in this model , @xmath8 is the parameter which controls the gap closing , and the gap closes at the trim @xmath96 when @xmath97 .",
    "after judicious unitary transformations , the hamiltonian finally becomes block - diagonal ; @xmath98 where @xmath99 with real constants",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "note that in materials with e.g. 3- or 4-fold rotational symmetry within @xmath28 plane , one has @xmath103 and @xmath104 , leading to @xmath105 .",
    "thus we have shown that the generic hamiltonian with spin - orbit coupling with time - reversal- and inversion - symmetries decouples into a pair of hamiltonians describing two - component fermions with opposite sign of the corresponding mass terms .",
    "the eigenenergies are @xmath106 .",
    "the inversion matrix in this basis is written as @xmath107 .    in 3d , by the similar analysis",
    ", we can write down the generic form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "if we assume an additional symmetry of e.g. 3- or 4-fold rotational symmetry within @xmath28 plane , the hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath108 where @xmath109 with real constants @xmath110 and @xmath111 , after unitary transformations . by a unitary transformation ,",
    "this is the same as the hamiltonian for bi@xmath0se@xmath112 discussed in @xcite up to the linear order in @xmath113 .",
    "this model is used in @xcite to discuss disorder effects on the 3d topological insulators .      in the inversion - asymmetric systems ,",
    "the phase transition is quite different from the inversion - symmetric systems .",
    "first we show that the gap can not close at the trims @xmath87 .",
    "this is because at the trims , all the states are doubly degenerate , and the codimension is five @xcite . to see this explicitly , we consider @xmath60 hamiltonian matrix with the constraint ( [ time - reversal ] ) , as the number of states involved is four , it leads to a result @xmath114 where @xmath57 s and @xmath58 are real .",
    "its eigenenergies are given by @xmath68 .",
    "the gap between the two ( doubly - degenerate ) bands close when @xmath115 for @xmath70 , but they can not be satisfied simultaneously by tuning only one parameter @xmath8 .",
    "( we note that @xmath6 is fixed to be @xmath87 . )",
    "therefore , the gap does not close at the trims @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath6 is not among the trims , each band is _ non - degenerate_. we thus retain only one valence and one conduction bands ( therefore the states are involved and @xmath116 ) is set to be 2@xmath352 ) .",
    "equation ( [ time - reversal ] ) gives no constraint for the hamiltonian near @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian near @xmath6 thus reduces to @xmath117 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 are real functions of @xmath6 and @xmath8 , and @xmath118 is a complex function of @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "the gap closes when the three conditions @xmath119 are satisfied , i.e. the codimension is 3 @xcite .    in 2d",
    "there are three variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath8 , which is the same number as the gap - closing conditions ; therefore , the gap can close at some @xmath6(@xmath120 ) when the parameter @xmath8 is tuned .",
    "let @xmath121 to be the value of @xmath8 at the gap closing .",
    "because of the time - reversal - symmetry , the gap closes simultaneously at @xmath122 , at @xmath123 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] ( a ) . in 2d ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian near the gap - closing point @xmath124 reduces to @xmath125 after unitary and scale transformations @xcite .",
    "thus , to summarize our theory in the 2d systems , generic gap - closings are classified into two cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] ( a)(b ) for inversion - asymmetric and inversion - symmetric cases respectively .",
    "other types of gap - closings are prohibited because of level repulsion between the states in the valence and the conduction bands by tuning a single parameter @xmath8 .        in 3d , in contrast with the 2d case",
    ", there are 4 variables @xmath126 , and the situation is different . because the gap - closing condition consists of three equations , it determines a curve in the four - dimensional @xmath127-hyperspace , which we call a `` string '' @xmath111 .",
    "generally , this string @xmath111 in @xmath127-hyperspace occupies a finite region in @xmath8-direction @xmath128 .",
    "within this region @xmath128 the bulk gap is closed and the system is in a gapless phase . as we see in the subsequent discussion , this gapless phase is a topological phase , protected by the existence of monopoles and antimonopoles in @xmath6 space .",
    "we note that we are focusing on the 3d inversion - asymmetric systems .",
    "to see the behavior of the gap - closing points in @xmath6 space , we note that each gap - closing point carries a topological number .",
    "such gap - closing point is regarded as a monopole or an antimonopole in @xmath6 space @xcite .",
    "it can be seen by associating the bloch wavefunctions with nondegenerate spectrum to u(1 ) gauge field in the @xmath6 space ; @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the bloch wavefunction for an @xmath131-th band .",
    "@xmath132 , @xmath133 are called berry connection and berry curvature , respectively .",
    "@xmath134 is called a monopole density . @xmath134 vanishes when the @xmath131-th band is not degenerate with other bands , because @xmath135 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath134 does not vanish when the @xmath131-th band touches with another band in energy at some @xmath6-point @xmath136 .",
    "in such case , the bloch wavefunction can not be expressed as a single continuous function around @xmath136 ; @xmath6 space should be patched with more than one continuous wavefunctions @xcite , as is similar to the vector potential around the dirac monopole @xcite . as a result , @xmath134 is shown to have a @xmath137-function singularity at at @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "for example , for the gap closing at @xmath138 with linear dispersion ( weyl fermion ) @xmath139 where @xmath140 , the monopole density for the lower band is given by @xmath141 , where @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) is called monopole charge . in general the monopole density has the form @xmath144 where the monopole charge @xmath145 is quantized to be an integer .",
    "it is shown that when we vary the system by changing a parameter continuously , the monopole charge is conserved , because of the quantization of the monopole charge .",
    "the only chance for the monopole charge to change is a pair creation or a pair annihilation of a monopole ( @xmath146 ) and an antimonopole ( @xmath147 ) .    , and is an isolated point in the @xmath8-@xmath6 space . only at @xmath148",
    "the system is gapless . for ( a ) inversion - asymmetric systems , on the other hand , the gapless points are created in monopole - antimonopole pairs at @xmath149 , and move in @xmath6-space as @xmath8 is varied .",
    "solid and broken curves represent the trajectories for monopoles and antimonopoles , respectively .",
    "these two curves together form a closed loop , which is the string @xmath111 in  [ sec : i - asym ] .",
    "the system opens a gap only by pair annihilation of these gapless points at @xmath150 . ]    in the present problem of nonmagnetic insulators , because of the time - reversal - symmetry , the distribution of monopole charges is symmetric with respect to @xmath89 : @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the label which is a time - reversed label from @xmath153 . from these arguments",
    "we can see that the simplest case of the gap closing is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monopole](a ) @xcite .",
    "two monopole - antimonopole pairs are created at @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) simultaneously when @xmath149 , and the system becomes gapless .",
    "when @xmath8 is increased further , the monopoles and the antimonopoles move in the @xmath6 space , while the distribution of the monopole charges remains symmetric with respect to @xmath96",
    ". this system can open a gap again only when all the monopole and antimonopole annihilate in pairs .",
    "this occurs at @xmath156 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monopole ] ( a ) .",
    "thus the overall feature of the phase transition is schematically expressed as in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy3d ] .",
    "as the monopoles and antimonopoles are gap - closing points in @xmath6 space , the trajectory of the monopoles and antimonopoles is nothing but the string @xmath111 ( see  [ sec : i - asym ] . ) , describing the set of parameters @xmath127 which satisfy the gap - closing conditions ( [ eq : gapclosingcond ] ) . because the monopole charge is conserved , the monopoles and antimonopoles are created and annihilated only in pairs , which means that the trajectory @xmath111 of the monopoles and antimonopoles form a closed loop in the @xmath157 space .",
    "namely , the string @xmath111 has no end point , because an end point of @xmath111 would violate the conservation of monopole charge . when @xmath158 the system is gapless because there are monopoles and antimonopoles , which are gap - closing points ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : degeneracy ] ( a ) ) . as we have predicted , the gap then should close at non - trim points . in accordance with this expectation ,",
    "the gap closes at the @xmath14 and @xmath193 points ( i.e. non - trim ) at the phase transition .    in the cdte / hgte / cdte quantum",
    "well , the 2d quantum spin hall state has been observed experimentally @xcite . by increasing the well thickness @xmath194 over the critical thickness @xmath195   the system undergoes a transition from the ordinary insulator to the qsh system .",
    "the gap closing here is the class of 2d inversion symmetric system in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy](b ) , and should occur at one of the trims .",
    "indeed , when @xmath196 , the bulk gap closes at the @xmath197 point ( i.e. trim ) , and the parity eigenvalues are exchanged .",
    "moreover , the effective model is discussed in @xcite up to the @xmath198 order",
    ". we can compare it to our effective theory ( [ eq : case - b ] ) and they are in complete agreement to the linear order in @xmath7 .",
    "we take the 3d tight - binding model proposed by fu , kane and mele @xcite on a diamond lattice as an example .",
    "this model shows a transition between sti and wti .",
    "this model is 3d inversion symmetric , and the gap should close at one of the trim . indeed , as calculated in @xcite , the band gap closes at one of the x points .",
    "furthermore , one can use this model to confirm the universal phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram-3d ] , including the topological gapless phase for inversion - asymmetric 3d systems . we explain it , following the analysis in ref  @xcite .",
    "we break inversion symmetry by adding a staggered on - site potential @xmath191 , and calculate the phase diagram .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase - dia1](b ) , where the vertical axis represents the staggered on - site potential , corresponding to the parameter @xmath137 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram-3d](a ) , thus we can see that if we break the inversion symmetry there occurs a finite region of a gapless phase in the phase diagram .",
    "these are in accordance with our theory .",
    "furthermore , the trajectory of the gap closing points ( not shown in this paper , details are in @xcite ) agrees with fig .",

    "( b ) the phase diagram in the @xmath206-@xmath191 plane .",
    "we have introduced @xmath191 into the fu - kane - mele model . here",
    "@xmath207 is changed , while we fix @xmath208 .",
    "the arrows in ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the identical change in parameters . ]    bi@xmath0se@xmath112 and bi@xmath0te@xmath112 @xcite are topological insulators under intensive experimental and theoretical research .",
    "their bulk bands have a direct gap at the @xmath197 point .",
    "the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band have the opposite parities at the @xmath197 point , and if the spin - orbit coupling is weakened their energies will be reversed and they become ordinary insulators . in other words , topological insulator phases in these materials are due to the gap closing at the @xmath197 point by making the spin - orbit coupling larger .",
    "these are inversion - symmetric , and are classified to the 3d inversion - symmetric systems , whose gap closing occurs only at the trims , in agreement with the above discussion . the effective model is constructed in @xcite , and is in agreement with our theory in ( [ eq:3deff ] ) up to linear order in @xmath6 .    both in 2d and in 3d , bismuth @xcite , antimony and their alloys @xcite also are interesting materials for topological insulators @xcite .",
    "the 3d bi has @xmath40 , while the 3d sb has @xmath41 .",
    "this is opposite to the case of the 2d @xcite .",
    "( note that although bi and sb are semimetals , there are direct gap everywhere in the brillouin zone .",
    "this makes @xmath1 topological invariants well - defined , by artificially making the bands to be fully gapped by continuous deformation of the bands to eliminate the small carrier pockets . ) to resolve this , numerical analysis was performed in @xcite by artificially changing the interlayer hopping weakened by a factor @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) . between @xmath211 ( 3d limit ) and @xmath212 ( 2d limit ) ,",
    "the gap closes at several parameter values of @xmath209 , and this is described by the gap closing in inversion - symmetric 3d systems .",
    "the gap closes only at the trims , in accordance with our theory .",
    "to summarize , we analyze gap closings in 2d and 3d nonmagnetic insulators by tuning a parameter .",
    "we obtain the universal phase diagrams in 2d and 3d , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram-3d ] , in a plane of the control parameter @xmath8 and another parameter @xmath137 representing an inversion - symmetry breaking . the overall behavior of gap closing is schematically shown in fig .  [ fig : degeneracy ] for 2d and fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy3d ] for 3d .",
    "we find that in inversion - asymmetric 3d systems , there lies a finite region of the gapless phase between the quantum spin hall and ordinary insulator phases .",
    "we checked this for the fu - kane - mele model .",
    "we described the phase transition in terms of the motion of the gap - closing points ( i.e. monopoles and antimonopoles ) in @xmath6 space .",
    "the gapless phase in the inversion - asymmetric 3d system originates from the conservation of `` monopole charge '' .",
    "these cases of gap - closing exactly coincide with the phase transitions between the qsh and the insulating phases . in this sense",
    "our theory characterizes the qsh phase from the local features in @xmath6 space .",
    "all the known models exhibiting phase transition between the two phases are special cases of this general classification . to confirm this scenario , experimental pursuit of 3d",
    "inversion - asymmetric topological insulators will be interesting and important .",
