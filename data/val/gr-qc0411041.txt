    "black holes are one of the most fascinating objects for theoretical physics , especially for general relativity . strikingly , they have thermodynamic properties based on the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula and the hawking s renowned effect  @xcite , which might be a touchstone of quantum theory of gravity .",
    "unfortunately , however , it seems to be impossible to detect the hawking radiation from realistic astrophysical black holes because the hawking temperature of astrophysical black holes is so low that its intensity is too weak to be detected . for the purpose of confirming the hawking radiation",
    ", it will be greatly helpful to perform laboratory experiments using some kinds of analogy .",
    "there are a lot of works about an acoustic `` black hole '' as the experimental field for hawking radiation .",
    "the acoustic black hole has a sound horizon corresponding to an event horizon of a black hole spacetime .",
    "unruh  @xcite originally suggested a hydrodynamic analog of an event horizon  @xcite as a more accessible phenomenon which might shed some light on the hawking effect . in principle , an event horizon for sound waves appears wherever there is a closed surface through which a fluid flows inwards at the speed of sound . in the vicinity of the surface ,",
    "the flow is subsonic on one side and supersonic on the other side ; there is a close analogy between sound propagation on a background hydrodynamic flow and field propagation in a curved spacetime .",
    "thus , if such an analogous black hole is materialized , it will be experimentally powerful tool for confirming the hawking radiation .",
    "there are some works in this direction  @xcite .",
    "recently , the subject has attracted much attention  @xcite .    in order to detect the hawking radiation in the experimental laboratory",
    ", thermal fluctuations will become main obstacles .",
    "therefore we consider an acoustic black hole in the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) system at low temperature .",
    "thanks to recent technological advances , the bec has been observed in 1995 in a remarkable series of experiments on vapors of rubidium  @xcite and sodium  @xcite in which the atoms were confined in magnetic traps and cooled down to extremely low temperature , of the order of fractions of microkelvins .",
    "( see the review paper  @xcite about the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation of dilute gases from a theoretical perspective . )",
    "et al_.  @xcite have analyzed in detail the case of a condensate in a ring trap , and proposed a realistic scheme for adiabatically creating stable acoustic black / white holes .",
    "it seems to be possible to materialize an acoustic black hole in the bec system .",
    "astrophysical black holes will obey the uniqueness theorem for black hole spacetimes , and there will be no hair other than mass , angular momentum and electric charge . on the other hand , it will be possible to realize analogous black holes having many hairs .",
    "since analogous black holes have geometrical correspondence , it means that many kinds of geometry will be realized in the analogous systems .",
    "thus , it is necessary to identify which corresponding classical geometry is realized in the experiments .",
    "geometries of acoustic black holes are decided by physical situations ( e.g. the equations of state , boundary conditions on fluid systems and so on ) .",
    "since what directly affects sound waves or hawking radiations is its background geometry or wave equation on the analogous curved spacetime , it is needed to confirm whether the required geometry is materialized or not by detecting some kind of a physical phenomenon which is not determined by factors except for the geometry .    without this confirmation",
    ", we can not clean away the fear of false geometries or false analogies .",
    "one of the ways to do it is to detect damped oscillating waves of fluid fluctuations under some perturbation .",
    "we make a point that the modes of damped oscillations in the linear phase are uninfluenced by given perturbation and directly depend only on the geometry .",
    "this damped oscillating waves are well known as quasinormal ringdown waves for astrophysical black holes context .",
    "the first order perturbed einstein equation gives a wave equation , and quasinormal modes ( qnms ) are complex frequency solutions of the wave equation with a purely outgoing - wave boundary condition at infinity and ingoing - wave at the horizon , with vanishing incoming - wave amplitude .",
    "they have geometrical information outside the horizon and , in fact , the quasinormal ringdown waves have astrophysical significance and are searched by using the data from the gravitational wave detectors  @xcite . in this paper , we analyze quasinormal ringdown waves of an acoustic black hole with the procedures which are frequently used in analysis about those of astrophysical ones , and using the qnms of this wave , we discuss the distinguishability of the geometry .    on the other hand , there is a subtle problem concerning the detection of qnms in gravitational astrophysics . for the purpose of designing the gravitational wave detector or making the data analysis , we must predict theoretically amplitudes of gravitational waves which we want to detect .",
    "the amplitude depends on the energy which is extracted by the gravitational waves from sources such as supernovae or neutron star mergers .",
    "thus it is important to know how many energies of the process transport to the gravitational waves . when it comes to quasinormal ringdown waves , however , it depends on the final phase of the gravitational wave emission process such as black hole formation ; hence we need to clarify all the emission processes including nonlinear phases ( e.g. the merger phase of binary neutron star systems ) for the estimation of the amplitudes .",
    "generally , this theoretical estimation can be done only with complicated numerical works which is not yet sufficiently accurate at the present time .",
    "some data analysis has been done on the assumption that the energy transport is a few percent to the background black hole mass , however this assumption does not have much foundation @xcite . if analogous black holes are realized in some experimental laboratories , we will obtain some suggestion about the energy extraction rate by qnms . therefore the study of qnms in acoustic black holes",
    "is also significant in this direction .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an analogous black hole in a bose - einstein condensate and predict the quasinormal ringdown waves in the system for the purpose of investigating their corresponding classical geometry .",
    "the bec system has some remarkable properties that it is a quantum mechanical system and its dynamical evolution obeys the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , in which any profile of its density can be materialized freely by controlling the exterior potential in actual experiments .",
    "the linearized gp equation gives a wave equation which corresponds to that on a black hole background , giving qnms under some appropriate conditions . in order to derive the quasinormal frequencies",
    ", we will use the wkb method given by schutz and will @xcite .",
    "some quasinormal frequencies in the case where the section area of a nozzle is constant and the background density has some combinations of ` power - form ' will be shown .",
    "this choice of the background density covers for all scale invariant forms of the density , where the power of the density is a unique parameter for the system .",
    "this fact will be helpful for actual experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gpe ] , we summarize the gross - pitaevskii equation which is the equation of motion of a bose - einstein condensed matter , and the linearized gross - pitaevskii equation . and then , an acoustic black hole which has an event horizon for sound wave is shown by considering the differential equation .",
    "the detailed analysis has been discussed by c.  barcelo , s.  liberati and m.  visser  @xcite and we summarize it in the appendix . for this black hole ,",
    "we calculate the qnms by using the wkb approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : qnm ] . finally , we show how to confirm the geometrical information and discuss the remaining problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "now , in order to consider a bose - einstein condensate , we introduce the field operator @xmath0 which is divided into two parts as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is called as the order parameter and @xmath3 is some perturbation around the order parameter .",
    "the order parameter is a complex function defined as the expectation value of the field operator , and written as the following form : @xmath4 here , the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote a condensate density and a phase factor of the condensed matter , respectively .",
    "the order parameter is a classical field called the `` wave function of the condensate '' . in the following ,",
    "we ignore @xmath3 and consider only this order parameter .",
    "when the number of atoms is large and the atomic interactions are sufficiently small in the vicinity of zero temperature , the gross - pitaevskii equation is the equation of motion of a condensed matter @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the atoms , @xmath9 is the scattering length and the atoms are trapped by an external potential @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this has the form of a `` nonlinear schrdinger equation '' .",
    "substituting eq .",

    "this approximation is considered as a low frequency approximation .",
    "and then , we obtain the simple equation : @xmath22 eliminating the density perturbation @xmath17 from eqs .",

    "we will give some discussion about this approximation in sec .",

    "we shall call this system with the horizon an acoustic black hole , because this has an event horizon for sound waves .",

    "a single black hole case has been discussed . using the wkb method @xcite , we have derived some quasinormal frequencies in the case where the background density has a power form or some combination of power forms .",
    "the qnms in this system can be considered as the ringdown waves emitted from a perturbed acoustic black hole as in the usual astrophysics context .",

    "one exception occurs in the case of extremal black holes whose hawking temperature equals zero .",

    "if the acoustic black hole which has the same geometry as the schwarzschild black hole is realized in some experiment , it is quite meaningful . why we could not obtain the geometry is because the sound velocity @xmath24 and the background velocity @xmath33 are related to the density @xmath5 as eq .",
    "( [ eq : den - rel ] ) . in order to obtain a schwarzschild black hole in the bec",
    ", we have to consider other fluid configurations  @xcite .",
    "and then , the quasinormal frequencies are solvable by using the leaver s method  @xcite in which we may solve the three - term recurrence relation .    in our study",
    ", we have considered the low frequency approximation for the linearized gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this is relevant in the region where the wavelength of sounds is much longer than the healing length of the system .",
    "the quasinormal ringdown waves obtained in this paper satisfy the condition and therefore , our investigation is appropriate .",
    "the qnms obtained in this paper depend on the outer geometry from the sound horizon .",
    "the higher damped modes which are not obtained in this paper will depend on the geometry in the vicinity of the horizon , where , however , the wavelength becomes shorter and shorter due to the blue shift effect associated with the horizon .",
    "when we intend to obtain the higher damped modes and , correspondinly , the information about horizon , we can not use the low frequency approximation and have to investigate the full linearized gross - pitaevskii equation .    in this case",
    ", we can not obtain a single second order differential equation for the condensate phase perturbation , and sound waves will break the causality because their propagation speed may become infinity .",
    "there are many papers about this `` broken '' lorentz invariance problem  @xcite .    recently , konoplya studied the influence of the back reaction of the hawking radiation upon qnms in the case of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional black hole  @xcite .",
    "such effects might be more important in this bec system because the influence will give some information about the hawking radiation at low temperature .",

    "in this appendix , we summarize the derivation of the curved metric ( [ eq : metrik ] ) from the wave equation ( [ eq : vpe ] ) . more detailed analysis has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "using the background continuity equation ( [ eq : contb ] ) , we rewrite the wave equation ( [ eq : vpe ] ) for the linear perturbation of a velocity potential as @xmath95 now , let us compare the above equation with the scalar wave equation in a general curved spacetime : @xmath96 \\ , , \\label{eq : covariantdar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 denotes a metric and @xmath98 is its determinant .",
