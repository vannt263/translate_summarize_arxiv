    "analytic calculations of still higher - order contributions  @xcite to @xmath17 are as yet too complex to carry out , except for fully inclusive processes , such as the drell - yan production of lepton pairs at measured invariant mass  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , general arguments show that the functions @xmath17 are infrared safe to all orders @xcite .",
    "starting at nlo , the computation of @xmath17 involves cancellations between soft gluon emission and virtual corrections .",
    "these cancellations produce plus distributions and delta functions , which require integration against smooth functions , such as parton densities .",
    "the finite integrals , in turn , are potential sources of numerically large corrections at each order in perturbation theory . because of their connection to soft - gluon emission , however , such corrections can sometimes be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory .",

    "threshold resummations , which organize these distributions , have been developed for a large class of cross sections @xcite .",

    "thus , threshold resummation is not a summation of kinematic logarithms in the physical cross section .",
    "it is rather an attempt to quantify the effect on the physical cross section of a well - defined set of corrections in @xmath17 to all orders .",

    "these divergences , resummed or not , cancel in the @xmath1-integrated cross section , even before the integrals over the partonic fractions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , although the remainder is still singular at partonic threshold .",
    "much of the recent interest in soft - gluon recoil effects has centered on the normalization and @xmath0-dependence of single - particle inclusive cross sections @xcite , particularly direct - photon production at fixed - target energies @xcite .",
    "the formalism of @xmath1 resummation for eq .",
    "( [ dyqtcofact ] ) is not immediately applicable to inclusive high-@xmath0 cross sections , because in this case most of the transverse momentum of the observed particle is recoil against other high-@xmath0 particles , while only a small portion is from soft radiation .",
    "a rough - and - ready approach to soft - gluon radiation is to introduce intrinsic transverse momentum for the partons in factorized expressions like eq .",
    "( [ dyqtcofact ] ) , typically in the form of an energy - dependent gaussian smearing of standard parton densities , which enhances the cross section .",
    "this method , however , certainly involves double counting , and does not respect the conservation of partonic energy .",
    "some time ago , li and lai explored the possibility that nonperturbative @xmath29 smearing in high-@xmath0 cross sections has the same origin as in the low-@xmath1 drell - yan cross sections described by the @xmath1-resummation formalism @xcite .",
    "more recently , li @xcite has shown how threshold and transverse momentum resummation may be derived from the same parton distribution , defined in transverse momentum space , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the conservation of energy is taken into account , however , it is no longer obvious whether the inclusion of recoil effects will lead to an enhancement or a suppression , because the extra radiation involves a number of competing effects . on the one hand , a substantial @xmath29 from initial - state radiation allows a softer @xmath30 subprocess at the hard scattering , which clearly acts toward enhancement . on the other hand",
    ", the extra energy of the initial - state radiation drives the physical parton distributions to larger @xmath31 , which may more than make up for enhancements in the hard scattering if the distributions are decreasing with @xmath31 . at the same time , larger @xmath31 is associated with larger threshold enhancements in general . the only way to estimate the influence of recoil effects on cross sections is to develop a self - consistent resummation formalism .    in this paper , we shall take up , and we hope clarify , this general viewpoint .",
    "our reasoning is based on a generalization of threshold resummation which , as we have seen , controls singular distributions at @xmath32 . for electroweak annihilation and single - particle inclusive cross sections ,",
    "such contributions are always associated with an underlying @xmath33 hard scattering @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath30 subprocess to define the relevant transverse momentum @xmath1 , whose singularities we resum .",
    "the recoil we discuss below is always the recoil of a @xmath30 subprocess .",
    "thus , just as for threshold resummation , we reorganize a well - defined set of higher order corrections in hard scattering functions , always working at leading power in the hard scale , @xmath8 , within collinear factorization . we do not exclude the possibility of nonperturbative effects , however .",
    "indeed , we will observe that nonperturbative corrections arise quite naturally from our resummed expressions .",
    "a summary of our results , applied to prompt photon cross sections , was described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us offer a few additional comments on nonperturbative effects in these cross sections .",
    "nonperturbative effects play a crucial role in the phenomenological description of electroweak annihilation cross sections at low @xmath1 , even for a large final state mass scale @xmath8 .",
    "this is the case , even after the resummation of logarithms of @xmath34 that can give a well - defined perturbative prediction for small @xmath1 . incorporating nonperturbative effects , of course",
    ", requires the introduction of new parameters  @xcite . in each of these cases , the form of nonperturbative corrections",
    "is suggested by perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , nonperturbative effects ( beyond fragmentation functions ) have not been incorporated in prompt photon and other single - particle inclusive cross sections , where there is no need for them at fixed order in perturbation theory . for threshold - resummed cross sections",
    "the situation is somewhat more subtle , but  minimal \" formulations of threshold resummation allow for a class of purely perturbative predictions  @xcite , with no new parameters .",
    "of course , the existence of such a formalism does not by itself preclude the importance of nonperturbative effects . in this paper",
    ", we develop a perturbative formalism that links both sorts of cross sections , and which is consistent with known results that have suggested nonperturbative corrections at measured @xmath1 in electroweak annihilation .",
    "part of our goal is to open the door , not only to further perturbative analysis , but also to the study of similarities and differences in the roles of nonperturbative corrections in these cases .",
    "we choose to work in the formalism of collinear factorization because we do not wish to introduce a new set of phenomenological parton distributions , depending on transverse as well as longitudinal degrees of freedom , except where absolutely necessary   @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that it is important to explore fully the simpler formalism . ] .",
    "the resulting combination of threshold and transverse momentum resummations is at least as technically challenging as nlo factorization , let alone @xmath1-resummation , and the new formalism will require some time to understand and develop as a practical tool . we therefore do not attempt to draw immediate phenomenological conclusions in this paper .",
    "instead , we shall concentrate on the formal development , and ( especially in appendix a ) the theoretical underpinning of these ideas .",
    "we have attempted to be as explicit as possible in our arguments and in specifying the functions whose momentum - dependence controls the set of higher - order corrections that we study .",
    "this has resulted in a paper of substantial , although we hope not excessive , length .",
    "we begin in sec .  2 with a treatment of electroweak annihilation processes , such as drell - yan and higgs production ,",
    "whose singular behavior at vanishing transverse momentum has been studied intensively over the years @xcite , and which is in many ways the archetype for resummation .",
    "we show how to introduce threshold resummation consistently at measured @xmath1 for these processes .",
    "our approach to resummation is through a  refactorization \" of partonic cross sections near threshold @xcite . in this discussion",
    ", we shall review the refactorizations at the basis of @xmath1 and threshold resummations , and define a set of new functions which control singular behavior in @xmath35 and @xmath1 jointly .",
    "these will serve as building blocks both for electroweak annihilation cross sections , in sec .  3 , and for single - particle inclusive processes , in sec .",
    "resummation at threshold and in transverse momentum is most often formulated in mellin ( @xmath36 ) moment space for the former , and impact parameter ( @xmath20 ) space for the latter . resummed logarithms of these parameters exponentiate in the relevant limits , so that the resummed cross sections are inverse transforms . in sec .",
    "3 we resum logarithms of @xmath20 and @xmath36 in the electroweak annihilation cross sections .",
    "we begin by deriving a relation for the hadronic @xmath37 in terms of parton distributions , eikonal cross sections for partons , and universal anomalous dimensions .",
    "we observe that this jointly - resummed cross section determines the pattern of power corrections in @xmath8 and @xmath20 that are implied by the behavior of the strong coupling in perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , we find that in qcd such power corrections appear only at even powers of the invariant mass @xmath8 and impact parameter @xmath20 .",
    "4 deals first with prompt photon production , and then with general high-@xmath0 single - hadron or photon inclusive cross sections . for the former ,",
    "we derive the joint resummation applied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the latter we discuss the additional resummation associated with fragmentation .",
    "explicit nll expressions for jointly - resummed exponents in electroweak annihilation and prompt photon production are given in sec .  5 , along with a few comments on the source of enhancement at nll . following our conclusions ,",
    "we include two appendices .",
    "the first gives the necessary arguments for factorization and refactorization , and the second gives explicit one - loop results for some of the functions that play an important role in the refactorizations of hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "as above , @xmath8 denotes the mass of an electroweak final state , such as a vector boson , a drell - yan pair or a higgs boson . the cross section @xmath37 , at measured @xmath38 and @xmath1 , given in factorized form in eq .",
    "( [ dyqtcofact ] ) , is singular at @xmath27 , order - by - order in perturbation theory .",
    "there are a number of phenomenological applications of @xmath1-resummation for these singularities @xcite .",
    "we know of no simultaneous application of threshold resummation , however , although the cross sections are singular as well at partonic threshold , @xmath39 .",
    "as pointed out above , distributions that are singular at threshold are smoothed in the physical cross section by integration with the parton densities .",
    "nevertheless , there is a good deal to be learned by resumming singular behavior from the limit @xmath40 , even at fixed , measured @xmath1 @xcite . to derive a cross section resummed both in threshold and @xmath1 variables , we study partonic cross sections @xmath41 near threshold , where @xmath10 and @xmath20 are partons , and where @xmath42 denotes the heavy electroweak final state @xmath43 , etc .",
    "we begin by formulating the problem in a standard form , through collinear factorization .    in this section , which is rather technical in parts",
    ", we lay the groundwork for our derivation of jointly resummed cross sections .",
    "we have chosen to present our new formalism in the context of a review of existing resummations , for the purpose of motivation , and also to bring together a set of results and methods that are somewhat scattered in the literature .",
    "it may be helpful , therefore , to outline the contents and aims of the subsections that follow .",
    "we begin ( subsection 2.1 ) by relating the hard - scattering functions that we will resum to partonic cross sections . in subsection 2.2 , we review existing refactorizations for partonic cross sections , which have been used to derive resummations for electroweak annihilation at low transverse momentum @xcite and at partonic threshold @xcite .",
    "we then go on to present a novel refactorization that combines the two ( eq .",

    "each of the refactorization theorems in subsection 2.2 also includes a function that describes coherent radiation , which summarizes the interference between emission by incoming and outgoing hard partons .",
    "an analysis of coherent radiation is especially important for processes in which colored particles emerge from the hard scattering @xcite , the simplest of which is prompt photon production .",
    "this interference may be treated in eikonal approximation .",
    "the analysis of the eikonal approximation to soft gluon radiation is the subject of subsection 2.4 , in which various eikonal analogs of the densities in 2.3 are introduced . finally ( subsection 2.5 ) , we review the use of mellin and fourier transforms to isolate hard - scattering functions .",
