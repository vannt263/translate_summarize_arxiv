    "the principal scientific goal of the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ; silverberg et al .",
    "1993 ) aboard the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ; boggess et al .",
    "1992 ) spacecraft was to detect the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) in 10 broad bands from the near  infrared ( near  ir ) at 1.25 @xmath0 to the far  ir at 240 @xmath0 .",
    "the energy in the cib arises from thermonuclear processes within stars , and to a lesser extent from gravitational energy release by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . at near  ir wavelengths , these energy sources are observed directly in the cib . at the far  ir wavelengths , the cib is thermal emission from dust that is heated by either starlight or the emission from agns . at all ir wavelengths ,",
    "the cib will contain a blend of emission from galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "as such , the cib forms an integral constraint for models of the dominant processes of energy release over the history of the universe .",
    "the dirbe succeeded at detecting the cib at 140 and 240 @xmath0 ( see hauser & dwek 2001 for a review ) . in these bands ,",
    "local foregrounds from interplanetary dust ( i.e. zodiacal light ) and our own galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) are only about as bright as the cib itself . at the shorter wavelengths , galactic stars and zodiacal emission",
    "are brighter than the cib .",
    "the latter foreground can be removed by modeling its spatial and temporal variations over the course of the dirbe mission .",
    "most of the uncertainties in the removal of the zodiacal light arise from uncertainties in the intensity of its isotropic component .",
    "the main uncertainties in the removal of the galactic stellar emission arise from the removal of the diffuse emission from faint unresolved stars , since bright resolved stars can be readily removed from the dirbe maps by blanking .",
    "various methods have been used to remove the diffuse galactic stellar emission component : ( 1 ) hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used a faint star model ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 ) , based on sky , a star count model developed by wainscoat et al .",
    "uncertainties associated with this stellar emission model and the removal of zodiacal light prevented the detection of the cib at near ",
    "ir wavelengths ; ( 2 ) dwek & arendt ( 1998 ) created an empirical map of the starlight at 2.2 @xmath0 directly from the dirbe map , and used it as a spatial template for the starlight emission at the other near  ir wavelengths .",
    "their procedure yielded a 3.5 @xmath0 cib estimate that was definitely non ",
    "zero , but did not meet strict isotropy requirements ; ( 3 ) wright & reese ( 2000 ) used a statistical method , comparing histograms of simulated star counts with histograms of map intensities , to determine the residual background emission at 2.2 and 3.5 @xmath0 ; ( 4 ) gorjian , wright & chary ( 2000 ) subtracted the contribution of stars resolved by ground  based observations at 2.2 and 3.5 @xmath0 from a dark patch of the dirbe sky to estimate the cib at these wavelengths .",
    "wright ( 2001 ) , and cambrsy et al . ( 2001 ) performed a similar analysis at 1.25 and 2.2 @xmath0 using two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) star counts to subtract the bulk of the galactic stellar emission .",
    "each of these studies arrived at an estimate of the cib at these wavelengths ; ( 5 ) a very different approach to detecting the cib has been pursued by kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) and kashlinsky & odenwald ( 2000 ) . in these studies , the random fluctuations of the confusion limited cib",
    "is measured instead of the mean level .",
    "various measures of these fluctuations ( e.g. variance , two  point correlation function , power spectrum ) can be related to the mean cib in the context of a chosen cosmological model .",
    "this approach yields results that are independent of the uncertainties in the zero - point of the dirbe data and the foreground emission models , but do rely on accurate assessment and modeling of the instrument and foreground variations .",
    "the positive detection of the near  ir cib with the near infrared spectrometer ( nirs ) on the _ infrared telescope in space _ ( _ irts _ ) by matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is very important , since it is the only measurement of the absolute cib intensity based on a data set other than the dirbe data .",
    "however , while the raw data sets are independent measurements , this analysis of the nirs data did use the kelsall et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model to subtract the zodiacal light emission from the nirs sky maps .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt an empirical approach to modeling the galactic stellar and ism emission at 3.5 @xmath0 .",
    "observations at another wavelength are used as an emission template which is than scaled by a constant multiplicative factor to represent the 3.5 @xmath0 emission .",
    "dwek & arendt ( 1998 ) used this approach to model stellar emission at observed by dirbe at 1.25 , 3.5 , and 4.9 @xmath0 using the 2.2 @xmath0 emission as a one  component model template .",
    "puget et al . ( 1996 ) and schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) have used this approach in modeling zodiacal emission at wavelengths @xmath2 @xmath0 with a scaled version of the 25 @xmath0 emission .",
    "arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) modeled ism emission in this manner using the 100 @xmath0 emission as a spatial template at 3.5  240 @xmath0 , and , in turn , 21 cm h i emission as a template for 100 @xmath0 emission .",
    "the common drawback of all these models is that with only a single spatial component , they can not account for any deviation from the mean spectrum ( or scaling factor ) of the modeled emission .",
    "arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) addressed the problem in the context of the 240 @xmath0 ism emission by constructing a two  component model using both the 100 and 140 @xmath0 emission as templates .",
    "observationally , this was suggested by the fact that the color  color plot at these wavelengths exhibits a fairly tight correlation , which is associated with variation of the mean temperature of ism dust grains .",
    "functionally , the use of two templates provides an estimate of both the intensity and the color of the emission at all locations .",
    "this enables a better extrapolation of the observed emission to other wavelengths .",
    "equivalently , a two  component model can be viewed as a means of decomposing emission that arises from two spatially and spectrally distinct phases or populations .",
    "such a decomposition can be applied even if the templates themselves are a combination of the true physical components , as long as they are not combinations in the same proportions .",
    "this two - component ism model was a significantly more accurate representation of the ism emission , which allowed hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to demonstrate isotropy of the detected cib emission .",
    "following this example , we now develop an empirical two  component model for the near - ir galactic stellar emission .",
    "one version of this model will ignore extinction effects , and is used only at higher galactic latitudes .",
    "a second version of the model includes adjustments for extinction , and is derived and applied at all latitudes . without the adjustments , the color variations traced by the two component model would be caused by interstellar reddening , rather than by intrinsic changes in the stellar emission . for the ism emission , which is much fainter than the stellar emission in the near  ir , we continue to use the one  component model of arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , although here the parameters of the ism and stellar models will be derived simultaneously .",
    "in  2 we present our new model for the 3.5 @xmath0 zodiacal - light - subtracted emission in which the stellar component is represented by a linear combination of the extinction  corrected stellar emission at 2.2 and 4.9 @xmath0 , the ism component is modeled using its far  ir emission , and the cib is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "the optical depths at these wavelengths are expressed in terms of the stellar emission at 1.25 and 2.2 @xmath0 , where the extinction is largest and the dust emission negligible .",
    "the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) extinction law is used to scale the extinction to other wavelengths .",
    "the residual emission , obtained after subtraction of the stellar and ism emission components from the zodi  subtracted 3.5 @xmath0 dirbe maps , should be equal to the 3.5 @xmath0 cib . in practice , we show that with this purely empirical model the 3.5 @xmath0 residual is a linear combination of the cib emission at 2.2 , 3.5 , 4.9 , and 100 @xmath0 . in  3 we report the level and uncertainties of the residual emission , and discuss its isotropy in  4 .",
    "these results , combined with those of previous studies , allow us to constrain the cib at 4.9 @xmath0 (  5 ) . in ",
    "6 , we show that our model leads to a clearer map of the large  scale near ",
    "ir ism emission than has previously been obtained .",
    "the results of our paper are briefly summarized in  7 .",
    "the observed 3.5 @xmath0 emission [ after subtraction of the zodiacal light emission by kelsall et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ] is the sum of galactic stellar and ism foreground emission components and a cosmic infrared background @xmath3    dwek & arendt ( 1998 ) modeled the 3.5 @xmath0 galactic stellar emission , @xmath4 , by using the observed 2.2 @xmath0 emission as an empirical spatial template with a scaling factor determined by a least ",
    "squares fit . in the present analysis we use the same general approach of employing the observed emission at other wavelengths as empirical spatial templates of the 3.5 @xmath0 galactic stellar emission , but we make modifications in two respects .",
    "first , we use _ two _ spatial templates , the 2.2 @xmath0 emission and the 4.9 @xmath0 emission .",
    "this allows a more accurate modeling of the 3.5 @xmath0 emission assuming that there are two distinct components to the stellar emission at each of these wavelengths . in this case",
    ", the linear combination of the components that produces the 3.5 @xmath0 emission can be expressed as a ( different ) linear combination of the 2.2 and 4.9 @xmath0 emission .",
    "the second change from the dwek & arendt ( 1998 ) procedure is that here we apply adjustments to the 2.2 and 4.9 @xmath0 spatial templates to account for extinction differences between those wavelengths and 3.5 @xmath0 .",
    "this correction is intended to make the spatial templates ( especially at 2.2 @xmath0 ) more accurate at low latitudes ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the extinction corrections involve the simplifying assumptions that extinction can be treated as a foreground screen , and that the intrinsic background sources have uniform color .",
    "arendt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have previously demonstrated that the near - ir colors of the integrated starlight measured by dirbe at @xmath6 can be fit very well making these assumptions . at high latitudes",
    "the extinction is so low at these wavelengths that the correction has no significant effect .",
    "thus , we represent the stellar emission at 3.5 @xmath0 as a linear combination of the extinction  corrected emission at 2.2 and 4.9 @xmath0 : @xmath7 e^{-\\tau_{3.5}}.\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the stellar component of the observed emission and the optical depth at the wavelength @xmath10 . with the use of an adopted reddening law to define the wavelength dependence of the extinction , the extinctions in eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the 1.25 to 2.2 @xmath0 intrinsic stellar intensity : @xmath11 this ratio of the two shortest wavelength dirbe bands is used because extinction will be strongest , and ism emission appears to be negligible in these bands ( arendt et al .",
    "1994 ; freudenreich 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the actual model for the stellar emission component is given by @xmath12^{\\alpha } \\nonumber \\\\ &   & + b i_{star}(4.9 ) \\left[\\frac{i_{star}(1.25)}{i_{star}(2.2)}\\right]^{\\beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are calculated using the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) reddening law , which has been shown to be a good representation of the extinction observed by dirbe ( arendt et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "emission from the ism , the second term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , is relatively faint at near  ir wavelengths , but it is not negligible at @xmath17 .",
    "our model of the ism emission is the same simple one - component model used by hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 100 @xmath0 ism intensity .",
    "this model is obviously a valid approximation at low optical depth , but remarkably this linear correlation is still observed to exist at very low latitudes where high optical depths might be expected .",
    "this is demonstrated and discussed in  6 .",
    "the third component of the observed emission , the cib , is modeled as an isotropic constant term .",
    "while the galactic stellar and ism emission components are modeled using their spatial structure , it is the _ lack _ of structure that distinguishes the cib . even though a few of the nearest , brightest galaxies are resolved by dirbe s @xmath20 beam ( odenwald , newmark , & smoot 1998 )",
    ", we expect that because of stellar confusion and instrumental noise , any detection of the cib will be isotropic to first order .",
    "thus , the complete model of the observed 3.5 @xmath0 emission is represented by @xmath21^{\\alpha}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + b i_{star}(4.9)\\left[\\frac{i_{star}(1.25)}{i_{star}(2.2)}\\right]^{\\beta}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + c i_{ism}(100 ) + i_{cib}(3.5).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the event that the extinction is uniform or negligible , the extinction terms can be rolled into the @xmath22 and @xmath23 coefficients , yielding the `` no  extinction '' model : @xmath24[noext ] in the following , we refer to this simpler , no  extinction model as `` model 1 '' and refer to the full model [ eq .  ( 6 ) ] with extinction as `` model 2 '' .",
    "if we had templates of purely stellar emission at 1.25 , 2.2 and 4.9  @xmath0 and pure ism emission at 100  @xmath0 , then we could plug these into eqs .",

    "the above expressions show that the unsubtracted backgrounds in the 2.2 , 4.9 , and 100 @xmath0 components of the models reduce the value of the residual @xmath30 from the level of the 3.5 @xmath0 cib .    for model 2",

    "( 1998 ) , the systematic uncertainties dominate the random statistical uncertainties in obtaining the mean 3.5 @xmath0 residual .",

    "( 1998 ) are equally appropriate here , and are reproduced in table 2 .",
    "detector offset uncertainties are negligible in comparison , and are therefore not listed .",
    "the 1  @xmath39 uncertainties in the new stellar and ism models are estimated from the maximum difference of the mean residual intensity of the various high latitude regions listed in table 3 ( see below ) . as in hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we take the quadrature sum of the zodiacal light and combined stellar and ism uncertainties to arrive at the total systematic uncertainties , listed for each model in table 2 . the scale factors ( weights ) that are applied to the zodiacal light uncertainties",
    "are the same as those used to scale each wavelength in the construction of the stellar and ism models .",
    "while the residual emission , @xmath30 , derived here is not the cib directly , it should still be isotropic because it is a combination of isotropic backgrounds .",
    "in fact , @xmath30 should be more isotropic than the actual cib at any single wavelength , because any structure in the cib is likely to be correlated between wavelengths and at least partially cancel in the construction of @xmath30 . therefore , following the example of hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we have examined several different means of assessing the isotropy of the residual emission . in all cases , the key issue is whether or not the data show only the amount of variation expected within the uncertainties .",
    "isotropy of the residual provides more credibility for the accuracy of the subtraction of the foregrounds .",
    "it is also a necessary condition for attributing the residual to the combination of cib backgrounds .",
    "the simplest test of isotropy is comparison of the mean brightness in selected patches .",

    "the patch intensities for model 1 are not quite as uniform as those for model 2 , but in both cases the differences are smaller than the expected systematic uncertainties .",

    "kolmogorov - smirnov",
    "( k - s ) tests applied to the distributions , indicate that the hqbn residuals are essentially gaussian for the new results with model 1 and especially model 2 , while distributions in the hqbs ( and for the dwek & and arendt ( 1998 ) hqb regions ) are probably only slightly non - gaussian .",
    "the k - s probabilities of the distributions differing from gaussian are listed in table 4 .",
    "the probability is that of finding a random sampling of the assumed parent gaussian distribution with a smaller k - s @xmath50 parameter than the observed distribution .",
    "a value of 1.00 is definitely non - gaussian ; a value of 0.50 indicates the distribution is indistinguishable from a randomly sampled gaussian distribution ; a probability of 0.0 would indicate a perfect gaussian distribution with no sampling variation .",
    "the tests above are necessary conditions for isotropy , but they are insensitive to any anisotropic structure that does not alter the mean level or introduce some skewness or tails to the brightness distributions . a simple means of looking for likely spatial structure is to check for gradients in the residual emission .",

    "propagation of the uncertainties indicates that this is _ not _ a positive detection of the 4.9 @xmath0 cib , and even the 2@xmath39 upper limits on the 4.9 @xmath0 cib are no better than those already established by hauser et al .",

    "extremely red  shifted stellar emission , on the other hand , would pose no conflict for the far  ir cib measurements ( fig . 7a , solid line ) .",
    "however , the intensity of this emission would be in conflict with the indirect upper limits on the cib placed by the tev @xmath56ray measurements and estimates of the cib fluctuations [ see hauser & dwek ( 2001 ) , and references therein ] .",
    "these upper limits are typically 5  15 nw m@xmath44 sr@xmath41 at wavelengths @xmath57 @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , the integrated intensity ( 1100 @xmath0 ) of this component would be @xmath58 nw m@xmath44 sr@xmath41 .",

    "the star formation rate would be lower if only high mass stars were formed , but the metal production is still directly linked to the luminosity density .    instead of implying interesting phenomena at high redshifts , it is more likely that the 4.9 @xmath0 rise indicates an incomplete subtraction of the galactic or zodiacal foregrounds ( fig .",
    "a galactic origin for the rise seems unlikely however , since it would require the 3.5 and 4.9 @xmath0 emission of the ism to have been underestimated by a factor of 10 or more , or it would require the presence of some unknown discrete sources with spectra that peak at @xmath69 @xmath0 ( @xmath70 k ) and a distribution that appears isotropic as viewed from the galactic location of the sun .",
    "the rise is more likely caused by unsubtracted zodiacal light .",
    "the zodiacal light spectrum is actually a suspiciously good match to the residual emission reported by hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from 1.25  100 @xmath0 , and to the near  ir cib spectrum reported by others .",
    "the elevated 4.9 @xmath0 emission should therefore serve as a warning that residual zodiacal light emission may also affect estimates of the cib at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is difficult to estimate because the zodiacal light is thermal emission at 4.9 @xmath0 and scattered light at shorter wavelengths .",
    "uncertainties in the spatial distribution of the dust may produce correlated errors at 4.9 @xmath0 and shorter wavelengths , whereas uncertainties in the optical properties of the grains may not .",
    "recent measurements of the optical extragalactic background light ( ebl ) by bernstein , freedman & madore ( 2002 ) indicate that high estimates of the 1.25 @xmath0 cib ( e.g. matsumoto et al .",
    "2000 ; cambrsy et al .",

    "lower limits on the cib that will be obtained through deep galaxy counts with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ space infrared telescope facility _ ( _ sirtf _ ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath0 should clearly reveal whether or not the cosmic star formation rate rises sharply at high @xmath71 ( fazio et al .",
    "studies of the relatively faint emission from the diffuse galactic ism at 3.5 and 4.9 @xmath0 require an accurate method of separating it from the brighter stellar emission . freudenreich ( 1996 )",
    "shows that emission of the ism can be traced to high latitudes using the 3.5/2.2 @xmath0 colors , which are relatively constant for the stellar population , but are redder where ism emission is present .",
    "arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) correlated the variations in the reddening - free near - ir colors with 100 @xmath0 ism emission to derive the 3.5/100 @xmath0 and the 4.9/100 @xmath0 colors of the ism .",
    "however , the derivation of these colors was restricted to very low galactic latitudes .",
    "now , with the models developed here , we can subtract the stellar emission directly , producing a map of the 3.5 @xmath0 ism emission instead of only an average near - ir color .",
    "the 3.5 @xmath0 ism emission derived from subtracting the stellar emission of model 2 is shown in figure 8 .",
    "comparison with the 100 @xmath0 emission reveals an excellent match of features down to the effective noise level of the 3.5 @xmath0 map .",
    "the linear correlation of the 100 and 3.5 @xmath0 emission is plotted in figure 9 for regions @xmath72 .",
    "the line plotted over the data is not a direct fit to this correlation , but rather the expected relation between the 3.5 and 100 @xmath0 emission implied by the coefficients of model 2 .",
    "the inset shows that this same linear trend fits all the way down to the faintest ism emission , despite the fact that the faint emission has relatively little weight in determining the model coefficients .",
    "higher latitude emission is all faint , and adds noise to the correlation at low intensities , but it still appears to follow the same correlation .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 listed in table 1 for models 1 and 2 , must be converted to the actual ism color through the relation @xmath73 because the observed 4.9 @xmath0 emission , used as a stellar template , includes weak ism emission as well as starlight ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "ism emission at 2.2 @xmath0 has not been detected and thus in not included in this conversion .",
    "the near - ir colors of the ism emission determined by arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are consistent with this relation for the coefficients of either model 1 or model 2 .",
    "the strong correlation between 3.5 and 100 @xmath0 ism emission at low latitudes as well as high latitudes indicates that , in the diffuse ism , the distribution of the very small grains or pahs responsible for the 3.5 @xmath0 emission is not very different from that of the larger grains which produce most of the 100 @xmath0 emission .",
    "previous studies by giard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and tanaka et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have identified similarly good correlation between the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature and 12 and 100 @xmath0 emission using data sets that were less sensitive or more restricted in coverage than the dirbe data .",
    "the fact that the correlation is so tight despite galactic gradients in the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , which varies in intensity by factors of @xmath743  5 on a scale of several kpc ( mathis , mezger , & panagia 1983 ; sodroski et al .",
    "1997 ) , may be explained by considering the heating of the dust grains .",
    "first , the 3.5 @xmath0 intensity of the small grains or pahs will be proportional to the uv intensity of the isrf , while the spectral shape of the emission is essentially constant .",
    "second , the emission of large grains immersed in the typical isrf peaks at wavelengths slightly longer than 100 @xmath0 .",
    "being near the peak of the planck function , there is a wide range ( a factor of @xmath75 ) of isrf intensity , @xmath76 , over which the quantity @xmath77 varies by no more than a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , over a wide range of isrf intensity , both the 3.5 and 100 @xmath0 emission are roughly proportional to the intensity of the isrf .",
    "detailed modeling of the emission by li & draine ( 2001 ) shows that the ratio of @xmath78 is expected to vary by @xmath79 for an isrf scaled from 1  30 times its local intensity ( see their fig .",
    "13 ) . because the large  scale variation of the isrf is only a fraction of this range , the ratios @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    "are also observed to be relatively constant , and correlations of @xmath82 with @xmath83 or @xmath84 are similar in appearance to figure 9 .",
    "we have developed an empirical model of the 3.5 @xmath0 galactic and extragalactic emission seen by dirbe .",
    "the galactic stellar emission is modeled with two spatial components .",
    "the galactic ism emission is modeled with a single spatial template . the residual emission after subtraction of the galactic emission is isotropic to a high degree , but without a significantly positive intensity . however , because our model uses the observed emission in other ir bands as spatial templates , the residual should be a linear combination of the cib at several wavelengths .",
    "existing estimates of the cib at 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , and 100 @xmath0 can be combined to derive a new ( but highly uncertain ) estimate of the cib intensity at 4.9 @xmath0 , which suggests that the cib intensity may begin to increase at wavelengths @xmath853.5 @xmath0 .",
    "such a rise in the spectrum of the residual emission after subtraction of the foregrounds may indicate interesting physics in the spectrum of the cib , but is more likely to simply indicate systematic errors in the subtraction of the zodiacal and/or galactic foreground emission .",
