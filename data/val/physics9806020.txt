    "weakly bound two- and three - body systems in low angular momentum states are spatially very extended @xcite .",
    "we shall call them halos , if a substantial fraction of the wave function is outside the range of the potentials .",
    "each of the constituent `` particles '' may be a composite system , provided it is a tightly bound structure with a binding energy large compared to the interparticle binding energy . then the corresponding ( intrinsic and halo ) degrees of freedom decouple and a few - body treatment is appropriate .",
    "prominant examples are the new class of nuclear states called nuclear halos @xcite and various molecular systems , in particular the atomic helium trimer @xcite .",
    "halo states are in general characterized by their large spatial extension .",
    "they could as well appear as excited states of systems which in the ground state are of a different nature and spatially confined .",
    "borromean systems , where no binary subsystem is bound , are particularly interesting three - body halo candidates @xcite .",
    "they have by definition a relatively low binding energy .",
    "many nuclear examples are available @xcite and until recently it was unclear whether the helium trimer was of borromean nature @xcite .",
    "the halo concept is general and of interest in different subfields of physics @xcite . in the simplest case of two - body halo systems universal relations between size and binding energy",
    "were discussed @xcite .",
    "also the general properties of three - body halos are intensively discussed @xcite    the halo structure is almost entirely determined by the tail properties of the effective interactions between the particles . if the finite - size particles have a substantially overlap , the halo degrees of freedom do not decouple and the few - body approximations are inaccurate @xcite .",
    "the effective two - body interactions should then reproduce low - energy scattering properties , i.e. phase shifts or it may be sufficient with the correct scattering length and effective range @xcite . for molecular systems it is possible to compute the two - body effective potentials directly from the electromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "the halo structure is technically difficult to compute accurately , since precise knowledge of the behavior of the effective radial ( three - body ) potential at large - distance is indispensable and at the same time the small distances , responsible for the actual size of the binding energy , must also be properly included .",
    "fortunately , a method treating the large distances analytically and the short distances numerically has recently become available @xcite .",
    "the method is very powerful as demonstrated by the succesful investigation of the patological efimov effect @xcite . within the method",
    "the faddeev equations are solved in coordinate space in two steps .",
    "first the angular part is solved for each hyperradius , thereby providing the adiabatic basis .",
    "this is usually the most difficult part , where semianalytic large - distance asymptotic solutions are employed . afterwards",
    "the coupled set of radial equations for the expansion coefficients is solved .",
    "another somewhat similar method was recently used to study the helium trimer @xcite .",
    "this method exploit the fact that the interaction ( in addition to two distance - coordinates ) only depends on one angle , since the three euler angles describe rotations of the system as a whole . in principle",
    "the same adiabatic basis is then obtained .",
    "however , the computations only include the lowest angular basis state which already seems to involve extensive calculations .",
    "the @xmath0he - dimer and trimer systems have recently been experimentally established as weakly bound systems although without direct measurement of the binding energies @xcite .",
    "however , the size of the @xmath0he - dimer was found to be exceedingly large compared to the range of the two - body potential . in the conceptually simple experiment transmission",
    "was measured through a screen consisting of holes with radii comparable to the dimer size @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of the dimer must consequently be exceedingly small .",
    "however , this does not constrain the binding energy of the three - body system which , due to the thomas - effect @xcite , still can be much larger than the binding energy of the two - body system . on the other hand , results from solving the schrdinger equation as well as momentum space faddeev calculations strongly suggest that the trimer binding energy indeed is very small @xcite . both computations",
    "conclude that the trimer has two bound states of which the excited state has the characteristica of an efimov state : when the attraction is increased it disappears into the continuum away from the discrete three - body spectrum .",
    "interesting systems can be formed by substituting one or more of the @xmath0he - atoms by @xmath1he - atoms .",
    "the electron structure is identical and the effective two - body interaction is then unchanged . due to",
    "the smaller masses the three - body states move up in energy and calculations predict that @xmath2he@xmath1he@xmath3 and the @xmath1he - trimer both are unbound @xcite .",
    "there is no simple relation between the size and the binding energy of these systems and detailed calculations of the three - body wave functions are needed .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is three - fold .",
    "first , we shall repete the investigation of esry et al . @xcite and",
    "extent it to include sufficiently many adiabatic basis states to obtain precise solutions .",
    "we shall keep an eye on the possible occurrence of efimov states .",
    "second , we shall define simple two - body potentials reproducing the low - energy scattering behavior of the realistic potentials .",
    "we shall assess the accuracy of such approximation schemes , which reduce the necessary computational efforts by orders of magnitude .",
    "third , we shall describe an improved method able to deal efficiently with large repulsive cores as traditionally used in the parametrization of the two - body molecular interaction .",
    "after the introduction we describe first briefly in section 2 the general method of solving the faddeev equations using hyperspherical coordinates . the angular equations and the effective radial potential at large distances",
    "are then analyzed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the rather delicate numerical procedure and the corresponding results are discussed in sections 5 and 6 , respectively . finally section 7 contains the summary and the conclusions .",
    "we shall consider an angular momentum zero system of three interacting inert `` particles '' , where the @xmath4th particle has mass @xmath5 and coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "their intrinsic degrees of freedom are frozen and only the three - body degrees of freedom shall be treated here .",
    "the two - body interactions between the particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath9 .",
    "we shall use the three sets of jacobi coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the corresponding three sets of hyperspherical coordinates @xmath12=(@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) defined by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the reduced masses of the subsystems in units of a normalization mass @xmath21 . the volume element in terms of one of the sets of hyperspherical coordinates",
    "is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the kinetic energy operator is @xmath24 where the angular momentum operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 degrees of freedom .",
    "the total wave function @xmath29 of the three - body system is written as a sum of three components @xmath30 , which in turn for each @xmath13 are expanded on a complete set of generalized angular functions @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radial phase space factor and @xmath34    the angular functions , the adiabatic basis , are now for each @xmath13 chosen as the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the faddeev equations : @xmath35 where @xmath18 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath19 .    the radial expansion coefficients @xmath36 are obtained from a coupled set of `` radial '' differential equations @xcite , i.e. @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the three - body energy , @xmath39 is an anticipated additional three - body potential and the functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined as angular integrals : @xmath42 @xmath43    explicit expressions for these coupling terms can be obtained by deriving eq.([e25 ] ) with respect to @xmath13 . by use of the normalization condition @xmath44 .",
    "we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 essentially is the sum of the three two - body potentials , i.e. @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath40 is antisymmetric .",
    "the angular functions @xmath49 are expanded in products of the three - body spherical harmonics @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the orbital angular momenta and their projections associated with * x * and * y * are @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the total angular momentum is zero and we get @xmath54^{00 }   \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a factor related to phase space .",
    "we can now insertion of eq.([e60 ] ) into eq.([e25 ] ) and obtain an equation for each of @xmath56 projections of each faddeev component : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the sum of the other two faddeev components projected onto @xmath59^{00}$ ] in the @xmath7th jacobyan system . i.e. @xmath58 is a sum of all the non - zero @xmath56 -contributions of the two other faddeev components .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61 .    when @xmath13 is large the potential is zero everywhere except for small @xmath14 .",
    "thus for @xmath62 the effect of the potential on the left hand side of the equation have to been seen through a centrifugal barrier proportional to @xmath63 and the effect of the potential on the right hand side is quenched by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "thus for non - zero @xmath56 all terms containing the potential can be put to zero for large enough @xmath13 .",
    "thus the free equation appear .",
    "so if any of the faddeev components have a finite contribution with @xmath62 for @xmath65 we obtain the free solution for that component with the free eigenvalue @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an even integer equal or greater than @xmath68 . again a detailed analyses",
    "shows that @xmath69 .",
    "this analysis is actually quite similar to the ones given below except higher transcendental functions have to be used in the derivation .",
    "if we now assume that all the faddeev components only have contributions from @xmath70 for @xmath65 we end up with three coupled asymptotic equations @xmath71 @xmath72 the short - range potential @xmath73 can be assumed to vanish for @xmath14 larger than a constant @xmath74 which for large distances must decrease inversely proportional to @xmath13 . the corresponding solution to eq.([e87 ] ) is then @xmath75 \\ ;     { \\rm for } \\ ; \\alpha_i > \\alpha^{(i)}_0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath76 is an arbitrary constants and the proper boundary condition @xmath77 explicitly is included .",
    "the function @xmath78 in eq.([e87 ] ) is only needed when @xmath73 remains finite , i.e. for @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath80 the integration in eq.([e87 ] ) only includes the region where eq.([e87 ] ) is valid .",
    "therefore as soon as @xmath13 corresponds to distances outside the short - range potentials we can rewrite eq.([e87 ] ) as @xmath81    the solution to eq.([e93 ] ) is given in eq.([e53 ] ) for @xmath82 and for @xmath79 we find @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the solution to the homogeneous equation @xmath85 with the boundary conditions @xmath86 . if @xmath87 varies within the interval @xmath88 the solution to eq.([e96 ] ) could be complicated and only obtained numerically . however ,",
    "if @xmath89 approaches a finite constant for small @xmath90 we find immediately @xmath91 for arbitrary constants",
    "@xmath92 .    assuming that @xmath93 is small for large @xmath13 we can expand the right hand side of eq.([e87 ] ) to leading order in @xmath14 .",
    "this gives @xmath94 @xmath95 the eigenvalue solutions @xmath96 to eqs.([e87 ] ) , ( [ e93 ] ) and ( [ e90 ] ) converge towards the hyperspherical spectrum as @xmath13 increases .",
    "due to the coupling the asymptotic values are now approached over a distance defined by the scattering lengths , which might be very much larger than the ranges of the interactions .",
    "the potentials @xmath97 vanish for large @xmath13 for all @xmath14 except in a narrow region around zero .",
    "the conditions for the effective range approximation therefore become better and better fulfilled as @xmath13 increases and any potential with the same scattering length and effective range would lead to the same results . let us then in the region of large @xmath13 use square well potentials @xmath98 , or equivalently expressed by the reduced quantities @xmath99 , where the parameters are adjusted to reproduce the two - body scattering lengths and effective ranges of the initial potential .",
    "the corresponding solutions are then accurate approximations to our original problem at distances comparable to the range of the potentials @xcite .    using square well potentials we can now easily define the constants @xmath100 such that the potentials @xmath73 for large @xmath13 are zero in region ii where @xmath101 and finite and constant in region i where @xmath102 .",
    "the square well solutions are then given in eqs.([e53 ] ) , ( [ e94 ] ) and ( [ e99 ] ) .",
    "we can also solve the approximate equation in eq.([e90 ] ) for both region i and ii .",
    "we obtain again the same solutions , where @xmath103 is neglected compared to @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the last term of eq.([e94 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath106 .",
    "matching these solutions at the boundary @xmath107 provides the quantization condition and determines the eigenvalue @xmath108 .",
    "also the decoupled equations in eq.([e85 ] ) for non - zero @xmath56-values can be solved for square well potentials . in region",
    "i and ii the solutions are proportional to the spherical bessel functions and the hyperspherical polynomials , respectively .",
    "all these square well solutions coincide at large distances with the solutions for any general potential with the same scattering length and effective range .",
    "however , when the two - body potentials are strongly repulsive at small distances it is an advantage to use eq.([e93 ] ) with the correct potential instead of both the square well solution and the additional approximation in eq.([e90 ] ) . a faster convergence ( for smaller @xmath13 ) towards the large - distance asymptotics",
    "is then obtained .",
    "the method described here is useful when the large - distance behavior is important . in extreme cases as for example for efimov states and halo systems",
    "the large distances are necessary and otherwise difficult or impossible to compute sufficiently accurate . for large distances , where the approximations become increasingly better , it is in any case much easier to obtain accurate solutions from the asymptotic equations than from the original integro - differential equations in eq.([e87 ] ) .",
    "thus we have formulated a convenient numerical procedure .",
    "the most important ingredient in the radial equation is the angular eigenvalue @xmath109 .",
    "we can extract the essential properties by analytical analysis of a schematic model . for simplicity",
    "we consider three identical bosons .",
    "we first find the square well potential @xmath110 with the same scattering length @xmath111 and effective range @xmath112 as the original two - body potential .",
    "the lowest - lying adiabatic radial potentials are then asymptotically close for the two potentials for hyperradii @xmath13 larger than @xmath113 . the large - distance behavior is essentially determined by the @xmath114-waves . the resulting eigenvalue equation , derived from eqs.([e53 ] ) , ( [ e94 ] ) and ( [ e99 ] ) , is a simple transcendental equation @xcite @xmath115     \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\sin(\\alpha_0 \\kappa )   \\left [ \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\sin ( \\nu \\ ; \\pi/6 )     \\cos ( \\alpha_0 \\nu ) -",
    "\\nu   \\cos \\left((\\alpha_0 - \\pi/2 ) \\nu \\right ) \\right ] \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .    the lowest - lying hyperradial potential in eq.([e30 ] )",
    "are to the lowest orders in @xmath118 obtained by expansion of eq.([e1 ] ) . for @xmath119 , where @xmath111 is the scattering length ,",
    "we find @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the solution to the efimov equation obtained by expansion of eq.([e1 ] ) in the limit where @xmath123 , i.e. @xmath124 in the other limit where @xmath125 we find instead for the lowest eigenvalue @xmath126    the effective radial potential is in this way obtained analytically for the square well potential for various distance intervals when the scattering length is large compared to the interaction range .",
    "however , as indicated above these results are more general , since they can be expressed in terms of scattering length and effective range , which are universal quantities characterizing low - energy two - body scattering properties of short - range potentials . for distances smaller",
    "than @xmath127 the details of the original two - body potentials are essential and the square well results are not applicable .",
    "this part of the potential is decisive for the actual ( small ) binding energy of the three - body system .    between a few times @xmath127 and a few times below @xmath128 eq.([e22 ] ) is valid .",
    "this region could be called the efimov region , since the efimov states appear here for @xmath129 where the radial potential in eq.([e30 ] ) behaves as @xmath130 .",
    "the lowest angular and radial wave functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are then obtained from eqs.([e60 ] ) , ( [ e53 ] ) and ( [ e30 ] ) as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the modified bessel function with an imaginary index . the radial function",
    "could easily be obtained from eq.([e30 ] ) in the limits where either the energy or the centrifugal barrier term is dominating .",
    "the same result is found by expansion of eq.([e78 ] ) for small and large values of @xmath13 @xmath135 where the zero point for the first oscillation in @xmath13 is assumed to be @xmath136 .",
    "the exponential fall off at large distance occurs for all bound states for distances larger than @xmath137 , since the effective radial potential falls off faster than @xmath138 .",
    "the number of efimov states is determined by the number of possible oscillations of the sine function within the interval @xmath139 .",
    "each new oscillation corresponds to another further excited state and the zero point for the @xmath4th oscillation is then given by @xmath140 the number of efimov states n is estimated from eq.([e28 ] ) by @xmath141 , i.e. @xmath142 the @xmath4th state has a radial extension of about @xmath143 , i.e. exponentially increasing with @xmath4 , and correspondingly an exponentially decreasing energy @xmath144 clearly infinitely large @xmath111 then gives infinitely many bound efimov states .",
    "they are extremly weakly bound and extremely spatially extended .",
    "efimov states may also be present in non - identical bosonic three - body systems .",
    "the condition is that at least two of the binary subsystems have bound @xmath114-states at zero energy or equivalently infinitely large scattering lengths",
    ". the third binary subsystem must be without bound states .",
    "a finite number of states with similar properties appear when the conditions are approximately fulfilled .",
    "the appearance is determined by the large - distance behavior of the zero angular momentum states .",
    "it should be straightforward to solve the equations of motion numerically .",
    "however , two major difficulties must be tackled .",
    "the first is related to the large short - range repulsive core where the wave function must be extremely small .",
    "the potential has an attractive pocket at short distances where the wave function also is small .",
    "these inner regions are where the potential is relatively large , are decisive for the energy of the bound states and the corresponding wave function must therefore be calculated with high accuracy .",
    "the second problem is that the weakly bound states are located far outside the range of the potential and the appropriate long - range part of both the potential and the wave function are therefore also decisive .",
    "a marginal numerical inaccuracy could be crucial for the number of loosely bound states .",
    "our first overall computing strategy is to use the faddeev decomposition of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the proper boundary conditions and the more subtle correlations are then much easier to account for in actual computations .",
    "the second computing strategy is to expand on a suitable angular basis for short distances and solve the large - distance asymptotic angular equations directly at large distances . in an overlapping region",
    "these solutions are then combined .",
    "finally the coupled set of radial equations is solved .    for short distances",
    "each faddeev component is then expanded on the hyperspherical basis @xcite .",
    "this amounts for each @xmath13 to an expansion in eq.([e60 ] ) of the functions @xmath145 in jacobi polynomials .",
    "the remaining expansion coefficients are functions of @xmath13 .",
    "the total angular basis then consists of a carefully selected set of hyperspherical harmonics with the total angular momentum zero .",
    "the basis is characterized by the faddeev components @xmath146 , the quantum numbers @xmath147 and the hyperspherical quantum number @xmath148 .",
    "only basis functions with the correct symmetry properties are included , i.e. symmetric or antisymmetric for bosons or fermions .",
    "when @xmath149 is small for small @xmath13 the angular eigenvalue equation eq.([e25 ] ) only includes the kinetic energy operator with the corresponding hyperspherical harmonics as solutions . in this case a few of the lowest @xmath56 and @xmath67 quantum numbers are sufficient in the basis .    for a repulsive core , where @xmath149 diverges ( or simply is very large ) ,",
    "larger @xmath56-values are needed in the basis to produce a vanishing wave function at small distances .",
    "the angular matrix elements of the potentials become large for small @xmath13 even for high @xmath56 , where the contribution usually vanishes due to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "a faster convergence in @xmath56 is achieved by subtracting a constant @xmath150 from each of the two - body potentials and subsequently correcting the energy eigenvalue by @xmath151 .",
    "this is simply a shift of the energy scale by @xmath151 .",
    "if the infinite basis is used the choice of constant makes no difference .",
    "a minimal basis size is obtained when @xmath150 approximately equals the lowest angular eigenvalue .    increasing @xmath13 normally decreases the required maximum @xmath56-value since the centrifugal barrier then increases . on the other hand larger hyperspherical quantum numbers ( or polynomial orders )",
    "are needed , because for short - range interactions the potentials in @xmath152-space become increasingly confined to a narrow region of phase space around @xmath153 .",
    "accurate wave functions in this decreasing region around @xmath153 require high - order jacoby polynomials ( high @xmath67 ) to reproduce the rapid change caused by the corresponding behavior of the potential .    in the limit of very large @xmath13 the hyperspherical spectrum",
    "is also approached for short - range potentials . therefore in this extreme limit only small @xmath56 and small @xmath67 are needed to obtain the angular eigenvalue spectrum . however , in the sometimes very extended transition region of intermediate @xmath13-values the eigenvalues are required with high precision .",
    "thus , increasing @xmath13 demands an increasing basis for an accurate description .",
    "it is crucial that this basis only needs to include high - order polynomials , but still only small angular momenta .",
    "the necessary basis can then be substantially reduced from the full hyperspherical basis with all @xmath67 and @xmath56 due to the use of the faddeev equations instead of the schrdinger equation .",
    "we shall treat large @xmath13 by considering @xmath114-waves , @xmath70 , without the further expansion on the jacobi - polynomia , i.e. we shall solve the large - distance equations ( [ e93 ] ) directly .",
    "moving towards smaller @xmath13 we must then find an overlap region where the large- and small - distance solutions coincide . to optimize computational speed and accuracy the basis",
    "must therefore be carefully selected to provide sufficient accuracy in the overlap region .",
    "when the asymptotic states correspond to @xmath154 the convergence is expected to be much faster and essentially reached already at small distance .",
    "we extrapolate the @xmath155-values by using the form @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a constant obtained by matching and @xmath67 is the asymptotic hyperspherical quantum number of this eigenvalue .    the direct way of calculating the coupling terms @xmath158 and @xmath159 is to perform a numerical derivation , but this numerical double derivative is inaccurate in regions where the wave functions change rapidly , i.e. for repulsive cores at small distances .",
    "instead we used the explicit expressions in eq.([e49 ] ) for small distances . for large distances we used numerical derivation for the @xmath158 and @xmath160 and a smooth extrapolation of the small distance functions for the non - diagonal @xmath159 .      in the actual cases of the he - trimer systems we choose the mass unit @xmath21 in eq.([e10 ] ) in the definition of the jacobian",

    "the numerical procedure and the input parameters are now specified .",

    "for @xmath190 the s - wave solution is accompanied by a higher angular momentum solution , which has converged to the asymptotic value 12(12 + 4)=192 already at about @xmath184 a.u . this level and that of @xmath191 avoided crossing at about @xmath192 a.u .",
    "the even higher lying levels are also degenerate corresponding to more than one totally symmetric state .",
    "the angular eigenvalue spectrum changes when the asymmetric @xmath193-molecule is considered , see fig .",
    "the interactions are the same as for the symmetric case but the masses are different .",
    "the number of levels is roughly increased by a factor of two due to the less restrictive symmetry requirement .",
    "the divergence for @xmath194 , the parabolic divergence at large @xmath13 due to the two - body bound state and the convergence to the hyperspherical spectrum at large distances are still the dominating features . compared to the @xmath0he - system",
    "we now find a number of additional levels .",
    "they correspond to nearly antisymmetric solutions in the exchange of @xmath1he and @xmath0he whereas the `` original '' levels also present for the @xmath0he - trimer must be of symmetric character .    considering the @xmath195-molecule obtained by substituting another @xmath0he by a @xmath1he - atom again decreases all the binding energies .",
    "we show the angular eigenvalue spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the usual features are seen .",
    "however , now the lowest eigenvalue converges to zero for large @xmath13 , since none of the two - body subsystems form bound states .",
    "the asymptotic spectrum is now reached much faster than for the two previous cases .",
    "this rate of convergence is roughly proportional to the sum of the three scattering lengths or more precisely @xmath196 ( @xmath197 is the scattering length of the two - body system with particles @xmath8 and @xmath4 ) , i.e. -2042 a.u . , -459 a.u . and 195 a.u . , respectively .",
    "the different rates are clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] especially when the range of the plotted @xmath155-values are considered .",
    "the levels all approach their asymptotic values from below , since the sum of scattering lengths in this case is positive , compare to eq.([e28 ] ) for identical particles for @xmath114-waves .      for halo states the decisive properties of the potentials",
    "are related to the low - energy scattering behavior or equivalently to the large distance behavior .",
    "this is formally expressed in the effective range theory where disparate potentials give the same low - energy results provided they have the same scattering length and effective range . since smooth and slowly varying potentials allow easy and accurate computations we adjusted the parameters of a square well @xmath110 , a gaussian @xmath198 and an exponential potential @xmath199 to reproduce @xmath111 and @xmath112 of the lm2m2-potential .",
    "the resulting parameters are given in table [ pot_fit ] .",
    ".strength and range arameters for gaussian , @xmath198 , exponential @xmath199 and square well @xmath200 potentials for the different he two - body systems .",
    "they all have the same scattering length @xmath111 and effective range @xmath112 as the lm2m2 interaction @xcite , i.e. @xmath201 a.u . and @xmath202 a.u . for @xmath0he-@xmath0he , @xmath0he-@xmath1he , @xmath1he-@xmath1he , respectively .",
    "the strengths are in kelvin ( 1 k = 0.0861735 mev = 3.16679 @xmath166 a.u . ) and the ranges are in atomic units ( 1 a.u = 0.524177  ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sizes ]    the ratio between the three - body radii of excited and ground state is 9.5 which only is two times smaller than the asymptotic prediction from eq.([e79 ] ) . in comparison",
    "the ratio of the binding energies is 52 which is about 7 times smaller than predicted in eq.([e83 ] ) for two efimov states .",
    "these observations simply confirm that the ground state does not have the characteristics of an efimov state .",
    "an additional ( second ) excited state ( which is impossible for this scattering length ) would have obeyed these scaling laws for radii and energies for efimov states .    the asymmetric system @xmath1he@xmath0he@xmath3 has only one bound state with both binding energy and size in between the corresponding values for the ground state and the excited state of the symmetric system , see tables [ he4results ] , [ he344results ] and [ sizes ] .",
    "for efimov states the product of the energy and the square of the radius should be a constant , see eqs.([e79 ] ) and ( [ e83 ] ) .",
    "this product is four times larger for the excited symmetric state than for the asymmetric state",
    ". the radius should then be about twice as large if the state should resemble an efimov state .",
    "however , this seems to be unlikely , since the radius is of the same order as the two - body effective ranges . in any case",
    "the interpretation as an approximate efimov state was already excluded in the discussion above .",
    "thus a pronounced halo structure is therefore a more appropriate description .",
    "the distance between the two @xmath0he - particles computed as @xmath203 is 28 a.u . and the distance between @xmath1he and one specific of the @xmath0he - particles is 38 a.u .",
    "the distances between both the @xmath1he-@xmath0he and the two @xmath0he particles are then two to three times smaller in this asymmetric bound state than in the bound @xmath0he dimer . as necessary",
    "both distances are in between the minimum and maximum of 20 and 46 a.u .",
    "again this demonstrates that the bound dimer - state is not a dominating configuration in the three - body systems .",
    "another interesting quantity in table [ sizes ] is the expectation value of the ratio between the smallest and the largest interparticle distance .",
    "first the minimum and maximum average distances themselves differ by a factor of two for the ground states and a factor of three for the excited efimov - like state .",
    "the ratio is nearly 0.5 for both ground states and 0.34 for the excited state .",
    "if the angular part ( including the @xmath152 coordinate ) of the wave function was constant this number would be @xmath204 . in the case of an efimov state",
    "this number was computed to be @xmath205 .",
    "thus the excited state does also in this respect resemble an efimov state . that the ratio is less than the value for an efimov",
    "state indicates non - negligible contributions corresponding to two particles in a bound state and the third particle further away .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the excited stated is larger than the dimer .    in all cases",
    "the simple potentials produce sizes deviating about 10% and 20% for gaussian and exponential potentials from those of the lm2m2 interaction . thus if only this accuracy is required the corresponding simpler computations are sufficient .",
    "spatially extended three - body halo states are apparently present in some of the atomic helium - trimer systems .",
    "the @xmath0he - dimer is experimentally established as exceedingly large and as a consequence it must also be very loosely bound .",
    "the large distances are then essential in any accurate description .",
    "the possibility of finding efimov states is adding interest in obtaining a quantitative understanding , but unfortunately at the same time emphasizing the practical difficulties .",
    "the necessary large - distance correlations must be treated very accurately without loosing the precision at smaller distances where the binding energy originates .",
    "this three - body problem is of quantum mechanical nature since the probability almost entirely is found in the classically forbidden region .",
    "we incorporate the correlations by solving the coordinate space faddeev equations .",
    "we expand the wave function in a complete set of angular eigenfunctions obtained by solving the angular part of the faddeev equations for a given hyperradius .",
    "this adiabatic basis is related to a set of effective radial potentials .",
    "the corresponding radial wave functions are solutions to the coupled set of radial differential equations .",
    "we first formulate this prescription in general and then the crucial large distances are specifically considered .",
    "only @xmath114-waves couple at large distances and this fact is exploited to derive simple equations with almost analytic solutions .",
    "a suitable numerical procedure follows from this formulation . for exploratory calculations we furthermore suggest a simplifying approximation where the `` correct '' potential is substituted by almost schematic potentials with relatively little loss of accuracy for the spatially extended states .",
    "the lowest effective radial potential is decisive and we describe a series of its large - distance analytic properties for a symmetric system .",
    "when the two - body scattering length is sufficiently large the efimov states appear as solutions .",
    "we repete the occurrence conditions and a few of the analytic properties of these exotic states .",
    "the strongly repulsive core is necessary in a correct description of the two - body potential .",
    "the numerical procedure is somewhat delicate and a sizable basis is necessary . each of the faddeev components is expanded on the hyperspherical basis .",
    "we need relative angular momentum quantum numbers up to about @xmath206 , jacobi polynomials for @xmath114-waves up to order 150 and significantly fewer for the higher partial waves .",
    "this numerical procedure produces the solutions at small distances up to about 100 a.u . and",
    "from then on we use the solutions obtained directly from the decoupled large - distance set of equations .",
    "the schematic two - body potentials are parametrized to reproduce the scattering length and effective range of the original complicated potential .",
    "we use radial shapes of gaussian , exponential and square well form .",
    "the solutions are much easier to compute due to the lack of hard core repulsion .",
    "still these simple attractive potentials reproduce the results of the `` correct '' calculations within 40% and significantly better for the spatially extended states .",
    "more suited shapes could certainly reduce this uncertainty , which in fact is remarkable for several reasons .",
    "first this demonstrates the importance of the large - distance behavior of the effective radial potential .",
    "second the error in binding energy by using such simple potentials is roughly the same as the results obtained by using only the lowest adiabatic potential , which carries more than 99% of the probability in a fully converged calculation .",
    "thus simple potentials could be exploited to gain even semi quantitative insight .",
    "we have essentially confirmed the calculations of @xcite using the lowest adiabatic potential . in our full calculations",
    "we find additional binding of 7% to 40% measured relative to the binding energy , which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the strength of the attraction .",
    "indeed these states are very weakly bound .",
    "we investigated the geometry of the bound he - trimer states .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0he@xmath207 is an equal sided triangle .",
    "the excited state of @xmath0he@xmath207 and the ground state of the asymmetric @xmath1he@xmath0he@xmath3 system are both also triangular but with sides differing by a factor of two to three .",
    "the excited state of @xmath0he@xmath207 has all the characteristics of an efimov state whereas the somewhat similar density distribution of the asymmetric state rather should be characterized as a pronounced halo state .",
    "more efimov states would only appear in the symmetric system when the scattering length is increased by about one order of magnitude .",
    "smaller changes would be needed to promote the halo state to the giant halo state called an efimov state .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have described a method to compute spatially extended three - body structures .",
    "the essential large - distance behavior is specially treated .",
    "we apply the method to the atomic helium trimers .",
    "the binding energies are accurately determined and the geometric structures are found to be triangular configurations .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0he@xmath207 has a triangular shape and the excited state is an efimov state whereas the @xmath1he@xmath0he@xmath3 bound state is a halo state ."
