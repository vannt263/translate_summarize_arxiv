    "a useful semiclassical formalism was described by minkov and savona in ref . to study @xmath2 qds coupled to @xmath3 electromagnetic photonic modes in an arbitrary dielectric structure . following this work , our starting point is the inhomogeneous wave equation for the electric field , with a polarization vector source that takes into account the linear optical response of the qds ( low excitation regime ) through a nonlocal susceptibility tensor .",
    "the electromagnetic problem is solved through the green s function approach .",
    "the field eigenmodes are used to expand the green s tensor in the resolvent representation , and the wave function @xmath4 of the qd @xmath5 is represented using a point dipole assumption , which is a good approximation when the electric field does not vary significantly in the region where @xmath4 is non - negligible .",
    "hence , the set of equations that define the complex frequency poles of the coupled qd - photonic system ( polariton frequencies ) can be given as @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the overlap integrals between the wavefunction of the qd @xmath5 and the field @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . in the present formalism , the transition frequencies of the qds are denoted by superscripts , while the photonic eigenmodes frequencies are denoted by subscripts .",

    "( [ syseq ] ) are the coupling strengths between the @xmath14th photonic mode and the @xmath5th qd , and they are defined as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an average exciton transition frequency , @xmath17 is the dipole moment of the qd , @xmath18 is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor and the @xmath14th mode is evaluated at @xmath19 , the position of the @xmath5th qd . to obtain eq .",
    "( [ gsdirac ] ) , we have used explicitly the point dipole assumption in the qd wave function , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 a normalization constant . from eq .",

    "we adopt such value throughout this work .",
    "the last requirement of the model are the values of the normalized photonic eigenmodes @xmath40 at the qd positions , and their corresponding eigenfrequencies and losses , which are computed using standard methods to solve pc structures . in this work",
    "we employ the gme approach @xcite , which is the best compromise between computational effort and reliable results for strong localized modes in high dielectric regions , as it is the case of pc dimers .",
    "the pc dimers that we address in this work are formed by two l3 cavities embedded in a pc slab with a hexagonal lattice of holes .",
    "the two cavities are nominally identical and have an outward displacement of the two lateral holes @xmath41 along the cavity axis , where @xmath42 is the pc lattice constant , and their radii are decreased to 80% of the surrounding pc holes radius , which improves significantly the quality factor @xcite .",
    "the l3 cavities are disposed in such a way that the line connecting their centers makes an angle of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , or @xmath46 with the horizontal axis @xcite , respectively .",
    "we chose the same parameters as in ref .",

    "we use a hexagonal supercell of superlattice parameter @xmath49 , and up to 11025 total plane waves tested for convergence in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 cases ; we use rectangular supercells of dimensions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and up to 11881 and 14641 total plane waves tested for convergence , in the @xmath43 and @xmath46 cases , respectively .",
    "since we are interested in the frequency region below the second - order mode of the homogeneous slab , we consider only one guided mode in the expansion but we have checked that adding a second - order mode does not affect the results appreciably .",
    "finally , the real part of the frequencies are averaged in the first brillouin zone of the superlattice in order to smooth out finite supercell effects .",

    "we see a very small splitting between the normal modes , which does not change appreciably with the inter - cavity distance @xmath54 ( defined from center - to - center of the two pc slab cavities ) .",
    "the behavior of the normal mode frequencies is quantitatively different for the other cases , in which a large splitting at small inter - cavity distances can be noticed .",

    ", both quality factors and loss rates , tend to the values of the isolated l3 cavity for large distances , as it is expected .",
    "the calculations shown in figs .  [ fig : pc - structure ] and [ fig : q - factors ] agree with previous work on similar systems  @xcite .",

    "we study the coupling of two qds coupled to the pc dimers studied in sec .",
    "[ dimer ] , using the formalism presented in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we consider each qd positioned at the center of each l3 cavity , which simplifies considerably the problem since the qds only couple with the @xmath34 component of the electric field .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath33 field component is negligible for small inter - cavity distances @xmath54 at the center of each l3 cavity , and eventually tends to zero for large @xmath54 values ( the @xmath65 is exactly zero at the center of the isolated l3 cavity ) .",
    "we also consider that the loss rates through the pc dimer modes are significantly larger than the qd loss rates @xmath66 through other channels , therefore , we set @xmath67 . with these conditions the @xmath35 matrix of eq .",
    "( [ effmatrix ] ) takes the following simplified form : @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polaritons](a ) we show the real part of the eigenfrequencies from diagonalization of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eff4x4 ] ) , for the same dimer configuration shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pc - structure](e ) and [ fig : pc - structure](f ) , as a function of the frequencies of the two qds at zero dot - dot detuning .",
    "we see that vacuum rabi splitting occurs in the frequency regions associated to the coupled modes resonances ( the vertical dashed lines ) , which is the signature of the strong coupling between the excitonic qd states and the pc modes . due to the opposite symmetry of the two photonic modes , i.e. symmetric ( bonding ) and antisymmetric ( antibonding ) , the relevant qd states in the coupling are the excitonic states with the symmetry of the pc mode . in this way",
    ", the first anti - crossing , which is associated to the bonding pc mode , corresponds to an excitonic symmetric state and the antisymmetric remains dark , whilst the second anti - crossing , which is associated to the antibonding pc mode , corresponds to an excitonic antisymmetric state with the symmetric one remaining dark .",
    "when the first pc mode is antibonding , as in the case of some configurations of the @xmath43 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 pc dimers , the first anti - crossing corresponds to an antisymmetric excitonic state , and the second one to a symmetric excitonic state , as verified in our calculations .",
    "the hopfield coefficients are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polaritons](b ) , and we can see an interesting collective behavior suggesting that a strong radiative coupling between the qds is present at each frequency of the pc dimer modes .",
    "in the region of the first strong coupling the polaritons 1 and 3 have comparably significant values of the coefficients @xmath73 ( qd 1 ) , @xmath74 ( qd 2 ) , and @xmath75 ( mode 1 ) , and we see the same behavior for polaritons 2 and 4 in the region of the second strong coupling , but now with the mode coefficient @xmath76 ( mode 2 ) , which corresponds to the antisymmetric mode . usually , it is very likely that two qds are detuned due to their inhomogeneous distribution of sizes .",
    "therefore , we show in figs . [ fig : polaritons](c ) and [ fig : polaritons](d ) the same analysis made in panels ( a ) and ( b ) but now introducing a finite and sizable detuning between the two qds , @xmath77 @xmath78ev . we see that under such conditions , symmetric and antisymmetric excitonic states are possible and the dark mode is not present .",
    "all the hopfield coefficients associated to the coupling of the qds with each pc dimer mode are non - negligible , and consequently radiative coupling between the qds remains present .",
    "we now try to give an answer to the question of how the radiative coupling depends on the inter - cavity distance in a pc dimer .",
    "the radiative coupling between the qds is quantified by the tensor components of eq .",
    "( [ gtensor ] ) , which are proportional to the green s function evaluated at the qds positions . since the qds are positioned in the center of each cavity , where the @xmath59 component is dominant , the dot - dot coupling is dominated only by the @xmath79 component of the green s tensor , which can be written for the two pc dimer modes as ( see eq .",
    "[ gtensor ] ) :    @xmath80    we plot this effective coupling strength in fig .",
    "[ fig : greenf](a ) for the @xmath44 pc dimer as a function of frequency , for all interdot distances studied in the present work . as it is expected , when the qds are in resonance with one of the pc dimer eigenfrequencies , the radiative coupling between the qds is enhanced and it can remarkably reach values on the order of 1  mev or larger . however , the dot - dot coupling strength at these frequencies is surprisingly minimal at small inter - cavity distance , which are the cases where the coupling between the cavity modes is largest . as a counterintuitive consequence ,",
    "the coupling strength between the qds increases with the interdot distance after the smallest values of @xmath54 , and remains relatively constant ( small oscillations ) at larger values of @xmath54 .",
    "this can be easily verified in the fig .",
    "[ fig : greenf](b ) , which shows the function @xmath81 at the values @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath81 evaluated at @xmath85 shows that even when the qds are out of resonance from the dimer pc modes , the radiative dot - dot coupling is significant and increases with the interdot distance . for completeness , we show the respective calculations for the @xmath45 dimer in figs .",
    "[ fig : greenf](c ) and [ fig : greenf](d ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath81 is very similar to the @xmath44 case , with the difference that the dot - dot coupling increases most rapidly with the interdot distance at small values of @xmath54 , and due to the small splitting in the case of @xmath55 we see a pronounced peak in @xmath81 at the mean frequency @xmath86 .",
    "it is important to remind that these results are valid as long as the pc dimer mode splitting exceeds the photonic radiative linewidth , _",
    "i.e. _ , where the mode splitting can be spectrally resolved ( strong cavity - cavity coupling condition )",
    ". qualitatively similar results have been obtained for pc dimers in the @xmath43 and @xmath46 configurations , respectively ( not shown here ) .",
    "these counterintuitive behaviors can be interpreted by analyzing the expression for the coupling constant @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ greeny ] ) .",
    "since the fields are strongly localized in both cavity regions for all inter - cavity distances in the strong cavity - cavity coupling regime , the functions @xmath88 depend very weakly on the @xmath54 parameter ; furthermore , the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are real due to the point symmetry of the structure with respect to the origin of coordinates , and have approximately the same value with opposite signs due to the opposite symmetries of the two modes [ see figs .

    "the curves were averaged over 1000 realizations for each value of @xmath97 , and the standard error is explicitly shown in the figure with the corresponding error bars .",
    "we see that the dot - dot coupling strength remains of the order of 1  mev for a statistical variance of @xmath10026 nm , which is comparable to the precision that can be achieved with modern sample - fabrication techniques @xcite .",

    "we point out that in the present analysis the qds are not necessarily positioned at the cavity centers , since their positions are generated randomly with a gaussian distribution , and consequently the qds will also couple to the @xmath65 component of the field . as a consequence , the other components of the green s tensor might be non - negligible .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath103 is much larger and dominates for the values of @xmath97 considered here . as a final remark",
    ", we notice that the results for the @xmath43 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 pc dimers are equivalent to the @xmath44 case , and coupling strengths of the same order of magnitude can be obtained .",
    "we have studied the radiative coupling between two distant quantum dots embedded in the two cavities of photonic crystal molecules in planar waveguide geometry , or photonic crystal dimers , by using a semiclassical formalism based on the green s tensor .",
    "the photonic eigenmodes are found by guided - mode expansion , which allows to estimate real and imaginary parts ( losses ) of the photonic eigenmodes , as well as the spatial mode profiles .",
    "specifically , we have considered two l3 cavities made of three missing holes in a triangular lattice , in which field antinodes occur at each cavity center where the quantum dots can be placed .",

    ", we have shown that the effective interdot coupling is enhanced when the qds are in resonance with either of the two normal modes of the pc dimer . under such resonance conditions , and in the strong cavity - cavity coupling regime , the interdot coupling strength is actually proportional to the quality factors of the normal modes ( bonding or antibonding ) , and it can be of the order of 1  mev for the cases considered here , which is at least an order of magnitude larger than typical values achieved in one - dimensional systems @xcite . since these quality factors can also increase as a function of the inter - cavity distance , tending to the limiting value set by the isolated cavity mode ( in the @xmath104 range for the present case ) , then the radiative coupling can also increase with distance .",
    "moreover , since the quality factors remain approximately constant at large distances , the radiative coupling can also remain constant at inter - dot separation that is significantly larger than their characteristic emission wavelength .",
    "in addition , we have also shown that when the qds are out of resonance from the pc dimer modes , the inter - dot radiative coupling is still significant and inversely proportional to the normal mode splitting between bonding / antibonding photonic states .",
    "eventually , the mutual qds coupling goes to zero when such normal mode splitting is blurred by their linewidth . finally , with a statistical analysis of the non - ideal positioning of the qds within their respective cavities",
    ", we could quantitatively conclude that with gaussian variances comparable to the precision of modern sample fabrication techniques , the coupling strength is not strongly affected and remains of the order of 1  mev .",
    "we notice that part of the conclusions drawn in the present work can be extended to any type of photonic dimer , in principle .",
    "in fact , while the mentioned 1 mev coupling strength is quantitatively valid for the specific systems considered here , it is still general the conclusion that the radiative coupling between quantum dots in photonic dimers remains constant even at significantly large inter - dot distances when two identical cavities are in the strong cavity - cavity coupling regime .",
    "in fact , this is the main result of this work , which can be particularly relevant in view of possibly realizing pc dimers with normal mode splitting resolved even at very large distances @xcite .",
    "the latter could definitely solve the issue of entangling distant qubits for applications in quantum information processing in an integrated photonic platform@xcite , where independent optical manipulation of the two quantum emitters could be straightforward if their mutual distance significantly exceeds the resonant wavelength .",
