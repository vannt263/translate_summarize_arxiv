    "another promising system for studying quantum transport in disordered environments and in the presence of nonlinearity are ultracold atomic gases . in these systems ,",
    "the disordered medium is produced by means of an optical random potential , and the nonlinearity originates from interactions between atoms . in this context , the particular problem of a bose - einstein condensate prepared in an optical trap and then released in a random potential has sparked considerable interest in the last few years @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of this type of experiment is that the time and spatial evolution of the macroscopic wave function of the condensate can be observed by imaging the atomic density profile .",
