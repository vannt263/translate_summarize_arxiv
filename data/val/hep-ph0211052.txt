    "neutrino reactions played an important role in investigations of hadron structure and determinations of basic qcd and electroweak ( ew ) parameters .",
    "recently , the feasibility of constructing future neutrino factories with intense neutrino beams was investigated in europe , japan and us .",
    "in particular , proton and deuteron targets will become available at these factories , so that the actual nucleon structure can be investigated together with the detailed studies of nuclear corrections .    in analyzing the neutrino - reaction processes , it is essential to use accurate parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the nucleon .",
    "the current status of art was summarized by stirling @xcite in his plenary talk at this workshop .",
    "it was explained that different pdf sets are constructed from available experimental data including the data for structure functions in unpolarized and polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) . due to the existence of various experimental data in the wide region of @xmath2 ,",
    "the unpolarized pdfs are now well determined from very small @xmath2 to relatively large @xmath2 .",
    "however , the situation of the polarized pdfs and nuclear pdfs is , in particular , worse than the one of the unpolarized pdfs . it should be stressed that these studies are really important not only for fundamental understanding of hadron structure but also for applications to the reactions with heavy - ions and neutrinos . in the first part of working group 3 ( wg3 ) parallel sessions",
    ", we try to understand the present situation of the nuclear and polarized pdfs , and then possible studies at the neutrino factories are discussed .",
    "the physics of various neutrino - induced unpolarized processes was also discussed at this workshop . because of planned huge statistics of unpolarized @xmath3 data with relatively low @xmath4 at the neutrino factories , it is becoming more realistic to investigate non - perturbative @xmath5 corrections to bjorken unpolarized and gross - llewellyn smith sum rules , and their comparison with available theoretical estimates .",
    "these phenomenological investigations are closely related to the problem of correlations between high - twist effects and the values of qcd coupling constant @xmath0 , which is extracted from experimental data in different orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the related experiments at the neutrino factories can put investigations of the role of twist-4 corrections and determinations of @xmath0-values from @xmath3 dis characteristics on more solid ground .",
    "more detailed studies of neutrino - induced processes can be also important for checking the predictions of the standard ew model and independent extractions of its parameters .",
    "a typical example is the recent nutev work of ref .",
    "@xcite , which reported that the extracted @xmath6 value from the ratios of neutral current to charged current dis cross - sections is in over @xmath7 deviation from the result of lep ew working group ( lepewwg ) .",
    "clearly , this intriguing situation is waiting its explanation .",
    "we summarize the presentations during the first two days of the wg3 parallel sessions .",
    "the discussions of nuclear and polarized pdfs are reported in sec.@xmath82 .",
    "the dis sum rules , higher - twists , extractions of @xmath0 , modified grv98 leading - order unpolarized pdfs and the status of nutev anomaly are discussed in sec.@xmath83 . low - energy neutrino physics was discussed at the joined sessions with the working group 2 on the third day , and this part is included in the summary of the working group 2 @xcite .",
    "the first day of the wg3 parallel sessions was focused on discussions of the nuclear and polarized pdfs .",
    "note that there are extensive reports on structure functions and pdfs at future neutrino factories by m. l. mangano _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and c. albright _ et .",
    "@xcite , so that the reader may look at these reports for introduction .",
    "there were three talks on the nuclear pdfs by j. g. morfin , c. a. salgado , and s. kumano .",
    "it is known that nuclear effects modify the pdfs in the nucleon .",
    "this topic has been investigated since the discovery of the emc effect for the structure functions @xmath9 in muon scattering . however , due to the lack of accurate deuteron data , nuclear effects are not seriously investigated in neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "if a neutrino factory is built , as discussed in this workshop , it could play an important role in determining accurate nuclear pdfs .",
    "the studies are valuable for high - energy nuclear structure physics , application to heavy - ion phenomena , and also neutrino oscillation physics .",
    "the nuclear pdfs have been investigated in the leading order by many people ; however , the first serious parameterization was reported by eskola , kolhinen , ruuskanen , and salgado ( ekrs ) @xcite . in the ekrs set , the @xmath2 region",
    "is divided into three parts . in the large @xmath2 region ,",
    "the @xmath9 data fix valence - quark behavior but sea - quark and gluon distributions are not determined . in the medium @xmath2 region , the @xmath9 and drell - yan data constrain both the valence and sea distributions . at small @xmath2 , they can determine the sea - quark distributions form the @xmath9 data , and the valence distributions are constrained by the baryon number .",
    "certain @xmath2 dependent functional forms are assumed in these three regions , and they are determined so as to agree with the @xmath9 and drell - yan ( dy ) data .",
    "the pdfs in the nucleon have been obtained by @xmath10 analyses of various high - energy reaction data .",
    "unfortunately , such a technique was not developed for the nuclear pdfs until recently .",
    "the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite are intended to create a simple @xmath10 method .",
    "used data set was limited to @xmath11 , so that the obtained distributions are rather different from those of the ekrs analysis .",
    "in particular , the small-@xmath2 valence - quark and medium-@xmath2 antiquark distributions are very different because the dy data are not included .",
    "after the publication , the analysis has been extended by including the dy data , and the preliminary results show a similar @xmath2 dependent form to the ekrs except for the gluon distribution at medium @xmath2 . at this stage , it is not possible to fix the gluon distribution in such an @xmath2 region in any case .",
    "these nuclear pdf analyses will not be developed significantly without new experimental data . as a new neutrino facility ,",
    "the fermilab - numi project was explained by j. g. morfin @xcite .",
    "the unpolarized cross section for neutrino scattering is expressed in term of three structure functions @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath9 , and @xmath13 : @xmath14 , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 of @xmath17 indicate neutrino and antineutrino reactions , respectively .",
    "the facility provides an extremely intense neutrino beam , and it is ideal for high statistics neutrino - nucleon / nucleus experiments . among many physics topics at the numi facility",
    ", it is a unique opportunity for investigating the nuclear pdfs , particularly , the nuclear modification of the valence - quark distributions through the structure function @xmath13 : @xmath18 = u_v+d_v + ( s - \\bar s ) + ( c - \\bar c ) \\approx u_v+d_v \\ .\\ ] ] it is predicted by the parameterizations and some model studies , for example , by s. a. kulagin @xcite that the valence shadowing is in general different from the antiquark one . in the first stage of numi , carbon , iron , and lead targets are installed , then the ratios @xmath19 and @xmath20 are obtained typically within a few percent statistical errors by the three - year minos run . in the subsequent stage , @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "targets are prepared to measure proton and deuteron structure functions .",
    "then , the ratios to the deuteron ( @xmath23 ) will be obtained to find the nuclear effects .",
    "this topic will be also investigated eventually at the neutrino factories .",
    "there are other interesting aims of the numi project , namely studies of quasi - elastics scattering , @xmath1 issue , polarized strange - quark and charm quark distributions @xcite .",
    "the details of the polarized pdfs are not known to the same extent that they are understood in the unpolarized pdfs .",
    "the reason is that a variety of data are not yet available .",
    "the data come from inclusive and semi - inclusive electron or muon scattering from the polarized proton , deuteron , and @xmath24he .",
    "however , they are not enough to determine the details of unpolarized pdfs , such as the polarized gluon distribution and @xmath2-dependent shape of antiquark distributions . nevertheless , in the case of polarized pdfs , the situation is better than the one for the nuclear pdf studies .",
    "indeed , there are on - going polarized experiments such as rhic and compass .",
    "moreover , several active groups for the global @xmath10 analysis are working in this area .",
    "the results of recent global analyses of polarized data were reported at this workshop by j. blmlein , e. leader , and m. hirai .",
    "the techniques of their analysis are almost the same .",
    "blmlein and bttcher ( bb ) @xcite , leader , sidorov , and stamenov ( lss ) @xcite , and asymmetry analysis collaboration ( aac ) @xcite have slightly different initial distributions : @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the corresponding unpolarized distribution in the nucleon .",
    "there are also other recent studies on the polarized pdfs @xcite .",
    "these distributions are evolved to the experimental @xmath4 points of the spin asymmetry @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "then , the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : initial ] ) are determined so as to minimize the @xmath10 value . in the updated analysis of the lss",
    ", the slac - e155 data are included by taking care of the positivity constraint and using updated values for the axial charges @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is important that the bb analysis demonstrated error bands for the polarized pdfs , so that the uncertainties of the present distributions become clear . in particular ,",
    "the error band is very large for the polarized gluon distribution , which should be determined more precisely by future measurements .",
    "an error analysis was also made by aac .",
    "the aac error bands show similar tendency ; however , the details are different due to the different choice of the functional form . for example",
    ", the gluon error is larger for aac than the one for bb .    possibilities of determining the polarized strange - quark distribution in neutrino reactions were discussed by k. sudoh , and charmed meson detectors were discussed by p. j. m. soler . semi - inclusive @xmath31 and @xmath32 production cross sections were investigated in polarized neutrino - proton reactions @xcite .",
    "four different parameterizations , aac , bb , grsv , and lss , are used for calculating the polarization asymmetry . because a charm quark is produced partially from a strange quark in the nucleon ,",
    "the studies indicate that the polarized strange - quark distribution could be measured by these reactions .",
    "experimentally , silicon detectors have been developed by the nomad - star group @xcite for the charm identification in neutrino reactions , and it was installed inside the nomad experiment . from about 11,500 @xmath33 charged - current events ,",
    "45 charmed mesons were obtained .",
    "the studies indicate that the silicon detectors could be used at the future neutrino factories for identifying the charmed mesons , so that they could contribute significantly to the pdf studies .",
    "the situation of the hermes experiment and possible neutrino experiments were presented by t .- a . shibata .",
    "near - future polarized experiments were discussed by n. saito .",
    "the hermes experiments measured semi - inclusive hadron production cross sections in polarized electron - nucleon scattering , and the data enabled them to investigate flavor decomposition of the polarized pdfs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the single spin azimuthal asymmetry measurements indicated chiral - odd distributions . from his experience of these experiments , he suggested that a future neutrino factory should have detectors with good particle identification in the final state for precise determination of the polarized pdfs .",
    "next , n. saito explained the present and near - future experiments to study the polarized pdfs @xcite .",
    "the present data are mainly taken for the inclusive structure function @xmath28 and some semi - inclusive reactions , so that they provide us a limited information for the gluon polarization .",
    "however , since rhic , hermes , compass , and tesla - n projects intend to measure @xmath34 accurately , the situation should become clear in the near future .",
    "in particular , he demonstrated that the rhic @xmath35 measurements provide a strong constraint for the gluon polarization .",
    "indeed , after including virtual rhic data in the global fit , the @xmath35 error becomes significantly smaller .",
    "in addition , the @xmath36 production measurements should provide a constraint for the polarized antiquark distributions .",
    "as for the polarized pdfs and structure functions at the neutrino factories , there were discussions by e. leader and g. ridolfi .",
    "there are extensive studies of polarized structure functions and polarized pdfs , which could be obtained from the possible european neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "in addition to the polarized structure functions @xmath28 and @xmath37 in electron or muon scattering , there are new ones , namely @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , in polarized neutrino scattering . in",
    "should be noted , however , that there are different definitions for these functions among researchers , and they are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the convention of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are related by @xmath41 in the leading order . neglecting the @xmath37 and @xmath38 terms by taking the high - energy limit , we have @xcite @xmath42 , \\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the lepton helicity , and @xmath44 is the difference between the polarized cross sections : @xmath45 with the proton helicity @xmath46 .",
    "the charged - current structure functions @xmath28 and @xmath40 are expressed in term of the polarized pdfs in the leading order : @xmath47 a combination of the @xmath28 structure functions becomes the flavor singlet distribution : @xmath48 where isospin symmetry is used for the distributions in the neutron .",
    "it is especially important that the spin content @xmath49 is found directly . in the present situation ,",
    "the spin content is determined by the @xmath10 analysis of electron and muon scattering data together with the first moments @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are fixed by semi - leptonic decay data . according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ds ] ) , we do not have to rely on such low - energy data . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the accurate determination of @xmath52 is not possible at this stage because the polarized antiquark distribution @xmath53 can not be determined at small @xmath2 from the present data .",
    "the neutrino reactions should provide valuable information on the spin content . combining these structure functions ,",
    "we obtain , for example , @xmath54 therefore , the first @xmath40 combination is especially useful for determining the polarized valence - quark distributions .",
    "furthermore , the second @xmath40 combination indicates the polarized strange- and charm - quark distributions .",
    "if the @xmath28 data are accurate enough , it could be possible to find the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the feasibility of measuring these structure functions @xmath28 and @xmath40 was investigated for the european neutrino factory in ref .",
    "@xcite , and possible errors are estimated in the region @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , g. ridolfi showed in his talk that the first moments of c - even distributions ( @xmath58 ) could be improved by an order of magnitude in comparison with the present uncertainties , whereas those of c - odd distributions ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) are determined at the level of a few percent . in this way",
    ", measurements of @xmath28 and @xmath40 should provide important information for the polarized pdfs .",
    "the second part of the wg3 sessions was devoted to the discussions of the physical information , which can be obtained from theoretical and experimental considerations of characteristics of unpolarized dis .",
    "these characteristics are related to the differential cross - sections in eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . because of the large variation of @xmath64 at the neutrino factories @xcite , it is possible to extract not only the standard structure functions ( sfs ) @xmath65 and @xmath66 but also @xmath67 from the cross - sections of eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) . this procedure might allow us to push ahead new qcd studies , which aim at a direct analysis of scaling violation in @xmath67 sf data . moreover , in addition to two well - known sum rules of @xmath3 dis , namely to the adler sum rule @xmath68= 2\\ ] ] and the gross ",

    "therefore , experimental measurements of these dis sum rules can provide useful information on the value of the qcd coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , while the existing sets of data for the @xmath76 sf , including the most precise published one provided by the ccfr collaboration @xcite , were already used for the extraction of @xmath71 at different @xmath4 bins @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of the @xmath4 behavior of @xmath71 , extracted from previous ccfr data ) , new experiments at the neutrino factories can give the possibility of the first measurement of the @xmath72 sum rule .",
    "it is interesting from the point of view of an independent determination of @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "this problem was discussed at this workshop in the talk of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that theoretical @xmath0 ambiguities , which result from the comparison of the qcd predictions with dis experimental data , and with the sum rules @xmath71 and @xmath72 in particular , are related to the uncertainties in the non - perturbative twist-4 corrections .",
    "they manifest themselves as the @xmath77-contributions to the corresponding theoretical predictions . in the case of the mentioned sum rules ,",
    "the twist-4 model - independent matrix elements are known @xcite .",
    "the problem of getting concrete numbers for these matrix elements was discussed in detail in the talk of weiss @xcite .",

    "the estimate reported by weiss also confirmed the results of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained with the help of three - point function qcd sum rules . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the errors of the twist-4 contribution to @xmath72 are playing the dominant role in the uncertainties of @xmath78 , extracted from the @xmath4-behavior of this sum rule with the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pdf set of ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , in the process of normalizing the theoretical expression for @xmath72 to @xmath79 gev@xmath80 and @xmath81 gev@xmath80 , the authors of ref",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is now important to fix in more detail the theoretical errors in the calculations of the twist-4 contributions to @xmath72 , performed by different methods in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the inclusion of higher - order perturbative qcd corrections into the @xmath78 determination procedures can result in the appearance of a problem of correlations between perturbative and non - perturbative qcd contributions .",
    "this property was discovered in the process of the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) fits to @xmath76 data of the ccfr collaboration @xcite with the nnlo corrections to anomalous dimensions of even non - singlet moments for @xmath9 sf calculated in ref .",
    "( the summary of more detailed recent nnlo fits to @xmath76 data @xcite was reported to wg3 in the talk of ref .",

    "let us return to the problem of parameterizing non - perturbative effects to dis sfs .",
    "contrary to the discussed sum rules , the complete form of dynamical twist-4 corrections in both @xmath76 and @xmath9 is unknown .",
