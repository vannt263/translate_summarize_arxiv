    "much recent experimental and theoretical work has focused on the electronic transport properties of nanowires , motivated by promises of novel electronic devices and the basic scientific challenges that they present .",
    "one of the key findings in nanowire devices is that the coulomb interaction plays a crucial role in determining device properties .",
    "for example , electrostatics in carbon nanotubes ( nts ) leads to unexpected behavior of intra - tube _",
    "junctions@xcite , of intra - tube schottky junctions@xcite , and of fermi level pinning at contacts between nts and metals@xcite .",
    "the importance of _ intra_-tube coulomb interactions naturally leads to the question of how _",
    "inter_-tube interactions might influence device behavior . answering",
    "this question is gaining increasing importance as experimental devices based on multiple nanotubes are becoming more common@xcite [ an example is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , and also to address the question of device packing density .    in this paper",
    ", we present self - consistent calculations based on the non - equilibrium green s function technique for planar carbon nanotube transistors containing multiple parallel nts . by analyzing the variations of the transistor characteristics with nt separation , we establish a length scale below which inter - tube interactions become important .",
    "while for small channel lengths this length scale depends on the channel length , for long channel devices it becomes independent of the channel length and is essentially determined by the gate oxide thickness .",
    "importantly , this length scale depends exponentially on the dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the nts , and can be substantially reduced by embedding the nts in a high-@xmath1 dielectric in the channel and using embedded contacts .",
    "figure 1(b - e ) shows the device under consideration : infinitely long single - wall zigzag nts laying on metal electrodes at their two ends and on a dielectric in the channel region . a planar gate 10 nm below the dielectric surface controls the device behavior .",
    "we take a spacing of 0.3 nm between    the nt and the metal or dielectric , and assume that the nt cross - section remains circular , a good approximation for the nts considered heredeformation .",
    "the electronic properties of the nt are described using a tight - binding approach with one @xmath2 orbital per carbon atom , and a coupling @xmath3 ev between nearest - neighbor atoms .",
    "semiconducting tubes are ( 17,0 ) nts ( band gap of 0.55 ev , diameter of 1.33 nm ) while metallic tubes are ( 18,0 ) nts ( diameter of 1.41 nm ) .",
    "we take the nt midgap as the energy reference level , and use a metal workfunction of 5.5 ev , putting the metal fermi level 1 ev below the nt midgap .",
    "the gate insulator dielectric constant is that of sio@xmath4    to apply the non - equilibrium green s function formalismdatta , leonardiccn to this system , we divide the nt in principle layers , with each layer corresponding to a ring of the zigzag nt .",
    "the main quantity of interest is the green s function @xmath5 , from which one can obtain the transmission probability @xmath6 and the zero bias conductance    @xmath7 de\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the fermi function .",
    "@xmath5 is calculated by solving the matrix equation    @xmath9 ^{-1}\\text { , } \\label{gr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the tight - binding hamiltonian for the isolated nt and @xmath11 is the electrostatic potential evaluated at the position of each layer . the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the interaction of the scattering region with the semi - infinite nt leads . in our tight - binding representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix elements for layer @xmath14 are @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of atoms around a nt ring ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 here ) and @xmath20 labels each of the nt bands . in this representation",
    ", we assume that the electrostatic potential on every atom of a ring is the same , a good approximation in this case since @xmath11 varies slowly over the nt diameter .",
    "the electrostatic potential is calculated by solving poisson s equation in three - dimensional coordinates on a variable grid with the source charge on the nt , and with boundary conditions at the source , drain , and gate surfaces , and at the vacuum / dielectric interface .",
    "this is done by combining a finite difference approach in the directions parallel to the nt and perpendicular to the substrate with a fast fourier transform in the direction perpendicular to the nts .",
    "once the three - dimensional electrostatic potential is obtained , the value for @xmath11 on each ring is taken as the average of the electrostatic potentials on the points on the nt nearest and furthest from the substrate , at the position of each ring .    to obtain the charge density , we note that our tight - binding technique provides the total charge on each layer of the nt , which needs to be spatially distributed .",
    "we assume a uniform distribution of the charge in the azimuthal direction , and spatially distribute the total charge in the radial and axial directions with a gaussian smearing function . the three - dimensional charge density",
    "is then given by @xmath21where @xmath22 \\\\",
    "\\left [ -(r - r)^{2}/2\\sigma _ { r}^{2}\\right ] $ ] with @xmath23 the tube radius , @xmath24 the position of ring @xmath14 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 the smearing lengths in the axial and radial directions respectively ( this expression for @xmath27 is valid when @xmath28 , and we used values of @xmath29 nm and @xmath30 nm ) .",
    "our overall procedure is to solve the coupled set of nonlinear eqs @xmath31 self - consistently for a given gate - source voltage at zero drain - source bias .",
    "figure 1(e ) shows the unit cells for our calculations to study semiconducting - semiconducting and semiconducting - metallic interactions .",
    "we first discuss interactions between semiconducting nts .",
    "the conductance of the nt transistor as a function of the gate - source voltage is plotted in fig . 2 for different values of the separation between the nts .",
    "clearly , as the nt separation is reduced , the ntfet characteristics degrade ; in the range of gate voltages studied , the current can not be completely turned on for the smallest tube separation , while the behavior in the off state is essentially independent of tube separation .",
    "this behavior arises because of the charge induced on the nts by the gate voltage , and by interactions between nts at the contact . as shown in fig .",
    "2a , the off state corresponds to the fermi level in the middle of the nt bandgap in the channel , with little charge on the nts , so coulomb interactions in the channel between neighboring nts are negligible .",
    "the on state however consists of making the nt _ p_-type in the channel by raising the valence band above the fermi level with the gate voltage ( fig .",
    "2b ) ; this creates a large positive charge on the nt which interacts with the charge on neighboring nts , and lowers the electron energy .",
    "this pushes the bands down , and reduces the conductance .    while interactions in the channel play an important role in determining device behavior",
    ", nt - nt interactions also affects the contacts . because of the mismatch between the metal and nt workfunctions ,",
    "contacts between nts and metals are governed by charge transfer between the metal and the nt , effectively doping the nt _ p_-type at the contact , with the metal fermi level just below the nt valence band edge in the contact@xcite . as the separation between nts decreases , the coulomb interactions between the positive charge at the contacts leads to a lowering of the bands ; at small enough separations , the valence band in the contact can be pushed below the metal fermi level .",
    "thus inter - tube interactions at the contacts can lead to modifications of the nt / metal contacts from ohmic to schottky .",
    "we find that this effect becomes important for inter - tube separations below @xmath32 nm ; the effects can be seen in the bottom curve of fig .",
    "2 , where the on state conductance saturates to a value much smaller than the single - tube limit because of the schottky barrier .",
    "these effects of inter - tube interactions on contact properties can be mitigated by embedding the nts in the metal contact .    to quantify the role of coulomb interactions _ in the channel _ , we calculated the conductance versus gate voltage for devices with different channel lengths ; we plot in fig .",
    "3 the conductance at @xmath33 versus tube separation , for several values of the channel length ( the smallest value of @xmath34 is large enough to avoid contact effects ) . the solid lines in the figure are fits of the form @xmath35 , from which we extract the value of @xmath36 at which the conductance decreases by more than 10% from its @xmath37 value .",
    "this length scale is plotted in fig .",
    "4 as a function of channel length , and delimits regions where inter - tube interactions distort the single - tube behavior . clearly",
    ", very short channel devices can have very high packing densities , while long channel devices are limited to tube separations of 15 nm . a notable aspect of the results of fig .",
    "4 is that the value of @xmath36 is independent of the channel length for large @xmath38 . at first glance",
    ", one would expect that a larger channel length leads to larger total charge on the nts and thus larger interaction energy . however , screening of the coulomb interaction by the planar gate leads to a different behavior , as we now discuss .    to derive approximate analytical expressions for the coulomb interactions between nts , we consider the simplified situation of fig .",
    "5a : a nt of length @xmath38 is at a distance @xmath39 above a metallic substrate held a potential @xmath40 , and carries charge per unit length @xmath41 .",
    "we use an image potential construction to calculate the electrostatic potential @xmath42 at a distance @xmath36 from the charged tube , giving    @xmath43    in the long channel limit @xmath44 , eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) becomes@xmath45the important point here is that in this limit the potential shift is independent of the channel length @xmath38 .",
    "taking a potential change of @xmath46 volts as a criterion for the importance of inter - tube effects , we obtain a separation@xmath47below which inter - tube effects become important .",
    "thus the gate oxide thickness @xmath39 sets the length scale @xmath48 . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath1 is the effective dielectric constant for the device geometry . for a simple comparison with our simulations",
    "we take @xmath1 as the dielectric constant of sio@xmath49 , and use the computed value of @xmath50 e / c atom in the on state .",
    "this gives @xmath51 nm in good agreement with our numerical results .",
    "a key point is that the length scale @xmath48 depends _ exponentially _ on the gate insulator dielectric constant ; thus , replacing sio@xmath49 with high-@xmath1 dielectric materials ( ntfets have been fabricated with hfo@xmath49@xcite , sro@xmath49@xcite and srtio@xmath52@xcite ) allows a reduction of @xmath53 to extremely small values , thus permitting high device densities .",
    "the general behavior of interactions between semiconducting nts can be understood from further analysis of eq . @xmath54 . near threshold ,",
    "the charge on the nt can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the threshold voltage .",
    "substitution in eq .",
    "gives@xmath57hence , the gate voltage is rescaled and shifted by the interaction between nts .",
    "this behavior is indicated in the inset of fig .",
    "2c , showing good collapse of the data after appropriate rescaling and shifting of @xmath58 .    the results discussed above focused on interactions between semiconducting nts",
    ". however , in multi - nt devices , there is often a mixture of semiconducting and metallic nanotubes .",
    "a question therefore is how the presence of nearby metallic nts affects the properties of the semiconducting nts . to address this issue",
    ", we performed calculations for the geometry depicted in fig .",
    "there , a semiconducting nt is separated from two metallic nts by a distance @xmath36 .",
    "figure 6 shows the calculated conductance vs gate voltage dependence for a 10 nm channel device .",
    "( the conductance plotted here is that of the semiconducting nt only . for single electrodes making contact to all the nts",
    ", the conductance of the metallic tubes would have to be included to obtain the total device conductance . ) the behavior in fig .",
    "6 is similar to that observed for interactions between semiconducting nts , i.e. a degradation of the characteristics with decreasing separation between the nts .",
    "however , because the charge on the metallic tubes is not strongly modulated by the gate voltage , the physics is somewhat different ; indeed , the metallic nts essentially consist of lines of constant potential . to their effect on the semiconducting nts we consider the situation of fig .",
    "5b , where a line held at a constant potential @xmath59 is above a metallic plane held at potential @xmath58 .",
    "solution of the laplace equation for this geometry gives the potential on the nearby nt as@xmath60thus the presence of the metallic tubes shifts and rescales the gate voltage seen by the semiconducting tube .",
    "for small separations between the nts , the potential on the semiconducting nt approaches that of the metallic nt , which is larger than that of an isolated semiconducting nt .",
    "thus , at the contact , the fermi level is pushed above the valence band edge , leading to a schottky barrier and saturation of the conductance to lower values .",
    "the behavior expressed in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) can be verified by looking at the off state behavior , and scaling and shifting the gate voltage appropriately ; the inset in fig .",
    "6 shows the resulting collapse of the data .",
    "in summary , we have shown that coulomb interactions between carbon nanotubes can have a strong influence on device behavior .",
    "below a characteristic length scale , interactions between nts can significantly degrade device behavior ; this can be understood in terms of a rescaling and shift of the applied gate voltage . for long channel devices ,",
    "the tube separation above which interactions between nts is negligible becomes independent of the channel length , and is set by the gate oxide thickness .",
    "this length scale can be substantially reduced by using high-@xmath1 dielectrics , due to an exponential dependence on dielectric constant . while this paper focused on the static device properties",
    ", we expect that interactions during current flow ( e.g. coulomb drag ) would also have intriguing properties .",
    "we hope that this work will stimulate controlled experiments to further explore interactions between nanotubes .",
