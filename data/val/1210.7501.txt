    "accretion of gas by gravitating objects is a common theme in astrophysics .",
    "the pioneering work in this field goes back the works of @xcite and @xcite , who analytically derived the accretion rates for point - bodies ( together known as bondi - hoyle - lyttleton or bhl - accretion ) .",
    "follow - up studies have refined these estimates , by considering the effects of the mach number of the incident flow and the equation of state for the gas , mostly for supersonic flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in astrophysics ,",
    "bhl - accretion plays a role in binary systems , star- and galaxy formation , and the formation of gas - rich planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the core accretion model of planet formation , planets start out small and rocky as protoplanetary embryos @xcite .",
    "once these embryos reach a size where their bondi radius @xmath1 starts to exceed their physical radius @xmath2 , they start to bind the gas from the nebula , forming a putative atmosphere . in equation  ( [ eq : r - bondi ] )",
    "@xmath3 is newton s constant , @xmath4 the mass of the perturber , and @xmath5 the sound speed of the unperturbed system . as accreting",
    "planets are hotter than the background nebula  either from infalling solids ( planetesimals ) or from the residual heat of their formation @xcite  the resulting pressure gradient prevents contraction of the atmosphere . therefore",
    ", the amount of gas these ( small ) bodies can acquire is initially limited : the protoplanet s atmosphere is in pressure - equilibrium with the surrounding nebular gas .",
    "small , hot protoplanets do not acquire gas akin to the bhl - regime : they must cool first .",
    "however , at some critical core mass @xmath6 the steady state picture is no longer appropriate .",
    "many detailed , 1d models have been developed to describe the quasi - static density structure of the protoplanet atmosphere and the cross - over point @xcite .",
    "this crossover mass is often quoted as @xmath0@xmath7 ( earth masses ) but its precise value depends on detailed atmosphere models , and thereby on the equation of state , accretion luminosity , and opacities of gas and grains ; it decreases to @xmath01  @xmath8 for grain - free atmospheres @xcite . obviously , understanding the processes that determine @xmath6 is of key importance for planet formation ; it may determine the transition between ( super)-earth / neptune - like planets ( bodies that have acquired limited amounts of gas ) and gas giants ( bodies that accrete gas in the bhl - regime ) .    in this work we will focus on the small planet regime , assuming a quasi - steady state .",
    "in a disc , the unperturbed gas flow , as seen from a frame rotating with the planet , consist of two components : a _ shear _ ( due to the [ keplerian ] rotation of the disc ) and a systematic offset , which we refer to as the _",
    "the latter arises from the slightly subkeplerian rotation of the gas , which is partially support by pressure . for a planet on a circular orbit , the value of the headwind is @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the disc radius ( semi - major axis ) , the corresponding gas density , pressure , orbital frequency , and orbital velocity . in this work",
    "the headwind is also defined in terms of a mach number , @xmath17 , i.e. ,  @xmath18 .",
    "only positive values of @xmath19 ( a headwind ; the gas rotates lower than keplerian ) are consider , but we remark that in special locations ( ` pressure bumps ' ) @xmath19 may reverse sign . in addition , the flow , as seen in the frame of the planet , is subject to ( noninertial ) coriolis forces and to the tidal force from the distant star .",
    "the flow pattern is therefore quite rich .",
    "understanding the flow pattern close to the planet is important for several reasons .",
    "for example , the flow pattern in the co - orbital region of the planet , where streamlines make a ` u - turn ' ( the horseshoe ) is a critical ingredient for the co - orbital torque ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . also , the location of the boundary between the nebular gas and the protoplanet s atmosphere is a parameter that affects the thermal evolution of ( growing ) protoplanets @xcite .",
    "the amount of gas that can be bound during the protoplanetary disc phase affects the long - term evolution of super - earths and mini - neptunes @xcite .",
    "the gravitationally perturbed flow pattern also affects the behavior of particles . @xcite and",
    "@xcite investigated the accretion potential of ( small ) particles .",
    "the secular particle - planet interaction has been studied more generally by @xcite .",
    "of special importance in the context of this work is the new ` pebble - accretion ' mechanism , where protoplanets quickly accrete small particles , as found by both numerical simulations @xcite as well as analytical estimates @xcite .",
    "the latter studies however did not account for the modification of the gas flow by the gravity of the protoplanet  the topic of this paper .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain a quantitative description of the density structure and the flow ( gas velocity ) in the vicinity of a gravitating body  in particularly , a protoplanet in a keplerian - rotating disc  and to assess the role of key parameters like : the headwind , shear , and planet mass .",
    "the low - mass planet regime under consideration is characterized by the following scale hierarchy : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scaleheight of the disc , @xmath2 the radius of perturber , and @xmath22 the hill radius @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 the stellar mass )  the scale on which the solar gravity rivals that of the perturber . at the lower range , @xmath25 , bodies are about @xmath26 km in size , or @xmath27@xmath28 @xmath8 in mass . with increasing mass both @xmath29 and @xmath22 increase , but the ratio @xmath30 decreases . at the high - mass end of inequality  ( [ eq :",
    "hierarchy ] ) @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to masses of @xmath010 @xmath8 , somewhat larger for the outer disc .",
    "one key approximation that is employed is to neglect contributions originating from the lindblad region , i.e. ,  the distance @xmath32 , where shock waves are excited .",
    "resolving the shock at these distances is important for calculating the torque that is exerted on the planets , which determines the orbital evolution ( migration ) of the planet .",
    "however , as an approximation for the flow close to the planets , i.e. ,  on scales @xmath33@xmath21 , @xcite argued that it is justifiable to omit the contributions arising from the lindblad torque region .",
    "that is , they showed that this procedure , referred to as ` torque cut - off ' , is permissible  up to levels of @xmath010% accuracy  provided that the softening radius , which is customary applied to smoothen the gravitational potential in numerical simulations , is chosen small enough . in this study",
    "no softening is present ; instead the numerical setup is characterized by a _ surface _ ( inner boundary condition ) .",
    "avoiding the softening is advantageous , since it is a parameter that , unless carefully chosen , could affect the outcome of the numerical experiment @xcite .",
    "these considerations imply that the flow past the protoplanet is subsonic .",
    "a further assumption is that the flow is two dimensional ( 2d ) , which allows us to formulate the flow in terms of a single scalar quantity , the stream function @xmath34 . employing the 2d assumption",
    "significantly reduces the complexity of the problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extending the stream function formulation to 3d configurations is straightforward for axisymmetric flows @xcite , but much more difficult  often unpractical  for truly 3d flows .",
    "similar simplifying assumptions are that the flow is inviscid and steady ( non - turbulent ) .",
    "these idealizations allow us to conduct a thorough parameter study for the flow pattern in the vicinity of the perturbing body , making a systematic investigating of the sensitivity of the flow pattern to the various parameters involved ( protoplanet mass , nebular headwind , equation of state , numerical parameters ) possible .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : streamf ]",
    "we formulate the problem and the underlying ( inviscid ) fluid equations . in section  [ sec : linear ] a first analytic model for the flow pattern",
    "is presented by a linear perturbation analysis . highlights the key results obtained from a numerical parameter study .",
    "a more complete analytic model is given , which describes the critical atmosphere region , under the approximation that the density is a radial function . in section  [ sec : p - traj ] the analytic model for the gas flow is used to numerically integrate trajectories of small particles in order to assess their accretion behavior .",
    "further implications are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "presents the conclusions .",
    "in this section the equations of continuity and force - balance ( euler ) are rewritten in terms of bernoulli s equation and a diffusion equation for the stream function @xmath34  the quantity that together with the surface density @xmath35 characterizes the flow .",
    "the numerical solution to these equations is presented in section  [ sec : simul - res ] and an analytical approximation is given in section  [ sec : approx ] . a key feature of the approach is to connect the local solution near the perturber to the unperturbed solutions at large radii  the far field .",
    "the far field flow pattern is assumed to be known and specified by the following constant quantities : surface density ( @xmath36 ) , sound speed ( @xmath5 ) , vorticity ( @xmath37 ) , and headwind ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the 2d shearing - sheet approximation is adopted , with the centre of the coordinate frame rotating at an angular frequency equal to the local orbital frequency @xmath38 . in the absence of a perturbing body",
    "the flow is , without loss of generality , assumed to be directed in the negative @xmath39-direction : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dependence of @xmath15 on disc radius , @xmath42 at @xmath43 .",
    "all subscripts involving ` @xmath44 ' refer to the far field ( unperturbed ) solution . instead of @xmath41 the linear shear can be quantified by the vorticity in the far field : @xmath45 in a keplerian disc , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the 2d stream function , @xmath48 , is defined such that it satisfies the continuity equation in steady state , @xmath49 : @xmath50 in the far field , @xmath51 is constant and @xmath34 becomes @xmath52 dividing the continuity equation  ( [ eq : continuity ] ) by @xmath35 and taking the curl we obtain the vorticity of the flow : @xmath53 where we used the ( general ) vector identity @xmath54 and the 2d - specific @xmath55 furthermore , the vortensity @xmath56 , is conserved along streamlines . ) . ]",
    "since @xmath35 and @xmath57 are constant in the far field , the vortensity is constant everywhere and @xmath57 can be expressed in terms of @xmath35 : @xmath58 and inserted in equation  ( [ eq : diffpsi ] ) to obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 in a keplerian disc ) .",
    "thus , @xmath34 obeys a diffusion equation in which both the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath62 ) and the source term ( the rhs of equation  [ eq : diffusion ] ) are functions of @xmath35 . if the background flow is shear - free ( headwind only ) the source term is zero .",
    "if in addition the flow is incompressible laplace equation is obtained : @xmath63 . for the general case ,",
    "however , both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are unknown .",
    "to solve the degeneracy between @xmath35 and @xmath34 , equation  ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) is supplemented by the euler equation ( force balance ) . in the uniformly _ rotating _ reference system that is considered here , the euler equation contains fiducial forces : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the combined gravitational potential ( of the planet and the star ) acting on the fluid element . the pressure gradient term @xmath66 is split into a global contribution , which gives rise to the headwind , and a local perturbation caused by the planet .",
    "the global term equals @xmath67 ( see equation  [ eq : vhw ] ) and is added to equation  ( [ eq : euler ] ) such that @xmath66 denotes the perturbation .",
    "in addition , it can be shown that the centrifugal force term ( @xmath68 ) and the solar force term ( @xmath69 ) combine into @xmath70 . since by assumption the flow is steady ( @xmath71 ) , equation  ( [ eq : euler ] ) reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 is solely due to the gravitating body at the centre of the reference frame and @xmath74 corresponds to the pressure perturbations induced by it . in the far field",
    "the lhs as well as the pressure and potential terms on the rhs of equation  ( [ eq : euler2 ] ) vanish ; and it can be verified that equation  ( [ eq : vinf ] ) is a solution to equation  ( [ eq : euler2 ] ) .    using the identity @xmath75 equation  ( [ eq : euler2 ] )",
    "transforms into : @xmath76 or , in terms of the vorticity @xmath77 : @xmath78 with @xmath79 the bernoulli function @xmath80 in equation  ( [ eq : bernoulli ] ) it was further assumed that the flow is barotropic : @xmath81 with @xmath82 the enthalpy . in the far field @xmath82",
    "is assumed to be zero , @xmath83 , and the bernouilli function reduces to @xmath84 where equation  ( [ eq : vinf ] ) has been inserted for @xmath85 .",
    "since the lhs of equation  ( [ eq : bernoulli ] ) is orthogonal to @xmath86 , it vanishes upon integration along a streamline .",
    "this implies that @xmath79 is conserved along streamlines ( bernoulli equation ) . to find the relation between @xmath79 and @xmath34 , equation  ( [ eq : continuity ] )",
    "is inserted into equation  ( [ eq : bernoulli ] ) .",
    "the lhs of equation  ( [ eq : bernoulli ] ) is then written in terms of @xmath34 : @xmath87 where equation  ( [ eq : vorticity ] ) and are used .",
    "as @xmath88 and @xmath36 are constant , equation  ( [ eq : psiblink ] ) simply implies that @xmath79 is a linear function of @xmath34 : @xmath89 where the integration constant has been defined such that @xmath90 ( equation  [ eq : binf ] ) .",
    "together , equations  ( [ eq : bconstant ] ) , ( [ eq : bnew ] ) provide a second relation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath91      -axis : the dimensionless hill radius @xmath92 as function of mass parameter @xmath93 ( solid line ) .",

    "particle trajectories will deviate from those of the gas ( the streamlines ) due to their inertia .",
    "that is , it takes a solid particle a characteristic time  the friction or stopping time @xmath338  to align its motion with that of the gas .",
    "the dimensionless equivalent to @xmath338 is @xmath339 .",
    "big particles ( @xmath340 ) like km - size planetesimals experience the gas only in the form of a small perturbation , which none the less is important to damp the random motions ( eccentricity ) of these bodies . here , we consider small particles of @xmath341 .",
    "to first approximation , they tend to follow the gas .",
    "however , their not fully perfect coupling to the gas causes them to slowly settle due to the gravitational force , e.g. ,  towards the central star @xcite or to planets @xcite .",
    "the particle size @xmath342 adds another dimension to the parameter space ( along with @xmath94 and @xmath231 ) and it is left to a follow - up work to conduct a full exploration .",
    "figure  [ fig : p - traj ] only presents a preview , where particle trajectories  _ not _ gas streamlines  are plotted for @xmath124 , @xmath159 and @xmath343 , and @xmath344 .",

    "[ fig : p - traj ] each curve represents a trajectory of a single particle .",
    "we have omitted drawing arrows to indicate their directions ; but these are clear from comparison to fig .  [",
    "fig : mixed3]b and e. highlighted curves indicate particles that are accreted by the protoplanet .",
    "they all settle to the planet due to inspiraling motion in the prograde manner .",
    "this means that the accretion rate only depends on the mass of the planet , not on its radius .",
    "this accretion mechanism qualitatively differs from the way planetesimals are accreted , where one relies on a sufficiently close encounter to ` hit ' the target .",
    "accretion through settling may provide a very fast channel for growth .",
    "for @xmath350 particles it has already been shown that their accretion radii are on the order of the hill radius @xcite . however , for smaller particles accretion cross sections are likely smaller since they couple more strongly to the gas .    indeed ,",
    "[ fig : p - traj]a , d shows that the @xmath351 particles are difficult to accrete since their trajectories are strongly tied to the gas .",
    "the particle trajectories in these figures strongly resemble the gas streamlines of fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed3 ] . in both fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj]a , d only two particle streams penetrate the planet s atmosphere and settle slowly towards the center ( at some point when it is clear that the particle will be accreted , the integration is stopped ) .",
    "most particles that approach the planet , however , can not break through the atmosphere as they , being strongly coupled to the gas , are dragged along gas streamlines .",
    "@xcite introduced the wind - shearing radius @xmath352 to quantify the competing effects of the ( central ) gravitational two body force and the gas drag force ( which pulls particle away from accretion ) .",
    "that is , only particles with impact parameters less than @xmath352 can be accreted .",
    "a similar wind - shearing radius can be defined for low - mass planets surrounded by an atmosphere .",
    "first , it is noted that only particles near the atmosphere boundary will be accreted .",
    "therefore , particles traveling along the @xmath260 streamline are most likely to be accreted .",
    "the wind - shearing radius then becomes the bandwidth @xmath353 over which the gravitational pull of the planet is sufficient to drag them into the atmosphere region .",
    "this idea will be explored further in a follow - up work .",
    "since the drag force equals @xmath354 , its influence will decrease with increasing friction time . for particles of friction time @xmath355 ( the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj ] ) more particles accrete , but more so for the headwind case ( 7 counts ) than the @xmath159 case ( 4 ) .",
    "even for particle streams that do not accrete , deviations from the gas streamlines can be noted in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj]b and e. for the @xmath356 particles in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj]c and f the deviation from the streamlines is much more evident ; close to the planet these particles decouple from the gas and the impact parameter for accretion is very large .",
    "note finally that due to the prograde rotation of the gas in the atmosphere , small particles that enter the atmosphere will also start to rotate in a prograde manner ; and once they have settled towards the central object they will convey this angular momentum to the accreting body , causing it to spin up .",
    "small - particle accretion therefore naturally explains the observed preference for prograde spins of solar system bodies @xcite .",
    "obviously , fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj ] only presents a small subset of the parameter space and the above argumentation is rather qualitative . in a future work",
    "we will return to the question of the efficiency of small particle accretion and a provide a more quantitative analysis .",
    "we have described a method to compute the gas flow around gravitating bodies in steady state .",
    "the idea of the adopted approach is to solve for the stream function @xmath34  a scalar quantity which fully describes the flow in 2d .",
    "the global flow pattern agrees well with previous numerical studies .",
    "however , the method employs several idealizations ( the flow must be inviscid , 2d , barotropic , subsonic , etc ) , and it would be interesting to investigate whether these conditions can be relaxed .",
    "we remark that a supersonic expansion of the method has already been presented by @xcite , which would allow us to explore particle accretion for more massive planets .",
    "since the focus of this work lies on embedded planets , an extension to three dimensions is perhaps the most obvious avenue . indeed , 3d effects could have some effects , e.g. ,  with regard to the width of the horseshoe region @xcite .",
    "although the stream function formulation can be easily generalized to axisymmetric configurations @xcite , it is not commonly used for truly 3d geometries , like the shear flow consider in this work .",
    "but if we pursue this path , the 3d equivalent to equation  ( [ eq : continuity ] ) reads : @xmath357 where @xmath358 is a second stream function . in 2d @xmath359 recovers equation  ( [ eq : continuity ] ) . in 3d ,",
    "constants of @xmath34 and @xmath360 constitute surfaces , and the intersections of two surfaces defines a streamline . following the procedure similar to section  [ sec : streamf ]",
    "we can obtain a set of diffusion equations , one for each component of the vorticity .",
    "unfortunately , the diffusion equations are now functions of two scalar quantities ( @xmath34 and @xmath360 ) and therefore require a much more complex procedure to solve , probably involving an iterative approach .",
    "a quite general , and somewhat surprising , feature of the numerical model is its sensitivity to the outer boundary constraints ( bc ) .",
    "here , we have used the linear solution presented in section  [ sec : linear ] to provide the flow velocity at the outer boundary .",
    "this turns out rather well , since the flow pattern is not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath191 , although we found that the atmosphere region converges only for large @xmath191 ( requiring high numerical resolution ) .",
    "however , if the flow quantities at the outer boundary is changed to the background flow pattern , @xmath141 , omitting @xmath148which means there is that @xmath361 by construction ",
    "it is found that the flow pattern is very different . in some cases",
    "even retrograde rotation around the perturber is observed .    since the linear solution that we presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hs - orbits ] agrees with previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have confidence in the robustness of the nonlinear calculations that we derived in the later sections . however , we have neglected possible contributions of the spiral density wave , i.e. ,  from the lindblad torque region .",
    "@xcite considered the effect of the lindblad torque ( which originates at distances @xmath362 ) on the flow in the vicinity of the protoplanet .",
    "they found that is was justified to neglect the lindblad torque in the limit of zero softening of the gravitational potential ( like in this work ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthwhile to include the effects from the linear density wave theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a boundary constraint , and to assess how this affects the flow structure near the planet .      the laminar approximation  and the neglect of turbulence  is another caveat .",
    "one stability criterion is the richardson number , which measures the stability of a stratified flow : @xmath363 where @xmath364 is the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "richardson numbers below a critical value , @xmath365 , indicate that the kinetic energy term due to shear will outweigh the ( stabilizing ) term due to density stratification .",
    "the flow then overturns and becomes unstable .",
    "we have calculated the richardson number for the simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed3 ] . in the far field ( @xmath366 )",
    "it was found that @xmath367 ; but this is due to our initial setup , where @xmath36 is constant ( allowing for gradients in @xmath36 and other background quantities [ @xmath368 , @xmath5 ] would be another obvious extension of the method . )",
    "however , ri increases with decreasing @xmath144 and closer to the planet @xmath370 .",
    "other instabilities may still operate though .",
    "for example , the flow within the atmosphere may be convectively unstable .",
    "flow past bodies characterized by large reynolds numbers will generally become turbulent in the wake of the body .",
    "vortices may develop along the horseshoe streamline @xcite . or the gas may just be simply unstable to start with , e.g. ,  due to the magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "all these effects render the laminar approximation rather fragile .",
    "but it would be difficult , if not impossible , to present an analytic framework for non - steady flow .",
    "our calculations provide the first order effect against which more specific simulations can be contrasted .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj ] shows the first - order effect of the interaction of particle with gas . turbulence will change the particle trajectories ; but , although their individual trajectories can be very different , it is yet to be shown that turbulent motions will result in a significant deviation to the _ time - averaged _ accretion rate .",
    "notwithstanding the canonical scenario @xcite , where protoplanetary cores are thought to be built up from big km - size ( or larger ) planetesimals , protoplanetary growth may in reality be driven by small particles , because :    1 .",
    "planetesimals will grind themselves down , before an embryo can accrete them @xcite or be trapped in resonances ( and subsequently be ground down ; @xcite ) .",
    "( sub)mm - observations imply that a large reservoir of the dust is typically observed in the @xmath0mm / cm - size range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   growth by ( big ) planetesimals is slow .",
    "this is due to the negative feedback of a growing embryo on the planetesimal population ( i.e. ,  it excites them to large eccentricity , rendering growth less efficient ; e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    for these reasons ,",
    "it is relevant to study in greater detail the interaction between small particle and embryo . in a follow - up work",
    "we will perform a quantitative ( parameter ) study to obtain the accretion potential of small particles . however , from fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj ] two trends become clear .",
    "first , very small particles ( i.e. ,  dust ) do not make formidable building blocks .",
    "they just follow the streamlines of the gas , and will only accrete on to the planet if the gas does not so as well .",
    "secondly , accretion rates rise steeply with particle size . in a recent study",
    ", @xcite showed that a putative core accretes @xmath371 pebbles very rapidly with impact radii approaching the hill radius , consistent with the findings in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - traj]c and f ( the scale of the panels is the hill radius ) . that this pebble accretion scenario results in high accretion rates is now widely recognized and may serve as an alternative to ( the much slower ) planetesimal accretion .",
    "however , one must not forget that @xmath372 particle also _ drift _ the fastest @xcite ; they may be removed from the system before they encounter a protoplanet @xcite . in this regard , somewhat smaller particles may offer a better channel for growth ( see @xcite for an assessment of the combined effects that affect the accretion behavior of small particles ) .",
    "protoplanets can also grow by contracting their atmospheres , allowing more gas to become bound . in this study",
    "this effect was crudely reflected by the transition density parameter @xmath118 : the higher @xmath118 the further the isothermal regime penetrates , and the more massive the atmosphere .",
    "more realistically , the atmosphere mass @xmath373 is a function of the ( solid and gas ) opacity , accretion rate , equation of state , etc , and is obtained by solving the full equations of stellar structure @xcite .",
    "these calculations are usually carried out in 1d , assuming radial symmetry .",
    "but it is only through multidimensional ( preferable 3d ) studies that a true assessment of the _ boundary _ between the atmosphere and nebula gas can be obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this work we find that the headwind plays a critical role .",
    "a headwind renders the flow  and therefore the atmosphere ",
    "asymmetrical , see e.g. ,  fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed]c , which causes nebular material to penetrate the atmosphere within a fraction of the bondi radius .",
    "the consequences of the asymmetry and , in particular , the small atmosphere radius have yet to be addressed by protoplanet atmosphere models .",
    "we remark that , although the importance of the asymmetry increases with increasing @xmath19 , it is a general feature  seen also at low headwinds .",
    "in this manuscript the inviscid , steady state solution of a subsonic flow past gravitating bodies was considered .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : linear ] , an approximate but analytic solution was presented .",
    "this solution only holds in the linear regime , that is , at distances much larger than the bondi radius @xmath29 .",
    "the linear solution served as a boundary condition for the full ( non - linear ) numerical calculations ( section  [ sec : simul - res ] ) .",
    "these showed the importance of the atmosphere region ( a nonlinear phenomenon ) , where the flow curls around the planet in the prograde direction . using the findings from the numerical simulations",
    ", we next constructed a more complete analytical approximation of the flow pattern , which captures the dynamics of the atmosphere region ( section  [ sec : approx ] ) .",
    "this solution very well matches the numerical findings and may be used in subsequent studies for which the flow pattern at scales of @xmath29 is important .",
    "the adopted framework is quite general , with parameters describing the mass of the perturber , the headwind velocity @xmath19 , and the shear parameter @xmath37 .",
    "apart from section  [ sec : hw - only ] , this study has focused on the flow pattern past small planets embedded in keplerian discs ( @xmath374 ) . however , flow patterns around ` bodies ' occur in diverse astrophysical settings , e.g. ,  in ( small ) satellites embedded circumplanetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , star formation @xcite , or accretion disks around black holes @xcite .",
    "as long as these embedded objects do not open gaps and the system is in steady - state , the framework constructed in this paper also provides a description for the flow pattern in these environments .",
    "the key findings of this study are the following :    1 .   for flows without shear",
    ", the steady - state flow pattern resembles that of an hourglass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : headw ] ) , where gravity focuses the streamlines .",
    "2 .   for keplerian",
    "shear flows the vorticity , which is amplified near the planet due to conservation of vortensity , plays the dominant role .",
    "there is a point in the simulation where the flow stagnates . in general",
    "there are two solutions for the associated stagnation streamline  one defining the atmosphere region and one defining the horseshoe region  which only coincide when @xmath261 .",
    "3 .   for the ( general ) @xmath375 case , the boundary of the atmosphere is asymmetric and lies within the bondi sphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atm ] ) .",
    "the size of the atmosphere reduces with increasing headwind but its averaged radius is best approximated by the bondi radius @xmath29 ( rather than the hill radius ) .",
    "4 .   when the flow is subsonic ( in particularly , @xmath376 )",
    ", the density near the bondi radius can be well approximated by the hydrostatic solution , such that @xmath35 becomes a function of radius only . in this approximation , an analytic solution for the stream function has been obtained ( see section  [ sec : approx ] and ) .",
    "this solution can be used to compute the gas drag force which solid particles experience during their encounter with the planet .",
    "when they can penetrate the atmosphere region , particles can be accreted as they settle to the planet through the circumplanetary disc .",
    "accretion of small particles ( dust ) is suppressed as they strongly couple to the gas flow , but we find that for @xmath0mm - size and larger particles accretion rates should be high .",
    "there is also tentative evidence that a ( moderate ) headwind accelerates particle sweepup , due to the smaller atmosphere .",
    "this work has profited immensely from discussion with many colleagues , including : eugene chiang , gennaro , dangelo , kees dullemond , anders johansen , hiroshi kobayshi , don korycansky , christoph mordasini , ruth murray - clay , satoshi okuzumi , ryan oleary , sijme - jan paardekooper , jiming shi , hidekazu tanaka , takayuki tanigawa , neal turner , and others .",
