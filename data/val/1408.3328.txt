    "[ intro ] the numerical solution of singularly perturbed problems has been studied extensively over the last decades ( see , e.g. , the books @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these problems typically feature boundary layers ( and , more generally , also internal layers ) .",
    "their resolution requires the use of strongly refined , layer - adapted meshes . in the context of fixed order methods ,",
    "well - known representatives of such meshes include the bakhvalov mesh @xcite and the shishkin mesh @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath4/@xmath0-version finite element method ( fem ) or for spectral methods , the _ spectral boundary layer mesh _",
    "@xcite is essentially the smallest mesh that permits the resolution of boundary layers ( see definition  [ sbl ] ahead for the 1d version and section  [ sec:2d - meshes ] for a realization in 2d ) .",
    "the use of the above mentioned meshes can lead to robust convergence , i.e. , convergence uniform in the singular perturbation parameter . for the reaction - diffusion equations ( [ eq:1d - problem ] ) , ( [ eq:2d - problem ] ) under consideration here ,",
    "the fem is naturally analyzed in the _ energy norm _",
    "( [ eq : energy - norm-1d ] ) , ( [ eq : energy - norm-2d ] ) , which is simply the norm induced by the inner - product defined by the bilinear form of the variational problem ; robust convergence of the @xmath5-fem on shishkin meshes can be found , for example , in @xcite and robust exponential convergence on _ spectral boundary layer meshes _ is shown in @xcite .",
    "the ( natural ) energy norm associated with this boundary value problem is rather weak in that the layer contributions are not `` seen '' by the energy norm ; that is , the energy norm of the layer contribution vanishes as the singular perturbation parameter @xmath1 tends to zero whereas the energy norm of the smooth part of the solution does not .",
    "this has sparked the recent work @xcite to study the convergence of the @xmath5-fem in norms stronger than the energy norm .",
    "the analysis of @xcite is performed in an @xmath1-weighted @xmath2-norm which is _ balanced _ in the sense that both the smooth part and the layer part are ( generically ) bounded away from zero uniformly in @xmath1 ; both energy norm ( see ( [ eq : energy - norm-1d ] ) , ( [ eq : energy - norm-2d ] ) for the 1d and 2d case , respectively ) and balanced norm ( see ( [ eq : balanced - norm-1d ] ) , ( [ eq : balanced - norm-2d ] ) ) are @xmath1-weighted @xmath2-norms but they differ in the @xmath1-scaling .",
    "robust convergence in this balanced norm is shown in @xcite if shishkin meshes are employed .",
    "we show in the present work that this analysis can be extended to the @xmath0-version fem on _ spectral boundary layer meshes _ to give robust exponential convergence of the @xmath0-version fem in this balanced norm .",
    "an additional outcome of our convergence analysis in the balanced norm is the robust exponential convergence in the maximum norm .",
    "it is worth mentioning that robust exponential convergence of the @xmath0-fem on _ spectral boundary layer meshes _ in the balanced norm was shown earlier in special cases .",
    "for example , for the case of equations with constant coefficients and polynomial right - hand sides , @xcite observes that the smooth part of the asymptotic expansion is again polynomial and therefore in the finite element space .",
    "it follows that a factor @xmath6 is gained in the convergence estimate and leads to robust exponential convergence in the balanced norm .",
    "a more detailed discussion of similar effects can be found in the concluding remarks of @xcite and in the section with numerical results in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly discuss the ideas underlying our analysis .",
    "asymptotic expansions may be viewed as a tool to decompose the solution into components associated with different length scales .",
    "roughly speaking , our analysis in balanced norms mimicks this technique on the discrete level in that the galerkin approximation is likewise decomposed into components associated with different length scales . in total ,",
    "our analysis involves the following ideas :    1 .",
    "an analysis of the difference between the fem approximation and a galerkin approximation to a _",
    "reduced problem_. 2 .   a stable decomposition of the fem space on the layer - adapted mesh into fine and coarse components .",
    "this decomposition relies essentially on strengthened cauchy - schwarz inequalities .    throughout the paper we will utilize the usual sobolev space notation @xmath7 to denote the space of functions on @xmath8 with weak derivatives up to order @xmath9 in @xmath10 , equipped with the norm @xmath11 and seminorm @xmath12 .",
    "we will also use the space @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the boundary of @xmath8 .",
    "the norm of the space @xmath15 of essentially bounded functions is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the letters @xmath17 , @xmath18 will be used to denote generic positive constants , independent of any discretization or singular perturbation parameters and possibly having different values in each occurrence .",
    "finally , the notation @xmath19 means the existence of a positive constant @xmath17 , which is independent of the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 under consideration and of the singular perturbation parameter @xmath1 , such that @xmath22 .",
    "we start with the one - dimensional case as many of the ideas can be seen in this setting already .",
    "we consider the following model problem : find @xmath23 such that    [ eq:1d - problem ] @xmath24    the parameter @xmath25 is given , as are the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are assumed to be analytic on @xmath28 $ ] .",
