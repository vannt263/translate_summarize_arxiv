    "let me first start with what this talk will not be :    * an introduction to supersymmetry .",
    "first of all you are all experts in the field , and second we just attended an excellent introductory presentation@xcite ; * a discussion of the cosmological aspects , mostly due to my inability ; * a comprehensive review because of the limited amount of time available .",
    "this discussion will rather focus on :    * the lep legacy , with minimal experimental details , because the lep results often remain the most constraining at this point ; * recent results from the run ii of the tevatron , which is curently the most powerful collider in operation . at the tevatron ,",
    "proton - antiproton collisions take place at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev , and the instantaneous luminosity recently reached the @xmath0@xmath1s@xmath2 level .",
    "the frameworks in which these results will be presented are :    * most of the time `` standard susy '' .",
    "this means the mssm , often with some generic unification constraints ( essentially for slepton or gaugino susy - breaking masses ) at the scale of grand unification ( gut ) , and with the assumption that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the lightest neutralino @xmath3 .",
    "occasionnally , the model considered will be even more constrained in the form of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) ; * in a few instances gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , which offers clean and simple signatures , in its minimal version ; * with r - parity conservation .",
    "again , this is mostly due to lack of time in view of the large number of equally acceptable scenarios , and also partly because of a personal prejudice having to do with the absence of dark matter in r - parity violating models .",
    "( here i have to seek forgiveness from my hera colleagues . )    at lep , all supersymmetric particles , except for the gluinos , are produced in a rather democratic fashion via electroweak interactions , up to mass effects . since",
    "pair production of the lsp is not directly detectable , the search is naturally directed towards the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particles ( nlsp s ) .",
    "the results can often be presented in a model independent , or at least moderately dependent , way .",
    "results from various channels can furthermore be combined within some specific theoretical framework to derive additional constraints , of which the most celebrated one is the lsp - mass lower limit .    at the tevatron ,",
    "colored particles ( i.e. , squarks and gluinos ) are expected to be produced with large cross sections via strong interactions .",
    "the resulting final states consisting mostly of jets and missing transverse energy however suffer from large backgrounds from standard multijet production .",
    "the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos has a much lower cross section , but clean final states such as trileptons and missing transverse energy are considerably easier to discriminate from standard model backgrounds .",
    "finally , in contrast to the situation at lep , a model independent presentation of the results is usually unavailable because it is highly unpractical to provide one which would be both transparent and meaningful .",
    "all limits ( unfortunately ... ) quoted in the following are given at 95% confidence level .",
    "because this is probably the simplest channel , both theoretically and experimentally , among those which have been analysed at lep , let us begin with the search for smuon pair production , which proceeds only through @xmath4 exchange in the @xmath5-channel .",
    "it is assumed that it is the supersymmetric partner @xmath6 of the right - handed muon which is the lighter of the two smuons , an assumption which is valid in models involving the unification of susy - breaking masses and which is conservative in terms of production cross section .",
    "the only parameter which is needed to calculate this cross section is the smuon mass . if the smuon is furthermore assumed to be the nlsp , the only decay channel available is @xmath7 , and the only additional parameter involved is the lsp mass @xmath8 .",
    "the final state consists in a pair of acoplanar muons , and the main background , from @xmath9 , is well under control .",
    "the search result obtained by the four lep experiments combined is shown in fig .  [",
    "smuonstop](left )  @xcite ; the gap along the diagonal is due to the softness of the muons when the @xmath10 ",
    "@xmath3 mass difference is very small . with the additional condition of gaugino mass unification",
    ", the assumption that the smuon is the nlsp can be relaxed , and the effect of cascade decays such as @xmath11 with @xmath12 can be incorporated .",
    "these cascade decays occur only at small values of @xmath8 , for which the smuon mass limit of almost 100  gev is slightly degraded .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the question can be raised of the relevance of the tevatron searches for squarks and gluinos .",
    "indeed , if gaugino mass unification is assumed , as it is the case in msugra , the lep limits on charginos translate into gluino mass limits well beyond those within the tevatron reach .",
    "similarly , if slepton and squark mass unification is assumed , the lep limits on selectrons are more restrictive than those on squark masses from the tevatron .",
    "the cdf and dcollaborations should therefore be encouraged to present their results within frameworks other than msugra .",
    "for instance , in susy - gut models where susy breaking is induced by an f - term which is a * 75 * of su(5 ) , rather than by a singlet , the @xmath13 ratio is of order unity , in which case lep results do not constrain gluino masses above 105  gev or so .",
    "string inspired models can also lead to similar gaugino mass hierarchies .",
    "before concluding , i want to quote a result which is a bit off the main track , but still relevant for supersymmetry .",
    "the cdf and d  collaborations have searched for the rare decay @xmath14 which is expected to be at the 3.5  10@xmath15 level in the standard model , but may be enhanced by a factor of @xmath16 , i.e. , by as much as three orders of magnitude , in supersymmetry . at the time this talk was given , the cdf collaboration had quoted a limit of 7.5  10@xmath17  @xcite , improving substantially over the previous best limit and probing relevant new territory , while the d  collaboration had not yet `` opened the box . ''",
    "has been set  @xcite ]    as of today , the main constraints on supersymmetry obtained at accelerators remain those established by lep . if fine tuned parameter configurations are discarded , limits of the order of 100  gev are set on slepton and chargino masses , and the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle has to exceed 47  gev in the mssm with slepton , squark and gaugino mass unification .",
    "the tevatron is however already providing relevant results . in the framework of gauge",
    "mediated supersymmetry , a lower limit of 108 gev has been set on the mass of a neutralino nlsp .",
    "trilepton searches should lead to new constraints on minimal supergravity in the near future .",
    "squark and gluino searches are well underway , although an adequate interpretation of the results is still lacking . with the continuously improving performance of the tevatron",
    ", the coming years can be expected to provide an exciting harvest of new results .",
