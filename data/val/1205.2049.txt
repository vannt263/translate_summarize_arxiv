    ", a planet may form , and if massive enough , open a gap in the disk @xcite , observed as a deficit in ir fluxes .",
    "a disk gap may also form when the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation of disk material by high radiation from the central star exceeds the mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "after the gap is formed the inner disk is drained onto the star by viscous evolution and/or is removed from the system through continued photoevaporation , creating an inner disk hole .",
    "circumstellar gas evolution has proved harder to probe than the dust , due to the difficulty of detecting spectroscopic gas signatures .",

    "fuv observations of 2 @xcite . in a study of 43 young stars ,",
    "i09 used low resolution fuv spectra from the advanced camera for surveys solar blind channel ( acs / sbc ) pr130l prism to study gas in disks surrounding accreting and non - accreting sources between 1 myr and 1 gyr .",
    "i09 located a continuum feature in the low resolution spectra near 1600  produced when 2 is excited by high energy electrons @xcite and found it present in accreting sources but absent in non - accreting sources . since the x - ray emission necessary for producing the high energy electrons is strong during pre - main sequence evolution @xcite , the lack of 2 emission in the non - accretors indicates that gas is cleared from the inner disk by the time accretion ends . however , i09 only observed non - accreting sources at ages @xmath210 myr and observations of young wtts were necessary to confirm that the gas is completely drained , even when accretion stops early on .",
    "we present fuv observations of 13 myr wtts in the taurus and chamaeleon i star forming regions and look for evidence of circumstellar 2 . in section [ results ] we present results on the presence or lack of 2 and in section [ disc ] we discuss mechanisms which may be responsible for disk evolution in these sources , as well as the evolution of high energy radiation from the star .",
    "we obtained observations centered on 11 young stars using acs / sbc on _ hst _ in go program 12211 ( pi : calvet ) .",
    "two of the fields contained wide binaries where the spectrum of each component was extracted separately ; however , one of the single stars was not detected in the fuv , therefore the total sample consists of 12 sources .",
    "each acs observation consists of a brief image in the f165lp filter and a longer image obtained with the pr130l prism .",
    "offsets between the target location in the filter and prism image , including the wavelength solution , were obtained from @xcite .",
    "the target spectrum was then extracted from a 41-pixel ( 13 ) wide extraction window .",
    "background count rates were calculated from offset windows and subtracted from the extracted spectrum .",
    "the absolute wavelength solution was then determined by fitting the bright c iv @xmath31549  doublet .",

    "the spectra cover 12301800  with a 2-pixel resolution of @xmath4300 at 1230  and @xmath480 at 1600  .",
    "the fuv detections include 7 low mass t tauri stars in taurus and 5 in chamaeleon i ( figure [ acs ] and table 1 ) . wtts were chosen based on a lack of evidence for remaining inner disk dust as traced by @xmath5 for taurus sources ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) , or by a spitzer irs slope @xmath6 between 2 and 24@xmath7 m or 3.6 and 24@xmath7 m for sources in chamaeleon i ( luhman et al .",

    "very low accretion may not register on the h@xmath8 line profile in low resolution spectra @xcite ; therefore , small quantities of gas could remain in the inner disk .",

    "we use a spectral type of m1 and assume equal contribution to the unresolved luminosity from each @xcite . for v827 tau ,",
    "the lines are too broad , indicating a binary aligned along the dispersion direction . @xcite found that v827 tau is a close binary with mass ratio of @xmath40.6 and separation of @xmath490 mas ( 13.5 au ) . with the close separation",
    "we do not separate the two components .",
    "chxr 68 is a triple system with a and b components separated by 44 and the a component itself a binary with a separation of 01 and mass ratio of 0.6 @xcite .",
    "we extract a and b individually and identify the two components of the a binary with a separation of 60 mas , but again due to the close separation , the prism spectrum of chxr 68a is a combination of the two sources .",
    "j1 - 4827 was not detected in the fuv .",
    "we used a continuum feature at 1600  , which is formed primarily by the photodissociation of 2 , as a gauge of the strength of 2 emission @xcite .",
    "we first de - reddened the spectra using published @xmath10 or @xmath11 magnitudes @xcite and the @xcite extinction law .",
    "the fuv continuum has contributions from several sources in ctts , including the chromosphere and accretion shock , in addition to the continuum produced by 2 dissociation @xcite . to approximate the fuv continuum at the pr130l resolution",
    ", we used the median fuv spectrum of the wtts and debris disks ( dd ) in i09 .",
    "i09 showed that no 2 emission was present in the spectra of these sources and there is no ongoing accretion , leaving only the chromospheric contribution .",

    "the i09 wtts / dd spectrum , scaled to the target spectra between 1400 and 1500  , the flux between 1575 and 1625  was integrated and represents the flux of the 2 feature .",
    "figure [ h2 ] shows the luminosities of the 2 feature in our sample combined with results from i09 .",
    "we also include new observations of accretors in chamaeleon i @xcite .",
    "many of the 13 myr wtts have 2 feature luminosities within 3@xmath12 of the luminosities of the i09 older population which were shown to be cleared of gas in the inner disk .",
    "the 2 feature luminosities of the wtts sample are lower than all but two of the taurus accretors . for v827 tau",
    ", the luminosity is high ( @xmath13 ) because of contributions from wide c iv and he ii emission lines produced by the binary observed along the dispersion axis .",
    "the ctts hn tau b has an 2 luminosity comparable to our wtts sample ; it is a low mass companions with spectral type m4 and unknown accretion properties @xcite .",
    "given the large error on the low resolution spectra and the similarity in 2 feature luminosities with the i09 sample , these results are consistent with the 13 myr sample of wtts being cleared of inner disk gas .",
    "as shown in figure [ h2 ] , circumstellar gas is depleted in short timescales for some sources , while others retain a gas disk , even at 10 myr .",
    "the diskless sources at 13 myr are interesting because they have lost their disks in timescales much shorter than the typical disk lifetime , 510 myr @xcite . the reason no disks remain for these sources may be due to the initial conditions , e.g. the initial disk mass or angular momentum of the parent cloud @xcite , or may stem from the physical processes which are responsible for dispersing disk material .",
    "close binaries ( @xmath9 40 au ) may be incapable of retaining a disk ; however only three of our sources are close binaries , v826 tau , v827 tau and chxr 68a @xcite .",
    "other possible mechanisms for disk dispersal include viscous evolution and accretion of gas , planet formation and photoevaporation .",
    "in addition to gas , the dust is gone , based on photospheric ir fluxes observed in irs spectra indicating a lack of inner disk dust @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed five of the taurus sources in the sub - mm , tracing the outer disk , and constrained the disk mass to @xmath90.0004 @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "they also compared sub - mm and ir data for their sample and found that most sources lacked excesses in both , indicating that inner and outer disks are dispersed within 10@xmath16 years of each other .",
    "therefore , both the gas and dust in both the inner and outer disks of our sample were likely depleted quickly .",
    "while planets alter the disk structure by forming a gap at their orbital radius , it is unlikely that they will completely disperse both the inner and outer disks @xcite .",
    "blue - shifted forbidden line emission at velocities around 10 km s@xmath17 is interpreted as evidence that gas is undergoing photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "theories of photoevaporation differ regarding the type of high energy emission responsible for the mass loss and the rates at which the material is dispersed , yet all models eventually produce a gap in the disk .",
    "initial models of photoevaporation by euv emission predicted low mass loss rates of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that once the initial gap is formed , both the inner and outer disks disappear quickly , in @xmath19 myr , consistent with the observations of @xcite .",
    "after the gap is formed , the inner and outer disk are influenced by continued accretion and photoevaporation , respectively , at rates of @xmath20 . at these low rates ,",
    "the disk mass at the time of gap opening must be less than @xmath21 in order for the disk to be depleted in @xmath22 years .",
    "given the early age of the sources in our sample , there is little time for the disk to be depleted down to the low masses needed for euv photoevaporation to disperse the disk .",
    "a larger disk mass is possible if the mass loss rate is higher than that predicted by euv photoevaporation , and recent models of photoevaporation which include x - ray and fuv emission achieve mass loss rates up to @xmath23 @xcite . in @xcite , the mass loss rate scales with the x - ray luminosity ; for the x - ray luminosities of our wtts sample ( see @xmath244.2 ) , the predicted mass loss rate would be @xmath25 . therefore both the inner and outer disk would contain @xmath26 to be completely removed in @xmath27 years , close to the range of predicted disk masses .",
    "however , objects with very low accretion rates yet with full disks can not be undergoing photoevaporation at such high rates , whereas the low mass loss rates predicted by the euv photoevaporation models are more consistent with observations @xcite .    instead",
    ", wtts may form from cloud cores with low initial angular momentum , @xmath28 .",
    "assuming stars both with and without disks at 1 - 3 myr formed from cloud cores with the same mass , the cloud angular momentum determines the mass distribution in the disk .",
    "the radius at which the cloud material accretes onto the disk is given by @xmath29 , which depends on the core gas temperature ( @xmath30 ) , angular velocity ( @xmath31 ) , and mass of the central star ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath33 k and @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is in units of @xmath37 rad s@xmath17 @xcite . assuming uniform rotation , the specific angular momentum is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the initial radius of the cloud in units of 0.1 pc .",
    "if matter falls from a cloud with @xmath39=0.1 pc at @xmath40 1 au ( which would accrete onto the star in only 30,00040,000 years ) , then j / m=19.5 @xmath41 s@xmath17 .",
    "this is a rough approximation of the angular momentum , as the actual collapse of cloud cores is significantly more complicated than assumed here and physical properties of the cloud ( for example , the magnetic field strength ) may be important @xcite .",
    "up to 20% of cloud cores have low enough angular momenta to form a disk which would accrete quickly , according to the models of @xcite .",
    "the observed disk fractions in the youngest clusters are 9095% @xcite .",
    "given the distribution of angular momenta predicted by @xcite , it is possible that the 510% of diskless stars formed from slowly rotating clouds .",
    "accurate estimates of the high energy emission in young stars are important because one or a combination of these fields may drive photoevaporation . the active chromospheres in young stars produce a uv excess with respect to the photosphere @xcite ; however , the total excess is difficult to estimate due to the small number of uv observations of wtts . here",
    ", we analyze the fuv emission of 23 non - accreting young stars ( combining our sample with the wtts / dd sample in i09 ) to characterize the evolution of chromospheric emission .",
    "wtts have no emission contributions from accretion or 2 , so the fuv continuum and hot lines are intrinsic to the young star and provide a gauge of the chromospheric emission .",
    "we also include published x - ray observations to probe the evolution of coronal emission @xcite .",
    "rosat and xmm - newton x - ray count rates were converted to x - ray luminosities in the 0.2 - 10 kev range using the heasarc tool webpimms for comparison to the x - ray luminosities of the i09 wtts / dd sample . in figure",
    "[ xrayfuv ] , we show the evolution of high energy stellar radiation fields between 1 and 100 myr .",
    "large x - ray samples of wtts indicate that the emission saturates around 10 myr @xcite .",
    "the x - ray saturation level of our sample , log @xmath42 , is within the errors of that found previously , log @xmath43 .",
    "the evolution of fuv emission is not as well studied as the x - ray evolution .",
    "@xcite observed that high energy emission , including fuv , decreases for solar type stars @xmath2 100 myr .",
    "@xcite determined the chromospheric indicator @xmath44 in a sample with galex data and observed a decrease in chromospheric activity between @xmath45 and @xmath46 years .",
    "evidence suggests that the same physical mechanism is heating both the chromosphere and the corona ; @xcite and more recently @xcite found that the coronal x - ray luminosity was correlated with indicators of the chromospheric emission ( e.g. the ca ii h and k lines ) and @xcite showed that x - ray and fuv luminosities are correlated for @xmath47 myr non - accretors .",
    "given this evidence that the heating of the chromosphere and corona are linked and should therefore saturate on similar timescales , we estimate the fuv saturation for sources @xmath48 10 myr ( shown in figure [ xrayfuv ] . )",
    "total fuv luminosities were integrated between 1230 and 1800  ( table 1 ) .",
    "we find that the fuv luminosity saturates at a level of log @xmath49 .",
    "we also see evidence for the beginning of the expected decline in fuv emission for the oldest sources in our sample .",
    "we presented results from an fuv study of the gas ( or lack of gas ) in the disks around 1 - 3 myr wtts .",
    "our conclusions are summarized here .    * a new fuv sample of young ( 13 myr ) wtts in the taurus and chamaeleon",
