    "random matrices and free probability are areas of applied probability with increasing importance in the area of multiantenna wireless systems , see for example @xcite . one key problem in the stochastic analysis of these systems has been the study of their asymptotic performance with respect to the number of antennas . the first answer to",
    "this question is the groundbreaking work by telatar @xcite , who , describing the system as a random matrix with statistically independent entries , showed that the capacity of this system is infinite .",
    "since this independence condition might be restrictive , several further proposals have been made over the past decade . as a result",
    ", a few models have emerged to take into account some instances of correlation in the system @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "operator - valued free probability theory has proved to be a powerful tool to study block random matrices @xcite .",
    "this has made possible to analyze certain systems exhibiting some block - based dynamics @xcite . with recent developments in operator - valued free probability theory @xcite ,",
    "simple matricial iterative algorithms now allow us to find the asymptotic spectrum of sums and products of free operator - valued random variables .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is show the significance of these new tools by studying a particular application in wireless communications .",
    "in particular , we study an operator - valued kronecker correlation model based on an arbitrarily correlated finite dimensional multiantenna channel . from a block",
    "matrix dynamics and a parameter related to the angle diversity of the system , an operator - valued equivalent is derived and then a method to calculate the asymptotic isotropic mutual information is developed using tools from operator - valued free probability .",
    "the model allows using information related to the asymptotic antenna patterns of the system . to our best knowledge , this the first time that a model with these characteristics is analyzed .",
    "more precisely , a multiantenna system is an electronic communication setup in which both the transmitter and the receiver use several antennas .",
    "the input and the output of the system can be thought of as complex vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of transmitting antennas and @xmath3 is the number of receiving antennas .",
    "the system response is characterized by the linear model @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an @xmath6 complex random matrix that models the propagation coefficients from the transmitting to the receiving antennas and @xmath7 is a circularly symmetric gaussian random vector with independent identically distributed unital power entries .    in a correlated multiantenna system ,",
    "there is correlation between the propagation coefficients .",
    "namely , the random matrix @xmath5 is such that the random variables @xmath8 are not necessarily independent .",
    "it is customary to take the random variables composing @xmath5 with circularly symmetric gaussian random law telatar1999 . in this context",
    ", the joint distribution of the entries of @xmath5 depends only on the covariance function @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    for a fixed rate @xmath12",
    ", it is known that the capacity of a multiantenna system grows linearly with the number of antennas of the system as long as the matrix @xmath5 has independent entries @xcite .",
    "this shows the well - behaved scalability properties of multiantenna systems .",
    "however , correlation may have a negative effect on the performance of the system .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to estimate quantitatively the effect that correlation may have .    throughout this paper",
    "we will assume that the transmitter uses an isotropical scheme , i.e. , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the transmitter power .",
    "in this case , a canonical way to quantify the effect of correlation is by means of the asymptotic isotropic mutual information per antenna @xcite . specifically , suppose that @xmath15 and for each @xmath16 the @xmath17 random matrix @xmath18 describes the channel behavior when there are @xmath19 transmitting antennas and @xmath20 receiving antennas .",
    "moreover , suppose that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are increasing sequences and @xmath23 converges to a positive real number .",
    "then , the asymptotic isotropic mutual information per antenna @xmath24 is @xmath25 as long as the limit exists .",
    "a common phenomena in random matrix theory is that the sequence of arguments in the expected value above converges almost surely to a constant , and under mild conditions also in mean .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic isotropic mutual information per antenna is given , essentially , by the a.s .",
    "limit of the aforementioned sequence .",
    "therefore , in order to find @xmath24 , it is necessary to derive a model for the sequence of random matrices @xmath26 that approximates the channel behavior in the finite size regime and then compute the asymptotic quantity @xmath24 .",
    "in this paper we use an alternative method described in four steps :    1 .   assign an operator - valued matrix @xmath27 to the matrix @xmath5 ; 2 .   compute the operator - valued cauchy transform of @xmath28 ; 3 .   via the stieltjes inversion formula ,",
    "recover the distribution of @xmath28 , call it @xmath29 ; 4 .   compute @xmath24 as @xmath30    the operator - valued matrix @xmath27 can be thought of as the asymptotic operator - valued equivalent of the channel @xmath5 @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the common approach consists of giving a model for the finite size regime , computing the mutual information , and taking the limit . on the other hand",
    ", the alternative approach takes _ limits in the model _ , replacing matrices by operator - valued matrices , and then calculates the mutual information .",
    "of course , these approaches are intimately related .",
    "actually , in the traditional case , they provide the same results converges in distribution almost surely to the marchenko  pastur distribution @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that @xmath31 converges in distribution to a noncommutative random variable whose analytical distribution @xmath29 is the corresponding marchenko ",
    "pastur distribution , which gives the asymptotic mutual information ( 1 ) . ] , but we prefer the latter approach since it is conceptually easier to understand and carry out , providing a powerful tool for modelling .",
    "we will see that this way of thinking goes well with channels exhibiting a block - based behavior .",
    "in particular , the operator - valued matrix assigned in step 1 carries the block structure of the channel and some other features of the system . in the example analyzed here , these features include the effect of the asymptotic antenna patterns and the inclusion of the starting finite dimensional channel correlation . to illustrate the kind of tools that may be useful in the assigning process at step 1 , in the next section we retrieve a block - based kronecker model from an angular - based model and",
    "derive the operator - valued equivalent @xmath27 .    in section [ section : model ]",
    "we derive the proposed operator - valued kronecker correlation model . in section [ section : asymptoticcapacity ]",
    "we discuss the asymptotic isotropic mutual information of our model using tools from operator - valued free probability . in section [ section : diagonalcase ]",
    "we consider a particular example where the implementation is simple but at the same time flexible enough to be applied in several interesting cases , like some symmetric channels . in section",
    "[ section : numericalcomparison ] we compare , through the example of a finite dimensional system , the mutual information predicted by the usual kronecker correlation model against the results from the proposed operator - valued alternative . in appendix a we summarize the notation , the background , and the prerequisites from operator - valued free probability theory . in appendix b",
    "we prove theorem thm : extremalcases on two extreme behaviors of the model regime . in appendix c",
    "we compute some of the operator - valued cauchy transforms required in this paper .",
    "the proposed model to approximate the channel behavior in the finite size regime is derived as follows .",
    "suppose that for a fixed @xmath32 , each antenna of the original system is replaced by @xmath33 new antennas located around the position of the original one .",
    "thus , the new system has @xmath34 transmitting and @xmath35 receiving antennas .",
    "figure [ fig : antennas ] shows the original system for @xmath36 and @xmath37 together with the corresponding virtual one for @xmath38 .     system . on the right the virtual @xmath39 system corresponding to @xmath38.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    for any given @xmath32 , the channel matrix @xmath18 for this @xmath40 system will have the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 matrix whose entries are the coefficients between the new antennas that come from the original @xmath44 receiving and @xmath45 transmitting antennas .",
    "we now derive a model for @xmath46 that takes into account the statistics of the channel matrix @xmath5 and the block structure exhibited above .",
    "first , fix a block @xmath42 , and for notational simplicity denote it by @xmath47 .",
    "this matrix @xmath47 should reflect the behavior of a scalar channel between two antennas of the original system when these are replaced by @xmath33 antennas each .    in a regime of a very high density of antennas per unit of space ,",
    "any two pairs of antennas close enough are likely to experience very similar fading .",
    "since as @xmath48 the new antennas are closer to each other , then the propagation coefficients between them are prone to be correlated . as an extreme case , we suppose that all the propagation coefficients between the antennas involved in @xmath47 have the same norm , and without loss of generality we set this to be one .",
    "this means that these coefficients produce the same power losses and the differences between them come from the variation that they induce in the signal s phases . with this in mind",
    ", we will suppose that for @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a real random variable and @xmath53 is a physical parameter that reflects the statistical variation of the phases of the incoming signals . in some geometrical models ,",
    "this statistical variation of the phases has been used , along with the angle of arrival and the angle spread , to study the capacity of multiantenna channels @xcite .",
    "some of the physical factors that have the most impact on the correlation of an antenna array are related to either the physical parameters of the antennas or to local scatterers .",
    "since these factors are different for each end of the communication link then , borrowing the intuition from the usual kronecker model , it is natural to take the matrix @xmath54 as a separable or kronecker correlated matrix , that is , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the square roots of suitable correlation matrices and @xmath58 is a random matrix with independent entries having the standard gaussian distribution .",
    "it is important to point out that @xmath47 is not kronecker correlated .      from a modelling point of view",
    ", the case @xmath60 represents the situation in which the environment is rich enough to ensure a high diversity in the angles of the propagation coefficients . on the other hand ,",
    "the case @xmath61 represents a system in which the propagation coefficients in the given block are almost the same .",
    "intuitively , the first case is better in terms of @xmath62 , since we should be able to recover the multiantenna diversity via the angle diversity ; while in the second case we almost lose the diversity advantage of a multiantenna system over a single antenna system .    in these limiting cases",
    "the following holds .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the ordered eigenvalues of an hermitian matrix .",
    "[ thm : extremalcases ] assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are full rank . for @xmath33",

    "entries with uniform distribution on the unit circle .",
    "suppose that @xmath67 is a sequence of positive real numbers such that @xmath68 as @xmath69 .",
    "then , almost surely , @xmath70 as @xmath69 where @xmath29 is the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of @xmath71",
    ".    see appendix b.    observe that in the second part of the previous theorem both @xmath47 and @xmath72 depend on @xmath33 as they are @xmath43 matrices .",
    "this means that the entries of the matrix @xmath47 become uncorrelated as @xmath60 , and , by universality , the spectrum of @xmath47 must behave similar to the spectrum of a standard gaussian matrix of the same size .",
    "observe that in this limiting case , we arrive at the well known case of i.i.d . entries , i.e. , the canonical model of a multiantenna system telatar1999 .",
    "as was mentioned before , in this situation the environment has a high diversity in the angles of the propagation coefficients , and thus it is natural that the system behaves as in the i.i.d",
    ". case .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath73 , the bulk of @xmath74 is close to that of @xmath75 .",
    "this suggests approximating @xmath76 .",
    "note that this limiting case leads to the well known kronecker correlation model @xcite . in the spirit of a worst case analysis , we will use @xmath77 in what follows .    in the proof of theorem [ thm : extremalcases ] we only used the fact that @xmath78 has",
    "an asymptotic eigenvalue distribution with compact support and @xmath79 converges a.s . as @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , under these mild conditions , the same analysis yields to the approximation @xmath81 for any model @xmath72 .",
    "in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum and invoking ideas from random matrix theory and free probability , let @xmath82 be a noncommutative probability space where the algebra @xmath83 has unit @xmath84 ( see appendix a ) .",

    "convergence in distribution implies weak convergence of the corresponding analytic distributions @xcite , see also appendix a.    in the derivation of this model , we can observe that all the @xmath120 depend on the new antennas around the original @xmath121th receiving antenna , and thus it is reasonable to take all them equal to some random variable @xmath122 . proceeding with this reasoning at the transmitter side ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the operators associated to the correlation structure of the antennas at each side , and @xmath126 .",

    "this is by setting @xmath130 . in the regime @xmath61",
    ", the latter implies that the mutual information decreases proportionally to @xmath131 .",
    "since we can incorporate the constant @xmath62 into the correlation operator - valued matrices @xmath132 and @xmath133 , for notational simplicity we will set @xmath134 in our discussion , thus we will take @xmath135 .",

    "observe that each @xmath122 depends on the new antennas around the original @xmath136th receiving antenna .",
    "thus the distribution of @xmath122 will depend strongly on the specific geometric distribution of the new antennas .",
    "for example , if all the new antennas are located in exactly the same place as the original antenna , we would obtain that the distribution of @xmath122 must be zero . in the case",
    "where the antennas are collinear and equally spaced , we can use some class of toeplitz operators as shown in @xcite .",
    "a similar argument can be used for the transmission operators .    observe that in this way we have incorporated the finite dimensional statistics in our operator - valued equivalent . moreover",
    ", the correlation matrix @xmath127 does not need to be separable , i.e. , with a kronecker structure .",
    "this shows that the operator - valued kronecker model is slightly more flexible than the classical version : it allows an arbitrary correlation resulting from the channel , and it also allows different correlations for different regions of the transmitter and receiver antenna arrays , which in our notation is encoded in the matrices @xmath133 and @xmath132 .",
    "in this section we derive a method to calculate the asymptotic isotropic mutual information ( [ asymptoticcapacity ] ) of our model using the tools of operator - valued free probability . for simplicity of exposition , in what follows",

    "since all the odd moments of @xmath145 are 0 , the distribution of @xmath145 is symmetric .",
    "we can then obtain the @xmath148-valued cauchy transform ( [ ctoper ] ) of @xmath147 from the corresponding transform of @xmath145 using the formula nica2006 @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the identity matrix in @xmath148 . since @xmath152 the spectrum of @xmath145 is the same as the spectrum of @xmath153 the @xmath148-valued cauchy transform of @xmath154",

    "if the correlation matrices associated to the correlation operators @xmath158 are either constant or exhibit a distribution invariant under random rotations , as we supposed for @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the previous section , then these correlation operators will be free among themselves . in some applications ,",
