    "it has long been known that an inflationary phase in the very early universe sources a background of gravitational waves .",
    "the amplitude of this background is tightly constrained by cosmic microwave background [ cmb ] data @xcite placing nontrivial constraints on the inflationary parameter space @xcite .",
    "the temperature anisotropy of the cmb is measured with much higher accuracy than the polarization anisotropy ( although constraints on the latter are rapidly improving @xcite ) but ultimately polarization measurements will provide the strongest constraints on the primordial tensor background @xcite . the amplitude of this signal is strongly correlated with the physical scale of inflation , and there is no guarantee that inflation occurs at a high enough scale for this primordial signal to be observable , even in an ideal experiment . in the longer term",
    ", space - based interferometers might make direct detection of this background at wavelengths of thousands or even millions of kilometers , but these comoving scales still left the horizon a number of e - folds before inflation ended .",
    "recently , substantial attention has been paid to physical processes at the end of inflation which generate gravitational waves  either preheating @xcite , or hawking radiation from primordial black holes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the usual inflationary signal , these backgrounds are sharply peaked , and have frequencies corresponding to `` laboratory '' ( or , at their lowest , solar system ) scales , as opposed to the astrophysical scales associated with the cmb .",
    "their amplitude can be substantial , but the technical challenges associated with the detection of high frequency gravitational waves suggest that it may be some time before these backgrounds are directly constrained .",
    "conversely , these backgrounds are sensitive to physical processes occurring at the end of inflation , and the coupling between the inflaton field(s ) and the rest of the matter sector , and could provide a unique window into the primordial universe .",
    "parametric resonance and preheating following inflation has been studied in great detail : see , for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "preheating as a source of gravitational waves was first discussed by khlebnikov and tkachev @xcite , and the topic was revived by easther and lim @xcite in 2006 , who discussed the scaling relationships between the gravitational wave signal and the inflationary scale , confirmed in @xcite .",
    "at least three other groups have developed codes for computing signal @xcite , which is a nontrivial numerical problem , and there is excellent agreement between them @xcite , although the internal workings of the codes differ significantly . consider a toy model comprised of a _ classical _ inflaton @xmath0 coupled to a second field @xmath1 with lagrangian @xmath2 the equation of motion for @xmath1 is @xmath3 expanding @xmath1 in terms of its momentum ( fourier ) modes we obtain @xmath4 as inflation ends , @xmath0 oscillates about zero . if we ignore the expansion of the universe @xmath5 and @xmath0 oscillates with constant amplitude @xmath6 , although backreaction from @xmath1 particle creation extracts energy from the @xmath0 field , eventually terminating resonance .",
    "changing variables to @xmath7 turns ( [ eomkmode ] ) into a mathieu equation , @xmath8 where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "every solution to mathieu s equation has two parts , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is periodic and @xmath12 isthe _",
    "mathieu characteristic exponent_. if @xmath12 has an imaginary part the solution has an exponentially growing mode .",
    "figure [ fig : stabilitychart ] shows the values of @xmath13 as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we see that ( [ mathieuparameters ] ) requires @xmath16 , so we are interested in the parameter values that lie to the left of the diagonal line in figure  [ fig : stabilitychart ] .",
    ".[fig : stabilitychart],width=264 ]    the amplification of selected @xmath17 ( and , by backreaction , @xmath18 ) makes the universe increasingly inhomogeneous , yielding an inhomogeneous , time dependent energy density  which necessarily leads to the emission of gravitational radiation . ultimately , the only way to follow the full evolution is via numerical simulation , and then extracting the contribution to the tensor modes .    the stress - energy tensor associated with gravitational radiation is given by @xcite @xmath19 and is specific to the _ transverse - traceless _ part of the metric perturbation .",
    "the @xmath20 denotes a spatial average and since we are solve for the field values ( and @xmath21 ) numerically , we simply integrate over the full `` grid '' on which our numerical solutions are computed . the associated energy energy density is the @xmath22 component , @xmath23 we compute @xmath21 by extracting the source terms for the equations of motion obeyed by the @xmath24 from the full @xmath25 obtained from numerical solutions of the scalar field dynamics @xcite .",
    "we express the gravitational wave power in terms of its contribution to the fractional energy density in gravitational waves , @xmath26 , per logarithmic interval in wavenumber , @xmath27 which we then convert in present - day units via an appropriate matching condition @xcite .",
    "field at three times , with an arbitrary normalization .",
    "gravitational waves are induced by ( time varying ) spatial gradients , which peak in the middle frame.[fig : field],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   field at three times , with an arbitrary normalization .",
    "gravitational waves are induced by ( time varying ) spatial gradients , which peak in the middle frame.[fig : field],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   field at three times , with an arbitrary normalization .",
    "gravitational waves are induced by ( time varying ) spatial gradients , which peak in the middle frame.[fig : field],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]        the resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sharply peaked , and located at very high frequencies when compared to both suspected astrophysical sources , and current and future interferometric experiments .",
    "the gravitational wave background depends on the details of the resonance bands in the underlying cosmological model , and modes move in and out of resonance bands as the universe expands . for the example considered here ,",
    "the lowest lying resonance band is dominant .",
    "modes whose physical wavenumber @xmath28 never enter this region during preheating are not significantly amplified , resulting in the cutoff we see at high frequencies in figure  [ fig : power ] .    in this model ( and many resonant scenarios ) , the resonant modes are not vastly smaller than the post - inflationary hubble scale .",
    "if the universe promptly reheats to the gut scale the comoving post - inflationary hubble scale is mapped to centimeter scales in the present universe , and the spectrum peaks near ghz scales . if the inflationary scale is _ lowered",
    "_ , the signal appears at lower frequencies , because the growth of the universe between the present day and the preheating epoch is necessarily smaller @xcite  and if the energy scale is very low ( closer to the tev scale than the gut scale ) , a background of gravitational waves generated during preheating would provide an alternative target for experiments like bbo .",
    "the amplitude of this signal does not necessarily change with the inflationary energy scale . only the gradient terms of the scalar field which source the gravitational wave background , and in many preheating scenarios the gradient energy rises until its average value is similar to that of the kinetic and potential energies . at fixed density this amplitude of the source terms",
    "are thus maximized .",
    "conversely , the _ initial _ power generated will decrease with the inflationary scale , since the quadruple and higher moments will be smaller .",
    "however , the overall expansion of the universe between preheating and the present day is also reduced in these scenarios .",
    "the energy density in gravitational waves scales like radiation , so @xmath29  and the combination of these two factors cancels , leading to a maximal amplitude of @xmath30  a number also seen in bubble collision calculations @xcite .",
    "a second , and more recently explored , mechanism which may generate gravitational waves in the post - inflationary universe is hawking radiation from decaying primordial black holes [ pbh ] @xcite .",
    "this analysis focusses on very small black holes , which decay before the onset of nucleosynthesis , and whose initial abundance is otherwise very weakly constrained .",
    "it has long been recognized that gravitons would be emitted as these black holes decay , although the precise rate is significantly modified by grey body corrections @xcite .",
    "assume a pbh population whose mass is equal to the energy contained inside the hubble volume at the instant they collapse .",
    "recalling that @xmath31 , and defining @xmath32 , @xmath33 which is the mass contained inside a sphere of radius @xmath34 .",
    "including grey body corrections @xmath35 a schwarzschild black hole emits ( massless ) particles with momentum @xmath36 , reducing its total energy as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the _ effective _ number of ( bosonic ) degrees of freedom , after integrating over grey body corrections @xcite . here",
    "@xmath36 is the _ physical _ wavenumber and the black hole lifetime is @xmath39 an upper bound on @xmath40 comes from the inflationary energy scale , which is constrained by the non - detection of a primordial gravitational wave background in the cmb . since we are interested in black holes which decay prior to nucleosynthesis with time to spare for thermalization , we need @xmath41  s. with @xmath42  gev , @xmath43  s , and the initial temperature is @xmath44  tev .",
    "standard model states alone give @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 with ( from left to right ) @xmath47 , and @xmath48 gev . in all cases",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 . , width=288 ]",
    "the mass - fraction of pbh is denoted @xmath51 .",
    "initially @xmath52 .",
    "we assume @xmath53 and that the remaining matter consists of radiation . denoting the number density of pbh by @xmath54 , the energy density @xmath55 we get the following set of equations @xmath56^{1/2 } \\ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] along with equation  ( [ eqn : kt ] ) from which one obtains @xmath57 by an appropriate rescaling .",
    "we again express our results in terms of the present - day spectral energy density of gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : e ] shows the present - day power in gravitational radiation as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "the gravitational wave power is substantial , and found at very high frequencies , relative both to any preheating signal , and the electromagnetic radiation in the cmb . roughly speaking",
    ", the temperature of the universe scales as @xmath58 .",
    "a decaying black hole is much hotter than the surrounding universe , but the emitted gravitational waves are redshifted by the same factor as other radiation .",
    "consequently , these gravitational waves will necessarily have a higher frequency than the present - day cmb , which peaks around @xmath59  ghz .",
    "lowering @xmath40 increases the pbh lifetime , enhancing this discrepancy and pushing the gravitational wave signal to higher ( present day ) frequencies .",
    "the signal also depends on @xmath38 and @xmath60 , as explained in @xcite .",
    "these primordial black holes survive for many hubble times , and since their density scales like matter , even a small initial population can lead to a universe that undergoes a transient period of matter domination before the black holes decay , which then rethermalizes the universe .",
    "the additional phenomenology arising from any such matter dominated stage has not been fully explored , and remains a topic for future enquiry .",
    "i have reviewed two different mechanisms for generating gravitational waves at the end of inflation  via parametric resonance or preheating , and graviton emission from decaying primordial black holes .",
    "physically these mechanisms are very different  the first is driven by the higher moments of the matter distribution and thus operates in the purely classical limit .",
    "conversely , hawking radiation is intrinsically quantum mechanical , and would not take place if @xmath61 .",
    "however , both mechanisms depend critically on the detailed behavior of the universe makes the transition between inflationary and `` regular '' expansion .",
    "parametric resonance and preheating depends sensitively on the couplings between the inflaton and other particles , whereas primordial black holes only form in models with a sharp rise in the primordial perturbation spectrum as inflation comes to an end .    in most cases , the frequencies of these gravitational wave backgrounds far exceed those which modern experiments such as ligo or virgo , and space - based successors such as lisa , are designed to detect . consequently , if meaningful constraints are to be placed on the backgrounds , new detector technologies are likely to be required .",
    "the one exception to this statement is if preheating occurs after low scale ( ie tev ) inflation , in which case the gravitational wave signal could be visible in proposed space - based interferometric detectors .",
    "this is particularly relevant to bbo , which has been designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave signal generated during gut scale inflation .",
    "this signal is invisible in low scale models , and the preheating signal provides an alternative source for a stochastic background , widening the set of inflationary models a bbo style experiment would constrain .    finally , it is clear that these signals are all `` futuristic '' in that placing meaningful constraints on their amplitude would require second or third generation gravitational wave experiments , and at the time of writing no direct gravitational wave detections have been reported . however , from a philosophical standpoint they serve to underline the rich phenomenology that can be associated with inflationary models , and the importance of fully exploring their consequences and possible observable fingerprints .",
