    "exact results in quantum field theories are rare and for some time the gauge / gravity duality @xcite has been a main tool for obtaining such results in a growing variety of situations .",
    "more recently , it has been appreciated that exact non - perturbative computations can be performed in certain supersymmetric field theories defined on curved euclidean manifolds , using the technique of localization @xcite . on the one hand , this has motivated the systematic study of rigid supersymmetry in curved space @xcite , and on the other hand it has prompted the exploration of the gauge / gravity duality in situations when the boundary supersymmetric field theories are defined on non - trivial curved manifolds .",
    "this programme has been initiated in @xcite , where a simple ( euclidean ) supersymmetric solution of four - dimensional minimal gauged supergravity was proposed as the dual to three - dimensional supersymmetric chern - simons theories defined on a squashed three - sphere ( ellipsoid ) , for which the exact partition function had been computed previously in @xcite .",
    "generalizations have been discussed by some of the authors in @xcite .",
    "further examples of four - dimensional gravity solutions with curved boundary , where in the dual field theory the path integral can be computed exactly using localization , have been discussed in @xcite . in this case , the exactly calculable quantity on both sides of the duality is the so - called supersymmetric rnyi entropy @xcite , which is a simple modification of the partition function on the ellipsoid @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in five bulk dimensions",
    "a supersymmetric solution , where holographic computations have been compared with exact four - dimensional results in @xmath7 scfts , has been recently constructed in @xcite .",
    "this constitutes an exhaustive list of references .",

    "explicitly _ in @xcite . this has provided a unified understanding of all previous localization computations on deformed three - spheres @xcite , and has shown that the partition function on these manifolds depends only on a single parameter @xmath13 , related to a choice of almost contact structure .",
    "specifically , for a general toric metric on the three - sphere , the real numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 specify a choice of killing vector @xmath16 in the torus of isometries . for a broad class of chern - simons - quiver theories ,",

    "indeed , the on - shell action of the solutions of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reproduced this formula , for certain choices of metrics _ and _ background gauge fields .",
    "more precisely , these are all supersymmetric solutions of minimal four - dimensional gauged supergravity in euclidean signature , and comprise a negatively curved einstein anti - self - dual metric on the four - ball , with a specific choice of gauge field with anti - self - dual curvature , that we refer to as an instanton .",
    "the result of @xcite raises two questions : 1 ) given an arbitrary ( toric ) metric on the three - sphere , with a background gauge field satisfying the rigid killing spinor equations @xcite , can one construct a dual supegravity solution ?",
    "2 ) assuming such a supergravity solution exists , can one compute the corresponding holographic free energy and show that it matches ( [ prediction ] ) ?    the purpose of this paper is to address these two questions .",
    "working in the context of minimal gauged supergravity , and assuming an ansatz that the solutions are _ anti - self - dual _ and have the topology of the _ ball _ , we will be able to provide rather general answers to both these questions . in the concluding",
    "section we will discuss the possibility of extending our results beyond the class of solutions considered in this paper .    regarding the first question , we will show that given a ( non - singular ) anti - self - dual metric on the ball with @xmath20 isometry , and a choice of an arbitrary killing vector therein , we can construct a ( non - singular ) instanton configuration , such that together these give a smooth supersymmetric solution of minimal gauged supergravity . moreover , assuming this metric is asymptotically locally ( euclidean ) ads , we will show that on the conformal boundary the four - dimensional solution reduces to a three - dimensional geometry solving the rigid killing spinor equations of @xcite , in the form presented in @xcite .",
    "we will illustrate this construction through several examples , including previously known as well as new solutions .",
    "we will also discuss how all the examples that we will present can be understood as arising from an infinite - dimensional family of explicit `` @xmath21-pole '' metrics @xcite",
    ".    we will be able to answer the second question , regarding the computation of the holographic free energy , _ independently _ of the details of a specific solution .",
    "namely , assuming only that a smooth solution with given boundary conditions exists , we will show that the holographically renormalized on - shell action takes the form [ freetoric ] i & = &  , precisely matching the large @xmath2 field theory prediction from localization ( [ prediction ] ) !",
    "we emphasize that ( [ freetoric ] ) will be derived without reference to a specific solution , and that it receives non - zero contributions from the boundary ( as expected ) , as well as from the bulk , specifically from the `` centre '' of the ball .",
    "this latter contribution may be understood as arising from the fixed point of the torus action , and can be determined from a fixed point theorem , using the berline - vergne formula .",
    "we will also present formulas relating the renormalized on - shell action to topological invariants of the bulk and conformal invariants of the boundary , by using the atiyah - patodi - singer index theorem , which may be of independent interest .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : local ] we discuss the local geometry of euclidean supersymmetric solutions of minimal four - dimensional gauged supergravity . in section [ sec : global ] we turn to global and smooth asymptotically locally euclidean ads solutions , with the topology of the four - ball .",
    "section [ sec : free ] contains the derivation of the general formula ( [ freetoric ] ) for the holographic free energy . in section [ sec : explicit ] we present examples . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude by discussing possible extensions of this work . appendices [ spinconnec ] and [ sec : weyl ] contain details about the geometry , while in appendix [ sec : construct ] we present a unified view of all the examples , arising as particular cases of the @xmath21-pole metrics @xcite .",
    "the action for the bosonic sector of four - dimensional @xmath0 gauged supergravity @xcite is [ 4dsugra ] i^ & = & -(r + 6 - f^2 ) ^4x  , where @xmath22 denotes the ricci scalar of the four - dimensional metric @xmath23 , we have defined @xmath24 , and the cosmological constant has been normalized to @xmath25 .",

    "this is simply einstein - maxwell theory with a cosmological constant @xmath25 .",
    "notice that when @xmath28 is anti - self - dual the right hand side of the einstein equation in ( [ eom ] ) is zero , so that the metric @xmath23 is necessarily einstein .",
    "a solution is supersymmetric provided it admits a ( not identically zero ) dirac spinor @xmath29 satisfying the killing spinor equation [ kse ] ( _ - a_+ _ + f _ ^ _ ) & = & 0  .",
    "this takes the same form as in lorentzian signature , except that here the gamma matrices generate the clifford algebra @xmath30 in an orthonormal frame , so @xmath31 .",
    "notice that we may define the charge conjugate of the spinor @xmath29 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the charge conjugation matrix satisfying @xmath34 , @xmath35 and may be chosen to be antisymmetric @xmath36 @xcite . then provided the gauge field @xmath26 is real ( as it will be in the present paper ) @xmath37 satisfies ( [ kse ] ) with @xmath38 .",
    "in @xcite the authors studied the local geometry of euclidean supersymmetric solutions to the above theory for which @xmath28 is anti - self - dual , @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that the metric @xmath23 then has anti - self - dual weyl tensor , and adopting a standard abuse of terminology we shall refer to such solutions as `` self - dual . ''",
    "supersymmetry also equips this background geometry with a killing vector field @xmath16 .",
    "self - dual einstein metrics with a killing vector have a rich geometric structure that has been well - studied ( see for example @xcite ) , and are well - known to be related by a weyl rescaling to a ( local ) khler metric with zero ricci scalar .",
    "such metrics are described by a solution to a single pde , known as the toda equation , and this solution also specifies uniquely the background gauge field @xmath26 .",
    "in fact we will show that @xmath27 is @xmath40 the ricci - form of the conformally related khler metric , so that @xmath26 is the natural connection on @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the canonical bundle of the khler manifold .",
    "moreover , we will reverse the direction of implication in @xcite and show that any self - dual einstein metric with a choice of killing vector field admits ( locally ) a solution to the killing spinor equation ( [ kse ] ) .",
    "this may be constructed from the canonically defined spin@xmath43 spinor that exists on any khler manifold .      in this section",
    "we briefly review the local geometry determined in @xcite .",
    "the existence of a non - trivial solution to the killing spinor equation ( [ kse ] ) , together with the ansatz that @xmath28 is anti - self - dual and real , implies that the metric @xmath23 is einstein with anti - self - dual weyl tensor .",
    "there is then a canonically defined local coordinate system in which the metric takes the form [ sde ] s^2 _ & = &  , where v & = & 1 - y_y w  , [ v ] + & = & _ zvy z - _",
    "|zvy |z + 2_y(v^w)z|z  , [ dphi ] and @xmath44 satisfies the toda equation [ toda ] _",
    "z_|z w + ^2_y^w & = & 0  .",
    "notice that the function @xmath45 determines entirely the metric .",
    "the two - form @xmath46 is easily verified to be closed provided the toda equation ( [ toda ] ) is satisfied , implying the existence of a local one - form @xmath47 .",
    "the vector @xmath48 is a killing vector field , and arises canonically from supersymmetry as a bilinear @xmath49 , where @xmath29 is the killing spinor solving ( [ kse ] ) and @xmath50 .",
    "notice that the corresponding bilinear in the charge conjugate spinor @xmath37 is @xmath51 .",
    "thus as in the discussion after equation ( [ kse ] ) we may change variables to @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "in the tilded variables the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) and killing spinor equation ( [ kse ] ) are identical to the untilded equations , but now @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus the sign of the instanton is correlated with a choice of sign for the supersymmetric killing vector , with charge conjugation of the spinor changing the signs of both @xmath26 and @xmath16 .    as we shall see in the next section , the coordinate @xmath55 determines the conformal factor for the conformally related khler metric , and is also the hamiltonian function for the vector field @xmath48 with respect to the associated symplectic form .",
    "the graviphoton field is given ( in our conventions ) by [ a ] a & = & -v^-1_y w(+ ) + _ zwz - _ |zw|z  .",
    "we are of course free to make gauge transformations of @xmath26 , and we stress that ( [ a ] ) is in general valid only locally .    having summarized the results of @xcite , in the next two sections we study this local geometry further . in particular we show that any self - dual einstein metric with killing vector @xmath56 , which then takes the form ( [ sde ] ) , admits a killing spinor @xmath29 solving ( [ kse ] ) , where @xmath26 is given by ( [ a ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , every self - dual einstein four - metric with a killing vector is conformally related to a scalar - flat khler metric .",
    "this is given by [ kahler ] s^2 _ & & ^2  =  y^2 s^2 _ + & = & v^-1(+)^2 + v(y^2 + 4^wz|z )  .",
    "[ onkahler ] introducing an associated local orthonormal frame of one - forms [ kahlerframe ] ^0 & = & v^1/2y  , ^1  =  v^-1/2(+ )  , ^2 + ^3  =  2(v^w)^1/2z  , the khler form is",
    "[ omega ] & = & ^01 + ^23  , where we have denoted @xmath57 , _",
    "etc_. that ( [ omega ] ) is indeed closed follows immediately from the expression for @xmath46 in ( [ dphi ] ) .",
    "the khler form is self - dual with respect to the natural orientation on a khler manifold , namely @xmath58 above , and it is with respect to this orientation that the curvature @xmath28 and weyl tensor are anti - self - dual . we denote the corresponding orthonormal frame for the self - dual einstein metric ( [ sde ] ) as @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "next we introduce the hodge type @xmath61-form & & ( ^0+^1)(^2+^3 )  , and recall that the metric ( [ kahler ] ) is khler if and only if & = &  , where @xmath62 is then the ricci one - form , with ricci two - form @xmath63 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute @xmath64 for the metric ( [ kahler ] ) , and one finds that & = & 2 a  , where @xmath26 is given by ( [ a ] ) . thus the gauge field is the natural connection on @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the canonical line bundle for the khler metric .",
    "the curvature is correspondingly @xmath65 , where recall that @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the riemann tensor for the khler metric .",
    "a computation gives [ rprimitive ] -2&= & ^0123  , so that the khler metric is indeed scalar flat if the toda equation holds .",
    "since the ricci two - form has hodge type @xmath68 and the metric is scalar flat , it follows immediately that @xmath69 is anti - self - dual .",
    "this is because the anti - self - dual two - forms on a khler four - manifold are precisely the primitive @xmath68-forms ( _ i.e. _ having zero wedge product with @xmath70 , as in ( [ rprimitive ] ) ) , so @xmath71 .",
    "an explicit computation shows that with respect to the frame ( [ kahlerframe ] ) f & = & -_y(^01-^23 ) +  , which is then manifestly anti - self - dual .",
    "one can also derive the formula f  =  -(12 y k^+ y^2 k^j k^)^-  , where @xmath72 denotes the one - form dual to the killing vector @xmath16 ( in the self - dual einstein metric ) , and @xmath73 is the complex structure tensor for the khler metric ( [ kahler ] ) , and a further short computation leads to [ fddbar ] f & = & ( |y)^-  =   |y + ( y )  , where @xmath74 denotes the standard operator on a khler manifold , the superscript `` @xmath75 '' in ( [ fddbar ] ) denotes anti - self - dual part , and @xmath76 denotes the scalar laplacian for the khler metric .    let us note that the khler form is explicitly & = & y(+ ) + 2v^w z|z  .",
    "thus @xmath77 , which identifies the coordinate @xmath55 as the hamiltonian function for the killing vector @xmath48 .",
    "of course , @xmath78 is also the conformal factor relating the self - dual einstein metric to the khler metric in ( [ kahler ] ) .      in this section",
    "we show that a self - dual einstein metric with killing vector @xmath48 , which necessarily takes the form ( [ sde ] ) , admits a solution to the killing spinor equation ( [ kse ] ) with gauge field given by ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the key to this construction is to begin with the canonically defined spin@xmath43 spinor that exists on any khler manifold .",
    "the positive chirality spin bundle on a khler four - manifold takes the form @xmath79 , where @xmath42 denotes the canonical bundle .",
    "the spin bundle then exists globally only if the latter admits a square root , but the spin@xmath43 bundle @xmath80 always exists globally .",
    "in particular the first factor in @xmath80 is a trivial complex line bundle , whose sections may be identified with complex - valued functions , and there is always a section @xmath81 satisfying the spin@xmath43 killing spinor equation [ spinc ] ( _ - _ ) & = & 0  . here",
    "the hat denotes that we will apply this to the conformal khler metric ( [ kahler ] ) in the case at hand , and @xmath62 is the ricci one - form potential we encountered above .",
    "the connection term in ( [ spinc ] ) precisely corresponds to twisting the spin bundle @xmath82 by @xmath41 . using the result earlier that @xmath83 the spin@xmath43 equation ( [ spinc ] ) may be rewritten as [ spinca ] ( _ - a_)&= & 0  , which may already be compared with the killing spinor equation ( [ kse ] ) .",
    "more concretely , the solution to ( [ spinc ] ) , or equivalently ( [ spinca ] ) , is simply given by a constant spinor @xmath81 , so that @xmath84 .",
    "this equation makes sense globally as @xmath81 may be identified with a complex - valued function . to see this it is useful to take the following projection conditions _ 1 & = & _ 0  , _ 3  =  _ 2  , [ projections ] following _ e.g. _ reference @xcite .",
    "here @xmath85 , @xmath60 , denote the gamma matrices in the orthonormal frame ( [ kahlerframe ] ) .",
    "the covariant derivative of @xmath81 is then computed to be _ & = & ( _ + _ ^ _ )  =  _ + ( _ ^01+_^23 )  =  _ + a _  , where @xmath86 is the spin connection of the conformal khler metric , and we have used the explicit form of this in appendix [ spinconnec ] together with the formula ( [ a ] ) for @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that simply taking @xmath81 to be constant , @xmath87 , solves ( [ spinc ] ) .",
    "this is a general phenomenon on any khler manifold .    using the canonical spinor @xmath81",
    "we may construct a spinor @xmath29 that is a solution to the killing spinor equation .",
    "specifically , we find [ ks4d ] & = & ( 1+v^-1/2_0 )  . to verify this one first",
    "notes that the spin connections of the khler metric and the self - dual einstein metric are related by _ &",
    "= & _ + _ ^   ( _ y )  , where @xmath88 in a coordinate basis . the killing spinor equation then takes the form [ ksere ]   =   0  . to verify this",
    "is solved by ( [ ks4d ] ) one simply substitutes ( [ ks4d ] ) directly into the left - hand - side of . using the explicit expressions for the spin connection , the gauge field , the field strength , as well as the projection conditions on the canonical spinor @xmath81 and ( [ spinc ] )",
    ", one sees that ( [ ksere ] ) indeed holds .    from this analysis",
    "we can conclude that the self - dual einstein metric and the gauge field , which are solutions to einstein - maxwell theory in four dimensions , yield a dirac spinor @xmath29 that is solution to the killing spinor equation .",
    "this implies that these self - dual einstein backgrounds are always locally supersymmetric solutions of euclidean @xmath0 gauged supergravity .",
    "we turn to global issues in the next section .",
    "in this section and the next we will assume that we are given a complete ( non - singular ) self - dual einstein metric with a killing vector , which then necessarily takes the local form ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "moreover , we shall assume this metric is asymptotically locally euclidean ads , and in later subsections also that the four - manifold @xmath89 on which the metric is defined is topologically a ball .",
    "a two - parameter family of such self - dual solutions on the four - ball , generalizing all previously known solutions of this type , was constructed in @xcite . in section [ sec : explicit ] we shall review these solutions , and also introduce a number of further generalizations . in particular , the results of the current section allow us to deform the choice of killing vector ( which was essentially fixed in previous results ) , and we will also explain how to generalize to an _ infinite - dimensional _ family of solutions satisfying the above properties , starting with the local metrics in @xcite .    with the above assumptions in place , we begin in this section by showing that if the killing vector @xmath48 is nowhere zero in a neighbourhood of the conformal boundary three - manifold @xmath90 then it is a reeb vector field for an almost contact structure on @xmath90 .",
    "we then reproduce the same geometric structure on @xmath90 studied from a purely three - dimensional viewpoint in @xcite .",
    "in particular the asymptotic expansion of the killing spinor @xmath29 leads to the same killing spinor equation as @xcite .",
    "this is important , as it shows that the dual field theory is defined on a supersymmetric background of the form studied in @xcite , for which the exact partition function of a general @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory was computed in @xcite using localization .",
    "having studied the conformal boundary geometry , we then turn to the bulk in section [ sec : globalkahler ] .",
    "in particular we show that , with an appropriate restriction on the killing vector @xmath16 , the conformal khler structure of section [ sec : kahler ] is everywhere non - singular .",
    "this allows us to prove in turn that the instanton and killing spinor defined by the khler structure are everywhere non - singular .    in particular",
    "this means that each of the self - dual einstein metrics in section [ sec : explicit ] leads to a one - parameter family ( depending on the choice of killing vector @xmath16 ) of smooth supersymmetric solutions . in other words ,",
    "if the self - dual einstein metric depends on @xmath91 parameters , the complete solution will depend on @xmath92 parameters .",
    "we emphasize that in the previously known solutions the only example of this phenomenon is the solution of @xcite . there",
    "the einstein metric was simply ads@xmath93 , which does nt have any parameters .",
    "we are interested in self - dual einstein metrics of the form ( [ sde ] ) which are asymptotically locally euclidean ads ( hyperbolic ) , in order to apply to the gauge / gravity correspondence . from the assumptions described above",
    "there is a single asymptotic region where the metric approaches @xmath95 as @xmath96 , where @xmath90 is a smooth compact three - manifold .",
    "in fact the metrics ( [ sde ] ) naturally have such a conformal boundary at @xmath94 .",
    "more precisely , we impose boundary conditions such that @xmath97 is analytic around @xmath94 , so [ wanalytic ] w(y , z,|z ) & = & w_(0)(z,|z)+y w_(1)(z,|z)+y^2w_(2)(z,|z)+(y^3 )  .",
    "it follows that v(y , z,|z ) & = & 1 - y w_(1)(z,|z)-y^2 w_(2)(z,|z)+(y^3 )  , and that the metric ( [ sde ] ) is s^2 _ & = & + 1y^2  .",
    "setting @xmath98 this is to leading order s^2 _ & & + r^2  , as @xmath96 , so that the metric is indeed asymptotically locally euclidean ads around @xmath94 .",
    "here we have also expanded the one - form tangent to @xmath90 ( y , z,|z)_m_3 & = & _ ( 0)(z,|z ) + y _ ( 1)(z,|z ) + o(y^2)[phiexp ] .",
    "in fact by expanding ( [ dphi ] ) one can show that @xmath99 .",
    "of course , as usual one is free to redefine @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is any smooth , nowhere zero function on @xmath90 , resulting in a conformal transformation of the boundary metric @xmath102 .",
    "however , in the present context notice that @xmath98 is a _",
    "natural _ choice of radial coordinate .    with the analytic boundary condition ( [ wanalytic ] ) for @xmath45",
    "it follows automatically that @xmath48 is nowhere zero in a neighbourhood of the conformal boundary @xmath94 .",
    "as we shall see , this will reproduce the same structure on @xmath90 as @xcite , but we should stress that this is not the general situation . for example , one could take the standard hyperbolic metric for euclidean ads , conformally embedded as a unit ball in @xmath103 , and take @xmath16 to be the killing vector that rotates the first factor in @xmath104 .",
    "in fact this will be the _ natural _ choice of @xmath16 that arises in the two - monopole solution described in appendix [ 2pole ] .",
    "the ansatz ( [ wanalytic ] ) is thus certainly a restriction on the class of possible globally regular solutions , although all examples in section [ sec : explicit ] have choices of killing vector for which this expansion holds .",
    "returning to the case at hand , the conformal boundary is a compact three - manifold @xmath90 ( by assumption ) , and from the above discussion a natural choice of representative for the metric is [ 3metric ] s^2_m_3 & = & ( + _ 0)^2 + 4^w_(0)z|z  .",
    "notice that the form of the metric ( [ 3metric ] ) is precisely of the form studied in @xcite .",
    "in that reference an important role is played by the one - form [ eta ]   + _ 0  , which has exterior derivative [ phi0 ]  =  _ 0 & = & 2_y(v^w)_y=0z|z  =   w_(1)^w_(0)z|z  .",
    "the form @xmath105 is a global _ almost contact one - form _ on @xmath90 .",
    "the most straightforward way to derive this in the case at hand is to note the form of the boundary killing spinor equation in section [ sec : bkse ] and appeal to the results of @xcite .",
    "the killing vector @xmath48 is the _ reeb vector _ for the almost contact form @xmath105 , as follows from the equations k&= & 1  , k  =  0  .",
    "the orbits of @xmath16 thus foliate @xmath90 , and moreover this foliation is transversely holomorphic with local complex coordinate @xmath106 .",
    "when the orbits of @xmath16 all close it generates a @xmath107 symmetry of the boundary structure , and the orbit space @xmath108 is in general a compact orbifold surface , on which @xmath106 may be regarded as a local complex coordinate .",
    "these are generally called seifert fibred three - manifolds in the literature .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath16 has at least one non - closed orbit then since the isometry group of a compact manifold is compact , we deduce that @xmath90 admits at least a @xmath1 symmetry , and the structure defined by @xmath105 is a _ toric _ almost contact structure . in this case",
    "we may introduce standard @xmath109-period coordinates @xmath110 , @xmath111 on the torus @xmath1 and write [ ktoric ] k & = & _  =   b_1__1+b_2__2  .    from ( [ phi0 ] )",
    "we deduce that the taylor coefficient @xmath112 is a globally defined _ basic _ function on @xmath90  that is , it is invariant under @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the almost contact form @xmath105 is a _ contact form _",
    "precisely when the function @xmath112 is everywhere positive .",

    "correspondingly , since the boundary killing spinor @xmath120 is a spin@xmath43 spinor , the solution ( [ zeta0 ] ) to ( [ 3dkse ] ) is similarly in a singular gauge . in this section",
    "we correct this by writing @xmath145 as a global one - form on @xmath144 .",
    "the expression ( [ a0frame ] ) for the restriction of @xmath26 to the conformal boundary is of course only well - defined up to gauge transformations .",

    "the first term is @xmath146 , which is always a global one - form on @xmath90 , independently of the topology of @xmath90 .",
    "however , the last two terms are not globally defined in general .",
    "we may remedy this in the case where @xmath144 by making a gauge transformation , adding an appropriate multiple of @xmath147 : [ aglobal ] a_(0 ) & = & -w_(1)+  .",

    "we shall return to this formula in section [ sec : equivariant ]      recall that at the beginning of this section we assumed we were given a complete self - dual einstein metric with killing vector @xmath48 , of the local form ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "we would like to understand when the conformal khler structure , studied locally in section [ sec : kahler ] , is then globally non - singular . as we shall see , this is not automatically the case .",
    "focusing on the case of toric metrics on a four - ball ( all examples in section [ sec : explicit ] are of this type ) , with an appropriate restriction on @xmath16 we will see that the conformal khler structure is indeed everywhere regular .",
    "it follows in this case that the khler spin@xmath43 spinor and instanton @xmath156 are globally non - singular , and thus that the killing spinor @xmath29 given by ( [ ks4d ] ) is also globally defined and non - singular . before embarking on this section , we warn the reader that the discussion is a little involved , and this section is probably better read in conjuction with the explicit examples in section [ sec : explicit ] .",
    "in fact the euclidean ads@xmath93 metric in section [ ads4 ] displays almost all of the generic features we shall encounter .",
    "the self - dual einstein metrics of section [ sec : explicit ] are all toric , and we may thus parameterize a choice of toric killing vector @xmath16 as [ ktoricagain ] k & = & b_1__1+b_2__2  , where we have introduced standard @xmath109-period coordinates @xmath110 , @xmath111 on the torus @xmath1 . it will be important to fix carefully the orientations here . since the metrics are defined on a ball , diffeomorphic to @xmath157 with @xmath1 acting in the obvious way , we choose @xmath158 so that the orientations on @xmath159 induce the given orientation on @xmath103 ( with respect to which the metric has anti - self - dual weyl tensor ) .",
    "this fixes the relative sign of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "given that we have also assumed that @xmath16 has no fixed points near the conformal boundary , we must also have @xmath14 and @xmath15 non - zero .",
    "thus @xmath160 , and its sign will be important in what follows .",
    "since the self - dual einstein metric is assumed regular , the one - form @xmath72 and its exterior derivative @xmath161 are both globally defined and regular . the self - dual two - form [ twistor ] & & ( k^)^+  ( k^+ * k^ )  , is a _",

    "the complex structure tensor for the conformal khler structure is correspondingly [ jkahleromega ] j^ _   & = & -y^ _   , where indices are raised and lowered using the self - dual einstein metric .",
    "it is then an algebraic fact that @xmath162",

    "of course @xmath94 is the conformal boundary ( which is at infinity , and is not part of the self - dual einstein space ) .",
    "we are free to choose the sign when taking a square root of ( [ ydefinition ] ) , and without loss of generality we take @xmath164 in a neighbourhood of the conformal boundary at @xmath94 .",

    "it follows that @xmath55 is everywhere positive on @xmath89 .",
    "the killing vector @xmath16 is zero only at the `` nut '' , namely the fixed origin of @xmath157 . at this point",

    "it follows from the definitions ( [ twistor ] ) and ( [ ydefinition ] ) , together with a little linear algebra in such an orthonormal frame , that [ ynut ] y_&= &  .",

    "there are then various ways to see that the corresponding supersymmetric supergravity solution is _",

    "it follows that the killing spinor @xmath29 is divergent at @xmath174 , and the solution is singular .",
    "the solutions are thus singular on @xmath179 if and only if @xmath180 is non - empty .",
    "since @xmath181 , the analysis will be a little different for the cases @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "we thus assume the latter ( generic ) case for the time being . as in the last paragraph , let us suppose @xmath184 . due to the behaviour of @xmath139 and @xmath45 near @xmath174",

    "when this happens , our analysis will be based on the fact that , since the killing vector has finite norm in the interior of @xmath89 , one can straightforwardly show that @xmath55 diverges if and only if @xmath194 .",
    "it is then convenient to consider the function @xmath55 restricted to the relevant axis , _ i.e. _ @xmath195 or @xmath196 .",
    "we have @xmath197 .",
    "suppose that @xmath198 ( for either @xmath189 ) starts out decreasing along the axis as we move away from the nut .",
    "then in fact it must remain monotonic decreasing along the whole axis , until it reaches @xmath94 at conformal infinity where @xmath199 .",
    "the reason for this is simply that if @xmath198 has a turning point then necessarily points along the axis , given the form of the metric ( [ sde ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath200 , which we have already seen can happen only where @xmath55 diverges : but this contradicts the fact that @xmath198 is decreasing from a positive value at @xmath201 ( and is bounded below by 0 ) . on the other hand , suppose that @xmath198 starts out increasing at the nut .",
    "then since at conformal infinity @xmath202 , it follows that @xmath198 must have a turning point at some finite @xmath203 . at such a point @xmath55 will diverge , and from our above discussion the solution is singular .",
    "this shows that the key is to examine @xmath204 at the nut itself .",
    "recall that the coordinate @xmath55 is a hamiltonian function for the killing vector @xmath16 , _ i.e. _ @xmath205 . from , we also know that @xmath70 is related to the two - form @xmath206 by @xmath207 , yielding @xmath208 . at the nut we may again use the polar coordinates @xmath209 for the two copies of @xmath210 , where the metric is to leading order the metric on flat space . in the usual orthonormal frame for these polar coordinates , using the above formulae we then compute to leading order [ signs ] ( y)| _ & &    -  ( b_1+b_2 ) _ 1 + 0 + -  ( b_1+b_2 ) _",
    "2 + 0    .",
    "thus when @xmath211 we see that @xmath198 starts out decreasing at the nut , for _ both _",
    "@xmath189 , and from the previous paragraph it follows that the solution is then globally non - singular ! on the other hand , the case @xmath212 splits further into two subcases . for simplicity",
    "let us describe the case where @xmath213 ( with the case @xmath214 being similar ) .",
    "then when @xmath215 we have @xmath216 starts out increasing at the nut , which then leads to a singularity along the axis @xmath185 at some finite value of @xmath217 ; on the other hand , when @xmath218 we have that @xmath219 starts out increasing at the nut , which then leads to a singularity along the axis @xmath186 at some finite value of @xmath220 .",
    "notice these two subcases meet where @xmath182 , when we know that @xmath169 at the nut itself , @xmath190 .",
    "this leads to the simple picture that all solutions with @xmath211 are globally regular , while all solutions with @xmath212 are singular , _ except _",
    "when @xmath182 . in this latter case @xmath55",
    "is infinity at the nut .",
    "as one moves out along either axis @xmath55 is then necessarily monotonically decreasing to zero , by similar arguments to those above .",
    "thus the @xmath182 solution is in fact also non - singular , although qualitatively different from the solutions with @xmath211 .",
    "one can show that , regardless of the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the complex structure ( [ jkahleromega ] ) is always the standard complex structure on flat space at the nut , meaning that when @xmath211 the induced complex structure at the nut is @xmath221 , while when @xmath182 the nut becomes a point at infinity in the conformal khler metric , with the khler metric being asymptotically euclidean .",
    "in particular the instanton is zero at the nut in this case , and so is regular there .",
    "notice that , for the regular solutions , since @xmath16 is nowhere zero away from the nut we may deduce that also @xmath222 is nowhere zero ( as @xmath70 is a global symplectic form on @xmath223 ) . in particular",
    "@xmath55 is a global hamiltonian function for @xmath16 , and in particular it is a morse - bott function on @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that @xmath55 has no critical points on @xmath223 , and thus that @xmath224 is the _ maximum _ value of @xmath55 on @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the morse - bott theory tells us that constant @xmath55 surfaces on @xmath223 are all diffeomorphic to @xmath144 .",
    "we shall see all of the above behaviour very explicitly in section [ sec : explicit ] for the case when the self - dual einstein metric is simply euclidean ads@xmath93 .",
    "the more complicated einstein metrics in that section of course also display these features , although the corresponding formulae become more difficult to make completely explicit as the examples become more complicated .      in this section",
    "we shall obtain some further formulae , valid for any toric self - dual einstein metric on the four - ball .",
    "these will be useful for computing the holographic free energy in the next section .",
    "we first note that for @xmath144 with reeb vector ( [ ktoric ] ) the almost contact volume in ( [ contactvol ] ) may be computed using equivaraint localization to give [ contacttoric ] _  =   _ m_3&= & -  .",
    "this formula also appeared in @xcite , although in the present paper we have been more careful with sign conventions .",
    "one proves ( [ contacttoric ] ) by an analogous computation to the duistermaat - heckman formula in @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ when @xmath105 is a contact form .",

    "in fact there is another interpretation of the constant @xmath155 , in terms of the charge of the killing spinor under @xmath16 . to see this ,",
    "recall that the solution ( [ zeta0 ] ) to the three - dimensional killing spinor equation ( [ 3dkse ] ) is simply constant in our frame , but that was for the case where the gauge field @xmath145 is given by ( [ alocal ] ) , which as we saw in section [ sec : a0 ] is always in a singular gauge on @xmath144 .",

    "the results of this paper extend these results to a general choice of instanton on the same background , parametrized by @xmath13 , leading to a _ three - parameter _ family of regular supersymmetric solutions .",

    "we have generalized the metrics of the previous subsection by adding a parameter , and one might wonder whether one can find more general self - dual einstein metrics on the four - ball .",
    "in fact from the gauge - gravity point of view it is more natural to ask the question of which conformal structures on @xmath8 may be filled by a self - dual einstein metric . of course one expects this problem to be overdetermined , and some general results in this direction appear in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , as long as the conformal class of the boundary metric @xmath370 $ ] is sufficiently close to the round metric @xmath371 $ ] , then one can write @xmath370=[g_{s^3}^0]+[g_{s^3}^+]+[g_{s^3}^-]$ ] , where @xmath371+[g_{s^3}^\\pm]$ ] bound self - dual / anti - self - dual einstein metrics on the four - ball @xmath372 , respectively . equivalently , viewed as self - dual fillings these induce opposite orientations on @xmath8 .",

    "however , starting with a particular ( conformal ) three - metric and trying to construct a global filling explicitly is likely to be very difficult . in order to construct further explicit examples one might instead attempt to directly generalize the plebanski - demianski metrics of the previous subsection . a natural way to do this",

    "@xmath21-pole solution_. of course , one could also replace the sum in ( [ mpolemain ] ) by an integral , smearing the monopoles in some chosen charge distribution .",
    "thus the _ local _ construction of toric self - dual einstein metrics is very straightforward ",
    "the above gives an infinite - dimensional space .",
    "however , understanding when the above metrics extend to complete asymptotically locally hyperbolic metrics on a ball ( or indeed any other topology for @xmath89 ) is more involved . in appendix",
    "[ sec : construct ] we take some steps in this direction by showing that the general 2-pole solution is simply ( euclidean ) ads@xmath93 , while the general 3-pole solution is precisely the plebanski - demianski solutions of section [ sec : pd ] .",
    "this requires taking into account the symmetries of ( [ toricmetricmain ] ) ( in particular the @xmath380 symmetry of @xmath375 ) , and then making a number of rather non - trivial coordinate transformations .",
    "we also analyse in detail the global structure of euclidean ads@xmath93 in the @xmath381 coordinates , together with some global properties of the plebanski - demianski solutions in the @xmath381 coordinates .    some work has also been done on global properties of the metrics ( [ toricmetricmain ] ) in @xcite , although the focus in that paper is on constructing complete asymptotically locally euclidean scalar - flat khler metrics , which are conformal to ( [ toricmetricmain ] ) . however , these have non - trivial lens space boundaries @xmath382 , and correspondingly the second betti number @xmath383 of the filling @xmath89 is non - zero ( they contain `` bolt @xmath384s '' ) .",
    "the corresponding complete self - dual einstein metrics in theorem b of that paper then also do not have the topology of the ball .",
    "thus it remains an interesting open problem to understand when the general @xmath21-pole metrics extend to complete metrics on the ball .- pole metrics by deforming , for example , a given 3-pole solution .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the details of this deformation argument further . ]    finally , let us remark that in @xcite lebrun has constructed infinitely many self - dual einstein metrics on the four - ball using twistor methods .",
    "this is essentially a deformation argument , where one starts with ( the twistor space of ) euclidean ads@xmath93 , and perturbs the twistor space .",
    "however , as such this is rather more implicit than the toric metrics above , and in order to construct supersymmetric solutions one needs to ensure that the resulting self - dual einstein metric has at least one killing vector field .",
    "nevertheless , this might be an alternative method for analysing regularity of the above @xmath21-pole solutions , at least in a neighbourhood of euclidean ads@xmath93 in parameter space .",
    "the main result of this paper is the proof of the formula ( [ freetoric ] ) for the holographically renormalized on - shell action in minimal four - dimensional supergravity .",
    "this result is analogous to the general formula for the volume functional of a toric sasakian manifold in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the latter was also entirely determined by the reeb vector field of the corresponding sasakian manifold , and was later shown to agree with the large @xmath2 limit of the trial @xmath385 function in a dual four - dimensional field theory @xcite .",
    "dual , was conjectured in @xcite .",
    "] moreover , we have provided a general construction of regular supersymmetric solutions of this theory , based on self - dual einstein metrics on the four - ball equipped with a one - parameter family of instanton fields for the graviphoton .",
    "specifically , if the self - dual eintein metric admits @xmath91 parameters , our constuction produces an @xmath386-parameter family of solutions .",
    "we have shown that the renormalized on - shell action does _ not _ depend on the @xmath91 metric parameters , but only on this last `` instanton parameter '' .",
    "this matches beautifully the field theory results of @xcite .",
    "we have also shown how all the previous examples in the literature , as well as some new examples that we have presented , can be understood as arising from an infinite - dimensional family of local self - dual einstein metrics with torus symmetry @xcite . in section",
    "[ infinite ] we have suggested that using this family of local metrics , it should be possible to construct global asymptotically locally ( euclidean ) ads self - dual einstein metrics on the four - ball , thus obtaining an infinite family of completely explicit metrics .",
    "it will be interesting to analyse these @xmath21-pole solutions in more detail .    in this paper",
    "we have achieved a rather general understanding of the gauge / gravity duality for supersymmetric asymptotically locally euclidean ads@xmath93 solutions .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of possible extensions of our work .",
    "first , it is possible to extend the matching of the free energy ( [ freetoric ] ) for the class of self - dual backgrounds we have considered to other bps observables . in particular in @xcite",
    "the wilson loop around an orbit of the killing vector @xmath16 is shown to be bps in the field theory , and may also be computed via localization .",
    "the gravity dual is an m2-brane wrapping a calibrated copy of the m - theory circle in the internal space @xcite , and computing its renormalized action one finds an analogously simple formula to ( [ freetoric ] ) , namely [ wvev ] _",
    "nw&= & w_1  , where @xmath387 denotes the large @xmath2 limit of the wilson loop on the round sphere / ads@xmath93 , which scales as @xmath388 , and @xmath389 denotes the length of the orbit of @xmath16 ( for example , such orbits always close over the poles of the @xmath8 , where @xmath390 or @xmath391 , respectively ; notice that for these wilson loops ( [ wvev ] ) is again a function only of @xmath392 ) .",
    "details of this computation will appear in @xcite .",
    "one might further generalize our results by relaxing one or more of the assumptions we have made . for example , remaining in the context of minimal gauged supergravity , it would be very interesting to investigate the more general class of supersymmetric , but non-(anti-)self - dual solutions @xcite .",
    "several examples of such solutions were constructed in @xcite , and these all turn out to have a bulk topology different from the four - ball .",
    "this suggests that self - duality and the topology of supersymmetric asymptotically ads@xmath93 solutions are two related issues , and it would be desirable to clarify this . on the other hand , at present it is unclear to us what is the precise dual field theory implication of non - trivial two - cycles in the geometry , and therefore this direction is both challenging and interesting .",
    "perhaps related to this , one of our main results is that a smooth toric self - dual einstein metric on the four - ball with supersymmetric killing vector @xmath297 gives rise to a smooth supersymmetric solution only if @xmath211 or @xmath182 .",
    "specifically , for other choices of @xmath13 the conformal factor / killing spinor are singular in the interior of the bulk . nevertheless , the conformal boundary is smooth for all choices of @xmath393 , and the question arises as to how to fill those boundaries smoothly within gauged supergravity .",
    "a natural conjecture is that these are filled with the non - self - dual solutions mentioned above .",
    "another assumption that should be straightforward to relax is in taking the gauge field @xmath26 to be real . in general ,",
    "if @xmath26 is complex the existence of one ( euclidean ) killing spinor does not imply that the metric possesses any isometry @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that if one requires the existence of _ two _ spinors of opposite r - charge , then there will be canonically defined killing vectors , and therefore it should be possible to analyse the solutions with the techniques of this paper",
    ".    all the above extensions would be important conceptually , in order to address the issue of uniqueness of the filling of a given conformal boundary geometry .",
    "in fact , this could also motivate the study of this problem in a more general consistent truncation , or directly in eleven - dimensional supergravity .    of course , in any of these more general set - ups a central issue will be to prove a generalized version of the formula ( [ freetoric ] ) for the renormalized on - shell action . in this respect ,",
    "some of the methods that we employed to derive this may be more amenable to generalization than others .",
    "for example , the expression ( [ freeindexform ] ) , given in terms of boundary conformal invariants and bulk topological invariants , might extend easily to the class of non - self - dual metrics and/or non - ball topology .",
    "we also expect that some of the results of the present paper can be adapted to dimensions different from four .",
    "in particular , on the one hand it would be very nice to understand better the structure of the holographically renormalized on - shell action in five dimensions , and on the other hand , to enlarge the list of examples , extending the work of @xcite .",

    "this is to emphasize the fact that in our general set up the parameters @xmath543 , @xmath26 , @xmath33 are independent .",
    "recall that given the one - form @xmath72 , dual to @xmath16 , and the expression for @xmath55 in ( [ ydefinition ] ) , the instanton @xmath28 can be derived using the following formula f  =  -(12 y k^+ y^2 k^j k^)^-  , where the complex structure tensor is _",

    "@xmath595 is the inverse of the self - dual einstein metric , and the contraction with the complex structure is defined as @xmath596 .",
    "we then obtain the following general expression 1y^2 & = & 14 1(q^2-p^2)^2 \\{^2 + & & -4 b^2 p(q ) p(p ) ( q+p)^2 }  . inserting the polynomial @xmath542",
    ", we see that this is actually a polynomial of degree two , symmetric in @xmath174 and @xmath291 , namely & = & p^2 q^2 ( 2 a b - b^2 e)+2 p q ( a b e - a^2- b^2 l)+(p^2+q^2 ) ( a^2-b^2 l ) + & & + 2 b^2 m",

    "( b e-2 a )  .",
    "these are all homogeneous degree three polynomials in the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath33 , but only their ratio is important , so we could set one of them to unity .",
    "we can also express the instanton in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , using the relations a & = & b_1 - b_2  , + b & = & - b_1 + b_2  .",
    "the @xmath598 component is rather simple and reads f|_(e^13+e^24)&= & [ b1b2f ] + & & ( b_1+b_2 ) ( b_1 ( p_4-p_1)-b_2 ( p_3-p_2 ) ) ( b_1 ( p_4-p_2)-b_2 ( p_3-p_1 ) )  , whereas the @xmath599 component does not simplify and we will not write it here .",
    "notice that the second line in ( [ b1b2f ] ) vanishes precisely in the three cases corresponding to the solutions in @xcite , where this part of the instanton is absent .",
    "these correspond precisely to the special choice .    that @xmath173 factorizes , so that @xmath163 becomes homogeneous degree one in @xmath174 and @xmath291 , as in ( [ y(p , q ) ] ) .",
    "similarly , the symmetric polynomial @xmath600 also becomes the cube of a degree one polynomial , so that the two functions cancel , leaving the enormously simplified instanton f & = & - ( e^12-e^34 )  , in agreement ) . ] with ( 2.28 ) of @xcite .",
    "we also note that under the exchange of @xmath174 and @xmath291 the two terms transform as ( e^12-e^34 ) & & ( e^12-e^34 )  , + ( e^13+e^24 ) & & -(e^13+e^24 )  , respectively , while the functions entering in @xmath28 are all symmetric .",
    "therefore , the special instantons in @xcite are symmetric under this exchange , while the general instanton is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric , thus breaking this symmetry completely .    in conclusion , in this subsection",
    "we have explicitly shown how starting from a metric with two non - trivial parameters ( @xmath601 mod scaling symmetry ) we have obtained an instanton , and hence a full supersymmetric solution , depending on one further non - trivial parameter ( @xmath594 mod scaling symmetry ) . by contrast , in the construction of @xcite , the full solution depends on only two non - trivial parameters , already appearing in the plebanski - demianski metric , and the instanton does not introduce a new parameter due to the relation ( [ speciali ] ) .      here",
    "we will show how to recover the taub - nut - ads@xmath93 metric s^2   =   r^2 + ( r^2-s^2)(^2 + ^2 ^2 ) + ( + ) ^2  , [ tnabove ] with ( r )  =  ( r - s)^2 ( 1+(r - s)(r+3s ) )  , from a limit of the plebanski - deminaski metric ( [ pdappendix ] ) , thus demonstrating that the former is a one - parameter sub - family of the toric 3-pole metric , where the isometry enhances to @xmath334 . applying the same limit to the general instanton on the plebanski - demianski metric ( [ generalpdi ] ) we will also obtain an explicit expression for the general toric instanton on the taub - nut - ads@xmath93 metric .",
    "following @xcite we parameterise the four roots of @xmath542 in terms of two constants @xmath355 , @xmath290 as p_1 & = & - -  , p_2  =  - +  , + p_3 & = & -a  ,   p_4  =   + a  , with was denoted @xmath602 . ] 2 m  =  -1  .",
    "then we make the following change of coordinates p  =  12 - a  , q  =   , [ cocpq ] and  =   -(4 s^2 + ) -  ,  =  k +  , [ cocts ] with @xmath603 an arbitrary real number . substituting @xmath604 above into the plebanski - demianski metric and taking the limit @xmath605 , it is straightforward to verify that one obtains precisely the taub - nut - ads@xmath93 metric ( [ tnabove ] ) .    comparing the expression of the killing vector in section [ thegeneral ] , namely k  =   _  =  a _ + b _  , with that given in section [ tnads ] , namely k  =  ( b_1+b_2)_+(b_1-b_2 ) _  , we deduce that the parameters @xmath594 must be related to @xmath606 as a  =  - ( b_1+b_2)+ ( + 4s^2 ) ( b_2-b_1 )  , b   =   ( b_1+b_2)+k ( b_1-b_2 )  . inserting these into the expression for @xmath607 in along with ( [ cocpq ] ) and ( [ cocts ] ) , and then taking the limit @xmath605 , one finds",
    "precisely the @xmath608 given in .",
    "notice that the final result does not depend on @xmath603 .    finally , using this change of coordinate / parameters in the instanton ( [ generalpdi ] ) , we find the following explicit expression for general instanton on the taub - nut - ads@xmath93 metric f&= & ( b_1+b_2 ) ( 16 b_1 b_2 s^2-(b_1+b_2)^2)(r - s ) ( _ 3+r ) + & & + ( r _ 3 -_1 _ 2 ) + & & ( -(b_1+b_2)^2 ^2 + & & + ( 2 s ( r - s)+1 ) ( 4s^2 - 1 ) ( b_1+b_2)^3 ^ 3 + & & -2s(b_1-b_2)(b_1+b_2)^2 ^ 2 + & & ( r^2",
