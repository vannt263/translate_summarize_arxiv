    "the critical properties of nonequilibrium systems have attracted attention and have seen a great development in the last years @xcite . this may be credited to their resemblance with critical phenomena occurring in systems in thermodynamic equilibrium . in equilibrium as well as in nonequilibrium phase transitions",
    "there is a singular dependence of the steady - state properties upon the control parameters , marking a transition between distinct regimes .",
    "other common features include long - range correlations , well - defined order parameter and singularities characterized by critical exponents that are grouped in universality classes @xcite .    due to absence of a general theory for the nonequilibrium regime ,",
    "these properties are analyzed in particular models , trying to form a complete picture .",
    "in particular , a class of simple models used to perform this task is constituted by lattice models with absorbing states .",
    "the presence of an absorbing state is sufficient for breaking the detailed balance condition , making these models intrinsically irreversible . in the steady - state regime",
    ", these models display a phase transition from an absorbing state to an active state , as the control parameter is varied .",
    "a very robust universality class for these models is the directed percolation ( dp ) class .",
    "it describes the critical properties of any system with a phase transition between an absorbing and an active state characterized by a scalar order parameter , short - range interactions and no conservation laws @xcite .    usually , the tool utilized in the study of these problems is the numerical simulation , but analytic approaches are also used as an important tool in this task leading , in some cases , to very precise results . as in other fields of physics ,",
    "simulational and analytical approaches are complementary in the study of phase transitions in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "one of these analytical approaches is the series expansion @xcite that has provided the most precise estimates of the dp exponents in one - dimension @xcite .",
    "inspired by the equilibrium case , the series for nonequilibrium systems can be either supercritical or subcritical , in analogy with the high- and low - temperature expansions in equilibrium systems .",
    "a pioneer work that uses series expansions for lattice models with absorbing states was developed by dickman and jensen @xcite , in their study of the critical properties of the contact process ( cp ) .",
    "the contact process is an icon among the models that display a phase transition between an absorbing and active state .",
    "initially the cp was proposed as a model for spreading of an epidemic disease @xcite and has become the `` ising model '' for the dp universality class . using subcritical and supercritical series , dickman and",
    "jensen obtained the critical point and its associate exponents .",
    "their results indicate that the supercritical case works better than the subcritical series .",
    "recently , de oliveira @xcite proposed an alternative approach for generating the subcritical expansion obtaining critical values comparable to those of the supercritical series @xcite . the difference between the approaches is that in @xcite , the non - perturbated operator ( associated with the annihilation of particles ) should be diagonalized , whereas this procedure is not required for the supercritical series .    in this paper ,",
    "a comparative study between subcritical and supercritical series expansion is performed for the pair - creation contact process ( pccp ) @xcite .",
    "although this model does not show any surprise concerning the critical properties , since it belongs to the dp universality class as the ordinary cp , it is interesting for the comparative analysis .",
    "we will show that the original approach for the supercritical series @xcite does not work properly , presenting problems in its construction .",
    "even an alternative version of the model , that would overcome these problems , does not lead to precise results for the critical point . on the other hand",
    ", the subcritical series gives results , without any maneuver , that are comparable to those obtained by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model and the operator formalism . in section 3",
    "we show the derivation of the supercritical series , discussing its problems . in section 4 , we attempt to overcome the problem by introducing a modified pccp and deriving the supercritical series . in section 5",
    "we present the approach for the subcritical case and results coming from the pad analysis for both pure and modified pccp .",
    "finally , in section 6 the conclusions and final discussions of this work may be found .",
    "we consider an interacting particle system on a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath0 sites .",
    "the system evolves in the time according to a markovian process with local and irreversible rules .",
    "the configurations are described in terms of occupation variables , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 according to whether the site @xmath3 is empty or occupied by a particle , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of the probability @xmath4 of a given configuration @xmath5 at the time @xmath6 is given by the master equation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the transition rate @xmath9 for the pccp is given by @xmath10 if an empty site has two occupied neighbor sites , then this site becomes occupied with a transition rate equals to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of the pairs of the first neighbors occupied .",
    "if the site is occupied , then it is becomes empty with a rate @xmath13 , independently of its neighborhood .",
    "when the lattice is entirely empty , the system is trapped in an absorbing state . however , for small values of the rate @xmath13 , an active state can be achieved in the stationary state . in this way ,",
    "a continuous phase transition occurs in this model with the critical point localized , according to simulational results @xcite , in @xmath14 .    to develop this operator formalism",
    ", we represent the microscopic configurations of the lattice by the direct product of vectors latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath65+\\gamma[r_1+r_2])^{-1}$ ] , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( are the number of empty sites with one and two pairs of occupied neighbors , respectively and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the number of empty sites with one and two occupied neighbors , respectively .",
    "the expression @xmath38 corresponds to the configuration obtained by replacing a hole at site @xmath3 by a particle . differently from the pure pccp ,",
    "the modified pccp does not have divergences when one takes the limit @xmath68 .",
    "thus , for configurations @xmath55 , we have that @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an integer number and @xmath71 is a configuration originated from @xmath55 by a simple creation process . the particular case of the vacuum @xmath72 for which @xmath73 does not diverge in the stationary state limit .    in the supercritical expansion the operator @xmath49 acting over any configuration ( except the vacuum ) generating an infinite set of configurations ,",
    "so it is impossible to evaluate @xmath74 in a closed form .",
    "we can evaluate , however , the ultimate survival probability @xmath75 , which corresponds to the coefficient of the vacuum . we define the series coefficients as @xmath76 using a proper computational algorithm , we can calculate the coefficients up to order 23 , with values of @xmath77 shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the limiting factor for this calculation is actually the memory required .",
    "we attempt to obtain the critical properties of the pccp model by performing the numerical extrapolation @xmath78 , since this approach does not work in the case @xmath79 .",
    "to analyze the series , we use the d - log pad approximants approach .",
    "these approximants are defined as ratios of two polynomials @xmath80 in our case the function @xmath81 represents the series for @xmath82 , for a fixed value for the parameter @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we are able to obtain approximants satisfying the condition @xmath83 .",
    "one verifies that diagonal ( @xmath84 ) and near - diagonal approximants usually exhibit better convergence properties , so that we will restrict our calculations to the set of approximants such that @xmath85 , with @xmath86 .    in the neighborhood of the critical point",
    "the ultimate survival probability behaves as @xmath87 .",
    "the critical point @xmath88 is determined by the pole of the approximant @xmath89 and the exponent @xmath90 by the residue associated with this pole .    in figure [ fig3 ] the estimates for critical points",
    "@xmath88 are depicted for different values of the parameter @xmath77 . using a linear extrapolation of these data ,",
    "we obtain the estimation for the asymptotic limit @xmath63 as @xmath91 , in disagreement with the simulational result @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we remark that decreasing the parameter @xmath77 , the dispersion of the approximants increases and the precision of the result becomes smaller .",
    "the exponent @xmath90 , as shown in figure [ figbeta ] , is in accordance with the dp universality class value for any value of the parameter @xmath77 , as expected .",
    "however , the uncertainties on the location of the critical point put in doubt the accuracy of the supercritical series around @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , what happens is that the coefficients of the configurations @xmath55 in the steady - state behaves as @xmath93 diverging as @xmath78 .",
    "this behavior causes a ill - conditioned series for @xmath94 , becoming impossible a more accurate result for the critical point in this limit .",
    "to develop subcritical series expansion , we rewrite the evolution operator as @xmath95 where @xmath96 . since the operator @xmath28 is associated to annihilation process and , for small values of the parameter @xmath97 , this annihilation process is favored , this expansion describes indeed the subcritical regime . differently from the supercritical case , the series here are generated directly , without the necessity of taking the laplace transform .",
    "the operator @xmath28 , associated to annihilation particles process , is expressed as @xmath98 , with @xmath99 .",
    "each term @xmath100 has the following set of right and left eigenvectors @xmath101 with eigenvalue @xmath102 and @xmath103 with eigenvalue @xmath104 .    to find the steady state vector @xmath105 , that satisfies the steady condition @xmath106",
    ", we assume that @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the steady solution of the non - interacting term @xmath28 satisfying the stationary condition @xmath109 the vectors @xmath110 can be generated recursively from the initial state @xmath111 . following dickman @xcite",
    ", we get the recursion relation @xmath112 is the inverse of @xmath28 in the subspace of vectors with eigenvalues and is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are right and left eigenvectors of @xmath28 , respectively , with nonzero eigenvalue @xmath116 . since the creation of particles is catalytic , if we start from steady state of the noninteracting term , that corresponds to the vacuum state , we will obtain a trivial steady vector . to overcome this problem",
    ", it is necessary to introduce a modification on the rules of the model .",
    "the necessity of changing the initial state in systems with absorbing states in order to get nontrivial steady states have been considered previously by jensen and dickman @xcite and more recently by de oliveira @xcite .",
    "the modification we have performed @xcite consists in introducing a spontaneous creation of particles . for the case",
    "@xmath79 ( pure pccp ) the creation occurs in two adjacent sites , chosen to be @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this modification leads to the following expression to the operator @xmath28 @xmath119 where @xmath120 is supposed to be a small parameter and @xmath121 .",
    "the steady state @xmath111 of @xmath28 is not the vacuum state anymore .",
    "now , it is given by @xmath122 where all sites before and after the symbol `` . ''",
    "are empty .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first , only the last term in @xmath111 will give nonzero contributions to the expansion so that @xmath123 , @xmath124 , will be of the order @xmath125 .",
    "second , although the change in @xmath28 will cause a change in @xmath126 , only the terms of zero order in the expansion in @xmath120 , given by the right - hand side of equation ( [ r ] ) , will be necessary since the corrections in @xmath126 will contribute to terms of order larger than @xmath125 .",
    "for instance , the two first vectors , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , for the pure pccp are given by @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 where the translational invariance of the system is assumed .",
    "for @xmath132 , it suffices to consider the spontaneous creation in just one site .",
    "this modifications leads to the following expression @xmath133 instead of equation ( [ wo ] ) .    from the series expansion of the state vector @xmath134 , it is possible to determine several quantities . in this paper",
    ", we will be concerned only with the series expansion for the total number of particles @xmath135 , given by @xmath136 one can show that the coefficient of @xmath137 in the expansion for @xmath135 is simply the coefficient of @xmath138 in @xmath139 .",
    "this allows us to get a longer series for the number of particles .",
    "for both modified and pure pccp , we have obtained a series with 38 terms .",
    "the critical behavior of @xmath135 obeys the following relation @xcite @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the exponents related to the time correlation length and to the growth of the number of particles , respectively . through an analysis of the d - log pad approximants , like that performed for supercritical series expansion , we are able to calculate the critical point and its associated exponent . using the series for the number of particles @xmath135 the values obtained were @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "these values do not agree with the best estimates , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "another estimate is obtained by performing a non - homogeneous d - log pad approximant @xcite . using this approach we obtained the value @xmath146 , closer to the value obtained by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "more reliable estimates are obtained when we determine the pad approximants for the series @xmath147 @xmath148 @xcite , called biased pad approximants . considering a given pad approximant",
    "@xmath149 $ ] and a trial value of @xmath150 , we develop the series above obtaining @xmath151 .",
    "we can build curves for different pad approximants by repeating this procedure for several trials @xmath150 and we expect that they intercept at the critical point ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) .    from the figure [ padepccp ] we see a very narrow intersection of the pad approximants , revealing the utility of this approach .",
    "however , as pointed out by guttmann @xcite , it is difficult to estimate uncertainties in series calculations .",
    "thus , in order to give a more realistic estimate of the quantities measured here and their associated uncertainties , we have estimated them by taking into account the first and last crossings among various pad approximants .",
    "the estimate of @xmath88 for the pccp , @xmath154 , in excellent agreement with the corresponding value obtained from recent numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "finally , the exponent obtained is @xmath155 , in agreement with the best estimation of @xmath156 for the dp universality class @xcite .    to stress the difference between subcritical and supercritical approaches , we have also developed subcritical series expansion for the modified pccp model for some values of @xmath77 , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] . in the limit @xmath63 , the subcritical approach gives @xmath157 , which is in good agreement with the estimate @xmath154 for @xmath79 and @xmath14 obtained from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the extrapolation for @xmath63 in the supercritical case does not lead to the correct value , as can be seen in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "in this work , we have considered the pair - creation contact process by carrying out a comparative study between subcritical and supercritical expansions . differently from the contact process ,",
    "the supercritical expansion in its canonical formulation @xcite is intrinsically ill - conditioned for the pccp .",
    "in fact , divergences in coefficients of the supercritical series occur for any model with creation by cluster of particles . as an attempt to circumvent the divergences",
    ", we introduced and analyzed a modified version of the pccp . however",
    "this procedure does not lead to the correct result when one recovers the original model .",
    "it would be interesting to search an alternative procedure to develop supercritical series for such models .",
    "we have shown here that subcritical series expansion provides results comparable with recent numerical simulations @xcite .    a natural extension of this work is the use of subcritical series to study models with creation by clusters ( pairs and triplets ) and diffusion of particles @xcite .",
    "results from numerical simulations @xcite suggest that these models display a tricritical point .",
    "thus this approach , associated with an analysis by means of partial differential approximants in two - variables , could be used to determine the existence of a tricritical point .",
    "in fact , such an approach has already been shown to be useful for the location of a multicritical point in a generalized contact process @xcite .",
