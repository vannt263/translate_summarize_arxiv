    "in the assignment problem , agents express linear preferences over objects and an object is assigned to each agent keeping in view the agents preferences .",
    "the problem models one of the most fundamental setting in computer science and economics with numerous applications  @xcite .",
    "depending on the application setting , the objects could be car - park spaces , dormitory rooms , replacement kidneys , school seats , etc .",
    "the assignment problem is also referred to as _ house allocation _",
    "if the outcome of the assignment problem is _ deterministic _ then it can be inherently unfair .",
    "take the example of two agents having identical preferences over two objects .",
    "then any reasonable notion of fairness demands that both agents have equal right to each of the two objects .",
    "since randomization is one of the oldest tools to achieve fairness , we consider the _ random assignment problem _",
    "@xcite in which objects are allocated randomly to agents according to their preferences .",
    "the outcome is a random assignment which specifies the probability of each object being allocated to each of the agents .",
    "in contrast to some of the earlier work on random assignment , we focus on the random assignment problem in which there can be more objects than the number of agents  @xcite .",
    "when agents express ordinal preferences over objects but the outcomes are fractional or randomized allocations , then there is a need to use _ lottery extensions _ to extend preferences over objects to preferences over random allocations . in random settings ,",
    "the most established preference relation between random allocations is _ stochastic dominance ( @xmath0)_. @xmath0 requires that one random allocation is preferred to another one if and only if the former first - order stochastically dominates the latter .",
    "this relation is especially important because one random allocation stochastically dominates another one if and only if the former yields at least as much expected utility as the latter for any von - neumann - morgenstern ( vnm ) utility representation consistent with the ordinal preferences  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 relation can be used to define corresponding notions of envy - free , efficiency , and strategyproofness  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we check which levels of fairness , efficiency , and strategyproofness can be satisfied simultaneously .    for the random assignment problem without multi - unit demands , the most common and well - known way to assign objects is _ random priority ( @xmath3 ) _ in which a permutation of agents is chosen uniformly at random and agents successively take their most preferred available object  @xcite . although @xmath3 is strategyproof and results in a pareto optimal assignment , @xcite in a remarkable paper showed that @xmath3 does not satisfy the stronger efficiency notion of stochastic dominance ( @xmath0 ) efficiency and also a fairness concept called @xmath0-envy - freeness .",
    "is that the resultant fractional allocation is # p - complete to compute  @xcite . ]",
    "furthermore , they presented an elegant algorithm called _",
    "@xmath1 ( probabilistic serial ) _ that is not only @xmath0-efficient and @xmath0-envy - free but also satisfies weak @xmath0-strategyproofness . in @xmath1 , agents ` eat ' the most favoured available object at the same rate until all the objects are consumed .",
    "the fraction of object consumed by an agent is the probability of the agent getting that object .    since its inception  @xcite",
    ", @xmath1 has received considerable attention and has been extended in a number of ways  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it can be naturally extended to the more general case with multi - unit demands in which there are @xmath4 objects and @xmath5 objects are allocated to each of the agents  @xcite .",
    "the extension does not require any modification to the specification of @xmath1 : agents continue eating their most preferred available object until all the objects have been consumed .",
    "although this _ one - at - a - time _ extension ( which we will refer to as @xmath6 ) still satisfies @xmath0-efficiency and @xmath0-envy - freeness , it is not weak @xmath0-strategyproof  @xcite .",
    "incidentally there is another extension of @xmath1 called the _ multi - unit - eating probabilistic serial _ that was briefly described by @xcite but has received no attention in the literature . in multi - unit - eating @xmath1 , each agent tries to eat his @xmath7 most preferred objects that are still available at a uniform speed until all objects have been consumed .",
    "we show that multi - unit - eating @xmath1 satisfies desirable properties : it is weak @xmath0-strategyproof , @xmath0-envy - free , and unanimous .",
    "we point out that the problem of discrete assignment with multi - unit demands has attracted considerable attention  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on _ random _ assignments with multi - unit demands .",
    "multi - unit demand is a natural requirement in settings such as course allocation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will require that each agents gets equal number of objects  @xcite .",
    "this is a natural requirement in settings such as paper assignment to referees .",
    "apart from @xmath3 and @xmath1 , two other natural assignment rules are _ uniform _ and _ priority_. in the uniform rule , each agent gets @xmath8 of each object  @xcite . in the priority mechanism",
    ", there is a permutation of agents , and each agent in the permutation is assigned the @xmath7 most preferred available objects .",
    "the priority mechanism is also referred to as _ serial dictator _ in the literature  @xcite . whereas uniform does not take into account the preferences of agents and is highly inefficient , priority is highly unfair to the agents at the end of the permutation . in more recent work ,",
    "@xcite proposed two mechanisms for the random assignment problem that also handle limited complementarities .",
    "@xcite presented a generalization of rp for more general settings .",
    "[ [ contributions ] ] contributions + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we first prove that for multi - unit demands , there exists no anonymous , neutral , weak @xmath0-strategyproof and @xmath0-efficient random assignment rule .",
    "the statement is somewhat surprising considering that all the four axioms used in the statement are minimal requirements .",
    "incidentally , we have not used @xmath0 envy - freeness that is often used to obtain characterizations or impossibility statements in the literature  @xcite and is a very demanding requirement . the result",
    "is then extended to random assignment _ without _ multi - unit demands if requiring weak @xmath0 group - strategyproofness instead of weak @xmath0 strategyproofness .",
    "our second result carries over to the setting randomized voting in which agents express weak orders over alternatives and the outcome is a lottery over the alternatives .",
    "we then conduct an axiomatic analysis of the ps . .",
    "it is first highlighted that the definition of ps . in the literature",
    "is not entirely correct . a proper definition of ps .",
    "is formulated .",
    "we show that for multi - unit demands , in contrast to @xmath6 , ps .",
    "satisfies weak @xmath0-strategyproofness .",
    "we prove that ps .",
    "satisfies @xmath0 envy - freeness which is one of the strongest notions of fairness . on the other hand , ps .",
    "does not fare well in terms of efficiency .",
    "we prove that ps . does not even satisfy ex post efficiency although it does satisfy unanimity .",
    "therefore when we generalize @xmath1 for multi - unit demands , @xmath6 is the right extension if the focus is on efficiency . on the other hand ps .",
    "is the right extension , if the aim is to maintain weak @xmath0-strategyproofness .",
    "the arguments for weak @xmath0-strategyproofness and @xmath0 envy - freeness of @xmath9 ps . also simplify the proofs for @xmath1 for single - unit demands in @xcite .",
    "the study helps clarify the relative merits of different assignment rules for multi - unit demands .",
    "the relative merits of prominent random assignment rules are then summarized in table  [ table : summarymulti ] in the final section .",
