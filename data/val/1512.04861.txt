    "the presence of the magnetic fluctuations associated with the stripe density wave phase proves crucial for stabilizing the nematic phase . on the other hand , nematic order",
    "was also observed in fese , a material where spin - magnetic order is only generated via application of external pressure , while a structural transition along with a softening of the lattice occurs at ambient pressure in a fashion very similar to the 122 iron pictides.@xcite this led to the suggestion that this system might be driven by orbital fluctuations .",
    "alternatively , given the observed small fermi surfaces of fese @xcite almost degenerate imaginary charge density and spin density waves are expected.@xcite therfore , a mechanism based on fluctuating and possibly ordered striped imaginary charge density waves was proposed that is conceptually very similar to the striped spin - driven mechanism.@xcite    in ref .",
    "the phase diagram of striped density wave induced nematicity was investigated . at a finite temperature phase transition , it was found that pre - emtive nematic order emerges via split phase transitions for some regime of the parameter space of the model , while in other cases a joint first order transition occurs , all in good agreement with experiment .",
    "clearly , fluctuations were crucial to derive this rich phase diagram .",
    "on the other hand : the behavior near the nematic transition seems to display generic mean field behavior , including the currie - weiss behaviour of nematic susceptibility .",
    "@xcite in addition , it was noted already in 1970s , @xcite that fluctuations of an order parameter that couples linearly to an elastic deformation are suppressed .",
    "this is the case for the nematic order parameter which couples linearly to orthorombic distortion via the nemato - elastic coupling .",
    "this can lead to mean - field behaviour , instead of @xmath11 or @xmath12 ising like behavior that is expected in the absence of the coupling to strain.@xcite in the context of the iron based systems , this effect was already stressed by cano et al . , @xcite and in ref . , where quantum critical elasticity was investigated . given these observations and the fact that fluctuations were essential for the derivation of the aforementioned phase diagram",
    ", it seems worthwile exploring whether the strain coupling induced mean field behavior of the nematic degrees of freedom can change the conclusions of ref . .",
    "to address this problem we start from a model of a spin - driven nematic phase , similar to the ref . and include the coupling to elastic strain .",
    "we then determine an effective order parameter theory of the nematic order parameter in the presence of strain . integrating out strain results in the appearance of the non - analytic terms in the propagator for nematic fluctuations , that are directional dependent , similar to what was found in refs . , where spin models in the presence of dipolar interactions were examined .",
    "these non - analytic terms lead to mean field behavior of the nematic transition and are shown to give rise to a curie weiss susceptibility over a sizable temperature range . yet , the strain coupling does not affect the very existence of nematic order and of the split structural / magnetic transition temperatures .",
    "thus , elastic strain changes the universality class of the nematic phase transition ( not of the magnetic transition ! ) but does not destroy the nematic phase itself .",

    "thus , only for very large correlation length and @xmath107 , is it possible that we obtain a second order transition .",
    "we remind the reader , that an anisotropic three dimensional system is described in terms of an intermediate dimensionality @xmath37 , see ref . .    finally , we comment on the splitting between the nematic and the magnetic transitions .",

    "this gives @xmath111 which occurs at the finite ( but large ) value of the magnetic correlation length @xmath112 .",
    "in other words , the nematic transition pre - empts the magnetic transition and occurs at a slightly higher temperature @xmath113 .",
    "the temperature difference is dictated by the value of the nematic coupling constant @xmath29 and the size of the nemato - elastic coupling constant .",
    "let us first analyze the case @xmath114 without coupling to the lattice .",
    "we still need to determine whether , for a given set of coupling constants @xmath115 , the correlation length ever becomes large enough to yield a positive sign for @xmath87 . in order to determine the location of the tricritical point of the nematic degrees of freedom ( i.e. where @xmath87 changes its sign ) , we use the fact that at the nematic transition and for @xmath114 holds that @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 , which we solve to determine @xmath118 : @xmath119 we use this result to express @xmath120 in eq .",

    "it is important to remind , that it was shown in ref .",
    "that for the phase diagram a dimensionality below @xmath36 effectively describes a three - dimensional , yet anisotropic system . a slope bigger than unity already suggests a broad fluctuation regime , except for a region near the tricritical point .",

    "( [ sphi ] ) for finite @xmath147 .",
    "this problem is similar to the one of a magnetic system with additional dipolar interactions . in refs .",
    "the critical behaviour of uniaxial magnets with dipolar interactions in @xmath36 dimensions was investigated using renormalization group approach .",
    "it was found that in the presence of the dipolar interaction the upper critical dimension is lowered from @xmath148 ( for the model including only exchange interaction ) to @xmath12 ( for the model containing both the exchange interaction and the dipolar interaction ) .",
    "this is because the dipolar interactions generate non - analytic directional - dependent terms in the spin propagator , similar to the non - analyticities that occur in the propagator in the case of second order elastic phase transitions , where the order parameter is a component of the strain tensor and where an acoustic phonon emerges as a soft mode.@xcite due to the directional dependence of the propagator in elastic phase transition,@xcite the softening occurs only along certain directions , which leads to the mean field behaviour already in @xmath12 for systems where the softening occurs in @xmath149-dimensional subspace , and for @xmath12 and @xmath150 logarithmic corrections were found to occur .    as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sound vel ] ) and ( [ sphi ] ) , the coupling of the nematic fluctuations to orthorhombic distortion , generates similar direction - dependent non - analytic terms in the propagator for nematic fluctuations , and only certain directions in momentum space remain soft .",
    "in fact , for a tetragonal system , one finds that ( see the appendix [ appb ] for the detailed derivation ) the softening occurs in @xmath149-dimensional sub - manifold , in particular along the directions @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "if we rescale the field to eliminate the coefficient @xmath153 , the action eq .",

    "( [ eq : sound vel ] ) and @xmath156 are given in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "we analyze this action using one a loop renormalization group approach .",
    "we define @xmath157 .",
    "the flow equations for this @xmath13 theory are straightforward , and we obtain the usual result ( see for example ref .",

    "this is exactly what has been observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite we add that this conclusion is valid regardless of the detailed microscopic origin of nematicity .",

    "@xmath198 indicates the characteristic temperature where mean field behavior of nematic degrees of freedom sets in upon approaching the transition at @xmath2 .",
    "the mean - field regime coincides with the regime of strong elastic modulus renormalization ( see the main text for the explanation).,title=\"fig : \" ] [ currie ]",
    "in the spin - driven nematic scenario magnetic fluctuations associated with the striped magnetic order cause the formation of the nematic state  the state with no magnetic order , but broken @xmath199 symmetry .",
    "therefore , fluctuations are crucial for the existence of the nematic state .",
    "however , experimentally it has been measured that the nematic degrees of freedom behave mean - field like in a very broad temperature range  in particular , the currie - weiss dependence of the nematic susceptibility was observed . on the first sight , these two observations might seem to be in contradiction .",
    "the present paper reconciles these two statements and determines the temperature regime where a curie - weiss behavior of the nematic susceptibility is expected .",
    "in particular , we show that the coupling to the lattice suppresses the fluctuations of the nematic order parameter itself , which renders the nematic transition mean - field , but it does not affect the magnetic transition or the very existence of the nematic phase . starting from a microscopic model of a spin - driven nematic phase , which also explains the emergence of the nematic phase at a slightly higher temperature than the neel temperature ( separated magnetic and nematic transitions ) , we constructed the @xmath1 theory of the nematic degrees of freedom .",
    "first we ignored the coupling to the lattice and by analyzing the quartic coefficient , we showed that nematic fluctuations are characterized by a rather large gizburg regime .",
    "next , we added the coupling between nematic degrees of freedom to elastic strain to the @xmath1 theory and analyzed this using the renormalization group procedure .",
    "we have found that , due to the nemato - elastic coupling which introduces directional - dependent terms in the propagator for nematic fluctuations rendering only certain directions to become soft , the nematic transition becomes mean - field for @xmath0 .",
    "most importantly , the nemato - elastic coupling does not supress fluctuations that cause the nematic order in the first place ( i.e. magnetic fluctuations ) , it only supresses the fluctuations of the nematic order parameter itself .",
    "we have found that the nematic transition happens at large but finite magnetic correlation length , such that one obtains split magnetic and nematic transitions , with the nematic transition being mean - field like ( rather than in the ising universality class ) , while the magnetic transition is expected to behave in a non mean - field like fashion .",
    "finally , we found that the mean - field behaviour of the nematic degrees of freedom should occur in the entire regime where there is a significant softening of the elastic modulus .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the experiments , where currie - weiss behaviour of the nematic susceptibility was measured across a rather large temperature range @xcite ( up to 300 - 350@xmath200 for some iron - based superconductors ) , which coincides with the temperature range in which a significant reduction of the elastic modulus was observed .",

    "<S> spin - driven nematic order that has been proposed for iron - based superconductors is generated by pronounced fluctuations of a striped density wave state . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> it is a well known fact that nematic order parameter couples bilinearly to the strain , which supresses the fluctuations of the nematic order parameter itself and lowers the upper critical dimension , yielding mean - field behaviour of the nematic degrees of freedom for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the measured currie - weiss behaviour of the nematic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> here we reconcile this apparent contradiction between pronounced magnetic fluctuations and mean - field behaviour of the nematic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we show , by developing a @xmath1 theory for the nematic degrees of freedom , that the coupling to elastic strain does not suppress the fluctuations that cause the nematic order in the first place ( magnetic fluctuations ) , yet it does transform the ising - nematic transition into a mean - field transition . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we demonstrate that the mean field behavior occurs in the entire temperature regime where a softening of the shear modulus is observed . </S>"
