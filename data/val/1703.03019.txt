    "classical spin models have found wide application to a vast array of problems in many branches of physics and other sciences .",
    "this is due to the relative simplicity of such models and the fact that the different spin states can be given many interpretations besides that of magnetic spins , including different kinds of atoms or molecules (  lattice - gas models \" ) , opinions , biological species in an ecosystem , etc .",
    "a few examples of these diverse applications are magnetic materials @xcite , high - energy physics @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , electrochemistry @xcite , polymer science @xcite , network reliability problems @xcite , and economics @xcite .",
    "the archetypal member of this class of models is the @xmath0 ferromagnetic ising model of binary spin variables placed at the sites of a lattice or a more general network and interacting via a simple hamiltonian . since its introduction for a one - dimensional system almost a century ago @xcite , this model has been joined by many antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic generalizations to higher spatial dimensions , multiple local states and/or multidimensional order - parameter spaces , such as the @xmath1 or three - state blume - capel @xcite and blume - emery - griffiths models @xcite . although the order parameter for the @xmath0 square - lattice ising model in zero field has been obtained exactly @xcite , solution of this class of models under general conditions , including in nonzero field , is known to be np hard @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "much effort has been applied to developing accurate approximate and numerical solutions , including mean - field approximations @xcite , series expansions @xcite , numerical transfer - matrix calculations @xcite , and a variety of monte carlo ( mc ) methods @xcite .",
    "although many ingenious algorithms have been introduced , development of improved numerical methods to study equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of classical spin systems remains an active research area .",
    "in this paper we present a generalization of the wang - landau ( wl ) mc method for calculating densities of states ( dos ) @xcite to systems with multiple order parameters .",
    "development of the method was inspired by applications to a class of molecular crystals known as spin - crossover materials @xcite , some of which can have competing antiferromagnetic - like short - range and ferromagnetic - like long - range interactions .",
    "a discrete - spin model of such a system was recently studied for a few values of two field - like model parameters ( an effective external field and the strength of the long - range interaction ) by a computationally intensive metropolis importance - sampling mc method @xcite . in order to obtain results for a wide range of model parameters with a manageable computational effort",
    ", a simulation method is needed that can produce three - dimensional dos , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total system energy , @xmath4 can be interpreted as a total system magnetization , and @xmath5 as a staggered magnetization @xcite .",
    "the method can also in principle deal with higher - dimensional order - parameter spaces .",
    "the original time - consuming wl random - walk simulation in multiple - dimensional phase space is broken down into many stages . in each stage , many independent wl simulations perform one - dimensional walks , each with different constrained macroscopic parameters . for the lattice model",
    "we consider in this paper , exact combinatorial calculations can be applied to simplify the process , so that only one stage of simulation in @xmath3 is required .",
    "as the simulations are run independently , no special skills in parallel programming are required . from the one - dimensional random - walk wl simulations in @xmath3 ,",
    "performed separately over a grid in the order - parameter space at one single set of model parameters , the method can produce dos for any value of model parameters and temperatures , using a simple transformation of the total system energy .",
    "this contrasts with both importance - sampling and the original wl mc methods , in which separate simulations must be performed for each set of model parameters of interest . from the resulting multidimensional dos , properties such as phase diagrams , free - energy landscapes , and joint and marginal order - parameter distributions can be simply obtained .",
    "another advantage of this method is the ability to use symmetries in the order - parameter space to reduce the number of simulations needed .",
    "( for instance , in the case of the spin - crossover model , such symmetry considerations lead to an additional eight - fold reduction in the computational work . ) for concreteness , the details of the method will be demonstrated here in the context of the model spin - crossover material of ref .",

    "to demonstrate the details and performance of the proposed method , and for its comparison with other methods , we will use a pseudo - spin model of a spin - crossover material with short - range antiferromagnetic - like and long - range ferromagnetic - like interactions , which was previously introduced and studied by metropolis importance - sampling mc in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath8 the local variables are @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the corresponding global  magnetization . \"",
    "the explicit sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs on an @xmath11 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and @xmath12 makes the local interactions antiferromagnetic .",
    "the second term models long - range , mean - field like ferromagnetic interactions of strength @xmath13 . in the third term , @xmath14 is the applied field ( actually an effective field in the spin - crossover model @xcite ) , which breaks the symmetry between positive and negative @xmath4 . @xmath15 and @xmath14 are the model s two field - like parameters . throughout this paper , we will use the notation @xmath3 to represent the total energy obtained through this hamiltonian , including the contributions from the terms proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 will be given in units of @xmath16 , and temperatures in units of @xmath17 with @xmath18 being boltzmann s constant .    while this hamiltonian includes only the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath4",
    ", we note that both linear and nonlinear terms ( in this case @xmath19 ) are included .",
    "linear and/or nonlinear terms in the staggered magnetization @xmath5 ( see below ) could also be added as needed to model other particular systems .",
    "however , the form given here is sufficient to demonstrate and validate the algorithm .",
    "in this section , we review some relevant basics of the wl method , followed by some current methods to obtain joint dos , and we explain why these methods are not appropriate to obtain @xmath7 for the system defined by the hamiltonian ( [ def_hamiltonian_2d_ising - asfl ] ) .",
    "these are mostly wl based methods .",
    "the wl method is a restricted random - walk method for finding the dos of a system .",
    "its idea is based on the observation that if one imposes an acceptance probability for proposed energy transitions in the random walk which is proportional to the _ reciprocal _ of the dos , then the system will spend roughly equal times in all different energy states .",
    "if a histogram @xmath20 is used to record the number of times that the walker visits each energy state , a ` flat ' histogram will eventually be generated .",
    "the whole random walk process is divided into many sweeps . in each sweep ,",
    "the estimated dos is multiplied by a modification factor , @xmath21 .",
    "the sweep is finished when a ` flat ' histogram is obtained . then , the next sweep starts with a smaller value of @xmath22 .",
    "the whole process ends when @xmath23 . to speed up the simulation , a wide energy spectrum",
    "may be divided into separate energy windows , with separate simulations performed in each window .",
    "the partitioned windows may be uniform @xcite or nonuniform @xcite .",
    "as errors are generated near the window boundaries @xcite whenever proposed moves outside the window are rejected , neighboring energy windows should overlap by a certain fraction , and the estimated @xmath24 obtained in neighboring windows should be joined at the point where their slopes with respect to @xmath3 are closest , so that a smooth @xmath24 over the whole energy spectrum can be obtained . in complex systems with rugged energy landscapes , states that lie in the same energy window may sometimes be connected only by paths that go via a different window .",
    "therefore , the replica exchange wang - landau ( rewl ) scheme @xcite was proposed to ensure that all microstates are visited .",
    "the scheme allows two walkers that both have energies within the overlap region of adjacent windows to exchange their microstates with a certain probability , so that ergodicity is preserved .",
    "rewl is performed in parallel @xcite .",
    "errors and convergence of wl have also been studied @xcite .",
    "it was found that the statistical errors in @xmath25 are proportional to @xmath26 @xcite , and the fluctuations in the histogram are proportional to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath24 may be increased by using the @xmath28 algorithm @xcite . a mathematical generalization of the wl algorithm is the stochastic approximation monte carlo ( samc ) algorithm @xcite , which has also involved the concept used in the @xmath28 algorithm .",
    "recently , junghans _",
    "et al . _ have demonstrated that wl , statistical temperature molecular dynamics , and metadynamics are equivalent under consistent initial conditions and update rules @xcite .",
    "the basic wl method for finding the _ joint _ dos of a system , @xmath29 , is to perform a two - dimensional random walk in the @xmath30 space @xcite . however , this approach is quite slow . to speed up the simulation ,",
    "the system could be divided into multiple energy windows , with each window containing all the compatible @xmath31 , using replica - exchange to ensure that all the microstates are accessible in each energy window @xcite . however , if the _",
    "dos contains one more variable , like the @xmath7 we want to obtain here , the simulation will again become slow .",
    "here we performed several crude tests on the antiferromagnetic ising model with different system sizes using this method .",
    "we first adopt a strict ` flatness ' criterion similar to the original wl papers @xcite , which considers a histogram ` flat ' if for every state , the deviation in the histogram @xmath32 is less than @xmath33 from the average histogram . using parallel programming with the energy spectrum divided into 5 energy windows , with each window",
    "assigned 5 random walkers and 1 core , a @xmath34 ising system takes 23 min to finish the simulation , while an @xmath35 ising system takes 972 min ( @xmath36 16 hours ) .",
    "this approach obviously does not scale well with system size .",
    "a relaxed ` flatness ' criterion @xcite considers a histogram ` flat ' if the root - mean - square of the deviation from the average histogram is less then @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of accessible @xmath39 in the window . using this criterion significantly improves the convergence times , but it does not improve the scaling behavior of this approach ( see table  [ table_speed ] ) .",
    "a very rough estimate for the time it would take for an @xmath40 system to finish is @xmath41 years .",
    ".crude tests for the computational time to obtain @xmath7 , using wl with multi - dimensional random walk in phase space , with energy spectrum partitioned into windows plus replica - exchange @xcite .",
    "parallel programming was performed with each window assigned 1 core and 5 walkers .",
    "the histogram is considered to be ` flat ' if all the walkers satisfy the root - mean - square ` flatness ' criterion",
    "@xcite ( eq .  ( [ def_release_deviation1 ] ) ) . the time recorded includes the time for initializing the systems .",
    "the asterisks mark the cases in which too many windows were used for a small system . in general , changing the system size from @xmath42 to @xmath43 causes the simulation time to increase by a factor of 6 to 10 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_speed ]      another method to obtain a joint dos breaks the simulation into two stages of random walk @xcite . in the first stage , a normal wl process is carried out and @xmath24 is obtained .",
    "then , a second stage of random walk is performed with an acceptance probability of @xmath44 , but only @xmath32 is updated , i.e. @xmath24 remains unchanged .",
    "the joint dos is then obtained from @xmath45 we partition the first - stage wl process into 5 energy windows with replica exchange .",
    "each window has 5 walkers , and a separate core is assigned to each window . the strict ` flatness ' criterion requiring that every state @xmath39 does not deviate more than @xmath33 from the average histogram",
    "is adopted @xcite . in the second stage of random",
    "walk , each core is assigned a random walker in a random initial state , which can walk through the whole phase space .",
    "we set the number of time steps spent on stage 2 to be 10 times of that spent on stage 1 .",
    "this method is much faster than the previous method : an @xmath35 system can be finished in a few seconds , and even @xmath46 can be finished in 170 seconds if the walkers do not get ` stuck ' @xcite .",

    "the @xmath51 should be independent of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the deviations from ( a ) of the results shown in ( b ) to ( d ) imply that the two - stage method does not give correct results for the ising - asfl model , even for this small system size .",

    "@xmath51 should be independent of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "figures [ paper1_problem_of_2level ] ( b ) to ( d ) show that the results obtained by this method change significantly when @xmath14 and @xmath15 change , and all of them are quite different from the result obtained by exact combinatorial calculation in ( a ) .",
    "the reason for the differences can be explained as follows .",
    "consider applying the two - stage method to get the dos in terms of only two macroscopic variables , @xmath30 . in the second stage of the process , suppose a walker is trying to move from a phase point @xmath52 to a point @xmath53 , and then to a point @xmath54 .",
    "as these three points have the same energy , the moves will have the same acceptance probabilities , @xmath44 . in this sense , these moves will be similar to an unbiased random walk confined to an energy @xmath3 , and with the histogram corresponding to @xmath31 being recorded .",
    "thus , if the change in @xmath29 along @xmath31 for a given value of @xmath3 is not too large , the method should give good results .",
    "however , if @xmath29 changes significantly when @xmath31 changes , the method may not give correct statistics .",
    "unbiased sampling works for extremely small systems where the differences in @xmath24 are small , but the wl method is required if the differences are significant .",
    "the method can in principle be improved by doing separate wl simulation for each energy @xmath3 to find the statistics corresponding to @xmath31 , if ergodicity is not broken .",
    "this observation leads to the basic principle of our macroscopically constrained wl method . to preserve ergodicity and obtain @xmath7 for our system",

    "a kernel function is applied when one tries to update the histogram .",

    "the method employs many random walkers , each starting in a different energy state , and their results are combined to get @xmath6 . from this , they obtained the critical line and canonical averages of the order parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the tomographic entropic sampling method can not give correct results when the system size is large . in a study motivated by a network reliability problem ,",

    "moreover , we will here discuss several methods to simplify the computational process .",

    "if the joint dos for two macroscopic variables can be obtained directly by exact calculation , they should be chosen as @xmath31 and @xmath62 , so that the joint dos @xmath69 involves an exact factor , @xmath56 . however , when partitioning the simulations into different stages , one must be careful that in each stage , a simple method can be found to let the walker walk through the whole confined phase space , such that ergodicity is not broken .",
    "each time the walker performs a wl process with only one free macroscopic variable , the constrained dos , e.g. , @xmath71 , can be partitioned into different windows of @xmath72 , and then joined together smoothly through choosing the contact point with the most similar slopes with respect to @xmath72 as in rewl @xcite .    breaking down",
    "the single wl processes into many independent processes like this works fast and is more accurate compared to the methods discussed in sec .",

    "<S> a generalized approach to wang - landau simulations , macroscopically constrained wang - landau , is proposed to simulate the density of states of a system with multiple macroscopic order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the method breaks a multidimensional random - walk process in phase space into many separate , one - dimensional random - walk processes in well - defined subspaces . </S>",
    "<S> each of these random walks is constrained to a different set of values of the macroscopic order parameters . when the multi - variable density of states is obtained for one set of values of field - like model parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the density of states for any other values of these parameters can be obtained by a simple transformation of the total system energy . </S>",
    "<S> all thermodynamic quantities of the system can then be rapidly calculated at any point in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how to use the multi - variable density of states to draw the phase diagram , as well as order - parameter probability distributions at specific phase points , for a model spin - crossover material : an antiferromagnetic ising model with ferromagnetic long - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the field - like parameters in this model are an effective magnetic field and the strength of the long - range interaction . </S>"
