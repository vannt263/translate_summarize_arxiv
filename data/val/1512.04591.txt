    "tumorigenesis occurs as the result of inherited and acquired genetic , epigenetic and other abnormalities accumulated over a long period of time in otherwise normal cells @xcite .",
    "before we can typically detect the presence of a tumor , the cells are already competing for resources in a darwinian struggle for existence in tissues that progressively age and evolve .",
    "it is well established that the regenerative capacity of individual cells within a tumor , and their ability to traffic multi - directionally from the primary tumor to metastatic tumors all represent significant challenges associated with the efficacy of different cancer treatments and our resulting ability to control systemic spread of many soft - tissue cancers @xcite .",
    "details of the metastatic and evolutionary process are poorly understood , particularly in the subclinical stages when tumors are actively developing but not yet clinically visible @xcite . it could be argued that in order to truly understand cancer progression at the level in which quantitative predictions become feasible , it is necessary to understand how genetically and epigenetically heterogeneous populations of cells compete and evolve within the tumor environment well before the tumor is clinically detectable .",
    "additionally , a better understanding of how these populations develop resistance to specific therapies @xcite might help in developing optimal strategies to attack the tumor and slow disease progression .",
    "evolutionary game theory is perhaps the best quantitative framework for modeling evolution and natural selection .",
    "it is a dynamic version of classical game theory in which a game between two ( or more ) competitors is played repeatedly , giving each participant the ability to adjust their strategy based on the outcome of the previous string of games . while this may seem like a minor variant of classical ( static ) game theory , as developed by the mathematicians von neumann and morgenstern in the 1940 s @xcite , it is not . developed mostly by the mathematical biologists john maynard smith and george price in the 1970s @xcite and martin nowak and karl sigmund @xcite more recently , this dynamic generalization of classical game theory has proven to be one of the main quantitative tools available to evolutionary biologists ( with a mathematical bent ) whose goal is to understand natural selection in evolving populations . in this biological context , a strategy is not necessarily a deliberate course of action , but an inheritable trait @xcite . instead of identifying nash equilibria , as in the static setting @xcite ,",
    "one looks for evolutionary stable strategies ( ess ) and fixation probabilities @xcite of a subpopulation .",
    "this subpopulation might be traced to a specific cell with enhanced replicative capacity , for example , that has undergone a sequence of mutations and is in the process of clonally expanding @xcite .",
    "a relevant question in that case is what is the probability of fixation of that subpopulation ?",
    "more explicitly , how does one subpopulation invade another in a developing colony of cells ?",
    "one game in particular , the prisoner s dilemma game , has played a central role in cancer modeling ( as well as other contexts such as political science and economics ) @xcite .",
    "it was originally developed by flood , dresher and tucker in the 1950s as an example of a game which shows how rational players might not cooperate , even if it seems to be in their best interest to do so .",
    "the evolutionary version of the prisoner s dilemma game has thus become a paradigm for the evolution of cooperation among a group of selfish individuals and thus plays a key role in understanding and modeling the evolution of altruistic behavior @xcite .",
    "perhaps the best introductory discussion of these ideas is found in dawkins celebrated book , the selfish gene @xcite .",
    "the framework of evolutionary game theory allows the modeler to track the relative frequencies of competing subpopulations with different traits within a bigger population by defining mutual payoffs among pairs within the group .",
    "one can then define a fitness landscape over which the subpopulations evolve .",
    "the fitness of different phenotypes is frequency dependent and is associated with reproductive prowess , while the ` players ' in the evolutionary game compete selfishly for the largest share of descendants @xcite .",
    "our goal in this article is provide a brief introduction to how the prisoner s dilemma game can be used to model the interaction of competing subpopulations of cells , say healthy , and cancerous , in a developing tumor and beyond .",
    "an evolutionary game between two players is defined by a 2 x 2 payoff matrix which assigns a reward to each player ( monetary reward , vacation time , reduced time in jail , etc . ) on a given interaction .",
    "let us call the two players a and b. in the case of a prisoner s dilemma game between cell types in an evolving population of cells , let there be two subpopulations of cell types which we will call ` healthy ' , and ` cancerous ' .",
    "we can think of the healthy cells as the subpopulation that is cooperating , and the cancer cells as formerly cooperating cells that have defected via a sequence of somatic driver mutations .",
    "imagine a sequence of ` games ' played between two cells ( a and b ) selected at random from the population , but chosen in proportion to their prevalence in the population pool .",
    "think of a cancer - free organ or tissue as one in which a population of healthy cells are all cooperating , and the normal organ functions are able to proceed , with birth and death rates that statistically balance , so an equilibrium healthy population is maintained ( on average ) .",
    "now imagine a mutated cell introduced into the population with enhanced proliferative capability as encoded by its genome as represented as a binary sequence of 0 s and 1 s carrying forward its genetic information ( which is passed on to daughter cells ) . a schematic diagram associated with this process is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we can think of this cancer cell as a formerly cooperating cell that has defected and begins to compete against the surrounding population of healthy cells for resources and reproductive prowess .",
    "from that point forward , one can imagine tumor development to be a competition between two distinct competing subpopulations of cells , healthy ( cooperators ) and cancerous ( defectors ) .",
    "we are interested in the growth rates of a ` tumor ' made up of a collection of cancer cells within the entire population , or equivalently , we are interested in tracking the proportion of cancer cells , @xmath0 , vs. the proportion of healthy cells , @xmath1 , in a population of @xmath2 cells comprising the simulated tissue region .    to quantify how the interactions proceed , and how birth / death rates are ultimately assigned , we introduce the 2 x 2 prisoner s dilemma payoff matrix :    @xmath3    the essence of the prisoner s dilemma game is the two players compete against each other , and each has to decide what best strategy to adopt in order to maximize their payoff .",
    "this 2 x 2 matrix assigns the payoff ( e.g. reward ) to each player on each interaction .",
    "my options , as a strategy or , equivalently , as a cell type , are listed along the rows , with row 1 associated with my possible choice to cooperate , or equivalently my cell type being healthy , and row 2 associated with my possible choice to defect , or equivalently my cell type being cancerous .",
    "your options are listed down the columns , with column 1 associated with your choice to cooperate ( or you being a healthy cell ) , and column 2 associated with your choice to defect ( or you being a cancer cell ) .",
    "the analysis of a rational player in a prisoner s dilemma game runs as follows .",
    "i do not know what strategy you will choose , but suppose you choose to cooperate ( column 1 ) . in that case , i am better off defecting ( row 2 ) since i receive a payoff of 5 instead of 3 ( if i also cooperate ) .",
    "suppose instead you choose to defect ( column 2 ) .",
    "in that case , i am also better off defecting ( row 2 ) since i receive a payoff of 1 instead of 0 ( if i were to have cooperated ) .",
    "therefore , _ no matter what you choose , i am better off ( from a pure payoff point of view ) if i defect_. what makes this game such a useful paradigm for strategic interactions ranging from economics , political science , biology , and even psychology @xcite is the following additional observation . _ you will analyze the game in exactly the same way i did ( just switch the roles of me and you in the previous rational analysis ) , so you will also decide to defect no matter what i do_. the upshot if we both defect is that we will each receive a payoff of 1 , instead of each receiving a payoff of 3 if we had both chosen to cooperate .",
    "the defect - defect combination is a nash equilibrium @xcite , and yet it is sub - optimal for both players and for the system as a whole .",
    "rational thought rules out the cooperate - cooperate combination which would be better for each player ( 3 points each ) and for both players combined ( 6 points ) .",
    "in fact , the nash equilibrium strategy of defect - defect is the worst possible system wide choice , yielding a total payoff of 2 points , compared to the cooperate - defect or defect - cooperate combination , which yields a total payoff of 5 points , or the best system - wide strategy of cooperate - cooperate yielding a total payoff of 6 points .",
    "the game becomes even more interesting if it is played repeatedly @xcite , stochastically @xcite , and with spatial structure @xcite with each player allowed to decide what strategy to use on each interaction so as to accumulate a higher payoff than the competition over a sequence of @xmath2 games . in order to analyze this kind of",
    "an evolving set - up , a fitness function must be introduced based on the payoff matrix a. let us now switch our terminology so that the relevance to tumor cell kinetics becomes clear .",
    "when modeling cell competition , one has to be careful about the meaning of the term ` choosing a strategy ' .",
    "cells do not choose a strategy , but they do behave in different ways depending on whether they are normal healthy cells cooperating as a cohesive group , with birth and death rates that statistically balance , or whether they are cancer cells with an overactive cell division mechanism ( as triggered by the presence of oncogenes ) and an underactive ` break ' mechanism ( as triggered by the absence of tumor suppressor genes ) @xcite . in our context , it is not the strategies that evolve , as cells can not change type based on strategy ( only based on mutations ) , but the prevalence of each cell type in the population is evolving , with the winner identified as the sub - type that first saturates in the population .",
    "consider a population of @xmath2 cells driven by a stochastic birth - death process as depicted in figure [ fig1:fig1 ] , with red cells depicting cancer cells ( higher fitness ) and blue cells depicting healthy cells ( lower fitness , but cooperative ) .",

    "however , the growth curve would not show any distinct shape ( figure [ fig2 ] ( black ) ) , and might well become extinct after any number of cell divisions , as opposed to reaching saturation .",

    "the growth rate is not constant throughout the full history of tumor development , but after an initial period of exponential growth , the rate decelerates until the region saturates with cancer cells .",

    "how does this process occur ?          at the heart of how the prisoner s dilemma evolutionary game dictates birth and death rates which in turn control tumor growth , is the definition of cell fitness .",

    "as time progresses , the rings grow out , surrounding the inner breast ring . the first ring out shows the metastatic tumor distribution associated with first recurrence .",
    "the sector sizes represent the percentage of patients in this group . likewise , the second ring out represents the distribution of tumors on second recurrence , and so forth for the further rings out .",
    "hence , subsequent rings outward represent the tumor distributions as time progresses , with each patient history depicted on a ray going out from the center of the ring diagram .",
    "we caution that despite our usage of the term ` tree - ring ' diagrams for these representations , the thickness of the rings are all equal , hence do not reflect the time between subsequent recurrences ( timescales of progression are documented and modeled in @xcite ) .",
    "the power of the diagrams is that in one quick glance , one gains an appreciation for the statistical complexity of the disease @xcite . from them",
    ", one can also calculate the probability of the disease ` transitioning ' from one site to another as the disease progresses ( called transition probabilities ) .",
    "these can then be used to create a single markov transition matrix for each cancer type @xcite , which quantitatively encodes much of the information associated with the disease .",
    "figure 9b shows the markov transition graph from the last metastatic site to the deceased state for the cohort from figure [ fig9]a .",
    "the sites are ordered clockwise from the most probably last metastatic site , to the least probable .",
    "figures [ fig9]c and [ fig9]d show reduced markov diagrams @xcite for two specific important sub - groups of breast cancer patients , her2 + patients , and er-/her2- patients .",
    "generally speaking , her2 + patients have the poorest prognosis .",
    "the red sites in these reduced diagrams ( bone , lung / pleura , chest wall , ln ( mam ) ) in figure [ fig9]c , and bone , ln ( mam ) , chest wall in figure 9d are the spreaders associated with these groups . the blue sites ( liver , ln ( dist ) , brain for fig .",
    "[ fig9]c ; ln ( dist ) , lung / pleura , liver , brain for fig .",
    "[ fig9]d ) are the sponges @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that lung / pleura switches from a spreader in the her2 + sub - group to a sponge in the er-/her2- sub - group , suggesting a possible biological difference of the site in the different groups that correlates with different survival probabilities .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that no mathematical model captures all aspects of reality , so choices must be made which involve prioritizing the features that are most essential in capturing the essence of a complex process and which are not .",
    "most experts now agree that the evolutionary processes in a tumor played out among subpopulations of competing cells are key to understanding aspects of growth and resistance to chemotherapy , which will ultimately lead the way toward a quantitative understanding of tumor growth and cancer progression @xcite .",
    "the paradigm of the cancer cell subpopulation and the healthy cell subpopulation competing as the defectors and cooperators in a prisoner s dilemma evolutionary game has been useful in obtaining a quantitative handle on many of these processes and frames the problem in an intuitive yet predictive way .",
    "nonetheless , the mathematical ` taste ' of the modeler plays a role in what techniques are selected and ultimately where the spotlight shines .",
    "this fact makes clinicians uncomfortable and can lead to deep suspicion of the mathematical modeling enterprise as a whole .",
    "are nt the outcomes and predictions of mathematical models a straightforward consequence of the model assumptions ?",
    "once those choices are made , is nt the cake already baked ?",
    "so why should we be surprised if you tell us it tastes good ?",
    "why not simply use tried and true statistical tools like regression methods to curve - fit the data directly , with no built in assumptions , and be satisfied with uncovering correlations and trends ? clinicians ( and experimentalists , in general ) feel that they are dealing directly with reality , so why mess around with ` toy ' systems based on possibly ` ad hoc ' or incorrect assumptions that create artificial realities that may or may not be relevant ? to a theoretician , calling their assumptions ad hoc , as opposed to natural , is as insulting as calling a clinician sloppy and uncaring ( try this for yourself at the next conference you go to ! but please use the term ` somewhat ad hoc ' to lessen the blow . ) and if you want to deliver an even harsher insult , you could comment that the model seems like an exercise in curve fitting .",
    "but the usefulness of mathematical models built on simplified assumptions is well established in the history of the physical sciences , as detailed beautifully in peter dear s book , _ the intelligibility of nature : how science makes sense of the world _ @xcite .",
    "bohr s simple model of the structure of the atom was crucial in moving the community forward towards a deeper understanding of cause and effect , and ultimately pushing others to develop more realistic atomic models .",
    "the same could be said for many other important , but ultimately discarded models of reality ( e.g. the notion of aether used as a vehicle to understand the mysterious notion of action - at - a - distance @xcite ) now relegated to footnotes in the history of the physical sciences .",
    "lessons from this history highlight the importance of using the principle of occam s razor ( law of parsimony ) as a heuristic guide in developing models : ( 1 ) keep things simple , but not too simple ; ( 2 ) see what can be explained by using a given set of assumptions , and try to identify what is either wrong or can not be explained ; ( 3 ) add complexity to the model , but do this carefully .",
    "since ultimately , the model will always be wrong ( with respect to some well chosen and specific new question being posed about a system ) , it is important that it be _ useful as a vehicle of intelligibility _ @xcite associated with the set of questions surrounding the phenomena it was built to explain .",
    "answers to some new questions will be found using the model as a temporary crutch , and new questions will emerge in the process that had not yet been asked , as their relevance had never previously been realized .",
    "a new quantitative language will emerge in which aspects of the model will be associated with the underlying reality it is attempting to describe , predictions will be easier to frame and test , and shortcomings will be exposed . in his famous article @xcite , eugene wigner writes compellingly that ` the miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve",
    ". we should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend , for better or for worse , to our pleasure , even though perhaps also to our bafflement , to wide branches of learning . '    in general , the more complex the model ( as measured , for example , by the number of independent parameters associated with it ) , the less useful it will be , and the less likely it is to be adopted by the community at large .",
    "after all , if the model is as complex as the phenomena it was built to understand , why not stick with reality ?",
    "effective models can be thought of as _ low - dimensional approximations of reality _ , surrogates that help us bootstrap our way forward .",
    "they arise as the outcome of a complex balancing act between simplicity of the ingredients , and complexity of the reality the model is meant to describe .",
    "they generally do not arise in a vacuum , but are built in the context of informed and sustained discussions among people with different expertise . in the context of medical oncology ,",
    "this means physical scientists developing ongoing interactions with clinical oncologists , radiologists , pathologists , molecular and cell biologists and other relevant medical specialists .",
    "appropriate data is a necessary ingredient in developing and testing any successful model , and treasure troves of medical data sit unexamined in patient files and government databases across the country waiting to be put to good use .",
    "there is no doubt that they are telling an interesting and important story that we have yet to fully understand .",
    "it is not currently possible for the computer to simulate all of the complex , relevant , and systemic ingredients at play to faithfully recreate all aspects of cancer progression and treatment response in patients .",
    "it is hard to imagine that a deep and actionable understanding can ever be obtained without the combined use of data , models , and computer simulations to help guide us and highlight some of the underlying causal mechanisms of this complex and deadly disease ."
