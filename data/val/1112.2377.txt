    "a major goal of materials science is to predict the macroscopic properties of materials from their microscopic structure . for this purpose ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the behavior of defects in these materials .",
    "we propose a computational tool , the energy - based blended quasicontinuum method ( bqce ) , for simulating defects such as cracks , dislocations , vacancies , and interstitials in crystalline materials .    accurate modeling of the region near a defect requires the use of computationally expensive atomistic models .",
    "such models are practical only for small problems .",
    "however , a defect may interact with a large region of the material through long - range elastic fields .",
    "thus , accurate simulation of defects requires the use of a large computational domain ; typically , the size required rules out the use of atomistic models for the entire region of interest .    fortunately , the long - range elastic fields generated by a defect are well described by continuum models which can be efficiently computed using the finite - element method .",
    "thus , defects can be accurately and efficiently simulated by coupled models which use an atomistic model near the defect and a continuum model elsewhere .",
    "we call any such model an _ atomistic - to - continuum coupling_.    many atomistic - to - continuum couplings have been proposed in recent years @xcite ; see  @xcite for a survey of atomistic - to - continuum couplings and computational benchmark tests .",
    "these couplings fall into two major classes : energy - based and force - based .",
    "energy - based couplings provide an approximation to the atomistic energy of a configuration of atoms .",
    "force - based couplings provide a non - conservative force - field which approximates the forces on each atom under the atomistic model .",
    "our bqce method is an energy - based coupling .",
    "both types of couplings have intrinsic advantages ; the development of energy - based couplings is especially important for finite - temperature applications since equilibrium statistical properties and transition rates can be directly approximated  @xcite .    here , and throughout",
    ", we only consider _ concurrent _ coupling methods .",
    "an alternative approach are upscaling methods such as  @xcite , which achieve increased resolution near defects by adding finer scales to a coarse scale description rather than by decomposing space into fine ( atomistic ) and coarse ( continuum ) scale models .",
    "the primary source of error for most ( concurrent ) energy - based couplings is the _ ghost force_. we say that a coupling suffers from ghost forces if it predicts non - zero forces on the atoms in a perfect lattice .",
    "although many attempts have been made to develop an energy - based coupling free from ghost forces such couplings are currently known only for a limited range of problems @xcite .",
    "method @xcite applies to one and two - dimensional simple crystals with an atomistic energy based on a pair interaction model , and can be extended to 3d if a modified `` continuum model '' is used @xcite .",
    "gr - ac was proposed in @xcite , and has recently been implemented for a two dimensional crystal with nearest neighbor many - body interactions in @xcite .",
    "no ghost force free methods are currently known for three - dimensional crystals , for multi - lattice crystals ( except in 1d @xcite ) , or for atomistic models with general many - body interactions .",
    "the field - based coupling of iyer and gavini @xcite is another interesting approach ; however , it is unclear at present whether it is competitive in terms of computational complexity and generality .    in our bqce method ,",
    "the ghost forces can not be eliminated but can be controlled in terms of an additional approximation parameter ( the blending width )  @xcite .",
    "bqce applies to a wide range of problems for which no ghost force free methods are known ; these problems include three - dimensional crystals with general many - body interactions as well as multi - lattices .",
    "this makes it an attractive method for such challenging and physically important problems .",
    "the key feature of bqce is a _ blending region _ where the atomistic and continuum contributions to the total energy are smoothly mixed .",
    "the ghost forces of the bqce method can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the size of this blending region  @xcite .",
    "bqce shares the idea of a blending region with the bridging domain method  @xcite , the atc coupling  @xcite , and the arlequin  method  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the energy - based quasicontinuum method ( qce ) @xcite , shapeev s method @xcite , and gr - ac @xcite exhibit an abrupt transition between the atomistic and continuum models .",
    "we call any method with a blending region a _ blended method _ , and we call the weights which mix the atomistic and continuum contributions to the energy a _ blending function_.    both the bridging domain method and atc coupling are very general formulations , each of them incorporating bqce and qce as special cases .",
    "our bqce formulation provides a set of specific instructions for the successful implementation of a blended method .",
    "we identify two important practical differences between bqce and the bridging domain and atc coupling methods .",
    "first , the bqce method specifies a strong coupling between the atomistic and continuum regions , whereas weak couplings based on lagrange multipliers or the penalty method have been used in most work involving the bridging domain and atc coupling methods .",
    "second , in bqce , we blend the atomistic site - energy with a continuum site - energy based on the continuum site - energy defined in some formulations of the qce method ( see section  [ sec : coarse grained continuum energy ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that bqce correctly predicts the total energy of a perfect lattice subjected to uniform strain .",
    "our approach to blending is supported by rigorous analysis . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the ghost force error of bqce in 1d does indeed decrease with the size of the blending region , and we found that the error is minimized when the blending function is a hermite cubic - spline .",
    "we also found that the error of the bqce method in predicting lattice instabilities can be reduced by increasing the size of the blending region .    in this paper",
    ", we have extended the atom - based formulation given for 1d problems in @xcite to a volume - based multid formulation that allows finite element coarse - graining in the continuum region .",
    "the implementation of bqce requires the choice of two approximation parameters : a _ blending function _ @xmath0 and a finite - element mesh @xmath1 which is used to compute the continuum contribution to the energy . in section  [ sec : complexity ] , we give optimal choices of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to minimize global error norms for the problem of a point defect in a 2d crystal , based on theoretical results in @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the validity of these results in computational test problems in which we simulate a microcrack ( see figure [ fig : mcrack ] ) and a di - vacancy .      in sections  [ sec : atomistic energy ] and",
    "[ sec : coarse grained continuum energy ] , we introduce an atomistic model for simple lattices with general many - body interactions and its corresponding continuum cauchy  born approximation . in section",
    "[ sec : bqce ] , we give a precise formulation of bqce in this setting . in section  [ sec : complexity ] , we offer guiding principles on choosing the blending function @xmath0 and the mesh @xmath1 based on our analysis in  @xcite .",
    "the results of this analysis are summarized in table  [ tab : complexity bqce ] . in section  [ sec",
    ": num ] , we describe the details of our numerical experiment .",
    "we use an atomistic energy based on the embedded atom method .",
    "we did not choose our atomistic energy to model any specific physical material ; instead , the atomistic energy is a toy model chosen for its simplicity .",
    "the observed rates of convergence are in agreement with the rates predicted in section  [ sec : complexity ] .",
    "in particular , the error of bqce in the @xmath2 semi - norm decreases as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss open questions concerning local quantities of interest in the concluding section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "let @xmath5 be a @xmath6-dimensional bravais lattice .",
    "we call @xmath5 the _ reference lattice_. in the present work , we consider only _ monatomic crystals_. that is , we assume that each site of the lattice @xmath5 is the reference position of a single atom , and that all atoms are identical .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of _ deformations _ of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a finite subset of @xmath5 .",
    "we call @xmath9 the _ atomistic computational domain_.    in the embedded atom method ( eam ) @xcite , the energy of @xmath9 subjected to deformation @xmath10 takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a pair potential , @xmath13 is an electron density function , and @xmath14 is an embedding function .",
    "we call the inner sum @xmath15 the _ atomistic site - energy of atom @xmath16_. we observe that the sum defining the energy of an atom is finite in practice even though summation ranges over the infinite lattice @xmath5 .",
    "this is because the pair potential @xmath12 and electron density function @xmath13 are taken to have a _",
    "cut - off radius _",
    "@xmath17 such that @xmath18    for defining the atomistic model and the bqce method , we can in fact consider a more general class of potentials than eam .",
    "we only require that the total energy can be decomposed into a sum of localized site - energies associated with each atom . by _ localized _ , we mean that the energy associated with an atom @xmath16 does not depend on the positions of atoms beyond a certain cut - off distance .",
    "such an assumption may be violated for certain energies arising from quantum mechanics , but does hold for most empirical potentials including eam , the bond - angle potentials , and so forth .",
    "in addition , we require that the site - energies are _ homogeneous _ ; that is , the energies of atoms which have the same local environment are the same .    to make these assumptions precise , we let @xmath19 denote the site - energy associated with atom @xmath16 under deformation @xmath10 and require that it is of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the site - energy potential .",
    "we assume that the resulting site - energies are twice continuously differentiable , that is , @xmath22 .",
    "the restricted dependence of @xmath23 on atoms within the cut - off radius may also be expressed in the form @xmath24 this quantifies the requirement that the site - energy is localized .",
    "given @xmath23 we define the energy of @xmath9 subjected to a deformation @xmath10 by @xmath25 we call an energy of the form   where @xmath23 satisfies   _ homogeneous_. when we define the cauchy  born strain energy density corresponding to   in section  [ sec : coarse grained continuum energy ] , we use that @xmath26 is homogeneous : if @xmath26 is not homogeneous , the energy per unit volume in a perfect lattice subjected to uniform strain may be more difficult to obtain ( see @xcite and references therein for examples ) .",
    "the locality assumption can , in principle , be replaced by an assumption that the interaction strength decays sufficiently rapidly with increasing distance between atoms .",
    "homogeneity of the site - energy is our main assumption that is violated for multi - lattices .",
    "we show in @xcite how to generalize our formulation for that scenario .",
    "bqce is a coupling of an atomistic energy based on   with a coarse - grained continuum elastic energy based on the cauchy  born strain energy density  .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the voronoi cell of a site @xmath28 .",
    "then the cauchy  born strain energy density @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath21 is defined by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the homogeneous deformation @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 may be interpreted as the energy per unit volume in @xmath5 subjected to strain @xmath34 .",
    "note that the assumption of homogeneity ensures that @xmath35 for all @xmath28 .",
    "we will use the cauchy  born strain energy density   to derive a coarse - grained continuum energy suitable for coupling with the atomistic energy  .",
    "first , we define a space of coarse - grained deformations .",
    "let @xmath36 denote a set of _ representative atoms ( repatoms ) _ , let @xmath1 be a triangulation with vertices @xmath37 , and let @xmath38 denote the set of all functions @xmath39 that are continous and piecewise affine with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "we call @xmath38 the set of _ coarse - grained deformations_. the cauchy  born energy of a deformation @xmath40 in a domain @xmath41 is then given by @xmath42 the cauchy ",
    "born approximation is analyzed , for example , in @xcite .    the definition of the qce method @xcite and our construction of the bqce method in the next section use a cauchy  born site - energy @xmath43 , which is analogous to the atomistic site - energy @xmath23 . for @xmath44 and @xmath45",

    "we observe that the sum on the right hand side of equation   is finite because only finitely many elements @xmath49 can intersect @xmath27 .",
    "the bqce method is an atomistic - to - continuum coupling based on the qce method of tadmor _ et al .",

    "moreover , our formulation in terms of atomistic and continuum energies per atom guarantees that the bqce energy is exact under homogenous deformations .    the bqce energy can be rewritten in the form @xmath57 where the _ bqce - effective volume _ of the element @xmath48 is defined by @xmath58    [ rem : triangulation need not cover lattice ] the triangulation @xmath1 need not cover the entire domain @xmath9 . for",

    "it is possible that the use of a mesh which is not refined to atomistic scale may make the implementation of bqce easier and more efficient in some cases .",
    "if one interprets a multi - lattice as a simple lattice with a basis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , then the formulation of the atomistic energy and of the bqce energy require no changes .",
    "the only difference is that in the general multi - lattice case , the site energy @xmath65 has fewer symmetries ( however , see@xcite for examples with high symmetry ) .",
    "a typical application of the bqce method is the simulation of a defect or defect region in an infinite crystal . to that end , we require far - field boundary conditions at the domain boundary . we propose two choices .",

    "we then solve the problem @xmath72 where we interpret @xmath73 as the set of _ local _ minimizers of @xmath74 .",
    "a popular method to construct artificial far - field boundary conditions is to formulate the problem in a periodic cell . to that end , suppose that @xmath75 , @xmath1 is periodic , and let @xmath76 be the finite element mesh on one periodic cell .",
    "that is , suppose that for some nonsingular matrix @xmath77 whose columns are elements of @xmath5 , we have @xmath78 and that the union is disjoint .",
    "let @xmath79 be nonsingular , and call @xmath34 a _ macroscopic strain_. given @xmath34 , we define the admissible set as @xmath80 the associated variational problem can again be stated as .",

    "if the size of the periodic cell is large , periodic boundary conditions with macroscopic strain @xmath34 approximate far - field boundary conditions with uniform strain @xmath34 imposed at infinity .",
    "note that , while we only discuss a static formulation , we see no obstacle that prevents both our formulation and analysis to apply also to _ quasi - static _ problems , in which the energy is minimized at each loading step . however , we stress that further careful analysis is required to understand the accuracy , in particular stability , of the bqce method as the deformation approaches bifurcation points ( e.g. , as in the formation or motion of crystal defects or the propagation of a crack ) .      in section [ sec : complexity ] , we present error estimates for the bqce method in terms of the _ computational complexity _",

    "since the precomputation of @xmath163 is computationally cheap and straightforward , we nevertheless propose the choice @xmath164 for most simulations .",
    "finally , we remark that the initial dip in the energy error in figure  [ fig : mcrack_erre ] is most likely due to a change of sign in the energy error .",
    "we perform a second numerical experiment , in order to demonstrate that the effects we observed in the microcrack example , which are not covered by our theory , are indeed caused by a pre - asymptotic regime . to this end",
    "we consider a di - vacancy defect , where only two neighboring sites @xmath165 are removed from the lattice .",

    "we now observe precisely the rates of convergence @xmath169 and @xmath170 predicted by our theory .",

    "this example clearly demonstrates that an atomistic coarse - graining scheme need not always lead to improved computational results , but that the improvement over a judiciously performed atomistic simulation is highly problem dependent .",

    "an interesting open question is how well different atomistic - to - continuum couplings ( in particular , qce , bqce and the patch test consistent methods ) perform if the quantity of interest is localized in the atomistic region . in  @xcite",

    "the authors concluded that the local error of the arlequin method could be controlled by moving the blending region away from the defect and increasing its size .",
    "for the quasicontinuum method , local quantities of interest were investigated in @xcite .",
    "we hope to develop rigorous error estimates and optimal approximation parameters for localized quantities of interest in a future work .    at present bqce",
    "is a competitive choice for numerical simulations of atomistic multi - scale problems as it applies to a much broader class than any known patch test consistent method .",
