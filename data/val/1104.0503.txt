    "graphene is a newly accessible nanomaterial  @xcite , consisting of a single sheet of carbon atoms forming a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .",
    "the valence ( highest occupied ) and conduction ( lowest unoccupied ) bands of graphene are touching at the @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( and equivalent ) points in the brillouin zone and exhibit a conical shape of their dispersion in the vicinity of these special ( dirac ) points  @xcite .",
    "graphene is a promising candidate for applications in future micro- and nanoelectronics due to its excellent mechanical characteristics , scalability to nanometer sizes , and the ability to sustain huge electric currents  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have confirmed that the charge carriers in graphene indeed behave like massless dirac fermions  @xcite .",
    "although graphene exhibits excellent conducting properties , the absence of an energy gap poses a challenge for realizing conventional semiconductor device operations in this material .",
    "a possible way to alleviate this situation is to induce a gap in the electronic spectrum at the fermi energy by breaking the discrete sublattice symmetry of the honeycomb structure . in recent experiments  @xcite",
    "was reported that hydrogenation of the graphene sheet breaks the sublattice degeneracy .",
    "reversibility of this process enables switching between conducting and insulating regimes of a graphene sample , and spatial addressability should make the fabrication of hybrid conducting - insulating graphene samples possible .",
    "the opening of a uniform gap destroys graphene s metallic state , as the ac ( optical ) conductivity vanishes for photon energies smaller than the band gap . in real samples ,",
    "the gap may be random , e.g. , because of structural variability in the physical system .",
    "for example , the bonds with hydrogen atoms could undergo temporal and spatial variations . to understand this practical issue , and also for more fundamental reasons , studies of _ static _ random - gap disorder in dirac - fermion systems",
    "have been performed  @xcite , where a staggered potential was considered as a possible model for breaking the sublattice symmetry of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "our work presented here augments these previous investigations by considering the effect of a spatially uniform mass gap that fluctuates _ in time_. besides clarifying the respective nature of temporal and spatial randomness in the mass gap , which is an issue of basic interest , the scenario considered by us would be realized in graphene samples where sublattice - potential - inducing agents are undergoing large - scale random variations .",
    "below we argue that a more general spatio - temporal random variation of a staggered sublattice potential in graphene can be represented , to leading order , by a markovian model where the low - energy dirac - fermion theory has a random mass gap described by white - noise fluctuations .",
    "we use this model to derive our stochastic equation of motion for the disordered - graphene system and incorporate the nontrivial time evolution into the framework of linear - response theory .",
    "thus a generalized kubo formula is obtained for the optical conductivity , enabling us to unambiguously determine how electric transport is affected by the mean value and the variance of the fluctuating potential .",
    "this is a useful result because the optical conductivity is an experimentally accessible quantity  @xcite that depends strongly on the electronic properties of the material .",
    "in particular , it can be used to determine the size of a band gap  @xcite since transport is suppressed for photon energies smaller than the gap .",
    "we find that the dc conductivity at finite temperature is monotonously decreasing as a function of the variance of mass - gap fluctuations .",
    "however , for an intermediate range of frequency below the cut - off equivalent to the average gap , fluctuations _ enhance _ the conductivity . this observation should be contrasted with the related increase of the conductivity with variance of _ static _ mass - gap fluctuations in graphene samples of finite size  @xcite .",

    "the interaction with the states of the reservoir generates fluctuation , and a short explanation of the technical details is given in [ app ] .",
    "in the context of the open quantum system ( subsystem and reservoir ) , we consider the tight - binding hamiltonian for electrons in graphene subject to a sublattice - staggered potential , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) on site @xmath7 on sublattice @xmath8 ( an equivalent definition is used for @xmath9 , @xmath10 on sublattice @xmath11 ) , @xmath12ev is the nearest - neighbor hopping energy between different sublattices . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are spin - independent potentials with @xmath15 on sublattice @xmath8 and @xmath16 on sublattice @xmath11 .",

    "@xcite , values for @xmath20 at different lattice sites could be correlated .",
    "we make the assumption that the random variables are uncorrelated for different lattice sites and the value of the average gap ( averaging locally ) is the same for each lattice site .",

    "we remind the reader that the static disorder models discuss only spatial correlations between different lattice sites .",
    "the aforementioned description given by us could deal with local ( temporal fluctuations ) and spatial correlations , too .",
    "however , in the present paper we consider a complementary case to the static disorder models . our model for randomness",
    "is given by the relation @xmath21 , and it is clear that an average over the local fluctuations leads to a spatially uncorrelated variable @xmath24 .",

    "this allows us to consider the presence of randomness for each valley separately .",
    "the fact that electrons in graphene also carry a real spin introduces an additional double degeneracy of all eigenvalues for the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) . in the following , we study the dynamics due to the single - valley , spin - less model defined by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) and absorb degeneracy factors into our basic unit of conductivity .",
    "as the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) contains a random variable , the time evolution induced by it can not be expressed by the usual equations . instead , a quantum - stochastic calculus has to applied .",
    "a brief introduction to that is presented in the following .",
