    "acquiring knowledge about a sampled space from a point data has become a key problem in many areas of science and engineering .",
    "the sampled space could be a hidden manifold sitting in some high dimensions , or could be a compact subset of some euclidean space .",
    "topological information such as the rank of the homology groups , or their persistent behavior can divulge important features of the hidden space .",
    "therefore , a considerable effort has ensued to extract topological information from point data in recent years  @xcite . with the advent of advanced technologies ,",
    "the data is often generated in abundance .",
    "mixed with the burden of high dimensionality , large data sets pose a challenge to the processing resource . as a result ,",
    "some recent investigations have focused on how to use a lighter data structure or sparsify the input which aids a faster computation , but still guarantees that the output inference is correct .",
    "point data by themselves do not have interesting topology .",
    "so , a foremost step in topology inference is to impose a structure such as a simplicial complex onto it .",
    "the delaunay , ech , vietoris - rips , and witness complexes are some of the most commonly proposed complexes for this purpose . among these ,",
    "vietoris - rips ( rips in short ) and witness complexes  @xcite have been favored because they can be constructed with simple computations .",
    "rips complexes are easy to construct as they can be built from a graph by recognizing the cliques in it .",
    "however , the presence of simplices corresponding to all cliques makes its size quite large . even in three dimensions with a few thousand points ,",
    "the size of the rips complex can be an obstacle , if not a stopper , for further processing .",
    "witness complexes , on the other hand , have too few simplices to capture the topology of the sampled space in dimensions three or more  @xcite . to tackle this issue , boissonnat et al .",
    "@xcite suggested modifications to the original definition of witness complex  @xcite .",
    "this enlarges the witness complexes but makes it more complicated and costly to compute .",
    "we investigate a new complex , a version of which was originally introduced in  @xcite for the application of sensor network routing .",
    "we set up a more general definition and call it the _ graph induced complex_. we provide new theoretical understanding of the graph induced complex in terms of topology inference . in particular , we show that , when equipped with appropriate metric , this complex can decipher the topology from data .",
    "it retains the simplicity of the rips complex as well as the sparsity of the witness complex .",
    "its construction resembles the sparsified rips complex proposed in  @xcite and also the combinatorial delaunay triangulation proposed in  @xcite , but it does not build a rips complex on the subsample and thus is sparser than the rips complex with the same set of vertices .",
    "this fact makes a real difference in practice as our preliminary experiments show .",
    "the idea of graph induced complex also bears similarity to the geodesic delaunay triangulation which was proposed to recover the topology of a bounded planar region ( with holes ) from point samples @xcite .",
    "our work extends it , as well as investigates its theoretical properties , to more general setting beyond the planar case .",
    "given a graph @xmath0 on a point data @xmath1 equipped with a metric , one can build a graph induced complex on a subsample @xmath2 by throwing in a simplex with a vertex set @xmath3 if a set of points in @xmath1 , each being closest to exactly one vertex in @xmath4 , forms a clique .",
    "figure  [ fig : gic ] shows a graph induced complex for a point data in the plane .",
    "subsampled points are the darker vertices .",
    "input points are grouped according to the proximity to the subsampled vertices ( indicated with a voronoi partition ) .",
    "the shaded triangle enlarged on right is in the graph induced complex since there is a @xmath5-clique in the input graph whose 3 vertices have 3 different closest point in the subsample .",
    "observe that , in this example , the graph induced complex has the same homology as the sampled space . figure  [ fig : comparison ] shows experimental results on two data sets , 40,000 sample points from a klein bottle in @xmath6 and 15,000 sample points from the primary circle of natural image data considered in @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the graphs connecting any two points within @xmath8 unit distance for klein bottle and @xmath9 unit distance for the primary circle were taken as input for the graph induced complexes .",
    "the @xmath10-skeleton of the rips complexes for these @xmath11 parameters have @xmath12 and @xmath13 simplices respectively .",
    "these sizes are too large to carry out fast computations .    [",

    "we observe that the overall setup in section  [ surface - topoinfer ] for inferring @xmath19-homology from the graph induced complex generalizes easily to higher dimensions . the inclusion map @xmath20 still induces an isomorphism at the homology level if @xmath11 and @xmath21 are chosen appropriately . in that case",
    ", the map @xmath22 remains injective by the same argument as before .",
    "the main trouble arises when we try to prove that it is also surjective .",
    "observe that , to prove the surjectivity of @xmath23 , we used the fact that the restricted voronoi cell @xmath24 in @xmath25 is connected ( proposition  [ rips - connect ] ) . unfortunately , this is not necessarily true in high dimensions given the counterexamples in  @xcite . to overcome this impediment we change the distance function replacing the euclidean distance with the graph distance while building @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , we still consider @xmath27 to be the graph connecting points in @xmath1 with euclidean distance @xmath11 or less , but take @xmath28 to be a @xmath21-sparse @xmath21-sample of @xmath29 where the graph distance @xmath30 is defined with the euclidean lengths as the edge weights .",
