    "using amplitude equations and assuming that the properties of acoustic modes ( saturation coefficients ) are the same , one may show that in this case the amplitude drops by a factor @xmath30 as compared to single - mode saturation amplitude predicted by hydrodynamic model .",
    "the agreement with pulsation amplitudes of multi - periodic @xmath1  cep stars is obtained with only a fraction of the available ( linearly unstable ) modes . in principle",
