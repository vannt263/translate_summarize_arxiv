    "the spontaneous emission rate of an atom depends on the environment with which it is coupled . changing the atom environment",
    "substantially alters the density of states , leading to suppression or enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "this phenomenon was first predicted by purcell in his seminal work @xcite . when the atom is coupled on - resonance with a cavity ,",
    "its relaxation rate is enhanced @xcite due to increased vacuum fluctuations at the atom frequency . on the other hand ,",
    "if the atom is off - resonant from the cavity frequency , the spontaneous emission rate can be significantly suppressed @xcite .    a very similar effect @xcite ( thus often called the purcell effect ) occurs in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) systems @xcite when a superconducting qubit ( artificial atom ) is coupled to a microwave resonator , which in turn is coupled to a transmission line .",
    "the qubit energy relaxation via the resonator is one of the main processes limiting the qubit lifetime .",
    "as demonstrated experimentally @xcite , even coupling with resonator modes that are far detuned from the qubit frequency can significantly reduce the qubit lifetime .",
    "the purcell effect is also one of the limiting factors in achieving a high - fidelity qubit readout .",
    "several proposals have been put forward to reduce or eliminate the resonator - induced qubit relaxation rate ( purcell rate ) either by designing a purcell filter @xcite , engineering a purcell - protected qubit @xcite , or using a tunable coupler @xcite that decouples the transmission line from the resonator during the qubit - resonator interaction , thereby avoiding the purcell effect altogether @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze the effect of an external microwave drive on the qubit relaxation rate caused by the loss of photons to the resonator environment .",
    "it is known @xcite that the external drive can increase the qubit relaxation rate ( and also cause qubit excitation ) due to the `` dressed dephasing '' effect , which essentially converts pure dephasing into photon - number - dependent energy relaxation ( the dressed dephasing was observed experimentally @xcite ) . in our analysis",
    "we assume the absence of pure dephasing , so that there is no dressed dephasing , and we can focus on the question of how the standard purcell effect changes in the presence of an additional drive . in spite of the general importance of this question , we are not aware of any direct discussion of the purcell effect in the presence of drive , except for an indirect analysis in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we consider a superconducting qubit coupled to a resonator , which can leak photons into a transmission line ( fig .",
    "[ fig - model ] ) .",
    "the resonator is driven on resonance by an external microwave field , while the qubit is significantly detuned from the resonator frequency , so that there is no direct effect of the drive on the qubit .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of microwave photons in the resonator ( with average number @xmath0 ) may affect the qubit relaxation rate .",
    "naively , we might expect that the qubit relaxation rate should scale approximately as @xmath1 with increasing drive , because the effective interaction between the qubit and resonator scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of excitations in the system .",
    "however , this is not correct : the purcell rate does not increase with @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to understand this fact using a picture of an almost linear interaction between the qubit and resonator , so that the photons at the resonator frequency do not affect the evolution of the qubit excitation , which is at the qubit frequency .",
    "our calculations confirm that the purcell rate does not increase with @xmath0 even in the strongly nonlinear regime ( when @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the so - called critical photon number @xcite  see later ) .",
    "in fact , somewhat surprisingly , we find the opposite effect : the qubit decay rate _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from an analytic formula , obtained in a simple intuitive approach . in the slightly nonlinear regime ( when @xmath6 ) this formula",
    "is confirmed using a formal approach based on a dispersive expansion of the interaction hamiltonian ; the formula is also confirmed by a numerical simulation in a wider range of nonlinearity .",
    "the suppression of the relaxation rate becomes significant ( it may exceed an order of magnitude ) when increasing @xmath0 brings the interaction into the strongly nonlinear regime ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have also found that besides the energy relaxation , in the presence of the microwave drive , the qubit may experience excitation as a result of photon loss to the resonator environment . in the moderately nonlinear regime",
    "the excitation rate grows with @xmath0 , but remains much smaller than the relaxation rate .",
    "the simple analytics and formal analysis for the relaxation as well as the excitation rate agree well with the numerical results .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii we start with reviewing the standard purcell effect in the absence of a microwave drive .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the purcell rate in the presence of the drive analytically in two ways : using a simple approach and using a formal master equation approach .",
    "the analytical results are compared with the numerical results in sec.iv .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v is the conclusion .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the purcell rate calculation @xcite by considering a qubit coupled to a resonator in the absence of a microwave drive . in this case",
    ", there are only three ( bare ) states involved in the evolution : @xmath8 , and @xmath9 or @xmath10 represents the resonator state with 0 or 1 photon .",
    "we assume that the system is initially in the state @xmath11 or a superposition of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then the qubit - resonator coupling causes coherent oscillations between the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; however , leakage of the photon to the resonator environment eventually causes irreversible relaxation to the system ground state @xmath14 ( note that in some cases the purcell relaxation can be considered as a coherent process @xcite ) .    )",
    "coupled to the resonator , with coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "the resonator decays with the rate @xmath16 , which causes the energy relaxation ( purcell relaxation ) of the qubit . in a circuit qed qubit measurement setup ,",
    "a microwave ( rf ) drive with resonant frequency @xmath17 and normalized amplitude @xmath18 is applied to the resonator .",
    "we show that the qubit relaxation rate decreases with increasing strength of this drive , and that there exists a relatively weak qubit excitation .",
    ", width=302 ]    the qubit - resonator system is described by the usual jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the resonator and the qubit frequencies , respectively , and @xmath23 is the qubit - resonator coupling , assumed to be real for simplicity of notations . here",
    "@xmath24 are the qubit raising and lowering operators , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the resonator field .",
    "let us use the rotating frame , which rotates with frequency @xmath21 for both the resonator and qubit .",
    "formally , this is introduced by using the interaction picture , based on separating the hamiltonian into two parts , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the free hamiltonian , and @xmath32 is the remaining interaction part .",
    "note however that in the interaction picture the hamiltonian does not depend on time , @xmath33 , because @xmath32 commutes with @xmath34 . even though the resonator and qubit operators now formally depend on time , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37",
    ", they always come in pairs , so that the time dependence is canceled out .",
    "this is why we can still use the time - independent operators @xmath26 , @xmath38 , and @xmath24 , which simplifies calculations .",
    "this trick is possible because the jc hamiltonian ( [ ham - jc ] ) is only the rotating - wave approximation of the actual physical hamiltonian .",

    "note that as discussed above , all operators here ( except the density matrix @xmath40 ) do not depend on time , even though we are using the interaction picture .",
    "also note that in this master equation we assumed that coupling between the resonator and the bath ( transmission line ) is frequency - independent ; this assumption is no longer valid in the case of the purcell filter @xcite , when @xmath16 becomes frequency - dependent .",
    "since we are only interested in quantifying the qubit relaxation through the resonator , we do not take into account the intrinsic qubit relaxation and pure dephasing . using eq .",
    ", one easily obtains the equations for the density matrix elements in the single - excitation subspace ( in the bare - state basis of @xmath11 and @xmath41 ) , which are decoupled from the elements containing state @xmath14 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 . here",
    "the bare - state populations @xmath44 and @xmath45 are coupled to the coherences @xmath46 via terms proportional to @xmath15 , while the damping term proportional to @xmath16 contributes to the decay of @xmath45 , but does not affect @xmath44 .",
    "note that the coherences @xmath47 decay with the rate @xmath48 .",
    "the population of the state @xmath14 obviously increases as @xmath49 .",
    "equation ( [ m ] ) can be used in numerical as well as in analytical calculations .",
    "in particular , the eigenvalues of the evolution can be found analytically from the corresponding quartic equation , which in this case has a relatively simple solution . below",
    "we will obtain these eigenvalues in a different way .    instead of using the density matrix language for the description of the purcell effect , it is also possible to use the simpler language of wavefunctions , even in the presence of the decay @xmath16 .",
    "physically , this is because in the single - excitation subspace unraveling of the lindblad equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) corresponds to only one scenario with no relaxation , and therefore the wavefunction evolution is non - stochastic .",
    "more formally , we can rewrite the master equation as @xcite @xmath50+\\kappa a\\rho a^{\\dag}$ ] , where @xmath51 is an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian .",

    "these are the usual equations for a two - level system , but with complex energy @xmath56 of the bare state @xmath41 . using the standard diagonalization procedure , we can find two eigenstates with energies @xmath57 , which can be written as @xmath58 with @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the complex energy of the eigenstate ( _ `` dressed '' state , which includes decay _ ) , corresponding to the excited qubit , while @xmath61 corresponds to the dressed resonator photon ( notice the sign of @xmath62 in the formula for @xmath63 ) . since @xmath64 , the population of the qubit dressed state decays with the rate @xmath65 .",
    "therefore @xmath65 is the qubit relaxation rate , i.e. , the purcell rate , while the photon relaxation rate is @xmath66 .",
    "if the initial state is not one of these eigenstates , then the evolution also includes oscillations with beating frequency @xmath63 , decaying with the rate @xmath67 .",
    "we have checked that the same rates can be obtained by diagonalizing the evolution matrix in eq .  , which has four eigenvalues : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , as expected from eq.([tilde - e ] ) .",
    "note that for small @xmath16 the frequency @xmath71 , but large @xmath16 may change it significantly .",
    "the eigenstates ( dressed states with decay ) @xmath72 and @xmath73 corresponding to the energies @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be found in the standard way , via the ratio @xmath74 and the normalization condition .",
    "however , note that these eigenstates are not mutually orthogonal , so finding the expansion of an initial state in the eigenbasis , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the vector orthogonal to @xmath77 ( similarly for @xmath78 ) .",
    "the evolution in the single - excitation subspace is then @xmath79 , and it is easy to find the density matrix elements ; for example the bare - state qubit occupation is @xmath80 .",
    "now let us consider several special cases starting with the case usually discussed for optical systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which the resonator damping rate is much larger than the coupling : @xmath81 , while @xmath62 is arbitrary .",

    "the main result is that the purcell rate @xmath157 is suppressed due to the presence of photons in the resonator , with the strong suppression obtained in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the presence of photons in the resonator also leads to qubit excitation , but the excitation rate @xmath145 is always much smaller than the no - drive purcell relaxation rate @xmath187 . we have derived approximate analytical formulas for the relaxation and excitation rates [ e.g. , eqs .",

    "( [ al ] ) .    to experimentally observe the purcell rate suppression with increasing microwave drive predicted in this work , it is important to make sure that other mechanisms do not increase the qubit relaxation rate faster than the obtained suppression .",
    "one such mechanism for superconducting qubits is the dressed dephasing @xcite , which increases the relaxation rate as @xmath358 , where @xmath359 is the pure dephasing rate ( this formula assumes a similar noise spectrum at the qubit frequency @xmath22 and at low frequency ) .",

    "we have also found that the suppression can still be crudely ( not quantitatively ) described as being due to the ac stark shift of the qubit frequency .    in the slightly nonlinear regime",
    "the repulsion of the level @xmath132 from the level @xmath368 ( which is added to the repulsion between the levels @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) leads to the effective detuning @xmath369 , where @xmath370 is the approximate coupling constant for the transitions between @xmath261 and @xmath364 .",
