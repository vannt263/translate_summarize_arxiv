    "galaxy - scale outflows of gas , sometimes called ` superwinds , ' have been known for some time to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in galaxies undergoing intense and spatially concentrated star formation ( i.e. , starburst galaxies ) . in these galaxies ,",
    "the driving force of large - scale winds is supernova - heated gas @xcite .",
    "these winds are active contributors to the evolution of galaxies and the surrounding inter - galactic or intra - cluster medium ( igm / icm ) in which they are embedded .",
    "winds have been invoked to resolve a number of issues in cosmology and galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( for a recent review of the properties and implications of mechanical feedback in galaxies , see @xcite . )",
    "to complement and extend the current state of knowledge of superwinds , we have undertaken the largest survey to date of outflows in infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "our survey extends over a broad redshift range from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "we have included starburst galaxies with a wide range of properties and , for the first time , searched for superwinds in a statistically significant number ( 43 ) of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "ulirgs are defined as galaxies with l_@xmath3  @xmath4  l_@xmath5 .",
    "our pilot study of 11 ulirgs @xcite and a more recent study of 20 ulirgs @xcite showed that winds occur with high frequency in these galaxies .",
    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies have unique properties @xcite .",

    "ulirgs possess quasar - like bolometric luminosities , and are the most numerous high - luminosity objects at low redshifts .",
    "the frequency of occurrence of agn activity in these galaxies increases with increasing infrared luminosity @xcite and as the merger progresses @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is hypothesized that ulirgs play a role in the evolution of quasars .",
    "many ulirgs may contain buried agn that are hidden by dust ; when this dust is removed ( by radiation pressure , or perhaps the outflows studied in this work ) , a bright quasar is left @xcite .",
    "this evolutionary process is currently under scrutiny , and is probably active in some , but not all , cases @xcite .",
    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath7 ) host less intense starbursts than ulirgs .",
    "they fall into two groups @xcite . half are early in the merger sequence of two roughly equal - mass galaxies , and are thus the progenitors of ulirgs @xcite .",
    "other lirgs are less - massive mergers or isolated disk galaxies which may or may not be experiencing an interaction @xcite . in our work , we combine lirgs and some less - luminous galaxies ( l_@xmath3/l_@xmath5  @xmath8 ) into a single group , which we label irgs ( for infrared galaxies ) .",
    "the ulirgs and irgs we have selected probe the medium - to - high star formation rate end of the starburst phenomenon . coupled with studies of outflows in dwarf starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can learn about the starburst phenomenon over a wide range of galaxy properties .",
    "furthermore , these infrared - luminous galaxies are important sites of obscured star formation at redshifts above unity , as seen in sub - mm galaxy counts ( see references above ) .",
    "early results from _ sst _ indicate that ulirgs may contain half of the forming stars at @xmath9 @xcite . by studying outflows in these galaxies at low redshift , we can learn how they have impacted galaxy evolution and the igm in previous epochs .",

    "we observed these galaxies in the  d  doublet absorption feature ( @xmath11 ) at moderately high spectral resolution ( @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "because of the low ionization potential of ground - state na ( 5.14  ev ) , this doublet feature probes neutral gas .",
    "it is not redshifted out of the visible until @xmath14 , making it a useful indicator over a wide range of cosmic times . furthermore",
    ", in the young starbursts that are found in most of our objects , na atoms are ionized in hot stars and the stellar  d  line is relatively weak ; the interstellar  abundance remains high , however .",
    "finally , its doublet nature resolves a degeneracy in optical depth and covering fraction . blueshifted velocity components in this feature",

    "we have taken special care with the  d  profile fitting in this work and discuss our methods in detail .",
    "this care is motivated by ( a ) the fact that simple gaussian fitting is not appropriate for mildly saturated features , which we observe in many cases ; ( b ) the need to decompose the broad , blended doublet lines we observe in many spectra ; and ( c ) the need to deal with non - zero covering fraction in most spectra .",
    "these issues have been partially addressed in the past but it is useful to discuss them here in the light of the advent of high - resolution spectrographs for deep galaxy surveys .    this paper describes the sample selection , observations , and data reduction for our survey , in   [ sample]@xmath15[obsred ] .",

    "the latter two are excluded from the 1  jy sample due to their low galactic latitude , while the first is excluded because its luminosity is slightly lower using older fluxes .",

    "we selected the brightest galaxies which have or liner optical spectral classifications based on low - dispersion spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "six of the galaxies in this subsample were observed in the mid - infrared with _ iso _ and are classified as starbursts ; one other ( f17068@xmath314027 ) has an agn classification @xcite .",

    ". this technique yields distant infrared - luminous galaxies because of the tight radio / far - infrared flux relationship for galaxies @xcite .",
    "the resulting sample consists of 108 sources with @xmath34 .",
    "we selected targets from the first / fsc catalog that have appropriate l_@xmath3  and @xmath32 , are not highly nucleated and do not have high very high radio fluxes ( to avoid selecting seyfert  1 galaxies ) , and have the brightest @xmath35band fluxes ( for observability ) .    since in most cases",
    "the 12 and 25  fluxes of these galaxies are too faint to be measured by _ iras _ , l_@xmath3  can not be calculated using the usual formula ( though the contribution of the 12 and 25  fluxes to l_@xmath3  is small ; @xcite ) . for many of these sources , infrared luminosities",

    "we used the kpc-18c grating in 1st order , which is a compromise between high resolution and good wavelength coverage , and the t2 kb detector .",
    "the slit width was @xmath58 , yielding an average spectral resolution at 6300    of @xmath59 , or 85  km  s@xmath13 , with a variation of @xmath60  km  s@xmath13  around this value .",
    "we observed @xmath61    in one exposure , allowing us to measure  d  and the h@xmath21/ [ ]  complex at once .",
    "the slit position angles listed in table [ objprop ] were generally chosen to be randomly oriented with respect to the galaxy , either at @xmath62 or near the parallactic angle . for most double - nucleus galaxies , however , we deliberately positioned the slit to connect the two nuclei in a single observation .",
    "standard data processing techniques were used to reduce our data . for the long - slit and mmt data , we used iraf routines for the basic reductions . for the esi data ,",
    "we used makee , which is a publicly - available data reduction pipeline . in each case , poisson error spectra were propagated in parallel with the data , since these errors are necessary for profile fitting (  [ fitting ] ) .",
    "our output wavelengths are vacuum heliocentric .",
    "the long slit data were not flatfielded , in order to retain the statistical weights of the raw data .",
    "however , fringing is not a problem for these data .",
    "the mmt and esi data were flatfielded to remove fringing and other defects , which are severe in the reddest orders .",
    "the spectral extraction of the echellette data was performed using ` optimal ' extraction techniques @xcite .",
    "this extraction takes care of defects and cosmic rays ; for the long slit data , we removed cosmic rays by hand in the regions of interest .",
    "henear lamps were used to wavelength - calibrate the long slit and mmt data ; cuar , hgne , and xe lamps were used simultaneously for the esi data .",
    "a number of standard stars were used for flux calibration ; the most effective ones are those with smooth continua free of metal absorption lines , such as g191-b2b and feige 34 ( which are both hot dwarfs ) .",
    "because the esi data is finely sampled and of moderately high resolution , the flux standards we chose have closely - spaced wavelength points , and any absorption features were carefully avoided .",
    "we generally extracted as much of the galaxy continuum light as possible . in some cases",
    "faint continuum or emission - line spatial extensions are present in the spectra , especially in the nearest galaxies , but we did not extract these regions if it seriously harmed the signal - to - noise of the extracted spectra .",
    "the result is that the linear size probed in each galaxy is different ( though not dramatically so ) , depending on the light distribution and redshift of the galaxy .",
    "it would have been desirable to extract a constant linear aperture for each galaxy , both for determining the properties of potential outflows and for computing nuclear spectral types of galaxies . practically , this was not possible due to the large redshift range in our sample .    before fitting the  d  feature , we divided the continuum by a legendre polynomial fit ( of order @xmath63 ) using 100    of data on either side of the @xmath64 @xmath15  d  complex .",
    "each galaxy is classified as an galaxy or a liner .",
    "for those objects for which nuclear optical spectral types are not available from previous data ( mostly galaxies from our high-@xmath32 subsample ) , we determined them using the line ratio diagrams of @xcite . there are four galaxies for which the spectral type is ambiguous because either h@xmath21 or [ ] @xmath65  are unobserved or absorbed by resonance lines in the atmosphere , but there is sufficient evidence in each case to effectively rule out a dominant agn ( see appendix [ app ] ) .",
    "the primary uncertainty in our spectral type measurements is increasing aperture size with redshift .",
    "the aperture is rectangular , with one side being the slit width ( @xmath4210 ) and the other the extraction size along the slit . a @xmath56 slit width projects to 5  kpc at @xmath66 .",
    "the extraction region along the slit is even larger .",
    "thus , starburst light from the host galaxy ( of spectral type ) could dilute the light from an agn ( of spectral type seyfert ) , especially weak broad - line regions .",
    "for this reason , the spectral types in our high-@xmath32 subsample should be considered somewhat uncertain .      for each galaxy ,",
    "we take the redshift from the following sources , in order of preference : ( 1 ) nebular emission - line rotation curves ( our data ) ; ( 2 ) emission or absorption lines @xcite ; ( 3 ) stellar absorption line centroids ( our data ) ; or ( 4 ) nebular emission line centroids ( our data ) .",
    "data is available for @xmath4220 of the nearest galaxies in our sample . in those cases where they agree ,",
    "we use the velocity instead of the rotation curve centroid , since the former is more precise .",
    "stellar absorption lines are preferable to nebular emission lines for finding the systemic velocity of the galaxy . however , in many cases we do not observe these lines or their s / n is too low , and we must resort to using emission lines . in both cases we average over as many strong lines as possible .    in many galaxies ( mostly irgs ) ,",
    "the optical emission lines indicate rotation . for these galaxies ,",
    "the redshift is the average of the velocities of the emission - line lobes of the rotation curve .",
    "other emission - line profiles show a single lobe , in which the sizes of the core and wings of the profiles vary greatly .",
    "the ulirgs tend to show complex and broad profiles . in asymmetric profiles where there is no obvious rotation and",
    "the profile is too irregular to fit with an analytic function , we have generally used the redshift of the peak of the line . to de - blend",
    "adjacent emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath21/ [ ] or [ ] @xmath67 ) , we fit analytic profiles to the lines , which generally yields a flux - averaged redshift .    the uncertainties in our redshift determinations ( both measurement and systemic ) are @xmath68 on average , or @xmath69  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the 1@xmath47 measurement uncertainties in the outflow velocity of the neutral gas are comparable ( @xmath4210  km  s@xmath13  on average ; see table [ compprop ] ) .",
    "wavelength calibration uncertainties are generally smaller , but comparable , at @xmath7010  km  s@xmath13",
    ". however , the systematic uncertainties in these quantities are unknown .",
    "figures @xmath71 display the spectra and line fits for our three subsamples .",
    "the data are binned in @xmath4235  km  s@xmath13  bins for the echellette data and slightly larger bins ( @xmath72  km  s@xmath13 ) for the kpno data , in each case using variance weighting .",
    "the horizontal axes show the velocity relative to systemic of the  d@xmath73 @xmath74 line .",
    "these spectra are analyzed and discussed in detail in paper ii .",
    "absorption line profiles can be classified in a number of ways that affect the choice of analysis technique :    * * instrumental resolution . * is the line resolved or unresolved by the spectrograph ? * * number of transitions .",
    "* how many transitions of a given atomic or molecular state are available ? if there are multiple transitions , are they blended or unblended ? * * optical depth and covering fraction .",
    "* is the line optically thin or optically thick ? is the covering fraction of the absorbing gas less than unity ? * * velocity distribution .",
    "* can the velocity distribution be described by a simple function like a gaussian ( i.e. , the ` curve - of - growth ' assumption ) ? can it be described by overlapping components of a simple function ?    in this section , we will first briefly review the effect of a covering fraction that is not unity on absorption line fitting .",
    "our particular focus , however , will be the impact of blending of two or more lines of a multiplet on fitting .",
    "our data is typically well - resolved , but the lines of the  d  doublet are blended because of the intrinsic broadening of the absorbing gas .",
    "the issue of blending is neglected in the literature .      for a single line ,",
    "the distribution of optical depth along the line - of - sight can be computed exactly as a function of velocity if the covering fraction of the gas is unity ( in other words , if the absorbing gas completely covers the background source ) .",
    "this is generally the case for quasar or stellar sight lines through the intergalactic and interstellar media , respectively , since the background light source in each of these cases is a point source .",
    "this analysis can also be done for blended doublet , triplet , or multiplet lines by solving a set of linear equations , gaussian fitting , or ` regularization ' methods @xcite .    in the case where the background light source subtends a large angle on the sky relative to the absorbing gas ,",
    "the covering fraction is not in general unity .",
    "examples include a galaxy starburst that illuminates gas clouds in the halo of the galaxy , or clouds in the broad - line region near a quasar . in these cases ,",
    "a degeneracy arises when solving for optical depth and covering fraction for a single line .",
    "this degeneracy is typically broken by observing two or more transitions in the same ion , with the same lower level , whose relative optical depths can be computed exactly from atomic physics .",
    "multiple transitions are necessary for constraining the optical depth of a line when the covering fraction is less than unity . whether or not these lines are blended or not depends on their separation and on the astrophysical context ( are the lines intrinsically broad or narrow ? ) .",
    "an example of resolved , unblended lines are the broad , interstellar h &  k lines seen in mrk 231 @xcite ; these lines have widths of several hundred km  s@xmath13 , but the h &  k lines are separated by several thousand km  s@xmath13 . in the same galaxy , we observe  d  lines with widths of @xmath751000  km  s@xmath13 ; the two lines of the doublet are , however , separated by only 300  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the  d  lines in this galaxy are thus resolved and blended .    for the case of multiple resolved , unblended lines in the same ion that arise from the same energy level",
    ", it is trivial to calculate both optical depth and covering fraction as a function of velocity",
    ". no velocity distribution must be assumed .",
    "the intensity in a line is a unique function of optical depth and covering fraction at each velocity .",
    "the optical depths of the different lines in a multiplet are related by atomic physics , and their covering fractions are the same , such that one can solve a set of simple equations to get @xmath76 and c_f@xmath77  as a function of velocity .",
    "the only caveat is that the optical depth ratio of at least two of the lines in the multiplet should be substantially different from unity .",
    "these techniques are discussed in a number of papers on intrinsic quasar absorption lines in the uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the optical depths and covering fractions determined this way are still subject to uncertainties , since they are averages along the line - of - sight and across the continuum source .",
    "furthermore , the covering fraction determined in this way also includes light scattered into the line of sight .",
    "( other subtleties of interpretation exist , but are beyond the scope of this discussion . )",
    "the classic alternative to this for two unresolved ( but still unblended lines ) is the doublet ratio method @xcite .",

    "the doublet ratio method uses the ratio of the equivalent widths of the two lines of a doublet , @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath41 is independent of covering fraction as long as c_f@xmath77  is independent of velocity , since c_f@xmath77  appears under the integral for @xmath86 in equation ( [ weq ] ) . assuming a constant c_f@xmath77  and a maxwellian velocity distribution , the equivalent width ratio @xmath41 is a monotonic function of the central optical depth of either line ( see equation [ 2 - 39 ] and table 2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "we can thus determine the central optical depth from the measured equivalent widths and compute the total gas column density ( from equations [ 2 - 40 ] or [ 2 - 41 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "with knowledge of the optical depth , the covering fraction then follows from the residual intensity of the doublet lines .",
    "if the actual velocity distribution is not maxwellian , the doublet ratio method can underestimate the true optical depth .",
    "@xcite explore the case of a 2-component profile ( i.e. , two overlapping gaussian profiles in a single transition ) .",
    "they show that narrow , saturated components can carry a small fraction of the actual line - of - sight mass but dominate the equivalent width of the line and cause an underestimate of @xmath76 .",
    "there are generic cases in which a superposition of components can accurately mimic the behavior of a maxwellian , however @xcite . a few superposed components do not , as discussed above .",
    "but a combination of many components , even if a few are mildly saturated ( with optical depths @xmath87 ) , can produce good results under the doublet ratio method ( i.e. , the ratio of computed to actual column densities @xmath88 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this result holds whether or not the components actually overlap in velocity space .",
    "however , it does assume that the individual components are approximately maxwellian and that the distributions of their parameters ( doppler parameter @xmath83 and optical depth @xmath76 ) are not too strange @xcite .",
    "the case where lines in a doublet or other multiplet are blended together applies to our data , and is thus of particular interest . in the following discussion ,",
    "we limit ourselves to a doublet , for simplicity and because it is relevant to this work .",
    "we can not simply integrate the spectrum to get the equivalent widths of the doublet lines , since they are blended . nor can we solve for @xmath76 and c_f@xmath77  directly , since in the region of overlap the solution is not unique .",
    "we must thus fit analytic profiles to the lines .",
    "one method of solution is to fit simple functional forms ( such as gaussian or voigt profiles ) to the intensity as a function of wavelength , measure the resulting equivalent widths , and use the doublet ratio to determine the optical depth of the line .",
    "recall that the doublet ratio method assumes a maxwellian velocity distribution and a covering fraction that is independent of velocity .",
    "a maxwellian velocity distribution ( equivalent to a gaussian in optical depth ) only translates into a gaussian in intensity in the case of optically thin gas .",
    "if fitting gaussian intensity profiles leads to a high optical depth ( @xmath89 ) in either line , one of the assumptions of the doublet ratio method is incorrect .",
    "one result of this failure of the method is that different formulas ( e.g. , equations [ 2 - 40 ] and [ 2 - 41 ] in @xcite ) give different values for the column density",
    "!    the doublet ratio method can give approximately correct results if there is a superposition of many components @xcite . as we discuss above , this is true even if the intensity profile is gaussian and some of the components are mildly saturated ( @xmath90 )",
    ". the profile shape may also be governed by the covering fraction rather than the optical depth , in which case optically thick gas could produce a gaussian in intensity . since in this case",
    "the covering fraction is not constant , the assumptions of the doublet ratio method do not apply ; this method instead overestimates the true optical depth , as we show in figure [ rvtau ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a second method of solution is to allow more complex intensity profiles , which are direct functions of physical parameters ( e.g. , velocity , optical depth , and covering fraction ) .",
    "the obvious benefit of this is that the profile shape is readily understood in terms of these physical parameters and the chosen optical depth and covering fraction distributions .",
    "furthermore , different assumptions about these distributions can be tried .",
    "this method is preferable to the first in the case of a maxwellian velocity distribution and constant c_f@xmath77 , since it accurately treats the intensity profile at both low and high optical depth .",
    "it has the same drawback of the first method of requiring _ some _ assumption about the form of these , but it is at least explicit about these assumptions .    the  d  lines are generally blended together in our data into a single feature , and some have a covering fraction less than unity .",
    "we choose to use the second method of analysis described above . for simplicity , we assume a maxwellian velocity distribution . in the current analysis we have restricted ourselves to a constant covering fraction , for simplicity . however , exploring non - constant @xmath77 using analytic profiles would be interesting and useful .      decomposing blended profiles correctly also requires assumptions about the geometry of the absorbing gas .",
    "the relationship between the intensity profile and the physical parameters depends not only on the optical depth and covering fraction distributions , but also on the geometry .",

    "we show schematics of these absorber geometries in figure [ geomfig ] .",
    "note that at a given wavelength , the atoms producing the d@xmath91 line are separated by 6    ( @xmath42300  km  s@xmath13 ) from the atoms producing the d@xmath73 line .",

    "* suppose that the atoms at all velocities are located at the same position in the plane of the sky relative to the background continuum source .",

    "the covering fraction in this case is independent of velocity .",
    "the correct expression for the combined intensity of two separate velocity components ( each with optical depth @xmath92 and covering fraction @xmath93 ) is then given by @xmath94 2 .",

    "in this case , the total covering fraction at any wavelength is subject to the constraint @xmath97 3 .",
    "* partially overlapping atoms . *",
    "a ` middle - ground ' assumption is that there is overlap at a given wavelength between the atoms producing the components , and that the covering fraction describes the fractional coverage of both the continuum source and also of the atoms producing the other component .",

    "it contains the expression for our second case plus a cross term involving the product @xmath99 . in this case , the total covering fraction of the continuum source at a given wavelength is @xmath100    in our analysis , we use a mixture of the above cases . to combine the intensities of the two doublet lines within a given velocity component",
    ", we assume the case of complete overlap and use equation ( [ case1 ] ) .",
    "in reality there may be spatial variation within a given component , especially when we consider that at a given wavelength the velocity separation between the doublet lines is 300  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "however , we use the simplest assumption here .    to combine two different velocity components , we assume partial overlap and use equation ( [ case3 ] ) .",
    "case 1 is unlikely , since different components should have different covering fractions if we assume they are spatially distinct .",
    "case 2 is possible , but we still consider case 3 the most likely .",

    "the formulas necessary to compute @xmath86 (  d ) are discussed in  [ physics ] , and the equations for @xmath101 ( ) and @xmath101(h ) are found in  [ coldens ] .      to fit each  d  feature",
    ", we use a levenberg - marquardt ( l - m ) fitting routine from numerical recipes @xcite , modified to include bound constraints .",
    "these constraints are generally obvious and straightforward ( e.g. , @xmath102 ) , and are most important in bounding the optical depth , as we discuss below .",
    "our code , lmfit , is written in the c programming language .    because the l - m algorithm is a local optimizer , the number of components we choose and the initial parameter values are of some importance .",
    "we generally fit @xmath103 velocity components , as this seems to be the maximum number that is well - constrained by our data . adding more components has a tendency to create components with either very high or very low optical depths .",
    "we determine by eye the initial parameter values for input to the fitting routine .",
    "the final solution ( i.e. , set of parameters ) is in general not strongly sensitive to these initial guesses .",
    "however , in the instances that it is , the tendency is for the solution to approach high optical depths ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this shows up either as the parameter moving to the boundary of acceptable parameters or as long tails in the simulated optical depth distributions (  [ parerr ] ) in cases where the best - fit optical depth is only a few . for most of these cases we set the optical depth as a lower limit to the true value",
    "the most important boundary constraint is thus the optical depth upper limit , which we generally set to be @xmath425 ( as the fitting is insensitive to changes in optical depth above this value because of the minimal change in the profile shape ) .",
    "fortunately , the number of components with lower limits on @xmath76 is small ( only 13%  of components ) .",
    "these components are marked in table [ compprop ] .",
    "to fit the @xmath64 line ( 15    blueward of  d ) , we use @xmath105 gaussian components . if the profile is not a single gaussian , we model it on the basis of other emission lines .",
    "we usually constrain its wavelength or the wavelengths of its components to match those of other emission lines .    ideally , lmfit should convolve the expected profile shape with the instrumental resolution , prior to the actual fitting .",
    "this convolution adds computation time , which becomes important when simulating parameter errors .",
    "furthermore , the instrumental response function for our data is not always gaussian , especially for the data with slit widths comparable to or larger than the intrinsic spectral resolution ( e.g. , our high - resolution keck data ) . for these set - ups ,",
    "the intrinsic profile tends to be flat - topped . accurately measuring this profile should be possible with a sufficient number of sky lines .",
    "numerical simulations show that instrumental smearing has no significant impact on our data , however , and we ignore it .",
    "the interactive fitting package specfit is commonly used in optical spectroscopy , since it is bundled with iraf and has a range of analytic functions that can be fit to the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "specfit includes an l - m optimizer , along with several other minimization options . in @xcite , we used specfit and added an analytic function for an absorbing doublet with a gaussian in optical depth and a partial ( but constant ) covering fraction .",
    "we compared our finished code , lmfit , to the specfit l - m optimizer , since the latter is a frequently used and already tested code .",
    "we find that lmfit converges much more quickly , but the resulting parameters are similar to those obtained with specfit . however , on close inspection we discovered some minor problems with specfit , primarily in how it treats parameter boundaries .",
    "( 1 ) if the solution is across a parameter boundary after a predetermined number of iterations , specfit automatically fixes the value of this parameter at the boundary and stops varying it .",
    "this can artificially constrain the parameter before the minimum is reached .",
    "( 2 ) the l - m algorithm enforces the parameter limits after each iteration ( which in parameter phase space corresponds to moving the solution back to the boundary in one dimension ) at the wrong time , such that the computed @xmath106 applies to the position across the boundary , not the corrected position . ( 3 ) the l - m algorithm in specfit makes a stepwise numerical approximation to the first derivative using central differences ; while some approximation to the second derivative matrix should be made to avoid singularities , the exact first derivative is easy to compute from the model function and not computationally expensive .        to determine errors in the fitted parameters , we used monte carlo simulations . to do this",
    ", we first assumed the fitted parameters represent the ` real ' parameter values .",
    "we then added random poisson noise to a ` real ' spectrum , where the magnitude of the errors was estimated from the data .",
    "we repeated this 1000 times , each time fitting the resulting spectrum .",
    "this yielded a distribution of fitted parameters for each galaxy .",
    "the distributions in wavelength , @xmath107 , and doppler parameter , @xmath83 , are generally gaussian , which is consistent with the assumptions of finding a best fit by minimizing @xmath106 .",
    "fits to these gaussians yield 1@xmath47 errors in each parameter .",
    "this method was chosen as an alternative to estimating errors directly from the covariance matrix that is output by the fitting algorithm or from two - dimensional @xmath106 contours .",
    "given the large number of parameters involved , some of which are not completely independent of each other , it would be uninformative to simply quote these errors .",
    "the covariance matrix output from our fitting routine shows that in general the covering fraction and optical depth are anti - correlated within a given velocity component .",
    "because of this , we examined the distribution of the product @xmath108 , rather than of c_f@xmath77  or @xmath76 separately . in the case of high s / n data , @xmath109 is typically distributed as a gaussian . however , for most components , this product has a tail to high values , of varying length . instead of fitting a gaussian to the distribution in @xmath109 , we compute @xmath110-confidence errors both above and below the mean .",
    "when propagating these errors to other quantities , we typically assume that the percent error is split evenly between c_f@xmath77  and @xmath76 . however , if @xmath76 is a lower limit , we set the upper error in c_f@xmath77  to equal the lower error .",
    "there are a number of weak stellar absorption lines surrounding  d  ( see , e.g. , the high - resolution solar spectrum of * ? ? ?",
    "these nearby stellar features introduce errors in continuum normalization and identification of blueshifted features .    for illustration",
    ", we compare the high - resolution population synthesis models of @xcite to our observations of two galaxies ( figure [ popsynspec ] ) .",

    "we have combined a 40  myr old single stellar population ( instantaneous burst ) model with a 10  gyr old model , to represent the starburst and the old underlying population , respectively ( 40  myr reflects the gas consumption time in infrared - luminous galaxies ) .",
    "the two models have solar metallicity and young / old stellar mass fractions of 10/90 and 1/99 . in the 1/99 model , the luminosities of the two populations are comparable , and the old population dominates the equivalent width of  d  ( which is strongest in old , cool stars ) . in the 10/90 model , the young population dominates the luminosity of the galaxy and the  d  feature is weaker .",
    "we boxcar smooth our data to @xmath42150  km  s@xmath13 , and convolve the models with a @xmath111 km  s@xmath13  gaussian ( similar to the measured circular velocity of ulirgs ; k. dasyra , private communication ) .",
    "the models are normalized to unity at 5910    ( just redward of  d ) , and we add a linear normalization of @xmath112  @xmath13 to match the data .",
    "the strongest nearby stellar feature is located 33    ( 1700  km  s@xmath13 ) blueward of the d@xmath73 line and is centered at 5857.5   .",
    "there is variation in its strength among our spectra , and in general it is only noticeable after smoothing and too far to the blue to mimic anything but very high velocity outflowing gas .",
    "for instance , in f10378@xmath311108 ( figure [ popsynspec]@xmath83 ) , this stellar feature blends slightly with the most blueshifted interstellar component , but the stellar contribution is small .",
    "a secondary stellar feature ( arising primarily from young stars ) is closer in wavelength to  d  but weaker , and an examination of our spectra shows that it has little or no impact on our results .",
    "though these weak , blueshifted stellar features are present in most galaxies , they are either too blueshifted or too weak to affect our fitting in cases where a wind is present .",
    "thus , we consider this source of error to be small .",
    "however , spectra with apparent high - velocity , blueshifted interstellar lines must still be carefully inspected to ensure that these lines are not stellar in origin .",
    "the best way to remove the effect of blueshifted stellar lines would be to fit stellar population synthesis models to our data and remove this component . however , our spectra are in general not of high enough signal - to - noise to do this reliably . to minimize errors in continuum fitting ,",
    "we have generally avoided the strongest stellar features blueward of  d.      in galaxy spectra ,  d  has contributions due to stellar absorption from late type stars and interstellar absorption from clouds of gas .",
    "figure [ popsynspec ] illustrates this . in one galaxy ( f15549@xmath314201 ) , the  d  absorption is purely stellar ( consistent with our fitting and the absence of an outflow ; see paper ii ) . in the other ( f10378@xmath311108 ) ,",
    "the absorption is mostly interstellar , but there is some stellar contribution . in a re - analysis of our data for this object , we are able to fit a weak , optically thick line at the position of the stellar absorption , plus three blueshifted interstellar components ( though we do not ultimately use this fit , as it is unconstrained ; see paper ii ) .",
    "we can estimate the expected stellar contribution to  d  by scaling the equivalent width of the  _ b _  triplet , @xmath1135167 , 5173 , 5185 @xcite .",

    "the spectrum of  d  in each galaxy is shown .",
    "the equations for computing  and h column densities from the data are presented .",
    "finally , we discuss at length our fitting procedures and the subtleties of measuring the absorption - line parameters . our absorption lines are blended doublets observed at moderately high resolution , a case that has not been addressed in the literature in detail .",
    "one important finding is that the doublet ratio method is invalid if , after fitting gaussian intensity profiles , the optical depth is found to be large , since this violates the assumptions of the method .",
    "a better method for resolved but blended data is to fit more complex intensity profiles that are functions of physical parameters ( velocity , optical depth , and covering fraction ) .    a detailed analysis of these data is presented in paper ii @xcite .",
