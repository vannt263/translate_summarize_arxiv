    "recently a great deal of work has been done in quantum optics on simulations of continuously measured systems with dissipation , referred to variously as quantum jumps , relative state , and monte carlo wavefunction simulations @xcite , which are examples of a class of techniques known as `` quantum trajectories . '' in these techniques , a deterministic master equation for the density matrix of an open system is replaced with a stochastic differential equation for a pure quantum state . averaging the solutions over all realizations of the noise reproduces the master equation .",
    "such a stochastic pure - state equation is known as an `` unraveling '' of the master equation .",
    "unraveling is not unique ; in general , there can be many stochastic equations which average to the same master equation .",
    "a single solution for one realization of the noise is called a `` quantum trajectory . ''    in the original conception , the system was assumed to be monitored by continuous measurements performed on the environment .",
    "the information from the measurements `` collapsed '' the system density matrix to a pure state , but the randomness of the measurement outcomes made this state unpredictable .",
    "the effective description of the continuously monitored system is thus a stochastic differential equation : an unraveling .",
    "different unravelings correspond to different measurement schemes .",
    "averaging over all possible measurement outcomes reproduces the master equation , which is the best prediction that could be made in the absence of any measurements .",
    "however , even with no knowledge of the environment and its interaction with the system , one can formally unravel any master equation into a stochastic differential equation for pure states . in this case , the unraveling is simply used as a means of solving the master equation .",
    "this provides a useful numerical technique , commonly called `` quantum monte carlo . '' by averaging over many solutions of the quantum trajectory one can find an approximate solution to the master equation . a density operator @xmath0 on a hilbert space of dimension @xmath1 requires @xmath2 real numbers to represent it ; this can be computationally prohibitive for large @xmath1 , while a single state ( of size @xmath3 ) remains practical , even with the necessity of averaging over many runs of the stochastic equation .    around the same time that quantum trajectories were introduced",
    ", the consistent ( or decoherent ) histories formulation of quantum mechanics was developed by griffiths , omns , and gell - mann and hartle @xcite . in this formalism , one describes a quantum system in terms of an exhaustive set of possible histories , which must satisfy a _ decoherence _ or",
    "_ consistency _ criterion .",
    "histories which satisfy this criterion do not interfere with each other , and may be assigned probabilities which obey the usual classical probability sum rules .",
    "both quantum trajectories and consistent histories describe a quantum system in terms of alternative possible evolutions ; they thus bear a certain resemblance to each other .",
    "what is more , sets of histories corresponding to possible records of a `` classical '' measuring device will always decohere .",
    "thus , there will be a set of consistent histories which correspond to the quantum trajectories of a continuously measured system .",
    "exactly such a correspondence has been shown between decoherent histories and quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) , a particular unraveling of the master equation , by disi , gisin , halliwell and percival @xcite .",
    "qsd trajectories were shown to correspond to a set of approximately consistent histories for a specific choice of projection operators at closely spaced intervals of time .",
    "earlier , disi @xcite had shown that a particular type of branch - dependent decoherent history first examined by paz and zurek @xcite corresponded to yet another type of trajectory , the orthogonal jump unraveling .",
    "below i will show a similar correspondence for quantum jumps , and i conjecture that most useful unravelings correspond to some set of decoherent histories in an analogous way .",
    "i also demonstrate an interesting correspondence between standard quantum jumps and the orthogonal jumps of disi .",
    "i have shown the correspondence with decoherent histories for a simple model in an earlier paper @xcite , and there has also been work by ting yu @xcite from a rather different perspective on the relationship of quantum jumps and decoherent histories . in this paper , i will analyze the correspondence between quantum trajectories and decoherent histories in general using the concept of it generalized records introduced by gell - mann and hartle @xcite , which provides a unifying framework for both .",
    "recent work on non - markovian quantum state diffusion explicitly includes the correlation between the trajectory and the state of the environment @xcite ; in that case , the environment state is precisely this kind of generalized record .    in section",
    "ii , i review the formalism of quantum trajectories , giving the quantum jump unraveling in some detail but also briefly describing the quantum state diffusion and ortho - jump unravelings .",
    "i then review the formalism of decoherent ( consistent ) histories , and contrast it with quantum trajectories .",
    "i point out that the usual quantum trajectory description itself assumes a certain consistency condition .    in section iii",
    ", i examine a simple model of a photon counting experiment , in which the photodetector is represented by a markovian environment producing rapid dissipation and decoherence in a field mode coupled to a quantum system .",
    "this representation reproduces the effects of repeated von neumann measurements , and in the limit of separated timescales between the system and environment allows one to derive a markovian master equation for the system alone .",
    "this master equation can be unraveled into quantum jump or ortho - jump trajectories as described in sections ia and ib above , and we will see that there is an equivalence between these unravelings for this model",
    ".    in section iv , i start with the same model of a photon counting experiment , but this time enumerate a set of consistent histories representing different photodetection records .",
    "we see that the probabilities of these histories are the same as the quantum jump trajectories in section iii , and that these histories do decohere to a high level of accuracy .    in section",
    "v , i show that the model detector of section iii produces generalized records , the existence of which guarantees that the consistency conditions will be met .",
    "the existence of generalized records allows the interpretation of quantum trajectories as consistent histories even in a case with no measurement devices ; i argue this in the case when the outgoing electromagnetic field from the system itself serves as a generalized record ( though one with many incompatible interpretations ) .",
    "finally , in section vi , the results are summarized , and we see that they both generalize the notion of quantum trajectories and provide a useful calculational tool for the formalism of decoherent histories .",
    "the systems of interest in quantum trajectories are described by a lindblad master equation in the markov approximation @xcite , @xmath4 + \\sum_m \\left ( \\lhat_m \\rho \\lhat_m^\\dagger    - { 1\\over2 } \\lhat_m^\\dagger \\lhat_m \\rho    - { 1\\over2 } \\rho \\lhat_m^\\dagger \\lhat_m \\right)\\ , \\label{master_eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the reduced density operator of the system , @xmath5 is the system hamiltonian , and the @xmath6 are a set of _ lindblad operators _ which model the effects of the environment .",
    "( note that throughout this paper i use units where @xmath7 . )",
    "one of the notable characteristics of master equations of the form ( [ master_eqn ] ) is that they do not , in general , preserve pure states .",
    "suppose that the system is initially in the state @xmath8 over time it will evolve into a mixture which can be written @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ensemble mean with probabilities @xmath11 the decomposition ( [ rho_expansion ] ) is generally not unique ; there can be many different sets of states @xmath12 which give the same density operator @xmath0 .",
    "this ambiguity leads to an ambiguity in unraveling the evolution , to which we will return shortly .",
    "now let us choose a set of states @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a random process and @xmath13 obeys a stochastic evolution equation . by averaging over all solutions of this stochastic equation for all realizations of the noise @xmath14",
    ", one finds the solution of ( [ rho_expansion ] ) at time @xmath15 .",
    "this stochastic equation will be of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a stochastic differential variable representing the random process @xmath14 , and can include continuous diffusive noise , discrete jumps , or both .",
    "the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of the state @xmath20 .",
    "( in general , there will be several noise terms with different @xmath17 . )",
    "a single solution @xmath13 of this equation for a single realization of @xmath14 follows a quantum trajectory in hilbert space .",
    "the complete set of solutions for all @xmath14 constitutes an unraveling of the master equation .",
    "this is a rather formal notion of quantum trajectories , since it is not clear what physical significance the states @xmath13 have , if any .",
    "given the existence of many different expansions ( [ rho_expansion ] ) for the same density operator @xmath21 , one must also admit the possibility of many different possible unravelings .",
    "if the choice of unraveling is not unique , what physical reality does it have ?",
    "fortunately , it is possible to use the abstract idea of unraveling in practical situations where @xmath13 _ does _ have a physical interpretation .",
    "indeed , this was the original motivation for developing quantum trajectories @xcite .",
    "the non - unitarity of the master equation is caused by the loss of information from the system to the environment , as their interaction produces entanglement between the system and environment degrees of freedom .",
    "within the master equation description this entanglement is inaccessible ; but if one has experimental access to the environment , it is possible to extract information about the system by making selected measurements . if the measurements are performed with sufficient precision and frequency , and the initial state is known , one can determine the exact state of the system at later times .",
    "if we include the environment in our description , the joint system - environment state remains pure : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are states in the system and environment hilbert spaces , respectively . for any state @xmath25",
    "it is possible to find an expression ( [ purification ] ) such that the @xmath23 are all mutually orthogonal , as are the @xmath24 ; this is the schmidt decomposition @xcite .",
    "however , in general this is not necessary ; any decomposition ( [ purification ] ) in which the @xmath24 ( but not necessarily the @xmath23 ) are orthogonal will suffice . in particular , given an observable for the environment , we can choose the @xmath24 to be a basis of eigenstates .",
    "then by measuring the environment , the system goes into the state @xmath23 with probability @xmath26 .    in this picture",
    "the system remains in a pure state , but its evolution is no longer deterministic : it is influenced by random measurement outcomes .",
    "this is often referred to as _ conditional _ ( or _ relative state _ )",
    "evolution : it is conditioned on the measurement record . if one averages over all possible measurement outcomes , a particular decomposition of the density operator ( [ rho_expansion ] ) results .",
    "this exactly matches the earlier notion of a quantum trajectory , but now the unraveling has a clear - cut physical interpretation : the state @xmath13 represents our knowledge of the system , conditioned on the random outcomes @xmath14 of a sequence of measurements , and @xmath27 is the probability of this outcome .    note",
    "that not all measurements will satisfy the requirement ( [ rho_expansion ] ) !",
    "indeed , only a fairly restricted subclass will do so .",
    "we discuss this restriction in iie below , and later in section v.      we can make this clearer with a concrete example .",
    "suppose we consider a quantum optical system , such as a small cavity with one mirror partially silvered so that radiation can escape .",
    "the external electromagnetic field represents the environment in this case , while a field mode inside the cavity is the system .",
    "we describe the system evolution by a master equation @xcite @xmath28 + \\gamma \\a \\rho \\adag    - ( \\gamma/2 ) \\adag \\a",
    "\\rho    - ( \\gamma/2 ) \\rho \\adag \\a , \\label{cavity}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 represents the hamiltonian of the system mode , @xmath30 is the annihilation operator , and @xmath31 represents the rate of dissipation from the cavity .",
    "we will be considering this simple master equation for most of this paper .",
    "equation ( [ cavity ] ) describes the evolution of the system _ provided _ that we know nothing about the quanta which escape to the environment , or choose to ignore that information .",
    "suppose we place photodetectors outside the cavity in such a way that every escaped photon is detected .",
    "each detection gives us some information about the state of the system . in this case , with perfect detection , the system evolution becomes @xmath32 interrupted at random times by sudden quantum jumps @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the _ effective hamiltonian _ @xmath35 and the jumps occur with a probability given by the norm of the state , as we shall see explicitly below @xcite . equation ( [ qj_schrod ] ) has the form of the usual schrdinger equation , but with a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "a state that evolves for a time @xmath15 without jumping is given by @xmath36    the jumps represent detections of emitted photons , which trigger a sudden change in our knowledge of the system .",
    "the presence of the non - hermitian terms in the effective hamiltonian represents the effect of _ not _ detecting any photons on our knowledge of the system ; a null measurement thus still affects the system .",
    "this evolution does not preserve the norm of the state .",
    "the actual physical state is taken to be @xmath37 , the renormalized state .",
    "an actual physical detector can not determine the time of a photon emission with infinite precision ; at best , it will determine the time within a short interval @xmath38 .",
    "the probability that an initial state @xmath20 evolves for a time @xmath39 and undergoes @xmath1 jumps at times @xmath40 ( which are assumed to be widely spaced with respect to @xmath38 ) is @xmath41 this trace is the norm of the state @xmath42 which is the unrenormalized state resulting from this particular sequence of jumps @xmath40 .",
    "the norm of the unrenormalized state thus gives the probability density for that state to be realized .",
    "the density operator @xmath0 is given by averaging over all realizations @xmath43 with probability measure ( [ jumps_prob ] ) , @xmath44 the density operator defined by ( [ mean ] ) solves the master equation ( [ cavity ] ) .",
    "it is possible to rewrite these equations in explicitly norm - preserving form , @xmath45 at the cost of a little extra complexity and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "this is a stochastic differential equation , where @xmath46 is a stochastic variable which is 0 except at random times ( corresponding to the jumps ) when it becomes 1 .",
    "it has statistics @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the ensemble average over all trajectories which are in state @xmath20 at the given time @xmath15 .",
    "the nonlinear form has useful properties , but for our purposes the linear form will usually prove more convenient .",
    "the quantum jump equation is not the only way of unraveling the master equation into quantum trajectories .",
    "in fact , there are an infinite number of such unravelings .",
    "certain choices are more commonly used than others , however , so we will go over them quickly .",
    "one of the most useful is the _ quantum state diffusion _ ( qsd ) equation @xcite @xmath49 this is an it stochastic differential equation @xcite , with the @xmath50 representing continuous complex stochastic processes with ensemble means @xmath51 it is not difficult to show that this equation also obeys the master equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) in the mean : @xmath52 rather than discrete jumps , the solutions of this equation undergo continuous diffusion .",
    "this standard form of the qsd equation is nonlinear and norm - preserving .",
    "however , there is a different unraveling known as _ linear qsd _ with equation @xmath53 this does _ not _ preserve the norm of @xmath20 , but is also a valid unraveling of the master equation , and has properties similar to the nonlinear equation @xcite .",
    "the qsd equation was discovered by gisin and percival , following from earlier work by gisin in the theory of measurement .",
    "carmichael @xcite showed that a similar diffusion equation arose in the case ( [ cavity ] ) from a relative state approach , just as in quantum jumps , but with direct photodetection replaced by balanced homodyne detection .",
    "it was shown by wiseman and milburn @xcite and others @xcite that the exact qsd equation arises in the case of balanced heterodyne detection .",
    "thus , one can consider both approaches as giving the state of a system conditioned on a measurement record , but using different measurement schemes .",
    "we will discuss this further below .",
    "( the linear equation ( [ linear_qsd ] ) does not have such a straightforward interpretation in terms of measurements , though that does not necessarily imply that such an interpretation might not be found . )",
    "conversely , gisin and percival have shown @xcite that jump - like behavior can be exhibited by the qsd equation by explicitly including a portion of the photodetector in addition to the system ; their explicit inclusion of part of the environment is similar to the approach of this paper .    related to qsd",
    "are the _ orthogonal jumps _ of disi @xcite .",
    "these trajectories obey an equation @xmath54 where the @xmath55 now represent a stochastic jump process , @xmath56 and the set of states @xmath57 are mutually orthogonal and orthogonal to @xmath20 .",
    "the formula for these orthogonal states and their jump rates @xmath58 is complicated ; fortunately , for the purposes of this paper we will not need to worry about it .",
    "the deterministic portion of equation ( [ ortho_jumps ] ) is identical to that of the qsd equation expressed in stratonovich rather than it form @xcite .",
    "these orthogonal jumps are in some ways the most economical unraveling of the master equation , in that these jumps occur fairly infrequently but cause a large change in the state .",
    "this unraveling also has close ties to decoherent histories , as we shall see .",
    "however , relatively little work has been done on the connection between ortho - jumps and measurements @xcite .",
    "an important result is that ortho - jumps result from choosing the schmidt decomposition of ( [ purification ] ) , where the @xmath23 as well as the @xmath24 are all orthogonal , and measuring the eigenbasis @xmath24 .",
    "this measurement gives the maximum average information about the system , but requires a dynamic measurement scheme , since the basis @xmath24 will in general be different at different times .",
    "this form of ortho - jumps is also explicitly norm - preserving , which results in a nonlinear stochastic equation , just as for qsd .",
    "unlike the other equations presented , there is no completely linear version of this unraveling ; the orthogonalization procedure used in determining the @xmath57 is intrinsically nonlinear .",
    "however , for certain special problems these @xmath57 are linear functions of @xmath20 . in this special case",
    "it is possible to find a linear version of ortho - jumps which does not preserve the norm , and which is closely related to the standard quantum jump equation .",
    "we will examine such a case below .",
    "all of these unravelings correspond to the same markovian master equation .",
    "if considered simply as a way of solving for the density operator , it does nt matter which unraveling one picks ; averaging over any set of trajectories will give the same final result .",
    "but if one actually has a physical description of the environment , and of the measurements being performed on it , this equivalence is broken , and a particular choice of unraveling is singled out .",
    "this is the case in this paper , where we assume a particular ( albeit simplified ) description of the environment , including the effects of a measurement apparatus , to model photodetection .",
    "let us now turn to consistent histories . in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics",
    "one can specify a set of possible histories by choosing a sequence of times @xmath59 and at each time @xmath60 a complete set of orthogonal projection operators @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 where the @xmath63 s are heisenberg operators .",
    "these projectors represent a complete set of exclusive alternatives at the given times .",
    "a single history corresponds to a choice of one projection operator @xmath64 at each time @xmath60 .",
    "this history can be represented by the sequence of indices @xmath65 , which i will denote by @xmath66 .",
    "this is not the most general type of history .",
    "for instance , one can make the set of projections at a later time depend on the choices @xmath67 at earlier times , making the histories _ branch - dependent_. we will not need this extra generality in this paper , but it can be useful in describing measurements which are conditioned on the results of earlier measurements .    the decoherence ( or consistency ) criterion is described by the _ decoherence functional _ @xmath68 $ ] , a complex functional on pairs of histories .",
    "two histories @xmath66 and @xmath69 are said to _ decohere _ if they satisfy the relation @xmath70 = p(h ) \\delta_{hh ' } , \\label{decoherence}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 defines to be the probability of history @xmath66 .",
    "a set of histories @xmath72 is said to be complete and consistent if all pairs of histories satisfy ( [ decoherence ] ) and their probabilities sum to unity .",
    "we define a _ history operator _",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74 in terms of this operator the decoherence functional becomes @xmath70 = \\tr \\ { \\c_h \\rho_0 \\c_{h'}\\d \\},\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the initial state .",
    "if @xmath75 is pure , @xmath76 , then @xmath68 $ ] is an inner product @xmath70 = \\bra\\psi\\c_{h'}\\d \\c_h\\ket\\psi , \\label{inner_product}\\ ] ] and the consistency condition ( [ decoherence ] ) amounts to the assertion that the states @xmath77 are orthogonal for different @xmath66 , with the probability of a history given by the norm of the corresponding state .",
    "it is often convenient to consider these projections in the schrdinger rather than the heisenberg picture . in this case , the @xmath63 s are no longer time - dependent , and instead the time - evolution is given explicitly : @xmath78 written in this form , it is clear that the state @xmath79 has a strong resemblance to our previous definition of a quantum trajectory .",
    "this succession of hamiltonian and projection terms resembles some kind of pure state evolution , and if no single history has probability 1 this evolution will have a stochastic component .    however , there are a number of important differences .",
    "the first is the most obvious : in our definition of quantum trajectories , there was no requirement that they should obey the decoherence criterion .",
    "this is related to the fact that the decomposition ( [ rho_expansion ] ) need not be in terms of orthogonal states .",
    "more on this below .",
    "the second difference is that quantum trajectories were framed in terms of a split between system and environment degrees of freedom , with the environment traced out of the equations of motion in the markovian approximation .",
    "these assumptions are not made in consistent histories , which can be quite general .",
    "the open systems case is important , however @xcite , and is worth treating in depth in consistent histories .",
    "most such treatments to date @xcite involve choosing a set of projection operators on the system alone , while making no assertions about the environment degrees of freedom .",
    "that is , one specializes to projections of the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a projection operator in the hilbert space of the system and @xmath82 is the identity operator in the hilbert space of the environment .",
    "the markovian approximation will only be valid for certain choices of environments and of the system / environment interaction , of course ; but if one is treating the same systems in both the quantum trajectories and decoherent histories approach , the approximation should be good in both cases .",
    "one ends up with a reduced description in terms of the system alone , quite in the spirit of the master equation .",
    "if we physically interpret the quantum trajectories as evolution conditioned on measurements of the environment , we realize that ( [ sys_projector ] ) is not adequate to describe this situation . to make statements about the state of the environment , we require projectors onto the environment , not just the system .",
    "in fact , the correct projectors in this case have the form @xmath83 quite different from the usual discussion of decoherence in open systems .",
    "thus , to look for a set of histories equivalent to a particular unraveling , we must retain in our description enough of the environment to include suitable projections of the form ( [ env_projector ] ) . as we shall see",
    ", in some cases this may be very little .",
    "to reduce to a description of the system alone , a further tracing out of the environment is then required .    as far as consistency is concerned",
    ", it has not been widely appreciated that quantum trajectories ( as they are commonly defined ) must obey a consistency condition of their own .",
    "this is easily seen by considering the effects of environmental measurements .",
    "rather than tracing out the environment to get a master equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) , we retain a complete description of the system and environment ( [ purification ] ) .",
    "there is a hamiltonian @xmath5 for the system and environment together , such that they tend to become entangled with time : @xmath84 suppose we now perform a series of @xmath85 measurements on the environment spaced @xmath86 apart in time , with outcomes corresponding to projections of the form ( [ env_projector ] ) .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) joint state conditioned on these outcomes then becomes @xmath87 with probability @xmath88 .",
    "we now want to impose the condition ( [ rho_expansion ] ) . in order for this to hold we must have @xmath89 which implies @xmath90 this equation is by no means automatically satisfied .",
    "it is , in fact , a consistency condition rather like ( [ decoherence ] ) . in some ways",
    "it is much weaker , since ( [ traj_consistency ] ) is only imposed on sums of off - diagonal terms rather than individual terms ( although it must be satisfied for all times @xmath15 ) . in another way it is stronger : the trace in ( [ traj_consistency ] ) is only over the environment , so that an entire operator on the system space is required to vanish , not just the trace .",
    "this is rather like the partial trace decoherence of finkelstein @xcite , discussed in section iv . in physical terms , ( [ traj_consistency ] ) means that the measurements made must not alter the state of the environment such that it then acts back and alters the dynamics of the system .",
    "as we shall see , quantum jumps ( like most of the commonly considered unravelings ) satisfies both ( [ traj_consistency ] ) and ( [ decoherence ] ) , and in fact satisfies a consistency criterion stronger than either .",
    "the born - markov approximation which is generally made in deriving the master equation explicitly assumes that the state of the environment is not changed by interacting with the system ; so long as measurements are made only on the outgoing field , ( [ traj_consistency ] ) will be satisfied .",
    "what makes a set of histories decohere ? while a general characterization is still the subject of research , common mechanisms of decoherence have been widely studied in simple models , and are now fairly well understood .",
    "suppose that the state of the system at the time @xmath60 becomes correlated with some degrees of freedom of the environment described by a hilbert subspace @xmath91 , and the projection operator @xmath92 singles out a particular state of @xmath91 .",
    "if the state of these degrees of freedom is subsequently unaltered by further interaction with the system , then different choices of the @xmath93 at time @xmath60 will render the different histories orthogonal , and hence consistent , at all later times .",
    "this gives us the following picture : the total hilbert space for the system and environment has the form @xmath94 , and the system only interacts with a single subsystem @xmath91 at a given time @xmath60 .",
    "we choose a set of projections @xmath95 onto the state of @xmath91 at each time .",
    "clearly , any history composed of such projections must decohere .",
    "these subsystems @xmath91 are called `` generalized records '' by gell - mann and hartle , because they record the choice @xmath92 for all later times ; they are `` generalized '' because the particular set of degrees of freedom represented by @xmath91 might be very complicated , and inaccessible to an experimenter for all practical purposes @xcite .",
    "this is highly idealized , of course . in a real system",
    "it is usually impossible to identify these subsystems @xmath91 ; the choices of projection are generally not onto these subsystems directly , but instead depend on correlations in the state of the system and environment ; the interaction with the system does not have this precise , time - limited form ; nor does the system generally interact directly with the generalized record",
    ". however , in some cases one _ can _ explicitly identify physical systems which serve as generalized records ( for instance , photons which escape to infinity without interacting further ) ; and even where one can not , it is not unreasonable to assume that something corresponding to them is present @xcite . it may be that in a real environment no subsystem remains forever isolated , but it might be effectively true on timescales very long compared to the duration of the experiment , or even the lifetime of the universe .",
    "in particular , situations which correspond to measurements can almost always be assumed to have some set of generalized records .",
    "sometimes these are easy to identify : lines drawn on graph paper by a measurement apparatus are more than sufficient to cause decoherence of the measurement results at all later times .",
    "photomultiplier tubes are very complicated devices , with the complication doing little to improve understanding of the detection process .",
    "therefore i will use a detector model which is simpler to analyze , based on the techniques used by haroche et al .",
    "@xcite in studying cavity qed in microwave cavities .",
    "models of this type have been used before by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the setup .    the heart of our detector is a lossy cavity which is probed by a beam of atoms .",
    "we assume that the atoms are fairly well localized , so that their motion can be treated as essentially classical",
    ". one mode of this cavity can be excited by photons leaking in from the outside ; this mode has creation and annihilation operators @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we assume that the electronic states of the atoms are prepared in a superposition of two levels , which we label @xmath98 and @xmath99 . if there is an atom in state @xmath99 in the cavity it shifts the resonance frequency .",
    "cavity loss results from interaction between the mode and the internal degrees of freedom of the cavity , which we model as a reservoir of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian for this detector model is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the frequency of the cavity mode , @xmath102 is a projector onto state @xmath99 of the @xmath103th atom , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the creation and annihilation operators for the @xmath106th reservoir oscillator , @xmath107 is its frequency , and @xmath108 is the coupling to the cavity mode . the function @xmath109 is a window function peaked around @xmath110 , which represents the strength of the interaction when the atom is inside the cavity .",

    "( note , though , that in this context , @xmath149 is short compared to the @xmath38 in expression ( [ jumps_prob ] ) .",
    "this is due to the finer - grained nature of this history , about which more below . )      what happens after the external mode has `` registered '' as being in the excited state ? essentially , there are two possibilities : either the external mode can drop back down to the unexcited state ( representing absorption of the photon by the measuring device ) or it will remain in the excited state .",
    "we can examine these two possibilities separately : @xmath221 @xmath222    so we see that the external mode has a probability of roughly @xmath223 per time @xmath149 of dropping back down to the ground state , whereupon it resumes evolution as in ( [ no_jumps ] ) , and a probability of @xmath224 of remaining in the excited state . in either case , the system component of the state continues to evolve according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath209 .",
    "this is exactly the same situation we encountered with ortho - jumps in section iiid .",
    "there , we saw that a typical trajectory spent the majority of time with the output mode in the ground state .",
    "infrequently this mode absorbs a photon from the system and becomes excited ; this photon is dissipated into the environment in a time of order @xmath122 .",
    "the rate for coherent reabsorption by the system is much lower , and can be neglected .",
    "thus , we see that this set of histories corresponds exactly to the set of ortho - jump trajectories at the intermediate timescale @xmath149 .",
    "this is , in fact , a special case of the correspondence shown by disi . in his treatment , the histories were _ branch - dependent _ in order to preserve the orthogonality of the jumps . in ours ,",
    "the jumps are always between two known subspaces , and thus are branch independent .    to reproduce standard jumps , we must coarse - grain just as before .",
    "consider an interval @xmath225 which is long compared to @xmath122 but still short compared to the dynamical timescales of the system .",
    "let @xmath226 be a frequency which characterizes the system hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "then we have @xmath227 .",
    "let us sum all histories which include one jump and re - absorption within this interval ( the probability of multiple jumps is small enough to be neglected ) , and look at the time - propagators occurring inside the trace : @xmath228 with an error of order @xmath229 .",
    "the exact absorption time is irrelevant , since the external mode is traced over , the system dynamics are essentially unaffected , and the probabilities sum to 1 .",
    "so making this coarse - graining , and combining the above cases gives an expression for the probability of a particular jump record of @xmath230 which exactly matches the quantum jump expression ( [ jumps_prob ] ) .",
    "such a histories description is only meaningful if the histories decohere .",
    "exact consistency , as in ( [ decoherence ] ) , is a difficult criterion to meet .",
    "it is more usual to show that a model is _ approximately _ consistent , which generally insures that the histories satisfy the probability sum rules to some level of precision .",
    "one criterion for approximate consistency has been suggested by dowker and halliwell @xcite .",
    "if we wish the probability sum rules to be satisfied to a precision @xmath231 , we require that @xmath232|^2 < \\epsilon^2 d[h , h ] d[h',h ' ] = \\epsilon^2 p(h ) p(h'),\\ ] ] for all unequal pairs of histories @xmath233 . generally speaking , the `` more different ''",
    "a pair of histories is ( i.e. , the more projections they differ in ) , the more suppressed the off - diagonal term .",
    "this is certainly true for this model of photodetection .",
    "so it suffices to look at two histories which are as close as possible without being identical .    in the case of",
    "these `` jump '' histories , this means that these histories differ at a single time @xmath60 , one having a projection @xmath170 , the other @xmath171 . in the decoherence functional ,",
    "this is equivalent to picking out the @xmath234 or @xmath235 component of @xmath236 at that time , sandwiched between identical projectors @xmath170 or @xmath171 on either side .    examining the components given by ( [ expansion][evolutions ] ) and ( [ unexcited][excited ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath237|^2 \\over p(h ) p(h ' ) } \\sim { 1 \\over ( \\gamma_2 \\delta t)^2 } , \\ ] ] so we expect the sum rules to be obeyed with a precision of roughly @xmath238 . for large @xmath172 this is more than adequate .",
    "finkelstein @xcite has suggested an interesting alternative definition for decoherence in the case of a system - environment split , which he terms pt or `` partial trace '' decoherence .",
    "consider the operator - valued functional defined by @xmath239 = \\tr_{\\rm env } \\biggl\\ { \\p^n_{\\alpha_n}(t_n ) \\cdots    \\p^1_{\\alpha_1}(t_1 ) \\rho(t_0 ) \\p^1_{\\alpha_1'}(t_1 ) \\cdots    \\p^n_{\\alpha_n ' } \\biggr\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath240 denotes a partial trace over the environment degrees of freedom only .",
    "@xmath241 $ ] is therefore an operator in the hilbert space @xmath127 .",
    "the criterion for pt decoherence is @xmath239 = 0 , h \\ne h ' , \\label{pt_decoherence}\\ ] ] which is a much stronger condition than the usual decoherence criterion ; it means that the different alternative histories are orthogonal in the environment degrees of freedom alone , implying the existence of generalized records @xcite .    from the form of the standard decoherence",
    "functional and the correspondence with the ortho - jumps unraveling ( [ ortho_eqn1][ortho_eqn2 ] ) , we see that @xmath242 $ ] will be a projector onto the state of the system plus output mode corresponding to the particular trajectory @xmath103 . and",
    "from the equivalence of this to standard jumps , it follows that @xmath243 = \\ket{\\tilde\\psi_h } p(h ) \\bra{\\tilde\\psi_h }    \\otimes ( \\ket0\\bra0\\   { \\rm or}\\   \\ket1\\bra1),\\ ] ] where @xmath244 is the normalized state produced by the quantum jump trajectory corresponding to the history @xmath66 , and @xmath71 is the probability of this trajectory . by exactly the same argument as before ,",
    "the off - diagonal terms vanish and therefore this system is pt decoherent .",
    "as discussed in section iib , one of the most powerful sources of decoherence is the creation of entanglement between `` system '' and `` environment '' degrees of freedom .",
    "because these correlations exist , a careful measurement of the environment could in principle reveal the exact state of the system ; thus , the different possible system states can not interfere , and condition ( [ decoherence ] ) is assured .",
    "gell - mann and hartle term these persistent correlations `` generalized records ; '' they are generalized because in practice the measurement needed to access them might be impossibly difficult .",
    "for instance , suppose a measuring device records a series of results onto a paper tape .",
    "this is a record in the usual sense , and its existence guarantees decoherence between different possible measurement outcomes .",
    "if we then burn the tape , the record becomes difficult to access .",
    "but nevertheless , in principle the information is not lost ; by cleverly measuring the ashes , air , and outgoing light one might in principle be able to reconstruct it , and thus decoherence persists .",
    "this `` in principle ''",
    "recoverable information is a generalized record .",
    "suppose our system and environment begin in an initial pure state .",
    "then the decoherence functional becomes ( [ inner_product ] ) , implying that the unnormalized states @xmath245 are all orthogonal ( or zero ) .",
    "this implies the existence of a set of orthogonal projection operators @xmath246 such that @xmath247 .",
    "any such collection of orthogonal projection operators corresponds to an observable .",
    "thus , in the pure state case , decoherence implies the existence of an observable whose value is exactly correlated with which history occurred .",
    "conversely , the existence of such an observable implies decoherence .",
    "this converse holds even in the case of mixed states .",
    "this observable is the generalized record , and its existence is a stronger consistency criterion than ( [ decoherence ] ) .",
    "if the record is contained entirely in the environment degrees of freedom , so @xmath248 where @xmath249 is a projector on the environment hilbert space alone , it implies the partial trace decoherence ( [ pt_decoherence ] ) of finkelstein .    in the case of our model , the outgoing atoms clearly serve as such a generalized record .",
    "suppose the output mode is in the ground state throughout some period @xmath38 .",
    "in that case , all the outgoing atoms should be in the state @xmath250 .",
    "if the output mode is instead in the excited state , the probability is overwhelming that at least some of the atoms will be found in the state @xmath251 .",
    "thus , these atoms serve as a record of the state of the output mode during the period @xmath38 .    of course",
    ", if the output mode were only in the excited state for a short period , the atoms might fail to record the fact .",
    "but since photons in the output mode persist for an average time of order @xmath252 , this ambiguity is unimportant in practice .",
    "what is more , projections on the states of different atoms commute with each other .",
    "thus we might , in principle , make no assertions about the state of the output mode , but merely wait until a large number of atoms had passed through the detector and then project onto their collective state . this projection would be sufficient to reconstruct the quantum trajectory in its entirety .    in fact",
    ", we can play even more elaborate games than that .",
    "there is no reason , after all , why we should use the same projections on all the atoms .",
    "we might switch from one set to another as we chose . in the language of quantum trajectories",
    ", this would be like switching our choice of unraveling at different times .",
    "indeed , we could go further than this : we could make our choice of projections on some atoms contingent on our results for other atoms .",
    "thus , our choice of unraveling at one time might depend on the state at another time .",
    "what is more , there is no reason that we could not choose our unraveling at early times ( i.e. , the first atoms to pass through ) contingent upon results at later times ( i.e. , the last atoms to pass through ) , rather than the other way around . ordinary quantum trajectories theory does not consider this possibility for good reason , since such a measurement scheme would be extremely difficult in practice , nor",
    "is it obvious what is gained from it , but we can see how the fairly specific assumptions of quantum trajectories can be progressively broadened towards the greater generality of consistent histories .",
    "the existence of generalized records insures that our set of histories will be consistent under all such permutations .",
    "the existence of generalized records also lets us get away from the whole notion of measurement .",
    "suppose that instead of putting a photodetector outside our cavity we put nothing there , and allow emitted photons to escape to infinity .",
    "away from the immediate vicinity of the system , we can describe this external electromagnetic fields in terms of incoming and outgoing plane waves with creation and annihilation operators @xmath253 and @xmath254 , where @xmath255 labels the polarization",
    ". a reasonable initial condition would be that the incoming field is in the vacuum state .",
    "the outgoing field carries away information about the system .",
    "using plane waves makes it difficult to discuss properties which are local in time ; consider instead the operators @xmath256 and @xmath257 defined by @xmath258 which annihilate ( create ) a gaussian wave packet centered at @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "needless to say , these states are overcomplete .",
    "but we can still use them to define operators @xmath261 , which are quasiprojectors onto states with a single photon in phase space region @xmath262 , and act as the identity _ outside _ region @xmath262 . if @xmath262 has a regular boundary , then as the volume of @xmath262 becomes large compared to @xmath263 @xmath261 becomes closer and closer to a true projector .",
    "what is more , if @xmath262 and @xmath264 are nonoverlapping regions , @xmath265 and @xmath266 approximately commute @xcite .",
    "consider now a rectangular region @xmath262 with length @xmath267 much longer than the width of the wave packets , located well outside the near field of the system , and extent in wavenumber space @xmath268 which is large compared to the linewidth of the emitted photons and limited to outgoing photons , centered on the cavity wavenumber @xmath269 .",
    "consider histories with projections @xmath261 and @xmath270 at a series of times @xmath271 .",
    "the projection @xmath272 is essentially a projection on no photon being emitted , since the probabilities of multiple photons or photons outside the frequency range are negligibly small .",
    "this set of histories will correspond on the system space to exactly the set of trajectories ( [ history_prob ] ) we derived before .",
    "time evolution by @xmath38 is just equivalent to shifting the region @xmath262 `` outward '' by a distance @xmath267 .",
    "thus the heisenberg projections @xmath273 which contribute to the history operator ( [ history_op ] ) are actually projectors onto non - overlapping regions , and hence commute .",
    "we could replace them all with the single projector @xmath274 where @xmath275 and @xmath276 , @xmath277 .",
    "the observable represented by the set of projections @xmath278 is a generalized record of the quantum jumps trajectory .",
    "however , just as in the case of the photodetector , we can imagine projecting onto many other things besides photon number , each choice corresponding to a different unraveling . as long as we restrict our projections to outgoing waves , consistency is guaranteed .",
    "if we instead choose to project onto some combination of incoming and outgoing waves , the histories would not be consistent , in general .",
    "this is just as if our measurements of the outgoing field had a chance of reflecting light back into the system ; in that case the condition ( [ traj_consistency ] ) would generally not hold , and the measurement scheme would no longer be an unraveling of the master equation .",
    "again , we might choose one set of projections at one time and another at another , so as to change unravelings , and there is no reason in principle not to make the choice of projections at one time contingent on the results at another .",
    "this freedom leads to a somewhat curious situation .",
    "the outgoing field from the system constitutes a generalized record of the system evolution .",
    "but what is it a record of ? by choosing different measurement schemes , or more generally different consistent descriptions , we can reconstruct very different - looking evolutions .",
    "it has long been known that on the one hand there were many different , incompatible unravelings of the master equation , and on the other many different incompatible sets of consistent histories .",
    "we now see that these can correspond to different , incompatible generalized records .",
    "we have seen how a continuous measurement can be described in terms of decoherent histories , and how the resulting histories match the corresponding quantum trajectory unraveling of the master equation .",
    "the probabilities of the decoherent histories match the weights of the given trajectories , and the off - diagonal terms of the decoherence functional are highly suppressed , as we would expect from a measurement situation .",
    "decoherent histories , as is widely known , must obey a condition ( [ decoherence ] ) for their probabilities to have a consistent interpretation .",
    "what has been less widely appreciated is that quantum trajectories must obey a consistency condition ( [ traj_consistency ] ) of their own .",
    "the reason that this has received so little remark is that all commonly considered unravelings of the master equation automatically satisfy this requirement .",
    "these schemes rely on measurements of an outgoing field , which constitutes a generalized record of the system evolution , guaranteeing that both consistency conditions are obeyed .",
    "the existence of multiple incompatible records creates an interesting ambiguity in our description .",
    "suppose that instead of measuring the field as it is emitted from the system , we wait for a long time and measure the field far away from the system .",
    "our measurements then correspond to information about the system evolution long before , a sort of super - delayed - choice experiment .",
    "the choice of unraveling might be delayed until long after the evolution itself is complete .",
    "were there no quantum trajectories until the measurement occurred ?",
    "does one trajectory `` really '' happen ?",
    "do all of them somehow coexist ?",
    "these are the sort of interpretational questions upon which gallons of ink can be spent without putting an end to argument . from a practical point of view , it does nt matter .",
    "the fact that these sets of histories are consistent means that we can choose an unraveling and make arguments based on the trajectories without fear that inconsistencies will invalidate our results . while there may be no actual measurement record , in the cases we consider the existence of generalized records serves the same function . while these generalized records might be hard to identify , and even harder to measure ( especially if they depart at the speed of light ) , they insure that distinct alternatives remain distinct , and can not subsequently interfere with each other .",
    "this is a valuable fact , especially since real measurements rarely approach the level of perfection commonly assumed for pure state unravelings .",
    "if these unravelings decohere from each other , they can be treated like classical alternatives without fear of contradictions arising .",
    "imperfect measurements can then be treated by further coarse - graining of these histories .",
    "what is more , if there are many different unravelings corresponding to different sets of decoherent histories , the choice of which to use can become a matter of convenience .",
    "in some situations a jump - like description is most useful ; in others , a diffusion equation . it might be possible to use either one by an appropriate choice of projection operators on the same environment .",
    "consistent histories is a powerful formalism , but producing a full set of histories can be dauntingly difficult , especially as their number increases exponentially with the number of projections . in practical calculations ,",
    "it is often far easier to randomly choose some subset of `` typical '' histories and average over them . for this ,",
    "quantum trajectory equations are supremely well - suited .",
    "once again , the freedom to choose among different but equivalent formulations of a problem is a boon to the theorist .    over the last several years",
    "a great deal of work has been done on problems of quantum measurement , from a wide variety of viewpoints .",
    "i believe that these approaches , to the extent that they are correct , are connected at a deep level , and that by understanding the connections their power can be enhanced .",
    "this work is a small step in that direction .",
    "i have no doubt that much more progress is to come .",
