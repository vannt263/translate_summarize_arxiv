    "optimal feedback controls for evolutionary control systems are of significant practical importance . differently from open - loop optimal controls ,",
    "they do not rely on knowledge of the initial condition and they can achieve design objectives , as for instance stabilisation , also in the presence of perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the online synthesis of feedback control can be implemented in a real - time setting .",
    "it is well - known that their construction relies on special hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the solution of the hjb equation is the value function associated to the optimal control problem , and its gradient is used to construct the optimal feedback control . in the very special , but important case of a linear control system with quadratic cost without constraints on the control or the state variables , the hjb equation reduces to a riccati equation which has received a tremendous amount of attention , both for the cases when the control system is related to ordinary or to partial differential equations .",
    "otherwise one has to deal with the hjb equation which is a partial differential equation whose spatial dimension is that of the control system .",
    "thus optimal feedback control for partial differential equations leads to hjb equations in infinite dimensions @xcite .",
    "after semi - discretization in space of the controlled partial differential equation ( pde ) , the hjb equation is posed in a space of dimension corresponding to the spatial discretization of the pde @xcite . for standard finite element or finite difference discretizations this leads to high - dimensional hjb equations .",
    "this is one of the instances which is referred to as _ the curse of dimensionality _ @xcite .",
    "many attempts to tackle the difficulties posed for numerically solving the hjb equations arising in optimal control have been made in the past or are currently being investigated .",
    "we refer , for instance , to @xcite , which mainly focuses on semi - lagrangian schemes , and further references given there .",
    "a related approach to numerical optimal feedback control of pdes is to semi - discretize the dynamics and to add a model order reduction step , either with balanced truncation or proper orthogonal decomposition , in order to reduce the dimension of the dynamics to a number that is tractable for grid - based , semi - lagrangian schemes .",
    "this approach has been successfully explored , for instance , in @xcite and references therein .",
    "it strongly relies on a trustworthy representation of the dynamics via low - dimensional manifolds .",
    "such a low - dimensional representation may deteriorate when nonlinear and/or advection effects are relevant .",
    "thus , it is important to strive for techniques , or combinations of techniques , which allow to solve higher dimensional problems .",
    "another direction of research evolves around generalizing the riccati - based approach to allow for nonlinearities in the state equation .",
    "one such technique is termed state - dependent riccati equation @xcite . here",
    "the coefficients in the ordinary riccati equation are functions of the state rather than constants as in the case of linear state equations .",
    "another approach realizes the fact that the riccati equation can be interpreted as the equation satisfied by the first term arising in the power series expansion of the value function , and attempts to improve by realizing also higher order terms in the expansion .",
    "these methods are succinctly explained in @xcite .",
    "yet another technique which has received a considerable amount of attention is termed successive galerkin approximation .",
    "roughly speaking , the nonlinear hjb equation associated to the continuous - time optimal control problem is solved by means of a newton method . at each iteration ,",
    "the control law is fixed .",
    "this leads to a generalized hamilton - jacobi equation ( ghjb ) which is linear .",
    "the iteration is closed by an update of the control law based on the gradient of the value function .",
    "this method was intensively investigated in @xcite , see also @xcite , and the references given in these citations .",
    "it is worth to mention that the discrete - time counterpart of this method corresponds to the well - known policy iteration or howards algorithm @xcite .",
    "the numerical examples in @xcite do not go beyond dimension five , and most , if not all , of the published numerical results for nonlinear hjb equations do not exceed dimension eight @xcite .",
    "an alternative sparse grid approach for high - dimensional approximation of hjb equations based on open - loop optimal control has been presented in @xcite , with tests up to dimension six .",
    "numerical methods relying on tensor calculus have been shown to perform well in high - dimensional settings where the associated hjb equation is a linear pde @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , to solve optimal control problems for certain classes of semilinear parabolic equations we shall proceed as follows . to accommodate the curse of dimensionality , the discretization of the pde is based on a pseudospectral collocation method , allowing a higher degree of accuracy with relatively few collocation points . to solve the resulting hjb we utilize a newton method based on the ghjb equation as described above .",
    "next , the discretization of the ghjb equation is addressed through a galerkin approximation with polynomial , globally supported , ansatz functions .",
    "while this mitigates the curse of dimensionality in terms of removing the mesh structure , it leads to high - dimensional integrals .",
    "we therefore resort to separable representations for the system dynamics and for the basis set of the polynomial approximation .",
    "the separability assumption reduces the computation of the galerkin residual equation to products of one - dimensional integrals .",
    "the combination of these procedures allowed us to solve hjb equations related to nonlinear control systems up to dimension fourteen by means of basic parallelization tools .",
    "the successful use of the newton procedure requires to provide a feasibly initialization , i.e. a sub - optimal , stabilizing control .",
    "since we do not consider constraints , this is not restrictive for finite horizon problem , but can be challenging for infinite horizon problems , and specifically for the stabilization problems which are considered in the present paper . in this respect",
    "we developed a continuation procedure based on the use of a discount factor .",
    "specifically , we consider a nested iterative procedure : within the outer loop the value of a positive discount factor is driven to zero , within the inner loop the hjb equation is solved approximately for a fixed discount factor . with this approach , which , is summarized in algorithms [ alg : sga1 ] and [ alg : sga2 ] below",
    ", we managed to solve optimal feedback stabilization problems for semilinear parabolic equations with different stability behavior of the desired steady state .",
    "let us give a brief outline of the paper .",
    "section 2 sets the stage and provides the discussion of a special case to facilitate the understanding of the following material . in section 3",
    "the solution process of the hjb equation is detailed . in section 4",
    "we provide the formulas which are needed to numerically realize the discretized hjb equation after a separable basis has been chosen .",
    "numerical experiments are documented in section 5 . there",
    "we can also find comparisons to suboptimal feedback strategies based on riccati and asymptotic expansion techniques .",
    "we consider the following undiscounted infinite horizon optimal control problem :    @xmath0 subject to the nonlinear dynamical constraint @xmath1 where we denote the state @xmath2 , the control @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , the state running cost @xmath5 , and the control penalization @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , we assume the running cost and the system dynamics @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be @xmath9 . throughout it",
    "is assumed that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "our focus is therefore asymptotic stabilization to the origin .",
    "it is well - known that the optimal value function @xmath12 characterizing the solution of this infinite horizon control problem is the unique viscosity solution of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "here we follow the convention of dropping the subscript of @xmath15 .",
    "we study this equation in the unconstrained case , i.e. , @xmath16 , where the explicit minimizer @xmath17 of is given by @xmath18 note that by inserting this expression for the optimal control in , we obtain the equivalent hjb equation @xmath19 which under further assumptions can be simplified to the riccati equation associated to linear - quadratic infinite horizon optimal feedback control .",
    "the methodology we present in this work is applicable to systems fitting the aforedescribed setting , although for the sake of simplicity we restrict the presentation by the following choices :    * the control @xmath20 is a scalar variable , i.e. @xmath21 . *",
    "the running cost @xmath22 is quadratic , i.e. @xmath23 , with @xmath24 positive - definite , * the control term @xmath25 is a constant vector in @xmath26 .    at this point ,",
    "our setting differs from the linear - quadratic case as it allows nonlinear dynamics , and nonquadratic state costs . for the numerical scheme that we develop ,",
    "the following assumption is crucial :    [ as:1 ] the free dynamics @xmath27 are separable in every coordinate @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a tensor - valued function . in the case",
    "@xmath31 , then we shall also assume a similar separable structure for @xmath32 .      in the following ,",
    "we illustrate how the presented framework sets the grounds for a computational approach for approximate optimal feedback controllers for nonlinear pdes .",
    "we consider the following optimal stabilization problem :    @xmath33    subject to the semilinear parabolic equation @xmath34\\ , , t\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^+,\\\\ { \\partial_{\\xi } x}(-1,t)&={\\partial_{\\xi } x}(1,t)=0\\,,\\quad x(\\xi,0)=x_0\\,.\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , the scalar control acts through the indicator function @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . at the abstract level , this corresponds to an infinite - dimensional optimal control problem .",
    "a first step towards the application of the proposed framework is the space discretization of the system dynamics , leading to finite - dimensional state space representation .",
    "the use of the pseudospectral collocation methods for parabolic equations has been studied in @xcite , and leads to a state space representation of the form @xmath37 where the discrete state @xmath38 corresponds to the approximation of @xmath39 at @xmath40 collocation points @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the coordinatewise power .",
    "the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 are finite - dimensional approximations of the laplacian and control operators , respectively .",
    "such a discretization of the dynamics directly fulfills the separability required in assumption [ as:1 ] , as the i - th equation of the dynamics reads @xmath46 with a separability degree @xmath47 .",
    "it is very important to note that semidiscretization in space of a wide class of time - dependent pdes will lead to finite - dimensional state space representations of this type , thus the applicability of the presented framework is only limited by the dimensionality of the associated hjb equation .",
    "this motivates the choice of a pseudospectral collocation method for the discretization , as it is possible to obtain a meaningful representation of the dynamics with considerably fewer degrees of freedom than classical low - order schemes .",
    "however , if pseudospectral collocation is not a suitable discretization method for the dynamics , model reduction procedures such as balanced truncation , proper orthogonal decomposition , or reduced basis techniques shall also lead to separable state - space representations .",
    "once the finite - dimensional state state space representation is obtained , we proceed to approximate the solution of the associated hjb equation , leading to the optimal feedback controller .",
    "we now present a preview of the numerical results of the proposed approach .",
    "further details of the numerical scheme will be developed in the forthcoming sections .",
    "the system dynamics in , are approximated in 12 collocation points ( 14 with b.c.s ) , and therefore our approximation scheme seeks for a solution of a 12-dimensional hjb equation , which allows the computation of online optimal feedback controllers .",
    "we compare our hjb - based controller ( hjb ) to the linear - quadratic controller ( lqr ) obtained by linearization of the system dynamics , and to an approximation method for the hjb equation based on power series expansion ( pse ) @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] we observe the basic features of the dynamics and the control schemes .",
    "the uncontrolled system dynamics ( diffusion+dissipative source term ) are stable , but stabilization is extremely slow .",
    "the control algorithms considerably reduce the transient phase",
    ". however , the control signals are different , and the hjb - based controller generates a feedback control with reduced overall cost . observe that at the beginning of the time horizon even the signs of the lqr- , pse- , and hjb - based controls differ .    .",

    "in this section , we construct a numerical scheme for the approximation of the hjb equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we recall two additional features in this equation which render the application of classical approximation techniques difficult : the absence of a variational formulation , and the minimization with respect to the control variable @xmath51 , which makes the hjb equation fully nonlinear .",
    "the simplest numerical approach to these problems is the use of monotone , grid - based discretizations ( finite differences , semi - lagrangian ) , in conjunction with a fixed point iteration for the value function @xmath52 which typically depends on the use of a discount factor .",
    "the so - called `` value iteration '' procedure was first presented by bellman in @xcite , and although it has become a standard solution method for low - dimensional hjb equations , it suffers from three major drawbacks .",
    "first , the grid - based character of the scheme makes it inapplicable for high - dimensional dynamics , as the total number of degrees of freedom scales exponentially with respect to the dimension of the dynamical system .",
    "this corresponds to the most classical statement of the so - called _ curse of dimensionality_. second , the contractive mapping includes a minimization procedure which needs to be solved for every grid point at every iteration .",
    "third , the lipschitz constant of the contractive mapping goes to 1 when the discretization parameter goes to 0 , becoming extremely slow for fine - mesh solutions .",
    "in order to circumvent these limitations , we develop a numerical scheme combining an iteration on the control variable rather than the value function , together with a polynomial expansion for the value function to mitigate the computational burden associated to mesh - based schemes .      in the following ,",
    "we revisit the method presented in @xcite , which is referred as successive approximation algorithm .",
    "we begin by defining the set of admissible controls .",
    "we say that a feedback mapping @xmath53 is admissible on @xmath54 , denoted as @xmath55 , if @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "starting from an admissible initial guess @xmath60 , the successive approximation algorithm ( algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] below ) generates the pair @xmath61 which solves equation .",
    "algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] corresponds to a newton method for solving equation , and in the linear - quadratic setting it is equivalent to the newton - kleinmann iteration for solving the riccati equation .",
    "it can be also directly identified with the policy iteration algorithm for hjb equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) , although in this context the usual setting includes a discount factor which relaxes the admissibility assumption , as well as discrete - time dynamics .",
    "consequently , it is applied to a bellman equation with no continuous gradient . in both cases ,",
    "the core ingredient of the algorithm is to generate a decreasing sequence of values @xmath62 by solving an associated sequence of linear problems . in our case",
    "this translates into solving , for a given @xmath63 at each iteration , the generalized hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( ghjb ) equation @xmath64 the following result from @xcite summarizes relevant properties of the ghjb equation .",
    "[ tghjb ] if @xmath65 is a compact subset of @xmath26 , @xmath66 is lipschitz continuous on @xmath65 and @xmath10 , @xmath67 is strictly increasing in @xmath65 , @xmath6 , and @xmath55 , then :    1 .",
    "there exists a unique @xmath68 satisfying . 2 .",
    "@xmath69 is a lyapunov function of the controlled system .",

    "the update @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 , then @xmath76 for all @xmath71 .",
    "a critical aspect of the successive approximation algorithm [ alg : sga1 ] is its initialization , which requires the existence of an admissible control @xmath60 which in view of means that it asymptotically stabilizes all the initial conditions in @xmath65 . for",
    "asymptotically stable dynamics , this is trivially satisfied by @xmath77 . for more general cases ,",
    "the computation of stabilizing feedback controllers is a challenging task .",
    "a partial answer is to consider the stabilizing feedback associated to the linearized system dynamics .",
    "however , this feedback is only locally stabilizing , and therefore the identification of a suitable domain @xmath65 where this control law is admissible becomes relevant . for low dimensional dynamics , this has been studied in the context of zubov s method in @xcite . an alternative solution that we propose is to consider a discounted infinite horizon control problem    @xmath78 where the inclusion of the discount factor @xmath79 relaxes the admissibility condition .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the link between discounted optimal control and asymptotic stabilization has been discussed , and under certain conditions , the discounted control problem can generate optimal controls that are also admissible for the undiscounted problem .",
    "we recall that the associated hjb equation for the infinite horizon optimal control problem is given by @xmath80 and the associated ghjb reads @xmath81 we consequently modify the successive approximation algorithm in order to embed it within a path - following iteration with respect to the discount factor :    for a sufficiently large @xmath79 , this algorithm can be initialized with @xmath82 .",
    "continued reduction of the discount factor using hotstart every time when is called with a reduced @xmath79-value , leads to an approximate solution of equation .",
    "so far we have discussed the iterative aspects of a computational method for solving hjb equations .",
    "we now address the numerical approximation of the ghjb equation .",

    ", we further assume that the dynamics @xmath97 are polynomial ( as illustrated in section [ pdesub ] ) .",
    "therefore , under the assumptions of theorem 26 in @xcite , by choosing a multidimensional monomial basis ( of degree @xmath98 ) and an admissible control @xmath99 , it can be established that , @xmath100 , @xmath101 such that for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "we now focus on the different terms involved in the approximation of the ghjb equation .",
