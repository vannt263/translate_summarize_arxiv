    "interactions of neutral atoms in their ground states with atoms in highly excited rydberg states attracted considerable scientific attention ( @xcite and references therein ) since fermi s development of the theory explaining pressure shifts of atomic rydberg spectral lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered that the pair of atoms with one of them in the excited state and the other in the ground state ( perturber ) , can form a long - range rydberg molecules with large internuclear distances and unusual properties ( trilobite states ) @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite in their theoretical work predicted that another class of long - range rydberg molecular states arises when the electron interaction with the perturber exhibits a shape resonance ( butterfly states ) .",
    "these theoretical findings were experimentally verified @xcite and they have been the focus of numerous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations .",
    "it was found that the temperature and density of the alkali - metal atoms in a bose - einstein condensate are particularly favorable for the laser excitation of these long - range molecular rydberg states .",
    "initial theoretical papers @xcite predicted the existence of the trilobite and butterfly states of rb@xmath2 at internuclear distances in the range @xmath3a.u . with energies corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "those works are based on an assumption that the interaction of the rydberg electron with the neutral perturber can be approximated using the fermi s pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "however , the measurements @xcite were performed at lower energies corresponding to @xmath5 and they show similar bound states of rb@xmath2 in this energy range . calculations of the model potential energy curves ( pecs ) in this range of energies based on the fermi s pseudopotential show local minima @xcite that can be assigned to the measured spectral lines corresponding to the bound states . however , those minima of the pecs are located at internuclear distances @xmath6a.u .",
    "those values are considerably below the range @xmath3a.u . for which the theory by @xcite was originally developed .",
    "although the qualitative agreement of the theoretical models with the experimental spectra is encouraging , the quantitative validity of the fermi s pseudopotential at shorter internuclear distances is not entirely clear .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a computational method that is capable of treating this range of smaller internuclear separations ( @xmath7a.u . ) and lower energies corresponding to @xmath8 from the first principles .",
    "this will allow us to test the validity of fermi s pseudopotential under these conditions .",
    "it is necessary to mention that more recent experimental works @xcite focus on the energies corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "the measured results are in agreement with the theoretical model by @xcite applied to rb@xmath2 at internuclear separations @xmath10a.u .",
    "@xcite developed an _ ab initio_method to calculate the pecs and dipole moments of the long - range excited molecular states . in this work the rydberg atom is represented by the electron in the coulomb potential , while the effects of the electronic structure of the atomic core are included in the calculation as a correction of the coulomb wave functions parametrized by the quantum defects @xcite .",
    "the positively charged atomic core is placed at the distance @xmath0 from the neutral perturber that is represented by the short - range model potential in two lowest partial waves .",
    "the one - electron schrdinger equationwith both potentials is solved in the sphere centered around the perturber and with a radius that allows the short - range model potential to vanish outside the sphere . the general solutions and their derivatives",
    "are then smoothly matched on the sphere with the wave function in the outer region . that matching is performed in terms of the coulomb green s function@xcite , since the only potential considered in the outer region is due to the positive charge of the rydberg core .",
    "this technique guarantees that the correct bound - state asymptotic boundary conditions are satisfied and also that the complicated structure of the wave function in the outer region is treated analytically . in fact , it is necessary to evaluate the coulomb green s functionand its radial derivative only on the matching sphere and the wave function elsewhere in the outer region does not explicitly appear in the calculation . due to the bound - state boundary conditions ,",
    "the wave function in the inner region can be smoothly matched with the wave function in the outer region only for discrete values of the energy that are identified as the adiabatic energies of the bound states .",
    "the method by @xcite takes into account the finite size of the perturber as well as the variation of the coulomb potential of the other positively charged atomic center throughout the region of the perturber .",
    "this effect becomes more relevant with decreasing internuclear separation .",
    "the two - electron computational method developed in this work is a generalization of the approach introduced by @xcite .",
    "particularly , the representation of the perturber and its interaction with the rydberg atom is more advanced . since the experimental studies dealing with the long - range molecular states are mainly focused on the systems involving alkali - metal atoms that can be well represented by single electron in the model potential , the approach developed in this paper is also based on that one - electron representation of the perturber .",
    "the interaction of the rydberg electron with the valence electron of the perturber is a true two - electron repulsion .",
    "the additional degree of freedom due to the valence electron allows us to include the effect of the low excited states of the perturber in the theoretical model .",
    "it is particularly practical in the studies of systems , where the molecular rydberg states associated with the second ionization threshold at energies below the first ionization threshold exist .",
    "rb@xmath2 is a good example of such system , since the energy of the dissociation channel @xmath11 is between the energies of the dissociation channels @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the two - electron formulation of the problem also allows us to treat the interaction of the perturber with the rydberg electron more accurately .",
    "this is because the couplings between the rydberg electron and the valence electron of the neutral perturber are in the present model treated in _",
    "ab initio_manner .",
    "only the closed - shell core of the perturber is represented by a model potential , while in the reference @xcite whole the neutral perturber was approximated by the model potential .",
    "that approximation required to introduce different model potentials for different spin states ( singlet and triplet ) .    the parameters of the model potential employed in @xcite to represent the perturber are optimized to reproduce its electron affinity along with the energies and widths of the low - energy atomic resonances .",
    "that interaction potential is restricted to two lowest partial waves ( with respect to the center of the perturber ) , since the low - energy electron interaction with the neutral perturber in higher partial waves is predominated by the repulsive centrifugal barrier that prevents the electron from `` probing '' the details of the electronic structure of the perturber .",
    "however , the presence of another positively charged atomic core can reduce the strength of the repulsive centrifugal barrier and the rydberg electron may be able to penetrate deeper into the perturber in higher partial waves .     in the valence region of the perturber ( its core is located at @xmath14 ) along the inernuclear axis @xmath15 calculated for different internuclear distances @xmath0 and for the partial waves @xmath16 .",
    "the red curve denotes the potential in the absence of the other positively charged atomic core ( @xmath17).[fig : penetscheme ] ]    this mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : penetscheme ] .",
    "it shows the model potential @xmath18 of rb@xmath19 in the presence of another positively charged atomic core calculated along the internuclear axis for several values of the distance @xmath0 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a model potential taken from the reference @xcite [ eq . ( 17 ) ] , @xmath22a.u . is the static dipole polarizability of the rubidium atom @xcite and @xmath23 is the angular momentum with respect to the center of the perturber . for the purpose of this qualitative analysis",
    "it is sufficient to assume that the atomic potential beyond the core of rb is predominated by the polarization potential .",
    "[ fig : penetscheme ] shows that if the other positively charged core is sufficiently close , its coulomb potential lowers the barrier for @xmath24 as well as for @xmath25 so that the electron in a higher rydberg state can classically penetrate into the valence region .",
    "therefore , the representation of the perturber in @xmath25 at smaller internculear separations is also necessary . on the other hand ,",
    "the centrifugal barrier for @xmath26 is so repulsive that even when the other core is as close as @xmath27a.u . from the center of ther perturber ,",
    "it is not able to reduce the repulsive barrier enough and the peak of @xmath18 has a positive value .",
    "therefore , it is difficult for an rydberg electron in the @xmath28-wave with any negative energy to penetrate into the perturber space defined by @xmath29a.u .",
    "of course , the importance of this effect depends on the size of the perturber and on its distance from the positively charged rydberg core . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : penetscheme ] , the model potential employed by @xcite for @xmath30 and @xmath24 is suitable and sufficient for the range of the internuclear separations considered in the reference @xcite .",
    "the contributions with the higher values of @xmath23 become relevant only at considerably smaller internuclear distances that are the focus of the present study .",
    "two - electron approach to the problem developed in this paper treats the mechanism described above without a need to construct different perturber potentials for different partial waves .",
    "another important technical difference between the approach developed in @xcite and the present paper is the method used to solve the schrdinger equationin the inner region . while @xcite perform a direct propagation of the solutions from the center of the sphere to the boundary with careful treatment of the spin - orbit coupling , present work employs the _",
    "r_-matrixmethod , where the logarithmic derivative of the wave function on the sphere is calculated and used to ensure the smooth matching to the solution in the outer region .",
    "the spin - orbit effects are not considered in the present work .",
    "this paper is focused on the detailed derivation of the two - electron _",
    "r_-matrixapproach to the rydberg molecular states .",
    "a simple application to h@xmath2 is discussed and the results are compared with previously published simple models to show that it yields correct energies .",
    "its application to rb@xmath2 and other alkali - metal dimers will be subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the two - electron computational method is derived in section [ sec : rmatmethod ] , the numerical aspects of the calculations are discussed in section [ sec : numeri ] , the results obtained using this method for h@xmath2 are presented in section [ sec : secresults ] and section [ sec : coclusions ] contains the conclusions .",
    "atomic units are employed throughout the paper , unless stated otherwise .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , let us introduce a coordinate system with the center located on the nucleus of the neutral perturber @xmath31(fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "the other positively charged center @xmath32of the rydberg atom is located on the negative part of the axis @xmath15 and its distance from @xmath31is denoted as @xmath0 .",
    "axis @xmath15 is also the quantization axis .",
    "position vectors of the electrons are denoted @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "coordinate system used in this work with the center on the nucleus of the perturber @xmath31 . the nucleus of the rydberg core @xmath32is located at @xmath35 .",
    "position vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 centered on the origin describe the coordinates of the first and second electron , respectively .",
    "position vectors with respect to the nucleus of the core @xmath32are denoted as @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]    the atomic cores @xmath31and @xmath32are represented by the spherical model potentials @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the prime in the coordinate denotes that it is taken relatively to the center @xmath32 , while the unprimed coordinate is relative to the core @xmath31 .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath41 have attractive coulomb character beyond certain distance from the corresponding core , typically few atomic units .",
    "the short - range part of the potential @xmath40 is optimized to reproduce the energies of the ground and excited states of the perturber with respect to the atomic ionization threshold .",
    "although @xmath38 can be @xmath23-dependent ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , such dependence is not needed in this work .",
    "the short - range part of @xmath41 does not explicitly appear in the calculation .",
    "interaction of the rydberg electron with core @xmath32 is parametrized by the quantum defects @xcite .",
    "electronic hamiltonian of the whole system is @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the operators of the kinetic energy for electrons 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the last term is the coulomb repulsion of the electrons and @xmath45",
    ".    this work deals with such electronic states of the two - electron system , where at least one electron always appears close to the core @xmath31(valence electron ) and where the internuclear separation @xmath0 is large enough so that all the region of the valence electron is located in the coulomb tail of @xmath41 and does not overlap with the core @xmath32 .",
    "the rydberg electron is asymptotically bound by @xmath41 and its wave function may reach or even exceed the perturber .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to introduce the sphere @xmath46 centered on the nucleus of the perturber with such radius @xmath47 that whole the region of the space , where the two electrons can appear simultaneously , is confined inside @xmath46 ( fig .  [ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "the basis for the _ r_-matrixformulation of the problem is provided by the separation of the space to two regions .",
    "the region inside the sphere @xmath46 accounts for an antisymmetry of the two - electron wave function and the effects of the electron correlation .",
    "the region outside the sphere @xmath46 deals with a single rydberg electron and matching of its wave function with the two - electron wave function in the inner region can be done in terms of the coulomb green s function@xcite .",
    "this imposes the proper boundary conditions and treats the coulomb singularity analytically .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to construct any basis set to represent the complicated spatial structure of the one - electron wave function outside @xmath46 that spreads over relatively large region of the space .",
    "the restriction that both electrons can simultaneously appear only inside @xmath46 and at most one of them around the core @xmath32 , leads to an asymmetry in the representation of the studied system .",
    "it means that even in the case of the homonuclear molecule the computational method discussed here can not correctly represent the gerade or ungerade symmetry of the two - electron wave function .",
    "that may seem like an important deficiency of this computational approach .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that it is designed for sufficiently large internuclear distances @xmath0 and for such energy range , where the gerade and ungerade states of the homonuclear systems form nearly degenerate pairs @xcite .",
    "the states where both electrons can simultaneously appear only in the vicinity of the atomic core @xmath31 , can be represented by the linear combinations of those degenerate wave functions .",
    "the situation is different in case of heteronuclear systems , since it is usually obvious , for the given energy range of the interest , which atom is in the valence state and which is in the rydberg state .",
    "let us consider now the low bound states of the diatomic cation system as described above , i.e. in the absence of the rydberg electron .",
    "when @xmath0 is sufficiently large , the bound state is predominately determined by the potential @xmath38 and the effect of the coulomb tail of @xmath48 has only perturbative character .",
    "corresponding one - particle hamiltonian @xmath49 commutes with the projection of the angular momentum on the internuclear axis @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalue @xmath51 of @xmath50 is a good quantum number and it can be used to categorize the eigenstates of @xmath52 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath47 is large enough to confine few lowest solutions @xmath53 of the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath54 with the bound - state boundary conditions .",
    "these eigenstates can represent the scattering channels of the problem .",
    "the orthonormality of @xmath53 is assumed in the rest of this paper .",
    "when it is desirable to express the parametric dependence of the channel energies on the internuclear separation @xmath0 , it will be denoted as @xmath55 in the remaining part of this paper .      in order to calculate the _ r _",
    "matrixon the sphere @xmath46 variationally , we expand the solutions @xmath56 of the schrdinger equation @xmath57 in the inner region in terms of the basis functions . in the present study",
    "we choose antisymmetric two - electron basis functions coupled to form a state of definite total angular momentum @xmath58 , total electronic spin @xmath59 and parity @xmath60 .",
    "this choice for basis set may seem detrimental since @xmath58 is not a good quantum number of the diatomic system .",
    "however , the only term in the hamiltonian that violates the rotational symmetry is the potential @xmath41 that is a smooth function inside the sphere @xmath46 . we will show that @xmath41 generates in the inner region a weak @xmath58-coupling that can be expressed by a finite series expansion of the multipole type .",
    "one - particle version of this approach has been utilized by @xcite , where the off - center coulomb potential couples the eigenstates of the operator @xmath61 , since the @xmath62-coupling scheme has been employed by the authors .",
    "the theoretical studies of the photoionization spectroscopy of two - electron rydberg atoms ( see  @xcite and references therein ) are based on similar approach , where the dipole electric field couples different eigenstates of @xmath63 .",
    "following @xcite , the two - electron basis function is expressed in terms of the one - electron radial orbitals and angular spherical harmonics : @xmath64/(r_1r_2),\\label{eq:2ebasis }              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the angular momenta of the first and second electron , respectively .",

[",
    "fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "the two - electron angular functions @xmath75 are the spherical harmonics in the angular coordinates of both electrons coupled by the clebsch - gordon coefficients to form the eigenstates of @xmath63 and @xmath68 , as it is usual in the addition of two angular momenta  @xcite .",
    "@xmath76 is the normalization factor  @xcite . since @xmath67 is the conserved quantum number of the system studied here , it will be skipped from the notation of the basis functions and corresponding matrix elements in the rest of the paper .",

    "the two - particle basis function , where @xmath92 is @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , is denoted closed ( open ) .",
    "the absence of the two - particle basis functions with two electrons in the open orbitals reflects that at most one electron can escape from the reaction volume .",
    "while the open and closed categories of the radial orbitals and two - particle basis functions introduced above have the same meaning as in the reference @xcite , the character of the open subset is very different .",
    "@xcite obtained all the radial orbitals by the numerical integration of eq .",
    "on the grid .",
    "the closed orbitals @xmath77 were calculated in such way that the boundary conditions and were imposed .",
    "these closed orbitals are similar to those introduced in this work , only the method of integration is different .",
    "however , the open orbitals in the reference @xcite were obtained by the numerical integration of the differential equation with the boundary condition in the center for arbitrary energy @xmath85 without imposing any boundary condition at @xmath47 .",
    "of course , the selection of the energy was physically motivated .",

    "the lower inset of that figure shows that for @xmath252a.u . , the ion - pair pec is slightly diverted from its asymptotic form @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the electron affinity of h. this is another consequence of the increased polarization of the perurber by the core @xmath32at smaller @xmath0 .",

    "moreover , the results of @xcite for higher energies are also in good agreement with the findings presented here .",
    "the accuracy of the ion - pair pec is sensitive predominately to the quality of the representation of the two - electron interaction in the inner region , since the probability density of the rydberg electron in this state is well localized around the perturber .",
    "it is the convergence of this ion - pair pec in our calculations that requires the set of the closed two - electron basis functions larger than the subset of the open functions .    as can be seen in fig .",

    "the colors and the notation has the same meaning as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowstates].[fig : assem ] ]    ( other than the ion - pair curve ) can be divided into two categories : the pecs of the first type follow the shape of the @xmath258 pec of h@xmath259 at large internuclear separations and they are located at energies very close below the nirts ( see also the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : curdetail ] ) .",
    "these pecs represent the rydberg states weakly affected by the neutral perturber . for the energy interval of the interest in this work",
    "these pecs coincide with the associated nirts at @xmath260a.u .",
    "the pecs of the second type are more interesting .",
    "they are located at energies between the pairs of subsequent nirts at smaller internuclear separations and each of them decreases with increasing @xmath0 until it coincides with the lower nirt .",
    "pecs of both types show an oscillatory structure that is better pronounced in the second - type pecs .",
    "these undulations can be understood in terms of the simplified model developed by @xcite to predict the trilobite - like states of rb@xmath2 @xcite . in their single - electron approach the perturber",
    "is represented by fermi s contact pseudopotential and the rydberg center by the pure coulomb potential ( the non - hydrogen character of rb is neglected ) .",
    "the eigenstates of this model system are expressed as linear combinations of such eigenfunctions @xmath261 of the hydrogen - atom hamiltonian that are separable in the prolate spheroidal coordinates @xcite with the foci located on the atomic cores .",
    "the quantum number @xmath262 is set to zero , since only the @xmath263 states are considered . the quantum number @xmath148 denotes different degenerate eigenstates with the same @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite showed that in case of rb@xmath2 every minimum in the oscillations of the pec corresponds to such values of @xmath0 , where the sum in eq .",
    "is dominated by one spheroidal eigenstate of the rydberg electron .",

    "@xcite .",
    "more specifically , the peaks of the spheroidal eigenstates correspond to the local maxima of the oscillations in the pecs . this behavior is different from the case of rb@xmath2 discussed by @xcite , where the positions of the peaks of the spheroidal atomic eigenstates coincide with the minima of the oscillations .",
    "an explanation is quite simple : the scattering length @xmath266 in eq .",
    "is negative for hydrogen and positive for rubidium @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results of our two - electron _",
    "r_-matrixcalculations with those obtained by the application of the approach developed by @xcite and @xcite to h@xmath2 .",

    "all the terms where @xmath271 appears in the second and higher order will be neglected here . following @xcite",

    "[ fig : curdetail ] .",
    "it is in encouraging qualitative agreement with the two - electron _",
    "r_-matrixcalculations , including the details of the oscillatory structure .",
    "it is not surprising that the agreement is excellent at larger internuclear separations ( @xmath273a.u . ) and that the results of the one - electron model increasingly divert from the pec calculated using the two - electron _",
    "r_-matrixapproach with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "comparable agreement between the fermi s model and two - electron _",
    "r_-matrixcalculations was observed for all the energies and internuclear separations @xmath0 explored in this paper .",
    "this is a consequence of the finite size of the perturber that plays more important role at smaller internuclear separations , while the representation by the fermi s contact pseudopotential reduces the interaction with the perturber to a single spatial point .",
    "fermi s pseudopotential @xcite @xmath274\\delta^3(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{pert}}),\\ ] ] previously applied to rb@xmath2 @xcite , is parametrized to treat a collision of a free electron with a neutral target . while this model holds very well for large internuclear separations ( @xmath275a.u .",
    "@xcite ) , some of its assumptions cease to be accurate at smaller distances @xmath0 explored in this paper .",
    "for instance , the dipole moment of the neutral atom gained in the presence of the potential @xmath41 becomes relevant inside the sphere @xmath46 , although we neglect it in the outer region .",
    "moreover , variation of @xmath41 inside the sphere @xmath46 is larger for smaller @xmath0 and the validity of the free - electron scattering model becomes questionable .",
    "we attempt to account for this deficiency by adding the third , @xmath276 , term in the expansion that appears to be not included in the original works @xcite .",
    "this term becomes important because larger variation of the potential @xmath41 around the perturber provides the scattered electron with higher local momenta via eq .  .",
    "in fact , we also carried out tests ( not published here ) with only first two terms on the right - hand side of eq .   and the agreement of such fermi s model with the two - particle _",
    "r_-matrixcalculations was very poor .",
    "another simple model worth mentioning here was developed by @xcite .",
    "it is based on a different fermi s pseudopotential @xcite and @xcite utilized it to study broadening of the excited levels of atoms in an alkali - metal atmosphere .",
    "the author solved the schrdinger equationnon - perturbatively using the green s function@xcite and the pecs of the excited bound states @xmath277 were calculated as the solutions of the transcendental equation @xmath278\\mathcal{w}_{\\kappa,1/2}(z)\\mathcal{m}_{\\kappa,1/2}(z)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\              & + & \\left.\\mathcal{w}'_{\\kappa,1/2}(z)\\mathcal{m}'_{\\kappa,1/2}(z)\\right\\},\\label{eq : presnyakov }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath279 , @xmath280 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 are whittaker functions @xcite and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the argument .",

    "are in excellent agreement with the results of the first - order perturbation calculations @xcite , as can be seen in fig .",

    "and the pecs obtained using our two - electron _",
    "r_-matrixapproach for the lower energies is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowstates ] .",
    "both calculations are in very good qualitative agreement .",
    "they agree very well quantitatively at larger internuclear separations and as @xmath0 decreases , the energies of the one - electron model are systematically slightly lower than those obtained from the _ r_-matrixcalculations .",
    "a method for study of long - range rydberg states of diatomic molecules was introduced in this paper .",
    "the method can be viewed as a straightforward extension of the pure one - electron approach of @xcite . in the present work , the two - electron _",
    "r_-matrixmethod is employed to calculate the wave function in the region surrounding one of the atomic cores .",
    "the wave function smoothly connects to a bound - state solution dictated by a long - range coulomb field of the second atomic center .",
    "the approach presented here does not account for a situation in which both electrons leave the first atomic center and thus the ionization energy of the first core defines the upper energy limit of this approach .    in comparison to the method of @xcite",
    ", the present approach brings a few simplifications and some complications .",
    "one of the simplifications is the core potential @xmath40 that can be made independent of the total spin state of the system as well as of the total angular momentum with respect to the first atomic core .",
    "these properties allow calculations for much shorter internuclear distances @xmath0 than those explored by @xcite .",
    "the shorter internuclear separations @xmath0 require higher partial waves with respect to the first center and this requirement raises the demands on the accurate representation of the neutral perturber ( center @xmath31 ) that was considered different for the partial waves @xmath30 and @xmath24 and every total spin state in @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the two - electron method presented here has to deal with the correlated movement of the electrons in the core potential @xmath40 inside a sphere surrounding the atomic core @xmath31 .",
    "such complication may also become a gain in situations , where the energies of the molecular rydberg states associated with the excited states of the perturber are below the ionization threshold of the whole system ( for example , rb@xmath2 ) .",
    "the motivation for the development of the presented method is to study the long - range rydberg states of the alkali - metal diatomics at the internuclear separations @xmath283a.u .",
    ", corresponding to experiments @xcite .",
    "this work aims to complement previous studies @xcite and test the approximation of the contact potential at smaller internuclear distances utilized there to explain the experimental spectra . in order to test the basic mechanisms of the method we decided to test it on the simplest of molecules , h@xmath2 .",
    "present results accurately reproduce previous _",
    "ab initio_calculations @xcite for lower states ( @xmath284 ) and they predict yet undocumented oscillatory character of higher anti - bonding states @xmath237 . while these oscillations are also well reproduced by the two contact - potential models tested in this paper , the absolute energies predicted by the contact - potential models are systematically lower than the more accurate two - particle calculations .",
    "present numerical analysis in the spheroidal coordinates reveals that the physical origin of these oscillations is the same as was explained by @xcite for calculated trilobite states , i.e. the oscillations correspond to the peaks of the dominant spheroidal eigenstates .",
    "our internal numerical tests indicate that the accuracy of the presented energies should be better than 1mev .",
    "therefore , we believe that the present method should bring similar level of accuracy to the characterization of the long - range molecular rydberg states of the alkali - metal molecules .",
    "such studies are planned for the near future .",
    "we are thankful to chris greene for the initial impulse for this work .",
    "we also acknowledge the support of the grant agency of the czech republic ( grant no . p208/14 - 15989p ) .",
    "since the matrix elements of @xmath41 inside the sphere for the first and second electron are equal , only one of them is derived here .",
    "the multipole expansion can be simplified for @xmath285 , @xmath35 as follows : @xmath286 it can be seen from this equation that the matrix elements in the basis can be expressed as a sum of the products of the radial and angular factors .",
    "the angular part can be easily calculated using the algebra of the two - particle irreducible spherical tensors @xcite as    @xmath287    to keep the notation more simple , @xmath67 is not listed as an argument of @xmath288 , since it is a parameter of the calculation fixed at the beginning .",
    "it is obvious from the 3-j and 6-j symbols that these angular factors are non - zero only if all their triangularity conditions are satisfied .",
    "this means that for given @xmath289 , the sum in eq .   is restricted by @xmath290 :    [ eq : selrules ] @xmath291    the multipole radial factors @xmath292 include all four one - electron terms .",
    "these integrals are first numerically evaluated in the @xmath32-splinebasis and then the closed part is transformed using the coefficients @xmath83 in eq .  .",
    "note that none of the angular nor radial factors depend on the internuclear separation @xmath0 . using all these factors , the matrix element in the two - electron basis can be expressed as @xmath293 ,              \\label{eq : offpotel }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "note that the factors @xmath296 with @xmath297 are the overlap integrals between the radial orbitals .",
    "their presence is a direct consequence of the one - electron nature of @xmath41 .",
    "following @xcite , let us start with the definition of the surface harmonics @xmath298 so that the general solutions of the schrdinger equationon the surface @xmath46 can be expressed as @xmath299 in case of the channel expansion , this equation yields @xmath300 where the wave functions @xmath53 are expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics as @xmath301    definition of the surface harmonics and the way how the general solutions on the sphere are expanded in terms of the channels , is to some extent arbitrary .",
    "the definition and employed in this paper is motivated by the symmetry of the problem .",
    "it allows the wave function that was constructed in the @xmath302-coupled representation , to be expressed in terms of the @xmath58-uncoupled representation . to this end , the spherical harmonics @xmath303 and @xmath304 in eq .",
    "are not coupled to form an eigenstate of @xmath63 .",
    "the target part of @xmath305 is constructed using the eigenstates @xmath53 of hamiltonian @xmath52 that includes @xmath306 .",
    "a formulation of the problem with the atomic radial functions @xmath199 instead of the perturbed radial functions @xmath307 in eq .",
    "is also possible and it yields more simple formula for the _ r_-matrixamplitudes @xmath140 .",
    "however , it would lead to additional couplings of @xmath77 by @xmath41 in the projection of the schrdinger equationon @xmath305 in the outer region .",
    "projection of the basis functions onto @xmath305 on the sphere @xmath46 gives @xmath308 where @xmath145 is the volume enclosed by the sphere @xmath46 and @xmath309 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient @xcite .",
    "the only non - zero elements of matrix @xmath310 are those where @xmath311 , since that is the only radial function in the one - particle basis set that does not vanish on the boundary of the inner region .",
    "large internuclear distances @xmath0 , examined in this paper , cause very weak perturbation of the atomic states @xmath312 .",
    "therefore , the overlap integrals in eq .",
    "are close to one for @xmath313 and they rapidly decrease with increasing difference of the indices @xmath314 .",
    "the _ r_-matrixamplitudes in eq .   then can be calculated as @xcite @xmath315 superscript @xmath58 in the notation of the eigenvector @xmath126 denotes the block corresponding to the subset of basis functions @xmath316 with that value of @xmath58 .",
    "substitution of the multipole expansion into the first term of eq .   along with @xmath53 expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics results in @xmath317 where @xmath318 .",
    "the coulomb term @xmath297 is missing due to the second term in eq .  .",

    "this makes the radial integrals that appear in eq .  , and",
    "consequently , all the permanent dipole moment @xmath333 , small .",
    "the polarization effect due to a positively charged atomic core was theoretically studied by @xcite .",
    "their induced dipole moment was parametrized by the static dipole polarizability , distance of the two atomic cores and by a radial cut - off function to eliminate the unphysical singularity at the origin .",
