    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in 1887 , shortly after the publication of maxwell s theory of electromagnetism , experiments performed by h.  hertz clearly demonstrated the free space generation and propagation of electromagnetic waves .",
    "he noticed that sparks ( high frequency electromagnetic waves of the order of 100mhz ) could induce arcing across a wire loop containing a small gap , a few meters away.@xcite    this discovery was anticipated by many people ; p.  s.  munk observed in 1835 the permanent increase of the electrical conductivity of a mixture of metal filings resulting from the passage of a discharge current of a leyden jar.@xcite in 1879 d.  e.  hughes observed a similar phenomenon for a loose contact formed of a carbon rod resting in the grooves in two carbon blocks , and with a tube filled with metallic granules ( a microphone because it was first designed to detect acoustic waves ) .",
    "hughes appears to have discovered the important fact that such a tube was sensitive to electric sparks at a distance as indicated by its sudden change in conductivity . at the time , the royal society of london was not convinced , and his results were published some 20 years later,@xcite a long time after the discovery of hertzian waves . in 1884 t.",
    "calzecchi - onesti performed experiments on the behavior of metallic powders under the action of various electromotive forces , and observed a considerable increase of the powder conductivity by successively opening and closing a circuit containing an induction coil and a tube with fillings.@xcite    the action of nearby electromagnetic waves on metallic powders was observed and extensively studied by branly in 1890.@xcite when metallic filings are loosely arranged between two electrodes in a glass or ebonite tube , it has a very high initial resistance of many megohms due to an oxide layer likely present on the particle surfaces .",
    "when an electric spark was generated at a distance away , the resistance was suddenly reduced to several ohms .",
    "this conductive state remained until the tube was tapped restoring the resistance to its earlier high value . because the electron was not known at this time ( it was discovered in 1897),@xcite branly called his device a `` radio conductor '' to recall that `` the powder conductivity increased under the influence of the electric radiations from the spark ; '' the meaning of the prefix `` radio '' at this time was `` radiant '' or `` radiation . ''",
    "he performed other experiments with various powders , lightly or tightly compressed , and found that the same effect occurred for two metallic beads in contact , and for two slightly oxidized steel or copper wires lying across each other with light pressure.@xcite this loose or imperfect contact was found to be extremely sensitive to a distant electric spark .",
    "this discovery caused a considerable stir when o.  lodge in 1894 repeated and extended hertz s experiments by using a branly tube , a much more sensitive detector than the wire loop used by hertz.@xcite lodge improved the branly tube so that it was a reliable , reproducible detector , and automated it by tapping on the tube with a slight mechanical shock .",
    "lodge called this electromagnetic wave detector a `` coherer '' from the latin _ cohaerere _ , which means `` stick together . ''",
    "he said that the fillings `` coherered '' under the action of the electromagnetic wave and needed to be `` decoherered '' by a shock .",
    "later , branly and lodge focused their fundamental research on mechanisms of powder conductivity , and not on practical applications such as wireless communications . however , based on using the coherer as a wave detector ,",
    "the first wireless telegraphy communications were transmitted in 1895 by g.marconi , and independently by a.  s.popov.@xcite popov also used the coherer to detect atmospheric electrical discharges at a distance .",
    "lodge first hypothesized that the metallic grains were welded together by the action of the voltages that are induced by electromagnetic waves.@xcite according to some including lodge,@xcite the grains became dipoles and attracted each other by electrostatic forces , inducing grains to stick together , thus forming conductive chains .",
    "a shock should be enough to break these fragile chains and to restore the resistance to its original value .",
    "branly did not believe this hypothesis , and to demonstrate that motion of the grains was not necessary , he immersed the particles in wax or resin .",
    "he also used a column of six steel balls or disks , which were a few centimeters in diameter .",
    "because the coherer effect persisted , he thought that the properties of the dielectric between the grains played an important role . in 1900 , guthe et al .",
    "performed similar experiments with two balls in contact.@xcite however , the invention by de forest of the triode in 1906 , the first vacuum tube ( an audion ) , supplanted the coherer as a receiver , and branly s effect sank into oblivion without being fully understood .    in the beginning of the 1960s ,",
    "a group in lille became interested in this old problem .",
    "they suggested that attractive molecular forces keep the particles in contact even after the removal of the applied electrostatic field.@xcite in the 1970s , numerous papers considered the conductivity of granular materials for batteries , but they did not focus on the electrical conduction transition.@xcite in 1975 , a group in grenoble suggested a mechanism of electrical breakdown of the oxide layer on the grain surfaces and investigated the associated @xmath0 resistance noise.@xcite in 1997 , the conduction transition was observed by direct visualization ( with an infrared camera ) of the conduction paths when a very high voltage ( @xmath1v ) was applied to a monolayer of aluminium beads.@xcite more recently , the action at a distance of sparks was investigated.@xcite for additional information about the history of the coherer , see refs .   and .",
    "understanding the electrical conduction transition in granular materials is a complicated problem that depends on many parameters : the statistical distribution of the shape and size of the grains , the applied force , and the local properties at the contact scale of two grains , that is , the degree of oxidization , surface state , and roughness . among the phenomena proposed to explain the coherer effect , it is easy to show that some have only a secondary contribution .",
    "for instance , because the coherer effect was observed by branly with a single contact between two grains,@xcite percolation can not be the dominant mechanism .",
    "moreover , when two beads in contact are connected in series with a battery , a coherer effect is observed at a sufficiently high imposed voltage,@xcite in a way similar to the action at a distance of a spark or an electromagnetic wave .",
    "we will reduce the number of parameters , without loss of generality , by focusing on electrical transport within a chain of metallic beads directly connected to a dc electrical source .",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "it consists of a chain of 50 identical stainless steel beads,@xcite each 8 mm in diameter , and @xmath2 m in roughness .",
    "the beads are surrounded by an insulating medium of polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) .",
    "a static force @xmath3n is applied to the chain of beads by means of a stepper motor , and is measured with a static force sensor .",
    "the number of motor steps is measured with a counter to determine @xmath4 , the total deformation of the chain that is necessary to reach a specific force . during a typical experiment , we supply a current ( @xmath5a ) and simultaneously measure the voltage @xmath6 , and thus the resistance @xmath7 .",
    "similar results have been found by repeating the experiment with an applied voltage and measuring @xmath8 and thus @xmath9 .",
    "the number of beads @xmath10 between the two electrodes is varied from 1 to 41 by moving the electrode beads within the chain . the lowest resistance of the entire chain ( a few ohms ) is always found to be much higher than that of the electrode and the stainless steel bulk material .",
    "the mechanical behavior of the bead chain is found to be in very good agreement with the nonlinear hertz law ( given by linear elasticity ) , that is @xmath11 .",
    "this result leads to an estimate of the typical range of the deformation between two beads as 2 to @xmath12 m , and of the apparent contact radius , @xmath13 , of 40 to @xmath14 m , when @xmath15 ranges from 10 to 500n .    the electrical behavior is much more remarkable than the mechanical one . because no particular precautions were taken for the beads , an insulating film ( oxide or contaminant ) , a few nanometers thick , is likely present at the bead - bead contact .",
    "when the applied current to the chain is increased , we observe a transition from an insulating to a conductive state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] . at",
    "low applied current and fixed force , the voltage - current @xmath6-@xmath8 characteristic is reversible and ohmic ( see arrow @xmath16 in fig .  [ fig02 ] ) with a high , constant resistance , @xmath17 .",
    "this resistance ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) at low current depends in a complex way on the applied force and on the contaminant film properties ( resistivity and thickness ) at the contact location .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is determined by the slope of the @xmath6-@xmath8 plot at low current .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased further , the resistance strongly decreases , corresponding to a bias @xmath20 independent of @xmath8 ( see arrow @xmath21 ) .",
    "as soon as this saturation voltage @xmath20 is reached , the @xmath6-@xmath8 characteristic is irreversible if the current is decreased ( see arrow @xmath22 ) .",
    "the resistance reached at low decreasing current , @xmath23 ( the order of 1@xmath24 ) , depends on the previously applied maximum current , @xmath25 .",
    "note that the nonlinear return trajectory is reversible upon again increasing the current , @xmath8 , and also is symmetrical when the current applied to the chain is reversed ( see arrows 4 and 5 ) . for different applied forces @xmath15 and different values of @xmath25 , we show that the return trajectories depend only on @xmath25 and follow the same reverse trajectory when @xmath6 is plotted versus @xmath26 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath23 are determined by the slopes of the @xmath6-@xmath8 return trajectories at low and decreasing current ( see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "the decrease of the resistance by several orders of magnitude ( from @xmath17 to @xmath23 ) is similar to that of the coherer effect with powders@xcite and with a single contact.@xcite note that after each cycle of the current , the applied force is reduced to zero , and we roll the beads along the chain axis to form new contacts for the next cycle . with this procedure ,",
    "the fall of the resistance ( the coherer or branly effect ) and the saturation voltage are always observed and are very reproducible .",
    "the saturation voltage @xmath20 is independent of the applied force , but depends on the number of beads between the electrodes .",
    "the saturation voltage per contact @xmath27 is found to be constant when the number of beads @xmath10 is varied from 1 to 41 and is on the order of 0.4v per contact . however , this saturation voltage depends slightly on the bead material ( @xmath28v for stainless steel beads , @xmath29v for bronze beads , and 0.3v for brass beads ) , but is of the same order of magnitude.@xcite      assume a mechanical contact between two metallic spheres covered by a thin contaminant film ( @xmath30 few nm ) .",
    "the interface generally consists of a dilute set of microcontacts due to the roughness of the bead surface.@xcite the mean radius , @xmath31 , of these microcontacts is of the order of magnitude of the bead roughness @xmath32 m , which is much smaller than the apparent hertz contact radius @xmath33 m .",
    "figure  [ fig03 ] schematically shows the creation of good electrical contacts by the transformation of this poorly conductive film . at low applied currents ,",
    "the high value of the contact resistance ( k@xmath34m@xmath34 ) probably comes from a complex conduction path found by the electrons through the film within the very small size ( @xmath35 m ) of each microcontact ( see light grey zones in fig .  [ fig03 ] ) .",
    "the electrons damage the film and lead to a `` conductive channel '' : the crowding of the current lines within these microcontacts generates a thermal gradient in their vicinity if significant joule heat is produced .",
    "the mean radius of the microcontacts then strongly increases by several orders of magnitude ( for example , from @xmath36 m to @xmath37 m ) , and thus enhances their conduction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "this increase of the radius is responsible for the nonlinear behavior of the @xmath6-@xmath8 characteristic ( arrow @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) . at high enough current ,",
    "this electro - thermal process can lead to local welding of the microcontacts ( arrow 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) ; the film is thus pierced in a few places where purely metallic contacts ( few @xmath34 ) are created ( see the black zones in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "( note that the current - carrying channels ( bridges ) are a mixture of metal and the film material rather than a pure metal .",
    "it is likely that the coherer action results in only one bridge  the contact resistance is lowered so much that piercing at other points is prevented . )",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath8 characteristic is reversible when @xmath8 is decreased and then increased ( arrow 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the microcontacts have been welded , and therefore their final size does not vary any more for @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath8 reverse trajectory then depends only on the temperature reached in the metallic bridge and no longer depends on the bridge size as for the initial trajectory .",
    "we now check the interpretation in sec .",
    "[ qualitative ] quantitatively .",
    "assume a microcontact between two clean metallic conductors ( thermally insulated at the uniform temperature @xmath40 , with no contaminant or tarnish film on their surfaces ) .",
    "such a clean microcontact is called a  spot . \"",
    "if an electrical current flowing through this spot is enough to produce joule heating ( assumed to be totally dissipated by thermal conduction in the conductors ) , then a steady - state temperature distribution is quickly reached ( @xmath41s ) in the contact vicinity .",
    "the maximum temperature reached , @xmath42 , is located at the contact , and is related to the potential , @xmath43 , at the isotherm , @xmath44 , by the kohlrausch equation@xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath47 is the electrical resistivity of the conductor , both depending on the temperature @xmath44 .",
    "thermal equilibrium means that the heat flux , @xmath48 , across the isothermal surfaces , @xmath49 , is due to the electrical power , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the potential between one of the conductors and the contact ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this thermal equilibrium , @xmath53 , and the current density @xmath54 , thus gives @xmath55 , which leads by integration to eq .",
    "( [ phi - t ] ) .    for many conductors ,",
    "the wiedemann - franz law states that@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57v@xmath58/k@xmath58 is the lorentz constant , @xmath59 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath60 is the electron charge . if we combine eqs .",
    "( [ phi - t ] ) and ( [ wflaw ] ) with @xmath61 , we can express the relation between @xmath42 and the applied voltage , @xmath6 , as @xmath62 equation  ( [ wf ] ) shows that the maximum temperature @xmath42 reached at the contact is independent of the contact geometry and of the materials in contact because both the electrical resistivity , @xmath47 , and the thermal conductivity , @xmath46 , are due to the conduction electrons , which leads to the temperature dependence given by eq .",
    "( [ wflaw ] ) .",
    "a voltage near 0.4v across a contact leads , from eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) and the value of @xmath63 , to a contact temperature near @xmath64c ( @xmath65k ) for a bulk temperature @xmath66c ( @xmath67k ) .",
    "a voltage @xmath680.4v thus leads from eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) to contact temperatures that exceed the melting point of most conducting materials .",
    "efficient metallic bridges are therefore created by microwelding . beyond the quantitative agreement with the experimental saturation voltage @xmath69 ( see sec .  [ results ] and fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) also explains why @xmath69 is the relevant parameter in the experiments in sec .",
    "[ results ] , and not the magnitude of the current .",
    "in addition , when @xmath6 approaches @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) , the local heating of the microcontacts is enough , from eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) , to melt them .",
    "then their contact areas increase , thus leading to a decrease of the local resistance .",
    "when @xmath69 is reached , the microcontacts are welded , thus stabilizing the contact areas , the voltage , and the contact temperatures .",
    "the phenomenon is therefore self - regulated in voltage and temperature .",
    "our quantitative model describes only the electrical behavior of a welded contact , that is , when the saturation voltage is reached .",
    "it describes the reversible @xmath6-@xmath8 reverse trajectory ( when this contact is cooled by decreasing the current from @xmath25 , then eventually reheated by increasing @xmath8 . )",
    "the contact area is assumed to be constant because the contact has been welded , and @xmath39 .",
    "let us derive the analytical expression of the nonlinear @xmath6-@xmath8 reverse trajectory.@xcite we introduce the `` cold '' contact resistance @xmath23 present at currents sufficiently low so as to not cause any appreciable rise in the temperature at the contact .",
    "the bulk conductor is at the room temperature @xmath40 , with an electrical resistivity @xmath70 .",
    "the derivation of @xmath23 involves the same equipotential surfaces during a change between the `` cold '' state ( denoted by a star ) @xmath71 , and the `` hot '' state @xmath51 : the same current thus involves the same current density in both states , and thus @xmath72 .",

    "we could say that our implicit measurement of the maximum temperature ( based on the temperature dependence of the material conductivities ) is equivalent to the use of a resistive thermometer .",
    "electrical phenomena in granular materials related to the electrical conduction transition such as the branly effect have been interpreted in many different ways but without a clear demonstration .",

    "we have shown that the transition triggered by the saturation voltage arises from an electro - thermal coupling in the vicinity of the microcontacts between each bead .",
    "the current flowing through these spots generates local heating which leads to an increase of their contact areas , and thus enhances their conduction . this current - induced temperature rise ( up to @xmath64c ) results in the microwelding of contacts ( even for a voltage as low as 0.4v ) . based on this self - regulated temperature mechanism , an analytical expression for the nonlinear @xmath6-@xmath8 reverse trajectory was derived , and was found to be in good agreement with the data .",
    "the theory also allows for the determination of the microcontact temperature through the reverse trajectory with no adjustable parameters . we could attempt to directly visualize this process with a microscope or infrared camera .",
