    "galactic radio emission is made up from individual sources like supernova remnants ( snrs ) or hii - regions , which are in their majority distributed along the galactic plane and also from diffuse emission originating in the interstellar medium and extending towards high galactic latitudes .",
    "diffuse galactic emission has a large volume filling factor and consists of synchrotron emission and the emission from ionized low density gas .",
    "galactic radio sources are highly concentrated in the thin disk of the galaxy and studies to derive their physical properties in most cases require high angular resolution observations for a wide range of radio frequencies",
    ". polarization observations of synchrotron emitting sources like snrs reveal information about the regularity of the magnetic field , its orientation within the object and also of the ambient interstellar field .",
    "polarized radio emission suffers from faraday rotation within the emitting volume and along the line - of - sight , which again requires multi - frequency observations to solve for that .",
    "all these effects are valid for diffuse emission as well , where the situation may be even more complicated by multiple emission layers along the line of sight , what requires to model the radiation transport conditions in some detail",
    ". studies of the polarized diffuse galactic emission received high interest during the last decade as faraday rotation effects in the interstellar medium are thought to be responsible for a zoo of unusual polarized structures , which have no counterpart in total intensity .",
    "the analysis of polarized emission it is also expected to provide a deeper insight into the composition and structure of the components of the interstellar medium",
    ".    the basis for studies of galactic polarized emission are large - scale surveys .",
    "these are time consuming projects and a number of surveys are actually running or planned to map and to analyse these puzzling phenomena in more detail .",
    "they are believed to provide some key information on galactic magnetic field properties and also on weak thermal emission features .",
    "these investigations in some way complement polarization studies of nearby galaxies , which reveal the magnetic field structures on scales of a few hundred parsec and larger , which are for obvious reasons much more difficult to perform for the milky way .",
    "a high interest in the polarized galactic emission comes from groups aiming to study polarized fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the near future , where the weakness of the effect requires to take the galactic foreground emission and its statistical properties into account .",
    "after the detection of polarized emission from strong radio sources by mayer et al .",
    "[ 1 ] subsequently also polarized emission from the diffuse galactic emission was detected nearly simultaneously by westerhout et al . [ 2 ] and wielebinski et al . [ 3 ] at 408  mhz .",
    "those observations finally established the synchrotron emission process as the major component of the diffuse galactic emission at low radio frequencies .",
    "however , the percentage polarization of these observations was much lower than the theoretical maximum , which is close to 70% for a regular magnetic field .",
    "faraday rotation originating within the interstellar magneto - ionic medium ( mim ) distributed along the line of sight changes the direction of the original polarization angle , which is orientated along the electric field vector and orthogonal to the magnetic field direction .",
    "faraday rotation also causes depolarization , which is rather significant at low frequencies .",
    "due to the technical possibilities during the sixties observations of extended galactic polarization were limited to low frequencies .",
    "furthermore the large beamwidths of low frequency observations reduce the intensity of the observed polarized signal by vector averaging effects ( beam depolarization ) in addition .    following its detection in 1962 systematic surveys of diffuse galactic emission",
    "were carried out for the northern and southern hemispheres . in the northern sky observations at cambridge ( 7.5-m wrzburg riese dish ) by wielebinski & shakeshaft [ 4 ] and at leiden ( dwingeloo 25-m telescope ) by berkhuijsen & brouw [ 5 ]",
    "gave the first insight into the distribution of polarized emission across the sky .",
    "the observing frequency of 408  mhz means a low angular resolution , which is about @xmath0 for the dwingeloo telescope and @xmath1 for the cambridge dish .",
    "southern sky observations by mathewson et al .",
    "[ 6 ] using the parkes 64-m telescope had a higher angular resolution , but were severely undersampled . during the following years polarization surveys",
    "were extended towards higher frequencies , e.g. at 610  mhz by the group in dwingeloo [ 7 , 8 ] and at 1407  mhz by bingham [ 9 ] for the northern sky .",
    "the southern sky was observed at 408  mhz and 620  mhz with some complementary data at 1410  mhz by mathewson et al . [",
    "it is important to note that the definition of the polarized intensity scale differed among the early observations .",
    "berkhuijsen [ 11 ] made a thorough analysis of the scaling of all available polarization surveys at that time and calculated the correction factors relative to the definition adopted by the iau in 1973 , which is based on stokes parameters .",
    "the theory of the synchrotron emission process [ e.g. 12 ] describes the radiation from high energy cosmic - ray electrons in a magnetic field . for a power law distribution of the energy of the cosmic - ray electrons",
    "it can be shown that the observed emission i@xmath2 depends on the number of electrons in the emitting volume @xmath3 , the magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight @xmath4 and the electron energy power law index @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6    thus @xmath5 is directly related to the observed spectral index @xmath7 for observed intensities .",
    "extended emission is the main component of large - scale surveys and is usually quoted in units of brightness temperature t@xmath8 , where the spectral index @xmath9 is related to @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the galaxy hosts large - scale magnetic fields with a typical strength of a few @xmath12 g . relativistic cosmic - ray electrons with typical energies between several hundred mev and a few gev are required for measurable synchrotron emission in the radio range . diffuse galactic synchrotron emission dominates the sky at low frequencies .",
    "it is highly concentrated towards the galactic plane , but also extends to high latitudes .",
    "for instance the high latitude minimum temperatures observed across the sky at 1.4  ghz are around 0.4  k t@xmath13 .",
    "discrete synchrotron emitting sources are mainly identified as the remnants from supernova explosions , which form either expanding shells or diffuse nebula powered by the wind of the neutron star left from the supernova event .",
    "the shells of snrs harbour strong magnetic fields , which were swept up during their expansion .",
    "these shock fronts are commonly considered as the favourable sites for effective cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "after these particle escape the shock they suffer energy losses mainly by synchrotron cooling , but their lifetime is long enough that they may diffuse far out off the plane reaching large heights of a kpc or more .",
    "synchrotron emission is highly polarized .",
    "the degree of polarization p depends on the energy spectral index of the cosmic - ray electrons and calculates to : p = @xmath14 . for typical values of @xmath5 between 2 and 3 the intrinsic percentage polarization",
    "@xmath15 calculates between 69% and 75% .",
    "these values are higher than those observed , which is due to depolarization effects ( see sect .",
    "7.3 ) and also to the degree of regularity of the magnetic field .",
    "the total magnetic field consists of a random ( @xmath16 ) and a regular component ( @xmath17 ) , which give the total field strength @xmath18 . without depolarization the measured degree of polarization",
    "@xmath19 calculates to @xmath20 .",
    "a number of all - sky radio continuum surveys exist in the frequency range up to 1.4  ghz with angular resolutions of @xmath21 at best [ 13 and references therein ] .",
    "figure  1 shows the all - sky 1.4  ghz survey in total intensity .",
    "an additional large - scale survey is available at 2.3  ghz [ 14 ] . at higher frequencies (",
    "up to 10  ghz ) ground based surveys were restricted to the narrow band of the galactic plane , where higher angular resolutions are needed to resolve the complex emission structures ( see sect .",
    "recently new possibilities were opened by high frequency observations from satellites , which complement ground based all - sky surveys limited at a few ghz .",
    "these new all - sky maps are from wmap and cover the frequency range above 22.8  ghz [ 15 ] at angular resolutions of about @xmath22 or better at the higher frequencies .",
    "a summary of early and more recent total intensity surveys was given by wielebinski [ 16 ] .",
    "the absolute calibration of the high frequency data , which were carried out with parabolic antennas , is obtained by comparing the survey maps with low angular resolution sky - horn measurements , which are mostly restricted to scans at fixed declinations . at low frequencies",
    "the galactic sky temperature is so high that an absolute calibration can be done by temperature standards .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse galactic radio emission varies with frequency and sky position . at low frequencies the synchrotron emission clearly dominates , while at higher frequencies the increasing fraction of thermal emission in particular in the galactic plane results in a flattening of the spectra .",
    "synchrotron spectra are also not the same throughout the galaxy , as they depend on the magnetic field strength and the cosmic - ray electron spectra , which are known to steepen towards higher energies . in general flatter spectra",
    "are seen at low frequencies .",
    "there are several methods to obtain information about the global structure of the galactic magnetic field and the local field .",
    "our position inside the galaxy requires models to get its global structure , of course , there is a strong guidance by results obtained for nearby galaxies , which can be studied either as face - on or edge - on objects giving information about the distribution of the disk fields or the field in the halo .",
    "several reviews of the magnetic field structure in nearby normal galaxies are available [ e.g. 21 , 22 ] .",
    "attempts to model the galaxy were made by beuermann et al . [ 23 ] and phillipps et al . [ 24 ] , who deconvolved the 408  mhz all - sky survey of haslam et al . [ 25 ] . at 408",
    "mhz synchrotron emission clearly dominates galactic emission .",
    "the emissivity distribution in the galaxy was obtained by assuming a regular magnetic field along a logarithmic spiral structure .",
    "the ratio of regular to random magnetic field of the best model fit was found to be about unity .",
    "strong et al . [",
    "26 ] used a different method based on comparing @xmath5-ray emissivity with synchrotron emission to get the magnetic field strength as a function of the galacto - centric radius . a steady decrease from the inner galaxy to larger radii was obtained .",
    "the magnetic field strength close to the sun is about 6@xmath12 g .",
    "similar results were derived by berkhuijsen ( private communication , see [ 16 , fig .",
    "14 ] ) assuming equipartition between magnetic field energy and cosmic - ray energy densities using emissivities from the beuermann et al . model .",
    "the direction of the local magnetic field was derived using rotation measures ( rm ) ( see sect .",
    "5.2 ) of pulsars of known distance [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ] .",
    "the direction derived points towards the cygnus region in the northern hemisphere and towards the vela complex in the southern hemisphere , supporting the view of a general orientation of the magnetic field along the spiral arms with a pitch angle of a few degrees .",
    "the regular component of the local magnetic field is about 1.4  @xmath12 g , just a small fraction of the total local field of about 6  @xmath12 g .",
    "also for more distant spiral arms the magnetic field direction can be derived using pulsar rm data .",
    "han et al .",
    "[ 30 ] derived 4.4  @xmath12 g for the regular magnetic field in the inner norma arm , where the total field strength on average is about 10  @xmath12 g [ 26 ] .    of high interest is the existence or non - existence of `` magnetic field reversals '' , which are predicted under certain conditions by the dynamo theory ( see [ 31 ] for a recent review ) . for nearby spiral galaxies indications for field reversals",
    "are very rare [ 21 ] . at present",
    "there is a common agreement on a field reversal between the local orion arm and the sagittarius arm at a distance of a few hundred parsec . for galactic spiral arms at larger distances possibly more field reversals might exist . because of limited data this is discussed controversial .",
    "significantly larger rm data - sets are needed to decide on this important question .",
    "emission from gas clouds being ionized by the photons of ob - stars is referred to as thermal emission .",
    "these hii - regions are also optically visible depending on the amount of extinction by dust . beside discrete gas complexes also",
    "a large amount of diffuse low density gas is present .",
    "hii - regions and diffuse gas are concentrated in the galactic plane with a smaller scale height compared to synchrotron emission . however , sensitive h@xmath10 surveys reveal the existence of thermal gas also far out of the galactic plane .",
    "its excitation is not entirely clear yet .",
    "optically - thin emission spectra , which are seen mostly at frequencies above a few hundred mhz , are flatter than typical synchrotron spectra . for this reason the fraction of thermal emission increases towards higher frequencies .    the dispersion measure ( dm ) from pulsar observations as measured by the time difference of the pulse arrival time at different frequencies",
    "is directly related to the column density of thermal electrons along the line of sight . using independent pulsar distances , e.g. as determined by hi absorption measurements",
    ", the distribution of the thermal electron densities can be derived . on this basis the thermal electron distribution for the galaxy was modeled by taylor and cordes [ 32 ] and cordes and lazio [ 33 ] .",
    "the warm ionized gas has typical temperatures of a few thousand kelvin , but also cold low density thermal gas seems to exists , which preferably surrounds hii - regions as inferred from low - frequency absorption measurements [ e.g. 34 ] or recombination line measurements [ 35 ] .",
    "optical observations indicate an increase of the gas temperature with distance from the galactic plane [ 36 ] , which is also indicated for some edge - on galaxies [ 37 ] .",
    "the coexistence of magnetic fields and thermal gas in the interstellar medium results in faraday rotation .",
    "the amount of faraday rotation also called the faraday depth is ( in the simplest case ) equivalent to the rotation measure ( rm ) , which is defined as the slope of the polarization angle @xmath23 versus @xmath24 , and calculates for a line of sight l [ pc ] :    @xmath25 = 0.81 \\int_l n_{e } [ cm^{-3}]~b_{\\| } [ \\mu g]~dl[pc]\\ ] ]    with @xmath26 being the thermal electron density and @xmath27 the magnetic field component along the line of sight . a detailed discussion of faraday depth related issues was recently made by brentjens and de bruyn [ 38 ] .",
    "rm is positive in case the magnetic field direction points towards the observer and vice versa .",
    "the amount of faraday rotation depends on the observing wavelength , where the observed polarization angle @xmath23 depends on the intrinsic polarization angle @xmath28 and rm by @xmath23 = @xmath28 + rm  @xmath24 .",
    "observations at two frequencies need to be combined to calculate rm .",
    "however , there is an ambiguity in rm , which can be solved by adding observations at a third frequency .",
    "narrow - band polarimetry around a certain frequency is the preferred observing technique as the beams are very similar , depolarization variations are small and therefore the emission originates from the same volume . however , the low signal - to - noise ratio of narrow - band polarimetry may limit the accuracy of the measurements , that small rm differences are not easy to measure . a new method called faraday rotation measure synthesis",
    "was recently introduced [ 38 ] , which allows to analyse contributions from multiple sources along the line of sight and improves the signal - to - noise ratio of narrow - band polarimetry .",
    "an application of this impressive new technique to multi - channel wide - field westerbork polarization images was recently made for observations of the perseus cluster [ 39 ] .    in the case of a uniform mixture of thermal emission and synchrotron emission",
    "the so called slab - model [ 40 ] describes the observed emission as a function of frequency .",
    "however , the distribution of emission components in the interstellar medium is certainly less uniform .",
    "emitting sources with internal and external faraday rotation are observed through the diffuse magneto - ionic medium along the line of sight , where clouds , shells or bubbles with no or very little total intensity emission ( faraday screens ) are embedded .",
    "galactic synchrotron emission is linearly polarized .",
    "this requires to measure the stokes parameter u and q , from which the polarized intensity pi and polarization angle @xmath23 calculate as    @xmath29    @xmath30    early polarization measurements were made with single - dish telescopes using rotating crossed dipoles as feeds . the power difference between the dipoles was measured .",
    "special care must be taken for the antenna pattern ellipticity [ 4 ] .",
    "another method was to measure the cross - correlation between the two feed dipoles [ 2 ] .",
    "there are two possibilities to obtain a set of stokes parameters from correlation . in case the feeds couple out linear polarization stokes parameters i , q and",
    "v are obtained after correlation and a @xmath31 phase shift of one signal .",
    "coupling out two circular polarization components gives stokes i , q and u after correlation , which is the preferred configuration to measure linear polarization needed for galactic polarization work .",
    "the feeds and their adjustment in the telescope are critical components for successful polarization measurements . at low frequencies dipoles are used and at higher frequencies corrugated waveguide feeds .",
    "a number of methods are used to change linear polarization components into circular components and various microwave components are used for this purpose .    figure  [ pol ] shows , as an example , a 8-channel narrow - band if - polarimeter and an additional broad - band channel attached to the l - band receiver at the effelsberg 100-m telescope .",
    "it is used for 1.4  ghz and 1.7  ghz polarization observations and for rm determination . at other telescopes",
    "correlator backends have been installed which allow to measure simultaneously wide bands split into hundreds of narrow channels .",
    "analysis of these polarization data cubes require new techniques as the already mentioned faraday rotation measure synthesis [ 38 ] , for instance . at frequencies of 5  ghz and higher",
    "analog if - polarimeter with a bandwidth of several hundred mhz up to a few  ghz are available for measurements of the usually very weak polarized signals at these frequencies .",
    "this is possible since depolarization across the band becomes less important at high frequencies ( see sect .",
    "7.3 ) .      for polarization measurements a number of instrumental effects must be taken into account .",
    "the antenna feed and other frontend components cause losses or cross - talk between the polarization channels .",
    "the polarimeter response , in addition , may not be circular and the observed u and q signals depend on the polarization angle or the parallactic angle for telescopes with an az - el - mount .",
    "instrumental effects may also vary with time .",
    "all these influences must be calibrated in a suitable way using measurements of unpolarized radio sources and an analysis of the polarized calibration signal to find the instrumental parameters . with the measured instrumental terms a 4x4 correction matrix , the mueller matrix , is set up , which simultaneously transforms the observed polarization components into the four stokes parameters .    .",
    "apparent sky rotation causes a systematic variation of the signals in the u and q-channel of the polarimeter with time ( as indicated ) .",
    "polarimeter offsets and the contribution from the ground are required to be constant during these measurements.,width=302 ]     [ 11 ] .",
    "the polarized intensity spectra are significantly flatter than those of the total intensity synchrotron emission . for the ncp data shown",
    "the spectral index is @xmath9 = -1.8 .",
    "other ncp observations confirm the flat spectrum : @xmath9 = -1.87@xmath32 [ 41 ] or @xmath9 = -2.06@xmath33 [ 42].,width=226 ]    sidelobes caused by strong polarized signals are similar in structure and level compared to the total intensity sidelobes .",
    "an example of a 6  cm polarization pattern is shown in fig .",
    "unpolarized sources often show a butterfly-shaped antenna response for the stokes parameter u and q in the area of the main beam .",
    "this causes a ring - like shaped characteristic for the polarized intensity response of an unpolarized source .",
    "far - sidelobes are highly polarized and this may cause problems in particular for large - scale survey observations .",
    "the sidelobes pick up radiation from the ground and the observed sum of these spurious signals does not vary necessarily in a systematic way . in general ground radiation increases towards lower elevation often",
    "rather different in u and q. an example for ground radiation profiles derived for the villa elisa 1.4  ghz polarization survey of the southern sky is shown in fig .",
    "[ ground ] . depending on the site of the telescope ( e.g. mountains in the surroundings ) the ground radiation may also vary with azimuth direction .",
    "the celestial poles were often used for absolute polarization temperature measurements , because all instrumental contributions are ( in principle ) constant in this direction and by apparent sky rotation the polarization components describe a circle in the u , q - plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ mw - ncp ] , whose radius gives the polarized intensity .",
    "the low frequency spectrum for the north celestial pole is included in fig .",
    "[ elly ] .",
    "the far - sidelobe structure of a telescope depends on the reflecting or scattering support structures within the telescope [ 44 ] .",
    "although the absolute level of the far - sidelobes is rather low ( typically much below -50  db ) day time observations are often affected or become impossible due to scattered solar radiation picked up by the far - sidelobes .",
    "a series of linear polarization surveys of the northern sky between 408  mhz and 1411  mhz were carried out using the 25-m dwingeloo telescope and published in 1976 [ 45 and references therein ] .",
    "all these surveys were on an absolute scale being corrected for the polarized ground radiation and also for faraday rotation occurring in the ionosphere , which needs to be taken into account for frequencies below about 1.4  ghz .",
    "the angular resolution of these surveys varies according to the wide range of frequencies between @xmath0 at 408  mhz and @xmath21 at 1.411  ghz .",
    "the sky was not entirely mapped and the sampling was not complete . however , the data are available in numerical form and were widely used until today . figure  [ dwing ] shows the result of the 1.411  ghz survey in the form of polarization bars in e - field direction .",
    "another series of polarization surveys were carried out with the jodrell bank 76-m telescope . a compilation of all large - scale northern and southern sky galactic surveys published until 1976 is included in the paper by spoelstra [ 46 ] .",
    "more recently several large areas of the sky were mapped with the westerbork telescope at 327  mhz [ 47 - 50 ] and more work is in progress .",
    "these low frequency maps have arcminute angular resolution and reveal a wealth of small - scale polarization structures .",
    "the westerbork observations were recorded in several narrow channels , what allows rm determination .",
    "the results of these observations have been interpreted in a series of papers [ 48 - 55 ] .    as seen from fig .",

    "these basic concepts and formula are most often used in the interpretation of polarized emission . of course , it is rather obvious that more complex scenarios than the uniform distribution of the magneto - ionic components are required to describe recent galactic polarization observations [ 38 ] .",
    "sokoloff et al . [ 87 ] made an attempt in that direction and demonstrate that non - uniform effects have a strong effect on the observed polarization distribution .    burn s slab model [ 40 ] is often used to calculate the _ internal depolarization _ of a source , where thermal electrons , relativistic electrons and magnetic fields are uniformly mixed . then dp calculates as dp = sinc(2  rm  @xmath24 ) . for the case of significant rm fluctuations @xmath67",

    "_ external depolarization _ depends entirely on @xmath67 in the foreground medium : dp = @xmath70 ( for more details see [ 87 ] ) .",
    "excessive faraday rotation in the magneto - ionic interstellar medium may be caused either by an enhanced thermal electron density or by a stronger or more regular magnetic field component along the line of sight .",
    "for example , rm values of extragalactic sources may be enhanced when observed in the direction of a hii - region .",
    "strong magnetic fields are known to exist in the shells of snrs as the result of interstellar magnetic field compression by their expanding shock fronts , which cause a strong increase of the synchrotron emissivity and in most cases also strong linear polarization .",
    "in addition to faraday rotating sources with a clear signature in total intensities , the polarization surveys reveal a class of faraday screens , which are very weak or invisible ( at a certain sensitivity level ) in the corresponding total intensity survey map , but impose clear effects in the polarization angle distribution and/or the polarization intensity distribution . in some cases weak h@xmath71 emission can be seen , but for many faraday screens available h@xmath71 surveys seem not to be sensitive enough to trace them and just allow to derive an upper limit for the thermal electron density .",
    "these faraday screens have a low electron density and thus need an enhanced regular magnetic field along the line of sight direction to account for the observed faraday rotation .",

    "zero - spacings for the other two frequencies were extrapolated with a spectral index of @xmath9 = -2.7 , which is close to the total intensity spectral index .",
    "it was also assumed that rm = 0  rad  m@xmath72 is valid for the diffuse emission in this area ( see fig .",
    "[ rm - titus],[46 ] ) .",
    "these assumptions seem quite reasonable , but also reflect the fact that the availability of absolutely calibrated data and rm information is rather limited .",
    "nine faraday screens were analysed , where the observed rm varies between @xmath73  rad  m@xmath72 and @xmath74  rad  m@xmath72 .",

    "the faraday screen data were then analysed in terms of the model shown in fig .

    "[ cas ] , which imposes more complex although systematic effects on its background emission .",
    "the polarized emission seen towards its centre seems basically undisturbed ( compared to the surroundings of the faraday screen ) , for larger radii first a minimum is seen , followed by a maximum in polarized emission .",
    "this clearly indicates systematic variations of the faraday rotation by some shell like structure , so that the rotated background emission enhances or reduces the observed polarization when added with the foreground .",
    "so far no distance information is available for this faraday screen , which is required to estimate its physical parameters .",
    "a huge magneto - ionic bubble acting as a faraday screen was recently reported by kothes et al . [ 91 ] using for the first time combined polarization data from the drao 26-m telescope , the effelsberg 100-m telescope and the drao synthesis telescope .",
    "the preliminary analysis of this shell in the galactic anti - centre gives a diameter of about 400  pc at a distance of 2  kpc .",
    "a hi - shell coincides with the bubble and locates it in the perseus arm .",

    "the problem when analysing faraday screens from data not at an absolutely calibrated level may be illustrated by the case of g91.8 - 2.5 .",
    "data from the drao synthesis telescope give a @xmath80rm of about 40  rad  m@xmath72 measured around 1.4  ghz [ 92 ] , while rms from effelsberg multi - channel observations in the same frequency range give rm = @xmath81  rad  m@xmath72 [ 93 ] .",

    "vinyajkin s model is able to describe the observed absorption dips at specific frequencies , which are superimposed on the power law spectrum of the polarized emission and complements effects caused by faraday screens . at low frequencies",
    "small rm variations already cause large changes on the polarized structures , while at higher frequencies larger rms as revealed by discrete faraday screens are needed for observable polarization effects .",
    "figure  [ model2 ] shows an example of the influence of a discrete faraday screen on the observed polarized intensities . in this case",
    "the rm of the interstellar medium is assumed to have rm = 0  rad  m@xmath72 along the entire line of sight and thus the faraday screen always causes a depression , whose amount depends on its location within the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the minimum polarized intensity is observed for equal foreground and background emission .",
    "it is easily seen from fig .",
    "[ model2 ] that faraday screens of different rm located at different distances in the interstellar medium are able to create a rather complex distribution of polarized intensities even though the diffuse magneto - ionic interstellar medium has very uniform properties .",
    "it is also evident that at higher frequencies the faraday screens need to have large rms to cause an effect on the polarized distribution .",
    "high frequency polarization observations are needed to reveal the intrinsic properties of the magnetic field distribution in the interstellar medium .",
    "optically thin hii - regions may act as faraday screens by depolarizing their background polarization .",
    "they become optically thick at low frequencies , depending on their electron density and temperature . because their distance can be independently determined , they are ideal objects for galactic tomography. at low frequency the foreground total intensity can be measured as they fully absorb the background emission . at sufficiently high frequencies ( depending on their distance ) the corresponding foreground polarization component is observed .",
    "thus future high angular resolution low frequency observations , as they will become possible with the lofar telescope , when combined with high frequency polarization observations , e.g. from the effelsberg 100-m telescope , will provide detailed information on the magnetic field components within a few kpc and the distribution of the thermal gas components [ 95 ] .",
    "low frequency absorption spectra need some modelling of the components of the thermal gas along the line of sight [ 96 ] .",
    "these results will constrain faraday screen models describing the radiation transfer of polarized emission .",
    "may be the most striking unusual structures in the various new polarization survey maps with sufficiently high angular resolution are long narrow nearly depolarized features commonly named canals. they are for example clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ anti1 ] or fig .",
    "[ anti2 ] .",
    "most of these canals have similar properties : their width is about one beam and the polarization angles change from one side of the canal to the other by @xmath31 .",
    "this requires a gradient for the u and q intensities perpendicular to the canals. at the canal itself u and q become zero .",
    "so far two explanations have been published on the origin of the canals : beam depolarization [ 54 , 55 ] caused by a sufficiently large rm gradient within one beam and faraday depth depolarization [ 97 ] in a uniform synchrotron emitting magneto - ionic medium . in the case of beam depolarization the canals do not change their position with frequency , but at high frequencies canals require very large rm changes across a beam . at 350  mhz a rm gradient across a beam of about 2.1",
    "rad  m@xmath72 is sufficient and no unusual properties of the interstellar medium are needed .",
    "some numerical models of a faraday rotating interstellar medium supports this interpretation of low frequency observations [ 55 ] . at 4.8  ghz ,",
    "however , the rm gradient across a beam width must be 400  rad  m@xmath72 to cause a canal , which seems to be an unrealistic high value for the interstellar medium in general and therefore canals observed at high frequencies most likely need another explanation .",
    "shukurov and berkhuijsen [ 97 ] propose differential faraday rotation as an explanation for the canals : the canals represent level lines of rm . because they are no physical structures they have been called faraday ghosts. the separation of the canals , however , provides useful information on the turbulent interstellar medium .",
    "it must be noted that the discussion of canals above is in all cases based on relative ( synthesis telescope ) rather than absolute polarization data .",
    "shukurov and berkhuijsen [ 97 ] comment on various aspects of that problem .",
    "obviously some conclusions reached for the canals might change when the large - scale polarized emission is available and has been properly taken into account .",
    "rm data from pulsars and extragalactic sources are potentially very valuable for the interpretation of diffuse galactic polarized emission as they trace the entire line of sight component of the galactic magnetic field in a certain direction .",
    "they are thus complementary to the perpendicular component of the magnetic field as seen from synchrotron emission .",
    "however , tomography is needed to reveal information on the magnetic field and the thermal electron density along the line of sight .",
    "figure  [ rm - titus ] illustrates the relation of rms of extragalactic sources in a certain area to the rms measured for the diffuse polarized galactic emission .    in particular rm data from pulsars",
    "are useful to analyse the galactic magnetic field as they provide in principle in combination with the measurable dispersion measure ( dm ) the line of sight magnetic field strength ( however see [ 98 ] for related problems ) . while the rm of a single pulsar is helpful , for instance , to estimate the foreground effect of the interstellar medium towards polarized snrs , fairly large rm samples are needed for a reliable estimate of the local structure , direction and intensity of the magnetic field .",
    "current estimates give a regular magnetic field strength around 1.4  @xmath12 g in the direction of the local arm with a pitch angle of a few degrees [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ] , which is small when compared to the total magnetic field strength ( see sect .",

    "the direction of future observations is towards higher frequencies , where local faraday rotation effects are less important and the galaxy becomes transparent even in the disk .",
    "such measurements require high sensitivity equipment because of the weakness of the polarized signals .",
    "multi - channel polarization observations in numerous narrow bands are another observational direction , which in combination with advanced analysis methods [ 38 ] is quite powerful to decompose complex superimposing polarization structures along the line of sight .",
    "the analysis of the planned l - band rm - survey with the drao 26-m antenna ( see sect .",
    "6.5 ) relies on this technique .",
    "absolutely calibrated polarization data at high frequencies ( above 1.4  ghz ) for large - scale emission is another indispensable need for the proper analysis of polarization data .",
    "unfortunately such data are not easy to obtain at high frequencies .",
    "beside sensitive receivers also a very high stability of the entire receiving system is needed as well as a low level of the telescope s far - sidelobes .",
    "such measurements are time consuming , but can be done with small telescopes .",
    "however , they must be located at well selected suitable sites .",
    "galactic polarization is considered as an important foreground for future sensitive cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization observations .",
    "polarization surveys available in numerical form as the leiden - dwingeloo large - scale survey were analysed in terms of their angular power spectrum by various authors [ 105 and references therein ] .",
    "also the new large - scale polarization surveys are actually analysed in a similar way [ 106 ] .",
    "of course , also for the various recent galactic plane surveys with higher angular resolution the angular power spectrum is available although they are more influenced by faraday effects than high latitude regions [ 107 and references therein ] .",
    "a problem with available galactic polarization data are their low frequencies and the influence of faraday effects when compared to the much higher frequencies , where cmb observations are carried out .",
    "source contamination of the angular power spectrum turns out to be severe , depolarization effects vary with frequency and only at high galactic latitudes one can be sure to look out off the galaxy . thus extrapolations towards higher frequencies are not easy to perform with high accuracy , but upper limits can be given with confidence .",
    "high frequency observations above 1.4  ghz are needed .",
    "2.7  ghz and 5  ghz observations are already on the way , which may better constrain foreground predictions at cmb frequencies in general than it is possible with available data .",
    "however , recent results for selected fields with low synchrotron and dust emission are promising .",
    "cmb polarization ( cmbp ) is usually expressed in terms of e- and b - modes [ e.g. 108 ] , where the e - mode is at a few percent of the cmb anisotropies , but the level of the much weaker b - mode is largely unknown .",
    "however , the b - mode is needed to disentangle different inflation models [ 109 ] .",
    "sensitive observations of a northern and southern target selected for cmb polarization ( cmbp ) observations [ 110 ] by the bar - sport experiment [ 111 ] were recently carried out .",
    "1.4  ghz observations with the effelsberg 100-m telescope of the northern bar - sport field , which is at very high galactic latitude , reveals the lowest contamination by polarized galactic foreground emission measured so far .",
    "this implies good chances to detect b - mode emission at about 90  ghz [ 112 ] .",
    "more extended searches may reveal areas with are suited to detect even weaker b - mode signals .",
    "therefore the polarized galactic synchrotron foreground seems not to be a limitation to detect weak cmbp signals at least on scales up to a few degrees in extent .",
    "i like to thank ernst frst and patricia reich for sharing common efforts over many years on galactic survey projects and their critical comments on the manuscript .",
    "i acknowledge discussions and cooperation with roy duncan , jinlin han , roland kothes , tom landecker and rob reid on polarization survey issues .",
    "i am grateful to richard wielebinski for initiating and strongly supporting the various mpifr survey projects over the last 30  years . without his engagement",
    "the new 5  ghz polarization surveys would not been possible .",
    "former phd - students made significant contributions to the different survey projects at the mpifr in bonn : norbert junkes , juan carlos testori , buelent uyaniker and maik wolleben .",
    "helpful discussions with rainer beck on the manuscript are acknowledged too .",

    "<S> faraday screens were reported , which clearly indicate that faraday rotation in the magneto - ionic medium may largely vary on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> these findings called for a systematic approach and a number of new unbiased polarization surveys were started . </S>",
    "<S> also new attempts for absolute calibration are under way , which is a critical issue when interpreting polarization structures . </S>",
    "<S> this paper reviews polarization survey projects and also summarizes recent results and interpretations of this rather active field of research . </S>"
