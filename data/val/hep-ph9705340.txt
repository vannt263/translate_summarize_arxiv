    "considerable effort has been invested in understanding the higgs sector of the standard model .",
    "reliable constraints on the higgs boson mass are important in determining the energy scales for collider experiments that probe the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "alternately , should the higgs be discovered , its properties will help elucidate high - scale physics .",
    "( see@xcite for an early review ) . in the standard model",
    "the requirement that the conventional effective potential @xmath0 have its global minimum at the electroweak scale has been used to obtain a relation between a lower bound on the mass of the higgs boson and the scale at which new physics should appear ( for recent reviews see@xcite ) .",
    "that scale is related to the value of @xmath1 ( expectation value of the higgs field ) at which @xmath2 develops a new deeper minimum ( which depends on the mass of the higgs ) .",
    "recently loinaz and willey@xcite have pointed out a difficulty with this procedure . when the contributions from the gauge sector of the electroweak theory are included in the effective potential ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 which minimizes @xmath2 is _ gauge dependent_. the gauge dependence of the effective potential was already recognized by dolan and jackiw in their early formulation of effective potentials@xcite .",
    "although in some specific gauges the contribution of the gauge sector may be a perturbative correction to the contributions from the scalar plus heavy ( top ) fermion - yukawa sector , the gauge dependence implies that no error estimate can be made and raises questions on the reliability of such bounds .",
    "the conventional @xmath2 , defined in terms of 1pi green s functions at zero momentum is an off - shell quantity and in a gauge - fixed formulation is inherently gauge variant and therefore not uniquely defined . using the effective potential to study stability or metastability",
    "implicitly assumes that @xmath2 is associated with the energy of ( space - time constant ) field configurations . in scalar field theories",
    "the effective potential is proven to be the energy of a constrained state@xcite , but such proof is lacking in gauge theories .",
    "since the effective potential as calculated in gauge - fixed formulations is explicitly gauge dependent , it can not generally be identified with the expectation value of the physical hamiltonian in a physical state .",
    "there are , however , gauge independent quantities that _ can _ be extracted from the effective potential .",
    "nielsen identities@xcite have been used to prove that the _ difference _ of the values of the ( gauge fixed ) effective potential evaluated at extrema are gauge invariant , as well as the nucleation rate for bubbles in a first order transition when calculated from the effective potential@xcite . however providing a lower bound on the higgs mass requires to estimate values of the expectation value of the scalar order parameter , which is a _ gauge variant _ quantity even at the minima of the effective potential .",
    "thus it is important to provide a formulation in which the effective potential is a gauge invariant function of a gauge invariant order parameter and can be interpreted as an energy function .",
    "there have been efforts to formulate a gauge invariant effective action@xcite and consequently an effective potential , but the formalism involved is formidable and its calculational implementability rather unwieldy .    recently a formulation that allows to obtain a gauge invariant effective potential as the expectation value of the hamiltonian in physical states has been developed within a different framework@xcite .",
    "we refer to this as the physical effective potential ( pep ) . in this article",
    "we apply the formulation proposed in@xcite to solve the problem of the gauge dependence in a slight variant of the model studied in@xcite .",
    "although this model is a simplified abelian version of the standard model , it serves to demonstrate the utility of the gauge - invariant effective potential in providing a gauge - invariant estimate of a vacuum instability scale .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section ii we present the model to be studied and the relevant aspects of the gauge invariant formulation provided in@xcite and adapted to include the fermionic sector . in this section we define the physical ( gauge invariant ) observables including the order parameter that provides an unambiguous signal for symmetry breaking . in section iii",
    "we explicitly construct the one loop effective potential as the expectation value of the physical hamiltonian in gauge invariant states constrained to give a space - time constant expectation value of the gauge invariant order parameter .",
    "we also provide the @xmath3 renormalization of this effective potential . in section",
    "iv we compare our results to those obtained from the gauge fixed formulation in general @xmath4 gauges .",
    "section v is devoted to a rg improvement of the gauge invariant effective potential and to an unambiguous determination of the lower bound on the higgs mass in this model , providing `` error estimates '' for the quantities obtained in the gauge variant formulation . in section",
    "vi we present some brief numerical results .",

    "the definition of the effective potential that we use is in terms of the expectation value of the physical hamiltonian in physical states constrained to provide a fixed expectation value of the physical order parameter .",
    "the program for the construction of such an effective potential requires i ) the identification of the physical ( gauge invariant ) states of the theory , ii ) the identification of an order parameter that is invariant under the _ local _ gauge transformation but transforms nontrivially under the rigid global symmetry transformation and thus gives information on spontaneous symmetry breaking iii ) construction of the gauge invariant effective potential as the expectation value of the hamiltonian in constrained physical states . since the concepts behind the construction are not part of the standard lore , we highlight below the most relevant aspects of the formulation , for more details see@xcite .",

    "there is a definite advantage in this gauge invariant formulation : the ( composite ) field @xmath31 is a candidate for a _ locally gauge invariant order parameter_. the point to stress is the following : this operator is _ invariant _ under local gauge transformations but it transforms as a charged operator under the _ global _ gauge transformations generated by @xmath32 , that is @xmath33    because the gauge constraints annihilate the physical states and these constraints are the generators of local gauge transformations@xcite , these states are invariant under the local gauge transformations and any operator that _ is not _",

    "the field @xmath35 fulfills these criteria and is the natural candidate for an order parameter .    at this stage , having recognized the physical states one could prefer to pass to a path integral representation of the vacuum - in to vacuum - out transition amplitude .",

    "there is no need for `` gauge fixing '' . in the resulting action ( of the form @xmath37 ) , the instantaneous coulomb interaction can be re - written by introducing an auxiliary field , and the integral over the canonical momenta can be carried out explicitly leading to a lagrangian form .",
    "the resulting lagrangian leads to feynman rules that are very similar to those in coulomb gauge and allow the perturbative calculation of wave function renormalization constants needed below .",
    "the gauge invariant effective potential can also be computed in this path integral representation , but we prefer to provide its explicit construction from the hamiltonian as such construction displays more clearly the identification of the effective potential as the energy of a constrained state .",

    "we note that the similarities of the numerical results between the pep and the landau gauge fixed effective potential are not obvious _ a priori_. in a gauge fixed formulation there is _ a priori _ no reason to expect the results in one gauge to be numerically superior to those in another gauge .    the similarities between the numerical results on the scale of new physics and therefore on the bound on the higgs mass between the gauge invariant and gauge fixed formulation is due to the fact that the gauge couplings considered are relatively weak . for stronger coupling",
    "the gauge and scalar sectors will be more important in @xmath129 and the differences more noticeable .",
