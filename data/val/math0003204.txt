    "in @xcite d. mumford introduced the notion of a categorical quotient for the action of an algebraic group @xmath0 on an algebraic variety @xmath1 . by definition",
    "this is a @xmath0invariant morphism @xmath2 such that every @xmath0invariant morphism from @xmath1 to some algebraic variety factors uniquely through @xmath3 . in general , such a categorical quotient need not exist . in this article",
    "we will consider subtorus actions on complex toric varieties .    in this setting ,",
    "a natural candidate for a categorical quotient has been constructed in the category of toric varieties , namely the so  called _ toric quotient _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the toric quotient is universal for toric morphisms from the given toric variety that are constant on the orbits of the subtorus action . clearly , a necessary condition for the toric quotient to be categorical is surjectivity .",
    "but there are examples of toric quotients that are not surjective and hence not categorical .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , section  5 , an example of a subtorus action on a toric variety is given that does not admit a categorical quotient , not even in the category of algebraic or analytic spaces .",
    "on the other hand , if the codimension of @xmath4 in the big torus @xmath5 of the toric variety is at most @xmath6 , then the toric quotient is always categorical ( corollary 4.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "an important tool for the proof was to observe that the toric quotient in that case is _ weakly proper _ , i.e.  it satisfies a certain weak lifting property for holomorphic germs of curves ( the precise definition is given in section  1 ) .    a morphism of complex algebraic varieties is weakly proper if and only if it is universally submersive .",
    "another more geometric characterization is given by the following notion : we say that a morphism @xmath2 of algebraic varieties satisfies the _ curve covering property _",
    "if for every curve @xmath7 there is a ( not necessarily irreducible ) curve @xmath8 with @xmath9 , such that the morphism from @xmath10 to @xmath11 defined by @xmath3 has finite fibers .",
    "if in addition the curve covering property is preserved under any base change , then the morphism @xmath3 has the _ universal curve covering property_. if @xmath3 is a surjective morphism over the field of complex numbers then this property is equivalent to weak properness ( see section  1 ) .    for a toric morphism ,",
    "weak properness has a very simple characterization in terms of fans , namely the property holds if and only if the associated lattice homomorphism induces a surjective map on the supports of the corresponding fans ( see section  2 ) .    in this article",
    "we will show that weak properness is a sufficient condition for a toric quotient of expected dimension to be categorical .",
    "more precisely , our main result is the following ( see corollary [ hauptergebnis ] ) :    theorem .",
    "_ for a toric variety @xmath1 and a subtorus @xmath4 of the big torus @xmath5 of @xmath1 , let @xmath2 denote the toric quotient for the action of @xmath4 on @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath3 is weakly proper and @xmath12 , then the toric quotient is categorical . _    for example , weak properness is automatically satisfied if the fan associated to @xmath1 has a convex support , or equivalently , if there is a proper toric morphism from @xmath1 onto an affine toric variety .",
    "in fact , we can even show that in this case the dimension condition can be omitted ( see corollary [ convex case ] ) :    theorem .",
    "_ if the toric variety @xmath1 corresponds to a fan with convex support , then for any subtorus action on @xmath1 the toric quotient is a quotient in the category of algebraic varieties . _    in order to prove our results we proceed by induction on the number of steps occuring in the construction of the toric quotient .",
    "the intermediate steps of this construction can be viewed as successive approximations of the quotient by non - separated prevarieties ( see section  6 ) .",
    "therefore it simplifies the arguments to work in the more general context of toric prevarieties .",
    "we prove a result stated in this context ( see theorem  [ weakly proper toric quotient ] ) and obtain the above theorems as corollaries .",
    "toric prevarieties are the non  separated analogues of toric varieties , i.e.  complex algebraic prevarieties with an effective action of a torus having a dense orbit . in analogy to the separated case , there is a convex ",
    "geometrical description of toric prevarieties in terms of so  called _ systems of fans _",
    "( see @xcite ) . in section  2",
    "we briefly recall the basic facts on toric prevarieties and systems of fans .",
    "in section  3 we consider morphisms from toric prevarieties to algebraic varieties that are not necessarily toric .",
    "every such morphism defines an equivalence relation on the cones occuring in the system of fans corresponding to the toric prevariety , and the supports of the equivalence classes form a partition of the support of the system of fans .",
    "the properties of this partition are analyzed in section  4 and  5 .",
    "these sections contain the convex ",
    "geometrical lemmata that are needed for the proof of the main theorem that is carried out in section  6 .    as an application of the result , in section  7 we give an example of a categorical quotient @xmath2 of a @xmath13dimensional toric variety by some @xmath14action where @xmath15 that is not uniform in the sense of @xcite , i.e. such that for some open subset @xmath16 , the restriction @xmath17 is not the categorical quotient for the induced @xmath14action .",
    "in this section we recall the definition of weak properness given in @xcite , and we give another interpretation of this notion in terms of a certain curve covering property .",
    "we start with the curve covering property , and we first consider algebraic prevarieties defined over an arbitrary algebraically closed field @xmath18 . following the terminology used e.g.  in @xcite , we do not require a prevariety to be irreducible .",
    "when we speak of a curve in a prevariety we mean a closed algebraic subset of pure dimension @xmath19 .",
    "so a curve in this sense is also not necessarily irreducible .",
    "let @xmath20 be a morphism of prevarieties .",
    "we say that @xmath3 satisfies the _ curve covering property _",
    "( ccp ) if for every irreducible curve @xmath7 and every @xmath21 there is an irreducible curve @xmath8 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 is dense in @xmath11 .",
    "if the curve covering property remains true even after any base change then we say that @xmath3 satisfies the _ universal curve covering property_.    every surjective proper morphism of prevarieties satisfies the universal curve covering property .",
    "let @xmath2 be a proper surjective morphism .",
    "consider an irreducible curve @xmath11 in @xmath24 and a point @xmath21 .",
    "choose an irreducible curve @xmath10 in @xmath1 such that @xmath23 is dense in @xmath11 . since @xmath3 is proper , the curve @xmath10 must intersect the fiber of @xmath25 .    in fact , the curve covering property is nothing but a geometric characterization of submersiveness :    [ ccp = submersiv ] a surjective morphism @xmath2 of algebraic prevarieties satisfies the curve covering property if and only if it is submersive , i.e. if @xmath24 carries the quotient topology with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "first suppose that the ( ccp ) holds , and consider a subset @xmath16 whose preimage @xmath26 is open in @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that the complement @xmath27 is not closed and choose a point @xmath28 . since @xmath29 is constructible , there is an irreducible curve @xmath30 through @xmath25 such that @xmath31 is open and dense in @xmath32 . using the ( ccp ) we can find an irreducible curve @xmath33 meeting the fiber @xmath34 in a point @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is dense in @xmath32 .",
    "that implies @xmath37 contradicting the assumption that @xmath38 is closed .",
    "conversely suppose that @xmath3 is submersive and consider an irreducible curve @xmath32 through a point @xmath25 in @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath3 is surjective , the fiber of @xmath25 is not empty .",
    "moreover , since @xmath39 is not closed , the assumption implies that its preimage @xmath40 is also not closed .",
    "so there is a point @xmath35 in the fiber of @xmath25 which is contained in the closure of @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that there is a curve @xmath42 through @xmath35 in @xmath43 intersecting the fiber of @xmath25 only in a finite number of points .",
    "so the ( ccp ) is fulfilled .",
    "an example of a surjective morphism that does not satisfy the curve covering property is the following :    let @xmath1 denote the blow  up of @xmath44 in the origin , and let @xmath45 be the point corresponding to the @xmath46axis in the exceptional line . then the morphism @xmath47 defined by contracting the exceptional line is surjective .",
    "but there is no curve in @xmath48 covering the @xmath46axis near the origin .",
    "here is an example of a surjective morphism with curve covering property but such that the ( ccp ) does not hold universally .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the simple nodal curve in @xmath44 defined by the equation @xmath49 .",
    "its normalization is given by @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the map @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 is surjective and the ( ccp ) holds . but",
    "base change of @xmath3 via @xmath53 leads to a map that does not have the ( ccp ) :    the fiber product of @xmath54 and @xmath55 over @xmath1 is the reducible subvariety @xmath56 of @xmath44 , and for the projection @xmath57 onto the first factor the ( ccp ) does not hold .    from now on let us assume that all prevarieties are defined over @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the universal curve covering property has a local interpretation in terms of holomorphic germs of curves , and for this purpose we recall some definitions from @xcite",
    ". a _ local curve _ in @xmath59 is defined to be a holomorphic mapping germ @xmath60 where @xmath10 is an algebraic curve in @xmath1 through @xmath35 .",

    "we say that a local curve @xmath61 in @xmath59 is a _",
    "weak @xmath3lifting _ of a local curve @xmath62 in @xmath63 ( where @xmath7 is a curve through @xmath25 ) if there is a non  constant holomorphic mapping germ @xmath64 and a commutative diagram @xmath65^{\\t{\\gamma } } \\ar[d]_{\\alpha } &   x'_{x } \\ar[d]^{p } \\cr   \\cc_{0 } \\ar[r]^{\\gamma } & y'_{y } } \\ ] ] the map @xmath3 is called _ weakly proper _ , if any local curve in @xmath24 admits a weak @xmath3lifting . a similar notion in the context of algebraic spaces",
    "was introduced by kollr , the so - called weak lifting property for discrete valuation rings ( see @xcite , section  3 ) .    for a surjective morphism @xmath2 of complex algebraic prevarieties",
    "the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 is weakly proper .",
    "@xmath3 has the universal curve covering property .",
    "@xmath3 is submersive , and this property is preserved by every base change .",
    "first note that surjectivity is preserved under base change .",
    "so the equivalence of the last two statements follows from the lemma  [ ccp = submersiv ] .",
    "moreover , note that weak properness is preserved under base change and clearly implies the ( ccp ) .",
    "that shows that ( i ) implies ( ii ) .",
    "now let us assume ( ii ) and conclude ( i ) .",
    "without loss of generality we can also assume that @xmath24 is separated .",
    "let @xmath66 be a local curve through a point @xmath67 , let @xmath32 denote the zariski closure of the image of @xmath66 in @xmath24 .",
    "the local curve @xmath66 factors through the normalization @xmath68 , and after a base change we can achieve that @xmath24 is normal and @xmath19-dimensional .    by assumption there is a point @xmath35 in the fiber of @xmath25 and an irreducible curve @xmath42 through @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is dense in @xmath24 . consider the normalization @xmath69 of @xmath42 , and choose a point @xmath70 above @xmath35 .",
    "we have an induced dominant morphism from @xmath69 to @xmath24 mapping @xmath71 to @xmath25 .",
    "now we can argue locally in the analytic category .",
    "the germs @xmath72 and @xmath73 are smooth and hence isomorphic to @xmath74 .",
    "the holomorphic germ of the morphism @xmath3 looks like the germ @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 for some @xmath77 , and similarly the germ of @xmath66 is of the form @xmath78 , @xmath79 for some @xmath80 .",
    "since both germs commute , one can choose @xmath81 and @xmath82 to obtain the desired commutative diagram .",
    "so in fact ( i ) holds .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we want to further investigate weakly proper toric quotients . the main task will be to check the defining property of a categorical quotient . in this context",
    "the following factorization result is particularly useful ( see proposition 1.1 in @xcite ) :    [ factmor ] let @xmath20 be a weakly proper morphism of prevarieties , assume that @xmath24 is normal and let @xmath83 be a morphism into a variety @xmath84 . if @xmath85 is constant on the fibres of @xmath3 , then there is a unique morphism @xmath86 such that @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88    note that for open surjections the above result is well  known ( see e.g. @xcite , ii.6.2 ) .",
    "however , the statement is not true in general for arbitrary morphisms  @xmath3 .",
    "we now come to the toric setting .",
    "since for the proof of our main result we need the non - separated analogues of toric varieties , here we first briefly summarize the basic facts about toric prevarieties .",
    "then we state the characterization of weak properness in terms of fans .    by definition a _",
    "toric prevariety _ is a normal prevariety together with an effective action of an algebraic torus having a dense orbit .",
    "we also fix an embedding of the torus @xmath5 in the toric prevariety @xmath1 and denote the point in @xmath1 corresponding to the identity element by @xmath89 . a morphism @xmath90 of toric prevarieties with tori @xmath5 and @xmath91 respectively is called a toric morphism if @xmath85 maps @xmath5 into @xmath91 and is equivariant with respect to the actions of @xmath5 and @xmath91 respectively . in particular ,",
    "the restriction map @xmath92 is a group homomorphism , and we will refer to its kernel as the _ kernel of @xmath85 _ and denote it by @xmath93 .    as in the separated case , one can associate to each toric prevariety a convex  geometrical object .",
    "more precisely , the category of toric prevarieties is equivalent to the category of affine systems of fans ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall the basic definitions .",
    "system of fans _ in a lattice @xmath94 is a finite collection @xmath95 of fans @xmath96 in the lattice @xmath94 with @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .",
    "such a system of fans is called _ affine _ if for every @xmath99 the fan @xmath100 consists of the faces of a single cone @xmath101 in @xmath94 .",
    "given an affine system of fans @xmath102 in a lattice @xmath94 , one can construct a toric prevariety @xmath103 with torus @xmath104 by taking the affine toric varieties @xmath105 associated to the cones @xmath101 in the lattice @xmath94 , and glueing @xmath105 and @xmath106 along the open toric subvariety corresponding to the common subfan @xmath96 of @xmath100 and @xmath107 for every @xmath108 .",
    "the subfans @xmath96 induce a glueing relation on the set @xmath109 of labelled faces of the maximal cones occuring in @xmath102 , namely @xmath110 if and only if @xmath111 .",
    "there is a @xmath19@xmath19correspondence between the set of equivalence classes @xmath112 and the set of @xmath5orbits in @xmath103 .",
    "more precisely , every labelled face @xmath113 defines a distinguished point @xmath114 in the toric variety @xmath105 , and this point is identified with @xmath114 in @xmath106 if and only if @xmath115 .",
    "therefore every equivalence class @xmath116\\in\\omega(\\s)$ ] defines a distinguished point @xmath117}$ ] in @xmath103 , and the orbits @xmath118}$ ] , @xmath116\\in\\omega(\\s)$ ] , form a partition of @xmath103 .",
    "the orbit structure is reflected by the partial ordering on @xmath119 given by @xmath120\\prec[\\sigma , i]$ ] if and only if @xmath121 and @xmath120=[\\tau , i]$ ] .",

    "however , it will suffice to consider toric morphisms from prevarieties to varieties .",
    "so let @xmath103 be the toric prevariety arising from an affine system of fans @xmath102 in a lattice @xmath94 and let @xmath123 denote the toric variety associated to a fan @xmath124 in a lattice @xmath125 .",

    "so if @xmath3 is weakly proper , then by proposition  [ weakpropchar ] , we have @xmath552 , and theorem  [ weakly proper toric quotient ] applies .",
    "[ convex case ] let @xmath1 be a toric variety corresponding to a fan with convex support .",

    "now we come to the proof of the main theorem .",
    "proof of theorem 6.2 .",
    "first we can reduce the situation to a special case .",
    "let us denote by @xmath553 the largest subtorus of @xmath5 such that every @xmath4invariant morphism from @xmath1 to some variety is in fact @xmath553invariant . then in particular",
    ", the separated toric quotient @xmath521 is @xmath553invariant , and that means that @xmath554 . here as before @xmath555 denotes the kernel of the homomorphism of tori induced by @xmath521 .",
    "note that the separated toric quotients with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath553 coincide .",
    "moreover , the assumption @xmath531 , implies that @xmath556 , where @xmath557 denotes the projection modulo the lattice @xmath558 corresponding to @xmath553 and @xmath559 the projection with @xmath560 .",
    "so for this proof we can assume w.l.o.g .",
    "that @xmath561 .",
    "we claim that moreover we can assume @xmath562 or equivalently @xmath563 . to see this let @xmath223 be an @xmath4-invariant morphism to some variety @xmath84 .",
    "consider the algebraic quotients of the affine charts @xmath564 . since any good quotient is categorical , the restriction of @xmath85 to @xmath565 factors uniquely through @xmath566 .",
    "therefore we obtain morphisms @xmath567 with @xmath568 .    in particular ,",
    "@xmath85 is @xmath569invariant for every @xmath319 , and therefore by assumption @xmath570 for all @xmath319 .",
    "that means that @xmath571 is the affine toric variety defined by the cone @xmath572 in @xmath573 , and all the cones @xmath574 are strictly convex .",
    "if we glue all the affine charts @xmath575 along the open orbit @xmath576 , we obtain a toric prevariety @xmath10 that in some sense is a first non - separated approximation of the quotient variety @xmath123 .",
    "the prevariety @xmath10 corresponds to the system of fans @xmath577 in @xmath125 , where @xmath578 is the fan of faces of @xmath574 and @xmath579 for all @xmath580 .",
    "we can view the quotient fan @xmath124 of @xmath135 by @xmath522 as the quotient fan of @xmath581 by the zero lattice .",

    "in this case the condition in theorem  [ weakly proper toric quotient ] says that @xmath591 .",
    "let @xmath223 be a morphism to a variety .",
    "let us have a closer look at the algorithmic construction of the quotient fan @xmath124 of @xmath415 by the zero lattice .",
    "the first set @xmath533 simply consists of the maximal cones in @xmath415 .",
    "let @xmath592 denote the toric prevariety obtained from the maximal affine charts of @xmath103 , but now only glued along the open orbit .",
    "the identity on the affine charts induces a toric morphism @xmath593 .",
    "set @xmath594 .",
    "by induction on the index @xmath595 counting the steps in the algorithm we now prove the following for @xmath535 :    1 .",
    "all the cones in @xmath596 are strictly convex .",
    "hence we may define a toric prevariety @xmath597 from the affine toric varieties corresponding to the cones in @xmath596 by glueing them along the open orbit @xmath5 .",
    "there is a morphism @xmath598 such that we have a commutative diagram @xmath599^{f_{l-1 } } \\ar[d]_{p_l } & \\ z \\cr x_{l } \\ar[ur]_{f_l } & \\cr } \\qquad,\\ ] ] where @xmath600 denotes the toric morphism induced by the identity on @xmath94 .",
    "so let @xmath535 , and assume that the induction hypothesis is fulfilled for all previous steps .",
    "suppose that @xmath596 was obtained from @xmath601 by replacing a cone @xmath602 by @xmath603 , where @xmath604 such that @xmath605 .",
    "then in particular , @xmath606 .",
    "let @xmath607 denote the system of fans associated to @xmath597 . by the general assumption , @xmath608 and hence @xmath609 . since we assumed that @xmath610 , we can apply proposition [ kegelvergroesserung ] to @xmath611 to conclude that @xmath612 .",
    "so by proposition [ kegelabschluss ] , the relative interior of any face of @xmath613 is contained in some @xmath614equivalence class .",
    "if @xmath613 would contain a linear subspace , then this would imply that @xmath614 for any choice of @xmath85 would be invariant with respect to the corresponding subtorus , and that contradicts the assumption that @xmath610 .",
    "therefore in fact @xmath613 must be strictly convex , and @xmath614 by corollary [ indmor ] defines a morphism on @xmath615 .",
    "hence we can extend @xmath614 to a morphism @xmath616 as desired .",
    "this proves the induction claims ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "it remains to show that the morphism @xmath617 corresponding to the last step of the loop , factors through the quotient variety @xmath123 .",
    "as we have just seen , in our special case the cones in @xmath543 are strictly convex .",
    "therefore @xmath543 is in fact the set of maximal cones of the quotient fan @xmath124 .",
    "the toric prevariety @xmath618 is obtained from the affine charts @xmath619 , where @xmath620 , by glueing them along the open orbit @xmath5 .",
    "the morphism @xmath617 induces morphisms @xmath621 that coincide on the open dense orbit @xmath5 .",
    "we can also view the @xmath619 as affine charts of @xmath123 .",
    "but in this variety for any pair @xmath622 , the charts @xmath619 and @xmath623 are glued along the common subset @xmath624 . since @xmath84 is separated , and the morphisms @xmath625 and @xmath626 agree on the open dense orbit , they even agree on @xmath624 .",
    "so they fit together to a morphism @xmath627 and @xmath628 , where @xmath629 is the toric morphism induced by the identity on @xmath94 .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "we also obtain as a corollary the following statement about actions of subtori of small codimension that was proved in @xcite as theorem 4.1 .",
    "[ codim2pre ] let @xmath630 be a subtorus of codimension @xmath631 .",
    "then for any separated toric quotient of a toric prevariety with big torus @xmath5 with respect to @xmath4 the universal property  ( ca ) holds .",
    "proof of proposition [ codim2pre ] .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the separated toric quotient of a toric prevariety @xmath1 by @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath632 , then the conditions of theorem [ weakly proper toric quotient ] are automatically satisfied for @xmath3 , and therefore the universal property  ( ca ) holds .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath633 .",
    "then the projections of the maximal cones of @xmath124 in @xmath528 are at most @xmath6dimensional , and therefore the convex hull of two overlapping projections either equals their union or equals the whole plane @xmath634 .",
    "so if the variety @xmath24 is @xmath6dimensional , then the algorithm for constructing the quotient fan shows that here @xmath3 also automatically satisfies the conditions of the theorem .    if @xmath635 , then among the cones of the given toric prevariety @xmath140 there must be a chain of cones @xmath636 such that @xmath637 , @xmath638 is strictly convex , and @xmath639 contains a one  dimensional linear subspace @xmath640 .",
    "assume that @xmath641\\in\\omega(\\s)$ ] and let @xmath642}$ ] denote the corresponding affine chart in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath643 denote the open toric subprevariety of @xmath1 .",
    "the toric morphism @xmath644 is weakly proper and hence ( ca ) holds for @xmath645 .",
    "now let @xmath139 be an @xmath4invariant morphism .",
    "then @xmath646 factors uniquely through @xmath645 , i.e.  there is a unique morphism @xmath647 such that @xmath648 on @xmath10 .",
    "the toric quotient @xmath649 ( where @xmath650 ) is even an affine quotient and hence categorical .",
    "so we similarly obtain a unique morphism @xmath651 such that @xmath652 on @xmath653 .",
    "the morphisms @xmath654 and @xmath655 glue together to a morphism @xmath585 , where @xmath475 denotes the affine system of fans obtained from @xmath248 and @xmath656 as maximal cones by glueing them only along the zero cone .",
    "we have @xmath657 , where @xmath658 denotes the natural toric morphism .",
    "since @xmath659 , we can conclude from proposition [ kegelvergroesserung ] that @xmath660 or there exists a non  trivial linear subspace @xmath661 that is contained in the support of an @xmath587equivalence class .",
    "since @xmath662 , in any case we have a one  dimensional linear subspace contained in the support of an @xmath587equivalence class . and @xmath587 is invariant with respect to the associated subtorus @xmath663 of the big torus @xmath91 of @xmath103 .",
    "so @xmath85 is invariant with respect to @xmath664 .",
    "that shows that in fact @xmath3 is the separated toric quotient of @xmath1 with respect to a torus of codimension at most @xmath19 , and we are back in the first case .",
    "in this section we give an example of a @xmath14action on a @xmath13dimensional toric variety with @xmath665dimensional toric quotient space , such that the toric quotient @xmath2 is categorical , but not uniform in the sense of mumford , i.e. there is a saturated @xmath5stable open subset @xmath666 of @xmath1 such that the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath666 is not the categorical quotient of @xmath666 .",
    "note that @xcite also contains an example of a categorical quotient that is not uniform .",
    "but in that example the dimension of the quotient space is not maximal but strictly less than @xmath667 .",
    "let @xmath668 be the @xmath13dimensional toric variety associated to the fan @xmath124 in @xmath669 with the following four maximal cones : @xmath670 let @xmath671 denote the linear map given by the matrix @xmath672 then following diagram shows the images of the maximal cones in @xmath673 .",
    "note that @xmath674 in this case is a convex cone .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the toric variety associated to the fan in @xmath673 with the two maximal cones @xmath675 and @xmath676 . the lattice homomorphism @xmath199 defines a toric morphism @xmath2 , and in fact @xmath3 is the toric quotient of @xmath1 by the action of the one  dimensional subtorus @xmath4 corresponding to the kernel of @xmath199 , which is generated by @xmath677 in @xmath678 .",
    "since @xmath3 is weakly proper and @xmath679 , the toric quotient in this case is even categorical .",

    "the toric variety @xmath666 admits a good quotient , and its quotient space is @xmath684 .",
