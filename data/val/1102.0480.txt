    "many interesting problems in astrophysics and engineering involve evolution of macroscopic plasmas , modeled by the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) . these equations ( @xcite )",
    "are a system of convection - diffusion equations with the magnetic resistivity and heat conduction playing the role of diffusion .",
    "many applications like plasma thrusters for deep space propulsion and electromagnetic pulse devices ( @xcite ) involve small ( but non - zero ) values of the magnetic resistivity .",
    "hence , the design of efficient numerical methods for the resistive mhd equations is essential for simulating some of the afore mentioned models .    numerical study of the ideal mhd equations ( where magnetic resistivity and other diffusions terms are neglected ) has witnessed considerable progress in recent years and a variety of numerical methods are available ( see @xcite for a review of the available literature ) .",
    "the design of numerical schemes for the resistive mhd equations has not reached the same stage of maturity as the presence of magnetic resistivity complicates the design of stable methods even further .",
    "given the formidable difficulties , study of prototypical sub - models ( that mirror some , but not all of the difficulties of the resistive mhd equations ) can be a useful guide for obtaining robust methods for the resistive mhd equations .    in this paper , we consider the magnetic induction equations with resistivity .",
    "recent papers ( @xcite ) have pointed out the role that the magnetic induction equation ( without resistivity ) plays in the design of numerical schemes for the ideal ( inviscid ) mhd equations .",
    "the induction equations with resistivity can play a similar role for designing stable methods for the resistive mhd equations .",
    "our goal in this paper is to design stable and high - order accurate numerical schemes for the magnetic induction equations with resistivity .",
    "we start with a brief description of how the equations are derived . in a moving medium , the time rate of change of the magnetic flux across a given surface @xmath0 bounded by curve @xmath1",
    "is given by ( see @xcite ) : @xmath2 where the unknown @xmath3 denotes the magnetic field , @xmath4 the current density and @xmath5 are the spatial coordinates .",
    "the current density is given by : @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 denotes the magnetic resistivity , and @xmath8 the ( given ) velocity field .    using faraday s law : @xmath9 stokes theorem , the fact that the electric field @xmath10 in a co - moving frame and @xmath11 we obtain , @xmath12 magnetic monopoles have never been observed in nature . as a consequence , the magnetic field",
    "is always assumed to be divergence free , i.e. , @xmath13 . using this constraing in",
    ", we obtain the system : @xmath14 the above equation is an example of a convection - diffusion equation .",
    "the version obtained by taking zero resistivity ( @xmath15 ) in is termed the magnetic induction equation ( @xcite ) . a standard way to obtain a bound on the solutions of convection - diffusion equations like",
    "is to use the energy method .",
    "however is not symmetrizable . consequently it may not be possible to obtain an energy estimate for this system",
    "on the other hand , is symmetrizable .",
    "we use the following vector identity @xmath16 and rewrite in the form , @xmath17 where the matrix @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 introducing the matrix , @xmath20 can also be written in the following form , @xmath21 where @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "note that the symmetrized matrices in are diagonal and that the coupling in the equations are through both the lower order source terms and the viscous terms .",
    "furthermore , taking the divergence of both sides of we obtain , @xmath24 hence , if @xmath25 , it follows that @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that all the above forms , and are equivalent ( at least for smooth solutions ) .",
    "although the magnetic induction equations with resistivity are linear , the coefficients are functions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 . therefore , closed form solutions are not available and we must resort to numerical methods in order to calculate ( approximate ) solutions .",
    "consequently , it is important to design efficient numerical methods for these equations .    as mentioned before",
    "the magnetic induction equations is a sub - model in the resistive mhd equations .",
    "hence , design of stable and high - order accurate numerical schemes for the viscous induction equations can lead to robust schemes for the non - linear resistive mhd equations .",
    "the presence of the @xmath30 constraint leads to numerical difficulties .",
    "small divergence errors may change the nature of results from numerical simulations ( see @xcite for details on the role of divergence in ideal mhd codes ) .",
    "our approach to treating the constraint follows the method developed in @xcite and involves discretizing .",
    "tfurthermore , a proper discretization of the symmetric form yields energy estimates .",
    "these estimates are vital in proving existence of weak solutions .",
    "we will approximate spatial derivatives by second and fourth order sbp ( `` summation by parts '' ) operators .",
    "the boundary conditions of both the dirichlet and mixed type are weakly imposed by using a sat ( `` simultaneous approximation term '' ) .",
    "this work is an extension of the sbp - sat schemes for the case without resistivity ( @xmath15 ) found in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that other numerical frameworks like mixed finite elements , discrete duality finite volume or mimetic finite differences might also lead to stable schemes for approximating the induction equations with resistivity .",
    "however , we are not aware of any papers that have approximated the resistive induction equations with these approaches .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : cp ] , we state the energy estimate for the initial - boundary value problem corresponding to in order to motivate the proof of stability for the scheme .",
