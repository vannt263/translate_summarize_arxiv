    "details of pulsars discovered in the survey are placed on the www at the time of acceptance of the paper announcing the discoveries , or 18 months after confirmation of the detection , whichever is first .",
    "raw data tapes from the survey are made available for copying two years after recording .",
    "details of pulsars observations which fall into these categories can be found on http://www.atnf.csiro.au/ @xmath0pulsar / psr / pmsurv / pmwww/. there is no observatory - based archive , so access to the data should be negotiated with project pis .",
    "one - bit samples are recorded at a rate of 4 khz for each of the 96 channels per beam .",
    "each 35 minute survey observation with the 13-beam system fills 1.3 gbytes ( @xmath0100 mbytes per beam ) in its raw form .",
    "this is recorded on dlt7000 tapes which hold up to 35 gbytes and cost around us$80 each .",
    "about 3000 such observations will be made in completing the survey , giving a total data set of about 4 tbytes .",
    "our search processing requires 130 hours of cpu time on a sun ultra 1 for each 35 minute observation .",
    "data logs are available on http://www.atnf.csiro.au/@xmath0pulsar / psr / pmsurv / pmwww/. for the multibeam pulsar survey and followup timing projects the pis to contact are andrew lyne ( agl@jb.man.ac.uk ) or dick manchester ( rmanches@atnf.csiro.au ) or fernando camilo ( fernando@astro.columbia.edu ) .",

    "if you want a copy of the complete survey , you would need to bring a workstation , a dlt7000 tape drive and a drive for the media type of your choice .",
    "* timing data : * processed archives or toas can be made available by ftp , cd or exabyte . for raw data requests the above schemes for small and large requests would apply .",
