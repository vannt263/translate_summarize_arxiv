    "the accurate determination of gas phase metallicity represents a challenging topic for studies that aim at understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the metal content of a galaxy is regulated by complex interactions between physical processes occurring on different spatial and time scales : heavy elements produced by stellar activity contribute to the enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , while cosmological infall of pristine gas from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and outflows due to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and supernovae could dilute the ism and at the same time trigger new star formation episodes @xcite .",
    "these processes directly impact the global baryon cycle and thus affect other physical quantities strictly related to the history of chemical enrichment in galaxies like stellar mass ( m@xmath1 ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) ; therefore , relationships between these parameters and gas - phase metallicity are expected . indeed in the last decades strong observational evidences of a correlation between m@xmath1 and gas - phase metallicity ( the so called mass - metallicity relation , m - z ) have been reported by several studies , both in the local universe ( e.g. @xcite ) and at higher redshift , where signatures of a cosmic evolution have been found ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the intrinsic scatter in the m - z could be reduced when sfr is taken into account , introducing the concept of a fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) that reduces the m - z to a two - dimensional projection of a three dimensional surface .",
    "the fmr appear to be _ more fundamental _ in the sense that it does not seem to present clear signs of evolution up to z @xmath2 .",
    "even though the physical origin of these relations is still debated , the knowledge of the main properties of the m - z and the exact form of its dependence upon the sfr is important to investigate the processes regulating star formation and to assess the role of outflows in ejecting metals out of the galaxy @xcite ; this could provide crucial observational constraints for models aimed at reproducing the chemical evolution of galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "investigating the properties of these relationships and their redshift evolution requires precise and robust metallicity estimates .",
    "since the scatter in the fmr is of the order of @xmath3 dex @xcite , such a level of precision in metallicity determination would be desirable .",
    "there are several ways to measure abundances in galaxies , but unfortunately none of them is considered reliable or applicable over the whole metallicity range covered by large galaxy samples .",
    "the most commonly used method relies on the determination of the electron temperature of the nebulae responsible for emission lines in galaxies : in fact , electron temperature is known to be strongly correlated with metallicity , such that higher metallicities are associated to lower t@xmath4 , because forbidden emission lines from metals are the primary coolants in hii  regions .",
    "electron temperatures can be inferred by exploiting the temperature sensitive auroral to nebular line ratios of particular ions ( e.g. [ oiii ]  @xmath5/@xmath6 is one of the most widely used ) ; in fact , the atomic structure of these ions is such that auroral and nebular lines originate from excited states that are well spaced in energy and thus their relative level populations depend heavily on electron temperature .",
    "this so called t@xmath4  method is widely accepted as the preferred one to estimate abundances since it is a direct probe of the processes that regulate the physics of ionized nebulae .",
    "unfortunately , auroral lines are weak in most of individual galaxy spectra , especially for metal rich objects , which typically prevents the t@xmath4  from being used method to determine abundances of metal enriched galaxies .",
    "a different technique is based instead on exploiting the ratio between oxygen and hydrogen recombination lines ( rls ) : since these lines show a very weak dependence on electron temperature and density ( @xcite ) this is probably the most reliable method beacuse is unaffected by the typical biases of the t@xmath4  method associated with temperature fluctuations .",
    "typical discrepancies between t@xmath4  and rls based abundances are found to be of the order of @xmath7-@xmath8 dex , with the first ones underestimating the latter ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that metal rls yield nebular abundances in excellent agreement with stellar abundances for high metallicity systems , while in more metal - poor environments they tend to underestimate the stellar metallicities by a significant amount .",
    "however , rls are extremely faint ( even hundred times fainter than oxygen auroral lines ) and can not be detected in galaxies more distant than a few kpc @xcite .",
    "for this reason , different methods have been developed to measure abundances in faint , distant and high metallicity galaxies .",
    "in particular , it is known that some line ratios between strong collisionally excited lines ( cels ) and balmer lines show a dependence on metallicity , which can be either directly motivated or indirectly related to other physical quantities ( e.g. the ionization parameter ) .",
    "thus , it has been proposed that these line ratios could be calibrated against the oxygen abundance and used as metallicity indicators for galaxies in which the application of the t@xmath4  method is not possible due to the extreme faintness of auroral lines @xcite : these are referred to as the strong - line - methods .",
    "calibrations can be obtained either empirically , for samples in which metallicity have been previously derived with the t@xmath4  method ( e.g. @xcite ) , or theoretically , in which oxygen abundance have been inferred via photoionization models ( e.g. @xcite ) , or be a combination of the two .",
    "unfortunately , comparisons among metallicities estimated through different calibrations reveal large discrepancies , even for the same sample of objects , with variations up to @xmath9 dex @xcite .",
    "in fact , theoretical calibrations are known to produce higher metallicity estimates with respect to empirical calibrations based on the t@xmath4  method .",
    "the origin of these discrepancies is still unclear , but they could be attributed on one hand to oversimplified assumptions made in most of the photoionization models , e.g. about the geometry of the nebulae and the age of the ionizing source @xcite and on the other hand to temperature gradients and fluctuations that may cause an overestimate of the electron temperature and a consequent underestimate of the true metallicity with the t@xmath4  method @xcite .",
    "great care is therefore needed when using composite calibrations built with different methods over different metallicity ranges , due to the large uncertainties introduced on the absolute metallicity scale .",
    "empirical calibrations are generally preferable because they are based on the t@xmath4  method abundance scale , which is directly inferred from observed quantities . moreover , on the abundance scale based on photoionization models the milky way , where abundances can be precisely measured , would represent a very peculiar galaxy , falling well below the m - z defined by similar star forming galaxies",
    ". the discrepancy is reduced by more empirical metallicity calibrations that provide lower abundances . at the same time , one of their main limitations is that they are often calibrated for samples of objects that do not properly cover all the galaxy parameters space ; this means , for example , that empirical calibrations obtained from a sample of low excitation hii  regions could give unreliable results when applied to global galaxy spectra .",
    "recently , the application of integral field spectroscopy allowed to study galaxy properties in great detail and to extend the hii  regions database for compiling abundances in order to obtain calibrations based on the t@xmath4  method ( e.g. @xcite for the califa survey ) . however , self - consistent calibrations obtained from integrated galaxy spectra and covering the entire metallicity range are still scarce .    in this work",
    "we derive a set of new empirical calibrations for some of the most common strong line metallicity indicators , thanks to a uniform application of the t@xmath4  method over the full metallicity range covered by sdss galaxies .",
    "we combined a sample of low metallicity galaxies with [ oiii ]  @xmath5 detection from the sdss together with stacked spectra of more than @xmath10 galaxies in bins of log[oii]/h@xmath0 - log[oiii]/h@xmath0 that allowed us to detect and measure the flux of the crucial auroral lines needed for the application of the t@xmath4  method also at high metallicity .",
    "other studies demonstrated the potentiality and reliability of the stacking technique @xcite ; compared to these works , our approach differs in the sense that we do not rely on any assumption regarding the nature and the form of the relationships between metallicity , mass and sfr , but only on the hypothesis that oxygen abundance can be determined from a combination of [ oii ]  and [ oiii ]  emission line ratios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we describe the sample selection and the procedure used to stack the spectra , subtract the stellar continuum and fit the emission lines of interest .",
    "section [ sec : temp_abund ] describes the method we used to derive electron temperatures and chemical abundances .",
    "we then discuss the relations between different temperature diagnostics and between temperatures of different ionization zones . in section [ sec : stack_tests ]",
    "we report some tests we performed to verify the consistency of our hypothesis and stacking procedure . in section",
    "[ sec : calib ] we present our new empirical calibrations for some of the most common strong - line abundances diagnostics and we compare them with previous ones from literature .",
    "we then apply them to the original sdss sample as a test of their self consistency .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarize our main results .",
    "a publicly available user - friendly routine to apply our new calibrations can be found on the webpage http://www.arcetri.astro.it / metallicity/.",
    "our galaxy sample come from the sdss data release @xmath11 ( dr@xmath11 ; @xcite ) , a survey including @xmath12 galaxies in an area of @xmath13 square degrees .",
    "emission line data has been taken from the mpa / jhu catalog , in which also stellar masses @xcite , sfrs @xcite and metallicities @xcite are measured .",
    "we chose only galaxies with redshifts in the range @xmath14 , to ensure the presence of the [ oii ]  @xmath15 emission line and of the [ oii ]  @xmath16 doublet within the useful spectral range of the sdss spectrograph ( @xmath17-@xmath18 ) .",
    "we selected only galaxies classified in the mpa / jhu as star forming , discarding galaxies dominated by agn contribution according to criteria for bpt - diagram classification illustrated in @xcite , in order to avoid any effect on the emission line ratios that could cause spurious metallicity measurements .",
    "we also used a snr threshold of @xmath19 on the h@xmath20 , h@xmath0 , [ oiii ]  @xmath21 and [ oii ]  @xmath15 emission line fluxes . after applying these selection criteria the total number of galaxies in our sample",
    "was reduced to @xmath22 , with a median redshift of @xmath23 . at this redshift",
    ", the @xmath24 diameter of the sdss spectroscopic fiber corresponds to @xmath25 kpc .",
    "[ fig : mappa_ogg ]    our primary goal is to perform accurate measurements of galaxy metallicity in order to obtain more consistent calibrations for the main strong - line indicators , thanks to a uniform application of the t@xmath4  method . unfortunately , in distant galaxies the [ oiii ]  @xmath5 and [ oii ]  @xmath16 auroral lines are too weak to be detected in the individual spectra at metallicities higher than @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we decided to stack spectra for galaxies that are expected to have similar metallicities .",
    "galaxies are stacked according to their values of reddening corrected [ oii]@xmath15/h@xmath0 and [ oiii]@xmath21/h@xmath0 flux ratios .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the so called strong - line methods can be used to discriminate the metallicities of star forming galaxies when multiple line ratios are simultaneously considered .",
    "we stress that we are not assuming that a particular combination of these line ratios , such as r@xmath27 , is related to metallicity , but only that galaxies with simultaneously the same values of both [ oiii]@xmath21/h@xmath0 and [ oii]@xmath21/h@xmath0 have approximately the same oxygen abundance .",
    "in fact , these are the two line ratios directly proportional to the main ionization states of oxygen and are thus individually used as metallicity diagnostics @xcite .",
    "moreover , their ratio [ oiii]/[oii ] is sensitive to the ionization parameter and it is also used as an indicator of oxygen abundance , especially in metal enriched galaxies , due to the physical link between ionization and gas - phase metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the location of a galaxy on the [ oii]@xmath15/h@xmath0-[oiii]@xmath21/h@xmath0 diagram is primarily driven by the metal content and the ionization properties of galaxies . since the scatter in a given line ratio at fixed metallicity is often regarded as driven by variations in the ionization parameter ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) our binning choice takes into account this possible source of scatter .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows the distribution of our selected sdss galaxies in the log [ oii]@xmath15/h@xmath0 - log [ oiii]@xmath21/h@xmath0 diagnostic diagram .",
    "we overplot the semi - empirical calibration of @xcite for the [ oii]@xmath21/h@xmath0 and [ oiii]@xmath21/h@xmath0 indicators in order to better visualize how the position on the 2d - diagram given by the combination of these line ratios represent a metallicity sequence .",
    "the curve , color coded for the metallicity inferred from the combination of the two indicators , follows quite tightly the distribution of galaxies on the map , showing how metallicity increases from the upper left region of the diagram to the bottom left one . to further illustrate how metallicity varies along this diagram we can also use the metallicity obtained with the t@xmath4  method from composite spectra in bins of stellar mass by @xcite , whose stacks",
    "are shown as circled points in the left panel of the figure .",
    "also in this case we can recognize a pattern in which their mass stacks , each point being representative of the line ratios measured from the associated composite spectra , increase monotonically in metallicity following the galaxy sequence on the diagram .",
    "thus , both methods reveal a clean variation of oxygen abundance with location on the diagram , though being based on different and independent approaches ; this strengthens the idea of using the combination of [ oii]/h@xmath0 and [ oiii]/h@xmath0 as a metallicity indicator .",
    "we note that differences among metallicity values predicted by the @xcite calibrations and the @xcite stacks ( with the first ones predicting higher abundances than the latter ) is only due to the different abundance scale upon which the two methods are defined , being the @xcite indicators calibrated with photoionization models at high metallicities and the @xcite stacks based on t@xmath4  method metallicities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stack_tests ] we test our assumptions by comparing t@xmath4  metallicities inferred from single galaxy spectra belonging to the same bin ; this allows also to evaluate the main issues related to the stacking technique ( see also the discussion in sec . [",
    "sec : trel ] ) .",
    "we refer to these sections for an exhaustive discussion on this topic .",
    "we thus created stacked spectra in bins of @xmath28 dex of log [ oii]/h@xmath0 and log [ oiii]/h@xmath0 .",
    "the choice of the @xmath28 dex width in the binning grid represents a good compromise between keeping an high enough number of galaxy in each bin to ensure auroral line detection and at the same time avoid wider bins in which we could have mixed object with too different properties .",
    "we performed some tests in stacking spectra and computing oxygen abundance with different bin sizes , finding no relevant differences .",
    "we adopted the emission line values provided by the mpa / jhu catalog to create the set of galaxy stacks .",
    "all line fluxes have been corrected for galactic reddening , adopting the extinction law from @xcite and assuming an intrinsic ratio for the balmer lines h@xmath20/h@xmath29 ( as set by case b recombination theory for typical nebular temperatures of @xmath30 @xmath31 and densities of @xmath32 @xmath33 ) .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : mappa_ogg ] the binning grid for our galaxy sample in the space defined by log([oii ]  @xmath15/h@xmath0 ) and log([oiii ]  @xmath21/h@xmath0 ) is shown , color coded by the number of objects in each bin .",
    "in the up - right corner of the figure we show the distribution of the galaxy sample in the diagnostic diagram , with our binning grid superimposed . in the construction of our binning grid we required a minimum of @xmath34 sources per bin",
    ": this was a conservative choice in order to average enough galaxy spectra to ensure the required snr ( i.e. at least @xmath35 ) on auroral lines detection after the stacking procedure . since we imposed a threshold of 100 sources per bin , the upper - left corner of the diagram , occupied by the galaxies of lower metallicity in the sample ,",
    "is not well covered by our stacking grid .",
    "for this reason , we extended our grid to include also low - metallicity galaxies by reducing the threshold to @xmath36 sources in that area of the diagram , enough to detect auroral lines in stacked spectra with a snr higher than @xmath35 in this metallicity regime .",
    "this extension of the grid is marked with orange borders in the figure .",
    "this allows our grid to entirely cover the region occupied by sdss galaxies , probing the largest possible combination of physical parameters in the sample . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to a particular stack by indicating the center of the corresponding bin in both the line ratios considered ( e.g. @xmath37 corresponds to the bin centered in log[oii ]  @xmath15/h@xmath38 and log[oiii ]  @xmath21/h@xmath39 ) .    before creating the composite spectrum from galaxies belonging to the same bin",
    ", each individual spectrum has been corrected for reddening with a @xcite extinction law and normalized to the extinction corrected h@xmath0 .",
    "we have verified that the final results do not depend on the choice of the extinction law , by alternatively using the @xcite extinction law in a few random bins .",
    "then , each spectrum has been re - mapped onto a linear grid ( @xmath40-@xmath18 ) , with wavelength steps of @xmath41 , and shifted at the same time to the rest frame to compensate for the intrinsic redshift of the sources .",
    "this procedure may cause a redistribution of the flux contained in a single input channel to more than one output channel ; in order to take into account this effect , the incoming flux is weighted on the overlap area between the input and output channels . finally , to create the stacked spectra we took the mean pixel by pixel between the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 percentile of the flux distribution in each wavelength bin ; in this way we could avoid biases introduced by the flux distribution asymmetry clearly visible in every flux channel as a right - end tail .      stacking the spectra",
    "improve significantly the snr of the auroral lines , but we must also fit and subtract the stellar continuum to accurately measure their fluxes . to perform the stellar continuum fit and subtraction on our stacked spectra",
    "we have created a synthetic spectrum using the miuscat library of spectral templates @xcite , an extension of the previous miles library @xcite in which both indo - u.s . and",
    "cat libraries have been added to fill the gaps in wavelength coverage .",
    "the new miuscat library covers a wavelength range of @xmath44-@xmath45 , although the useful spectral window for this work is entirely covered by miles templates , whose resolution is @xmath46(fwhm ) .",

    "to further improve emission line fluxes measurements , stellar continuum fits and subtractions have been performed selecting subregions of the spectrum centred on the lines of interest , each subregion being large a few hundred angstrom . during the procedure the location of the emission lines have been masked out in order to prevent the fit to be affected by non stellar features .",

    "is generally strongly peaked , even though we are affected by different dispersions when considering different positions on our stacking grid .",
    "this means that a given line ratio , as measured from the stacked spectra , can be respectively more or less representative of the distribution of galaxies inside a given bin for different positions on the diagram .",
    "however , for every diagnostic ratio here considered , the typical dispersion of its distribution inside a given bin is of the order of @xmath28 dex ( or less ) , thus being consistent with the choice of our bin size . in figure [ fig : calibrazioni ] we compare our new calibrations with those from @xcite .",
    "they obtained semi empirical calibrations combining direct abundance determination for galaxies from the @xcite sample with metallicity estimation from theoretical models by @xcite .",
    "the two calibrations agree well , as expected , for most of the indicators at low metallicities , the main discrepancies arising in the high metallicity regime where t@xmath4  method metallicities of our stacks result lower than those predicted by photoionization models .",
    "this introduce a clear deviation in the slope in all our calibrations , that change significantly their steepness after @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , we note that the highest metallicities inferred from our composite spectra are only slightly higher ( @xmath55 dex ) than the solar value .    for the o@xmath56n@xmath57 and n@xmath57 indicators we can compare our calibrations also with empirical ones from @xcite and @xcite , who used single hii  regions and not integrated galaxy spectra to calibrate these line ratios against metallicity .",
    "our calibrations have comparable slopes to those of @xcite , but they present a systematic offset towards higher metallicities .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that calibrations entirely based on hii  regions like @xcite are biased towards high excitation conditions and low metallicities .",
    "our n@xmath57 calibration is in good agreement with @xcite at low metallicities but diverge , in the direction of predicting higher abundances , in the middle region . at metallicities close to solar",
    "this diagnostic begin to saturate , as expected from the fact that nitrogen becomes the dominant coolant of the ism : the two calibrations then become comparable again .",
    "the o@xmath56n@xmath57 calibration instead presents a different slope than the @xcite since the slope of their calibration is determined by the use of photoionization models at high metallicities due to the lack in their sample of hii  regions with direct abundances in that region of the diagram .",
    "we note that our calibrations are better constrained to be used for integrated galaxy spectra , since single hii  regions upon which most of the empirical calibrations are based on do not properly and fully cover the parameter space where many galaxies lie .    in figure",
    "[ fig : calibrazioni ] we also compare our calibrations for the n@xmath57 and o@xmath56n@xmath57 indicators with those derived by @xcite , who derived oxygen abundances with the t@xmath4  method from stacked spectra in bins of stellar mass and @xmath58(ssfr ) , i.e. the deviation of the specific star formation rate from the star forming main sequence ( sfms ) @xcite .",

    "every strong - line indicator is identified by a different colour , and in each panel the name of the reference indicator is written in the upper region . the @xmath58log(o / h ) is then evaluated as the difference between the metallicity probed by the reference indicator and the metallicities estimated with the other four ; in each panel the average offset of the @xmath58log(o / h ) distribution and the associated @xmath65 are reported .",
    "inspection of the different panels of figures [ fig : histo_cal1 ] and [ fig : histo_cal2 ] reveals that metallicities probed by different indicators are in good agreement among each other , with average offsets below @xmath66 dex and typical dispersions below @xmath28 dex .",
    "the little systematic metallicity overestimate reported for the o@xmath63 indicator and underestimate for the n@xmath57 indicator with respect to the others can be accounted for as a product of the fitting procedure . in this sense , the use of higher order polynomials allow to straighten the consistency of all our calibrations , since it minimizes the mutual disagreement between metallicity determined with different indicators .",
    "thus , figures [ fig : histo_cal1 ] and [ fig : histo_cal2 ] show that consistent metallicities are obtained in individual galaxies when using different calibrations , allowing to compare for example abundances obtained from diagnostics located in different spectral regions .    from the above considerations",
    ", we can say that our calibrations represent a self consistent set totally based on the t@xmath4  metallicity scale .",
    "this is important since at the present time there is not an established absolute abundance scale for galaxies .",
    "most of the calibrations found in literature either rely on the assumptions of photoionization models or are based on individual hii  regions metallicities . in the first case the metallicity scale defined by models is inconsistent with the t@xmath4  scale . in the second case",
    "the emission lines properties of hii  regions differs from those of integrated galaxy spectra and higher excitation conditions affect t@xmath4  abundances estimation towards lower values . until the number of high metallicity galaxy with detected auroral lines will increase , allowing to build fully t@xmath4  method calibrations based on samples of individual objects , our stacking technique represents a valuable approach to define t@xmath4  based calibrations",
    "however , it should be stressed that metallicity estimates obtained from these calibrations are always affected by the particular choice of the stacking procedure .",
    "for example , the @xcite calibrations from stacked spectra in bins of stellar mass and @xmath58(ssfr ) rely on a particular parametrization of the local star forming main sequence and their metallicity predictions could differ from ours despite the fact that abundances are evaluated with the t@xmath4  method in both cases .    in this work we chose to re - calibrate the strong - line diagnostics relying only on the values assumed by galaxies on particular emission line ratios , thus assuming only the validity of the strong - line - methods to infer metallicity from spectra of star forming galaxies . in this way",
    "our calibrations could be in principle applied to a great variety of cases , in particular to large ifu galaxy surveys that allow spatially resolved abundance studies ( e.g califa , @xcite , manga , @xcite or sami , @xcite ) .",
    "in such cases for example , the use of our calibrations allows to relax the assumption that scaling relations well assessed on global scales ( e.g. the m - z and the m - z - sfr relations ) still hold on smaller , local ones .",
    "we provided new and totally empirical calibrations for some of the most widely used strong - line diagnostics for the determination of oxygen abundance in star forming galaxies .",
    "these relations have been derived combining a sample of single low metallicity galaxies together with the stacking of more than @xmath10 galaxies of the sdss in bins of @xmath28 dex in the log [ oii ]  @xmath67/h@xmath0 - log [ oiii ]  @xmath68/h@xmath0 diagram , just assuming that galaxies with such similar strong line ratios also show similar metallicity ( i.e. assuming the validity of the so called strong line method ) .",
    "the increase in signal - to - noise ratio provided by the stacking procedure allowed us to detect and measure both the [ oiii ]  @xmath5 and [ oii ]  @xmath69 auroral lines necessary to compute electron temperatures of the different ionization zones and apply the t@xmath4  method for measuring metallicity on the full range of metal abundances spanned by galaxies in the sdss survey . here",

    "in fact , we find that our most metal rich stacks have oxygen abundance significantly lower than those predicted by models , and at most @xmath77 dex higher than the solar one ( i.e. @xmath78 ) .",
    "on the other hand , classical empirical calibrations obtained from hii  regions samples generally show lower metallicities for fixed line ratios , probably due to the fact that the single hii  regions used for those calibrations are somehow biased towards high excitation conditions in order to ensure auroral line detection at high metallicity .",
    "* we applied our calibrations to the original sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "metallicity estimates from different calibrations result in good agreement between each other , with typical average offsets lower than @xmath66 dex and dispersions of the order of @xmath3 dex .",
    "we do not find any systematic effect of metallicity overestimate or underestimate between the different diagnostics .",
    "thus , our calibrations represent a self consistent set that could be used in a variety of different cases depending on the availability of emission lines ."
