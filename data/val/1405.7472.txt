    "modifications of the theory of general relativity ( gr ) have been of interest .",
    "particularly , some modifications that introduce second ( or higher ) order terms of curvature tensors represent high - energy corrections to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the chern - simons ( cs ) correction is one of modified gravity models .",
    "the cs modification is not an _ ad hoc _ extension , but it is actually motivated by both string theory , as a necessary anomaly - canceling term to conserve unitarity @xcite , and loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , as a counter term for the anomaly@xcite and recently as the emergence of the cs gravity when the barbero - immirzi parameter of lqg is promoted to a scalar field and the holst action is coupled to fermions @xcite .",
    "cs modifications to gravity were first formulated in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "several authors investigated the structure of these theories in 3 + 1 dimensions to show that they could arise as a low - energy limit of string theory @xcite .",
    "the theory and formulation of cs modified gravity have been discussed in a number of papers ( see @xcite for a review ) , and possible imprint of such a modification in the early universe has been recently investigated .",
    "moreover , there has been little work on tests of such cs corrections in the present universe .    in nondynamical cs gravity , a scalar field",
    "is assumed to be externally prescribed .",
    "it is often taken to be a linear function of the coordinate time ( as a canonical choice ) , and induces parity violation in the theory .",
    "nondynamical cs gravity depends on a single free parameter @xcite .",
    "the constraint on this parameter with measurements of frame - dragging of bodies orbiting the earth has been discussed ; the proposal has been implemented by ali - haimoud and chen @xcite to constrain cs gravity ; yunes and spergel , and ali - haimoud @xcite have used double - binary - pulsar measurements .",
    "in addition to cosmological and astrophysical tests , current attempts to probe general relativistic effects in quantum mechanics focus on precision measurements of phase shifts in quantum interferometers ( e.g. @xcite ) . toward a test of parity violation in a gravity theory beyond gr , okawara and",
    "his collaborators have recently studied a possible constraint by neutron interferometers @xcite , where they used alexander and yunes ( ay ) model .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to improve the previous results on the interferometers regarding two points @xcite .",
    "one improvement is that the present paper considers an up - dated nondynamical cs model that has been developed by smith , erickcek , caldwell , and kamionkowski ( seck ) @xcite in order to study both interior and exterior gravitational fields by a spinning object , whereas ay model assumes a point - like spinning object .",
    "seck model can treat an extended source of the gravitational field and , in some limit , it approaches ay model . because of including a mass parameter ( through a homogeneous solution to the field equation ) , seck model shows oscillating behavior of the gravitational potential along the radial direction of a central object . as a result , we shall study altitudinal dependence of sagnac effect in the present paper .",
    "the other improvement is that we consider sagnac interferometers in optics .",
    "this is more advantageous at present , mainly because it is relatively easy to put at different places sagnac interferometers compared with neutron interferometers that need nuclear reactors as a source of neutrons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii briefly reviews seck model of nondynamical cs gravity theory and the relativistic sagnac effect . in sec .",
    "iii , we compute relativistic sagnac effects in the cs model . sec .",
    "iv provides numerical calculations .",
    "v is devoted to conclusion .    throughout this paper ,",
    "latin indices run from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , while greek ones from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "this section summarizes the basics of computing a phase difference in sagnac interferometer by cs modified gravity .      the sagnac effect , which is often called sagnac interference , originally describes a phenomenon encountered in interferometry that is elicited by rotation .",
    "it appears manifestly in a setup called a ring interferometer .",
    "similar effects due to relativistic gravitomagnetic fields in a stationary spacetime are often called relativistic sagnac effects . for instance , see @xcite for a review of ring - laser tests of fundamental physics . yet , a recent proposal of an experimantal scheme to measure the lense - thirring ( lt ) effect with a sagnac interferometer is still a long way from reality ( see e.g. @xcite ) . accroding to @xcite , _ g in geodetic observatory wettzell _ ,",
    "the best ring laser in the world , already achieves the accuracy within one order of magnitude from the expected signal for detections of lt effects .",
    "aiming at the lt detection , they are now planning a new experiment called _ ginger _ in order to reduce various sources of noises .",
    "therefore , such a drastic experimental progress is a major premise for our ambitious proposal of using a sagnac interferometer in order to testify to the cs effect separately from the lt one ( that has not been detected with any interferometer yet ) .",
    "consider two beams of monochromatic light in a closed path ( denoted by @xmath4 ) such as a ring or a square , where one beam is clockwise and the other anticlockwise .",
    "along the light path , we have @xmath5 . in the gravitomagnetic field , the leading contribution to the arrival time shift @xmath6 is given by the relativistic version of sagnac effect as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath4 denotes a * clockwise * closed path of a light beam .",
    "this formula is almost the same as that for a matter wave @xcite except for a factor 2 , if de broglie wavelength is replaced by the photon wavelength .",
    "see @xcite for relativistic higher order corrections . dividing the time shift by the wavelength of a photon @xmath8 , we obtain the phase difference as @xmath9    let us consider experiments near the surface of earth , for which we can assume a small perturbation around the minkowskian background spacetime as @xmath10 .",
    "the time - space component of the metric does matter in the relativistic sagnac formula .",
    "it is denoted as a spatial vector @xmath11 .",
    "the leading order of eq .",
    "( [ delta1 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath12 where we used stokes theorem , @xmath13 denotes the infinitesimal areal vector , and @xmath14 means the area of the sagnac interferometer .    note that the relativistic sagnac effect is dependent on the inner product as @xmath15 for the unit normal vector @xmath16 to the interferometer plane , whereas the relativistic gyroscope precession by @xmath17 depends mainly on the outer product as @xmath18 for the spin vector @xmath19 , roughly speaking .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a cs modification to general relativity .",
    "the present paper focuses on the leading - order cs correction due to the rotation of a central body . here",
    ", the earth is approximated by a spinning body that is a source of the gravitational field .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider nondynamical cs gravity in this paper , though more dynamical systems such as compact binaries and black hole formations may require a dynamical cs treatment because of their rapid changes in time and space @xcite .",
    "the exterior weak - field @xmath17 in gr , which causes the lt effect , is known to be @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radius of earth , @xmath22 is its mass , @xmath23 is its angular velocity , @xmath24 is the distance from the origin , and @xmath25 is the unit vertical vector .",

    "the order of magnitude of time difference by lt effects in gr is @xmath48 the magnitude of eq .",
    "( [ deltat - cs ] ) is roughly @xmath49 from these equations , one can estimate the size of the relativistic sagnac effect due to lt and cs , respectively",
    ".    the altitudinal dependence of cs effects might be negligible very near the surface of earth .",
    "however , the difference between the ground - based interferometer and one at an altitude @xmath50 km ( corresponding to the space station ) might become of the order of the unity for @xmath51 , for instance .",
    "this point will be discussed later in more detail .    here , we mention experimantal realities . with @xmath52 ,",
    "one finds the shift @xmath53 is of the order @xmath54 for an interferometer with an area of a square kilometer . in terms of strain @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the size of the interferometer ,",
    "the strain is @xmath57 . for a more modest meter - scale interferometer ,",
    "the strain is three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "while the modest setup might be more promising , the strain of @xmath58 is apparently reachable by gravitational wave detecters such as ligo ( on the ground ) and lisa ( in the space ) .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "the strain under study is essentially a dc ( namely zero - frequency ) strain , while gravitational - wave interferometers search high - frequency signals and they try to kill various noises at low frequency .",
    "according to previous works on the precession , @xcite there has been a constraint on @xmath0 as @xmath59 $ ] , roughly speaking .",
    "taking account of this existing constraint , numerical calculations are done for a parameter region @xmath60",
    "< m_{cs } < 0.1 [ \\mbox{km}^{-1}]$ ] in this paper .",
    "the time shift @xmath61 depends on four parameters as the cs mass parameter @xmath0 , the interferometer direction @xmath62 , the latitude @xmath63 , and the altitude @xmath64 , where @xmath62 is defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from a north base line or meridian .",
    "for instance , @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to the direction along @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the shift is dependent also on the zenith angle , which is not considered in the present paper .    as a reference ,",
    "let us consider the time shift @xmath69 due to lt effects in gr .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath70 as @xmath69 in the units of @xmath71 , namely the angular part of @xmath69 as @xmath72/|\\vec{\\omega}|$ ] .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the dependence of @xmath70 on the latitude and the direction .",
    "it follows that there are no oscillating behaviors in lt effects .",
    "note that lt effects vanish in the interferometer direction as @xmath73 and @xmath74 almost everywhere except for polar regions .",
    "this suggests that the eastbound direction of the interferometer might be preferred for testing cs , separately , because lt effects on this interferometer cancel out .",
    "first , we consider ground - based experiments @xmath75 , for which @xmath61 depends on the other three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath76 as @xmath61 in the units of @xmath77 , namely the angular part of @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows numerical calculations of the dependence of the time shift @xmath76 on the latitude @xmath63 and the direction @xmath62 , where we assume @xmath78 $ ] and the vertical axis denotes @xmath76 . for this case ,",
    "the cs effect becomes the largest around @xmath79 and @xmath80 for wide latitude regions from the equator to the middle latitude except for the polar regions .",
    "the latitudinal and directional dependence is weak around @xmath81 , while it is strong around @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , one can say that the cs latitudinal and directional effects might be important in experiments , especially when we investigate the parameter region @xmath82 .",
    "even if any imprint by cs were marginally detected in the future ( presumably at a low signal - to - noise ratio ) , it would be difficult to disentangle the cs signal from other effects without taking account of these dependencies .",
    "a comparison of phase measurements at two ( or more ) directions at different latitudes would be helpful for improving the cs bound or distinguishing the cs signal from others .",
    "namely , a signal - to - noise ratio could be enhanced by a combined analysis of phase measurements at different latitudes and directions .    before closing this section ,",
    "we mention the altitudinal dependence of the cs effect on the sagnac interference . in order to understand the dependence ,",
    "let us suppose two interferometers at different altitudes : one is located at @xmath21 and the other is at @xmath83 .",
    "( [ deltat - cs ] ) suggests that a height difference @xmath64 makes a change in the time difference , where we assume the same interferometers .",
    "the relative difference between two measurements is of the order of @xmath84 .",
    "for instance , @xmath85 where eq .",
    "( [ deltat - cs ] ) is used and we assume denver as a high city .",
    "hence , the height difference of the cs effect is very small on the surface of the earth .",
    "if the sagnac interferometer were located in the space , however , the altitudinal difference might become significant as @xmath86 where we assumed the international space station ( iss ) as an example .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows a comparison between the ground level and the iss site regarding the oscillating behaviors in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "the altitudinal effect might make a more complicated form of oscillating behaviors .",
    "such a altitudinal dependence might be helpful for a future test .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the time shift as a function of the orbital phase angle @xmath31 , which is nearly proportional to time because the iss moves on a nearly polar orbit .",
    "the iss is orbiting around the earth with the period of nearly 90 minutes .",
    "hence , the apparent zero - frequency strain due to the gravitomagnetic effects on such a satellite experiment can vary with time .",
    "this time variability might help separate the effects from the others .",
    "one could use this altitudinal dependence in order to place tighter constraints on the mass parameter in the future .",
    "for instance , a commercial ring laser as a long - term stable gyroscope is used in a number of airplanes .",
    "such an instrument , if it is sufficiently improved in the future , may be used for the present purpose .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated relativistic sagnac effects in cs modified gravity .",
    "the altitudinal , latitudinal and directional dependence of relativistic sagnac effect in the cs model is oscillatory in terms of the cs parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we have compared the cs effects on sagnac interferometers with the general relativistic lense - thirring ( lt ) effects .",
    "lt effects on the eastbound interferometer cancel out .",
    "therefore , our numerical calculations have suggested that the eastbound sagnac interferometer might be preferred for testing cs separately .    for some region of the cs parameter",
    "@xmath87 $ ] , the possible altitudinal dependence might become important when we consider a space experiment such as the iss site at @xmath88 .",
