    "the four open clusters located in nasa s kepler spacecraft field of view ( ngc 6866 , ngc 6811 , ngc 6819 and ngc 6791 ) , which range in age from less than 1 gyr to more than 8 gyr , are ideal targets for a variety of astrophysical investigations . the two older clusters , ngc 6819 and ngc 6791 have been thoroughly studied ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent kepler - related papers ) , but the other two are less well - known .",
    "we recently completed an analysis of ngc 6811 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) and we report here on ngc 6866 .",
    "recent publications on ngc 6866 include @xcite , who did a proper motion and ccd photometric study of the cluster ; photometric studies by @xcite and @xcite ; and an investigation by @xcite of rotations and pulsations of stars in the cluster using kepler data .",
    "frolov et al . found 423 likely cluster members and estimated the age of the cluster at 560 myr .",
    "joshi et al .",
    "derived @xmath4  mag .",
    ", an age of 630 myr and a distance of 1.47 kpc . from an analysis of 2mass jhk photometry , @xcite derived an age 0.8@xmath50.1 gyr , e(b - v ) = 0.19@xmath50.06 and @xmath6 .",
    "molenda - akowicz et al . and joshi et al .",
    "both found several variable stars in the cluster . in a survey of a number of clusters",
    ", @xcite derived a radial velocity of 12.18 @xmath5  1.14 km s@xmath7 and proper motions @xmath8   mas yr@xmath7 and @xmath9  mas yr@xmath7  for the cluster .",
    "the traditional approach to deriving the properties of star clusters from broad - band photometry is to `` fit '' theoretical stellar isochrones to the observed color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "but an isochrone is simply the locus of possible stars over a range of masses at fixed age in the cmd ( see figure [ theory]a ) .",
    "so at a given time , in a cluster with a finite number of stars , it is unlikely that any stars will actually be found along some sections of an isochrone .",
    "we have chosen instead to find the maximum - likelihood probability that the observed cluster stars embedded in a background population of field stars ( figure [ allbv]a ) could be drawn from a theoretical cmd , created by choosing a sample of stars from the models with a range of masses , as in figure [ theory]b .    by posing the problem in this way",
    ", we can take a modern bayesian approach to derive not only the cluster parameters , but also their uncertainties .    in  2",
    "we describe the photometry ;  3 is a discussion of the structural properties of the cluster ; the bayesian analysis is the topic of  4 ;  5 is a discussion of our results ; and  6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we acquired ccd images of the cluster and standard stars on four nights ( see table [ log ] ) , with the 1.2-meter hall and 1.8-meter perkins telescopes at lowell observatory .",
    "since we did all of our ngc 6866 observing on nights when we also observed ngc 6811 , the details of the observing and photometric reductions are given in paper i. the following is a summary of the observational program .",

    "we used iraf bias subtraction and flat fielding functions for our initial image processing .",
    "we used the sps program @xcite for psf - fitting photometry and we transformed the photometry to the ubvri colors as described in paper i. the calculated uncertainties in the transformation coefficients are all less than 0.01 mag .",
    "the standard deviations of the nightly b and v values from the four - night means and the average differences between the two nights each in u and i photometry are all within 0.01 magnitude .    to aid in merging the measurements from individual frames , we used stars from the kepler input catalog @xcite to develop preliminary transformation coefficients to the equatorial system relative to the assumed cluster center at ra = 20@xmath12  03@xmath13  55.0@xmath14 , dec = + 44@xmath15  09@xmath10   30.0@xmath16 .",
    "we assumed that star images with transformed coordinates within 0.5 arcseconds of one another on different frames are the same star , except that we rejected stars if a single star image on one frame was within 0.5 arcseconds of two stars on another frame .",
    "we also rejected stars with fewer than 3 b or v measurents or fewer than 2 r or i measurements or if the calculated standard deviation of the v magnitude or b - v color index is 0.1 magnitude or greater .",

    "using the data in table [ catalog ] , we derived the radial stellar density distribution about the cluster center .",
    "we calculated the areas of successive rings within which there are 75 stars between magnitudes 11 and 16 . from",
    "that we found the stellar density in each ring , as shown in figure [ profile ] .",
    "because the cluster is relatively sparse and embedded in a rich star field , we chose a simple exponential function to model the radial stellar density profile : @xmath25 where , @xmath26 refers to the peak of the radial stellar density distribution , @xmath27 is the background field stellar density .",
    "and the cluster core angular radius is @xmath28 .    assuming the stellar density profile of equation [ expfn ] , the effective angular radius is @xmath28 = 4.7 arcminutes and the peak cluster density is @xmath26 = 1.65 stars per square arcminute on a field background of 0.63 stars per square arcminute . after subtracting the background ,",
    "the integral of the exponential density function over all radii is @xmath29 which gives a cluster population of 114 stars brighter than magnitude 16 .",
    "this should be considered to be a lower limit to the cluster membership since there is likely to be an extended halo of stars photometrically undetectable against the background field population .",
    "proper motions or radial velocities would be required to distinguish halo cluster stars from field stars ; fortunately the goals of this project require only that a sufficiently large sample of high probability cluster stars be identified .",
    "bayes theorem states that @xmath30 where @xmath31   is the posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the model parameters , @xmath32 , given the data , @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34   is the prior pdf of the model parameters and @xmath35   is a likelihood function for the data , given a model .",
    "the denominator , @xmath36   is the integral of the numerator over all possible model parameters , and is ordinarily difficult to compute .",
    "however , it is effectively a normalizing constant , and the shape of the posterior pdf can be found without knowing @xmath36 .",
    "a thorough discussion of bayesian analysis can be found in @xcite ; for some astronomical applications , including deriving properties of star clusters , see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "our procedure is discussed in greater detail in paper i. the following is a brief summary of our cluster analysis procedure .",
    "_ priors _  the prior distribution , @xmath34 , constitutes a model for the cluster .",
    "the model parameters include global properties of distance modulus , reddening and a theoretical cmd of some age and metallicity , as well as the membership probability and binary star status of individual stars .",
    "because the global properties ( distance modulus , reddening , age and metallicity ) are chosen with equal probability within some range , their contribution to @xmath34 is effectively a constant and does not affect the shape of the posterior pdf . at each iteration ,",
    "the model consisted of a theoretical cmd created from an isochrone of the specified age and metallicity by selecting a set of stars with random masses from the isochrone .",
    "the theoretical cmd was corrected for the particular values of reddening and distance selected at this iteration .",
    "we ran two sets of models , one using the `` yale - yonsei '' ( yy ) isochrones @xcite and the other using `` padova '' isochrones @xcite .",
    "the models were allowed to range over values of @xmath37 ; @xmath38  age @xmath39 ; and @xmath40 .",
    "all distance moduli calculated in this paper are observed , v - band moduli , uncorrected for interstellar extinction .    _",
    "cluster membership _  we computed the prior membership probability for individual stars , based on their distance relative to the cluster center using equation [ expfn ] .",
    "so the prior membership probability for star @xmath41  is a purely astrometric quantity , @xmath42 at each iteration of the markov chain , we randomly selected 125 stars from the entire field with prior membership probabilities given by equation [ astrometry ] .",
    "that is to say , after randomly selecting a star from the catalog , we compared its prior membership probability as derived from equation [ expfn ] with a randomly chosen number from zero to one .",
    "if the star s membership probability exceeds that of the random number , it is added to the sample for that iteration . in this way , each star can be tested as a possible cluster member ; stars which are more often present in successful trials have a higher posterior membership probability , as discussed in the following .",
    "_ binary stars _  the large fraction of binaries among open cluster stars makes it difficult to define the location of the actual single - star main sequence , particularly near the turnoff",
    ". however , the binary status of individual stars can be added as parameters in the bayesian analysis .",
    "each star is assigned a binary mass ratio , and the merged magnitude and colors of an equivalent binary in the theoretical cmd is calculated and compared to the observed star . for the initial iteration , the binary mass ratio for all stars was taken to be zero .",
    "at each subsequent iteration , the mass ratio is randomly perturbed from the previous value with a gaussian probability ( see the hastings - metropolis algorithm below ) .",
    "_ likelihood function _",
    " for each observed star , @xmath41 , we find the distance , @xmath43  in units of the measurement errors in the 5-dimensional cmd space ( v , b - v , u - b , v - r , v - i ) to each of the theoretical stars , @xmath44 .",
    "the probability that @xmath43 is as small as it is by chance is the error function of @xmath43 , @xmath45 .",
    "the probability that the observed star could be drawn from the cmd of theoretical stars is given by @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{starprob}\\ ] ] so now from equations [ bayes ] and [ starprob ] , the operational bayesian model is @xmath47 which gives the probability that the observed sample of stars could be drawn from the theoretical sample .",
    "_ hastings - metropolis algorithm _ - the key to efficient sampling of the pdf is to develop a `` jump probability function , '' @xmath48 , to decide the transition from model @xmath32 to a new trial model @xmath49 so that @xmath49 depends on the current parameters but not on any previous values .",
    "the trial model , @xmath49 , consists of random proposed jumps , @xmath50 , from the current parameter values . the jump probability function can be written as @xmath51    if the jumps have a gaussian distribution , the proposal distributions are symmetrical and in this case , @xmath52 .",
    "a trial model is accepted as the next iteration when @xmath53   exceeds a random number in the range 0 to 1 ; if the trial model is not accepted , another @xmath54  is tested .",
    "improved solutions are always selected , but in addition , the entire parameter space is eventually sampled .",
    "we ran two chains of 105000 trials ; after throwing away the first 5000 trials in the `` burn - in '' period , we saved all trials satisfying the acceptance condition on the first try .",
    "see paper i for more information .",
    "the product of the above analysis is the posterior pdf , @xmath31 , a sequence of the parameter values for each successful trial . from the marginal distribution of each parameter ( found by integrating @xmath31 over all the other parameters ) ,",
    "its mean and variance can be found .",
    "the marginal distributions are shown in figure [ margins ] ; although the scale of the distributions are defined only by the unknown parameter @xmath36 , their means represent the maximum likelihood values of the parameters , and their standard deviations represent the parameter uncertainties .",
    "these are shown in table [ final ] .",
    "up to a constant , the prior pdf of an individual star is a single number , @xmath55 , given by equation [ astrometry ] .",
    "so now , the posterior pdf of star @xmath41  is just the product of @xmath55  and the individual likelihood parameter , @xmath56 , given by equation [ starprob ] . in figure [ cmdfits ]",
    "we included 125 stars with the largest values of the posterior membership probability .    for intermediate - age clusters like ngc 6866 , with few",
    "if any giant stars , there is little information in the cmd to distinguish clusters by age or metallicity .",
    "this problem is intrinsic to isochrone fitting to clusters in this age range , independent of the details of the analysis technique .",
    "furthermore , ngc 6866 is embedded in a rich field . as a consequence , although the procedure produces well - defined posterior pdf s , the marginal distributions are rather broad -",
    "i.e , the parameters are only moderately well constrained .",
    "the consequences of the indeterminancy between the effects of reddening and metallicity on photometry can be seen in figure [ twod ] , a contour plot of the marginal distribution of the number of samples in the e(b - v ) vs z plane .",
    "solutions with low reddening values tend to be correlated with those with high metallicity values .",
    "if one or the other were constrained by independent measures , the marginal distributions of the other parameters would be considerably sharper .",
    "there are indications of similar correlations between the other indices , but they are not as strong .",
    "we have produced a catalog of high - quality johnson / cousins ubvri photometry of stars in a large field around the cluster ngc 6866 .",
    "our photometry has been carefully transformed to the standard system as defined by the @xcite standard stars . using a bayesian analytical procedure",
    ", we derived the following values for the cluster properties : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , age @xmath2  myr and @xmath3 ( see also table [ final ] ) . assuming a canonical extinction - to - reddening ratio @xmath57 , the distance to the cluster is about 1250 parsecs .",
    "our results are in rough agreement with previous work on this cluster as discussed in the introduction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) as mentioned above , the lack of independent membership information , or , alternatively the cluster metallicity or reddening , limits the accuracy of photometric measurements of its age and distance .",
    "furthermore , most of the previous results were based , directly or indirectly , on visual comparisons of observed color - magnitude diagrams with theoretical isochrones of solar composition only ; for that reason , the quoted errors are likely to be highly optimistic , since they do not include the metallicity uncertainty . in particular , our analysis , as shown in figures [ margins ] and [ twod ] ,",
    "do not support a metallicity as high as solar .",
    "solar metallicity would require a reddening of essentially zero , unlikely in this direction in the galaxy .",
    "finally , the errors given in table 3 do not include any uncertainty in the theoretical models .",
    "in particular , figure [ cmdfits ] suggests that there may be a small inconsistency between the theoretical models and the observed cmd .",
