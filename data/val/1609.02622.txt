    "the natural flux of people s changing social ties and interests generates a dynamic social network .",
    "this invisible network can be observed by capturing daily or weekly snapshots of user activities on social media platforms and massively multiplayer online games ( mmogs ) .",
    "it is informative to study changes in the network at the _ community level _ , as well as the individual level .",
    "communities are emergent groups that are created as people form highly connected subnetworks with their families , co - workers , and friends . often communities are formed by participants with the same goals , interests , or a geographic location .",
    "for instance , in mmogs , network communities may emerge from guilds of players with common economic interests or alliances who share strategic goals . as the network changes , user groups can grow , shrink , or disappear , causing drastic changes in the total number of network communities .",
    "community detection can help us understand the hidden social structure of the user populations , but the dynamic aspect of networks can pose problems for standard algorithms",
    ". our method uses stochastic optimization to find the best community structure , assuming that the nodes are modeled as rational players who seek to maximize their personal utility while playing a _ community membership game _ with neighboring nodes . in this game , the active agent decides to join or leave different communities ; agents receive benefits from being part of the same community as their network neighbors but are penalized for joining too many communities .",
    "the nash equilibrium of the current game corresponds to the community structure of the current snapshot . as the network evolves",
    ", agents usually find it advantageous to modify their community membership strategy .",
    "this article examines the performance of varying the amount of information propagated from prior snapshots .",
    "even in dynamic networks , there are many nodes that retain the same community membership or rejoin their former communities . thus propagating information from previous snapshots",
    "can provide more favorable initialization conditions for the stochastic optimization procedure .",
    "much of the power of the d - gt framework ( originally introduced in @xcite ) lies in its potential for customization ; however , without guidance end users can be overwhelmed by myriad choices .",
    "our aim in this article is to present a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm s performance in common scenarios ; while retaining the same basic game - theoretic model , we evaluate different variations of our procedure .",
    "first , we examine the performance of different utility functions , a similarity - based utility function  @xcite vs.  the use of a personalized modularity function  @xcite .",
    "then we compare different initialization approaches in which the following information is propagated : 1 ) no information ( * d - gts * ) ; 2 ) the union of the community membership information over all snapshots ( * d - gt * ) ; 3 ) community membership information from the previous snapshot ( * d - gtp * ) ; 4 ) ground truth information for a small seed set ( * d - gtg * ) . our game - theoretic model is robust to minor changes in the procedure and most variants outperform the benchmarks .",
    "our experiments were conducted on networks created from different dynamic processes : internet routers ( as - oregon graph , the as - internet routers graph ) , shifting organization structure ( enron email dataset ) , citation graphs from arxiv ( hep - ph ) , and player interactions in massively multiplayer online games ( travian messages , travian trades ) .",
    "results were compared against five other methods : labelrankt , ilcd , oslom , infomap and louvain in terms of normalized mutual information ( nmi ) , modularity , and the number of detected communities .",
    "the next section presents an over - view of related work on community detection in dynamic networks .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] describes our problem formulation and our proposed method ( * * d**ynamic * * g**ame * * t**heoretic community detection ) . experimental results are provided in section  [ sec : results ] , before we conclude the article ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "the problem of community detection has been widely studied in the literature compared to the other research areas in the social networks  @xcite . in particular , in static networks",
    ", community detection has appeared in multiple disciplines including sociology and computer science .",
    "this has yielded a diverse set of approaches ranging from traditional network structure based algorithms  @xcite , optimization techniques  @xcite , label propagation  @xcite , propinquity  @xcite and information diffusion  @xcite . detecting community structure in dynamic networks , on the other hand ,",
    "has attracted less research attention due to the complexity of the problem and dearth of good datasets .",
    "there are some community detection algorithms originally design - ed for static networks that continue to perform well in dynamic datasets .",
    "for instance , lancichinetti et al.s oslom ( order statistics local optimization method ) works on single snapshots but also benefits from information from previous network partitions . like d - gt , oslom s optimization procedure can be initialized with the partition from the previous snapshot ; it aims to optimize cluster significance with respect to a global null model  @xcite .",
    "we use this method as one of our benchmarks , along with two other static community detection algorithms , louvain @xcite and infomap  @xcite .",
    "these algorithms perform well on many static community detection problems and have the benefit of being fast to compute on a single network snapshot .",
    "other network properties have also been used to perform dynamic community detection ; for instance hui et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a distributed method for community detection in which modularity was used as a measure instead of the objective function .",
    "qca ( quick community adaptation ) is a modularity - based approach that focuses explicitly on the changes in the network structure , rather than recomputing community structure from scratch at each time step  @xcite . in this article ,",
    "we evaluate the use of personal modularity as an alternative gain function to neighborhood similarity .",
    "some studies have focused on studying the evolution of communities over time .",
    "for instance , @xcite identified subsets of nodes ,  natural communities \" , that were stable to small perturbations of the input data .",
    "communities detected in later snapshots were matched to earlier snapshots using the natural community tree structure .",
    "palla et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an innovative method for detecting communities in dynamic networks based on the k - clique percolation technique ; in their approach , communities are defined as adjacent k - cliques , that share @xmath0 nodes .    machine learning has also been employed to model changes in community structure ; for instance , @xcite predict transitions in community structure by learning supervised machine learning classifiers .",
    "this requires data on past transitions to train the classifiers , which limits its applicability to certain datasets . @xcite",
    "adopt a data mining approach to detect clusters on time - evolving graphs ; community discovery and change detection are performed using the minimum description length ( mdl ) paradigm .    rather than independently detecting communities at each snapshot and matching them , another option is to make a local decision to add nodes to existing communities when new edges appear in the network .",
    "one of our benchmarks , ilcd ( intrinsic longitudinal community detection )  @xcite , updates the community structure of the network based on time - stamped sets of edges .",
    "nodes are added to communities if its mean number of second neighbors and robust second neighbors exceeds the current average for the community . however ,",
    "this model is limited to certain types of network changes , and can not handle interconnected pairs of nodes being simultaneously added or the removal of edges .",
    "optimization can be used to identify minimum cost community assignments in dynamic graphs .",
    "facetnet @xcite is a framework for analyzing communities in dynamic networks based on an optimization of snapshot costs .",
    "it is guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution ; however , its convergence speed is slow , and it needs to be initialized with the number of communities which is usually unknown in practice . @xcite modeled dynamic community detection as a multi - objective optimization problem .",
    "their approach is parameter free and uses evolutionary clustering to optimize a dual objective function .",
    "the first objective selects for highly modular structures at the current time step , and the second minimizes the differences between community structures in the current and previous time steps .",
    "d - gt also uses a stochastic optimization procedure , but all of the agents individually optimize their utilities based on local network information .",
    "the markov cluster algorithm ( mcl )  @xcite identifies graph clusters by computing the probabilities of random walks through the graph ; flow simulations are performed by alternating expansion ( matrix squaring ) with inflation operations ( hadamard powers ) . due to its mathematical simplicity ,",
    "it is popular for community detection in many domains but is slow and often overestimates the number of communities in the dataset .",
    "regularized - mcl  @xcite is a variant of mcl that prevents overfitting by taking into account neighbor flows .",
    "it can also be used within a multi - level framework ( multi - level regularized mcl ) to speed up computation by executing a sequence of coarsening operations on the graph before executing r - mcl .",
    "labelrankt  @xcite , shares some similarities with the mcl techniques described above while improving upon them in several ways ; it is a label propagation approach in which the inflation operation is applied to the label distribution matrix rather than to the adjacency matrix .",
    "each node requires only local information during propagation making it more scalable than mcl and amenable to parallelization .",
    "due to labelrankt s strong performance and good implementation , it was selected as the best label propagation benchmark for our work .    our proposed method ( d - gt ) attempts to simulate the decision - making process of the individuals creating the communities , rather than focusing on statistical correlations between labels of neighboring nodes .",
    "we believe that exploiting game theory for dynamic community detection yields more realistic , fine - grained communities since intrinsically game theory is a good representation for expressing the behavior of individuals and strategic interactions among them  @xcite .    in previous work",
    ", we have demonstrated the success of game - theoretic approaches in static community detection across several domains , including detecting guilds in massively multiplayer online games  @xcite and predicting trust between users on e - commerce sites @xcite .",
    "many of these domains featured overlapping communities in static networks  @xcite ; however in this article the datasets are dynamic , but not overlapping .",
    "d - gt makes a hard assignment at the termination of the stochastic optimization procedure by selecting the community assignment with the highest utility function . in this article",
    ", we investigate the performance of different gain functions and initialization procedures , on a variety of evaluation metrics ( modularity , nmi , number of detected communities ) .",
    "the strength of the d - gt framework is its versatility ; our results show that substantial performance improvements can be achieved by customizing it for the problem at hand .",
    "first , we provide the formal definition of the problem and the notations used throughout the paper . given snapshots @xmath1 of a dynamic network and their corresponding underlying graphs @xmath2 , with @xmath3 vertices and @xmath4 edges , where t=1, ... ,m , we aim to detect community structure @xmath5 of the network .",
    "table  [ tb : symb ] shows the symbols and definitions used throughout the paper .",
    "we leverage a dynamic agent - based model to detect communities by optimizing each user s utility through a stochastic search process  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we evaluate four different variants of the procedure : d - gt ( * * d**ynamic * * g**ame * * t**heoretic community detection ) , d - gtp ( * d - gt * with passing one * * p**revious snapshot ) d - gts ( * d - gt * with * * s**eparate runs ) and d - gtg ( * d - gt * with passing * * g**round truth ) .",
    "[ tb : symb ]    .definition of symbols . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tb : runtime ] shows the running time of all algorithms on our largest datasets , the as - internet dataset ( with the highest number of snapshots ) and hep - ph ( with the highest number of nodes ) .",
    "overall , the running times provided by all algorithms were quite reasonable , as there are 733 snapshots in the internet dataset and over 10,000 and 30,000 nodes in oregon and hep - ph respectively .",
    "infomap is the fastest algorithm on two datasets ( internet and hep - ph ) and performs almost as well as oslom on third one ( oregon ) .",
    "all of the algorithms are sufficiently fast to run on large datasets .",
    "this article analyzes the performance of our game theoretic community detection algorithm , d - gt , on dynamic social networks .",
    "these social networks are very common in massively multiplayer online games , such as travian , where players self - organize into rapidly changing guilds and alliances .",
    "we show that d - gt s initialization procedure in combination with the similarity gain function is very effective at recovering the true community structure of the network , both in terms of predicting the number of communities and the players community membership vectors .",
    "it outperforms other dynamic community detection methods including labelrankt , ilcd , and oslom . in cases where the communities of a small number of players ( e.g. the guild leadership )",
    "is known d - gt can leverage the information to improve the nmi performance .",
    "when simply optimizing modularity , considering earlier community membership is less important and static community detection algorithms ( infomap and louvain ) perform well at this task , but all variants of d - gt offer competitive performance .",
    "one nice aspect of d - gt is that it is an easily extensible framework . in future work",
    "we plan to experiment with other utility functions , loss functions , and update rules ; for instance , q - learning could be used as the update rule for the agents instead of the community membership game .",
    "we also believe that it is feasible to reduce the runtime of d - gt by creating approximate versions of the gain function that can be calculated based on local edge updates .",
    "we would like to thank drs .",
