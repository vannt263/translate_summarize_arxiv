    "rapid development of quantum technologies implies that large networks operating with quantum information are to be created in the nearest future @xcite .",
    "such quantum networks are superior to their classical ancestors in security @xcite and efficiency of communication @xcite and exhibit new structures @xcite and behavior @xcite , which may be exploited in quantum computation @xcite and metrology @xcite . in general , a network is represented by a graph with nodes connected by links . in quantum networks ,",
    "the links are often associated with quantum channels , through which the nodes exchange photons @xcite .",
    "the photons may be locally measured with subsequent classical communication of the results of the measurements between the nodes .    for efficient communication in a quantum network with certain configuration of nodes and links , perfect long - distance entanglement between arbitrary nodes",
    "is to be established . as originally suggested by acin , cirac and lewenstein @xcite , methods of classical percolation theory @xcite can be employed to find the best strategy for entanglement distribution in a network of particular configuration leading to the notion of classical entanglement percolation . within this notion",
    "the communication capacity of a network is described by its percolation transition point , before which the probability to establish a path of perfect entanglement links between two remote nodes is exponentially small , while this probability has a finite asymptotic limit right after it .",
    "since each network configuration relates to the transition point , classical entanglement percolation imposes the fundamental limit on the communication capacity of the network .",
    "this limit can be overcame by global change of the network configuration with local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , by implementing locc on a fraction of selected nodes of the network of initial configuration , such as a honeycomb lattice , one may redistribute the entanglement between the nodes of a network of final configuration , e.g. triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "this quantum network reconfiguration reduces the percolation transition point making quantum communication possible at large scale even with initially insufficient amount of distributed entanglement .",
    "the price for this advantage is that the selected nodes become disconnected from the network of final configuration . in other words ,",
    "the selected nodes of the initial network must sacrifice their connectivity for communication benefit of the final network . from communication viewpoint , this may not be always appreciated at large scale and especially by the selected nodes .",
    "in addition , such a strategy can not be implemented on a network of arbitrary initial configuration . for example , given a triangular lattice or a 1d chain there is no way to execute the above procedure .",
    "here we suggest a different approach to overcome the limitations of the classical entanglement percolation .",
    "we employ locc to create complex quantum networks with new percolation properties on networks of simple initial configuration .",
    "our approach is based on multiple applications of locc and is free of sacrificing nodes of the initial network .",
    "we show , in particular , that the simplest 1d quantum network with the percolation transition point at unity , can be modified to the complex so - called hierarchical network @xcite with the transition point at @xmath0 using at most polynomial number of locc . in the following section",
    "we show first how to transform the 1d chain into the hierarchical network using locc .",
    "then , we give an account on physical resources required for the transformation in section  [ sec:3 ] and conclude in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "let us consider a 1d chain , where nodes are placed on a line at fixed distances from each other and are connected by channels .",
    "two neighboring nodes may exchange photons through the channels and thus share pure entangled states of qubits , which may be written in the computational basis @xcite as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the schmidt coefficients conditioned by @xmath4 and @xmath5 . a perfect entangled pair with @xmath6",
    "can be converted from the above state with the singlet conversion probability @xmath7 by measurement of one of the qubits from the pair with operators @xcite @xmath8    in quantum communication the singlet conversion probability plays the exact role of link occupation probability in percolation theory .",
    "indeed , if the imperfect entangled pairs are distributed between the nodes of a quantum network , each of the pairs is converted to the perfect entanglement link with probability @xmath9 or vanish with probability @xmath10 . by analogy with the percolation theory , we say that perfect entanglement is established between two remote nodes if there is a path of connected perfect entanglement links between the nodes .",
    "while the singlet conversion probability is a natural choice to study the entanglement percolation , we shall also use another measure of entanglement to characterize the process of entanglement distribution  the concurrence @xcite .",
    "the concurrence for the entangled qubit pair ( [ states ] ) is given by @xmath11 .",
    "perfect entanglement with concurrence @xmath12 is established between two distant nodes if only there is a path of connected entanglement links of concurrence @xmath12 each",
    ".     leads to the creation of a non - local entanglement link connecting two physically disconnected nodes . ]",
    "the main ingredient for the advanced quantum information processing is the entanglement swapping @xcite . if three nodes @xmath13 are chained together and the node @xmath14 shares two qubit pairs in state ( [ states ] ) with the neighbors , the optimal entanglement swapping @xcite consists of the measurement of the two qubits from the two different entangled pairs at node @xmath14 in the bell basis @xmath15 \\ket{\\phi^{\\pm } } & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left ( \\ket{01 } \\pm \\ket{10 } \\right ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with subsequent classical communication of the results of the measurement to nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see fig .

    "let each pair of neighboring nodes initially share @xmath27 qubit pairs in the state ( [ states ] ) .",
    "let us take @xmath28 qubit pairs and perform entanglement swapping at each second node .",
    "after that we take @xmath29 qubit pairs and apply the entanglement swapping at each third node . repeating the above procedure with the entanglement swapping at @xmath30 nodes for @xmath31",
    ", we construct @xmath28 levels of hierarchy of non - local entanglement links over the initial 1d chain formed with local links , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "this hierarchical network was introduced by boettcher , goncalves and guclu @xcite to study the behavior of the so - called small - world systems @xcite .",
    "but , because the non - local entanglement links are created with locc only and do not require any non - local interactions between the nodes , they can not be attributed to the small - world links in a common classical sense .",
    "moreover , the non - local links do nt correspond to physical communication channels : the physical connectivity of the chain is still one - dimensional .",
    "thus , created hierarchical network of entanglement links has no classical analog and may be called a genuine quantum network constructed on a 1d chain , while the entanglement percolation in such a network  the quantum entanglement percolation .",
    "the suggested approach demands creating non - local entanglement links beyond the given network configuration and can not be implemented classically .",
    "now , we show that quantum entanglement percolation in the hierarchical quantum network is of exponential benefit over the entanglement percolation in 1d chain . in the 1d chain with",
    "@xmath27 entangled pairs between to neighboring nodes , perfect entanglement between two neighboring nodes is established with probability @xmath32 . the condition for connecting two infinitely distant nodes with a perfect entanglement link reads as @xmath33 where @xmath26 is the number of nodes between the nodes to be connected .",
    "the condition holds true only for @xmath34 giving us the well - known percolation transition point in the classical 1d chain @xmath35 , i.e. in 1d configuration the perfect entanglement can be created between two infinitely distant nodes if only the perfect entanglement is established between each pair of neighboring nodes .    for the quantum hierarchical network ,",
    "the probability to connect two neighboring nodes is @xmath36 , while for three nodes @xmath37 , where we used the fact that the entanglement swapping does nt change the singlet conversion probability .",
    "taking into account self - similarity of the chain , we arrive to the recursive formula to find the probability of connecting the border nodes with a path of perfect entangled pairs @xcite @xmath38 for @xmath31 . in the infinite chain @xmath39 , thus @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the quadratic equation has two solutions interconnected at the non - classical percolation transition point @xmath42 .",
    "it is important to stress that , in contrast to standard percolation @xcite , before the percolation transition point @xmath43 there is a finite probability of connecting the border nodes @xmath44 .",
    "however , further analysis @xcite shows , that the probability to connect an arbitrary two nodes of the network with a path of perfect entanglement links is still exponentially small due to exponentially small size of the giant component with respect to the network size . for @xmath45",
    "a path between arbitrary two nodes in the network exists with a finite probability @xcite .",
    "thus the initially distributed entangled states ( [ states ] ) in the hierarchical network with the singlet conversion probability of @xmath46 are sufficient to establish a path of perfect entanglement links between arbitrary two nodes irrespective of the chain length .",
    "taking into account that in the 1d chain the perfect entanglement path exists only if @xmath47 ( and otherwise @xmath48 ) , for any @xmath45 quantum entanglement percolation is superior exponentially to the classical entanglement percolation as was announced .    in eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) we implicitly assumed that the average singlet conversion probability does nt change after multiple entanglement swapping operations .",
    "but , this is not the case , because after a single entanglement swapping with the bell measurements ( [ bell - measurements ] ) , the pure state ( [ bell - measurements ] ) transforms into a mixture of states ( [ final - swapping-1 ] ) and ( [ final - swapping-2 ] ) .",
    "further application of the entanglement swapping on the mixed state leads to the decrease of the average singlet conversion probability .",
    "since the entanglement swapping is a locc and the entanglement does nt increase under locc , there must be an optimal measurement that preserves the entanglement under multiple application of the entanglement swapping .",
    "but , as the optimal measurement is unknown yet @xcite , in the next section we shall estimate the amount of initial entangled pairs ( [ states ] ) and number of simple entanglement swapping operations with the bell measurements ( [ bell - measurements ] ) to create the hierarchical network on the 1d chain .",
    "before we proceed with the percolation properties of the quantum network , we would like to stress that each of the @xmath28 levels of hierarchy connects @xmath49 nodes into loops with one entangled link between the border nodes .",
    "thus to construct a network of maximal hierarchy on @xmath26 nodes ( i.e. to connect the border nodes with a single entanglement link ) one needs to distribute initially at least @xmath50 imperfect entangled pairs between each pair of neighboring nodes in the initial 1d chain .",
    "the total number of the imperfect entangled states in the hierarchical network of @xmath26 nodes thus scales as @xmath51 , which is practically feasible .",
    "studying the quantum entanglement percolation with concurrence gives us further insight into the process of entanglement distribution in the quantum network . because single entanglement swapping reduces the concurrence of the initial states @xmath52 times , the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) is modified as @xmath53 where @xmath54 . because @xmath55 as @xmath56 , the percolation properties of the hierarchical network reduce to the percolation properties of the classical 1d chain @xmath57 with the classical percolation transition point at @xmath58 .",
    "the reason for the reduction is the decay of entanglement in the non - local entanglement links of higher hierarchy due to multiple entanglement swapping .",
    "the decay is exponential with respect to the hierarchy level @xmath28 , which implies polynomial decay of entanglement with respect to the chain length @xmath26 , because @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the effect of the polynomial decay of entanglement can be eliminated using standard protocol for entanglement distillation @xcite .",
    "reminding that any two - qubit state is distillable if entangled @xcite , let us estimate the amount of initial entanglement to implement the distillation in the hierarchical network .",
    "let us consider the initial network configuration with @xmath27 entangled pairs between the neighboring nodes and assuming that all qubit pairs ( [ states ] ) have the amount of entanglement of @xmath61 , which corresponds to the states with schmidt coefficients @xmath62 .",
    "these states could be unitary transformed into werner states @xcite with fidelity of the each of the states @xmath63 . a single entanglement swapping at an arbitrary node of the 1d chain results into one of the two states ( [ final - swapping-1])-([final - swapping-2 ] ) . while the state ( [ final - swapping-2 ] ) requires no distillation , the fidelity of the state ( [ final - swapping-1 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath64 .",
    "using the iterative formula for the entanglement distillation @xmath65 we find that @xmath66 , i.e. the entanglement distillation protocol allows to restore the fidelity to the level before the entanglement swapping in just eight iterations .",
    "taking into account that the success probability of the distillation protocol approximates @xmath67 , @xmath68 entangled pairs are required to distill a single entanglement link after an entanglement swapping . in a network with @xmath28 levels of hierarchy , the number of entangled pairs before distillation thus scales exponentially as @xmath69 , but because @xmath70 , the total number of initial states to construct the hierarchical network with the average concurrence @xmath71 per entanglement link scales just polynomially @xmath72 .",
    "the distillation procedure is efficient , because targets achieving states with non - unit fidelity @xmath73 at each entanglement link .",
    "if each entanglement link in the hierarchical quantum network has the average concurrence @xmath71 , the probability to establish a perfect entanglement path between two arbitrary distant nodes is strictly higher then zero as suggested by the percolation properties of the quantum network",
    ".    suggested distillation procedure is not optimal and is shown to demonstrate practically appropriate ( i.e. polynomial ) scaling of the initial resources with the network size .",
    "more advanced distillation protocols @xcite may lead to even better scaling . the optimal strategy for the entanglement distillation",
    "depends on the optimal strategy for the hierarchical network construction , which is unknown yet , as we mentioned early .",
    "we introduced quantum networks created with locc , which exhibit non - classical percolation properties and have quantum communication advantages over corresponding classical networks . using the notion of quantum entanglement percolation we showed how to establish long - distance perfect entanglement between arbitrary two nodes in 1d chain with imperfect entangled pairs .",
    "apart from the quantum communication benefits , we clearly demonstrated the distinction between the percolation properties of the physical network configuration ( composed of nodes and channels ) and the quantum network configuration ( consisting of nodes and entanglement links ) .",
    "we showed that the percolation properties of these networks are dramatically different , although they both correspond to the physical 1d configuration .",
    "this result suggests a study of structural complexity of entanglement graphs that can be simulated on a given quantum network @xcite .",
    "presented approach of constructing the non - local hierarchical levels on simple underlying classical networks can be extended beyond 1d network configuration @xcite .",
    "in particular , the 2d square lattice with the classical percolation transition point at @xmath74 can be modified to a hierarchical network with the percolation transition point at @xmath75 .",
    "general analysis of the hierarchical networks is , however , challenging and requires development of new theoretical and numerical tools .    the hierarchical networks exhibit property of explosive percolation @xcite  the sudden emergence of large - scale connectivity in a network @xcite .",
    "the fact that the hierarchical networks may be created and operated locally opens intriguing possibilities for experimental testing of the explosive percolation .    finally because the quantum networks exhibit new percolation transition points",
    ", we may expect all - new percolation properties , which may lead to the construction of new local theory of percolation in quantum networks with new unexpected technological applications ."
