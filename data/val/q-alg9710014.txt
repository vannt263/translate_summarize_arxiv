    "this means that a vector is the product of two spinors . using the usual definition of rotation by @xmath215",
    ", we see that rotation by @xmath215 does not change the sign of @xmath129 if @xmath205 is an integer , i.e. for scalars , vectors and other `` bosons '' . whilst @xmath129 changes sign under rotation of @xmath215 for @xmath205 a half integer , i.e. for spinors fields and other `` fermions '' .",
    "an alternative way to define spinor fields is as the set @xmath216 this is decomposed into @xmath217 corresponding to the eigenspaces of @xmath218 , which is now regarded as the chirality operator .",
    "this interpretation is now equivalent to the one proposed by grosse et al @xcite , who go on to define and solve the dirac equation .",
    "we note that @xmath219 is not equivalent to simply two copies of @xmath220 , but a proper subset .",
    "this is because the element @xmath221 . in the commutative limit @xmath56",
    "we can obtain the standard spinors on a sphere .",

    "one can also consider the noncommutative supersphere , which is a representation of the superalgebra @xmath223 . thus one can study possible analogies of the dirac operator .",
    "it was possible to give a noncommutative version of the sphere because it was a co - adjoint orbit . by using other groups one could extend these results to higher dimensional compact co - adjoint orbits .",
    "one could consider the algebra generated by the quotienting the enveloping algebra of a lie algebra by the set of equations equivalent to the casimirs . as a long term goal one must consider noncommutative analogous of non co - adjoint orbits .      the work by madore @xcite and coquereaux @xcite examine an algebraic definition connection which can be used in noncommutative geometry .",
    "it requires simply that the vector space of vector fields is a module over the space of functions .",
    "this is the case in ( [ dg_vec_s2 ] ) .",
    "by combining ( [ dg_fn_kah ] ) and ( [ dg_fn_lob ] ) we can generate an algebra for the 4 dimensional de - sitter space .",
    "this would give this spacetime a natural cellular structure and enable one to study scalar fields on this space .",
    "the jordan - schwinger algebra can be generated for any lie algebra .",
    "it may be possible therefore to extend the results of ( [ dg_vec_s2 ] ) to generate an algebra for spinors and vector fields on the 4 dimensional de - sitter space .",
    "since this will enable one to look at spinor and vector fields on a space with a natural cellular structure , it might give an alternative method of renormalisation .",
    "klimek and lesniewski @xcite have recently given an outline of how one can create noncommutative analogues of 2-dimensional manifolds with genus greater than 2 .",
    "they use the noncommutative disc , so any new results for that should be useful ."
