    "semiconductors alloys are widely used as an active material in a variety of optoelectronic applications , such as lasers , solar cells , light - emitting diodes ( led s ) , and photodetectors @xcite .",
    "examples of group - iii - v materials that are actively studied include dilute bismides ga(asbi ) @xcite , dilute nitrides ( gain)(nas ) @xcite , and group - iii nitrides ( algain)n @xcite .",
    "mixing of semiconductors enables tuning of their optical properties , lattice parameters ( epitaxial strain ) , and transport characteristics to a desired application .",
    "examples include 1.55  @xmath0 m emission wavelength in the telecommunications industry , the visible spectrum for general lighting , an ultraviolet range of wavelengths for disinfecting water , or a multi - junction monolithic solar cell with 1  ev absorption edge .",
    "properties of the solid solutions often deviate from vegard s law , i.e. , can not be represented as a linear interpolation between properties of the constituents .",
    "alloying elements perturb the electronic structure of the host material , that may introduce traps , which affect optical and transport characteristics .",
    "for instance , a band gap bowing @xcite and a broadening of the photoluminescence ( pl ) line width in dilute nitride semiconductors @xcite , or drastic decrease of the hole mobility in dilute bismides @xcite are attributed to band tails , which originate from the spatially localized states created by isoelectronic substitutional impurities of individual n or bi as well as their clusters in gaas host @xcite .",
    "localization of electronic states can detrimentally affect performance of devices , which should be taken into account when selecting alloying elements . in the case of solar cells ,",
    "high mobility is desired for the efficient transport of photogenerated carriers to electrodes .",
    "the presence of band tails leads to inhomogeneous broadening of the gain spectrum causing reduction of the peak value of intensity gain ( ref .",
    ", pp.221223 ) . on the other hand",
    ", a wide photoluminescence line width can be a desired attribute in the case of ultraviolet light sources for water purification @xcite or a general - purpose led lighting @xcite .",
    "electronic structure calculations are widely used to explore parameter space @xcite and aid in quantifying the disorder introduced into a system by isoelectronic substitutional impurities .",
    "for example , gap : n , gaas : bi , and gan : as exhibit strong spatial localization of wave functions associated with impurity states near to the band edges @xcite .",
    "examining of a three - dimensional charge density distribution associated with an electronic state in an alloy provides some information about the extent of localization , but lacks a quantitative criterion that distinguishes between localized and delocalized states .",
    "@xcite originally proposed a localization parameter as a sum of probabilities @xmath1 of finding an electron in a specific eigenstate @xmath2 in the vicinity of atomic sites @xmath3 of the same element type .",
    "@xcite adapted this approach to a single impurity , e.g. , gaas:_x _ , and defined a localization ratio as the ratio of the wave function probability amplitude at the impurity site @xmath4 relative to the element it is substituted for in the host lattice @xmath5 the stronger the localization is , the higher the ratio ; the ratio of zero corresponds to no spatial perturbations of the electronic state .",
    "the magnitude of the ratio can be used to assess the relative impact of various impurities on the band edges of the host .",
    "however , generalization of this approach to an _ arbitrary _ state in an alloy is not straightforward due to the lack of a  reference \" state .",
    "localization in alloys can be defined as a vanishing zero - temperature d.c .",
    "conductivity in the system ( the absence of diffusion in the @xcite model ) . the value of conductivity as a function of the fermi energy provides a spectral measure of localization .",
    "however , its calculation from first principles is a cumbersome process .",
    "instead , @xcite suggested the second moment of the wave function probability amplitude , i.e. , the participation ratio ( pr ) @xmath6 ^ 2}\\ ] ] as a criterion to distinguish between localized and extended states .",
    "the inverse value @xmath7 can be related to the probability of an electron to return to the same state after an infinite time interval @xcite and thus is ultimately linked to the transport properties .",
    "here we use both the localization ratio and the pr criteria to perform a comparative study of localization effects in group - iii - v semiconductors alloys .",
    "first , we characterize isovalent impurities of b , n , al , p , in , sb , tl , and bi in the host gaas .",
    "we will show that the localization strength of these impurities is governed by their born effective charges .",
    "the strength of localization also determines the ability of alloying elements to change the band gap and the relative alignment of the conduction and the valence band edges ( cbe and vbe ) , which is important for band gap engineering .",
    "additionally , formation enthalpies of the individual impurities are calculated and linked to challenges associated with the growth of corresponding alloys . finally , we compare disorder characteristics of various gain medium materials for 1.55  @xmath0 m lasers , including ga@xmath8in@xmath9as , dilute ga@xmath8in@xmath9as@xmath10n@xmath11sb@xmath12 and gaas@xmath8bi@xmath9 alloys as well as the hypotetical ga@xmath8b@xmath9as@xmath13bi@xmath11 compound alloys .",
    "the results of aforementioned calculations are related to established experimental trends in transport coefficients and pl characteristics of these alloys .",
    "the first - principles calculations were carried out using density functional theory @xcite ( dft ) and the linear augmented plane wave method implemented in the ` wien2k ` package version  14.2 @xcite .",

    "the product @xmath16 , which determines the accuracy of a plane wave expansion of the wave function , was used throughout the calculations .",
    "the lattice constants and the band structures of binary compounds ( table  [ table : b ] ) were calculated self - consistently using @xcite generalized gradient approximation ( gga - wc ) for the exchange correlation functional .",
    "the choice of exchange correlation functional was based on preliminary studies of the band structure of gaas @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : induced_gap](a ) shows the change of a band gap of gaas due to the single impurity , which correspond to an effective concentration of 1.6% in the 128-atom supercell .",
    "nitrogen is by far the most effective alloying element from the band gap reduction point of view , followed by bi , b , and sb .",
    "the band gap reduction occurs by either lowering the conduction band or shifting up the valence band edge , depending on which band edge is primarily affected by the disorder ( fig .",
    "[ fig : induced_gap],b ) .",
    "it is the conduction band for n and b , and conversely the valence band for bi and tl ( see table  [ table : d ] ) .",
    "these general results are consistent with known trends for dilute nitrides @xcite and bismides @xcite .",
    "this information is relevant for the band gap engineering in semiconductor heterostructures , where the quantum carrier confinement is a design parameter .",
    "the practical implementation of compound semiconductor alloys is associated with challenges related to their formability .",
    "growth of metastable alloys is a complex process that is largely driven by kinetic effects at the surface , rather than by thermodynamic potentials of the bulk material .",
    "a notable example is the incorporation of bi or n in gaas that is possible to achieve experimentally at a level , which exceeds their predicted solubility by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "although , the defect formation enthalphy presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : formation ] can not be directly related to the solubility , it can still serve as a guideline for evaluating formability of alloys .",
    "based on these data , one would expect the growth of dilute borides to pose more challenges than thallides or bismides .",
    "the energy penalty associated with incorporation of nitrogen in gaas is at an intermediate level among other group - iii - v elements .",
    "these results can be understood as an interplay between the chemical bond and local strain energies .",
    "the formation enthalpy of bas is @xmath19  ev@xcite per formula unit , as compared to @xmath20  ev@xcite for gan . as a result , the strain energy due to the size mismatch between n and as is partly compensated by the strong ga - n bond , which is not the case for the b - as bond .",
    "the incorporation of tl and bi in gaas is hindered due to the same reason .",
    "it is instructive to note that the energy penalty associated with incorporation of group - iii - v element in gaas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : formation ] ) is not always leveraged through the efficient band gap reduction or the effective quantum confinement engineering for semiconducting heterostructures ( fig .  [",

    "we begin with the in@xmath23ga@xmath24as alloy , which represents the fist generation of gain materials .",
    "the effective band structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a](a ) .",
    "the calculated band gap of 0.79  ev agrees well with the targeted emission wavelength .",
    "the bloch character is well preserved in the vicinity of the band edges and persists approximately 0.5  ev into the bands .",
    "the light and heavy hole bands as well as the split - off band are clearly resolved on the unfolded band structure .",
    "the conduction band at the l - valley is energetically well isolated from the @xmath25-valley that prevents spurious interactions and mixing between these states in the alloy .    the above noted features of the effective alloy band structure",
    "are consistent with the narrow low - temperature pl line width ( @xmath26  mev , ref .  ) , the high mobility of electrons ( @xmath27  @xmath28v@xmath29s@xmath29 , refs .  ) and holes ( @xmath30  @xmath28v@xmath29s@xmath29 , refs .  ) observed experimentally in in@xmath31ga@xmath8as with @xmath32 . the low value of the localization ratio ( @xmath33 ) for gaas : in impurities is consistent with these observations .",

    "states with a higher excess kinetic energy in the valence and conduction bands show a slight increase of the pr , in particular in the conduction band when the energy approaches the l - valley ( @xmath35  ev ) .",
    "these states do not contribute to inhomogeneous broadening of the optical gain and do not hamper the charge carrier transport coefficients .",

    "the cbe has drastically changed from ( inga)as .",
    "the retention of its @xmath25-character is only about 50% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a],b ) , which is accompanied by the abrupt increase of the pr ( i.e. , localization ) within the conduction band and near to the edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e],b ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the strength of localization in the conduction band _ increases _ with increasing the electron excess energy , contrary to the common view based on the classical anderson model of localization .",
    "this observation is consistent with the low bloch character ( less than 30% ) for states within the energy window @xmath49  ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a],b ) .",
    "these features of the electronic structure of dilute nitrides lead to broadening of the pl line width ( @xmath50  mev , refs .  ) and reduction of the electron mobility ( 100  @xmath28v@xmath29s@xmath29 , ref .  ) , whereas the hole mobility remains unaffected ( 900  @xmath28v@xmath29s@xmath29 , ref .  ) .",
    "these observations also conform with the single impurity ( gaas : n and gaas : sb ) localization studies presented in the preceding subsection .",
    "one can anticipate a detrimental impact of localization at the cbe on the optical gain in this material system .",
    "the reason for an intrinsic  disorder penalty \" is twofold : ( i ) smearing of the bloch character impedes the k - selection rules for the optical transition and reduces the dipole matrix element , ( ii ) the inhomogeneous broadening reduces the gain .    *",
    "gaas@xmath51bi@xmath52 * :  we now turn to the third generation of the gain materials , namely dilute bismide gaas@xmath8bi@xmath9 alloys .",
    "their development is inspired by a potential ability to reduce the auger losses @xcite .",
    "the bismuth content of @xmath53 was selected to match the anticipated band gap with the emission wavelength of 1.55  @xmath0 m @xcite .",

    "contrary to the dilute nitrides , the bismides demonstrate a well defined profile in the conduction band , whereas the valence band is severely distorted @xcite .",
    "the conduction band minimum is well resolved with a strong @xmath25-character without a noticeable mixing with l- and x - states .",
    "the split - off band is located at 0.77  ev below the valence band edge . at such a high bismuth content ,",
    "the spin - orbit splitting becomes greater than the band gap ( @xmath54  ev in our case ) , which is desired for suppression of the auger recombination . in both material systems ( inga)as and ( gain)(nassb ) , which were studied above , this condition is far from being fulfilled .",
    "the heavy and light hole degeneracy lift at the @xmath25-point in fig .",
    "[ fig : a](c ) is an artifact caused by the strain induced by a linear chain of bi atoms favoured by the sqs algorithm .",
    "the degeneracy at the top of the valence band re - appeared in the structure with a more uniform distribution of bi atoms ( not shown here ) .",
    "examining the localization effects in gaas@xmath41bi@xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e],c ) we discern that states at the valence band edge have a significantly stronger localization as compared to ( inga)as and ( gain)(nassb ) alloys .",
    "the pr at the vbe of gaas@xmath41bi@xmath42 exceeds the pr at the cbe of the ( gain)(nassb ) alloy by approximately a factor of two .",
    "these results explain further broadening of the low - temperature pl line width of ga(asbi ) alloys ( @xmath55  mev , refs .  ) and the steep decline of the hole mobility ( @xmath56  @xmath28v@xmath29s@xmath29 ,  refs .  ) .",
    "the stronger localization effects are likely to be an intrinsic property of dilute ga(asbi ) alloys , even though the localization in gaas : bi is less pronounced at the single impurity level than in gaas : n ( @xmath57 , see table  [ table : d ] ) . the enhanced localization in dilute bismides can be attributed to the much higher concentration of bismuth , which is required to achieve the same band gap reduction as in dilute nitrides .",
    "accordingly , the alloy statistics leads to a higher probability of forming pairs ( bi - ga - bi ) and higher order clusters , which have a detrimental effect on the electronic structure at the vbe @xcite .",
    "the above discussion of the  disorder penalty \" and its impact on gain characteristics is fully applicable to the ga(asbi ) material system .",
    "the disorder also has implications on optical losses .",
    "the auger recombination is a many - particle process , the likelihood of which is determined by the energy and momentum ( wave vector ) conservation of the electronic states involved . in materials with strong disorder , the momentum conservation requirement is relaxed due to uncertainties of the wave vector @xmath58 inherent to localized states .",
    "therefore , the inferred reduction of auger losses in ga(asbi ) gain media requires a thorough analysis , which will take into account the realistic band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a](c ) and the presence of alloy disorder .    * ga@xmath59b@xmath60as@xmath51bi@xmath52 * :",
    "finally , we would like to comment of quaternary bismide alloys .",
    "for instance , ga(nasbi ) material system @xcite offers an additional flexibility in engineering of the lattice mismatch and/or band offsets .",
    "here we studied a ga@xmath43b@xmath44as@xmath41bi@xmath42 alloy , which was inspired by the physics of in - n bonds in ( gain)(nas ) @xcite .",
    "one would expect that the incorporation of boron will further reduce the band gap and help to mitigate the local strain fields by forming b - bi bonds ( a correlated alloy ) .",
    "in contrast , the addition of boron results in an upward shift of the @xmath25-valley of the conduction band and opening of the band gap ( fig .  [",
    "fig : a],d ) .",
    "this result suggests that the properties of quaternary alloys are governed by more complicated physics than a simple additive effects of ternary compounds .",
    "the positive effect of boron is an improvement of the bloch character of the vbe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a],d ) in comparison to the boron - free alloy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a],c ) .",
    "the improvement is also seen in reduction of the pr at the vbe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e],d ) .",
    "however , there are two drawbacks : ( i ) a more severe localization develops in the conduction band and deeper energy states in the valence band , ( ii ) the incorporation of boron in a gaas lattice can be challenging due to the high defect formation energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : formation ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , ( gab)(asbi ) could be an alternative material system for multijunction solar cells with 1  ev band gap and lattice matched to gaas .",
    "dft calculations were used to perform a systematic characterization of isovalent impurities ( b , n , al , p , in , sb , tl , and bi ) in the host gaas .",
    "the degree of localization present in electronic states near to the band edges decreases in the following order : n , bi , b , tl , and sb . other elements do not cause notable localization of the electronic states .",
    "the localization strength scales with the born effective charge , which was calculated for individual impurities .",
    "the effective charge of impurities can be markedly different from their nominal values in binary compounds reflecting their electropositive / electronegative nature in the specific host lattice .",
    "elements , which have the born effective charge less than the host , introduce localized states in the conduction band but do not perturb the valence band edge , and vice versa .",
    "the extremity of localization at the band edges directly correlates with several important characteristics , such as the charge carrier transport , broadening of the photoluminescence spectra , the ability of individual elements to change the band gap and the relative band alignment .",
    "an extensive comparison with experimental data gives confidence in the predictive power of first - principle calculations .",
    "the energy penalty associated with incorporation of impurities in the host lattice does not follow the localization pattern and decreases in the following order : b , tl , bi , n , and sb .",
    "this result implies that the growth of dilute borides poses more challenges than thallides or bismides .",
    "the incorporation of nitrogen in gaas is assisted by the strong ga - n bond .",
    "we performed a comparative study of localization in ( inga)as , ( gain)(nassb ) and ga(asbi ) compound alloys , which represent three generations of material systems for telecommunication lasers .",
    "a wavefunction participation ratio calculated for individual eigenstates was used as a measure for the extremity of localization .",
    "the results indicate that the electronic structure of ( inga)as is least affected by the alloy disorder .",
    "the electronic states near to the conduction band edge of ( gain)(nassb ) and the valence band edges of ga(asbi ) are strongly affected by the disorder .",
    "the extremity of localization at the valence band edge of ga(asbi ) is approximately twice greater than that for the conduction band edge of ( gain)(nassb ) .",
    "this result translates into an intrinsically higher inhomogeneous broadening inherent to dilute bismide alloys as compared to their dilute nitride counterparts , which can have an unfavorable impact on the optical gain characteristics and auger losses .",
    "this conclusion should not be extended to group - iii antimonide semiconductors alloyed with bi for mid - infrared devices .",
    "the smaller electronic difference between sb and bi should lead to a less detrimental impact of bi on the structure of ( algain)(sbbi ) according to the arguments presented above for single impurities .",
    "authors are thankful to axel van de walle and joseph zwanziger for helpful discussions regarding generation of quasi - random structures as well as to maciej polak for critical reading of the manuscript .",
