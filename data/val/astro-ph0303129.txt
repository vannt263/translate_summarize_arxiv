    "the most remarkable discovery from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) observation is a very early reionisation of the universe at @xmath3 ( bennett et al .",
    "the optical depth is @xmath4 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) indicated by the te cross power correlation function for low @xmath5 modes , or @xmath6 from a global fit including both te and tt power spectra ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that early reionisation is primarily due to uv light from early ob stars in protogalaxies ( couchman & rees 1986 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1994 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ; fukugita & kawasaki 1994 ; see loeb & barkana 2001 for reviews of the recent progress and further references ) .",
    "many calculations have been done with increasingly improved physical approximations ( see cen 2003 ; razoumov et al .",
    "2002 ; ciardi , ferrara & white 2003 for the most recent calculations ) .",
    "recent calculations are mostly based on @xmath7-body simulations to include many physical effects . with the cosmological parameters of @xmath2cdm models ,",
    "the reionisation epoch is inferred to be @xmath8 .",
    "although these estimates stand for the ` best estimates ' with elaborated simulations , there are some subtleties that may depend on specific assumptions , models of physical processes and meshes of numerical simulations . in this paper",
    "we study the _ earliest _ possible reionisation epoch in the @xmath2cdm scenario under the standard assumptions concerning star formation .",
    "namely , we consider the case when all energy from baryons that form stars are efficiently injected into the intergalactic medium . for this purpose",
    "it is appropriate to take a homogeneous multiphase universe model , where we reduce the detailed physics to a few parameters , which are constrained by empirical knowledge , or otherwise left as free parameters .",
    "the cosmological parameters are now well - constrained by virtue of wmap itself , together with advancement in optical observations : @xmath9 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( i.e. , the flat universe ) , @xmath13 ( spergel et al .",
    "the fluctuations show the spectrum close to flat , @xmath14 , with the amplitude normalisation @xmath15 .",
    "it seems that there is no much freedom to modify these parameters . the formation of structure is well described by the press schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "we assume that a constant fraction of baryons form stars once the perturbation is collapsed and the jeans and cooling conditions are satisfied .",
    "the maximally allowed baryon fraction that goes to stars is constrained by empirical metallicity of the universe .",
    "we assume the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , which shows a rather high weight for high mass stars , relative to scalo s imf ( scalo 1986 ) , although this choice is not essential to us under our empirical constraint from metallicity .",
    "we allow the fraction of uv that comes out of ob stars in protogalaxies to vary : the extreme case assumes a 100% escaping fraction .",
    "there are many effects that should be taken into account for more realistic reionisation history : inhomogeneity of star forming clouds , feedback from stars and expanding uv shell are obvious examples .",
    "the absorption due to galaxies and lyman alpha clouds are another .",
    "these effects all contribute to delay the reionisation epoch , so that the neglect of these effects are justified for the purpose to estimate the earliest reionisation epoch .",
    "we discuss , however , these physical effects later .",
    "we find that quasars are important only in the late epoch .",
    "so we switch off quasars for our calculation of the reionisation epoch .",
    "we follow the formalism given in fukugita & kawasaki ( 1994 ; hereafter fk ) .",
    "we solve the evolution equation for thermal history with uv from collapsed objects taken into account .",
    "we include the effect of heating to the jeans mass , although it is not very important",
    ". a full description of the basic formalism is found in fk . we give a brief description of our calculation and inputs that differ from fk in the next section .",
    "the number of collapsed objects within the mass range @xmath16 to @xmath17 at redshift @xmath18 , @xmath19 , is calculated by the press schechter formula with the threshold mass density @xmath20 .",
    "we take a flat ( @xmath21 ) spectrum and the transfer function given by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) including baryons .",
    "we take the high normalisation @xmath22 , allowed by the wmap result ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , but later show how the result depends on @xmath23 .",
    "the smearing is made with a top hat window function .",
    "we take cosmological parameters from the fit of wmapext+2dgrs ( with constant power spectrum ) in spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we assume that a constant fraction @xmath24 of baryons collapsed into bound objects form stars once the jeans condition @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the electron temperature , @xmath27 is the temperature of the cosmic background radiation and @xmath28 is the mean molecular weight , is satisfied , and the molecular cooling time is shorter than the dynamical time ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ) , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fraction of free electrons .",
    "molecules are fragile , and this condition may have to be replaced with the atomic cooling condition @xmath32k ( @xmath33 : virial temperature ) for a more realistic calculation ( stecher & williams 1967 ; haiman et al .",
    "the atomic cooling condition gives the lower bound on the galactic mass as @xmath34 but the results using this condition differ very little from those we obtained by setting the molecular cooling condition .",
    "we take the object with @xmath35<m$ ] or @xmath36<m$ ] as being collapsed .",
    "the cooling time becomes longer than the hubble time for low redshift @xmath37 , where compton cooling is not efficient , and galaxies do not form if @xmath38 @xmath39 being the metallicity ( blumenthal et al .",
    "the constant fraction @xmath24 may be estimated by the balance of the local infall rate and the cooling rate , which , however , may depend on the details of calculations ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1992 ) . here",
    "we simply constrain the @xmath24 parameter from the heavy element abundance to avoid uncertainties from the use of specific models .",
    "[ note that our @xmath24 is the fraction of baryons that form stars against collapsed baryons that satisfy cooling conditions , in contrast to the definition often taken in the literature that a similar number is defined by the ratio of baryons that satisfy the cooling conditions ( which equal baryons that form stars ) against those in collapsed objects . ]",
    "we assume that stars form according to the salpeter imf , @xmath40 .",
    "the temperature - mass relation ( bond , carr & hogan 1986 ) we adopt is @xmath41 \\label{eq : temp}\\ ] ] for population ii stars ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the coefficient is replaced with @xmath43k for population i stars ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "for @xmath45 we consider a mixture of the two populations to adjust the mean metalliciy . in principle",
    ", somewhat higher temperature is expected for so - called population iii stars , i.e. , stars from pristine gas , but the local environment of star forming region is quickly enriched once the first stars formed : so it is more appropriate to consider population ii stars here , assuming that star forming regions are not locally enriched after the first stars formed , the reionisation epoch is only slightly delayed ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , which are comapred to the numbers given in section 3 below ) .",
    "this results from the fact that the temperature of population iii stars is higher ( the coefficient of ( [ eq : temp ] ) being 10 ) , but the number of photons is fewer ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) , and these two effects counteract for reionisation ( the latter effect slightly wins ) ; the efficiency of reionisation is more importantly controlled by the energy generation rate , which is fixed by ( [ eq : eps - t ] ) . ] .",
    "the fraction of radiation energy produced , @xmath48 , and the time in the main - sequence , @xmath49 , are , respectively , ( bond , carr & hogan 1986 ) @xmath50 , \\cr          t_{\\rm ms } & = & 2.3\\times 10 ^ 6 { \\rm yr }          \\left({\\epsilon_s\\over0.0046 } \\right )          { \\rm max}\\left[\\left({m_s\\over 100m_\\odot}\\right)^{-2},1\\right ] , \\label{eq : eps - t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the hydrogen mass fraction . since the lifetime of massive main - sequence stars with @xmath52 , which are relevant to us , is shorter than the cosmic time for @xmath53 , we can assume that ionising photons are produced instantaneously upon the formation of stars .",
    "the production rate of uv photons with energy @xmath54 is given by @xmath55_{r , star }          & = &         \\int dm_s { b(\\varepsilon_\\gamma , t_s)\\over \\varepsilon_\\gamma }         \\epsilon_s \\phi(m_s){\\omega_b \\over \\omega_m }         \\nonumber\\\\         &   & \\times \\int dm m         \\left[{\\partial n(m , z)\\over \\partial z}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : ngamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the blackbody spectrum , normalised to @xmath57 .",
    "for simplicity of calculation we use the derivative of the press - schechter function @xmath7 , whilst being aware that it does not give the formation rate of collapsing objects when the destruction rate gives a negative contribution to the derivative of @xmath7 . at early epochs , @xmath58",
    ", however , this never happens for galactic scales or smaller scales ( kitayama & suto 1996 ) .",
    "thus , this does not introduce appreciable inaccuracies in the calculation of early reionisation .",
    "we follow the chemical evolution of the universe .",
    "stars with @xmath59 eject heavy elements at a fraction @xmath60 ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) .",
    "the evolution of heavy element is then @xmath61 .",
    "\\label{eq : metal}\\ ] ] we take @xmath62 as the limit for population i stars , which leads to @xmath63 .",
    "we then solve the coupled evolution equations for ionisation fraction of hydrogen and helium , @xmath64/dt$ ] , @xmath65/dt$ ] , @xmath66/dt$ ] , the photon spectrum @xmath67 and the electron temperature @xmath68/dt$ ] .",
    "we take all relevant atomic processes for heating and cooling .",
    "the explicit form of differential equations and necessary atomic physics are detailed in fk .",
    "we follow the thermal history from @xmath69 including the recombination epoch .",
    "the results of calculations are shown in figure 1 ( for hydrogen ) and in figure 2 ( for helium ) .",
    "the figure shows reionisation of hydrogen and excitation of helium i to ii at @xmath70 , taking 90% ionisation as the reionisation epoch .",
    "we define the thomson optical depth by @xmath71 , \\label{eq : thomson}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 the thomson cross section . here",
    ", we subtract the contribution to @xmath73 from residual ionisation of the standard recombination ( the second term in the integrand ) to evaluate only the effect of reionisation .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 .",
    "we consider that these @xmath75 and @xmath73 correspond to the earliest epoch of reionisation and the maximum optical depth we can obtain in the @xmath2cdm model with the specified cosmological parameters and with flat adiabatic fluctuations normalised to cosmic microwave background observations .",
    "the optical depth is consistent with the wmap result @xmath76 , but the reionisation epoch is later than @xmath77 the wmap team quoted , which assums instantaneous reionisation ( kogut et al .",
    "[ we note that @xmath78 often quoted by the wmap team ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ; kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) assumes a rather unusual reionisation history . ]",
    "the difference in @xmath75 comes from the fact that stars formed earlier than the reionisation epoch contribute to @xmath73 . although the hi fraction drops quite sharply at @xmath75 , there is a non - negligible contribution from early formation of stars at @xmath79 .",
    "if we integrate ( [ eq : thomson ] ) to z=13.5 , we obtain @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 comes from @xmath82 .",
    "note that first stars formed at @xmath83 , which is visible as a turn on of the hii component .",
    "this epoch is consistent among the authors who calculated reionisation with the cdm model ( see e.g. , loeb & barkana 2001 ) .    in our calculation",
    "we have ignored many physical effects , which always contribute to delay the reionisation .",
    "we have assumed as a default that all uv photons escape from galaxies .",
    "this is not realistic , but this fraction is poorly known observationally , ranging from @xmath8410% ( steidel et al .",
    "2001 ) to @xmath85% ( heckman et al .",
    "bianchi et al . ( 2001 ) argued @xmath86% from the lyman @xmath87 cloud abundance .",
    "this parameter may also depend on the size , and hence redshift , of objects we consider .",
    "we take this as a free parameter .",
    "if we assume an escaping fraction of ionising photons @xmath88% the epoch of reionisation is delayed to @xmath89 and @xmath80 , as we shall show below .",
    "we have assumed that stars form when the molecular cooling condition is satisfied . if the atomic cooling condition gives a more important epoch for first galaxies ( haiman et al .",
    "1997 ) , the epoch of reionisation is delayed , but our calculation shows it is only by @xmath90 , or @xmath91 .",
    "we have assumed the salpeter imf which gives a relatively large number of massive stars .",
    "the specific choice of this imf , however , results in little uncertainty , because we have set a parameter that controls star formation efficiency @xmath24 so that it gives empirically observed metallicity .",
    "since dominant metal production is due to massive stars , the change caused by a different choice of imf , say scalo s or top - heavy imf , is compensated by the change of the @xmath24 parameter .",
    "we note that our results depend not only on @xmath24 and @xmath92 , but also on other cosmological parameters , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and in particular on @xmath23 . to show sensitivity to various parameters we show in figure 3 the dependences of the reionisation epoch and the optical depth upon those parameters .",
    "the dependence on @xmath24 is identical to that on @xmath95 .",
    "the dependence of the reionisation epoch on @xmath93 , for example , arises from the fact that it controls the formation of small objects in early epochs , but on the other hand the decrease of the time interval for a unit redshift as increasing @xmath96 suppresses the increase of @xmath73 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath94 appears more non - trivial : as baryon density increases , recombination rate becomes faster , delaying reionisation .",
    "however , this effect is overcome by the increase of the baryon density , and @xmath73 increases .",
    "one may use this figure to compare our calculation with those that use different cosmological parameters .",
    "the other effects that must be taken into account for more realistic calculations are feedback from stars to suppress star formation and the absorption of ionising flux by hydrogen clouds and the envelope of galaxies .",
    "the former leads to a milder slope of the luminosity function compared with the dark matter mass function ( dekel & silk 1986 ; white & frenk 1991 ; nagamine et al .",
    "we studied the effect by artificially decreasing the net star formation rate for smaller objects so that the collapsed baryonic mass function obeys the form of an empirical schechter function at @xmath97 , assuming @xmath98constant .",
    "this suppresses the early star formation and the ionisation does not take place until @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this is probably an extreme case because a sharper faint end slope is expected in the luminosity function at a higher @xmath18 .",
    "the uv absorption by lyman alpha clouds and galaxies may delay reionisation .",
    "we developed a formalism to take account of envelope of galaxies and lyman @xmath87 clouds ( fukugita & kawasaki , in preparation ) .",
    "for an early epoch such as the one we are concerned with , this effect is negligible .",
    "the absorption due to galaxies becomes sizable only at low redshifts ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "adopting a minihalo model for lyman @xmath87 clouds ( ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ) , we find that absorption by lyman @xmath87 cloud is negligible for the ionisation epoch , because the onset of the ionising radiation decreases rapidly the abundance of lyman @xmath87 clouds .    the ionisation by quasars is important only for @xmath102 .",
    "recent sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) observations showed that early bright quasars form exponentially in @xmath18 ( fan et al .",
    "we estimate the early quasar population using the quasar luminosity function ( boyle et al .",
    "2000 ) known at lower redshifts , and put @xmath103_{\\rm qso}$ ] with the aid of the empirical spectrum ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) in the evolution equation .",
    "we find that quasars alone reionise the universe only at @xmath104 although the effect becomes recognisable at @xmath105 . in any case",
    "the contribution of quasars is negligible compared to ob stars in the early reionisation epoch .",
    "the uv flux from quasars is important to sustain a high degree of ionisation at lower redshifts , as envisaged by the gunn - peterson test , when the escaping fraction of uv from galaxies is less than @xmath106% .    in conclusion ,",
    "the earliest epoch of reionisation we obtained is @xmath107 with the cosmological parameters determined by wmap ( a value of 14 is possible within errors  for example with @xmath108 ) and the thomson optical depth is 0.17 .",
    "this is consistent with the reionisation wmap found .",
    "the difference in @xmath18 beweeen our value and wmap s is ascribed to different approximations : wmap assumed that the entire optical depth comes from @xmath109 , whereas the contribution earlier than @xmath110 is non - negligible in our calculation .",
    "the realistic uv escaping fraction and the feedback of stars may somewhat lower the optical depth and delay the recombination epoch .",
    "the uncertainty in imf that directly controls star formation is effectively absorbed into the @xmath24 parameter which is constrained by metallicity .",
    "we remark that reionisation takes place sharply once the number of ionising photons , which are determined by the thermal balance , reaches some critical number and so it is difficult to sustain a partial ionisation for an extended period , as was assumed in kogut et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    as the final comment our result is consistent with the salpeter imf case of ciardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who carried out a numerical simulation for the purpose similar to ours . as a check we calculated the case with @xmath108 , @xmath22 and @xmath111 , and we obtained the reionisation epoch of @xmath112 , which is compared to @xmath113 ( see fig .  3 of ciardi et al . ) .",
    "this small difference is probably ascribed to feedback effects of stars , as discussed above .",
