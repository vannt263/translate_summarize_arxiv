    "the connection between solvable potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) is an established fact @xcite .",
    "gendenshtein showed that whenever the special symmetry known as ` shape - invariance symmetry ' is satisfied by the supersymmteric partner potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the entire energy spectrum including eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian can be calculated by purely algebraic means @xcite .",
    "this idea has been illustrated for the full set of exactly solvable potentials @xcite .",
    "however , rather more interesting scenario is the existence of conditionally exactly solvable(ces ) and quasi conditionally exactly solvable potentials ( qces ) . in the first case ( ces )",
    ", the full energy spectrum can be obtained only when the parameters of the potential satisfy some particular condition .",
    "whereas for the second case ( qces ) , a part of the eigen spectrum can be calculated only when a certain parametric condition is satisfied .",
    "some of these potentials which belong to the second class are coulomb potential perturbed by terms of different powers of @xmath3 @xcite , anharmonic potential with quartic and sextic terms @xcite and the mixed potential @xcite which is the potential of our present study . in all these cases",
    "it has been demonstrated that the potential parameters can be chosen appropriately , such that exact analytic solution for the ground state of the potential can be obtained .",
    "+ in the present work , we revisit the mixed potential to establish the fact that a proper use of the conditional shape invariance symmetry is a very powerful tool to calculate analytically _ the whole eigen spectrum _ of the mixed potential .",
    "a number of investigations on this potential can be found in references @xcite , although none of them either established that the conditional shape invariance symmetry is responsible for occurrence of conditionally exact solution or calculated the whole spectrum .",
    "these earlier works have also not addressed the major issue of exploiting conditional shape invariance symmetry to get solution of higher excited states .",
    "thus our present work will address two key features .",
    "first , we will explicitly show that this particular potential , which is a member of the ces potential family , basically inherits the conditional shape invariance symmetry .",
    "second , we will utilize the ces symmetry in the hierarchy of hamiltonians which leads to the very accurate results even for the excited states for judicious choices of potential parameters .",
    "+ it is to be noted that numerical calculations of excited states for a given potential are more challenging , as they involve larger numerical errors due to the fact that the system becomes more extended as the excitation increases .",
    "thus our present methodology has the potential to be presented as an accurate alternative treatment for the calculation of higher excited states of ces potentials . for higher excited states of a given mixed potential",
    ", we will always look for the solution of the ground state of the next higher member in the hierarchy of hamiltonians .",
    "we will also show that the choice of parameters also plays a major role to get an accurate solution .",
    "we have compared our analytic results with the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation and discussed both the demerits and efficacy of our methodology .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec",
    "2.1 we present a brief introduction to the susy qm language for general readers . in sec 2.2 and sec 2.3 we discuss the mixed potential extensively . in sec 3",
    "we present the comparison of numerical results with analytically calculated results .",
    "sec 4 contains a summary followed by concluding remarks .",
    "to discuss the basics of susy formalism , we start with the susy hamiltonian in one dimension , which is given by @xmath4 where the original hamiltonian @xmath5 is factorized in two partner hamiltonian @xmath6 and @xmath7 . @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 are defined as @xmath8 where the original potential @xmath9",
    "is also factorized in two supersymmetric partner potentials @xmath10 .",
    "the partner potentials @xmath10 are represented through the well - known riccati equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is referred as the superpotential and is related to the ground state wave function @xmath13 of @xmath14 through @xmath15 it is to be noted that energy levels ( in the units of @xmath16 ) are shifted to make the ground state energy of @xmath6 zero .",
    "now in terms of generalized annihilation and creation operator @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are defined as @xmath19 the two partner hamiltonians can be written as @xmath20 using susy algebra , one can explicitly show the correspondence between energy levels of the two partner hamiltonians .",
    "let the eigenfunctions of @xmath21 , which correspond to eigenvalues @xmath22 be @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath24 similarly @xmath25    since @xmath26 , ground state of @xmath27 does not have a susy partner .",
    "so the pair of potential @xmath10 have the same eigenspectra , only the partner state corresponding to the ground state of @xmath28 is missing in the spectrum of @xmath29 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 .",
    "+ gendenshtein pointed out that the shape - invariance condition is mathematically expressed @xcite as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the two parameters appearing in the potential and @xmath34 is a prescription for getting @xmath35 from @xmath36 . to be similar in shape , the partner potentials must have same mathematical structure , but with altered parameters .",
    "it has been shown that this condition is an integrability condition @xcite and applying susy algebra for a hierarchy of hamiltonians along with this shape invariance condition , one obtains the full eigen - spectrum of @xmath14 as @xmath37 we will show that for ces potentials , the shape invariance criterion is satisfied only when a set of constraint conditions involving potential parameters is satisfied .      algebraic method of solving a shape invariant potential by forming a hierarchy of hamiltonians is well known and extensively used @xcite . here",
    ", we are going to show its effective use in case of a ces potential also .",
    "the form of the potential of our present interest is @xmath38 so to calculate the ground state , we take @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ground state energy of @xmath41 . here by following the conventional formalism of susy we have subtracted @xmath42 to make the ground state energy of @xmath43 zero and the riccati equation is defined accordingly .",
    "we choose our superpotential ansatz as @xmath44 now , @xmath45 is related with @xmath46 through the riccati equation as @xmath47 where @xmath48 comparing the coefficients of each power of @xmath3 from eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , the unknown parameters are calculated and we also get a constraint condition as number of potential parameters are larger than the numbers of superpotential parameters .",
    "the unknown parameters @xmath49 of the superpotential are related with potential parameters through the following equations @xmath50 the solutions of the above equations are @xmath51 then the ground state energy of @xmath41 is given by @xmath52 subject to the parametric constraint condition @xmath53 it is evident from the above discussion that not all the potential parameters can be chosen freely as the constraint condition regarding potential parameters has to be satisfied .",
    "now , a feature of conditional shape invariant potential is that the number of potential parameters are generally larger than the number of superpotential parameters .",
    "so there is a constraint condition relating potential parameters ( eq . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 as free parameters and then @xmath57 is calculated from the constraint condition and calculated values of @xmath57 are presented in table 2 for different sets of potential parameters . + now to check the shape invariance property of @xmath45 we construct the susy partner potential @xmath58 as @xmath59 again the functional relation between parameters of @xmath60 and @xmath46 can be calculated by comparing the coefficients of different powers of @xmath3 .",
    "the calculation reveals that @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 remain same as their functional dependences with respective superpotential parameters remain unchanged , although @xmath54 has been changed to @xmath61 while @xmath61 is determined by @xmath62 from the structure of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , it can be shown that the new parameter ( @xmath61 ) is related with the old parameter ( @xmath54 ) by translation as @xmath63 thus @xmath54 is translated to @xmath64 during the passage of @xmath65 and @xmath66 is determined through the relation @xmath67 + next , we carry forward this technique to the calculation of excited states of @xmath41 . as @xmath43 and @xmath60 are the two partner potentials , they maintain the energy degeneracy relation and ground state of @xmath60 is nothing but the first excited states of @xmath43 .",
    "now to calculate the ground state of @xmath60 , we start from @xmath60 as the new starting potential and define @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 is the ground state energy of @xmath70 , we shift the energy scale again by @xmath69 , so that its ground state is at zero energy @xmath71 we start with a similar anstaz for the superpotential of @xmath70 as @xmath72 repeating the same procedure as before , we find that the superpotential parameters ( @xmath73 ) have similar relationships with parameters of the corresponding potential , as in the previous case .",
    "note that we have chosen @xmath74 as independent parameters and @xmath57 is calculated through the constraint condition .",
    "as during the passage of calculating first member in the hierarchy to the next one @xmath54 is translated to @xmath64 , so the calculated value of @xmath57 will be different from it s previous value .",
    "we call it @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath73 are now related with @xmath75 by @xmath76 so the constraint condition for ground state is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "then the ground state energy of @xmath79 is @xmath80 we have calculated the ground state of @xmath70 which is actually the first excited state of @xmath45 .",
    "now as ground state energy of @xmath45 has been made zero by shifting energy scale , so the calculated ground state energy of @xmath70 have to be properly shifted by adding the ground state energy of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , in proper energy scale , the ground state energy of @xmath70 is @xmath81 thus from the above discussion , we claim that the given mixed potential is shape invariant but this shape invariance criterion holds only when the potential parameters satisfy a particular constraint condition .",
    "so we designate it as conditional shape invariance symmetry .",
    "however it is desired to see the equivalent relation through the riccati equation which is represented as @xmath82 for the traditional exactly shape invariant potential , @xmath66 is exactly the ground state energy as one - to - one correspondence between the potential parameters and those of superpotential parameters holds good .",
    "however direct satisfaction through the algebraic relation as given by eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is not possible as our potential is conditionally shape invariant and there is no clear one - to - one correspondence between potential parameters and superpotential parameters . because of the presence of constraint condition , one parameter is always dependent on the particular choice of potential . nonetheless , if the left side of the eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) together with the value of @xmath83 from eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and right side of the eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) together with the value of @xmath73 from eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and @xmath66 from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , then the algebraic relation presented by eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is exactly satisfied .",
    "one can easily verify it by putting the value of @xmath84 and @xmath57 taken from table 2 from the presented value of potential parameters in section 3 .",
    "+ now following the same procedure we can construct the partner of @xmath85 ( say @xmath86 ) and partner of @xmath86 ( say @xmath87 ) and partner of @xmath87 ( say @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus @xmath41 , @xmath70 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 are basically the members of the hierarchy of hamiltonians which are constructed by basic susy mechanism in each step . in construction of this hierarchy",
    "we utilise the same form of superpotential with different parameters and relate the potential parameters with those of corresponding superpotential parameters , which in turn give us the constraint conditions regarding potential parameters along with the ground state energies .",
    "however , during transition from @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , etc . , we notice that a new constraint condition has to be satisfied in each step , since the parameter @xmath54 is translated as @xmath96 , etc . respectively .",
    "we observe that the pair of partner potentials ( @xmath97 , @xmath85);(@xmath85 , @xmath86);(@xmath86 , @xmath87);(@xmath87 , @xmath88 ) are shape invariant but shape invariance is satisfied only when potential parameters satisfy the particular constraint condition .",
    "thus the first and preliminary finding of our investigation is that the mixed potential is conditionally exactly solvable because it satisfies shape invariance subjected to a particular constraint condition involving potential parameters .",
    "+ the second motivation of our present work is to extend the concept of conditional shape invariance for excited states . here",
    "we take the opportunity to extend our calculation to the excited states of stationary hamiltonian and to see how accurately that can be calculated with the ground state of different members of the hierarchy . for truly shape",
    "invariant potentials this is a trivial task as the ground state of @xmath98 member of the hierarchy basically corresponds to @xmath99 excited state of the original hamiltonian .",
    "but in case of mixed potential , due to additional conditional shape invariance criterion this is no more a trivial task . together with this ,",
    "as all of the potential parameters are not freely chosen , the accuracy of susy result will highly depend on the choice of parameters .",
    "+ in the following section we try to exhibit the degeneracy property of members of the hierarchy of potentials and show that @xmath100      in this section we derive a general formula for calculation of the parameter @xmath57 , as well as the energy of any excited state in terms of independent parameters @xmath56 , @xmath55 and @xmath54 .",
    "for the first excited state if we write the constraint condition as a quadratic equation in @xmath57 ( renaming as @xmath36 ) , then @xmath101 solving this equation , we get two solutions for @xmath36 @xmath102 the second solution for @xmath36 has been chosen .",
    "it is evident from the construction of hierarchy of hamiltonians that for different members of the hierarchy , constraint conditions are also different , as parameters are translated .",
    "of the two possible solutions for @xmath36 , only @xmath103 is parametrically translated properly from @xmath57 , as we have taken @xmath104 for the ground state .",
    "so we have chosen the second solution as only this solution incorporates the translational change of @xmath54 . as @xmath55 and @xmath56 are independent parameters , they are constants for all @xmath105 .",
    "let for @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "then for @xmath109 we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "generalizing eq .",
    "( 34 ) , we obtain the exression of @xmath112 for any higher order excited state , which is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 . now in terms of ground state angular momentum @xmath54 ,  @xmath112 can be written as @xmath115 it is to be noted that from eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , the parameter @xmath57 can be calculated for the ground state as well as for any excited state . +",
    "hence the ground state energy in terms of independent parameters is @xmath116 now the ground state energy of @xmath60 in properly shifted scale , which is the first excited state energy of @xmath41 , is given by @xmath117 generalizing , ground state energy of @xmath106 , which is the @xmath118th excited state of @xmath41 , is @xmath119 as the expression is written in terms of independent parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , which are constants , any excited state energy of @xmath41 can be easily calculated .",
    "so all the excited states of @xmath106 can be obtained exactly and analytically , provided @xmath112 satisfies the constraint condition which highlights the fact that in this case exact solution is a manifestation of conditionally shape invariance symmetry .",
    "for the first choice ( denoted by i ) we take @xmath120 . and",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is equal to @xmath121 which is calculated from the conditional shape invariance criterion .",
    "the summarized results for energy calculation are presented in table 1 .",
    "all the calculated energies are in the original scale .",
    ".comparison of energies of ground and excited states of @xmath41 obtained from susy formalism with the numerical results .",
    "choice of parameters corresponds to set i : @xmath54=1 , @xmath55=0.5 , @xmath56=0.01 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for further clarification , in fig.1 and in fig.2 we plot @xmath122 , @xmath85 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 together .    for the first choice all the four members basically overlap and it is very hard to distinguish them .",
    "although @xmath57 is calculated from constraint condition in each step , the variation in @xmath57 is insignificant as value of @xmath57 is very small .",
    "+ but for the second choice , the change in calculated values of @xmath57 is significant . during passage of @xmath126 ,",
    "the value of @xmath57 becomes less negative which makes the potential less negative .",
    "thus the susy values for the excited states of @xmath41 are lower than the numerical values .",
    "the effect is more significant for higher order excited states .",
    "+ one may be curious to know what will be the result for some other choices of @xmath57 .",
    "for some other choice of @xmath57 where the difference of @xmath57 is significant for any two partner potential , the partner potentials will be more distinct .",
    "also for such a set of parameters , although the ground state energy will always be exact , analytically and numerically calculated energy values may differ significantly for the excited states .",
    "it is to be noted that in this paper , our main motivation is to depict the efficacy of susy methodology and conditional shape invariance symmetry .",
    "so we have deliberately kept those choices where @xmath127 is very small .",
    "in the present manuscript we have discussed the conditional shape invariance symmetry of a mixed potential . we first show that conditional shape invariance is the required symmetry to have the conditional exact solution of this potential .",
    "our superpotential ansatz is a very powerful technique where no initial input is necessary . utilizing the riccati equation we relate the unknown parameters of the superpotential in terms of the potential parameters .",
    "next we develop the hierarchy of hamiltonians and highlight the fact that during the passage from one member to the next of the hierarchy of hamiltonians the conditional shape invariance symmetry is necessary .",
    "finally in the second part of our work we have extensively used the conditional shape invariance property as a very powerful tool to get the excited states of the original potential for a restricted set of potential parameters . in each case",
    "we look for the exact algebraic result for the ground state of the susy partners , then susy results are further compared with the numerical solution of schrdinger equation .",
    "the open question in this discussion remains wheather it is possible to extend our present methodology for the other choice of ces potentials where more than one constraint condition has to be satisfied .",
    "one such potential is the generalized polynomial potentials @xcite .",
