    "the mechanism behind the current phase of accelerated expansion of the universe is not understood .",
    "if acceleration is caused by a cosmological constant ( or vacuum energy ) then the magnitude is tiny compared to expectations from fundamental physics .",
    "the alternatives are either that space is filled with dark energy ( de ) , an accelerant with strange properties that has never been detected in laboratories ; or that the gravitational equations of _ einstein _ are insufficient and that acceleration arises naturally within the correct theory , so - called modified gravity ( mg ) theories .",
    "there are now many models that purport to explain accelerated expansion , and often these models make different predictions for how matter is clustered in the universe .",
    "this clustering can be probed via ` weak ' lensing : measuring a small , correlated distortion of galaxy shapes that is imparted by the light - bending effect of matter along photon trajectories between the galaxy and a telescope on earth .",
    "it follows that the lensing signal can be used to infer the matter clustering and thus discriminate between models .",
    "unfortunately , weak lensing has its disadvantages : foremost among these is that it measures a projected version of the density field , where difficult - to - model , non - linear , small - scale perturbations close to the observer contribute to the shear signal at the same angular scale as larger scale perturbations further away .",
    "this angular scale mixing means that the clean , linear signal is difficult to isolate ( although isolation can be partially achieved using tomographic or full 3d lensing @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is significant information in non - linear scales that are automatically measured by lensing , and this information can be exploited with accurate enough modelling . in principle , this accuracy _ is _ attainable using cosmological @xmath5-bodysimulations to determine the small - scale clustering , but simulations are too slow to be run for every combination of model parameters under consideration , and this problem is only amplified when one considers the vast number of different models that may be constrained via lensing .",
    "de models provide an alternative to the standard cosmological constant to bring about the accelerated expansion of the cosmos .",
    "typically , this is achieved by adding a new component with exotic properties to the matter  energy budget of the universe .",
    "these models are dynamical , with a field whose value changes with time . in minimally coupled models de only clusters at the horizon scale , but structure formation on smaller scales is indirectly affected by the modified background expansion rate . in non - minimally coupled models , there can be direct interactions between de and ( dark ) matter .",
    "comprehensive reviews of de models are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass may conceivably be constrained by weak lensing , due to the effect of massive neutrinos on structure formation .",
    "flavour oscillations @xcite point definitively to non - zero masses for at least two of the three neutrino mass eigenstates , but oscillation experiments measure mass  square differences , rather than absolute masses .",
    "this puts a lower bound on the sum of neutrino masses of @xmath6 ( normal hierarchy ) or @xmath7 ( inverted hierarchy ) .",
    "forthcoming cosmological surveys will be powerful enough to distinguish between these two possibilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "neutrinos with masses that are allowed by current cosmological data are relativistic when they decouple , and at recombination , but become non - relativistic later ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "they initially behave like radiation , with no sub - horizon clustering ( @xmath9 ) , but later transition to behaving like matter ( @xmath10 ) and are able to cluster .",
    "thus , neutrinos alter both the background expansion of the universe ( and the angular - diameter distance relation ) and also the growth of cold - matter perturbations directly , because neutrinos are smoothly distributed below their free - streaming scale and so do not contribute to structure development small scales .",
    "reviews of neutrinos in cosmology are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a mg force law is one way to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe . in contrast to de models , mg models attempt to give rise to accelerated expansion via a direct modification of the gravitational force law . in order to comply with accurate tests of gravity on earth , or at the scale of the solar system ,",
    "these models require a ` screening ' mechanism , so that gravity is restored to the standard in environments where it is well tested , while still being allowed to behave differently on large scales and perhaps to give rise to accelerated expansion . in chameleon theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the screening is primarily a function of halo mass and environment , while in @xcite models the screening depends primarily on the local density .",
    "recent reviews of some of the menagerie of possible mg theories are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we provide a halo model based fitting function for the power spectrum of matter fluctuations for a subset of extensions to the standard cosmological paradigm .",
    "we build on the work presented in @xcite in which we developed a version of the standard halo model @xcite that produces matter power spectra that are accurate at the @xmath11 per cent level for a range of standard cosmological parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "this accuracy was achieved by treating several parameters in the usual halo model as free , and fitting these to data from the high resolution simulations of the cosmic emucollaboration @xcite .",
    "cosmic emuwas chosen because the simulations were high precision and thoroughly tested for resolution issues , as well as being designed to cover a large cosmological parameter space . in @xcite",
    "we also investigated the effects of baryonic feedback on the matter spectrum , and showed that the calibrated halo model could be extended to provide a single parameter fitting recipe for a range of baryonic feedback models .",
    "our halo model has recently been used by @xcite to analyse data from the cfhtlenssurvey to provide cosmological constraints while marginalizing over possible feedback models . in this paper , we focus on de models , massive neutrinos and mg force laws , which are not part of the cosmic emuparameter space .",
    "our results are therefore presented at the level of the power spectrum response ( ratio of power in the new model to some fiducial model , which we consider to be well described by our previous work ) predicted by the halo model , compared to the same response seen in simulations .",
    "the fitting formula we produce in this paper can be used in forthcoming weak lensing data analyses to constrain the additional model parameters , or for any application that requires a matter power spectrum .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : halomodel ] , we briefly summarize the basics of the halo model from @xcite that we use to calculate accurate power spectra .",
    "we then present our results in section  [ sec : results ] : for the power spectrum of de ( sections [ sec : de ] , [ sec : codecs ] ) , massive neutrinos ( section [ sec : massive - nu ] ) and mg models ( sections [ sec : chameleon ] , [ sec : vainshtein ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : degeneracy ] , we briefly investigate degeneracies between some of the extensions to the standard cosmological paradigm that we have considered , and comment on the viability of treating these extensions separately .",
    "finally , we summarise in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "weak lensing measures a projected version of the 3d density distribution .",
    "therefore we are primarily interested in the power spectrum of the 3d matter over - density @xmath18 , defined relative to the background density via @xmath19 .",
    "the power spectrum of statistically isotropic density fluctuations depends only on @xmath20 and is given by @xmath21 where the average is taken over modes with the same modulus but different orientations .",
    "we find it more convenient to use the dimensionless quantity @xmath22 : @xmath23 which gives the fractional contribution to the variance per logarithmic interval in @xmath24 in a cube of volume @xmath25 .",
    "if the over - density field is filtered on a comoving scale @xmath26 , the variance is @xmath27 if instead the 1d linear displacement field is filtered then the variance is @xmath28 in both cases we use the window function @xmath29 corresponding to smoothing with a spherical top - hat .",
    "note that @xmath30 is dimensionless , whereas @xmath31 has dimensions of length , @xmath32 diverges for standard cosmological spectra , but @xmath33 is well defined and we denote this asymptotic value as @xmath34 with no argument .    in this paper",
    ", we use the model previously developed in @xcite and associated code @xcite : a variant of the standard halo model with parameters tuned to match the power spectra data from the cosmic emusimulations . in that paper",
    ", we showed that it was possible to fit a range of cosmological models at the @xmath3 per cent level for @xmath35 and 10 per cent level for @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for full details of our halo model , but we provide a short summary here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : dgp ]        we utilize simulations for three different values of @xmath38 as well as for a @xmath39cdmmodel with matched initial conditions , these are listed in table [ tab : dgp ] and were run using the simulation code isis @xcite .",
    "the linear gravity enhancement means that large - scale structure is more developed in the vainshtein models compared to @xmath39cdm .",
    "we compute the power spectrum for each simulation at @xmath40 and show the response in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgp ] .",
    "the short - dashed lines show the expected , constant enhancement from linear perturbation theory , which the simulations follow with their largest modes ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the long - dashed lines show the power spectrum prediction of halofit , which we see matches the standard bump enhancement around @xmath42 for each model . however , we see that this enhancement is suppressed in the simulations relative to the halofitexpectation , and is almost absent in the @xmath43 model .",
    "the same is true of predictions from the halo model presented in @xcite . clearly",
    "this defect in modelling arises because we have not included the vainshtein mechanism at all , which ensures that gravitational forces on small scales return to standard . to ameliorate this",
    "we once again turn to the spherical model .",
    "the spherical model in dgp gravity was investigated in @xcite where it was found that improved mass function , halo bias and halo - model power spectra predictions were produced when incorporating spherical model predictions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 . however , the results are not perfect for the power spectrum , and not accurate enough to be used in an analysis .",
    "we employ the same strategy in this work , but permit ourselves the freedom of altering the amplitude of the spherical model @xmath44 and @xmath45 relations to best match the simulated power spectrum data .",
    "we also ignore the vainshtein mechanism in our spherical model calculation , because @xcite show that it makes very little difference to the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "our hope is that allowing ourselves the freedom of altering the amplitude of the deviation in the spherical model calculations will account for the vainshtein mechanism and produces accurate results .",
    "we find that dgp einstein - de - sitter spherical model results ( see appendix  [ app : spherical_model ] ) can be well fitted by @xmath46,0.4,1.,0.9973)\\ , \\cr { \\delta_\\mathrm{v}}&\\simeq 178\\times[1 - 0.08a(h_0 r_\\mathrm{c})^{-0.7}]\\ , } \\label{eq : spherical_ndgp}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the sigmoid function defined in equation ( [ eq : sigmoid ] ) .",
    "we then fit the halo model power spectrum to simulation data letting the amplitude of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 relations be free parameters ( the @xmath48 in the @xmath44 equation and @xmath49 in that of @xmath45 ) .",
    "we find best fitting amplitudes for @xmath44 of @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath45 .",
    "our final power spectra are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgp ] ( solid lines ) , where it can be seen that we achieve few per cent level matches to all three models at @xmath40 and @xmath52 .",
    "once again , the trend in @xmath44 preferred by the halo model fitted to the simulation data is opposite to that of spherical model calculations .",
    "@xcite show improved response from the halo model when using the spherical model to calculate both @xmath44 and @xmath45 , but the resulting response is by no means accurate .",
    "the spherical model in galileon models ( which are also vainshtein screened ) has been investigated by @xcite and the galileon halo model by @xcite . for the mass function",
    "they find a need to recalibrate the parameters of @xcite to obtain good results to the mass function in their simulations .",
    "the eventual halo model power spectra presented are only accurate at the @xmath53 level even when using relations ( e.g.,mass function , @xmath54 ) calibrated from the exact simulations they compare to for the halo model power spectrum . again",
    ", this indicates that the halo model in its unaltered form is _ not _ an accurate tool for predicting the non - linear spectrum , we suppose primarily because of features in the non - linear density field that are missing from the model .",
    "cdmmodel for cosmological models with combinations of massive neutrinos ( @xmath55 ) , baryonic feedback ( an agn model ) and mg ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "we show combinations of two of the three effects where the ratio is computed both by assuming the effects act independently ( dashed line ) and via the full halo model calculation ( solid line ) where the effects are treated in tandem .",
    "differences between each pair of dashed and solid lines indicate the extent to which the effects can be treated independently .",
    "we see that this is a good approximation in the case of the combination of baryonic feedback with either mg or massive neutrinos .",
    "however , the approximation degrades when one considers mg and massive neutrinos together ; the non - linear neutrino suppression effect is weaker in @xmath58 compared to standard gravity.,width=321 ]    the modelling developed in the previous section allows us to investigate degeneracies in the matter power spectrum between extensions to the standard cosmological paradigm .",
    "simulations that investigate these degeneracies are rare due to their complexity and expense , but notable exceptions are presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we may use the halo model to compute the power spectrum for combinations of extensions , and we may also include the effects of baryons using the method presented in @xcite .",
    "our results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] where we show power spectra for combinations of massive neutrinos ( @xmath59 from the modelling in section  [ sec : massive - nu ] ) , baryonic feedback ( the agn halo model from @xcite ; obtained by altering parameters within the halo model that govern halo internal structure ) and mg ( an @xmath58 model with @xmath56 and @xmath57 from section  [ sec : chameleon ] ) .",
    "for each pair of extensions , the solid line show the result of a full halo - model calculation , with the combined effects , whereas the dashed line shows the result of using the halo model , but assuming that the extensions to the standard paradigm can be treated independently .",
    "the difference between each pair of lines for the different combinations indicate how good an approximation it is to treat the effects independently .",
    "recent work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) looking at cosmological constraints from all three effects in tandem has been forced to assume they act independently , due to the lack of theoretical models , but with the work presented in this paper we are now in a position to model these effects simultaneously .",
    "the linear spectrum for the ` @xmath58 and massive neutrino ' case is calculated using mg - camb@xcite , but we find that the approximation of treating the two effects separately and then combining them is almost perfect for the linear spectra ( within a per cent for @xmath1 ) .",
    "for this model , we compute @xmath44 and @xmath45 by multiplying the deviations from equations  ( [ eq : spherical_nu_fit ] ) and ( [ eq : spherical_mg_fit ] ) .",
    "this is justified because the origin of the deviation is the same in each case being due to either an increased or a decreased effective @xmath60 , and is small in any case . since the spherical model calculation is non - linear , it may seem preferable to repeat it for each combined model .",
    "however , we do not do this since we found that the spherical model calculations did not provide accurate halo - model power spectra .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] , we see that the halo model predicts that baryonic feedback should act quite independently from either massive neutrinos or mg .",
    "physically , this can be understood as feedback affecting halo internal structure only , but not altering the mass function or large - scale clustering to the same extent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus the power spectrum response predicted by considering feedback in isolation is a fairly good approximation to the response in more general models .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with results presented by @xcite and may be good news considering the relative uncertainty and expense of simulations that contain hydrodynamics and baryonic feedback ; it may be sufficient to run detailed hydrodynamic simulations with feedback for standard @xmath39cdmmodels and then to translate these effects into extensions of the standard model .",
    "in contrast , from fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] we see much larger differences when considering massive neutrinos and mg in tandem .",
    "@xcite investigate @xmath5-bodysimulations that include both massive neutrinos and @xcite @xmath58 gravity ( their fig .",
    "4 ) and come to a similar conclusion . our results are in qualitative agreement with those from the full simulations , in that we see that the suppression of power caused by massive neutrinos is less in the @xmath58 models compared to standard gravity .",
    "this is despite the multiplication of ratios being a very good approximation to create the linear spectrum for these models .",
    "physically this may be because both mechanisms effect the linear growth of perturbations , and this translates into the non - linear density field in a non - linear way .",
    "for example , both mechanisms affect the mass function , but not in such a way that the induced power spectrum change is well approximated by considering each separately .",
    "the level of this non - linear coupling is not sufficient to have affected the results of @xcite and will probably not need to be modelled for near - term lensing surveys .",
    "however , lensing surveys that will be active in the next decade have stringent , per cent level accuracy requirements on the theoretical modelling of the power spectrum in order to provide forecasted constraints .",
    "our results indicate that it will not be sufficient to consider these extensions to the cosmological paradigm in isolation .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is possible to use the halo model to provide accurate matter power spectrum predictions for a variety of extensions to the standard cosmological paradigm .",
    "starting from the accurate halo model of @xcite we investigated both minimally and non - minimally coupled de models , massive neutrinos and mg forces . in each case",
    "we compared predictions from the halo model to simulations of each extension at the level of the power spectrum response ; a measure of deviation from a fiducial model .",
    "we demonstrated that models of de parameterized via @xmath61 could be matched at the few per cent level for @xmath1 with no modifications to the @xcite halo model and we noted that our predictions are more accurate than those the @xcite version of halofit .",
    "this suggests that our halo model would produce reasonable answers for other quintessence models , simply by using the correct linear growth function and power spectrum .",
    "we were able to produce few per cent level accuracy for coupled quintessence models for @xmath62 , but to extend to smaller scales we were forced to re - fit the concentration  mass relation that enters into the halo model calculation to power spectrum data for each coupled model .",
    "while this is unsatisfactory , we take comfort in the fact that the required relation at least reflects that measured in these simulations . if some way were developed to predict this relation from first principles then we feel confident that an accurate halo - model prediction scheme could be developed .    for massive neutrinos",
    ", we adapted our halo model calculation so that quantities relevant to structure formation were computed using only the cold , clustering component of the matter only ( i.e.ignoring the hot neutrino component ) .",
    "results from this approach were satisfactory on small scales , but we observed that the @xcite halo model under predicted the power spectrum suppression caused by massive neutrinos around quasi - linear scales ( @xmath63 ) . to remedy matters",
    "we re - parameterized the zeldovich damping term in the @xcite halo model such that results presented in that paper were unaffected ( even improved ) , but so that we matched the quasi - linear damping in massive neutrino cosmologies . to further improve predictions at smaller scales we turned to the spherical model , utilizing the simplifying assumption that neutrinos are completely unclustered in the background , which corresponds exactly to a reduced gravitational constant for clustering . while the exact form of the predictions for the linear - collapse threshold ( @xmath44 ) and virialized over - density ( @xmath45 ) did not provide improved power spectrum predictions , we were able to use the @xmath64 dependence from the spherical model results as the basis for a fitting function that _ does _ provide improvement .",
    "however , the trend in @xmath44 preferred by our fitting to power spectrum data is opposite to that in spherical - model calculations , whereas the trend in @xmath45 is of the same sense and magnitude",
    ". it may be that our spherical model is too simplistic , and that if we were to include neutrino clustering and free - streaming ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) our result for @xmath44 may be fundamentally different .",
    "certainly a neutrino perturbation in addition to that of cdm will accelerate collapse , but results from @xcite indicate that this accelerated collapse is not sufficient to reverse the trend in @xmath44 .",
    "regardless , our final accuracy in comparison to simulations with massive neutrinos is at the few per cent level for @xmath1 and offer a slight improvement over the @xcite extension to halofit .",
    "we investigated non - linear power spectrum predictions for chameleon models taking @xcite @xmath58 models as an example .",
    "once again , we turned to the spherical model for a way to parameterize functional forms for @xmath44 and @xmath45 that we could use to improve predictions . in chameleon models , screening is a function of halo mass , and we introduced a fitting formula for spherical model parameters that included a ` screening mass ' below which haloes feel a @xmath65 gravity enhancement and their spherical model parameters are adjusted accordingly . even when fitting this three - parameter model to simulation data , we were only able to produce @xmath2 per cent level matches for @xmath1 .",
    "while the deviation in models with smaller @xmath66 values is smaller , our model for the deviation is also a poorer fit to simulated data for these smaller values . also , the simulation data prefer the absence of a change in @xmath44 for @xmath58 models while the trend in @xmath45 is of a similar magnitude and the same sense as the spherical model prediction .",
    "our model for chameleon screening in the halo model is perhaps too simple , and in the future it may be fruitful to consider more complicated spherical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or some more universal model for screening such as that proposed by @xcite to see if these result in improved power spectrum predictions when using the same fitting approach we advise in this work .",
    "for example , it may be useful to incorporate environmental screening and the fact that some haloes transition between being screened and unscreened as the universe evolves .",
    "we also investigated the example vainshtein screened mg model of @xcite ( dgp ; @xcite ) and were able to provide few per cent level accuracy compared to simulation data with fitting formula for the spherical model parameters . once again , the trend in @xmath44 required to fit simulation power spectrum data is opposite to that predicted by the spherical collapse model , whereas that for @xmath45 is of a similar magnitude and the same sense .",
    "the relatively good performance of our halo model for vainshtein screened models compared to chameleon may be because the screening mechanism itself is simpler than the chameleon , and all haloes are essentially screened for all times in the model .",
    "it is difficult to know how to interpret our fitting formula in terms of spherical model results : we have seen that to get accurate power spectra we usually require a trend in @xmath44 that is opposite to that predicted by the spherical model .",
    "this contradiction may arise because we are using a tuned version of the halo model , rather than a pure one .",
    "however , it has been shown by many other authors that including the ` correct ' spherical model predictions within a halo model power spectrum calculation often leads to only marginal improvements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown that the mass function is approximately universal for a set halo definition ( @xmath45 either via a friends - of - friends linking length or spherical over - density criterion ) but some authors say that universality breaks down if different @xmath45 ( e.g.,from the spherical model ) are used to define haloes in different cosmologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even though enhanced universality might be expected .",
    "however , the usual inconsistency between halo definition and spherical model prediction means we can not make direct comparisons between haloes identified in simulations and the spherical model .",
    "given this , it then seems strange ( and lucky ) that the mass function is so close to universal for a cosmology independent @xmath44 and halo definition .",
    "indeed , using the ` correct ' value of @xmath44 in a mass function prediction such as that of @xcite seems to provide only marginal gains at the high mass end @xcite and certainly does not fix remaining non - universality in the mass function . comparing spherical model @xmath45 predictions to simulations",
    "is hard because a @xmath45 criterion is used to define a halo in the first place .",
    "the spherical top - hat is incredibly useful as an analytically soluble non - linear structure formation model and the predictions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are held firmly in the mind of any large - scale structure cosmologist .",
    "the @xcite model predicts universality in the mass function , and this model and its extensions work absurdly well for halo formation , the mass function and halo bias given the simplistic assumptions .",
    "however , universality primarily arises through @xmath69 in @xmath70 and what is less obvious is that if accurate calculations of @xmath44 are relevant for improving mass function predictions or halo - model power spectra , or that if the number @xmath71 should be used as a guideline .",
    "indeed , most modern mass functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are parameterized only in terms of @xmath69 ; @xmath44 is either not present of phased out by some fitting parameters .",
    "so , are we to conclude that the details of spherical model calculations are irrelevant for the details of the mass function and halo - model power spectrum ? the spherical model is simplistic , and clearly the minutiae of non - linear structure formation are far from the minutiae of a collapsing top - hat , and may even be unrelated .",
    "it may be that in order to progress a more complicated model needs to be devised .",
    "one example is the ellipsoidal collapse model , which has been shown to better reflect the mass function by @xcite and more recently to provide an accurate model of halo concentrations by @xcite .",
    "though even this model is simplistic when compared to the chaos of true non - linear collapse .",
    "maybe we have reached the limits of what we can learn about non - linear structure formation from simplistic calculations and detailed understanding can only come from the detailed analysis of simulations ?    finally , we investigated non - linear degeneracies between the extensions we consider , with a particular emphasis on investigating the approximation that extensions beyond the standard cosmological paradigm can be considered independently .",
    "our results indicate that is it a reasonably good assumption to consider baryonic feedback processes in isolation from either mg or massive neutrinos , probably because feedback affects the internal structure of haloes , while leaving their numbers unaffected .",
    "in contrast , we found that our halo model predicts a non - negligible coupling between @xmath58 gravity and massive neutrinos , such that a full halo - model power spectrum is different from one where the effects were treated independently at the @xmath3 per cent level for @xmath4 .",
    "relatively few @xmath5-bodysimulations have been run that investigate combinations of beyond standard model physics , but we note that our halo - model results are in qualitative agreement with those in the joint @xmath58-massive neutrino simulations of @xcite .",
