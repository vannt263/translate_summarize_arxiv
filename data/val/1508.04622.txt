    "quantum speed limit ( qsl ) is of particular interest and has attracted much attention in tremendous areas of quantum physics and quantum information , such as quantum communication @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite and quantum optical control @xcite . in these fields ,",
    "quantum speed limit time ( qslt ) is a key concept , defined as the minimum evolution time in which a system evolves from an initial state to a target state .",
    "qslt denoted by @xmath0 determines the theoretical upper bound on the speed of dynamical evolution . and",
    "by first fixing the actual driving time @xmath1 , the shorter qslt @xmath0 , the greater the capacity for potential speedup will be .",
    "in this situation , @xmath2 means that the evolution is already along the fastest path and possesses no potential capacity for further acceleration @xcite .",
    "the speed - up evolution of an open quantum system is of great significance to the robustness of quantum simulators and computers against decoherence @xcite .",
    "since all quantum systems are unavoidably coupled to their environments , many works have been done on the derivation of the qslt for open system dynamics @xcite since that for isolated system dynamics @xcite .",
    "generally , these bounds of qslt could be divided into two categories :  mandelstam - tamm type based on the cauchy - schwarz inequality and margolus - levitin type based on the von neumann trace inequality .",
    "moreover , deffner @xmath3 @xmath4 demonstrated that non - markovian effects can lead to a smaller qslt and therefore speed up quantum evolution @xcite . on the other hand , xu",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 further proved that the mechanism for speedup is not only related to non - markovianity but also to the population of excited states of the quantum system under a given driving time @xcite .",
    "it is the competition between the non - markovianity of reservoirs and the excited - state population of qubits that ultimately determines the acceleration of quantum evolution in memory environments .",
    "a question may now arise how to design a feasible and effective mechanism to achieve a acceleration process via modulating the non - markovianity and the excited - state population .",
    "this question is of particular interest in the weak system - reservoir coupling regime , where the evolution possesses no potential capacity to accelerate without any operating on the system .",
    "however , there are few researches on this question @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a new method to accelerate the dynamical evolution of a multiqubit open system by employing dynamical decoupling pulses ( ddps ) .",
    "generally , dynamical decoupling technology is used to overcome decoherence by averaging the unwanted interaction with environment to zero @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that , ddps can also accelerate the dynamical evolution , or in another word , reduce the time for performing an elementary logical operation . as a consequence , ddps can greatly increase the number of operations within quantum coherence time of the system .",
    "this can help to improve the speed of quantum computers and communication channels .",
    "meanwhile , compared with a single qubit system , the multiqubit system has more abundant structures and would have more extensive applications in quantum information processing .",
    "this is the main motivation of our present work .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a multiqubit open quantum system in which each qubit only interacts with its own reservoir , there is no direct interaction among qubits , and all reservoirs are independent with each other . for simplicity ,",
    "we take the initial states of multiqubit system under our consideration to be w - type states .",
    "we find that the qslt has nothing to do with the number of qubits and the initial - state parameters , but it can be modulated by the number of ddps to realize the acceleration of quantum evolution . and this speed - up evolution assisted by ddps can be achieved for both the weak system - reservoir coupling case and the strong system - reservoir coupling case . in order to reveal the essential reason of the acceleration , the roles of ddps in the non - markovianity and the excited - state population are studied in detail .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the physical model under our consideration and derive the dynamics of multiqubit open system under ddps . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the effect of ddps on the evolution speed of the multiqubit system and indicate the speed - up mechanism of the dynamic evolution . finally , we conclude our paper with discussions and remarks in the last section .",
    "we consider @xmath5 independent qubits interacting with their own reservoirs locally , and each qubit is controlled by a train of ddps , as showed in fig .",

    "the dynamics of the @xmath5-qubit open system can be obtained by the use of time evolution of each qubit - reservoir pair with the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy difference between the excited state @xmath8 and the ground state @xmath9 of the qubit , @xmath10 are the pauli raising and lowering operators , and @xmath11 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the @xmath12th mode of the reservoir with the mode frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the coupling strength between the qubit and its reservoir is denoted by @xmath14 , which is further characterized by the effective lorentzian spectral density @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the markovian decay rate , @xmath17 is the spectral width .",

    "an increase of the distinguishability of a pair of states during any time interval implies the emergence of the non - markovianity .",

    "( [ 2eq-9 ] ) .",
    "hence , the memory effect of reservoir and the excited - state population become two essential factors for speeding up the dynamical evolution .    as an illustration , we plot the influence of the number of ddps @xmath45 on the excited - state population in the final state @xmath96 of the qubit and the non - markovianity measure of the reservoir @xmath83 in fig .

    "[ 3.eps ] we can see that in the weak - coupling case ( the dashed line ) , the value of @xmath96 of the qubit rises sharply under the action of ddps in the small @xmath45 regime , and it increases slowly in the large @xmath45 regime . in particular , @xmath96 can approach to unity .",
    "these excited - state population changes well match with the qslt changes as shown in fig .  [",

    "[ 4.eps](a ) we can see that the non - markovianity is very weak with the maximum @xmath97 .",
    "this means the environment of the multiqubit open system under the action of ddps is a weak non - markovian reservoir .",
    "hence , we can conclude that , although the non - markovianity of reservoir is the necessary condition for speeding up @xcite , the excited - state population is the dominant mechanism of the quantum speed - up in the weak - coupling case .",
    "it is through controlling the excited - state population of the qubits that ddps can accelerate the dynamic evolution of the quantum system under our consideration .    in the strong - coupling case ( i.e. , @xmath98 )",
    ", the influence of the number of ddps @xmath45 on the excited - state population of the qubit @xmath96 and the non - markovianity measure of the reservoir @xmath83 is different from the weak - coupling case .",

    "[ 4.eps](b ) describes changes of the non - markovianity measure with respect to the number of ddps . on one hand , from fig .",
    "[ 3.eps ] , we can see that the qubit almost remains in the zero excited - state population for the small number of ddps .",
    "this means that the excited - state population does not affect the speed of the dynamic evolution for the small number of ddps . on the other hand , comparing fig .",
    "[ 3.eps ] with fig .",
    "[ 4.eps](b ) for the strong - coupling case , we can find that the qslt changing rule under the small @xmath45 condition well matches with that of the non - markovianity measure .",
    "so the non - markovianity plays the decisive role on accelerating the dynamic evolution for the small @xmath45 case in the strong - coupling regime . from fig .",
    "[ 3.eps ] and fig .",

    "[ 2.eps ] with fig .",
    "[ 3.eps ] and fig .",
    "[ 4.eps](b ) , for the strong - coupling case we can find that both of the excited - state population and the non - markovianity play an important role for the quantum speedup , it is the competition between the excited - state population and the non - markovianity that takes the responsibility to accelerate quantum evolution in the large @xmath45 regime of ddps .    finally , we discuss the control mechanism of the non - markovianity of a reservoir by the use of ddps . from fig .  [ 4.eps ]",
    "we can see that on the whole , the non - markovianity increase firstly and then decrease later with increasing ddps number @xmath45 .",
    "this can be explained by the effect of ddps on the dynamics of each qubit . as shown in fig .",
    "[ 5.eps ] , the excited - state population of the qubit @xmath41 fast oscillates as the number of ddps @xmath45 increases .",
    "overall , ddps not only makes the effective coupling between each qubit and its reservoir decrease , but also makes the information exchange between them more rapidly .",
    "it is the competition between these two effects that leads to the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , contrasting the two subfigures fig .  [ 4.eps](a ) and fig .  [ 4.eps](b ) , we can see that the value of @xmath83 in strong - coupling regime is greater than that in weak - coupling regime , while in the weak - coupling regime the dynamics will be markovian ( @xmath100 ) in the absence of ddps ( @xmath101 ) . besides , the optimal initial - state pairs are also different in two regimes for calculation of the measure of non - markovianity . in the weak - coupling case , the optimal initial - state pair is proved to be @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , while in the strong - coupling case , the optimal initial - state pair changes from @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) to @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) as @xmath45 is increased .",
    "but anyway , @xmath88 reflects the measure of non - markovianity .",
