    "studies aimed at the identification of new superheavy elements which contribute to the fundamental knowledge of nuclear potentials and the resulting nuclear structure .",
    "the concept of an `` island of stability '' existing near the next spherical doubly magic nucleus heavier than @xmath9pb arises in every advanced model of nuclear structure @xcite .",
    "the elements upto z = 118 have been synthesized till today with half - lives varying from a few minutes to milliseconds @xcite . but theoretically predicted center of the island of stability could not be located .",
    "more microscopic theoretical calculations have predicted various regions of stability , namely z = 120 , n = 172 or 184 @xcite and z = 124 or 126 , n = 184 @xcite .",
    "there is a need to design the new experiments to solve the outstanding problem of locating the precise island of stability for superheavy elements .",
    "measurements on the @xmath7-decays provide reliable information on nuclear structure such as ground state energies , half - lives , nuclear spins and parities , shell effects , nuclear deformation and shape co - existence @xcite .",
    "therefore as one of the most important decay channels for unstable nuclei , @xmath7-decay is extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "both non - relativistic ( e.g. skyrme hartree fock ) theory @xcite and relativistic microscopic mean field formalism ( rmf ) @xcite predict probable shell closures at z = 114 and 120 .",
    "microscopic interaction for the existence of the heaviest element was estimated by meitner and frisch @xcite .",
    "myers and swiatecki @xcite estimated the fission barriers for wide range of nuclei and also far into the unknown region of superheavy elements .",
    "the historical review on theoretical predictions and new experimental possibilities are given by a. sobiczewski , f .",

    "a considerable increase in nuclear stability was expected for the heaviest nuclei with n @xmath10 170 in the vicinity of the closed spherical shells , @xmath11 ( or possibly 120 , 122 or 126 ) and n = 184 , similar to the effect of the closed shells on the stability of the doubly magic @xmath9 pb ( z = 82 , n = 126 ) @xcite .",
    "the change of shape from spherical to deformed ( oblate / prolate ) configuration in the @xmath12-decay process gives us valuable information about the nuclear structure properties @xcite .",
    "the fusion - evaporation reaction of @xmath13am + @xmath14ca , leads to the formation of @xmath15115 nuclei .",
    "according to the predictions @xcite , the 3n- and 4n- evaporation channels results the odd - odd isotope @xmath16115 ( @xmath17 ) and odd - a isotope @xmath18115 ( @xmath19 ) . here",
    "our basic motivation is to study the @xmath12-decay properties of these synthesized isotopes .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the scientists at dubna re - performed the same experiment , where the results are yet to be published @xcite .",
    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) formalism is presented in section ii .",
    "the results of our calculation are in section iii .",
    "section iv includes the @xmath12-decay modes of @xmath16115 and @xmath18115 isotopes .",
    "summary of our results is given in section v.",
    "the microscopic self consistent calculation is now a standard tool to investigate the nuclear structure .",
    "the starting point of the rmf theory is the basic lagrangian @xcite ( the linear walecka model ) that describes nucleons as dirac spinors interacting with the meson fields .",
    "however , the original lagrangian of walecka has taken several modifications to take care of various limitations and the recent successful relativistic lagrangian density for a nucleon - meson many body system @xcite is expressed as ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the bare nucleon mass and @xmath22 is its dirac spinor .",
    "nucleons interact with the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 mesons .",
    "we obtain the field equations for the nucleon and mesons .",
    "the self - consistent iteration method solved the coupled equations .",
    "( center of mass ) motion energy correction is estimated by the harmonic oscillator formula @xmath26 . from the resulting proton and neutron quadrupole moments , the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath27 , as @xmath28 .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) matter radius is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass number , and @xmath31 is the deformed density .",
    "the total binding energy and other observables are also obtained by using the standard relations , given in @xcite .",
    "we use the well known nl3 parameter set @xcite .",
    "this set reproduces the properties of the stable nuclei and also predicts for those far from the @xmath32-stability valley .",
    "we obtain different potentials , densities , single - particle energy levels , radii , deformations and the binding energies .",
    "the maximum binding energy corresponds to the ground state for a given nucleus and other solutions ( intrinsic excited state ) are also obtained .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      from the be , which have calculated from rmf formalism , we evaluated @xmath5 and @xmath33(s ) for whole isotopic chain.the predicted results are compared with frdm predictions @xcite , silisteanu et.al .",

    "@xcite , experimental data @xcite , wherever possible . from fig .",
    "6(a ) , 6(b ) and table ii , we found that rmf results agree well with the results of silisteanu _ et al . _ and samanta _ et al . _ and the experimental data .",
    "we have calculated the binding energy , rms charge and matter radii , quadrupole deformation parameter of the isotope of @xmath18115 and @xmath16115 and also investigated two - neutrons separation energy and energy difference between ground and first excited state , for studying the shape co - existence , pairing energy , for the isotopic chain of z = 115 .",
    "we observed the most stable isotope is @xmath3115 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are in good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "we have seen that the rmf theory provides a resonably good description for whole isotopic chain .",
