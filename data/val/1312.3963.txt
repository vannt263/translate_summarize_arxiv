    "the selection of large samples of active galactic nuclei , including quasars as their high - luminosity tail , is required in many astrophysical areas , such as galaxy evolution , black hole growth , and the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the available quasar samples have increased by over two orders of magnitude in less than two decades and this rapid progress is expected to continue ( for example , simulations predict that lsst will deliver a sample of about 10 million quasars ; see section  [ sec : lsst ] ) . here",

    "the similarity of unresolved quasars to stars in optical imaging surveys poses a difficulty in their identification .",
    "quasars can be reliably identified by their spectra , and the sdss provided a spectroscopically complete survey to @xmath0 with @xmath1106,000 quasars ( schneider et al .",
    "this is the largest homogeneous quasar sample with high - quality optical spectra assembled to date ( pris et al .",
    "2012 recently reported an additional @xmath174,000 objects selected with selection criteria modified to enable the lyman-@xmath2 forest analysis ) .",
    "these objects were selected as quasar candidates using colors measured from the @xmath3 sdss imaging data , and also using radio continuum 20 cm data from the first survey ( becker et al .",

    "the quasar targeting algorithm selects all point sources with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the apparent magnitude in the sdss @xmath6 band ) whose colors place them outside the main stellar locus ( it is a bit more complicated than this  for details please see figure 1 in richards et al .",
    "2002 ) . for quasars at redshifts below about two ,",
    "the most discriminatory color is the @xmath7 color : compared to stars of the same visual color ( e.g. , the @xmath8 color ) , quasars show an excess of ultraviolet flux in the @xmath9 band and thus have bluer @xmath7 colors ( see the left panel in figure  [ fig : uvx ] ) ; this method is often called the uv - excess selection",
    ". the colors of quasars at higher redshifts are typically significantly different from stellar colors .",
    "a thorough analysis of the colors of quasars in the sdss photometric system was presented in richards et al .",
    "in addition , all unresolved sources from the same magnitude range that are within 2 arcsec of a first radio detection are also targeted ( for analysis of these radio quasars , see kimball et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) .",
    "some quasars were also targeted fortuitously via the algorithms for selecting galaxies ( strauss et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the completeness of the resulting quasar sample is above 90% ( the confirmed fraction of all quasars within the adopted flux limits and within the surveyed area ) and the efficiency of color selection is about 65% ( that is , about 35% of selected quasar candidates turned out not to be quasars ) .",
    "this homogeneously selected sample spans a large redshift range ( there are 56 quasars at redshifts beyond 5 in the schneider et al .",
    "sample ) and has enabled numerous quasar studies .",
    "for example , the peak in the comoving volume number density of luminous quasars ( dominated by type i objects ) is now reliably and precisely determined ( see the right panel in figure  [ fig : uvx ] ) , and the luminosity functions of quasars and agn galaxies ( selected using emission line strengths ) appear mutually consistent despite grossly different selection procedures ( hao et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we note that several hundred candidate type ii quasars ( high - luminosity analogs of type 2 seyfert galaxies ) were found in the sdss spectroscopic survey of galaxies ( zakamska et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the relatively simplistic color - based selection algorithm employed by the original sdss spectroscopic target selection pipeline has been significantly improved using modern data mining and machine learning methods .",
    "for example , richards et al .",
    "( 2009 ) introduced a kernel density estimator and a non - parametric bayesian classification method , and bovy et al .",
    "( 2012 ) introduced a gaussian mixture model to recognize quasar candidates .",
    "these methods have yielded large samples of candidates ( of order a million ) and with improved completeness and efficiency tradeoff ; richards et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported efficiency of up to 97% while maintaining fairly high completeness levels above 70% .",

    "( 2010 ) demonstrated that variability can be used to separate quasars from most variable stars even in the dense stellar environments of the magellanic clouds .    a number of studies used sdss light curves for close to 10,000 quasars from stripe 82 to quantify the structure function for quasar variability ( ivezi et al .",

    "the key insight is that for time lags below a year or so quasars have a much steeper structure function ( @xmath20 ) than most variable stars . in other words , compared to their variability at a time lag of , say , one year , quasars vary by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less at time lags below a month or so  this is not true for the overwhelming majority of variable stars . for uv - excess selected objects , variability - based methods that utilize @xmath2 select quasars with a completeness of 90% and a purity of 95% ( schmidt et al .",

    "alternatively , the model ( as well as its modifications ) can be described via a covariance matrix ( see the contribution in these proceedings by ivezi & macleod ) .",

    "thus a damped random walk is equivalent to an ordinary random walk for @xmath26 ( for a random walk , @xmath27 ; the `` damped '' aspect manifests itself as a flat psd for @xmath28 ) .",
    "the time span of sdss data from stripe 82 is sufficiently long to constrain @xmath22 for the majority of the @xmath110,000 quasars with light curves .",
    "macleod et al . ( 2011 ) showed that this additional time scale information can be used to improve significantly the selection based only on the slope of the structure function for small time lags ( see figure  [ fig : macleod ] ) .",
    "for example , it is possible to construct samples with only 15% stellar contamination even when using _ only _ variability - based constraints ( see the left panel in figure  [ fig : macleod ] ) , and 2% stellar contamination when a uv - excess constraint is added ( see figure 12 in macleod et al .",

    "the last decade has seen fascinating observational progress in optical imaging surveys .",
    "the sdss dataset is currently being greatly extended by the ongoing surveys such as pan - starrs ( kaiser et al .",

    "spectroscopic followup of quasar candidates will be attempted as part of the lsst project , the time - resolved aspect of lsst photometric and astrometric data will enable significant improvements in the completeness and efficiency of resulting quasar samples compared to single - epoch measurements .",

    "the system is designed to yield high image quality as well as superb astrometric and photometric accuracy .",

    "about 90% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep - wide - fast survey mode which will observe an 18,000 deg@xmath11 region over 800 times ( summed over all six bands ) during the anticipated 10 years of operations , and yield a coadded map to @xmath33 .",
    "these data will result in databases including about 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars , and will serve the majority of science programs .",
    "the remaining 10% of the observing time will be allocated to special programs such as a very deep and fast time - domain survey .",
    "more details about various science programs that will be enabled by lsst data can be found in the lsst science book ( abell et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the existing selection algorithms based on colors and photometric variability developed with the aid of sdss data will be applicable to lsst data , too .",
    "although lsst will not obtain simultaneous multi - band photometry like sdss did , the averaging of many observations ( ranging from about 50 - 60 in the @xmath9 band to 180 - 190 in the @xmath34 and @xmath6 bands ) will result in sufficiently precise color measurements to recognize easily color offsets from the main stellar locus .",

    "[ [ additional - constraints - proper - motion - and - differential - chromatic - refraction ] ] additional constraints : proper motion and differential chromatic refraction ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in addition to photometry , astrometric measurements can help to distinguish quasars from stars .",
    "first , measurable proper motion will reject about 2/3 of all stars , even before any color or photometric variability criteria are applied .",
    "lsst proper motion errors will be 0.5 mas / yr for sources with @xmath37 and 1.0 mas / yr for @xmath38 ( ivezi et al .",
    "simulations of the proper motion distribution for milky way stars ( for model description , see ivezi , beers & juri 2012 ) indicate that over @xmath180% of stars with @xmath39 and over @xmath170% of stars with @xmath40 will have proper motions three times larger than expected measurement errors ( with very little dependence on galactic coordinates ) .",
    "these high fractions of rejecteable stars are also expected for various stellar subpopulations , such as brown dwarfs ( contaminants for very high - redshift quasar candidates ) and white dwarfs ( contaminants of @xmath41 candidate samples ) .",
    "an additional astrometric effect that is sensitive to detailed differences in the spectral energy distributions between quasars and stars is the differential chromatic refraction ( dcr ) . due to the wavelength dependence of atmospheric refraction , in images",
    "astrometrically calibrated using stars , quasars show astrometric offsets in a given bandpass as a function of airmass , and also show astrometric offsets between different bandpasses even at a fixed airmass ( if larger than one , of course ) . as shown in figure  5 from kaczmarczik et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the astrometric offsets of quasars from stripe 82 between the @xmath9 and @xmath42 bands , and between the @xmath42 and @xmath34 bands , can be up to about 20 mas ( depending on redshift ) , even for moderate airmass ( @xmath11.1 - 1.2 ) .",
    "the measurement errors for these offsets anticipated for the lsst main survey will be below 3 mas for objects brighter than @xmath43 , about 5 mas for objects with @xmath44 , and 10 - 15 mas for objects with @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the dcr offsets for quasars will represent an additional quantity , indpendent of color , variability and proper motion , to help distinguish quasars from stars .",
    "last but not least , both color and dcr measurements can be used to estimate quasar redshifts with a precision comparable to that expected for lsst galaxies . using sdss data ,",
    "kaczmarczik et al . (",
    "2009 ) obtained a measurement precision for this `` photo - astro - z '' of 0.03 , with the fraction of quasars with redshifts correct to within 0.1 of order 90% ."
