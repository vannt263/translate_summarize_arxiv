    "evolution is one of the most fundamental principles in biology . while organismal genotypes are becoming accessible due to rapid advances in sequencing technology , further understanding of the complicated mapping from sequence to phenotype",
    "is necessary for a richer understanding of evolutionary dynamics @xcite .",
    "while the terms genotype and phenotype can be flexibly assigned in a biological system , genotypes are generally defined as the genetic material upon which mutations act and phenotypes capture the properties of the organism on which selection can differentiate . as such , the mapping from genotype to phenotype  the _ gp map _  links mutations to potentially selectable variation , and is therefore of critical importance in understanding evolutionary systems .",
    "gp maps also provide a basis for understanding important biological concepts such as mutational robustness and evolvability , which may profoundly affect evolutionary dynamics , and help determine the fundamental topologies of the landscapes upon which evolutionary processes occur @xcite .",
    "in general it is intractable to directly model the details of even small parts of a whole organismal gp map , due to both the very large numbers of genotypes , and a lack of knowledge of all possible phenotypes .",
    "advances have been made in recent years , however , with the use of simplified models .",
    "three particular systems have been modelled with notable success .",
    "firstly , genetic regulatory networks have been approximated using a variety of abstract models , including boolean networks @xcite . despite their simplicity ,",
    "boolean networks have demonstrated a remarkable ability to produce biologically realistic results .",
    "for example , they have been shown to reproduce key aspects of the yeast cell cycle @xcite . secondly , rna secondary structure can be routinely and accurately predicted via a host of different methods @xcite , as a result of which it has become one of the best - known gp maps @xcite , particularly for the study of evolutionary dynamics @xcite .",
    "finally , the complex problem of a protein folding into well defined tertiary structure has been investigated using various models including the highly simplified hp lattice model , where folds are represented as self - avoiding walks on a lattice , and the full sequence is reduced to binary alphabet ( h stands for hydrophobic and p for polar amino acids ) @xcite . despite its heavily coarse - grained nature , this model has produced important biological insights @xcite and has been shown to accurately model known features of protein tertiary structure @xcite . while these models have been successful for specific biological examples , another very important advantage of their tractability is the potential for extracting more general underlying principles of gp maps , building on our understanding of how evolution shapes the natural world @xcite .        in this paper",
    "we extend this family of coarse - grained models for biological structure , exploring a very recently introduced model for tile self - assembly @xcite which can be viewed as a highly coarse - grained gp map for protein quaternary structure ( protein complexes ) . understanding the formation of protein complexes is important as demonstrated by the fact that most proteins form complexes in the cell ( around @xmath0 in yeast @xcite ) and",
    "the function of these complexes is often strongly linked to their physical form .",
    "protein complexes are formed by the interaction of multiple individual protein chains to form larger structures .",
    "the interaction between two chains is predominantly mediated by hydrophobic forces acting to pack together non - polar amino acids to provide fewer energetically unfavourable interactions with water @xcite .",
    "invaluable resources for the study of protein complexes are the protein data bank , providing a database containing experimentally known protein quaternary structures @xcite , and the 3d complex database @xcite categorising pdb structures with a graph representation of the interactions between different subunits and a characterisation of the symmetry in a complex .",
    "the relationship between the topology of a protein complex and the individual amino acids that make up its protein chains is highly complex due to the multiple functionality encoded in the protein sequence .",
    "for example , correct tertiary structure , folding pathways and other inter - protein interactions are all potential requirements for a single protein chain . given these complexities , a direct and complete gp map of protein quaternary structure is intractable as including all required functionality would be unfeasible . instead ,",
    "in the spirit of the highly simplified hp model for protein tertiary structure , we represent the proteins as square tiles on a lattice @xcite . interactions between tiles model the protein - protein interactions that lead to self - assembly . in the model ,",
    "a genotype is a sequence of characters describing interactions on the edges of the tiles , which , when combined with a self - assembly process on a 2d square lattice , leads to the formation of phenotypes comprising of different square tile building blocks conjoined along interacting edges .",
    "these square tile structures are known as polyominoes and thus , we refer to the model as the polyomino model and the resulting gp map as the polyomino gp map .",
    "they are closely related to a wider class of lattice tiling models that have a long and important history in mathematics and computer science ( which we discuss further in section [ section : model ] ) .    despite these great simplifications , and in analogy with the highly schematic hp model , rna secondary structure models or boolean network models of grns",
    ", we expect the polyomino model to provide insight into the general structure of the full gp map for the formation of protein complexes from folded proteins .",
    "in fact , our earlier work @xcite has already discussed the evolutionary dynamics of the polyomino model , demonstrating that it can be used to rationalise the preference of dihedral over cyclic symmetries in homomeric protein tetramers @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ comparisons ] , we compare coarse - grained representations for rna secondary structure , protein tertiary structure and protein complexes . on the left hand side ,",
    "the biological representation is shown and on the right , a given model representation . through this figure",
    "we wish to highlight two points .",
    "firstly , that each of the model systems is a dramatically simplified version of the corresponding biological system and that the polyomino model is of a similar order of coarse - graining to previous models . and",
    "secondly , that the polyomino model can provide a concise representation of real protein complexes by capturing features such as the symmetry of the subunit arrangements ( c@xmath1 in this case ) .",
    "in contrast to rna secondary structure or protein tertiary structure , where structure forms through the folding of a connected string of individual entities ( nucleotides or amino acids ) , protein complexes are built by joining separate individual entities ( protein chains ) .",
    "furthermore , while for string - like self - assembly the final structure size is constrained , proteins can form unbounded structures that can be ordered or disordered . in our work here , we focus on the subset of deterministic , finite sized structures to model protein quaternary structure .",
    "but , in principle , the polyomino model can also capture the more general phenomenology of unbounded and non - deterministic assembly @xcite .",
    "moreover , tiling models have been used to study synthetic self - assembling systems @xcite , and a better understanding of the design space of polyominoes may aid in the design of these artificial systems .",
    "this article proceeds as follows .",
    "we first describe in detail the polyomino model and some of its fundamental properties ( section [ section : model ] ) .",
    "we then analyse a wide range of properties of the resultant gp map and compare these properties to those described , for example in @xcite , for the hp model and the rna secondary structure map . in particular , we show in sections [ section : redundancy]-[section : components ] that the mapping from sequences to phenotypes for all three models share the following general properties : _ redundancy _ ( there are many more genotypes than phenotypes ) leading to large _ neutral sets _ ( the collection of all genotypes that map to a given phenotype ) and _ phenotype bias _ ( some phenotypes are associated with many more genotypes than others ) .",
    "a more fine - grained analysis shows that the neutral sets also exhibit _ component disconnectivity _",
    "( not all genomes in a neutral set can be linked with single mutational steps ) .",
    "we proceed with a more detailed comparison of the polyomino and rna systems , through considering _ shape space covering _",
    "( most phenotypes can be reached from any other phenotype with just a small number of mutations ) , before showing the mean mutational robustness of a phenotype ( the _ phenotypic robustness _ ) scales very roughly logarithmically with the redundancy of a phenotype , and finally that it is positively correlated with the _ evolvability _ ( defined here as the number of other phenotypes _ potentially _ accessible from a phenotype ) , as postulated to hold more generally by @xcite . finally , in section",
    "[ section : discussion ] we discuss some implications of the remarkable agreement we find between the structure of our polyomino gp map and those of the better studied rna secondary structure and hp maps .",
    "the process of tiling and its connection with computer science was first developed by @xcite . since then , tiling models have been shown to be capable of computation and , in particular , turing - universal computation under the condition that cooperative binding is allowed between tiles , demonstrating the ability of 2d tiling systems to model computational as well as structure - forming processes @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the program size complexity necessary to build a structure of a given size .",
    "more general considerations of the complexity of tiled structures have since been discussed in @xcite , with a more biological slant given by @xcite and applications to artificial biological systems discussed by @xcite .    here , rather than focussing on these tiles as potential computing devices or as models for complexity ,",
    "we explore how they can be used to understand the gp map of a specific biological system , namely the self - assembly of finite - sized protein structures . nevertheless , we are aware that some of our conclusions may have applications for a wider class of systems",
    ".    we now proceed with a more detailed description of the polyomino model as a gp map .",
    "the genotype is modelled as a character string representation of a set of @xmath2 tiles which make up an _",
    "assembly kit_. the edges of each tile in the assembly kit is given a number which represents the _ interface type_. interactions between interface types are defined via an _ interface interaction matrix _ @xmath3 . in our work here , we only consider one such interaction matrix type , with a total of @xmath4 interface types .",
    "there are no self - interacting interface types and interface types interact in unique pairs ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , ... ) , with the only fully neutral types being @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "defining interface interactions in this way allows the single parameter @xmath4 to control the number of potential unique bond types . as such ,",
    "the two parameters that describe a given parameterisation of the polyomino gp map are the tile number @xmath2 and the total number of interface types @xmath4 , allowing a particular polyomino gp map to be labelled as @xmath9 .    below we discuss the genotype , phenotype and map used in the polyomino gp map .",
    "the genotype for the set of building blocks in the assembly kit is written as a bit - string of length @xmath10 in base @xmath11 .",
    "the base we employ in this paper is the total number of interface types @xmath4 used in a given gp map .",
    "this allows each base to mutate to any other base at each site .",
    "the procedure of converting a genotype string into the assembly kit is part of the _",
    "map_.      in the context of the self - assembly mapping , there are several ways of classifying a polyomino structure .",
    "these may include criteria based on its overall shape and the individual tile types making up the final polyomino structure , as well as individual tile orientations .",
    "these different possibilities are discussed in @xcite .    here",
    ", we will classify the phenotype according to the overall shape of the polyomino independent of origin translation and c@xmath1 ( 90 degree ) rotations .",
    "note that chiral counterparts of polyominoes represent distinct phenotypes .",
    "the map has two stages : conversion of the genotype into the assembly kit , followed by assembly of a polyomino from an assembly process involving the assembly kit and the interface interaction matrix .",
    "a diagram representing this process is shown in fig . [ method ] .",
    "the characters of the genotype are read from left to right along the string .",
    "characters are assigned to the next blank edge of a square tile in the assembly kit .",
    "the edges are taken in clockwise order ( from the top side ) with all edges being written before moving on to a new block .",
    "the total number of tiles , in terms of the genotype string length , can be expressed as @xmath12 .",
    "the assembly of the 2d polyomino takes place on a square lattice where individual tiles from the assembly kit are placed .",
    "the interface types on the edges of tiles can form an attractive interaction as determined by the binary interface interaction matrix @xmath3 , with 1 denoting attraction and 0 neutrality .",
    "a bond may form between tiles if two adjacent ( interacting ) edges have interface types which attract , as defined by the interaction matrix .",
    "the assembly process is initialised by placing ( seeding ) a single tile on the lattice .",
    "we will consider only gp maps in which the seed tile corresponds to the first tile described in the genotype .",
    "a different protocol where any tile may be used to seed the assembly is also possible and does not significantly effect the results presented here .",
    "the assembly then proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "_ available sites _ on the lattice are identified .",
    "these are places on the lattice where a tile may be placed in a particular orientation such that it will form a bond to an adjacent tile that has already been placed . in the assembly algorithm ,",
    "a list is kept of the position , tile type and orientation for each possible tile placement .",
    "a random available site on the lattice is chosen .",
    "the chosen site is filled with the associated tile and with the corresponding orientation .",
    "these steps are repeated until either :    * there are no available sites for bonding .",
    "* the structure grows beyond a certain width or height @xmath13 , which is taken as a proxy for unbounded assembly , so that the resulting phenotype is described as _",
    "unbound_. we set @xmath14 here , but our results are not sensitive to this cutoff as , for the polyomino systems we study here , there are no bounded structures larger than this .    at this point",
    "the assembly process is terminated and the structure produced is recorded . to test whether the structure is _ deterministic _ , the assembly process is repeated @xmath15 times , with each c@xmath1 rotation of the final structure checked against the recorded structure .",
    "if there are any differences between any of the @xmath15 assemblies , the phenotype is classified as _ non - deterministic_. phenotypes that are classified as unbound or non - deterministic structures are represented by a single phenotype , which we refer to as the undetermined ( _ und _ ) phenotype and is assumed not to be biologically relevant in this context . a more detailed discussion of the classification of polyomino structures is given in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we analyse the polyomino gp map by making measurements of redundancy , phenotype bias and component numbers , before moving on to analyse the properties of shape space covering , robustness and the relationship between robustness and evolvability . for each measurement ,",
    "comparisons are made with the rna secondary structure model and , for the first three of these properties , an hp lattice protein model .",
    "the software used to model rna secondary structure was the well - known vienna package @xcite , and for the hp lattice model we used the data from the spaces enumerated by @xcite .      .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]          robustness and evolvability are two evolutionary properties that have received much recent attention in the literature @xcite . as discussed in the previous section , robustness is the ability of an organism to maintain its phenotype if its genotype is mutated .",
    "evolvability on the other hand is considered as the capacity for producing phenotypic variation @xcite .",
    "one might expect that for an individual to be robust it would have to compromise its ability to produce variation ( to be evolvable ) . using the rna gp map , @xcite demonstrated that this expected trade - off exists for individual genotypes , but that the two properties are in fact positively correlated at the level of phenotypes .",
    "a possible geometric explanation is that phenotypes can become more mutationally robust as a result of increased redundancy ( more neutral neighbours ) .",
    "this in turn leads to connected components spreading out further across genotype space and possessing a greater ` surface ' , thus allowing a greater number of phenotypes to be accessible through neutral mutations .",
    "wagner s argument is really about the static structure of genotype space and does not account for any dynamical evolutionary effects .",
    "other authors have considered further static properties @xcite , including a different notion of phenotypic evolvability ( diversity evolvability ) defined as being the probability that two non - neutral mutations lead to different phenotypes .",
    "such a definition of evolvability was found to not be correlated with robustness in the rna gp map .",
    "a dynamical study by @xcite demonstrated that the relationship between robustness and evolvability could also depend on population parameters and mutation rates . in our work here , we simply consider whether the static properties of the polyomino gp map behave in a similar manner to those of the rna gp map as demonstrated by @xcite without here commenting on the wider debate of how robustness and evolvability relate .    in the left hand plots of fig .",
    "[ re ] , we show fractional evolvability versus fractional robustness , for genotypes and phenotypes in both the rna @xmath16 and polyomino @xmath17 gp maps .",
    "the genotype plot is a binned version of @xmath18 randomly sampled genotypes for each phenotype ( apart from the non - deterministic / trivial structure ) in each gp map .",
    "the fraction of all phenotypes that can be produced in any 1-mutation to each sampled genotype ( genotypic evolvability , @xmath19 ) is plotted against the fraction of those 1-mutations that produce the same phenotype as that of the genotype being tested ( genotypic robustness , eq.[eq : r_g ] ) . for both polyominoes and rna",
    "we see a significant negative correlation .",
    "this expected negative correlation simply represents the trade - off between genotypic evolvability and robustness at the level of the individual genotype    in the right hand plots of fig .",
    "[ re ] , we plot phenotypic evolvability against phenotypic robustness",
    ". the phenotypic evolvability @xmath20 of phenotype @xmath21 is defined here as the fraction of all phenotypes that can be reached in a single mutation from any genotype with phenotype @xmath21 .",
    "we also refer to this as the _ potential _ evolvability because it represents the potential number of phenotypes that could be reached . whether they can be reached depends , of course , on details of the evolutionary dynamics . for example , if only single mutations are available then @xmath20 should really be defined with respect to the relevant component  @xcite .",
    "phenotypic robustness is defined in the same way as in section [ section : robustness ] , as the average genotypic robustness over all genotypes with phenotype @xmath21 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : r_p ] ) . in the plots ,",
    "we see strong positive correlations for both the rna @xmath16 and the polyomino @xmath17 gp maps , as expected . in other words , for both maps , phenotypes with a greater redundancy can be generated by a larger number of genotypes and are therefore , on average , more likely to be mutationally robust .",
    "furthermore , such phenotypes are also likely to have a larger set of genotypes , and therefore a greater diversity of other phenotypes potentially accessible from this set .",
    "thus , phenotypic robustness and potential evolvability are positively correlated .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the properties of a gp map for biological self - assembly of the kind exhibited by protein quaternary structure based on a recently introduced polyomino model for tile assembly  @xcite .",
    "we compared its properties to models of rna secondary structure and the hp model for protein tertiary structure . as is the case for these two",
    "well studied gp maps , we argue that even though our polyomino model is highly schematic and thus misses many details of protein quaternary structure , it may nevertheless provide important biological insight into the structure of the design space for protein complexes .    despite the great complexity in potential phenotypes ,",
    "the polyomino model remains tractable as demonstrated in this paper by the ability to perform a wide variety of useful measurements on the gp map .",
    "our main results are : firstly , the polyomino model exhibits large - scale redundancy , a strong phenotype bias and the presence of disconnected genotype components across several parameterisations of the polyomino gp map ( section [ section : redundancy]-[section : components ] ) .",
    "secondly , that shape space may be covered in only a fraction of mutations  that is , all phenotypes are a significantly smaller number of mutations away from each other than the total sequence length ( section [ section : ss_covering ] ) .",
    "thirdly , phenotypic robustness scales very roughly with the logarithm of the phenotype frequency ( section [ section : robustness ] ) . and finally , genotypic robustness and genotypic evolvability are negatively correlated , whilst phenotypic robustness and phenotypic ( potential ) evolvability are positively correlated ( section [ section : re ] ) .",
    "the polyomino model describes the self - assembly of disconnected units ( proteins ) into finite sized structures ( protein clusters ) that can vary in size .",
    "by contrast , for rna secondary structure and the hp model for protein tertiary structure , strings of connected units ( nucleotides or amino acids ) assemble into shapes of a fixed size .",
    "given the substantially different class of the phenotypes in our model , it is remarkable that the measured properties of these gp maps turn out to be so similar .",
    "this begs the question of whether what we observe is in fact a more general property of self - assembling systems , or even broader , whether a wider class of gp maps will share these properties .",
    "this question can be sharpened by looking at the different properties separately .",
    "redundancy should be widely shared across gp maps .",
    "phenotype bias has been observed in models for gene - regulatory networks @xcite and developmental networks  @xcite . could it be a more general property of gp maps ?",
    "disconnected components have also been observed in a boolean threshold model for gene regulation @xcite . to our knowledge shape space",
    "covering has not been studied for other gp maps , but general considerations based on the high dimensionality of genetic space suggest that something like this may be more widely relevant @xcite .",
    "finally , the correlation between phenotypic robustness and potential evolvability is deeply connected to the geometry of neutral sets and so is likely to be a much more general property of gp maps .",
    "how this correlation plays out for realistic evolutionary dynamics is , of course , a much more complicated question .",
    "we are hopeful that more complete answers will be derived through further analysis and comparisons of different model gp maps in a similar manner to the work here and in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "an important related question is whether model gp maps for parts of systems can be combined to achieve a more complete understanding of the evolution of phenotypic traits in the full organismal gp maps @xcite .",
    "the polyomino model can easily be adapted to study unbounded assembly or the assembly of synthetically produced objects like dna tiles or patchy colloids @xcite .",
    "thus the perspective gained from viewing polyominoes as a gp map may also shed light on the artificial design process for these systems .    finally ,",
    "although we introduce the polyomino model as a coarse - grained model for protein quaternary structure , it is clear that the model is not capable of modelling particular intricacies of some individual proteins .",
    "for example , f1-atpase is a protein whose subunit structure could not be accurately represented with a square tile model .",
    "we argue that the polyomino model nevertheless provides biological insight into questions about the global nature of the gp map that would not be computationally accessible using more complex models with greater biological detail .",
    "however , further work is needed to assess how well this new gp map performs in this respect .",

    "<S> the mapping between biological genotypes and phenotypes is central to the study of biological evolution . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a rich , intuitive , and biologically realistic genotype - phenotype ( gp ) map , that serves as a model of self - assembling biological structures , such as protein complexes , and remains computationally and analytically tractable . </S>",
    "<S> our gp map arises naturally from the self - assembly of polyomino structures on a 2d lattice and exhibits a number of properties : _ redundancy _ ( genotypes vastly outnumber phenotypes ) , _ phenotype bias _ ( genotypic redundancy varies greatly between phenotypes ) , _ genotype component disconnectivity _ ( phenotypes consist of disconnected mutational networks ) and _ shape space covering _ ( most phenotypes can be reached in a small number of mutations ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the mutational robustness of phenotypes scales very roughly logarithmically with phenotype redundancy and is positively correlated with phenotypic evolvability . although our gp map describes the assembly of disconnected objects , it shares many properties with other popular gp maps for connected units , such as models for rna secondary structure or the hp lattice model for protein tertiary structure . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable fact that these important properties similarly emerge from such different models suggests the possibility that universal features underlie a much wider class of biologically realistic gp maps . </S>",
