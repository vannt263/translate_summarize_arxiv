    "a small body orbiting a star with a planet is affected by the planet s gravitational field .",
    "when the orbital periods of the body and the planet have a ratio of small natural numbers , mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) can occur .",
    "if the body is captured in an mmr , then variations of the semimajor axis are balanced by the resonant interaction with the planet s field of gravity .",
    "examples of mmrs in the solar system are numerous .",
    "we can mention the mmrs of asteroids with jupiter , which have resulted in the formation of the kirkwood gaps in the main asteroid belt @xcite , mmrs of particles in saturn s rings with its moons , mmrs of the edgeworth ",
    "kuiper belt objects with neptune , mmrs of dust particles with the earth @xcite , and so on .",
    "following the observational confirmation of dust particles being captured in mmrs with the earth by satellites _ iras _",
    "@xcite and _ cobe _",
    "@xcite , unknown properties of orbital evolution for dust particles captured in mmrs have become an interesting topic of research .",
    "if the planet moves in a circular orbit around the star and the mass of the particle is negligible in comparison with the mass of the star and also in comparison with the mass of the planet , we have a special gravitational problem of three bodies .",
    "this gravitational problem is called the circular restricted three - body problem ( cr3bp ) in celestial mechanics .    unlike larger bodies such as the planets or moons , dust particles can be significantly affected by weak non - gravitational forces .",
    "the acceleration of the particle caused by electromagnetic radiation described by the poynting  robertson ( pr ) effect @xcite was used within the framework of the planar cr3bp by @xcite in order to obtain stationary solutions for dust particles captured in mmrs .",
    "they found that for all dust particles captured in a given exterior resonance ( the orbital period of the particle in the exterior resonance is larger than the planet s orbital period ) , the eccentricities of the orbits approach a constant value , which they called the `` universal eccentricity '' .",
    "their derivation starts from a near - canonical form of the equations of motion in cartesian coordinates with the pr effect used as a dissipative external acceleration ( for dissipative accelerations in the cr3bp and periodic orbits see also @xcite ) .",
    "another near - canonical approach was used in @xcite in order to determine which non - gravitational forces ( with assumed behavior leading to the universal eccentricity ) give a stable , and which an unstable , capture in an exterior resonance within the framework of the planar cr3bp .",
    "the author began from a near - canonical system of equations written in delaunay variables .",
    "the secular time derivative of the eccentricity for a dust particle captured in an mmr in the planar cr3bp under the action of arbitrary non - gravitational effects can be obtained using the method presented in @xcite . within the framework of the cr3bp , there exists a constant , referred to as the jacobi constant , which depends on the position and velocity of the particle and the position of the planet . under the assumptions that the particle is far enough from the planet and that the mass of the planet is negligible compared to the mass of the star , the jacobi constant reduces to the so called tisserand parameter .",
    "the tisserand parameter depends only on the keplerian orbital elements of the particle and the planet . for the pr effect ,",
    "the universal eccentricity was confirmed using a different derivation starting from the secular time derivative of the tisserand parameter by @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "also , a general relation between the secular time derivatives of the eccentricity and inclination during the orbital evolution of a dust particle captured in an mmr in the cr3bp with the pr effect and a radial stellar wind ( for the wind , see @xcite ) has been found . in @xcite are derived the secular time derivatives of the eccentricity and inclination from both a jacobi constant approach and another approach explicitly using the disturbing function .",
    "the equations are deduced depending on which resonance captured the dust particle .",
    "the influence of the pr effect and a non - radial stellar wind @xcite on the secular evolution of the eccentricity for a dust particle captured in an mmr within the framework of the planar cr3bp was analytically investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the secular evolutions of the eccentricity and the argument of pericenter of a dust particle captured in an mmr in the planar circular and elliptical restricted three - body problem with the pr effect were numerically investigated in @xcite .",
    "the influence of an interstellar wind on the motion of dust particles was already mentioned in @xcite .",
    "observations of debris disks around stars show that the interaction of the interstellar wind with the dust particles of the disk can change the shape of the debris disks @xcite . from among only 16 debris disks resolved in scattered light @xcite , as many as three disks show a changed morphology caused by the interaction with the surrounding interstellar matter .",
    "the acceleration acting on a spherical body moving through an interstellar gas was published in @xcite .",
    "this acceleration was used in the calculation of the secular time derivatives of the keplerian orbital elements caused by an interstellar gas flow ( igf ) for an arbitrary orientation of the orbit in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the secular decrease of the semimajor axis for all initial conditions was found .",
    "this result was confirmed analytically by @xcite and numerically by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used an orbit - averaged hamiltonian approach to determine the orbital evolution of a dust particle in a keplerian potential subject to an additional constant force .",
    "if the speed of the igf is much greater than the speed of the dust grain and also much greater than the mean thermal speed of the gas in the flow , then the acceleration caused by the igf reduces to a constant vector .",
    "therefore , the problem which they solved can be applied to the orbital motion of a dust particle under the action of an igf .",
    "the secular orbital motion in this case can be completely solved analytically @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the results of @xcite were used in order to obtain the secular time derivative of the orbit eccentricity for a dust particle captured in an mmr within the framework of the planar cr3bp with the pr effect , a radial stellar wind , and an igf .",
    "the agreement between the analytical and numerical results in @xcite was excellent for the igf in the solar system .",
    "the results show that two sets of orbital evolutions divided by a strong boundary in the initial conditions exist for the exterior 2/1 resonance .",
    "also , some kind of stabilization was found in one of these sets .",
    "these results motivated us to determine some of the basic properties of the orbital evolution of a dust particle captured in an mmr in the planar cr3bp with the pr effect , a radial stellar wind , and an igf , using the improved methods from @xcite .",
    "we will consider the motion of a homogeneous spherical dust particle in the vicinity of a star with one planet moving in a circular orbit ( cr3bp ) .",
    "non - gravitational effects will be added to the cr3bp framework .",
    "the secular variations of the particle orbit caused by these non - gravitational effects can depend on the orientation of the orbit in space .",
    "taking into account this dependence , we will improve the method presented in @xcite for the study of problems which involve non - gravitational effects without a spherical symmetry around the star .",
    "the equation of motion can be written in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 is the velocity of the dust particle , @xmath4 is the position vector of the dust particle with respect to the star , @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the conservative system , and @xmath6 is the non - conservative part of the acceleration . if we add to eq .",
