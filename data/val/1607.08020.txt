    "the family of nuclei composing the beginning of the isotope table provides a wholesome `` laboratory '' which allows one to study the evolution from cluster to shell nuclear structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.1 ] ) . as `` building blocks ''",
    "the light nuclei include the lightest clusters having no excited states , namely , , tritons , @xmath12he nuclei , and deuterons , and nucleons which virtual associations coexist in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "a pair of can constitute the unstable @xmath1be nucleus in the ground @xmath1be@xmath7 or 1st exited @xmath1be@xmath8 states .",
    "the stable @xmath6be and @xmath6li nuclei are important in the structure of the neutron deficient and neutron rich nuclei , respectively .",
    "when the nucleons or clusters are added to the @xmath1be , @xmath6be and @xmath6li nuclei the last ones serve as cores in the subsequent stable and radioactive isotopes . then , the unstable @xmath2b and stable @xmath2be can possess core roles of an equal importance in heavier nuclear structures .",
    "a balanced superposition of the cores , clusters and nucleons in appropriate spin - parity states determine ground state parameters of a corresponding nucleus .",
    "highlights of nuclear clustering in light nuclei studies obtained recently by means of the nuclear track emulsion ( nte ) technique in the framework of the @xmath13 project @xcite are gathered here . in spite of the fact that half a century passed since the nte development it retains the status of an universal and inexpensive detector @xcite . with an unsurpassed spatial resolution ( about 0.5 @xmath14 m )",
    "nte of the br-2 type provides a complete observation of tracks starting from fission fragments and down to relativistic particles .",
    "nte deserve a further use in fundamental and applied research in state - of - art accelerators and reactors , as well as with sources of radioactivity , including natural ones .",
    "application of nte is especially justified in those pioneering experiments in which nuclear particle tracks can not be reconstructed with the help of electronic detectors .",
    "thus , in the last decade in the framework of the becquerel project in jinr the nte technique allowed one to investigate clustering of the nuclei @xmath6li , @xmath3be , @xmath15b , @xmath16c and @xmath17n in their relativistic dissociation @xcite .",
    "however , the production of nte pellicles which lasted in moscow for four decades was ended more than ten years ago .",
    "the interest in a further application stimulated its reproduction in the micron workshop that is part of the company `` slavich '' ( pereslavl zalessky ) @xcite . at present nte samples",
    "are produced by layers of thickness of 50 to 200 @xmath14 m on glass substrates .",
    "supportless pellicles of thickness of the order of 500 @xmath14 m are expected to be available soon .",
    "verification of novel nte in exposures to relativistic particles confirmed that it is similar to the br-2 one .",
    "the nte technique is based on intelligence , vision and performance of researchers using traditional microscopes . despite widespread interest , its labor consumption causes limited samplings of hundreds of measured tracks which present as a rule only tiny fractions of the available statistics .",
    "implementation of computerized and fully automated microscopes in the nte analysis allows one to bridge this gap .",
    "these are complicated and expensive devices of collective or even remote usage allow one to describe unprecedented statistics of short nuclear tracks",
    ". to make such a development purposeful it is necessary to focus on such a topical issue of nuclear physics the solution of which can be reduced to simple tasks of recognition and measurement of tracks in nte to be solved with the aid of already developed programs .    keeping in mind such a perspective competitiveness of nte in measurements of short and heavy ion tracks on most precise optical microscope ksm with a 90@xmath18 objective",
    "is demonstrated in series of low energy applications . when measuring decays of @xmath1he nuclei implanted in nte the possibilities of were verified and the effect of the @xmath1he atom drift was established @xcite .",
    "correlation of triples were studied in disintegrations of carbon nuclei of nte composition by 14.1 mev neutrons @xcite .",
    "the angular correlations of @xmath6li and @xmath19he nuclei produced in disintegrations of boron nuclei by thermal neutrons were studied in boron enriched nte @xcite . in this series of exposures the angular resolution of nte was confirmed to be perfect by expected physical effects which are manifested in the distributions of the opening angles distributions of the products of the studied reactions .    at cern , a nte sample was exposed to 160 gev muons @xcite .",
    "the nte irradiation with these particles makes it possible to study the multifragmentation of nuclei under the effect of a purely electromagnetic probe .",
    "multiphoton exchanges or transitions of virtual photons to mesons may serve as a fragmentation mechanism .",
    "the nuclear diffraction mechanism rather than the soft electromagnetic mechanism manifests itself for carbon nuclei splittings to triples .",
    "the corroboration of this conclusion is of importance for interpreting not only multifragmentation under the effect of ultrarelativistic muons .",
    "it may also serve as a basis for interpreting the multifragmentation of relativistic nuclei in peripheral interactions not leading to the formation of target fragments ( `` white '' stars ) .",
    "one of the suggested problems is a search for the possibility of a collinear cluster tri - partition @xcite .",
    "the existence of this phenomenon could be established in observations of such a type of ternary fission of heavy nuclei in which a lightest fragment is emitted in the direction of one of the heavy fragments . despite distinct observability of fission fragments",
    "they can not be fully identified in nte . however , nte is valuable due to the combination of the best angular resolution and maximum sensitivity . besides",
    ", it is possible to measure the lengths and thicknesses of tracks , and , thus , to classify the fragments . as an initial stage , to provide statistics of ternary fissions it is suggested to analyze a sufficient nte area exposed to @xmath20cf source with an appropriate density of tracks of and spontaneous fission fragments @xcite . such an approach will be developed by a nte with an admixture of the @xmath20cf isotope @xcite .",
    "another option is exposure by thermal neutrons of nte manufactured with a @xmath21u isotope addition .    on high energy side discussed below novel samples of nte",
    "were exposed quite recently to the secondary beam of relativistic nuclei @xmath11c of the jinr nuclotron which allowed one to include a clustering of the @xmath11c nucleus into the general pattern already relying on data on the light nuclei including radioactive ones .",
    "the @xmath11c data stimulated an additional analysis of previous @xmath4c and @xmath4b exposures .",
    "consideration of the nucleosynthesis chains toward @xmath5b , @xmath5c and @xmath22n via the `` hot breakout '' @xmath6be(@xmath12he,@xmath23)@xmath4c(e@xmath24,@xmath25)@xmath4b assists to recognize relations between their structures and , in particular , importance of the unbound nuclei in them .",
    "the @xmath4c synthesis processing due to an increase of provides an energy `` window '' for the formation of intermediate states with unstable nuclei , and .",
    "these clusters are preserved in subsequent reactions .",
    "the `` window '' of the reaction allows only an association of the @xmath6be and @xmath19he clusters , also contributing to the @xmath11c and @xmath4b structure .",
    "thus , a hidden variety of the virtual configurations in the nuclei @xmath5c and @xmath5b can be populated via electromagnetic transitions from the real ones . in turn , these nuclei provide a basis for capture reactions of protons or the he isotopes ( or in neutron exchange ) for synthesis of the subsequent nuclei which leads to a translation of the preceding structures .",
    "obviously , the unstable nuclei @xmath1be and @xmath2b play a key role in a general pattern of nuclear clustering and despite complicated observability their contribution deserves to be studied in detail over an available variety of light nuclei and physical mechanisms .",
    "the cluster structure of light nuclei including radioactive ones in relativistic - fragmentation processes is a central topic of the becquerel project which continues the tradition of use of the nte technique @xcite .",
    "such reactions are under study by means of nte stacks longwise exposed to primary and secondary beams of relativistic nuclei of the jinr nuclotron . among the events of fragmentation of relativistic nuclei , those of their coherent dissociation to narrow jets of fragments are especially valuable for studying nuclear clustering .",
    "coherent dissociation does not feature either slow fragments of nte composing nuclei or charged mesons .",
    "this empirical feature allows one to assume a glancing character of such collisions and that excitations of relativistic nuclei under study are minimal .",
    "a main underlying mechanism of coherent dissociation is nuclear diffraction interaction processing without nuclear density overlap and angular momentum transfer .",
    "the experimental method in question has already furnished unique information compiled in @xcite about cluster aspects of the structure of the whole family of light nuclei , including radioactive ones .",

    "both 2heh triples in the event correspond to @xmath2b decays . ]",
    "events of coherent dissociation are called `` white '' stars because of the absence of tracks of strongly ionizing particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the term `` white '' star reflects aptly a sharp `` breakdown '' of the ionization density at the interaction vertex upon going over from the primary - nucleus track to secondary tracks within a @xmath26 cone at 1.2 @xmath27 gev .",
    "this special feature generates a fundamental problem for electronic methods because more difficulties should be overcome in detecting events where the degree of dissociation is higher . on the contrary ,",
    "such events in nte are observed and interpreted in the most straightforward way , and their distribution among interaction channels characterized by different compositions of charged fragments is determined exhaustively .",
    "the probability distribution of the final configurations of fragments in `` white '' stars makes it possible to reveal their contributions to the structure of nuclei under consideration .",
    "we assumed that , in the case of dissociation , specific configurations arise at random without sampling and that the dissociation mechanism itself does not lead to the sampling of such states via angular - momentum or isospin exchange . by and large ,",
    "available results confirm the assumption that the cluster features of light nuclei determine the pattern of their relativistic dissociation . at the same time , events that involve the dissociation of deeply bound cluster states and which can not arise at low collision energy are detected .",
