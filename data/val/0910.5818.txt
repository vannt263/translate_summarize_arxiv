    "bepicolombo is an european space agency mission to be launched in 2014 , with the goal of an in - depth exploration of the planet mercury ; it has been identified as one of the most challenging long - term planetary projects .",
    "only two nasa missions had mercury as target in the past , the mariner 10 , which flew by three times in 1974 - 5 and messenger , which carried out its flybys on january and october 2008 , september 2009 before it starts its year - long orbiter phase in march 2011 .",
    "the bepicolombo mission is composed by two spacecraft to be put in orbit around mercury .",
    "the radioscience experiment is one of the on board experiments , which would coordinate a gravimetry , a rotation and a relativity experiment , using a very accurate range and range rate tracking .",
    "these measurements will be performed by a full 5-way link ( @xcite ) to the mercury orbiter ; by exploiting the frequency dependence of the refraction index , the differences between the doppler measurements ( done in ka and x band ) and the delay give information on the plasma content along the radiowave path . in this way most of the measurements errors introduced can be removed , improving of about two orders of magnitude with respect to the past technologies .",
    "the accuracies that can be achieved are @xmath0 cm in range and @xmath1 cm / s in range rate .",
    "how we compute these observables ?",
    "for example , a first approximation of the range could be given by the formula @xmath2 which models a very simple geometrical situation ( see figure  [ fig : range ] ) .",
    "the vector @xmath3 is the mercurycentric position of the orbiter , the vector @xmath4 is the position of the center of mass of mercury ( m ) in a reference system with origin at the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) , the vector @xmath5 is the position of the earth - moon center of mass in the same reference system , @xmath6 is the vector from the earth - moon barycenter ( emb ) to the center of mass of the earth ( e ) , the vector @xmath7 is the position of the reference point of the ground antenna with respect to the center of mass of the earth .        using ( [ eq : new ] ) means to model the space as flat arena ( @xmath8 is an euclidean distance ) and the time as absolute parameter .",
    "this is obviously not possible because it is clear that , beyond some threshold of accuracy , these quantities have to be formulated within the framework of einstein s theory of gravity ( general relativity theory , grt ) .",
    "moreover we have to take into account the different times at which the events have to be computed : the transmission of the signal at the transmit time ( @xmath9 ) , the signal at the mercury orbiter at the time of bounce ( @xmath10 ) and the reception of the signal at the receive time ( @xmath11 ) .    formula ( [ eq : new ] ) could be a good starting point to construct a correct relativistic formulation ; with the word `` correct '' we do not mean all the possible relativistic effects , but the effects that can be measured by the experiment .",
    "this paper deals with the corrections to apply to this formula to obtain a consistent relativistic model for the computations of the observables and the practical implementation of such computations .    in section [ sec : refsys ] we discuss the relativistic four - dimensional reference systems used and the transformations adopted to make the sums in ( [ eq : new ] ) consistent ; according to @xcite , with `` reference system '' we mean a purely mathematical construction , while a `` reference frame '' is a some physical realization of a reference system .",
    "the relativistic contribution to the time delay due to the sun s gravitational field , the shapiro effect , is described in section [ sec : shap ] .",
    "section [ sec : lt ] deals with the theoretical procedure to compute the light - time ( range ) and the doppler shift ( range rate ) . in section",
    "[ sec : num ] we discuss the practical implementation of the algorithms showing how we eliminate rounding - off problems .",
    "the equations of motion for the planets mercury and earth , including all the relativistic effects ( and potential violations of grt ) required to the accuracy of the bepicolombo radioscience experiment have already been discussed in @xcite , thus this paper concentrates on the computation of the observables .",
    "the five vectors involved in formula ( [ eq : new ] ) have to be computed at their own time , the epoch of different events : e.g. , @xmath12 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are computed at both the antenna _ transmit time _",
    "@xmath9 and the _ receive time _",
    "@xmath11 of the signal . @xmath4 and @xmath3 are computed at the _ bounce time _",
    "@xmath10 ( when the signal has arrived to the orbiter and is sent back , with correction for the delay of the transponder ) . to be able to perform the vector sums and differences , these vectors have to be converted to a common space - time reference system , the only possible choice being some realization of the bcrs ( barycentric celestial referece system ) .",
    "we adopt for now a realization of the bcrs that we call ssb ( solar system barycentric ) reference frame and in which the time is tdb ( barycentric dynamic time ) ; other possible choices , such as a tcb ( barycentric celestial time ) , only can differ by linear scaling .",
    "the tdb choice of the ssb timescale entails also the appropriate linear scaling of space - coordinates and planetary masses as described for instance in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the vectors @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath13 are already in ssb as provided by numerical integration and external ephemerides ; thus the vectors @xmath7 and @xmath14 have to be converted to ssb from the geocentric and mercurycentric systems , respectively .",
    "of course the conversion of reference system implies also the conversion of the time coordinate .",
    "there are three different time coordinates to be considered .",
    "the currently published planetary ephemerides are provided in tdb .",
    "the observations are based on averages of clock and frequency measurements on the earth surface : this defines another time coordinate called tt ( terrestrial time ) .",
    "thus for each observation the times of transmission @xmath9 and receiving @xmath11 need to be converted from tt to tdb to find the corresponding positions of the planets , e.g. , the earth and the moon , by combining information from the precomputed ephemerides and the output of the numerical integration for mercury and the earth - moon barycenter .",
    "this time conversion step is necessary for the accurate processing of each set of interplanetary tracking data ; the main term in the difference tt - tdb is periodic , with period 1 year and amplitude @xmath15 s , while there is essentially no linear trend , as a result of a suitable definition of the tdb .",
    "the equation of motion of a mercurycentric orbiter can be approximated , to the required level of accuracy , by a newtonian equation provided the independent variable is the proper time of mercury .",
    "thus , for the bepicolombo radioscience experiment , it is necessary to define a new time coordinate tdm ( mercury dynamic time ) , as described in @xcite , containing terms of 1-pn order depending mostly upon the distance from the sun and velocity of mercury .    from now on we shall call the quantities related to the ssb frame `` tdb - compatible '' , the quantities related to the geocentric frame `` tt - compatible '' , and the quantities related to the mercurycentric frame `` tdm - compatible '' , in accordance with the paper @xcite , and label them tb , tt and tm , respectively .",
    "the differential equation giving the local time @xmath16 as a function of the ssb time @xmath17 , which we are currently assuming to be tdb , is the following : @xmath18\\,\\ , , \\label{eq : dert}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the gravitational potential ( the list of contributing bodies depends upon the accuracy required : in our implementation we use sun , mercury to neptune , moon ) at the planet center and @xmath20 is the ssb velocity of the same planet .",
    "the constant term @xmath21 is used to perform the conventional rescaling motivated by removal of secular terms , e.g. , for the earth we use @xmath22 .",
    "the space - time transformations we have to perform involve essentially the position of the antenna and the position of the orbiter .",
    "the geocentric coordinates of the antenna should be transformed into tdb - compatible coordinates ; the transformation is expressed by the formula @xmath23 where @xmath19 is the gravitational potential at the geocenter ( excluding the earth mass ) , @xmath24 is a scaling factor given as definition , supposed to be a good approximation for removing secular terms from the transformation and @xmath25 is the barycentric velocity of the earth .",
    "the next formula contains the effect on the velocities of the time coordinate change , which should be consistently used together with the coordinate change : @xmath26 \\cdot \\left[{\\frac{d t}{d t}}\\right]\\,\\,.\\ ] ] note that the previous formula contains the factor @xmath27 ( expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dert ] ) ) that deals with time transformation : @xmath16 is the local time for earth , that is tt , and @xmath17 is the corresponding tdb time .",
    "the mercurycentric coordinates of the orbiter should be transformed into tdb - compatible coordinates through the formula @xmath28 where @xmath19 is the gravitational potential at the center of mass of mercury ( excluding the mercury mass ) and @xmath29 could be used to remove the secular term in the time transformation ( thus defining a tm scale , implying a rescaling of the mass of mercury ) .",
    "we believe this is not necessary : the secular drift of tdm with respect to other time scales is significant , see figure 5 in paper @xcite , but a simple iterative scheme is very efficient in providing the inverse time transformation .",
    "thus we set @xmath30 , assuming the reference frame is tdm - compatible . as for the antenna",
    "we have a formula expressing the velocity transformation that contains the derivative of time @xmath16 for mercury , that is tdm , with respect to time @xmath17 , that is tdb : @xmath31 \\cdot   \\left[{\\frac{d t}{d t } } \\right]\\,\\ , .\\ ] ]    in all the formulas for these coordinate changes we have neglected the terms of the ssb acceleration of the planet center ( @xcite ) , because they contain beside @xmath32 the additional small parameter ( distance from planet center)/(planet distance to the sun ) , which is of the order of @xmath33 even for a mercury orbiter .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the shapiro correction for the computation of the range rate is @xmath34 \\,\\,,\\ ] ] where the time derivative is with respect to a tdb time .",
    "this formula is almost never found in the literature and has not been much used in the processing of the past radioscience experiments , such as in @xcite , because the observable range rate is typically computed as difference of ranges divided by time ; however , for reasons explained in section  [ sec : num ] , this formula is now necessary .",
    "since radar measurements are usually referred to the receive time @xmath11 the observables are seen as functions of this time , and the computation sequence works backward in time : starting from @xmath11 , the bounce time @xmath10 is computed iteratively , and , using this information the transmit time @xmath9 is computed .    the vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 are obtained integrating the post - newtonian equations of motions .",
    "the vectors @xmath37 are obtained by integrating the orbit in the mercurycentric tdm - compatible frame .",
    "the vector @xmath38 is obtained from a standard iers model of earth rotation , given accurate station coordinates , and @xmath39 from lunar ephemerides ( @xcite ) .    in the following subsections",
    "we shall describe the procedure to compute the range ( section [ sec : range ] ) and the range rate ( section [ sec : ranger ] ) .",
    "once the five vectors are available at the appropriate times and in a consistent ssb system , there are two different light - times , the up - leg @xmath40 for the signal from the antenna to the orbiter , and the down - leg @xmath41 for the return signal .",
    "they are defined implicitly by the distances down - leg and up - leg @xmath42 @xmath43 respectively , with somewhat different shapiro effects .",
    "then @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the two portions of the light - time , in the time attached to the ssb , that is tdb ; this provides the computation of @xmath9",
    ". then these times are to be converted back in the time system applicable at the receiving station , where the time measurement is performed , which is tt ( or some other form of local time , such as the standard utc ) .",
    "@xmath11 is already available in the local time scale , from the original measurement , while @xmath9 needs to be converted back from tdb to tt .",
    "the difference between these two tt times is @xmath46 , from which we can conventionally define @xmath47 .",
    "note that the difference @xmath48 in tt is significantly different from @xmath49 in tdb , by an amount of the order of @xmath50 s , while the sensitivity of the bepicolombo radioscience experiment is of the order of @xmath51 s , thus these conversions change the computed observable in a significant way , see figure  [ fig : difft ] .        the practical method for solving @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eqs .  ( [ eq : rdo ] ) and ( [ eq : rup ] ) is as follows .",
    "since the measurement is labeled with the receive time @xmath11 , the iterative procedure needs to start from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdo ] ) by computing the states @xmath54 and @xmath7 at epoch @xmath11 , then selecting a rough guess @xmath55 for the bounce time ( e.g. , @xmath56 ) .",
    "then the states @xmath3 and @xmath57 are computed at @xmath55 and a successive guess @xmath58 is given by ( [ eq : rdo ] ) .",
    "this is repeated computing @xmath59 , and so on until convergence , that is , until @xmath60 is smaller than the required accuracy .",
    "this fixed point iteration to solve the implicit equation for @xmath10 is convergent because the motion of the satellite and of mercury , in the time @xmath44 , is a small fraction of the total difference vector . after accepting the last value of @xmath10",
    "we start with the states @xmath3 and @xmath61 at @xmath10 and with a rough guess @xmath62 for the transmit time ( e.g. , @xmath63 ) .",
    "then @xmath54 and @xmath7 are computed at epoch @xmath62 and @xmath64 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rup ] ) , and the same procedure is iterated to convergence , that is to achieve a small enough @xmath65 .",
    "this double iterative procedure to compute range is consistent with what has been used for a long time in planetary radar , as described in the paper @xcite .",
    "we conventionally define @xmath66",
    ".      after the two iterations providing at convergence @xmath10 and @xmath9 are complete , we can proceed to compute the range rate .",
    "we rewrite the expression for the euclidean range ( down - leg and up - leg ) as a scalar product : @xmath67 \\",

    "the light - time equation contains also the shapiro terms , thus the range rate observable contains also additive terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 , with significant effects ( a few cm / s during superior conjunctions ) .",
    "since the equations giving @xmath10 and @xmath9 are still ( [ eq : rdo ] ) and ( [ eq : rup ] ) , in computing the time derivatives , we need to take into account that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , with non - unit derivatives .",

    "we conventionally define @xmath81 .",
    "these equations are compatible with @xcite , taking into account that they use a single iteration .",
    "since the time derivatives of the shapiro effects contain @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the equations ( [ eq : rdodot ] ) and ( [ eq : rupdot ] ) are implicit , thus we can again use a fixed point iteration .",
    "it is also possible to use a very good approximation which solves explicitly for @xmath84 and then for @xmath85 , neglecting the very small contribution of shapiro terms : @xmath86\\;\\left[1 + \\frac{{\\bf \\dot x}_{\\rm ms}(t_b)\\cdot \\hat{\\bf r}_{do}}{c } \\right]^{-1 } \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where the right hand side is weakly dependent upon @xmath84 only through @xmath70 , thus a moderately accurate approximation could be used in the computation of @xmath70 , followed by a single iteration . for the other leg @xmath87 \\\\   & & \\quad \\quad \\ , \\left [   1-\\frac{{\\bf \\dot x}_{\\rm ea}(t_t ) \\cdot\\hat{\\bf r}_{up}}{c }   \\right]^{-1 } \\,\\ , .",

    "this introduces a change in the measured frequencies at both ends , and because this change is not the same ( the earth having moved by about @xmath88 of its orbit ) there is a correction needed to be performed .",
    "the quantity we are measuring is essentially the derivative of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath11 , but this in two different time systems : for readability , we use @xmath16 for tt , @xmath17 for tdb @xmath89 where the derivatives of the time coordinate changes are the same as the right hand sides of the differential equation giving @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 in the first factor and the inverse of the same for the last factor . however , the accuracy required is such that the main term with the gravitational mass of the sun @xmath90 and the position of the sun @xmath91 is enough : @xmath92    \\;{\\frac{d t_t}{d t_r } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\left[1-\\frac{\\mu_0}{|{\\bf x}_{\\rm",

    "\\label{eq : dertimeconv }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we do not need the @xmath22 constant term discussed above because it cancels in the first and last terms in the right hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dertimeconv ] ) .",
    "the correction in the above formula is required for consistency , but in fact the correction has an order of magnitude of @xmath50 cm / s and is negligible for the sensitivity of the bepicolombo radioscience experiment ( figure  [ fig : difft ] ) .",
    "the computation of the observables , as presented in the previous section , is already complex , but still the list of subtle technicalities is not complete .",
    "a problem well known in radioscience is that , for top accuracy , the range rate measurement can not be the instantaneous value @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , the measurement is not instantaneous : an accurate measure of a doppler effect requires to fit the difference of phase between carrier waves , the one generated at the station and the one returned from space , accumulated over some _ integration time _",
    "@xmath94 , typically between @xmath0 and @xmath95 s. thus the observable is really a difference of ranges @xmath96 or , equivalently , an averaged value of range rate over the integration interval @xmath97    in order to understand the computational difficulty we need to take also into account the orders of magnitude . as said in the introduction , for state of the art tracking systems , such as those using a multi - frequency link in the x and ka bands , the accuracy of the range measurements can be @xmath98 cm and the one of range - rate @xmath88 cm / s ( over an integration time of @xmath99 s ) .",
    "let us take an integration time @xmath100 s , which is adequate for measuring the gravity field of mercury ; in fact if the orbital period is @xmath101 s , the harmonics of order @xmath102 have periods as short as @xmath103 s. the accuracy over @xmath104 s of the range rate measurement can be , by gaussian statistics , @xmath105 cm / s , and the required accuracy in the computation of the difference @xmath106 is @xmath107 cm .",
    "the distances can be as large as @xmath108 cm , thus the relative accuracy in the difference needs to be @xmath109 .",
    "this implies that _ rounding off _ is a problem with current computers , with relative rounding off error of @xmath110 ( figure  [ fig : rr3 ] ) ; extended precision is supported in software , but it has many limitations .",
    "the practical consequences are that the computer program processing the tracking observables , at this level of precision and over interplanetary distances , needs to be a mixture of ordinary and extended precision variables .",
    "any imperfection may result in `` banding '' , that is residuals showing a discrete set of values , implying that some information corresponding to the real accuracy of the measurements has been lost in the digital processing .     of the @xmath111 harmonic coefficient : the range rate computed as range difference divided by the integration time of 30 s , eq .",

( [ eq : rrate_mode4 ] ) , is smooth ; the difference is marginally significant with respect to the measurement accuracy.,width=264 ]    as an alternative , the use of a quadrature formula for the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rrate_mode4 ] ) can provide a numerically more stable result , because the s / n of the range rate measurement is @xmath112 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rr4 ] shows that a very small model change , generating a range rate signal @xmath113 micron / s over one pass , can be computed smoothly by using a 7 nodes gauss quadrature formula .",
    "by combining the results of the previous paper ( @xcite ) , and of this one , we have completed the task of showing that it is possible to build a consistent relativistic model of the dynamics and of the observations for a mercury orbiter tracked from the earth , at a level of accuracy and self - consistency compatible with the very demanding requirements of the bepicolombo radioscience experiment .",
    "in particular , in this paper we have given the algorithm definitions for the computation of the observables range and range rate , including the reference system effects and the shapiro effect .",
    "we have shown which computation can be performed explicitly and which ones need to be obtained from an iterative procedure .",
    "we have also shown how to push these computations , when implemented in a realistic computer with rounding - off , to the needed accuracy level , even without the cumbersome usage of quadruple precision .",
    "the list of `` relativistic corrections '' , assuming we can distinguish their effects separately , is long , and we have shown that many subtle effects are relevant to the required accuracy . however , in the end what is required is just to be fully consistent with a post - newtonian formulation to some order , to be adjusted when necessary .",
    "interestingly , the high accuracy of bepicolombo radio system may require implementation of the second post - newtonian effects in range .",
