    "liquid mirror telescope ( lmt ) redshift surveys provide an efficient way to study the distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "recent technological developments at laval university and the university of british columbia ( borra et al .",
    "1992 , hickson et al .",
    "1994 ) have made liquid mirrors a viable low - cost alternative to glass mirrors for zenith - pointing telescopes .",
    "these surveys employ a set of medium - band filters to measure the spectral energy destributions ( seds ) of every detectable object in a long strip of sky a few tenths of a degree wide . from the seds , galaxy types and redshifts",
    "are estimated by fitting spectral templates to the data .",
    "the resulting redshifts have typical redshift accuracy of order 0.01 - 0.03 depending on the wavelength coverage and signal - to - noise ratio ( hickson , gibson and callaghan 1994 ) .",
    "the technique is similar to that of photometric redshifts derived from broad - band filters ( eg .",
    "koo 1985 , lanzetta et al 1996 ) but provides about an order of magnitude improvement in redshift accuracy for the same signal - to - noise ratio . a first such survey",
    ", the ubc - nasa multi - narrowband survey ( hickson & mulrooney , 1998 ) , is nearing its completion , and a new larger - scale project , the lzt survey , which will probe the universe to a much greater depth , is in construction .",
    "the 6-m large zenith telescope ( lzt ) ( hickson et al . 1998 ) is expected to provide redshifts for galaxies as faint as 23rd magnitude .",
    "this is several magnitudes fainter than can be reached by current and planned wide - angle spectroscopic surveys such as the 2df ( maddox 1998 ) and sloan digital sky survey .",
    "however , the photometrically derived redshifts of the ubc - nasa survey and future lzt are less accurate than spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the goal of this study is to determine if , in spite of the substantial redshift errors and of the narrow - strip geometry of the survey region , liquid mirror galaxy redshift surveys have the potential to reveal important information about the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "specifically , we are interested in exploring whether the surveys can distinguish between the predictions of models of structure formation which are characterized by the same primordial power spectrum of mass fluctuations , but which have different phase relations , e.g. on one hand inflationary universe models with gaussian random phases , and on the other hand topological defect theories characterized by rich nontrivial phase correlations .",
    "a second goal of this study is to explore which aspects of the technology future improvement should focus on if the goal of the survey is to gain more information about the origin of structure in the universe . specifically",
    ", what does one gain by increasing the depth of the survey compared to what one would gain by increasing the accuracy of the redshifts by adding more filters .",
    "we study these issues by performing numerical simulations of various theories of structure formation , slicing from the simulation box regions with the geometry of the lmt surveys , and analyzing the results using statistical measures which are sensitive to a non - gaussian distribution of phases .",
    "specifically , we shall evaluate counts - in - cell ( cic ) statistics , n - galaxy probability functions ( npf ) and minkowski functionals ( mecke et al . 1994 ) .",
    "we compare the results of inflation - based cold dark matter ( cdm ) theories and topological defect models .",
    "since the dynamics of actual defect models is very complicated and not yet completely understood , we will investigate toy model realizations constructed to maximize the degree of non - gaussianness .",
    "we study cosmic string and global texture models ( a global monopole theory would be rather similar to the texture model ) . for strings , we study two extreme versions of the theory . the first is a  filament \" model which is realized if the strings have a lot of small - scale structure and therefore are characterized by a small transverse velocity , leading to a filamentary pattern of accretion .",
    "the second is a  wake \" model which is realistic if the strings have little small - scale structure , large transverse velocity , and no local gravitational potential , and thus lead to planar velocity perturbations in their wake .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that already with the current ubc - nasa survey useful lessons for cosmology can be deduced . with a limiting magnitude ( ab magnitude scale ) of 20.4 and galaxy redshift errors of @xmath0 ( based on the use of 33 filters ) ,",
    "the complete survey will allow us to differentiate between the predictions of idealized defect theories and gaussian models . with an improvement of the redshift errors and survey depth which will be possible with the lzt survey",
    ", the distinguishing power of the survey will be greatly increased .",
    "_ standard cold dark matter model",
    "_    there are two main classes of theories of structure formation which have been investigated over the past decade .",
    "the first are inflation - based models with a scale - invariant spectrum of primordial adiabatic perturbations with random phases , each having a gaussian distribution .",
    "these models are viable only if the dark matter is cold ( resulting in the so - called _ cold dark matter _ ( cdm ) models ) . in this paper",
    ", we shall study the  standard \" cdm model with an exactly scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations , @xmath1 , and vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "this specific model is no longer viable if we compare the normalization of the power spectrum of density perturbations with that of cmb fluctuations .",
    "viable cdm models either require an admixture of hot dark matter , a value of @xmath2 smaller than one , a remnant cosmological constant contributing significantly to @xmath2 , or a tilt of the primordial spectrum of perturbations . however , in this paper we are mostly concerned with the power of the lmt survey s to pick up signatures of primordial non - random phases , and the model we study is taken as the canonical model with gaussian random phases .",
    "thus , we consider a cdm model with @xmath1 , @xmath3 , with vanishing cosmological constant , and having an exactly scale - invariant primordial spectrum of cosmological perturbations ( generated as quantum fluctuations in an early period of inflation ( chibisov & mukhanov 1980 , chibisov & mukhanov 1982 , lukash 1980 , mukhanov & chibisov 1981 , guth & pi 1982 , hawking 1982 , starobinskii 1982 , bardeen et al .",
    "the processing of the primordial spectrum of perturbations at late times on scales smaller than the hubble radius leads to a nontrivial transfer function .",
    "we take the transfer function given in bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .",
    "a cosmological model with these parameters was evolved numerically in a box of comoving length of @xmath4mpc with @xmath5 particles .",
    "the normalization of the primordial power spectrum was chosen such that @xmath6 ( note that a cobe normalized model would require @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical work was done with the bertschinger & gelb ( 1991 ) @xmath8 n - body code and was run on the cray - ymp at the brown center for scientific computation .    _ string wake model _    the second class of structure formation models which has received a lot of attention over the past decade",
    "is based on topological defects giving rise to the seeds for structures ( see vilenkin & shellard ( 1994 ) , hindmarsh & kibble ( 1995 ) or brandenberger ( 1994 ) for recent reviews ) .",
    "models based on strings , global monopoles , and textures are of special interest ( models with local monopoles or domain walls are ruled out since the defects in these models would overclose the universe ) .",
    "topological defects are a generic prediction of a wide class of particle physics models . if the set of vacuum states of the theory after symmetry breaking has a nontrivial topology , then defects will inevitably be produced during the symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe ( kibble 1976 ) .",
    "the defects form non - adiabatic density perturbations and act as the seeds of structure formation . if the scale of symmetry breaking is about @xmath9gev , then the resulting spectrum of perturbations has the correct amplitude to explain the large - scale fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background observed by cobe ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "cosmic strings are linear topological defects which arise if the vacuum manifold of the particle physics theory is not simply connected . at the time of the phase transition , a network of strings is formed .",
    "the strings are either infinite in length or closed loops .",
    "the _ long _ string network consists of all the strings whose curvature radius is greater than the hubble radius .",
    "causality considerations show that the correlation length @xmath10 of the long string network ( the mean separation of the long strings ) must be smaller or equal to the hubble radius at all times after the phase transition .",
    "analytical arguments ( vilenkin 1985 ) and numerical studies ( albrecht & turok 1989 , bennett & bouchet 1988 , allen & shellard 1990 ) demonstrate that the string network takes on a _ scaling solution _ in which @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "hence , it follows that the cosmic string model predicts a scale - invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations , much like inflationary universe models .",
    "in contrast to the latter , however , the phases of the perturbations in the string model are non - random .",
    "the precise nature of the non - random phases ( more specifically the topology of the dominant structures produced in the cosmic string model ) depend on some details of the string dynamics which are , unfortunately , not yet resolved .",
    "if the strings are straight on the scale of the hubble radius , then the string tension will equal the mass per unit length @xmath13 . as a consequence , the strings will move relativistically , and they exert no local gravitational force . in contrast , if the long strings have a lot of small - scale structure , then the tension will be smaller than @xmath13 , the transverse motion of the strings will be slower and there will be a local gravitational force exerted by the strings .",
    "the first scenario gives rise to the _ cosmic string wake model _",
    ", the second to the _ cosmic string filament model_.    note that since the strings are non - adiabatic seed perturbations , then , in a model in which the dark matter is hot , free streaming does not erase the primordial perturbations on small scales . hence , the cosmic string model of structure formation is viable even if the dark matter is hot ( vilenkin & shafi 1983 , brandenberger et al .",
    "1987a , 1987b ) .",
    "a straight cosmic string without small - scale structure generates a conical space perpendicular to the string with deficit angle ( vilenkin 1981 ) @xmath14 ( we use units in which the speed of light @xmath15 ) .",
    "if the string is moving through a plasma with transverse velocity @xmath16 , this induces a velocity perturbation ( silk & vilenkin 1984 ) of magnitude @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relativistic @xmath19 factor associated with the velocity @xmath16 .",
    "the velocity perturbations , in turn , leads to a non - adiabatic density perturbation of roughly planar geometry - a wake .",
    "the dimensions of the plane are determined by the string velocity @xmath16 and by the correlation length @xmath10 . a string at time @xmath20 produces a wake of comoving length @xmath21 and width @xmath22 .",
    "the wake thickness can be calculated ( perivolaropoulos et al . 1990 , brandenberger 1991 ) using the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) as the comoving scale of the region which has separated from the hubble flow and is no longer expanding . because of free streaming , the result depends on the nature of the dark matter . for hot dark matter , the thickness at the present time @xmath23 of a wake created at time @xmath24 is ( perivolaropoulos et al . 1990 ,",
    "brandenberger 1991 ) @xmath25 thus , the wake dimensions are @xmath26 the mass of such a structure is @xmath27 where we have taken the string correlation length to be @xmath28 .",
    "hot dark matter wakes created before the time @xmath29 of equal matter and radiation are diluted by the radiation pressure and will not be included in our simulations .",
    "note that in the cosmic string wake model , the structures which dominate the large - scale distribution of galaxies are predicted to be planar wakes .",
    "the most numerous and thickest are those created at @xmath29 .",
    "their size is comparable to that of the great wall ( de lapparent et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "the procedure for setting up a toy wake model simulation is the following .",
    "the time interval between @xmath29 and @xmath23 is divided into hubble times .",
    "for the cosmological parameters used in this paper , there are 16 hubble time steps . at each time step , labeled by a time @xmath20",
    ", a number @xmath30 of wakes are laid down per volume @xmath31 . here",
    ", @xmath32 gives the mean separation of wakes at this time .",
    "wakes are laid down by selecting centers and orientations of the wakes at random within each volume @xmath31 . for given values of @xmath33 , of the mean transverse velocity of the string @xmath16 and of the number @xmath34",
    ", the value of @xmath35 can be determined by demanding that the total mass density adds up to critical density .    in principle , the number @xmath34 could be determined by numerical simulations . in practice , however , the resolution of the cosmic string evolution codes may not be good enough to give a reliable answer .",
    "thus , we will consider a range of values . to be specific , we choose the following values : @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath34 .    given the geometrical distribution of wakes , galaxies are laid down at random within the volume of the wakes , with a uniform density .",
    "_ string filament model _    long cosmic strings with a substantial amount of small - scale structure ( e.g. small - scale wiggles ) will have a coarse - grained equation of state which differs from that of a relativistic string , i.e. @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the string tension . in this case",
    ", the strings will have a small transverse velocity , but they will exert a local gravitational attraction , and hence they will seed filamentary density perturbations .",
    "we shall take the extreme situation in which the transverse string velocity is negligible ( the intermediate case was analyzed in zanchin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) . in this case",
    ", the comoving radius @xmath40 of a filament seeded at time @xmath20 can again be calculated using the zeldovich approximation , yielding ( aguirre & brandenberger 1995 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the mass in an individual filament which was seeded at time @xmath20 is @xmath43 where @xmath34 is defined as in the previous subsection .",
    "the procedure for setting up the string filament simulation is analogous to how the wake toy model is constructed . at each hubble time step between @xmath29 and @xmath23 , a fixed number @xmath44 of filaments for volume @xmath45",
    "is laid down , choosing filament centers and directions at random . for given values of @xmath46 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the number of filaments is determined by demanding that the total mass adds up to critical density .",
    "galaxies are again put down at random in the volume of the filaments , with a uniform density . to be specific",
    ", we shall consider the values @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that the string filament and string wake models represent opposite extremes of what we expect a realistic string model to look like .",
    "the statistical study of the wake and filament models will hence yield as a byproduct a quantitative measure of the large uncertainty in the predictions of the string model , in particular if we let @xmath34 vary over a significant range of values .",
    "_ texture model _",
    "textures ( davis 1987 ) are topological defects which arise if the vacuum manifold of the particle physics model has nontrivial third homotopy group . in four space - time dimensions ,",
    "textures are unstable ( turok 1989 ) . texture configurations on hubble scale unwind within approximately one hubble expansion time . nevertheless , in theories with a global symmetry",
    ", textures are able to generate density perturbations . in field theories with a local symmetry , texture configurations in the scalar matter fields can be compensated by gauge fields on a microscopic time scale , and hence in such models textures are not important for structure formation .",
    "the simplest texture configurations ( turok 1989 ) are spherically symmetric .",
    "hence , we will construct a texture toy model by superimposing individual spherically symmetric texture configurations .",
    "obviously , this is a gross simplification of what a texture model will really look like .    at each time",
    "@xmath20 , there is a finite probability ( prokopec 1991 , leese and prokopec 1991 ) @xmath49 that in a volume @xmath31 there will be a texture configuration .",
    "the initial texture configuration can be modeled ( gooding et al .",
    "1991 ) by a spherically symmetric velocity perturbation which then develops into a spherically symmetric density perturbations .",
    "the comoving radius @xmath40 of this perturbation can again be determined ( aguirre 1995 ) by the zeldovich approximation , yielding the result @xmath50 where ( up to factors of order unity ) @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the scale of symmetry breaking .",
    "we will take the value @xmath53 , an appropriate value for a cobe - normalized texture model ( pen et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the mass in a texture can be computed by multiplying the volume of the texture by the background density .",
    "the texture toy model was obtained by laying down @xmath49 texture centers per volume @xmath31 at each hubble expansion time @xmath20 with a random choice of the centers .",
    "galaxies were distributed within each texture with a gaussian density profile ( as a function of radius ) and random angular distribution . to agree with",
    "the total mass obtained in the other toy models , the number of galaxies per texture was chosen to ( for fixed values of @xmath54 and @xmath49 ) yield critical density for the entire volume .",
    "_ general comments _    note that all four models discussed above predict a roughly scale - invariant primordial spectrum of perturbations . in the case of inflation , the reason for the scale invariance can be explained by the basic geometry of an inflationary cosmology ( see e.g. press ( 1980 ) or brandenberger ( 1985 ) ) , in defect models the approximate scale - invariance is a direct consequence of the scaling dynamics of the defect system ( see e.g. brandenberger ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "however , the morphology in these four models is very different , and with the statistics discussed below we are able to differentiate between their predictions for the large - scale structure of the universe .",

    "each lmt slice was projected into a two - dimensional plane and then divided into equal volume cells ( three - dimensional volume ) .",
    "an equal number of cells in radial and angular direction was chosen .",
    "note that the shape of the cells depends strongly on the redshift , i.e. the cells are not isometric .",
    "however , since we are comparing the predictions of different models ( and eventually with observations ) all treated the same way , the unusual cell shape distribution should not be a problem .",
    "the cic statistic is a histogram of number of cells with @xmath55 galaxies as a function of the number @xmath55 .",
    "the cic statistic can be evaluated for any cell size ( smoothing length ) . since the difference in the predictions of the models",
    "is expected to be most important on scales slightly less than the size of the dominant structures expected in our models , i.e. of comoving length scale @xmath56 , a smoothing length comparable to this scale must be chosen .",
    "we took 34 cells per side which corresponds to a cell length of about @xmath57mpc .",
    "_ n - galaxy probability function _",
    "the second measure we used is the n - galaxy probability function ( npf ) , a generalization of the void probability function ( hamilton et al .",
    "the npf ( aguirre 1995 ) of a galaxy distribution is the probability that there are exactly @xmath58 galaxies in a randomly placed volume @xmath59 , considered as a function of @xmath59 . instead of plotting the npf s ,",
    "we have found it more informative to plot the cumulative npf , which for fixed value of @xmath58 is the probability that there are less than or equal to @xmath58 galaxies within a randomly placed volume @xmath59 .",

    "finally , the fourth minkowski functional is related to the euler characteristic @xmath70 and hence to the genus @xmath71 where @xmath72    there are many ways of displaying the minkowski functionals as a function for the density contrast .",

    "= 3.3 in    = 3.3 in    to obtain the best differentiation between the various models ( independent of @xmath94 ) it is again advisable to look at the slope of the curve rather than at the amplitude for a fixed cell volume . the value of @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 is the number of cells per side ) , which is a measure of the inverse of the slope , taken in the range over which the cumulative npf increases from 0.2 to 0.8 , varies between 4 and 5.7 for the string models , whereas it is approximately 8.7 for the cdm simulation and 15.5 for the texture model .",
    "figures 11 - 14 show the four minkowski functionals @xmath108 evaluated for all four models in the case of the specifications of the ubc - nasa survey with improved redshift errors ( @xmath109 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "the power of the functionals @xmath110 ( in particular @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) to differentiate between the models is comparable if not greater than the power of either the cic or npf statistics .",
    "in fact , using @xmath112 the ubc - nasa survey already offers the potential of separating the predictions of string , texture and cdm models .",
    "= 3.3 in    = 3.3 in",
    "in this paper we have investigated the potential of the ubc - nasa and the lzt liquid mirror telescope redshift surveys to be able to differentiate between the predictions of various models of structure formation , in spite of the relatively large redshift uncertainties inherent to the survey strategy .",
    "we focused on the use of topological statistics to distinguish between models with identical power spectra but different phase structure , resulting in different morphology of the predicted large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "one of our main results is that the current ubc - nasa liquid mirror telescope survey will already be able to yield first interesting results . in particular , using counts in cell ( cic ) , n - galaxy probability functions and minkowski functionals , the predictions of the texture model can be separated from those of other models with a high statistical significance .",
    "we have seen that an improvement in the redshift accuracy by a factor of 3 can yield a substantial increase in the ability of the survey to distinguish between different models . with the current limiting magnitude of @xmath109 but with an improved redshift error of @xmath92 , the ubc - nasa survey will be able to yield results by means of which ( making use of cic , npf and minkowski functional statistics ) the cosmic string models , texture models and standard cdm models can all be differentiated .",
    "in fact , the resolution power is larger than what can be achieved with @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "we have seen that with a survey having the target par ameters of the lzt project ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 a lot can be learned about the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "a very promising statistic appears to be @xmath112 , the third minkowski functionals which measures the integrated mean curvature . with @xmath112 ,",
    "the current ubc - nasa survey already has the potential of discriminating between string , texture and cdm models .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath112 appears to be a more powerful statistic than the widely used genus statistic @xmath113 .",
    "there are , however , some important caveats concerning this study .",
    "the topological defect models we have analyzed are _ toy models _ and not actual simulations which include the complete nonlinear defect and gravitational dynamics ( such simulations are at the moment out of the range of the capabilities ) .",
    "our toy models are intended to capture the crucial morphological differences in the predicted large - scale structure between the models , differences which will be imprinted on the cic , npf and minkowski functional statistics which are sensitive to the morphology of structure .",
    "our defect toy models to not include any super - hubble scale correlations .",
    "neither do they include correlations of the defect distribution at different hubble times ( such correlations would be expected to be quite important in string models and probably less important in the texture model ) .",
    "we have neglected the effects of small - scale fluctuations ( imprinted before @xmath29 ) which can be very important ( in particular in a cosmic string mo del with cold dark matter ( albrecht & stebbins 1992 ) ) , and we have replaced the nonlinear dynamics of the structures seeded by an individual defect by an ad - hoc distribution of galaxies within these structures motivated by calculations using the zeldovich approximation , thus omitting extra nonlinear gravitational clustering .",
    "it would be interesting to redo the analyses of this paper using improved simulations of defect models .",
    "it would also be interesting to study the potential of the lzt project to differentiate between the predictions of different cdm models ( open cdm , @xmath114 , mixed dark matter models ) .",
    "work on these issues is in progress .",
    "we are grateful to martin gtz for running the cdm simulation for us .",
    "we thank ed bertschinger for the use of his code ( bertschinger & gelb 1991 ) , thomas buchert and collaborators for making their minkowski functional codes publically available , and gerry guralnik for granting us access to the computing facilities of the brown center for scientific computation .",
