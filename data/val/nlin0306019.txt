    "nowadays powerful micromanipulation techniques allow for the selective excitation of dna in single molecule experiments under controlled conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "particularly mechanical properties of dna molecules under tension and the inducement of structural transitions with external stress have received a lot of attention @xcite-@xcite . in this context",
    "several force measurements were performed on single dna molecules to examine their elastic response to applied stretching @xcite and twisting forces , respectively @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that with the application of stronger forces to the molecule in stretching experiments , even highly cooperative conformational transitions were discovered , for which , e.g. , b - dna is converted into a new overstretched conformation called s - dna @xcite . furthermore , with sufficiently high tension",
    "the mechanical unzipping of single dna molecules is achievable @xcite .",
    "the opening process of dna has been the subject of a number of studies due to its immense relevance for the transcription process .",
    "simple models taking into account the elasticity properties of dna , such as the wormlike and rodlike chain model , respectively have been invoked to describe these unzipping experiments @xcite .",
    "the statistical mechanics of the torque induced denaturation of dna has been studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , a semi - microscopic model of the binding between the two strands has been used to explain the effects of applied tension to dna unzipping @xcite . in order to determine the geometry and deformability of dna at a local level , i.e. in terms of base pairs , energy functions based on discrete network models",
    "have been derived in @xcite-@xcite . in an early network model for the base pair opening in dna involving microscopic degrees of freedom , peyrard and bishop ( pb )",
    "proposed a planar ladder - like oscillator model of dna assigning each base pair a vertical inter - strand vibrational degree of freedom which simulates the stretchings and compressings of the corresponding h - bridges @xcite .",
    "the binding forces of the hydrogen bridges are described by a morse potential .",
    "the bases itself are treated as point masses .",
    "horizontally , the bases on the same strand are coupled via the stacking interaction described by harmonic potentials .",
    "the pb model has been extensively studied and localized oscillating solutions ( breathers ) have been found reflecting successfully some typical features of the dna opening dynamics such as the magnitude of the amplitudes and the time scale of the breathing of the bubble occurring prior to thermal denaturation @xcite . on the other hand , as the coiled form of double - stranded dna is concerned , it has been found that the bubble formation is strongly correlated with twist deformations and local openings are always connected with a local untwist of the double helix @xcite,@xcite . in order to account for the helicoidal structure of dna",
    "the pb model has been significantly extended by barbi , cocco and peyrard ( bcp ) @xcite . in their model of the twisted form of dna ( the watson - crick double helix ) , two degrees of freedom per base pair are introduced .",
    "there is a radial variable measuring the distance between two h - bridged bases along a line that connects them in the base plane being perpendicular to the helix axis .",
    "further , the twist angle between this connecting line and a reference direction determines the orientation of the h - bridge . in this model",
    "a further degree of freedom has been included , namely the axial distance variation @xcite .",
    "interactions between the bases are described then by appropriate potential terms in the energy of the system .",
    "the process of dna unzipping by applied force has been studied in great detail @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the merit of these works is that many of the theoretical conclusions , gained on the basis of rather simple network models , are in agreement with the experimental results .    in the current study of the nonlinear dynamics related with the opening process and elasticity features of dna molecules",
    "our aim is to examine the energy exchange processes and the relaxation dynamics in dna molecules after they have been brought into a non - equilibrium conformation by applied tension .",
    "such an investigation is associated with recent mechanical experiments performed with single dna molecules @xcite-@xcite forced away from their equilibrium conformations . following force applications energy redistribution within",
    "the dna molecule takes place such that a ( new ) equilibrium conformation is attained @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we focus our interest on the elasticity properties and the relaxation dynamics of two different double - stranded dna configurations , namely the planar untwisted ( ladder - like ) system and the twisted one arising when the two strands of the molecule are coiled around its molecular axis .",
    "in particular we address the questions in which way these two different dna molecules react to imposed stress and how fast the equilibration process takes place for them .",
    "furthermore , we compare the original equilibrium structures with those newly attained after release from the exerted mechanical stress . regarding the biological functioning of dna their elasticity properties are of importance for instance for the creation of a denatured bubble appearing prior to strand separation making the dna accessible to the transcription and replication processes .",
    "compared to previous theoretical studies of the unzipping dynamics of dna induced by strong forces yielding complete strand separation @xcite,@xcite we remark that for the current study we rather concentrate on mechanically stressed double - stranded dna which gets forced away from the equilibrium configuration , however , only with beginning strand separation . from a biophysical point of view",
    "this also resembles the situation when the dna molecule is inflicted to internal stress changes occurring in the living cell which alone is not strong enough to cause advanced bond breaking .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between dna and proteins such as enzymes can exert forces that initiate the local opening of the dna molecule .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section we describe our network model for the structure of double - stranded dna .",
    "the third section deals with the relaxation dynamics within dna molecules forced into locally distorted configurations .",
    "we study the similarities and differences between the relaxation dynamics for a planar ladder - like dna molecule and a twisted one .",
    "finally , we summarize our results .",
    "our dna model takes the basic geometrical features of the double - stranded form of dna , as a polymeric molecule composed of two strands of nucleotides , into account which are essential to model structural deformations generated by mechanical stress imposition and vibrational relaxation processes .",
    "likewise the approach in @xcite,@xcite , we treat the double - stranded dna as a network of coupled oscillators incorporating essential microscopic degrees of freedom of dna and the inherent interactions between them .",
    "such a network model approach is appealing because it can successfully describe the mechanical behavior on the microscopic scale relevant for biomolecular processes , but bears enough simplicity to be tractable with not too much computational efforts .",
    "the constituents of the oscillator network model represent the nucleotides which are regarded as single nondeformable entities .",
    "thus , no inner dynamical degrees of freedom of the nucleotides are taken into account which is justified by the time scale separation between the small - amplitude and fast vibrational motions of the individual atoms and the slower and relatively large - amplitude motions of the atom groups constituting the nucleotides @xcite . concerning the structural components , each nucleotide",
    "is composed of a sugar , a phosphate and a base .",
    "the sugar - phosphate groups of neighboring nucleotides on the same strand are linked via covalent bonds establishing the rigid backbone to the strand .",
    "there is a base attached to every sugar .",
    "since , for simplicity , we do not distinguish between the four different types of bases , the nucleotides are considered as identical objects of fixed mass .",
    "two bases on opposite strands are linked via hydrogen bonds holding the two strands of dna together .",
    "for computational convenience we cast the double helix structure in a cartesian coordinate system whose @xmath0axis coincides with the central helix axis as sketched in fig.@xmath1 .",
    "the base pairs are situated in planes perpendicular to the central helix axis and the vertical distance between two consecutive planes is given by @xmath2 . for the equilibrium configuration each base has equilibrium",
    "coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the index pair @xmath6 labels the @xmath7-th base on the @xmath8th strand with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of base pairs considered .",
    "the equilibrium distance between two bases within a base pair , @xmath12 , is determined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the projections of the line connecting the two bases on the @xmath16axes of the coordinate system .",

    "we introduce the quantity @xmath23 as the angle between the @xmath24axis ( as the reference direction ) and the line connecting two ( displaced ) bases of a base pair measuring the alignment of the associated h - bridge .",
    "@xmath25 is an integer to assure monotonicity of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the three - dimensional equilibrium distance between two adjacent bases on the same strand is given by @xmath27 and deviations from @xmath28 are determined by @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "the deformations of the hydrogen bonds corresponding to deviations @xmath35 from the equilibrium bond length @xmath12 are described by vibrations in a morse potential which is given by @xmath36 ^ 2\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : uhyd}\\ ] ] d is the depth of the morse potential and @xmath37 is the range parameter . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we do not distinguish between the two different pairings in dna , namely the g - c and the a - t pairs .",
    "the former pair involves three hydrogen bonds while the latter involves only two .",
    "thus our model applies to pure poly(dg - dc ) and poly(da - dt ) dna sequences .",
    "the covalent bonds between the sugar - phosphate groups of neighboring nucleotides on a strand are rather strong and rigid ( with bond energies of the order of @xmath38 ) in comparison with the weak and flexible hydrogen bonds ( with bond energies of the order of @xmath39 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems justified to treat the potential of the covalent bonds , simulated by elastic rods , in the harmonic approximation given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the elasticity coefficient .",

    "we study the energy exchange process taking place after the double - stranded dna has been forced mechanically into a non - equilibrium configuration . in more detail",
    ", we consider the situation when at one end ( referred to as the _ pulled end _ ) of short dna molecules consisting of @xmath77 up to @xmath78 base pairs the two strands get pulled laterally in opposite directions by an external force ( exerted e.g. when the two strands of one end of the molecule are attached to two different solid supports that are progressively separated @xcite ) so that they are dragged apart leading to gradual opening of the double - stranded chain .",
    "the pulled end is formed by the base pairs with index @xmath79 and the rest of the molecule with @xmath80 is located above it in the @xmath81 direction .",
    "therefore a positive value of @xmath82 will represent a local @xmath81-stretching of the strand @xmath83 . in order to mimic the pulling process",
    "we assume that the pulling force is directed solely along the @xmath24direction and the @xmath24coordinates of the terminal bases are shifted uniformly with a pulling velocity of @xmath84 while the corresponding @xmath85 and @xmath81 coordinates are kept fixed at @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , due to the constraint imposed by the backbone rigidity there result deformations not only at the pulled end but also for the rest of the helix .",
    "in general , the extent of lateral deformations subsides along the strands from the pulled towards the free end .",
    "the motion of the pulling unit is assumed to terminate when the lateral elongation at the pulled end has reached a certain value , taken as @xmath87 , so that the corresponding terminal hydrogen bond is broken .",
    "moreover , the next - neighboring hydrogen bond is broken too and the third one is already considerably stretched .",
    "the typical resulting deformation pattern of the double stranded dna is depicted in figs.@xmath88 and @xmath89 for the ladder and twisted configuration , respectively .",
    "( in the figures energy is expressed in terms of @xmath90 , the unit for length is @xmath91 and the time is given in @xmath92 . )    comparing the resulting dna deformations we note that for both , the ladder and the twisted configuration , virtually equal lateral elongations are obtained . however , unlike the ladder configuration the twisted one experiences additional changes of the twist angles .",
    "there arises an overall decrease in the twist angle and the further a base pair is apart from the pulled end the more is the corresponding twist angle reduced ( cf .",
    "fig.@xmath93 ) leading to an untwist of the helix .",
    "nevertheless , with growing distance from the pulled end the difference between two consecutive angle changes becomes smaller .",
    "thus the relative twist angle between two adjacent base planes diminishes towards the free end .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      for a parameter study we have varied the stacking interaction strength @xmath60 and simulated the pulling process to follow afterwards the relaxation dynamics .",
    "as the main result we found that the larger @xmath60 is the more rapid proceeds the relaxation process , viz .",
    "the faster is the quasi - equilibrium regime attained .",
    "furthermore , it holds in general that the energy migration takes more time in the case of the ladder system than for its twisted counterpart .    with view to a dependence on the molecule length @xmath11 , i.e. the number of base pairs , we remark that the time scale for the relaxation process remains basically the same when @xmath11 is varied in the range from @xmath77 to @xmath78 providing strong evidence for the enormous elasticity of dna molecules on the lower amplitude scale . in contrast , for large - amplitude elongations the dissociation time of dna molecules increases from a fraction of a second to hours over the range of @xmath94 to @xmath95 base pairs @xcite .    in addition , with regard to asymmetry we investigated also cases when the ends of the strands are pulled laterally with unequal forces ( in the extreme case only one strand is pulled ) resulting in elongation patterns being asymmetric with respect to the central helix axis .",
    "we observed then that the systems behave during the subsequent relaxation dynamics like in the symmetric cases discussed above and attain finally quasi - equilibrium regimes being not far away from the respective original equilibrium configurations with fluctuating structural coordinates .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that within the frame of an oscillator network model we are able to study numerically the mechanical stability and elasticity properties of dna molecules .",
    "our model of coupled oscillators takes essential microscopic degrees of freedom of dna and the inherent interactions between them into account .",
    "we have focused our interest on the opening - closing dynamics of double - stranded dna molecules .",
    "the opening of a dna molecule has been forced by mechanical stress imposed at a terminal end of the molecule bringing it into a non - equilibrium state .",
    "we have followed the subsequent relaxation towards an equilibrium state with recombination to its double - stranded conformation .",
    "the similarities and differences between the relaxation dynamics for a planar ladder - like dna molecule and a twisted one have been discussed .",
    "in particular we have shown that the attainment of a quasi - equilibrium regime proceeds faster in the case of the twisted dna form than for its ladder counterpart .",
    "this has led us to the conclusion that in the twisted form the dna molecule is more flexible with respect to conformational changes than in the planar ladder - like version .    there are some limitations in our model approach and for an improvement one should certainly consider the dependence on the dna sequence , the impact of the chemical environment and the influence of temperature on the mechanical stability .",
