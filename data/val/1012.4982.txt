    "we consider the motion of an incompressible fluid in a bounded two - dimensional domain with some nonlinear boundary conditions , specified as the _ slip boundary condition of friction type _",
    "( sbcf ) or the _ leak boundary condition of friction type _ ( lbcf ) .",
    "these boundary conditions were introduced by h.  fujita in @xcite , and subsequently , many studies have focused on the properties of the solution , for example , existence , uniqueness , regularity , and continuous dependence on data , for the stokes and navier - stokes equations under such boundary conditions .",
    "details can be referred to in @xcite itself or in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "similar types of nonlinear boundary condition , such as subdifferential boundary condition or tresca boundary condition , have been reported in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "the frictional boundary conditions under consideration have been successfully applied to some flow phenomena in environmental and medical problems such as oil flow over or beneath sand layers and blood flow in the thoracic aorta .",
    "such applications have been discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the finite difference method is used for discretization , and theoretical considerations such as convergence are not addressed .    on the other hand ,",
    "few studies have focused on the theoretical analysis of numerical methods for these boundary conditions , even if restricted to the stokes problem .",
    "for example , li and li @xcite proposed a finite element approximation combined with a penalty method for the stokes equation with sbcf .",
    "they proved the optimal order error estimate ; however , they did not focus on a numerical realization of their finite element approximation .",
    "the purpose of this work is to construct a comprehensive theory of the finite element method applied to flow problems with sbcf and lbcf , including all of the existence and uniqueness result , error analysis , and numerical implementation . in doing so , herein",
    ", we restrict our consideration to the stationary stokes equation in a two - dimensional polygon .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the results for the continuous problems described in @xcite .",
    "weak formulations by an elliptic variational inequality for sbcf and lbcf are also presented . in section 3 , we prepare the finite element framework using the so - called p2/p1 element , and state several technical lemmas .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of approximate problems for sbcf .",
    "we propose the discretized variational inequality problem , proving the existence and uniqueness of a solution . in the error analysis",
    ", we first derive a primitive result of the convergence rate @xmath0 under the @xmath1-@xmath2 regularity assumption with @xmath3 .",
    "second , we show that it is improved to @xmath4 under the additional hypothesis of good behavior of the sign of the tangential velocity component on the boundary where sbcf is imposed . a sufficient condition to obtain @xmath5 , which is of optimal order when",
    "@xmath6 , is also considered .",
    "finally , we propose an iterative uzawa - type algorithm to perform numerical computations , and prove that the iterative solution indeed converges to the desired approximate solution .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the study of approximate problems for lbcf , in a manner similar to section 4 .",
    "however , it should be noted that unlike in the case of sbcf , we have to explicitly deal with an additive constant for the pressure . as a result , sometimes there exist multiple solutions for the pressure , especially its additive constant ; other times it is uniquely determined . moreover , in an error analysis , we can only obtain the convergence rate @xmath7 , because of the error of the additive constant of the pressure .",
    "if we can eliminate the influence of this error , the same rate - of - convergence as in the case of sbcf is realized .    in section 6 ,",
    "several numerical examples are provided to support our theory .",
    "we observe that the results of our computation capture the features of sbcf and lbcf and that the numerically calculated errors decrease at @xmath8 for both .",
    "section 7 presents the conclusions and discusses some future works .",
    "the author learned about ayadi et al .",
    "@xcite after the completion of the present study .",
    "they treat the finite element approximation for the stokes equations with sbcf , using the p1 bubble / p1 element .",
    "some numerical examples are presented , and an error estimate is announced without a proof .",
    "let @xmath9 be a _ polygonal _ domain in @xmath10 . throughout this paper , we are concerned with the stokes equations written in a familiar form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the viscosity constant ; @xmath13 , the velocity field ; @xmath14 , the pressure ; and @xmath15 , the external force . as for the boundary , we assume that @xmath16 is a union of two non - overlapping parts , that is , @xmath17 where @xmath18 are relatively nonempty open subsets of @xmath19 . moreover , @xmath20 is assumed to coincide with _ whole one side _ of the polygon @xmath9 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "two endpoints of the line segment @xmath20 are respectively denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; the meaning of these subscripts is clarified in section [ sec3.1 ] .",
    "we impose the adhesive boundary condition on @xmath23 , namely , @xmath24 whereas on @xmath25 , we impose one ( and only one ) of the following boundary conditions of friction type : @xmath26 called the _ slip boundary condition of friction type _ ( sbcf ) , and @xmath27 called the _ leak boundary condition of friction type _ ( lbcf ) .",
    "the function @xmath28 , called the _ modulus of friction _ , is assumed to be continuous on @xmath20 and strictly positive on @xmath25 .    here , the definitions of the symbols appearing above are as follows : @xmath29    \\(i ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant vectors because @xmath25 is a segment .",

    "\\(iii ) in ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) , @xmath28 acts as the threshold of the tangential and normal stress beyond which non - trivial slip and leak on @xmath25 may occur , respectively .",
    "this is why the boundary conditions ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) are said to be  frictional . \"",
