    "the nearby giant elliptical galaxy cen a ( ngc5128 ) contains a warped disk of dust and dense gas .",
    "optically the disk is seen as obscuration against a background of the old stellar population belonging to the elliptical galaxy .",
    "the presence of h@xmath5 emission in the disk ( cf .",
    "nicholson et al . 1992 ) suggest that formation of massive stars are currently taking place in the disk .",
    "the disk is also a source of molecular line emission .",
    "several studies have shown that it contains about @xmath6  of .",
    "the distribution of the molecular gas has been traced by the co emission ( eckart et al .",
    "1990a , quillen et al .",
    "1992 , rydbeck et al . 1993 , wild et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the emission extends to a galactocentric distance of approximately 1kpc .",
    "the molecular gas distribution and its kinematics is consistent with a thin disk which is severly warped ( quillen et al .",
    "the main components are a ring or spiral arm at a galactocentric distance of @xmath7800pc  ( adopting a distance of 3mpc to cen a , which means that 1  corresponds to 14.5pc . ) and a circumnuclear ring at a radius of @xmath7100pc ( israel et al .",
    "1990 , rydbeck et al .",
    "the inner ring is seen as high velocity wings in spectra towards the center when the angular resolution is better than 2530  .",
    "it has also been imaged with the aid of deconvolution of single dish co(21 ) data ( rydbeck et al .",
    "the inner ring is inclined relative to the outer disk but aligned perpendicular to the inner radio jet .",
    "the molecular gas properties of the disk appears to be similar to those found in normal spiral galaxies ( cf .",
    "israel et al . 1990 ,",
    "eckart et al . 1990 , wild et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the radio core is hidden behind a large column of dense obscuring gas .",
    "the combination of a strong radio continuum source and a large column of dense gas makes the line of sight towards the center of cen a a rich source of molecular absorption lines .",
    "the properties of the gas seen in absorption is still largely unknown .",
    "several studies have come up with conflicting results , both concerning the location of the absorption components relative to the nucleus as well as the temperature and density of the gas .",
    "the hi absorption towards the nucleus shows three absorption components ; one strong at the systemic velocity around 552  and two redshifted ones at 596 and 609 , respectively . towards the inner jet , only the main absorption at 552",
    "is seen ( van der hulst et al . 1983 ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence that the main 552  line is situated far out in the disk , while the redshifted lines are situated very close to the nucleus , possibly falling in to the center .",
    "however , seaquist & bell ( 1990 ) report a detection of redshifted h@xmath8co @xmath92 cm absorption against the inner jet at a velocity of @xmath7576 .",
    "this is not necessarily a proof against the redshifted component being situated close to the nucleus .",
    "the inner jet is seen at a projected distance of @xmath720  from the core , which corresponds to @xmath7300pc .",
    "the inner molecular disk can be extended on these scales ( cf .",
    "israel et al .",
    "1991 , rydbeck et al .",
    "1993 , hawarden et al .",
    "the molecular absorption lines seen in the millimeter range only occurs towards the radio core of cen a , since the inner jet has a steep radio spectrum with a completely negligible continuum flux at mm wavelengths .    molecular absorption lines seen in our galaxy ( cf .",
    "lucas & liszt 1996 ) and towards high redshift galaxies ( wiklind & combes 1996ab , 1995 , combes & wiklind 1996 ) almost exclusively arise in very cold gas ( in terms of excitation temperature ) .",
    "although the abundance ratio of hcn / hnc imply that the kinetic temperature can be in the range 1020k , the excitation temperature is comparable to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this suggests diffuse gas with n(h@xmath8 ) @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "are the molecular absorption lines seen in cen a likewise coming from diffuse gas ?",
    "unfortunately very few multiline transitions of the same molecule have been observed .",
    "one exception is h@xmath8co , for which seaquist & bell ( 1990 ) derive an upper limit to the excitation temperature of 3.9k .",
    "several oh absorption features have been detected by van langevelde et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , their interpretation is complicated by the presence of maser lines .",
    "some come from diffuse gas , and some features point to dense clumps ( n(h@xmath8 ) @xmath4 10@xmath12 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the three lowest rotational lines of co have been seen in absorption , both the lines around the systemic velocity and the redshifted components .",
    "the mere detection of the co(32 ) line ( cf .",
    "israel et al . 1991 ) implies that the excitation temperature is relatively high ( 1020k ) . for co , however , the analysis is complicated by confusion with emission , especially for the two lowest transitions .    in this paper",
    "we present new high quality observations of the hco@xmath2(10 ) , hcn(10 ) , hnc(10 ) and cs(21 ) absorption lines , as well as the previously unobserved h@xmath3co@xmath2(10 ) transition , in order to shed some light on the physical properties and location of the molecular absorption towards the radio core of cen a.    in sect.2 we present the observations , in sect.3 we identify the different absorption components and question their possible time variations and in sect.4 we derive column densities and abundance ratios . in sect.5",
    "we discuss the implied properties of the absorbing gas in cen a , and its assumed distance from the center .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",

    "+ column densities for hi derived assuming @xmath14k .",
    "+ b )  center velocities for the hco@xmath2 and hi lines ( see fig.10 ) .",
    "the presence of two absorption complexes in cen a , one at the systemic velocity and one redshifted relative to the systemic velocity , has led to speculations that the redshifted component arises in gas falling into the nucleus of cen a , possibly feeding a supermassive black hole ( cf .",
    "van der hulst et al .",
    "1983 , van gorkom et al . 1989 ) .",
    "one argument is that the redshifted hi component is only seen towards the radio core and not against the inner jet ( van der hulst et al .",
    "the detection of @xmath92 cm h@xmath8co in absorption against the inner jet ( seaquist & bell 1990 ) is not necessarily a proof against the infall hypothesis , if the inner circumnuclear molecular disk is extended on scales of @xmath7300pc . on the other hand , the lack of redshifted hi absorption against the inner jet could also mean that while the size of the hi component at the systemic velocity is @xmath15300pc ( in order to cover both the jet and the core ) , the extent of the redshifted gas is smaller .",
    "hi absorption has been detected in 9 elliptical galaxies ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1989 , mirabel 1990 and references therein ) . in all cases",
    "the absorption is redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "it is not clear whether this preponderance of redshifted absorption reflects a true infall of gas or if it results from a systematic offset in the systemic velocities towards the blue .",
    "such systematic errors are known to exist due to outflow of emission line gas , which is often used to derive the systemic velocity . in spiral galaxies",
    "the situation is different . here",
    "hi absorption is often seen as a single broad line , extending into both the blue and redshifted sides around the systemic velocity ( cf .",
    "dickey 1986 ) . with higher spatial resolution ,",
    "the broad hi component is decomposed into a narrow one , shifting across the finite extent of the background radio source , over all velocities defined by the rotation of the disk ( koribalski et al .",
    "these absorptions originate in fast rotating circumnuclear disks or rings , of size @xmath7200pc , and with velocities @xmath7200  ( e.g. ngc 253 , 660 , 1808 , 3079 , 4945 , milky way ) .",
    "the same phenomenon could be occuring in the center of cen a , where the presence of a nuclear disk or ring of @xmath7100pc radius and rotating with a velocity of @xmath7220   has been established ( rydbeck et al . 1993 ) .",
    "high rotational velocities at small galactocentric distances are naturally occuring in elliptical galaxies due to the high mass concentration towards the center ( cf .",
    "hernquist 1990 ) and non  circular orbits for the gas can be generated through non - axisymmetric gravitational instabilities ( e.g. bar ) or in the form of tri  axiality of the elliptical galaxy itself .",
    "since the angular extent of the continuum source in cen a is @xmath162mas ( 6000au ) , either blue or redshifted gas , depending on the orientation of the orbits , can be seen in absorption .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of what happens in the center of the milky way .",
    "here the velocities are more strongly non ",
    "circular , maybe because the central bar is oriented at 2030@xmath17 from the sun line of sight ( e.g. blitz & spergel 1991 , weinberg 1992 ) .",
    "absorption in front of the central continuum source sgra reveals a broad component between @xmath18210 to @xmath18110kms , interpreted as coming from the @xmath7200pc nuclear disk , and four narrower features ( at @xmath1851 , @xmath1830 , @xmath182 and @xmath1932 ) corresponding to known spiral arms in the galactic disk ( linke et al .",
    "the broad component at negative velocities is also seen in absorption in front of sgrb2 , in hco@xmath2 as well as h@xmath3co@xmath2 and hcn ( linke et al .",
    "1981 , greaves & nyman 1996 ) .",
    "the size of the millimeter continuum source sgra has recently been determined through vlbi at 3 and 7 mm ( krichbaum et al . 1994 ) , and is 0.33 and 0.75 mas respectively . at those frequencies ,",
    "the interstellar scattering becomes negligible , so these figures are believed to be the actual source sizes ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1994 ) . since these source sizes correspond to @xmath75 au at the galactic center distance , the hco@xmath2 absorption features",
    "prove that the apparent line of sight velocity dispersion can be quite high in a typical edge  on nuclear disk , due to the accumulation on the line of sight of differential non  circular motions .    the emitting molecular gas in cen a is confined to the center region , consisting of the nuclear disk or ring at a radius of @xmath7100pc and an outer ring ( or spiral arm ) at @xmath7750pc .",
    "the absorption complexes are likely to be associated with these features , but since absorption is sensitive to diffuse and low excitation molecular gas which is generally not seen in emission ( e.g. lucas & liszt 1996 ) , it is possible that some intervening molecular gas detected in absorption is associated with the larger hi disk extending to 7kpc ( schiminovich et al 1994 ) . as we have seen in the previous analysis ,",
    "the molecular gas in both lv and hv components is diffuse , with abundance ratios similar to galactic values .",
    "the main difference is that gas in the lv components has a higher kinetic temperature than the hv components .",
    "we can not differentiate between inner and outer molecular gas from this alone .",
    "there are , however , two facts which suggest that the hv components are associated with the nuclear gas and the lv components with the outer disk : ( 1 ) the lv components are close to the systemic velocity and , ( 2 ) whereas the lv components extend between 540556 , the hv components are spread out between 576640 , @xmath74 times larger .",
    "although the rotational velocities are similar for the inner and outer molecular gas ( rydbeck et al .",
    "1993 ) , the inner region has a larger velocity gradient and this gas seen in absorption should be spread over a larger velocity interval .",
    "the blue - shifted ` wing ' , from 500 to 540 , has not been considered above .",
    "this feature is seen at a very low level , and depends on the subtracted emission profile shape , and should be viewed with caution .",
    "could this gas comes from inside the cavity delineated by the circumnuclear ring ? there is a constraint on the radius where molecules can subsist , around a luminous ionizing x  ray source .",
    "maloney et al . ( 1994 ) derived an effective ionization parameter @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22= l@xmath23erg s@xmath24 , @xmath25",
    "n(h@xmath8)/10@xmath26 @xmath11 and @xmath27 is the distance from the x  ray source in parsecs . the gas will not become substantially molecular unless the effective ionization parameter is smaller than 10@xmath28 . from rosat hri measurements , dbereiner et al ( 1996 ) have estimated an x - ray luminosity ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) for the cen a nucleus of l@xmath29 erg s@xmath24 in 1994 , after correcting for absorption . for diffuse gas with n(h@xmath8)@xmath30 , and a column density n(h@xmath8 ) @xmath16 10@xmath31 @xmath32 , the minimum distance from the center is @xmath7100pc . for molecular gas to exist at smaller galactocentric distances in cen a",
    ", both the volume and column densities must be considerably higher .",
    "it is therefore likely that the molecular gas corresponding to the blue  shifted wing is at least at the distance of the circumnuclear ring .",
    "it is possible that this wing corresponds to the 750pc component , which should also possess non ",
    "circular motions .",
    "the orientation of orbits in a tumbling non  axisymmetric component change by 90@xmath17 at each resonance ( e.g. contopoulos & grosbol 1989 ) . along the nucleus line of sight , it is therefore possible that this blue  shift component corresponds to elliptical streamlines perpendicular to that in the circumnuclear ring .",
    "we have obtained new high signal  to  noise molecular absorption spectra towards the centaurus a radio core .",
    "this has allowed the identification of up to 17 components in the hco@xmath2 spectrum .",
    "the components associated with the systemic velocity ( lv ) correspond to intervening material in the accreted gaseous disk of cen a , well outside the circumnuclear ring in non  circular motions . it is not possible at present to derive their exact distances from the center .",
    "the high velocity ( hv ) redshifted components are interpreted in terms of a nuclear ring , at about 100pc distance , with non  circular motions .",
    "the h@xmath3co@xmath2 spectrum indicate that only the central component has relatively moderate opacities , while the hv components have low opacities . from the comparison between the hco@xmath2 , hcn , hnc and cs spectra",
    ", we deduce that the absorbing gas is diffuse and cold on average .",
    "abundances are compatible with galactic values .",
    "comparison with the hco@xmath2 spectrum obtained 7 years ago by eckart et al .",
    "( 1990 ) revealed no time variations at a level @xmath410% .",
    "changes were expected from similar galactic experiments .",
    "we therefore suggest that this constrains the apparent size of the mm continuum source to be larger than 500 au ( or @xmath70.2mas ) , unless the absorbing gas is made up of a very large number of very small ( a few tens of au ) clumps . in the latter case variations tend to average out over time .",
    "the core at 8.4ghz appears as a point source ( @xmath162mas ) in vlbi experiments ( jones et al .",
    "the source size is therefore constrained between 0.2 and 2mas .",
    "the larger size might be only apparent , enlarged through interstellar scattering by the ionised gas in cen a itself .",
