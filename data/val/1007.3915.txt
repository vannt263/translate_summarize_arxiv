    "the question of proton stability is of great importance in elementary particle physics .",
    "conserved baryon number ( b ) could be a reason for a stable proton but would be incompatible with the creation of a baryon asymmetry in the universe . in the standard @xmath0 model of particle physics",
    "@xmath1 is a good symmetry at the renormalisable level ( broken by non - perturbative effects and possibly dimension-6 operators ) and proton decay is sufficiently suppressed .",
    "the phenomenon of b - violation is thus mainly concerned with physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "indeed , a natural framework to address the question is grand unification ( guts ) .",
    "quarks and leptons appear in unified multiplets and @xmath1 is broken .",
    "the known stability of the proton requires the gut scale to be rather large @xmath2 gev such that dimension-6 operators are sufficiently suppressed .    over the years",
    "it appears that the framework of guts seems to require supersymmetry .",
    "this is then consistent with unification of gauge coupling constants at @xmath3 but it leads to new complications with proton stability due to potentially dangerous dimension-4 and dimension-5 operators . new symmetries like r - parity  @xcite ( or matter parity  @xcite ) have been conjectured to forbid the dim-4 operators . such a symmetry would lead to a new stable particle as the source for dark matter .",
    "still , the dim-5 operators are problematic .",
    "other discrete symmetries like baryon triality ( @xmath4 )  @xcite might solve the problem .",
    "the most attractive symmetry is proton hexality ( @xmath5 ) and has been identified by dreiner , luhn and thormeier  @xcite .",
    "it forbids all the problematic dim-4 and -5 operators , but allows lepton number violation in form of majorana neutrino masses : thus @xmath5 perfectly fits our needs .",
    "proton hexality is a beautiful symmetry and grand unification is a very attractive scheme : but unfortunately there is a clash between the two .",
    "@xmath5 is incompatible with a unified structure of quark and lepton multiplets  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to matter parity @xmath6 which can be incorporated e.g. in an @xmath7 gut ( it is a discrete subgroup of @xmath8 in @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is not true for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "an ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of theories with @xmath5 needs something more general than grand unification .",
    "string theory could be a candidate as it also includes a consistent description of gravitational interactions .",
    "recent work towards string theoretic constructions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite has revealed the concept of `` local grand unification ''  @xcite , a variant of guts that addresses some of its problematic properties .",
    "it allows `` split multiplets '' that e.g. solve the doublet - triplet splitting in the higgs - sector and simplifies the breakdown of the grand unified gauge groups .",
    "these incomplete or split multiplets make it possible that @xmath5 can become compatible with local grand unification .    moreover , it has recently been argued that discrete symmetries appear abundantly in string model constructions  @xcite , with important applications for particle physics model building  @xcite .",
    "we are thus in a situation that @xmath5 could originate from a string model as consistent uv completion and that such a symmetry is compatible with local grand unification . within this top - down approach",
    "we can be confident that the global symmetries are respected by gravitational interactions .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of proton hexality within the framework of local grand unification . in section 2",
    "we shall present @xmath5 followed in section 3 by a discussion of the incompatibility of @xmath5 with guts . in section 4",
    "we shall try to incorporate @xmath5 via a bottom - up approach in extra - dimensional gut - like theories and stress the geometric aspects of local grand unification .",
    "section 5 presents the results of heterotic orbifold constructions towards the incorporation of @xmath5 .",
    "we provide some toy models where @xmath5 appears in various different ways , anomalous or non - anomalous .",
    "a completely satisfactory model has not been found yet .",
    "section 6 will discuss possible lines of future research in the direction of explicit model building .",
    "in this section we will motivate proton hexality as a discrete symmetry in the supersymmetric extension of the sm in somewhat more detail . for derivations ,",
    "however , we will refer to original literature .",
    "ensuring sufficient stability of the proton in theories beyond the sm often provides non - trivial restrictions .",
    "new fields can give rise to baryon or lepton number violating couplings . in supersymmetric extensions of the sm , for instance , the most general superpotential respecting renormalisability and gauge invariance is @xmath9 where @xmath10 are family indices and gauge indices are suppressed .",
    "terms in the first line encode yukawa couplings needed for lepton and quark mass generation and the @xmath11-term contribution to the higgs potential .",
    "terms in the second and third line of   violate lepton and baryon number , respectively .",
    "the lepton or baryon number violating couplings ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) can be forbidden by imposing an additional discrete symmetry such as @xmath16-parity or matter parity .",
    "compared to @xmath16-parity , matter parity is a 2 symmetry under which all constituents of a chiral multiplet carry the same charge , _ viz . _",
    "matter multiplets are odd whereas higgs multiplets are even .",
    "assuming that the supersymmetric extension of the sm originates from a more fundamental theory , such as a gut , we also have to discuss effective non - renormalisable couplings .",
    "the superpotential can contain dangerous terms respecting all the symmetries including matter parity , @xmath17 these terms lead to dimension five interactions violating baryon as well as lepton number .",
    "such dimension five couplings are suppressed by just one power of the gut scale and lead to too fast proton decay @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite proposed another discrete 3 symmetry forbidding also the dimension five baryon number violating couplings .",
    "this symmetry was later dubbed baryon triality , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the charges are defined modulo hypercharge ( @xmath18 ) transformation and listed in table [ tab : charges ] .",
    "matter parity as well as baryon triality can be obtained from a spontaneously broken additional 1 gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "anomaly cancellation restricts the spectrum of a gauge theory leading to a finite number of possible discrete symmetries , which can be obtained in such a way .",
    "the authors of @xcite looked through all such symmetries and identified proton hexality , @xmath5 , as the only other phenomenologically interesting discrete symmetry . on sm fields",
    "@xmath5 , as defined by the charge assignments in table  [ tab : charges ] , acts as a 6 symmetry which is the product of baryon triality and matter parity .",
    "proton hexality had been discussed before in @xcite .",
    "it forbids all dangerous dimension four and five baryon or lepton number violating couplings while phenomenologically desirable couplings are allowed .",
    "that is , only terms in the first line of   are allowed at the renormalisable level . at dimension five level ,",
    "only interactions coming from a superpotential @xmath19 ( family indices are suppressed ) are allowed . these respect baryon number and ,",
    "moreover , provide majorana mass terms for left - handed neutrinos after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "dimension six interactions are suppressed by two powers of the gut scale which results in a sufficiently stable proton for supersymmetric theories ( with @xmath3 gev ) .    .hypercharge and discrete charges of the mssm particles under hypercharge @xmath18 , matter parity @xmath6 , baryon triality @xmath4 and proton hexality @xmath5 .",
    "one can show that @xmath20 up to a hypercharge shift .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined just modulo @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",

    "they can be included in a straightforward way ( as shown in table 1 ) .",
    "interactions including right - handed neutrinos do not introduce baryon number violating terms , since their @xmath4 charge is zero .",
    "all terms needed for the see - saw mechanism are allowed by @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "since proton hexality forbids also dangerous dimension five couplings , it is desirable to embed @xmath5 into an underlying more fundamental theory . as a first example we look at grand unification .",
    "the embedding of @xmath5 into a gut has been examined to some extent in  @xcite . there , the authors added an extra anomaly free 1 to the unified gauge group and identified all possible discrete subgroups of that 1 . in this case",
    ", proton hexality does not work with any of the usual candidate unified gauge groups ( pati - salam , 5 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "an option which has been excluded in @xcite is to break the unified gauge group times an extra @xmath26 simultaneously to the sm gauge group times @xmath5 . for unified groups with rank larger than four @xmath5 can ,",
