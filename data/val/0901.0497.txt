    "it is contained within the first gribov region although there is some overlap of the boundaries of the two regions @xcite .    from the definition of the fmr we can write @xmath10=[da^{\\rm fmr}][du]$ ] ( see @xcite for more details ) , and then from ( [ e13 ] ) we have @xmath7=\\int [ da^{\\rm fmr } ] e^{is[a , j]}.\\ ] ] this restriction on the functional integration is difficult to implement in a continuum description due to the highly nontrivial nature of the fmr . instead a restriction to the larger first gribov region is often considered since it can be implemented as a positive definite constraint on @xmath11 .",
    "then the absolute value in ( [ e1 ] ) may be removed and it is also argued that remaining copies are such that the @xmath12 factor can be neglected @xcite .    our approach in this work will be to remain true to ( [ e1 ] ) and allow the functional integral to sample the gribov copies .",
    "a prototype of this type of approach to gribov copies was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "one goal then is to obtain information about @xmath5 directly through explicitly counting copies .",
    "in addition we shall argue that the distribution of copies along a gauge orbit provides information about the spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath5 and @xmath4 that we find have implications for the confinement mechanism .",

    "gribov copies exist in both gauges .",
    "coulomb gauge lacks lorentz invariance and is in fact is not a complete gauge fixing even without gribov copies .",
    "but it provides a more direct connection to the confinement mechanism through the long distance behavior of the instantaneous color coulomb potential , where the latter is governed by the low momentum spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "also , since ghosts are absent in the coulomb gauge , due to the @xmath18 integration is described for example in @xcite .",
    "] we can infer that the ghosts present in the landau gauge will also be absent from the physical states",
    ". this must be the case even though ( [ e1 ] ) lacks a becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) symmetry .",
    "in fact it is presently not known how to maintain a local brst invariance while accounting for gribov copies @xcite .",
    "brst symmetry emerges in the perturbative limit where gribov copies are absent , and then the construction of the physical states can be accomplished explicitly .",
    "but the decoupling of ghosts is more general .",
    "in addition to being gauge invariant , @xmath5 is also scale invariant . for a solution to @xmath19 for example",
    "there is another solution on another gauge orbit where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then the two gauge orbits are related by a scale transformation and the gribov copies on the two orbits are in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "thus gauge inequivalent configurations related by a scale transformation have the same @xmath5 .",
    "an explicit counting of copies is made possible by a restriction to configurations of finite norm in euclidean space , @xmath22 every gauge orbit does have configurations of finite norm and so this constitutes a partial gauge fixing .",
    "the allowed gauge orbits are now characterized by the value of the norm functional and at the stationary points the remaining gauge fixing @xmath23 is satisfied .",

    "the norm along a gauge orbit has reached a global minimum at the point it intersects the fundamental modular region by definition . in other words the gauge fixed hypersurface restricted to finite norm contains within it the fmr .",

    "in particular we would like to determine how @xmath5 depends on the amplitudes @xmath25 and wave vectors @xmath26 of the fourier modes in a finite euclidean volume @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath28 note that once the volume is fixed then we can no longer consider scale transformations , since the spatial extent of a finite norm configuration should also change under a scale transformation . in section 3 we study configurations that are approximations to finite volume plane waves and which allow a counting of gribov copies to be performed . in section 4",
    "we study the distribution of copies along the gauge orbits and discuss the connection to confinement .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the implications of two of the results that follow from the counting of gribov copies , as described in the next section .    * for @xmath29 less than some constant , @xmath30 identically vanishes .",
    "* when @xmath30 is large it grows approximately as a positive power of @xmath29 .",
    "the first result is a consequence of the discrete nature of @xmath30 and it means that there is a region within the space of finite norm configurations for which @xmath30 vanishes .",
    "the gauge fixed hypersurface within this subregion will be a subregion of the fundamental modular region .    given these properties , we would like to illustrate the effect that the @xmath12 factor in the functional integral can have on the gauge - fixed propagator .",
    "for this we shall develop a toy model that shows the effect on the propagator of an otherwise free theory .",
    "for a free theory the generating functional in momentum space can be written as a product of simple one - dimensional integrals , one for each @xmath26 . we replace @xmath25 by @xmath31 and consider the euclidean form of the integrals where a space - like momentum is mapped to a positive @xmath32 . and further we shall temporarily suppose that the @xmath12 factor also factorizes over the momentum modes ; we shall comment more on this below .",
    "we thus consider the toy generating functional based a one - dimensional integral : @xmath33 the toy propagator is @xmath34    the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath35 follows from the properties of @xmath30 noted above and dimensional analysis .",
    "we shall model this dependence as follows : @xmath36 the appearance of a physical mass scale @xmath37 corresponds to an explicit breaking of scale invariance ; it is a physical scale below which gribov copies are important and above which they are not . from ( [ e11 ] )",
    "we see that @xmath37 determines the cross over between the infrared and ultraviolet regimes as follows : for @xmath38 the exponential factor constrains the range of @xmath31 that contributes to the integral , while for @xmath39 it is the @xmath12 factor that constrains the range of @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting that a mass scale @xmath37 enters as soon as the classical structure of the gauge configuration space is put into a quantum mechanical context , due to the @xmath40 dependence of the former versus the @xmath41 dependence of the latter .",
    "it is the classical effects of the gauge field interactions that are responsible for a nontrivial @xmath30 .",
    "the direct quantum effects of interactions are being ignored here , but they also give rise to a mass scale through dimensional transformation .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that these two mass scales are similar .    for this model @xmath42",
    "can be determined analytically , but we do nt give the messy expression here . the leading behavior at @xmath39",
    "is @xmath43 our explicit counting results of the next section show that @xmath44 is certainly greater than 3 and is closer to 5 .",
    "the leading behavior at @xmath38 is @xmath45 we can also consider a smooth analytic continuation to negative @xmath32 , and then we find that @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "we can compare these results to the original analysis of gribov @xcite , which described an attempt to remove the @xmath12 factor by instead restricting the configuration space to the first gribov region .",
    "the implementation of this restriction in his semi - perturbative approach had the effect of introducing into the functional integral another factor instead of @xmath12 .",
    "this factor happens to factorize over the fourier modes and in the notation of our toy model takes the form @xmath48 .",
    "this produces the propagator @xmath49 this propagator vanishes with @xmath32 in the infrared , which is also the case for our model for @xmath50 .",
    "although this infrared suppression of propagation is different from a conventional mass , there are no longer massless excitations in the infrared and in this sense a mass gap has formed .",
    "the vanishing of the propagator implies that it violates of positivity @xcite , and in the context of gluon propagation in qcd this is expected for confinement .",
    "violation of positivity is also found in lattice studies @xcite .",
    "the main difference in the two models is in the ultraviolet behavior , where our propagator approaches the free propagator exponentially quickly according to ( [ e8 ] ) , in contrast to the power law approach in ( [ e9 ] ) . a power law approach to perturbative behavior is common to all versions of the gribov - zwanziger framework @xcite .",
    "an exponential approach to the free propagator has a significant implication .",
    "the operator product expansion for qcd with massless quarks relates the asymptotic behavior of the gluon propagator to various condensates . @xmath51",
    "thus if a gluon propagator has ultraviolet behavior as in ( [ e8 ] ) or ( [ e9 ] ) it is associated with a vanishing or non - vanishing gluon condensate respectively .",
    "the gluon condensate in qcd is in turn related by the trace anomaly to @xmath52 , which by lorentz invariance is the vacuum energy .",
    "our model yields vanishing vacuum energy , and at a superficial level this could be said to reflect the classically scale invariant nature of gribov copies .",
    "we have traced how the quantity @xmath37 that reflects the breaking of scale invariance enters the description of gribov copies .",
    "one might have expected the breakdown of scale invariance to be manifested by a non - vanishing gluon condensate of order @xmath53 .",
    "but we see that this is not the case .",
    "in fact we can relate the absence of a gluon condensate to the discrete nature of @xmath30 ; because @xmath30 is discrete it can and does remain identically zero until @xmath35 is sufficiently large as in ( [ e10 ] ) .",
    "this is the cause of the exponentially small effects of gribov copies as in ( [ e8 ] ) in the regime @xmath38 since the contributions from @xmath54 are exponentially suppressed .",
    "the effects of gribov copies are thus not sufficient to produce a local gluon condensate , which as the operator product expansion demonstrates is a modification of the short distance behavior of the theory .",
    "this reflects the nonlocal and long distance nature of gribov copies .",
    "finally we comment further on the likely false assumption that @xmath12 factorizes in the space of fourier modes , which led to our toy model . for the toy model",
    "the region over which @xmath30 identically vanishes is a hypercube in the space of all @xmath25 . in a more realistic description",
    "the hypercube is probably replaced by some other shape .",
    "but it clear that the reasoning of the previous paragraph depends on the mere existence of a region where @xmath30 identically vanishes , and not on its shape .",
    "note also that in qcd the coupling falls in the ultraviolet , and thus the effect of gribov copies in the ultraviolet is even less than what our toy model indicates .",
    "for our purposes here we shall consider static gauge field configurations , in which case the landau and coulomb gauge conditions become identical .",
    "we restrict further to static spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "as we shall see , these configurations have finite @xmath30 when restricted to finite spatial norm .",
    "we take the gauge group to be @xmath55 with gauge field @xmath56 .",
    "gauge configurations of the form @xmath57 automatically satisfy the gauge condition @xmath58 . by an appropriate choice of @xmath59",
    "we shall be able to approximate plane waves having only spatial oscillations , and thus model the spacelike @xmath32 of the previous section .",
    "the following gauge transformations produce more general spherically symmetric gauge configurations , @xmath60 for the transformed gauge field to be a gribov copy it must satisfy @xmath61 , and this leads to the gribov pendulum equation @xcite : @xmath62 the classical scale invariance corresponds to solutions related by @xmath63 and @xmath64 . here we only study the classical configuration space and thus we treat the coupling @xmath65 as a constant ; also the mass scale @xmath37 will not appear in this section or the next .    from ( [ e2 ] ) , @xmath66 as @xmath67 at least as fast as @xmath68 to have a regular configuration .",
    "to maintain regularity under the gauge transformation , @xmath69 for integer @xmath70 as @xmath67 so that @xmath71 .",
    "for a given @xmath72 the set of solutions of the pendulum equation ( the set of copies ) is parameterized by the `` initial condition '' @xmath73 .",
    "since the equation is invariant under both the constant shift @xmath74 and the reflection @xmath75 , and since the @xmath65 dependence can be absorbed into @xmath59 , without lack of generality we may set @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the infinite number of copies parameterized by @xmath73 reduce down to a finite number , possibly zero , under the further restriction to finite norm configurations .",
    "for the configuration in ( [ e2 ] ) the requirement is @xmath79 for this to be also true of @xmath80 , the gauge transformation must have the property that @xmath69 as @xmath81 for some integer @xmath70 . since @xmath76 this implies that the gauge transformation has a winding number @xmath70 .",
    "the pendulum equation is such that these finite norm solutions only exist for a finite set of @xmath73 . on the other hand the infinite set of infinite norm solutions",
    "are characterized by @xmath82 as @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "since we work in the space of finite norm configurations , by gribov copies we shall henceforth refer only to the finite norm solutions .",
    "because ( [ e4 ] ) can be efficiently integrated as an initial value problem , copies can be counted by simply observing the behavior of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath73 . out to @xmath84 . ] for example for two values @xmath73 , @xmath83 may jump from some value @xmath85 to another value @xmath86 .",
    "we then know by continuity that there are at least @xmath87 copies between these two values of @xmath73 .",
    "the numerical task then is to calculate a set of @xmath83 for a sufficiently fine grained set of @xmath73 , and then obtain a value for @xmath30 by adding the @xmath87 for all the jumps in @xmath83 .",
    "copies can be missed when @xmath83 jumps forward and backward within the @xmath73 stepsize .",
    "as @xmath30 becomes larger the copies are becoming closer together , and thus the stepsize of @xmath73 must be appropriately small to approach the true @xmath30 .",
    "in addition the maximum value of @xmath73 beyond which there are no further copies is increasing for larger @xmath30 .",
    "we shall use these spherical configurations to approximate spatially dependent plane waves .",
    "we thus consider configurations that oscillate as a function of @xmath68 and which are modulated by an amplitude which vanishes in the small and large @xmath68 limits .",
    "when the radius of the amplitude peak is much larger than the wavelength of the oscillation we are approaching plane waves . for the radial profile",

    "our previous results indicate that the density of eigenvalues are skewed towards the infrared by a power law enhancement , implying that the eigenvalue density in ( [ e12 ] ) is enhanced at small @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "we can also expect an infrared enhancement of @xmath178 .",
    "the eigenstates associated with the small eigenvalues are functions that are close to the small gauge transformations @xmath138 , and we find that these latter functions are typically quite rapidly varying with significant overlap with the @xmath59 profile . thus the eigenstates typically contain fourier modes with @xmath179 , and this will enhance @xmath180 relative to @xmath176 .",
    "we obtain a simple model of @xmath178 as follows .",
    "due to the enhanced degeneracy of the eigenvalues of @xmath4 relative to @xmath159 at small @xmath176 , the eigenvectors with eigenvalues of @xmath159 in some range @xmath181 correspond to eigenvalues of @xmath4 in a smaller range @xmath182 , where @xmath183 .",
    "then we have @xmath184 , and thus @xmath185 .",
    "this an infrared enhancement of @xmath160 relative to the free field behavior @xmath175 .",
    "the enhancement of both @xmath186 and @xmath178 by @xmath160 produces a total infrared enhancement factor of @xmath187 in the integrand of the self energy ( [ e6 ] ) , and this is more than sufficient to produce an infrared divergence .",
    "an enhancement factor of @xmath187 implies changing from a coulomb potential ( @xmath188 behavior ) to a confining linear potential ( @xmath189 behavior ) .",
    "in coulomb gauge the gauge fixing on one 3-dimensional time slice is independent of the gauge fixing on another time slice and so results in this gauge apply equally well when the time direction has finite extent , i.e.  at finite temperature .",
    "the infinite coulomb self energy thus persists at high temperature , even above the expected de - confining phase transition , and this is one way to see that the infinite coulomb self - energy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for confinement @xcite . this then leads us to consider what happens for a covariant gauge fixing such as landau gauge .",
    "our counting of gribov copies of static field configurations applies equally to both landau and coulomb gauge conditions .",
    "we also recall that @xmath190 in landau gauge is the ghost propagator in the gauge field background .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath191_{xx}$ ] that we considered in coulomb gauge is the 3-dimensional analog of the 4-dimensional ghost loop contribution to a 2-point function , where each vertex corresponds to the ghost current @xmath192 .",
    "the 2-point function in momentum space is @xmath193 where the color indices are contracted as before .",
    "the infrared pile - up of eigenvalues of @xmath4 that we have seen in coulomb gauge must translate into the infrared enhancement of the ghost propagator in landau gauge . with an implied ensemble average over the gauge field",
    "the ghost propagator should take the form",
    "@xmath194 here we have reintroduced the scale @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath195 is a special value since @xmath196 leads to an infrared divergence in @xmath197 as @xmath198 . in three space dimensions the enhancement corresponding to @xmath195 gave a confining linear potential and was more than sufficient to produce the infrared divergence .",
    "but in four space dimensions we would need @xmath196 to produce an infrared divergence in the coulomb self - energy .",
    "in section 2 we discussed how the rapidly growing numbers of gribov copies can cause gluon propagation to be highly damped in the infrared , such as @xmath199 for @xmath200 . in this case",
    "gluonic effects can be integrated out on scales of order @xmath37 , giving rise to effective nonrenormalizable interactions at this scale .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this disrupts a naive power counting , where it is assumed that momenta much smaller than @xmath37 can dominate all loops in the infrared . due to the suppressed gluon propagator ,",
    "loop momenta of order @xmath37 can dominate some loops .",
    "these effects can induce effective couplings of the ghosts to other colored fields such as @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "as well there are self interactions among the ghosts , such as the interaction @xmath204 with @xmath205 .",
    "( there are also interactions among the color octet versions of the currents . )",
    "this has the consequence that ghost loops , each described by @xmath197 , may be inserted into diagrams , with each insertion contributing an enhancement factor of order @xmath206 for @xmath207 @xcite . due to the ghost coupling to the quark current",
    ", this can give rise to a power - law enhanced ( or log enhanced for @xmath195 ) anti - screening mechanism .",
    "for instance the wilson loop should be dominated by multiple ghost loop contributions .",
    "perhaps this ghost loop anti - screening mechanism could be developed further as a covariant description of confinement .    in conclusion , we have explored the problem of gauge copies present in the continuum definition of non - abelian gauge theories and found that an explicit counting of these copies leads to insights concerning the infrared behavior of these theories . in the last section we found a pile - up of small eigenvalues of the fp operator .",
    "such an enhancement has been widely discussed in the literature , and in the gribov - zwanziger approach it is said to arise due to the constraint on configurations . it is argued that configurations will typically lie close to the gribov boundary where some eigenvalues of small , due simply to the large dimensionality of the configuration space @xcite .",
    "we are instead finding a power - law enhanced density of small eigenvalues by studying the numbers and distributions of copies , in the absence of the constraint on configurations .",
    "small eigenvalues correspond to small curvatures and thus enhanced gauge fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to the gauged fixed hypersurface . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we described the infrared suppression of the `` physical '' gauge modes within the gauged fixed hypersurface due an effective shrinking of the configuration space in these directions .",
    "this is controlled by the rapid growth of @xmath5 .",
    "thus the potentially physical modes are suppressed while unphysical modes , modes that can not appear in physical states , are enhanced .",
    "these two phenomena together present a picture of confinement .",
    "the scale @xmath37 characterizes the mass gap of the theory , the scale below which unphysical modes dominate the dynamics and above which the perturbative modes become evident .    in section 2 we also discussed a vanishing contribution to vacuum energy due to the discreteness in the number of gribov copies .",
    "this result is of interest given the present lack of evidence for vacuum energy in qcd with massless quarks @xcite .",
    "we note that the operator product expansion in ( [ e6 ] ) also shows that a quark condensate does not mimic the effect of a gluon condensate in its effect on the gluon propagator .",
    "this is a consistency check on the possibility that the nonperturbative physics responsible for chiral symmetry breaking also does not contribute to vacuum energy in massless qcd . in this respect",
    "it would be the same as another possible nonperturbative contribution to vacuum energy , that from instantons , which is known to vanish in massless qcd regardless of chiral symmetry breaking ( i.e.  vacuum energy does not depend on the vacuum angle @xmath208 in massless qcd ) @xcite .",
