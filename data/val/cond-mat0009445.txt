    "if the volume element is made very small the fluctuations of interest are thus the fluctuations of the _ local _ electron density .",
    "such fluctuations can be detected , for instance by measuring the current induced into a nearby gate @xcite or a small cavity as shown in fig .",
    "[ ped ] . through the long range coulomb interaction a charge fluctuation above the average equilibrium value of the charge in the conductor generates additional electric fields which lead to a charge reduction at the surface of the gate .",
    "the reduction of charge at the gate surface is accomplished by a flow of carriers out of the contact of the gate @xcite .",
    "the conductor can be in an equilibrium state in which case the charge fluctuations are associated with nyquist noise or it can be in a transport state and the charge fluctuations are those that are generated by shot noise .",
    "charge fluctuations can be detected not only by direct capacitive probing . in an experiment by buks et al .",
    "@xcite charge fluctuations are observed through conductance measurements : the charge fluctuations of two conductors in close proximity can give rise to an additional dephasing rate which a carrier in one conductor experiences due to the presence of the other conductor . in the experiment of buks et al .",

    "the presence of the qpc leads to a reduction of the aharonov - bohm interference oscillations . in the experiment of sprinzak et al .",
    "@xcite a double quantum dot is brought into the proximity of a conductor in a high magnetic field and the broadening of the coulomb blockade peak due the charge fluctuations in the edge states of the nearby conductor are measured .     in the proximity of a quantum point contact with an excess charge @xmath0 .",
    "the dipolar nature of the charge distribution ensures the conservation of currents @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 flowing into this structure .",

    "theoretical discussions of dephasing rates in coupled systems are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . harris and stodolsky @xcite view this as a quantum measurement problem in which the state of one system is measured with the help of another . in this work , as well as in the experimental work of buks",
    "@xcite the time it takes to ascertain the state of the measured system , the measurement time , is identified with the dephasing time .",
    "gurvitz investigates the time - evolution of the density matrix of the system that is measured @xcite .",
    "aleiner et al .",
    "@xcite relate the dephasing rate to the orthogonality catastrophe which occurs if an additional carrier is added to the ground state of the system .",
    "levinson derives a dephasing rate in terms of the charge fluctuation spectrum of non - interacting carriers @xcite .",
    "the approach which we discuss here also relates the dephasing rate to the charge fluctuation spectrum .",
    "however , in contrast to the discussions presented in refs .",
    "@xcite we emphasize an electrically self - consistent approach which takes into account that charging even in open conductors such as qpc can be energetically expensive @xcite .",
    "this approach is applicable to a wide range of geometries and in refs .",
    "@xcite has been used to present a self - consistent treatment of charge fluctuations in edge states .",
    "our discussion can be compared with ref .",
    "@xcite which treats fluctuations as a free electron problem .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in discussions of charge fluctuations in systems that are composed entirely of components in which charge quantization is important , theoretical work @xcite carefully discusses the various capacitance coefficients which determine the charging energies of the system and the coupling . on the other hand , when subsystems like qpc s are discussed , electric carriers are treated as if they were non - interacting entities @xcite .",
    "clearly , a qpc has also a capacitance .",
    "a qpc can be characterized by a capacitance which describes its self - polarization @xcite .",
    "this self - polarization corresponds to charge accumulation on one side of the quantum point contact and charge depletion on the other side of the quantum point contact @xcite .",
    "the self - polarization does not change the overal charge of the qpc and is thus here not of primary importance .",
    "but a quantum point contact can be charged vis - a - vis the gates @xcite or vis - a - vis any other conductor .",
    "this leads to a net charge on the quantum point contact and is the dominant process by which the quantum point contact interacts with an other conductor @xcite .",
    "therefore , like in the systems which exhibit coulomb blockade , we can ask : `` what is the dependence of a charge fluctuation spectrum of a qpc on its capacitance ? '' , or `` how does the additional dephasing rate generated by the proximity of a qpc depend on the capacitance of the quantum point contact ? ''",
    "if the relevant capacitance were a mere geometrical quantity these questions might just determine some prefactors left open in previous work .",
    "however , the charge screening of a qpc is non - trivial since the density of states of a quantum point contact @xcite ( at least in the semi - classical limit ) diverges for a gate voltage at which a new channel is opened ( quantum tunneling limits the density of states ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a simple self - consistent discussion of charge fluctuation spectra of coulomb coupled conductors and to use these spectra to find dephasing rates and self - consistent expression for the measurement time .",
    "we assume that the ground state of the system has been determined and investigate small deviations away from the ground state .",
    "the approach which we present combines the scattering approach with the poisson equation and treats interactions in the random phase approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used with some success to treat the dynamic conductance @xcite of mesoscopic systems , their non - linear i - v - characteristics @xcite , and higher harmonics generation @xcite .",
    "indeed there is a close connection between the charge fluctuation spectra which we obtain and the dynamic conductances of a mesoscopic system @xcite .",
    "we show that the charge noise power of the equilibrium charge fluctuations can at low frequencies be characterized by a charge relaxation resistance @xmath4 . together with the capacitance this resistance determines the @xmath5-time of the mesoscopic structure @xcite .",
    "indeed , independent measurements of the capacitance and the resistance @xmath4 , when compared with the results from a measurement of the dephasing rate would provide an important overall test of the consistency of the theory . in the presence of transport",
    ", we deal in the low temperature limit with shot noise . in this case",
    ", the low frequency charge noise power is proportional to the applied voltage and proportional to a resistance @xmath6 .",
    "some works advocate a perturbative treatment of coupled systems and present results which are proportional to the square of the coupling constant .",
    "in contrast , the self - consistent approach discussed here leads to a more intersting dependence on the bare coupling constant @xcite ( in the physically most relevant case we actually find a dephasing rate which is proportional to one over the square of the coupling strength ) .    in this work ,",
    "we treat only the symmetric qpc coulomb coupled to another system .",
    "this limitation is motivated by the fact that the qpc is the most widely investigated example .",
    "this should permit a most direct comparison of the self - consistent approach advocated here with the results in the literature .",
    "for a review which addresses a wider range of geometries we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to the case where linear screening is applicable .",
    "an evaluation of the dephasing rates requires a discussion of the potential fluctuations ( or equivalently , the charge fluctuations ) .",
    "we will need only the zero - frequency limit of the potential fluctuation spectrum , and it is thus sufficient to find the zero - frequency , white noise limit of the charge fluctuations .",
    "to be definite , consider the conductors of fig .",
    "we first investigate the relation between voltage and charges of these two conductors for small deviations of the applied voltages away from their equilibrium value .",
    "we assume that each electric field line emanating from the cavity ends up either again on the cavity or on the qpc .",
    "there exists a gauss volume which encloses both conductors which can be chosen large enough so that the electrical flux through its surface vanishes @xcite",
    ". consequently , the charge on the two conductors is conserved .",
    "any accumulation of charge at one location within our gauss volume is compensated by a charge depletion at another location within the gauss volume .",
    "the variation of the charge brought about by a small change of the applied voltage is thus of a dipolar nature .    to keep the discussion simple ,",
    "we consider here the case that each conductor is described by a single potential only .",
    "the charge and potential on the cavity are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 and on the qpc by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a more accurate description can be obtained by subdividing the conductor into a number of volume elements @xcite or in fact by using a continuum description @xcite .",
    "the essential elements of our discussion do , however , already become apparent in the simple case that each conductor is described only by one potential and we will treat only this limiting case in this work .",
    "the coulomb interaction is described with the help of a single _ geometrical _ capacitance @xmath11 .",
    "the charges and potentials of the two conductors are then related by @xmath12 @xmath13 the two equations can be thought off as a discretized version of the poisson equation .",
    "note that according to eqs .",
    "( [ q1],[q2 ] ) we have @xmath14 .",
    "we now complement these two equations by writing the charges @xmath15 as a sum of an external ( or bare ) charge calculated for fixed internal potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 and an induced charge generated by the response of the potential due to the injected charges .",
    "the additional charge injected into the cavity ( which we denote by @xmath18 ) due to an increase of the reservoir voltage by @xmath19 is @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the total density of states at the fermi energy of the cavity of the region in which @xmath8 deviates from its equilibrium value .",
    "the induced charge is @xmath22 .",
    "it is negative since the coulomb interaction counteracts charging .",
    "it is also determined by the total density of states since the integrated lindhard function is given by the density of states @xcite .",
    "thus the charge on the cavity is @xmath23 to find the charge on the qpc we must take into account that there are two reservoir potentials which we denote by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "an increase in the potential of contact of reservoir @xmath26 ( at constant internal potential @xmath17 ) does not fill all the available states but only a portion .",
    "the density of states @xcite of carriers incident from reservoir @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath27 and is called the _ injectance _ of contact @xmath26 .",
    "thus the charge injected at constant internal potential by an increase of the voltage @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "similarly an increase of the potential at reservoir @xmath30 leads to an additional charge @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the injectance of reservoir @xmath30 .",
    "together these two ( partial ) density of states are equal to the total density of states of the quantum point contact @xmath33 . thus the total injected charge on conductor",
    "@xmath26 is @xmath34 .",
    "screening is against the total density of states and thus a variation of the internal potential @xmath10 generates an induced charge given by @xmath35 .",
    "the charge @xmath9 is the sum of these three contributions , @xmath36 we arrive thus at the following self - consistent equations relating charges and potentials , @xmath37 @xmath38 we can use these equations to express the internal potentials @xmath39 in terms of the injected charges @xmath40 . we find @xmath41 with an effective interaction @xmath42 given by @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the electrochemical capacitance @xmath45 which is the series capacitance of the geometrical contribution @xmath11 and the density of states of the two conductors @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast to perturbation treatments , the effective coupling element @xmath46 is not proportional to @xmath47 but in general is a complicated function of this energy .",
    "we will use the effective interaction in section @xmath48 to find the measurement time .",

    ", the fluctuating charge can also be written in terms of bare charge fluctuations @xmath52 ( calculated by neglecting the coulomb interaction ) counteracted by a screening charge @xmath53 .",

    "in the zero - frequency limit we find , @xmath64 even though the bare charge fluctuations are uncorrelated , the potential fluctuations and the true charge fluctuations on the two conductors are correlated .",
    "it is useful to characterize the noise power of the charge fluctuations with the help of resistances .",

    "charge fluctuations on the conductors arise due to the random thermal injection of carriers .",

    "thus @xmath4 plays a role in many problems .",

    "for instance a ballistic one - channel quantum wire connecting two reservoirs and capacitively coupled to a gate has for spinless carriers a dc - resistance of @xmath79 and a charge relaxation resistance @xcite of @xmath80 .",
    "the dc - resistance corresponds to the series addition of resistances along the conductance path , whereas an excess charge on the conductor relaxes via all possible conductance channels to the reservoirs and thus corresponds to the addition of resistances in parallel .",

    "its ensemble averaged dc - resistance is @xmath83 , whereas its charge relaxation resistance is @xmath84 .",

    "this gives a measurement time @xmath188 @xmath189 is another quantity that can be measured independently and such a measurement has in fact been carried out by buks et al .",
    "@xcite . it is thus useful to make a theoretical prediction for this quantity .",
    "therefore our purpose here is to evaluate @xmath189 and compare the expression for the measurement time with the phase breaking rate obtained above .",
    "the variation of the conductance of the qpc is determined by the sensitivity of the conductance due to the variation of the potential @xmath10 in the qpc @xmath190 here @xmath191 is the total transmission probability , @xmath192 . in eq .",
    "( [ dg1 ] ) @xmath17 is the potential in the qpc and @xmath10 is the change in potential for the case that an additional electron eners the cavity . in wkb - approximation",
    "we are allowed to replace the derivative with respect to the potential with a derivative with respect to energy , @xmath193 .",
    "for the saddle point qpc we have @xmath194 .",

    "( [ geff ] ) .",
    "thus the addition of an electron onto the cavity changes the conductance by @xcite @xmath198 since @xmath199 we find in the limit @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 as discussed above , as a function of gate voltage the density of states @xmath203 of the qpc exhibits a strong variation . in particular , at zero temperature , the density of states diverges at the threshold of a new quantum channel .",
    "consequently , @xmath189 is also a strong function of gate voltage .",
    "@xmath189 vanishes on the conductance plateaus since @xmath204 vanishes on a plateau .",
    "( [ dg2 ] ) predicts that @xmath189 vanishes also at the channel opening threshold ( @xmath205 ) since the semiclassical density of states diverges .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the identification of the measurement time @xmath183 with @xmath209 is taken for granted by a several authors .",
    "it is now , however , clear that in general @xcite @xmath210 ( for instance for a detector that is not symmetric ) . even for the symmetric detector ( symmetric qpc )",
    "considered here , it is clear that a non - zero temperature has a different effect on the dephasing time and on the measurement time .",
    "the dephasing time @xmath211 is inversely proportional to the charge fluctuation spectrum whereas the measurement time is proportional to the current fluctuation spectrum . at elevated temperatures ,",
    "the measurement must overcome the combined thermal and shot noise and the measurement time will thus increase with increasing temperature . on the other hand the additional nyquist noise leads to a shorter dephasing time .",
    "we have presented an electrically self - consistent discussion of dephasing rates and measurement times for coulomb coupled conductors .",
    "the approach emphasizes that also in open conductors , like qpc s , charge fluctuations are associated with a coulomb energy .",
    "in such a self - consistent treatment , the dephasing rates are typically not simply proportional to a coupling constant . in this work ,",
    "we have attributed only a single potential to each conductor , but the theory @xcite is not in fact limited to such a simplification and permits the treatment of an arbitrary potential landscape @xcite .",
    "the theory also permits a discussion of a wide variety of geometries @xcite .",
    "we have treated the charge fluctuations within a linear screening approach .",
    "large changes in the potential of the qpc would require a discussion of non - linear screening . in either case ,",
    "a theory is necessary which treats the true charge distribution and its fluctuations .",
    "a carrier on the cavity is entangled not only with a single electron on the qpc but with all electrons which are involved in the screening process on the cavity and on the qpc .",
    "instead of a few electron problem our approach emphasizes the true many body nature of charge fluctuations of coulomb coupled conductors .",
    "we have restricted our considerations to the case where we deal with open conductors for which charge quantization plays a minor role .",
    "the considerations given above apply , however , also to the case where we have a qpc interacting with a system in which charge is quantized . even in this case",
    "carriers on the qpc will be screened to a certain extent and the charge relaxation resistance @xmath4 and the resistance @xmath6 should again be part of a self - consistent answer .",
