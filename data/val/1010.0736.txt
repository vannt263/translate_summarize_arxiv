    "numerical sampling of rugged energy landscapes is notoriously difficult @xcite .",
    "transition rates between two states are exponential functions of the energy barrier between them divided by the temperature .",
    "the sampling of complex systems is a daunting task because there are many states of comparable energies separated by large barriers .",
    "one of the most widespread sampling methods at finite temperatures is the monte carlo method , where one follows one or more trajectories of a virtual brownian particle as it moves through the state space . to sample a system at a given temperature , there exists a plethora of approaches , and amongst many others particularly notable are the standard ( metropolis ) @xcite and the kinetic monte carlo @xcite methods . at low temperatures",
    "these stochastic schemes tend to take a long time before a satisfactory result is reached . if one is interested in the behavior of a specific problem in the low - temperature limit , the common method is simulated annealing @xcite . if , however , one samples systems where below a certain temperature the state space splits into regions which are separated by huge barriers , like for example in spin glass systems , simulated annealing does not always lead to satisfactory results .",
    "examples of accepted solutions to this problem include the exchange monte carlo method @xcite and the population annealing @xcite .",
    "although good results are obtainable for most systems using these techniques , relaxation time still stays a crucial factor . for the protein folding problem @xcite for example ,",
    "the longest simulations available on present day computers are still far from the equilibrium distributions .",
    "a possible step in resolving the problem of over - long relaxation times was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where a method to accelerate the sampling of continuous systems was introduced .",
    "the basic idea is to rewrite the fokker - planck equation , which describes the time evolution of the probability distribution for continuous systems , into an imaginary - time schrdinger equation , for which one artificially introduces an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "then the relaxation time , which is proportional to the inverse of the energy gap , is reduced .    in the present paper",

    "our method also leads to improvements for the three - dimensional gaussian ising spin glass .",
    "[ sec : conclusio ] concludes this paper .",
    "in this section we extend idea of ref .",
    "@xcite to discrete systems and discuss its implementation into the kinetic monte carlo algorithm .",
    "we furthermore introduce a simplified version of the kinetic monte carlo scheme to speed up the calculations and save computational resources .      the master equation whose transition rates @xmath0 fulfill the detailed balance condition reads ,",
    "@xmath1 if we set @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the partition function of the system and @xmath5 is the energy of state @xmath6 , we get @xmath7 since @xmath8 , as defined in eq .",

    "this follows directly from the definitions of @xmath9 and @xmath8 and the detailed balance condition in eq .",

    "the spectrum of @xmath8 is then shifted by @xmath13 for all states except the ground state .",
    "it is easy to see that the matrix elements of the projector are @xmath14 , since @xmath15 and the eigenvectors of @xmath8 corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal .",
    "therefore , the imaginary - time schrdinger equation with the modified hamiltonian is @xmath16 the solutions of this equation are , @xmath17 where the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath8 , respectively .    making use of the relation @xmath2 , we can translate eq .",

    "@xcite , a similar idea was tested for continuous systems using a diffusion monte carlo calculation . in the present discrete case",
    ", a straightforward implementation of our method is through the kinetic monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "let us first describe this monte carlo method on the original master equation ( [ eqn : masta ] ) in order to make is clear what parts need modifications to accommodate the @xmath13-term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : qlambda ] ) .",
    "the idea is to try to generate time ` trajectories ' of the system among its various available states in such a way as to satisfy the master equation .",
    "assume the system is in a given state @xmath6 .",
    "the rate ( or probability per unit time ) at which the system will escape from @xmath6 to any available state @xmath23 is given by the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the time at which the system will leave state @xmath6 can thus be drawn from this distribution .",
    "the probability for the system to go from @xmath6 to a state @xmath23 is obviously given by the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "the practical implementation of the algorithm goes as follows .",
    "assume that the system is in state @xmath6 at time @xmath27 :    * the system will make a random transition out of state @xmath6 at a time @xmath28 where @xmath29 is drawn from the distribution @xmath30 . in practice ,",
    "one draws a number @xmath31 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 and takes @xmath32 . * the state @xmath23 to which the system will make the transition",

    "this is to draw all individual probabilities consecutively until eventually they fill up the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "then one draws a uniform random number @xmath34 between 0 and 1 , and the state @xmath23 to which the system jumps is the one indexed by the transition probability which corresponds to @xmath34 on the interval [ 0,1 ] .    by generating many such trajectories ,",
    "one generates probability distributions @xmath35 which stochastically satisfy the master equation .",
    "let us note that all trajectories generated this way are _ statistically independent _ , and can thus be used to compute averages .",
    "we now turn to an implementation of the kinetic monte carlo when one introduces the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "let us first expand unity as @xmath36 where the sum is over the states @xmath37 accessible from a given state @xmath6 .",
    "if all states are accessible in principle , which is the case if the system has no intrinsic dynamics , like the ising model , then we restrict @xmath37 to some subset depending on @xmath6 , for example the nearest neighbors .",
    "next , insert eq .",
    "( [ eqn : unity ] ) into the outgoing part of the master equation , to obtain @xmath38 note that , even if the physical considerations do not allow non - local moves , we can define transition probabilities @xmath39 for such moves and thus incorporate non - local states into the list @xmath37 in a very straightforward manner .    the introduction of the term @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : unity ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : out ] ) makes the present implementation unsuitable to reproduce finite - temperature properties . to show this fact ,",
    "let us first recall that a frequently - used transition probability is the heat bath ( or glauber ) method @xmath41 which trivially fulfills the detailed balance condition .",
    "however , the modified master equation is not symmetric in its outgoing and incoming parts .",
    "the kinetic monte carlo algorithm uses only the outgoing part for sampling , and therefore , adding the @xmath13 terms tilts the detailed balance in favor of the energetically lower lying states . to see this",

    "if we recall that @xmath44 , which represents the sum of boltzmann factors of the subset @xmath45 of states accessible from state @xmath46 , then we can conclude that if , @xmath47 , there are more energetically lower lying states available from @xmath6 than from @xmath48 .",
    "this would suggest that in this implementation ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : out ] ) ) the addition of @xmath13 indeed tilts the detailed balance in favor of states from where more lower lying states are accessible .",
    "this changes the finite temperature values of physical observables when compared to calculations made with @xmath49 at the same temperature .",
    "nevertheless , when we are interested in the ground state solution , we do not have to worry about such finite temperature differences .",
    "there may be other implementations that do not use state- or temperature - dependent renormalizations of @xmath13 and thus allow us to keep detailed balance .",

    "we see that for @xmath58 and very small @xmath59 ( red line ) there is a slight visible deviation to shorter tours from the simulation with @xmath49 ( black line ) , while a larger value of @xmath60 ( green squares ) affects the sampling in a negative way . as an extreme case",
    "we take only @xmath61 non - local states and @xmath60 ( blue circles ) , and see that the system does not relax .",
    "the reason for this failure at @xmath60 , @xmath61 is that , with adding @xmath13 to the transition rates , jumps are facilitated .",
    "since we are looking at only two possible jumps , at some point both transitions will become approximately equally likely and the system fails to relax .",
    "we see that , if too few states to which jumps are possible are chosen , the sampling is influenced in an undesirable way .",
    "we use this simplified version of the kinetic monte carlo algorithm also for the ising model , since for larger system sizes calculating the hamiltonian and exponentiating it @xmath62 times ( there are @xmath62 nearest neighbors to a given state ) becomes quickly very time - consuming . as a rule of thumb , we sample @xmath63 , instead of @xmath62 , local states per monte carlo step .",

    "<S> we propose a method to reduce the relaxation time towards equilibrium in stochastic sampling of complex energy landscapes in statistical systems with discrete degrees of freedom by generalizing the platform previously developed for continuous systems . </S>",
    "<S> the method starts from a master equation , in contrast to the fokker - planck equation for the continuous case . </S>",
    "<S> the master equation is transformed into an imaginary - time schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the schrdinger equation is modified by adding a projector to its known ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this transformation decreases the relaxation time and propose a way to use it to accelerate simulated annealing for optimization problems . </S>",
    "<S> we implement our method in a simplified kinetic monte carlo scheme and show an acceleration by an order of magnitude in simulated annealing of the symmetric traveling salesman problem . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons of simulated annealing are made with the exchange monte carlo algorithm for the three - dimensional ising spin glass . </S>",
    "<S> our implementation can be seen as a step toward accelerating the stochastic sampling of generic systems with complex landscapes and long equilibration times . </S>"
