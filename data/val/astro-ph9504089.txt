    "an important aim of cosmology is to determine a relationship between the cosmic density contrast @xmath0 and the peculiar - velocity field @xmath1 under the assumption that these fields have evolved under the action of gravity . in the eulerian theory of gravitational instability , retaining only the linear growing - mode solution , this relationship is simply given by and @xmath2 denote ( comoving ) eulerian and lagrangian coordinates respectively . ]",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the usual linear growth factor , such that @xmath5 in an einstein - de sitter universe . beyond linear theory , in the weakly non - linear regime , ( [ linear ] ) has been used to good effect as an estimate of the density contrast field from observed peculiar - velocities ( e.g. bertschinger & dekel 1989 ; dekel et al .",
    "1990 ; bertschinger et al .",
    "on the other hand , the potent method and other quasi - linear reconstruction procedures involve the zeldovich approximation ( za)(nusser et al .",
    "1991 ; nusser & dekel 1992 ) .",
    "the za does not however , strictly speaking , provide an exact algebraic relation between the fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it can however yield ( as shown in nusser 1991 ) a relation between the fields that is self - consistent within the order of the approximation , i.e. within @xmath8 . in the za , from the lagrangian integral of the continuity equation",
    "we have    @xmath9^{-1}\\;,\\label{zeldovich}\\ ] ]    and the fields are mapped back to eulerian space via the za map for the orbits of the particles .",
    "initial conditions are specified at an arbitrary early time @xmath10 . also , it is customary to make the assumption of smoothness at early times , @xmath11 , by virtue of the amplitude of the fluctuations in the microwave background . from ( [ zarecons ] )",
    "we obtain the linear relation ( [ linear ] ) by truncating the expansion of the determinant ( [ zeldovich ] ) to the lowest order in the perturbation field @xmath1 and replacing lagrangian by eulerian coordinates ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these schemes have been generalized further ( gramann 1993a , 1993b ; for their eulerian analogue , see bernardeau 1992 ) by starting out with a parametrization of the particle orbits @xmath13 of the type :    @xmath14    in the case of a flat universe , the leading second - order term in perturbation theory ( bouchet et al .",
    "1992 ) is indeed @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the coordinate map ( [ moutarde ] ) is in principle well - motivated ( for a numerical comparison of the different models , see e.g. dekel 1994 ) .",
    "however , as shown in gramann ( 1993b ) , orbits of the type ( [ moutarde ] ) do not yield a self - consistent relation for the cosmic density and velocity fields ; the density fields obtained via ( a ) the continuity equation and ( b ) the euler equation differ within the order of the approximation .",
    "the reason for this is that , as we shall see , ( [ moutarde ] ) is only an approximate second - order solution of the lagrange - newton system .",
    "thus , we wish to call the attention of the reader to the fact that the reconstruction models derived from ( [ moutarde ] ) and , more generally , from an ansatz including higher orders in @xmath4 ,    @xmath16    ( for arbitrary n ) , do not follow a rigorous line of analysis ( in the case of an arbitrary @xmath17 ) for the following reasons :    in these models , the parametrization of the orbits is given ad hoc and it is not derived as a solution of the lagrangian evolution equations for the flow field . in particular , the absence of lower - order growing modes , that are present in the general perturbation theory solution , implies that the derivation of @xmath0 through the continuity equation neglects couplings of these modes with leading - order terms .",
    "the density contrast @xmath18 obtained from the continuity equation in perturbation theory and @xmath19 satisfying euler s equation are mutually incompatible .",
    "there is no reason to justify that @xmath4 is a good perturbative parameter ( in terms of the convergence of the solutions ) and that a meaningful generalization of the family of solutions where the za belongs can be realized as a polynomial in @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that ( ii ) follows as a consequence of ( i ) .",
    "regarding ( i ) and ( iii ) , it has been shown that the correct coordinate map between eulerian and lagrangian coordinates in lagrangian perturbation theory is obtained by calculating the perturbative solution of the lagrange - newton system for the trajectories @xmath13 .",
    "these evolution equations are obtained by transforming the euler - newton system to lagrangian coordinates and eliminating all eulerian fields by using exact lagrangian integrals for the eulerian acceleration and density ( buchert & gtz 1987 ; buchert 1989 ) . within this scheme ,",
    "the za is recovered as a subclass of solutions ( buchert 1992 ) , and hence , one can obtain a self - consistent solution for the over - density field in terms of the velocities as in nusser ( 1991 ) .",
    "furthermore , the second- and third - order solutions obtained in the lagrangian framework ( buchert & ehlers 1993 , buchert 1994 ; and in a slightly different approach bouchet et al .",
    "1992 , 1995 ; catelan 1995 ) are unique and well - defined at all times from a fiducial time @xmath20 , where initial data are specified , , an arbitrary but sufficiently early epoch , not necessarily @xmath21 . ] until shell - crossing , provided we impose periodic boundary conditions and fix some global gauge conditions ( ehlers & buchert 1997 ) as opposed to the orbits described by polynomials in @xmath4 , which are expected to have poor convergence ( for a discussion in the context of the variational approach to the solutions see susperregi & binney 1994 ) .",
    "although the leading terms of the longitudinal parts of the perturbation solutions seem to confirm this polynomial approach ( e.g. bouchet et al .",
    "1992 , for the second - order solutions ) , this is not a mathematically consistent motivation for using @xmath4 as an expansion parameter by going to higher orders in perturbation theory . on the contrary ,",
    "the structure of the lagrangian perturbation scheme is such that , starting at third order , the presence of interaction terms among perturbations of different orders are an obstacle to convergence , and in fact for @xmath22 all terms are interaction terms ( see buchert 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath23 an ansatz of the form ( [ d ] ) can not reproduce gravitational dynamics , as stated in ( iii ) .",
    "this is an especially critical point to bear in mind in the context of reconstruction models in which higher - order couplings of flow field gradients show up in the density - velocity relation .    in this paper",
    ", we approach the reconstruction problem from a purely lagrangian perspective using the solutions of the lagrange - newton system obtained by buchert & ehlers ( 1993 ) . the goal of the paper is to obtain a self - consistent solution for the over - density field that is valid to second order , thus extending the results of nusser 1991 in the context of the za .",
    "our results are purely lagrangian , but in obtaining them we rely on the fact that there is a one - to - one mapping between lagrangian and eulerian coordinates and hence , the reconstruction formulae presented are only valid up to orbit - crossing time . the basic formalism is laid out in sect . 2 , and in sect .",
    "3 we discuss its application to two different classes of initial conditions . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the self - consistency of solutions in perturbation theory models . sect .",
    "5 compares the model presented with previous reconstruction procedures and sect .",
    "6 sums up .",
    "in what follows , we shall mainly discuss the physically interesting case where the peculiar - velocity field is parallel to the peculiar - acceleration , up to decaying modes , a property which results from the eulerian linear theory for irrotational fields , and is also valid for the general irrotational lagrangian linear solution ( the growing - mode solution supports the tendency to becoming parallel , see buchert ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "we will further recall that both fields are practically parallel up to orbit - crossing time , also in the second - order schemes we will consider .",
    "the results presented however are not restricted to solutions where this property holds but , as we will see below , apply to a wider class of solutions .    in",
    "what follows we shall study subclasses of the second - order lagrangian perturbation solutions given by buchert & ehlers ( 1993 ) which are only restricted by the requirement that there exists an arbitrary functional relationship among peculiar - velocity and -acceleration at the initial time .",
    "the subclasses are singled out by special assumptions for this functional relationship .",
    "the second - order parametrization of the orbits of the particles in terms of their lagrangian coordinates and time for the subclasses of solutions which we consider later can be written as follows :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dimensionless functions of time , calculated from solving the lagrange - newton system for deviations from the homogeneous solution to second order .",
    "moutarde et al .",
    "( 1991 ) investigated the orbits ( [ eulerian ] ) ( rather than ( [ d ] ) ) , for leading orders of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and for a model of a particular initial potential . in the next section",
    ", we will examine two particular solutions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for different , but generic , initial conditions .",
    "the expansion factor @xmath27 is normalized to unity at @xmath20 , @xmath28 , ( and equal to the linear growth factor @xmath4 in an einstein - de sitter universe considered here ) .",
    "the perturbation potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined by the initial data such that , in general , they have to satisfy the ( non - local ) boundary conditions :    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 denotes the initial peculiar - velocity potential    @xmath34 @xmath35 , and ( following the summation convention )    @xmath36    @xmath37    are the first and second principal invariants of the peculiar - velocity tensor gradient . for periodic boundary conditions and suitable gauge conditions ,",
    "however , which we shall assume hereafter , we can simplify ( [ s1])([s2 ] ) ( see ehlers & buchert ( 1997 ) for a rigourous proof ) :    @xmath38    @xmath39    therefore , ( [ eulerian ] ) gives us the trajectory of any given particle by solving ( [ pbc1])([pbc2 ] ) for an initial potential @xmath33 .",
    "at the time @xmath20 , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 vanish , so lagrangian and eulerian coordinates coincide ,    @xmath42    thus , the expression for the density contrast at any given time and for any trajectory field reads :    @xmath43= [ \\,1+\\delta(t_0,\\b x)\\,]\\;j^{-1}\\ ; , \\label{density1}\\ ] ]    where the determinant @xmath44 is    @xmath45    in order to calculate @xmath0 as a function of eulerian coordinates , we need to invert the coordinate map ( [ eulerian ] ) so that lagrangian coordinates are expressed in terms of the eulerian coordinates and thereby derive the following :    @xmath46=[\\,1+\\ueber{\\delta}{o}\\,]\\;j^e , \\label{density2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the initial density contrast and the determinant @xmath48 is    @xmath49    eq .",
    "( [ density2 ] ) gives the eulerian values of the field @xmath0 at the eulerian positions corresponding to a given trajectory labelled by @xmath50 . in principle",
    ", we can interpret this as a field @xmath7 satisfying the eulerian equations of motion .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to bear in mind that the functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath51 is only well - defined while the map between both coordinate spaces remains one - to - one .",
    "the peculiar - velocity is given by    @xmath52    and , similarly , the peculiar - acceleration ,    @xmath53    the jacobian @xmath54 of the transformation @xmath51 is given explicitly in appendix b. this general expression involves a number of cross - terms of @xmath1 and @xmath55 components .",
    "however , we can ignore these by assuming the peculiar - velocity field to be parallel to the peculiar - acceleration , such that    @xmath56    this assumption can be justified on physical grounds : after some time , the peculiar - velocity field tends to be parallel to the peculiar - acceleration , for the second - order irrotational solution ( [ eulerian ] ) , due to the existence of decaying and growing solutions in the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "we will address this issue in detail in sect . 5 , and",
    "show that a weaker condition on the gradients of the fields leads to the same result .",
    "as in the first - order model ( where ( [ parallelism ] ) holds exactly ) the growing part supports parallelism , as it is shown in buchert & ehlers ( 1993 ) for a wide class of irrotational second - order solutions .",
    "indeed , the difference between @xmath57 and @xmath55 for ( [ eulerian ] ) is given by decaying modes only , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "therefore , we are entitled to express @xmath55 by some function proportional to @xmath1 , so that the inversion of the map ( [ eulerian ] ) satisfies the implicit equation :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is given explicitly in appendix a for two different models .    in the first - order model , by virtue of ( [ parallelism ] ) , the same relation ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) holds with the appropriate @xmath59 ( appendix a.1 ) . with condition ( [ parallelism ] )",
    "implicit in ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) , the determinant @xmath60 reduces to :    @xmath61    here , @xmath62 ( divergence ) , @xmath63 ( dispersion of diagonal components ) and @xmath64 ( determinant ) denote the three principal scalar invariants of the peculiar - velocity gradient with respect to comoving eulerian coordinates as given in appendix b. therefore , substituting ( [ jacobian ] ) into ( [ density2 ] ) , we derive the relation for the density and velocity fields : @xmath65 @xmath66    where @xmath67 .",
    "this result is unique and valid up to orbit - crossing time , i.e. , while the coordinate inversion @xmath68 is well - defined . in principle , it enables us to calculate the cosmic density field from observations of the peculiar - velocity field in the weakly non - linear regime at a fixed time , provided we set @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to emphasize that , due to the parallelism condition ( [ parallelism ] ) , ( [ result ] ) applies at both first- and second - order ( the appropriate @xmath59 for each case is given in appendix a ) .",
    "the simplicity of ( [ result ] ) is remarkable .",
    "it shows that the first- and second - order models contain not only quadratic terms in @xmath70 ( as pointed out in the literature , e.g. gramann 1993a , b ) but also cubic terms , arranged in the form of the principal invariants of the deformation tensor : @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "a more general result , albeit a complicated one , can also be derived for the case where we drop the condition ( [ parallelism ] ) .",
    "the corresponding solution , taking into account all cross - terms , is obtained using the full solution for @xmath54 given in appendix b. nonetheless , considering @xmath55 is not directly measurable from observations , the application of the general solution without the assumption of parallelism would be impractical . in these circumstances ( [ result ] )",
    "provides a useful approximation .",
    "in this section , we will examine two particular solutions of the second - order orbits ( [ eulerian ] ) that are of interest in the reconstruction procedure described in sect .",
    "these are characterized by the nature of the initial conditions at @xmath20 . at this time , only one field , s , is specified .",
    "these solutions are derived in buchert & ehlers ( 1993 ) .",
    "model i : @xmath74 _    in this case , the velocity and acceleration fields are set to be identically parallel at the initial time . this relation is satisfied in zeldovich s ansatz , and it is a natural condition to set in a more general scheme , given the remarkable accuracy of the `` zeldovich approximation '' .",
    "the initial density perturbation is thus expected to be proportional to the divergence of the peculiar - velocity .",
    "the solution ( [ eulerian ] ) then is specified by the functions    @xmath75,\\ ] ]    @xmath76.\\ ] ]    therefore , the peculiar - velocity reads @xmath77 @xmath78    and the peculiar - acceleration , @xmath79 @xmath80    thus the departure from the parallelism condition ( [ parallelism ] ) is    @xmath81    hence , this difference is a negligible effect due to the presence of the decaying mode . at @xmath82 ,",
    "the rhs of ( [ diff - i ] ) is identically zero and , at later times , the decaying mode vanishes sufficiently fast and the overall coefficient therefore tends to a constant .",
    "this constant second - order term could be absorbed in a coordinate transformation . in this case , @xmath59 in the reconstruction formula ( [ result ] ) is given by ( see appendix a.2 for details )    @xmath83    this is a monotonic function of @xmath84 , and to the leading order it reads    @xmath85    which is consistent with the results presented in moutarde et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "model ii : @xmath86 _    although model i provides an appropriate initial value setting from the physical point of view , the initial density contrast in this model is strictly non - vanishing .",
    "however , for reconstruction models we have to neglect this , since we do not want to specify initial information . precisely speaking , this implies an error which can be removed by using model ii : given a vanishing initial peculiar - acceleration field , the initial density contrast @xmath87 is zero and its growth is induced by the initial velocity perturbations only . in this case ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 in the class of solutions for the orbits ( [ eulerian ] ) are given by    @xmath88,\\ ] ]    @xmath89 @xmath90.\\ ] ]    therefore , from ( [ u ] ) the peculiar - velocity is    @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93    and the peculiar - acceleration ,    @xmath94 @xmath95    like in the previous example we can calculate the departure from parallelism which is given in terms of the decaying modes @xmath96 @xmath97    such that , it is once more manifest that at late times parallelism is supported by the growing modes . at first sight",
    "it might seem that the presence of the first - order potential in ( [ diff - ii ] ) is a shortcoming for model ii in comparison to model i , where departure from parallelism is a second - order effect , given by ( [ diff - i ] ) .",
    "however , although the initial fields are non - parallel as indicated by ( [ diff - ii ] ) , the orders of magnitude involved in the rhs are very small from the outset and these decaying modes soon decrease further to negligible values .",
    "parallelism of @xmath98 and @xmath99 _    the assumption of parallelism ( [ parallelism ] ) is justified by the presence of decaying modes in the difference @xmath100 in both models i and ii . on the other hand",
    ", it is apparent that the exact expression for @xmath54 requires knowledge of the derivatives of the peculiar - acceleration field . using the parallelism condition to simplify",
    "the solution implies neglecting the contribution of the eulerian derivatives of the vector field @xmath101 . in this section",
    "we produce an analytical argument to justify this approximation in the weakly nonlinear regime .    a measure of parallelism of @xmath98 and @xmath99 is given by the quantity @xmath102 (",
    "an alternative measure has been proposed recently by bagla & padmanabhan ( 1996 ) ) .",
    "we expect this quantity to be small in the regime where @xmath1 and @xmath55 are close to being parallel .",
    "as is given explicitly in appendix a , we have    @xmath103    @xmath104    and therefore ,    @xmath105    for the particular case of model i , for instance , this leads to    @xmath106    this quantity vanishes for all models where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are parallel .",
    "however this is not so in general , and the integrals of ( [ s1])([s2 ] ) can yield to non - parallel ( and non - negligible ) gradients @xmath107 and @xmath108 . furthermore",
    ", the presence of the coefficient @xmath109 in ( [ wedge ] ) indicates that an initial departure from parallelism of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath55 will grow in time . at this point",
    "it is important to stress that our simplification to derive ( [ result ] ) does not strictly speaking rely on the parallelism of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath55 but on that of the spatial gradients @xmath70 and @xmath110 .",
    "the differences of these fields are intimately connected , but the time dependence involved is different as is clear by direct differentiation .",
    "parallelism of the gradients is a weaker condition to impose than that of the fields themselves .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath111\\ ] ] @xmath112^{-1},\\ ] ]    and @xmath113\\ ] ] @xmath112^{-1},\\ ] ]    therefore , we have that for model i :    @xmath114    and for model ii : @xmath115 @xmath116    where    @xmath117^{-1}.\\ ] ]    in the case of model i , parallelism is exact in the initial conditions , therefore there is no dependence of the derivatives on the potential @xmath29 . in all other models ,",
    "the difference @xmath118 comes as a linear combination of the double derivatives @xmath119 , @xmath120 , up to the coefficient @xmath121 that plays a role when we approach orbit - crossing . for realistic fields , i.e. , those that evolve from negligible amplitudes at @xmath82 , the gradients of the perturbative potentials @xmath29 , @xmath30 are sufficiently smooth and slowly varying , and therefore they are well under the order of the approximation in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "we stress , however , as indicated above that in the strongly nonlinear regime ( or at the epoch of shell - crossing , respectively ) , this argument breaks down in the same manner as perturbative solutions at any order do .",
    "in our reconstruction procedure we have proposed a simplification of the exact solution ( [ density2 ] ) under the assumption of parallelism of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus we are able to obtain an expression for the density in terms of the derivatives of the velocity only .",
    "we have seen that this assumption is sufficiently accurate , the difference between both fields is a negligible effect .",
    "however , it is not necessary to adopt parallelism , and in this section we will outline a possible scheme to construct iteratively a `` self - consistent '' solution for @xmath55 from the velocity field , so that the reconstruction method with the jacobian ( [ full - jacobian ] ) can be employed .    at this point",
    ", we would like to call the attention of the reader to the problem of self - consistency of approximations as pointed out by doroshkevich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) ( compare the discussion by buchert ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "we enunciate the problem by stating that perturbative solutions of the equations of motion are mutually consistent only within the truncation order .",
    "this can be illustrated with the `` zeldovich approximation '' .",
    "the density contrast as given by the poisson equation is    @xmath122    and the density contrast as given by mass conservation    @xmath123    introducing the dimensionless error    @xmath124",
    "this difference for the `` zeldovich approximation '' gives    @xmath125    which is within the order of the approximation . in the second - order model",
    "we expect an analogous situation .",
    "as the orbits we have used are obtained by solving the lagrange - newton system perturbatively , eulerian quantities constructed from these will automatically satisfy all equations to second - order .",
    "however , the density contrast constructed from the velocities through ( [ result ] ) is associated to a newtonian potential causing an acceleration that will in general differ from the acceleration given by the second - order orbits .",
    "this difference vanishes only for exact solutions .",
    "let us denote by a ( 1 ) superscript the quantities derived from the particle orbits .",
    "hence , @xmath126 @xmath127    and therefore , @xmath128",
    "@xmath129    which in general differs from @xmath130 . from @xmath131 it is possible in principle to solve for @xmath132 , from which @xmath133 is similarly constructed , and we iterate henceforth via the prescription    @xmath134 @xmath135    that we use to integrate @xmath136 .",
    "a consistent solution is then found in the limit    @xmath137    note that after each iteration , the condition @xmath138 ( arising from the lagrange equations in the exact case ) is preserved at all times . finding a self - consistent solution to the dynamics by successive iterations is tantamount to minimization of the difference of the particle orbits    @xmath139    that we estimate at each iteration through the differential equation    @xmath140    this is however a non - trivial numerical problem that is beyond the scope of this article and we plan to pursue this possibility in a future work .",
    "we have calculated a unique and well - defined relation ( [ result ] ) for cosmic density and velocity fields that is a self - consistent solution in the second - order model .",
    "given the second - order ansatz for the particle orbits ( [ eulerian ] ) , the lagrange - newton system determines the functions of time @xmath25 and @xmath26 for generic initial conditions and it constrains the perturbation potentials @xmath29 , @xmath30 in terms of the peculiar - velocity potential @xmath33 at @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , the orbits are determined at all times until shell - crossing , and the density is obtained from the continuity equation by evaluating the jacobian @xmath60 of the transformation @xmath141 .    for simplicity , we have discussed the formulae on the assumption that the velocity and acceleration fields are parallel . in sect .",
    "3 , it is shown that this assumption is a sufficient condition but by no means necessary , and in general it is sufficient to adopt the condition of parallelism of the gradients of the fields , which is a weaker requirement .",
    "the self - consistency of the solution for the density field follows from the fact that the orbits employed are second - order solutions in perturbation theory and not any given ansatz .",
    "our result ( [ result ] ) generalizes previous results in the literature in the following respect .",
    "nusser ( 1991 ) obtained two relations for the density constrast in the za ,    @xmath142    and    @xmath143    where a scaled peculiar velocity is used ,    @xmath144    and @xmath18 is derived from the continuity equation and @xmath19 from euler s equation .",
    "the difference between ( [ nusseri ] ) and ( [ nusserii ] ) is second order and is therefore within the order of the approximation :    @xmath145    thus , in the za , only the first term on the rhs of ( [ nusseri ] ) is significant and consistent with conservation of momentum . in the second - order result ( [ result ] ) , we are able to retain two more terms and this relation has a similar form as ( [ nusseri ] ) , where @xmath146 is replaced by @xmath147 .",
    "this form of the over - density field satisfies automatically euler s equation to second - order , since the orbits are obtained solving the lagrange - newton system to this order , and therefore the @xmath148 and @xmath149 terms are a legitimate part of the solution and not higher - order ` error ' terms as in ( [ nusseri ] ) .",
    "one does not obtain self - consistent solutions in models where an arbitrary perturbative parameter , such as @xmath4 , is singled out , which results in a hybrid eulerian - lagrangian scheme .",
    "the chief problem inherent to such approaches is that the time dependence is set ab initio on the orbits and it is not determined by the equations of motion as is done in the solutions we have used .",
    "this type of ansatz can be employed to good effect in a least - square fit for the dynamics of the particles as a two - boundary condition problem ( see for example susperregi & binney 1994 ) , but in perturbation theory they are inconsistent and of little predictive power due to their lack of convergence as discussed in the introduction . in such approaches , both the continuity equation and the equation of motion must be truncated to the given perturbation order and , consequently , the corresponding solutions @xmath18 and @xmath19 in general differ . therefore , from the analysis of the previous section , we can also conclude that @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not only differ by a higher order in the approximation , but failure to solve for the orbits perturbatively is conducive to discrepancies in the solutions _ at the same order_. given a parametrization of the orbits such as ( [ moutarde ] ) , the second - order solution for the continuity density is given by ( gramann 1993b )    @xmath150    as shown by gramann ( 1993b ) the second order term for @xmath19 differs by a factor of @xmath151 from that of ( [ gramann ] ) .",
    "this inconsistency at second order arises as a consequence of using second - order orbits that do not correspond to the actual second - order perturbation theory solutions .",
    "in contrast to the solution ( [ result ] ) , ( [ gramann ] ) only accounts for quadratic couplings in @xmath152 . considering that at first order we already have the relation ( [ result ] ) , it is apparent that ( [ gramann ] ) is not an accurate generalization of the lagrangian linear theory .",
    "in the scheme discussed here , initial conditions are set at @xmath82 , and hence we can try to establish a connection with the reconstruction model ( [ gramann ] ) by specifying these at @xmath21 . however , the normalization chosen for @xmath27 impedes to set @xmath20 identically equal to zero .",
    "a choice of an arbitrarily small @xmath20 requires keeping only the growing solutions in the expression for @xmath59 , entirely neglecting the presence of decaying modes .",
    "we have to further restrict ourselves to the leading term ( which is a particular solution of the second - order differential equation ) and neglect the homogeneous second - order solution ( which is growing ) . the leading order in @xmath59",
    "is , at both first and second order ( for model i ) ,    @xmath153    and thus , using definition ( [ velocity ] ) in ( [ result ] ) , we get    @xmath154 @xmath155    with the normalization chosen for @xmath27 , ( [ growing - modes ] ) is in reasonable agreement with ( [ gramann ] ) at early times . at late times",
    "however , the presence of the @xmath156 term in ( [ growing - modes ] ) diminishes the departures from linearity brought about by the quadratic term whereas this effect is not accounted for in ( [ gramann ] ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that ( [ result ] ) is strictly only valid so long as the inversion @xmath157 is well - defined .",
    "indeed , the expression given for @xmath158 provides the eulerian values of the density contrast and is given as a function of eulerian positions up to orbit - crossing time .",
    "at later times the inversion map becomes singular and this result does not hold .    by integrating the poisson equation in eulerian coordinates using @xmath159",
    "it is concluded ( e.g. gramann 1993a , eq .",
    "( 2.20 ) ) that the presence of the quadratic term @xmath160 in the density - velocity relation induces a departure from parallelism between peculiar - velocity and -acceleration vectors .",
    "the derivation of this relation under the assumption of parallelism proves this conclusion is not correct .",
    "certainly , one would be able to obtain agreement with solutions of poisson s equation if a self - consistent density contrast were known .",
    "it is manifest however that this is far from being the case in these models .",
    "differences in the solutions within the order of the approximation , as it is the case with @xmath18 and @xmath19 in gramann s analysis , imply that any conclusion drawn from poisson s equation applied to the reconstructed density is not justified as long as approximations are involved .",
    "we finally note that an expansion of the jacobian to a given order ( _ after _ the solutions are obtained ) mirrors formally the mathematical fact that , in principle , we can not believe terms of higher order than the perturbative order of the trajectories .",
    "however , the powerful properties of a lagrangian approach mainly rely on the existence of an exact integral for the density for _ any _ given trajectory field , which allows using these approximations until shell - crossing . at this epoch",
    "the contributions from second and third invariants is of the same order as that from the first invariant , a fact which underlies the success of the za .",
    "whether this extrapolation until shell - crossing is justified at all is another issue .",
    "the successes of lagrangian perturbation methods as summarized by bouchet et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the success of following trajectories until shell - crossing and even beyond ( melott et al .",
    "1995 ) strongly argue in favour of this extrapolation .",
    "in this paper we have presented a relation between cosmic density and velocity fields following a purely lagrangian derivation ( eq.([result ] ) ) that is self - consistent in the second - order model .",
    "the advantage of working in the lagrangian picture is that the over - density field obtained from the continuity equation is self - consistent and automatically satisfies conservation of momentum . for simplicity",
    ", one can adopt the condition ( [ parallelism ] ) of parallelism of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath55 , satisfied at first order and by a large class of irrotational solutions in second - order lagrangian perturbation theory , and the result ( [ result ] ) holds accurately at both orders . however , as pointed out in sect .",
    "3 , we note that ( [ parallelism ] ) is not a sine qua non condition but a weaker condition of parallelism of the gradients of the fields would yield the same result .",
    "it is shown that this condition is well satisfied for generic initial conditions . in each case , the function @xmath59 is given explicitly in appendix b.1 and appendix b.2 respectively .",
    "its range of validity is limited by the epoch when the inversion map @xmath157 becomes singular , i.e. up to orbit - crossing time , while its principal range of validity should strictly be estimated by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 $ ] is the displacement field with respect to the hubble - flow .",
    "this condition is probably very conservative in view of the success of these approximations if followed up to shell - crossing .    by specifying the initial data at @xmath163 and keeping only the leading terms in the solutions , we are able to recover the leading terms of previous reconstruction models as shown in sect .",
    "furthermore , the time dependence of the orbits in our model is established by solving the lagrange - newton system at each order .",
    "this leads to a unique and consistent result for the eulerian density constrast in terms of the peculiar - velocities .",
    "we finally wish to show some skepticism about the usefulness of the reconstruction formulae given .",
    "we want them to be applicable to present day observational data",
    ". however , we know confidently that shell - crossing has occurred , i.e. the interesting regime is no longer covered .",
    "instead one would have to investigate a relationship between _ smoothed _ cosmic over - density and peculiar - velocity fields , where the smoothing window scale has to ensure the absence of vorticity and multi - stream systems in the average flow .",
    "given the present work we should ask whether there is a formally proper way to incorporate smoothing into a consistent lagrangian reconstruction formalism . with regard to this point , we think that solutions of the lagrange - newton system may possibly provide reasonable tools for reconstructing average fields , since averages in eulerian space of any vector function @xmath164 are straightforward to calculate : @xmath165 .",
    "however , we still encounter the fundamental problem of averaging over multi - stream flows , which may not be properly handled in the framework of the lagrange - newton system .",
    "rather , such a description has to be based on an approximation of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "this major improvement of the methods lies well beyond the scope of present reconstruction techniques and requires the construction of vlasov - poisson type approximations .",
