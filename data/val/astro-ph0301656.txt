    "the first deep infrared ( ir ) observations of stars in the bulge of our galaxy were carried out by @xcite .",
    "measuring the luminosity function ( lf ) using the m giant grism surveys of @xcite and @xcite , they found many luminous giants , but noticed that the lf has a sharp break at @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , with the brightest stars extending to @xmath7 .",
    "the tip of red giant branch ( rgb ) , defined by the core mass required for helium flash , occurs at a luminosity of @xmath8 .",
    "any stars brighter than this limit are therefore on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "the stars observed in the galactic bulge extend @xmath9 magnitudes brighter than the tip of the rgb .",
    "since metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath10 ) galactic globular clusters do not exhibit such luminous agb stars , this might have suggested a younger age for the bulge population , since the luminosity of the brightest agb stars increases with decreasing age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however metal - rich globular clusters do have stars which can reach luminosities of @xmath11 , while still having ages comparable to the metal poor clusters @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the stellar population of the galactic bulge is dominated by metal - rich stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath12 ) @xcite that are as old as galactic globular clusters @xcite , and that the number of stars brighter than the rgb tip is consistent with the frequency observed in old , metal rich globular clusters . in summary ,",
    "the stellar population in the bulge of the milky way is as old as the oldest galactic globular clusters , and old , metal rich stellar populations are able to produce agb stars only as bright as @xmath13 .",
    "work was already underway studying stars in other nearby galaxies to determine whether the properties of the stars in the galactic bulge are typical of all bulges .",
    "the nearest and brightest large spiral , m31 ( the andromeda galaxy ) was the obvious first choice for a comparison .",
    "some of the first measurements of stars in the inner bulge of m31 ( @xmath14 kpc from the nucleus ) were made by @xcite .",
    "he found that m31 s brightest bulge stars were @xmath14 magnitude more luminous than the brightest stars in m31 s halo .",
    "@xcite then took spectra of some of these bright stars , and found most to have properties characteristic of late - type m giants .",
    "it was unclear what was causing the apparent difference between the stellar populations of the bulges of the milky way and m31 .",
    "the dependence of the agb peak luminosity on mass ( and therefore age and mass loss ) and metallicity pointed to several possible explanations for this observed difference .",
    "however , all of these explanations implied a difference in the formation or evolutionary processes of these two otherwise very similar galaxies .    to see if the luminous stars in m31 are indeed similar to those found in the bulge of the milky way , @xcite measured a sample of @xmath15 stars in the inner bulge of m31 @xmath16 from the nucleus with the hale 5 m reflector ( see  [ sec : rm91 ] ) .",
    "their resulting lf had a drop at @xmath17 , similar to that seen in bw , but extended to @xmath18 .",
    "to explain these excess luminous stars they proposed several theories .",
    "( 1 ) these stars could be younger stars from the disk superposed on the bulge .",
    "( 2 ) they could be super - metal - rich in chemical composition , since the luminosity of the brightest agb stars increases with metallicity .",
    "( 3 ) the bulge of m31 could have a young stellar component , since the luminosity of the brightest agb stars increases with decreasing age @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) they could be the result of merged lower - mass main - sequence stars ( blue straggler progenitors ) , which produces more massive and luminous stars .    soon thereafter , @xcite imaged the m31 bulge in the near - ir using the 3.8 m ukirt facility , albeit @xmath19 from the nucleus , a factor of two more distant than rich .",
    "their lf has an upper limit @xmath20 mag brighter than that seen in the galactic bulge .",
    "they argued that contamination by stars from a young disk , which lies behind the bulge , is most likely responsible for the luminous stars observed by rm91 .",
    "@xcite carried out a @xmath21-band survey of @xmath22 stars in 604 arcmin@xmath23 of baade s window to check the possibility that the m giant surveys in the bulge of the mw @xcite may have missed very luminous stars similar to the ones seen in the bulge of m31 .",
    "the @xcite observations turned up no such population of luminous stars , and their derived lf is consistent with that obtained by @xcite . in order to compare their galactic bulge observations with those of the bulge of m31",
    ", @xcite rebinned and smoothed their image to simulate the m31 observations .",
    "the resulting degraded image showed that few if any of the `` stars '' on this simulated m31 field corresponded to individual stars on the original image ; most were just random groupings of stars .",
    "a quantitative analysis showed that the extreme crowding caused an artificial brightening in the lf of more than one magnitude .",
    "they thus concluded that the luminous stars seen in m31 s bulge were most likely not real , but an artifact of image crowding .    at nearly the same time @xcite acquired new observations of five fields in the bulge of m31 with the palomar ir imager on the hale 5 m telescope ( see  [ sec : rmg93 ] ) . by measuring the lfs in fields with different expected disk contributions from 2 to 11 arcminutes from the nucleus",
    ", they rejected the hypothesis of @xcite that the bright stars are disk contaminants . using their own model fields , which showed that they could accurately measure the gb tip despite the crowding",
    ", they also argued against the idea of @xcite that the bright stars are stellar blends .",
    "while they did concede that some of their measurements may have been affected by crowding of up to 1 magnitude , they maintained that they were not generally measuring clusters of blended images .",
    "further calculations by @xcite also showed the numbers of blue straggler progeny stars to be insufficient to explain the number of luminous stars .    in pursuit of a resolution to this controversy",
    ", @xcite obtained hst wide - field planetary camera ( wfpc1 ) observations of the inner bulge of m31 .",
    "regretfully , these observations were taken with hst s original aberrated optics , reducing the effective resolution to barely better than was available from the ground .",
    "these observations also yielded many luminous stars , although not quite as bright as previously measured .",
    "the data also suggested that the brightest stars may be concentrated toward the center of m31 .    approaching this problem from the theoretical side , @xcite performed calculations to estimate the number of stars in all evolutionary stages in each pixel .",
    "he showed that the number of blends increases quadratically with both the surface brightness of the target and with the angular resolution of the observations . applying these calculations to existing photometric data for the inner bulge of m31",
    ", he concluded that all previous ground - based observations were dominated by blends , and even questioned the hst observations of @xcite , pointing to the measured blue @xmath24 colors as indicative of their blended origin .    with the wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 )",
    ", @xcite observed three fields in the bulge of m31 at optical wavelengths . with hst s improved resolution , they did not find stars more luminous than those in the galactic bulge , and concluded that previous detections of very bright stars were likely the result of blended stars due to the crowding in wfpc1 and ground - based images .",
    "however , since even very luminous evolved stars can go undetected at optical wavelengths due to molecular blanketing , @xcite recently obtained new infrared images of the bulge of m31 with the 3.6 m cfht . with the help of adaptive optics ( ao ) ,",
    "his @xmath25 observations confirm the optical non - detection of very luminous stars made by @xcite .",
    "although there is agreement between the brightest stars measured by @xcite in the bulge of m31 and the brightest stars measured in the galactic bulge @xcite , the luminosity functions still show considerable differences .",
    "the m31 bulge lf measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 7 ) does _ not _ show a break at @xmath26 as is observed in bw , but instead shows a change in slope at @xmath27 and a break at @xmath28 , indicative of different star formation histories in the mw and m31 if correct .",
    "thus it appears that this decade - old controversy has not yet been completely resolved . while there now appears to be agreement that the brightest of the previous measurements were blends , it is still not certain whether the luminosity functions of the bulges of the milky way and m31 are consistent with one another . in this paper",
    "we will show that indeed they are , and that even the most recent observations , including our own , are still affected by blending in the inner regions of m31 .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start by describing our observations in section [ sec : observations ] , and our reduction and photometric techniques in section [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "we present the color magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions in sections [ sec : cmds ] and [ sec : lfs ] respectively .",
    "section [ sec : blending ] gives a brief theoretical analysis of blending in m31 , followed by detailed simulations of all our fields in section [ sec : simulations ] . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare our measurements with previous observations ; @xcite in  [ sec : rmg93 ] , @xcite in  [ sec : rm91 ] , and @xcite in  [ sec : davidge ] .",
    "section [ sec : brightstars ] discusses the bright stars which appear to be galactic foreground stars , and we conclude with a brief summary of our results in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we analyze images of m31 taken from two different nicmos proposals .",
    "proposal 7876 imaged the five central fields of @xcite .",
    "these fields were carefully chosen to sample varying bulge / disk ratios , and are indicated by f1f5 on figure [ fig : fields ] .",
    "proposal 7826 imaged five globular clusters in m31 .",
    "the four fields used in this study are indicated on figure [ fig : fields ] by their cluster numbers : f170 , f174 , f177 and f280 .",
    "we omit the g1 field from this analysis , since at 34 kpc from the center of m31 , the frame is dominated by cluster stars .",
    "since the nic1 and nic2 cameras are at different positions in the hst focal plane , we can simultaneously image 2 fields at each pointing ( see figure [ fig : sbmap ] ) . the nic2 field is @xmath29 across , and separated by @xmath30 from the @xmath31 nic1 field ( @xmath32 between field centers ) .",
    "their different sizes are due to their different spatial resolutions ; the nic1 images have a plate scale of @xmath33 pixel@xmath34 , compared to the @xmath35 pixel@xmath34 of nic2 .",
    "having different resolutions at each pointing will prove useful for understanding the severe crowding very near the center of m31 .",
    "our observations are summarized in table [ tab : observations ] .",
    "the top half of the table lists our nic1 observations , and the second half is for nic2 .",

    "a detailed description of the technique is given in appendix [ app : nic1cal ] .",
    "the selection criteria are also slightly different for stars measured in the nic1 and nic2 fields . for the nic2 frames we require measurements in all three bands , with psf - fitting errors smaller than 0.25 magnitudes in each band . for nic1 , with only @xmath76-band observations",
    ", we only require that the psf - fitting error be less than 0.25 magnitudes .",

    "the rgb and agb are both visible in these cmds .",
    "the tip of the rgb is more clearly defined in the less crowded fields , and a differential bolometric lf shows that it occurs at @xmath97 . in the more crowded fields the rgb tip gets blurred because of blending , which pushes stars up off of the rgb .",
    "the tip of the bulge agb extends to @xmath3 .",
    "this agb tip is significantly fainter than previously claimed , and we address this in a comparison with previous observations in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "long - period variables ( lpvs ) are large amplitude , luminous red variable stars with periods ranging from 50 to several hundred days",
    ". these stars are on the agb and represent the brief final stages of low- to intermediate - mass stellar evolution on the giant branch . based on measurements of variables in the galactic bulge @xcite , we have marked the region of each cmd where we expect to find primarily lpvs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmds ] ) .",
    "this region is indicated by a dashed box in the upper right of each cmd , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "since image blending generally shifts objects to bluer colors @xcite , this region should be relatively insensitive to crowding causing spurious lpv candidates , although in extreme cases , lpvs may actually be shifted blueward _ out _ of the box , thus only giving us a lower limit to the number of lpvs .",
    "a casual comparison of this lpv region between fields shows that some of the cmds , particularly from the inner fields , have many more potential lpvs .",
    "since the relative numbers and luminosities of lpvs are sensitive to the age and/or metallicity of the parent population , lpvs can be used to look for field - to - field variations in the stellar population .",
    "@xcite argue that the relative number of lpvs to non - variable giants is independent of [ fe / h ] for [ fe / h]@xmath100 , and for higher metallicities the lpv lifetime is significantly reduced due to increased mass loss rates .",
    "thus for stellar systems with a super - solar metallicity component , the ratio of non - variables to lpvs will appear high compared to lower metallicity systems .",
    "this idea seems to be supported by their determination of a higher non - variable giants to lpv ratio in the galactic bulge compared to globular clusters .    to determine whether there is a change in the relative numbers of lpv candidates among our fields , we compare their numbers to the number of nonvariable giants , classified by having @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the ratio of giants to lpvs for each of our nic2 fields is shown in figure [ fig : lpvs ] as a function of bulge / disk ratio .",
    "this plot shows no trend in the giant / lpv ratio , instead all of our observations are scattered around the average ratio of n(giants)/n(lpvs)@xmath103 .",
    "thus the lpvs appear to be uniformly distributed with the nonvariable stars .",
    "the @xmath76-band lfs measured in all 18 fields are shown in figure [ fig : jlfs ] and listed in table [ tab : jlfs ] in units of number per magnitude per square arcsecond .",
    "the figure shows both the nic1 and nic2 lfs overplotted for each field .",
    "the first thing to note about this compilation of m31 lfs is that the nic1 and nic2 measurements are not exactly the same .",
    "while most show good agreement , several of the nic2 lfs extend to brighter magnitudes , and all of the nic1 lfs extend fainter .",
    "the faint end differences are a combined result of the longer exposure times and better spatial resolution of nic1 .",
    "the nic1 exposure times are nearly four times longer than those of the @xmath76-band nic2 observations .",
    "this is because while nic2 was cycling through all three @xmath76,@xmath77 & @xmath21 filters , nic1 observed only through the @xmath76-band filter .",
    "the faint end photometry is also affected by the level of crowding in the field .",
    "nic2 is undersampled at @xmath76 , making it more difficult to distinguish close objects . thus in very crowded fields",
    ", nic1 has an advantage over nic2 , accounting for the larger faint - end difference seen in the more crowded fields .",
    "there are several reasons for the differences seen at the bright end .",
    "the first is the difference in the field of view of each camera .",
    "nic2 covers an area on the sky three times that of nic1 , and thus has a much better chance of finding the rarer brighter stars .",
    "second is resolution and image sampling .",
    "nic1 has a well sampled @xmath76-band psf with a fwhm of @xmath84 , while the nic2 @xmath76-band psf is undersampled with a larger fwhm of @xmath85 .",
    "also , the nic2 photometric calibration requires detections in all three bands .",
    "thus the limiting resolution for nic2 is actually the @xmath21-band , which has a fwhm of @xmath87 , nearly twice the size of the nic1 @xmath76-band psf .",
    "the combined result is that the nic2 observations are more sensitive to blending , which can artificially brighten stars , extending the bright end of the lf . finally , there is the coincidence that most of the nic1 observations occur in regions of slightly fainter surface brightnesses than their nic2 counterparts ( see table [ tab : observations ] and figure [ fig : sbmap ] ) , somewhat exacerbating both aforementioned effects .",
    "the @xmath21-band nic2 lfs are shown in figure [ fig : klfs ] and listed in table [ tab : klfs ] , both normalized to give number / arcsec@xmath23/magnitude .",
    "although nic1 is more resilient against blending , both nic1 and nic2 observations are susceptible to its ill effects ( see  [ sec : simulations ] ) . however , under the hypothesis that all the measured bulge lfs arise from a single true lf , and that the differences are purely a result of blending , we estimate that the tip of the agb occurs at @xmath104 and @xmath27 .",

measurements made in baade s window ( bw ) , with the bright end ( @xmath105 ) from @xcite and the faint end from @xcite .",
    "all the lfs have been normalized in the range @xmath106 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : compbw ] is a comparison between bw and the seven bulge fields in our sample .",
    "these fields all have bulge - to - disk ratios greater than one , as listed in table [ tab : observations ] .",
    "these fields are all of very high surface brightness , and therefore we expect most to exhibit some amount of artificial brightening due to blending .",
    "however , as the plot shows , there is still very good agreement between these m31 bulge fields and the bulge of the mw .",
    "thus based on our infrared luminosity functions , the stellar population of bulge of m31 is very similar to that of the milky way .",
    "the match up between the lfs is quite good , and when one takes into account our prediction of a small amount of artificial brightening due to blending in our most crowded bulge fields , the correspondence will be even better .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : compbw ] is a comparison between bw and the two disk fields in our sample .",
    "the f2 & f280 fields both have bulge - to - disk ratios less than one ( see table [ tab : observations ] ) .",
    "these two fields also have the lowest surface brightnesses , which means that the effects of blending are the least , and hence their photometric measurements are the most trustworthy .",
    "however in this comparison , we see that both of these disk lfs extend slightly brighter than the break measured in bw , and do so more prominently than any of the bulge fields .    in order to determine whether or not the measured disk and bulge luminosity functions are in fact distinguishable from one another",
    ", we compare the distributions of stellar luminosities using the ks - test .",
    "we combine the f2 and f280 measurements to represent the disk population , and use all other fields for the bulge population .",
    "incompleteness in the more crowded fields limits the comparison to only bright stars with @xmath107 , and in this range the ks - test shows a conspicuous overabundance of luminous disk stars in the range @xmath108 .",
    "however the significance is low , with @xmath109 , indicating that the two populations are nonetheless consistent with being drawn from the same parent population .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we limit the comparison to only the agb ( @xmath110 ) , the excess of luminous disk stars is enough to drop the ks @xmath111value to @xmath112 .",
    "this low probability is marginally significant , but is based on a much smaller number of stars ( 12 disk stars and 729 bulge stars ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the simulations (  [ sec : simulations ] ) show no such enhancement .    in summary ,",
    "both of the two disk fields have a slight excess of luminous stars with @xmath108 , although only statistically significant when compared to the bulge fields over a small range in luminosity .",
    "this small overabundance of agb stars just above the baade s window lf break is due to the presence of younger disk stars in these two fields .",
    "in order to analytically estimate the effects of blending on our observations , we have used the equations of @xcite to predict number of stars in each evolutionary stage per resolution element .",
    "several parameters in this calculation have a weak dependence on the age , metallicity , and imf of the assumed stellar population . for these parameters ,",
    "we choose to use a ratio of total to @xmath21-band luminosity of @xmath113 , and a specific evolutionary flux",
    "@xmath114 stars yr@xmath34 l@xmath115@xmath34 , both suitable for a solar - metallicity , 15 gyr old population .    to try to estimate the importance of blending on fields at different distances from m31",
    ", we have calculated the number of rgb stars within 1 magnitude of the rgb tip , @xmath116 .",
    "since the brightest stars in our fields are only @xmath14 magnitude brighter than the expected tip of the rgb , a blend with even one rgbt star will distort their measurement by @xmath117 .",
    "the results of these calculations are displayed in figure [ fig : nrgbt_reselement ] .",
    "the left panel shows the number of rgbt stars per resolution element as a function of surface brightness for four different imaging resolutions .",
    "the @xmath118 resolution roughly corresponds to nicmos , @xmath119 is the resolution of the @xcite observations , and @xmath120 corresponds to the resolution obtained by @xcite . as an example of using this plot , consider an image with @xmath119 resolution taken at a location where the @xmath21-band surface brightness is 14.5 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath34 .",
    "that image would have , on average , 1 rgbt star in each resolution element ; obviously not conditions favorable for accurate photometry .    to make this plot easier to interpret , on the right side of figure [ fig : nrgbt_reselement ]",
    "we show the number of rgbt stars per resolution element as a function of position in m31 , using the same four imaging resolutions . to convert from the @xmath21-band surface brightness in the left panel to radius in the right panel , we have used the @xmath36-band surface brightness measurements of @xcite , and we assume that @xmath121 . following through with the previous example",
    ", we see that with @xmath119 resolution , we would find approximately 1 per resolution element at a distance of @xmath122 from the center of m31 along its major axis .",
    "the question then becomes , what is the limit for `` good '' photometry ? while it seems quite obvious what would be bad , i.e. one or more rgbt star per resolution element , what is `` good '' is more difficult to quantify , and requires knowledge of exactly how good `` good '' needs to be .",
    "clearly , if @xmath116 is less than one , @xmath116 is approximately the probability that a star within one magnitude of the rgb tip will fall in any given resolution element .",
    "thus @xmath123 is the probability that a resolution element will contain a blend of two rgbt stars .",
    "therefore the number , and severity of the blends which can be accepted determine the limiting surface brightness .",
    "@xcite have run simulations on their nicmos photometry of globular clusters in m31 , and find that for accurate photometry of stars down to @xmath124 , @xmath116/resolution element should be @xmath125 . while this is a good guide , to better understand the observations at different resolutions and surface brightnesses , it is best to perform simulations to attempt to quantify the effects of blending .",
    "to better understand the effects of blending we have run extensive simulations of each of our nicmos fields following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "we create an artificial field to match each observed field , and measure it in exactly the same manner as the real frame .",
    "since in the simulations we know both the measured and true magnitude of every star in the field , we can try to estimate the true properties of the observed stellar population being modeled , free from observational effects .",
    "one of the goals of this work was to look for variations in the stellar populations with varying galactocentric distance and bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "however , the severe crowding , strong dependence of blending on surface brightness , and degeneracy between surface brightness and bulge - to - disk ratio make this question very difficult to answer .",
    "thus one of the main purposes of our simulations is to determine whether all of our observations are consistent with a single stellar population . to make this determination , we have generated artificial frames using the stellar properties measured in some of the least crowded fields .",
    "if the measured differences between fields are just due to observational effects , the simulations should exhibit the same differences .",
    "the simulations are complicated by the fact that the data come from four different instrument configurations , each with different exposure times , plate scales , and dither sizes . for _ each _",
    "configuration , each dither starts as a blank frame having the appropriate noise characteristics .",
    "we then randomly add stars using the daophot addstar routine , until we have approximately matched the observed stellar density in the field being modeled .",
    "the psfs used to add stars are the average of the psfs determined from each field for each configuration , with any negative values in the model psf set to zero .",
    "the addstar routine also incorporates random poisson noise into each star as it is added .",
    "the input stellar population was chosen to match the colors and luminosity function observed in the least - crowded bulge fields .",
    "the colors are the mean colors observed in fields 4 & 5 , calculated at 0.5 magnitude intervals .",
    "the input lf is a broken power law with a faint end slope of 0.278 extending from @xmath126 , and a bright - end slope of 1.100 from @xmath127 .",
    "the faint - end slope was taken from the galactic bulge @xcite , while the breakpoint and bright - end slope were determined from the nic1 @xmath76-band lfs , since it was felt that they were the most robust against the effects of blending .",
    "the artificial frames were then processed and measured in exactly the same manner as the real data , namely finding stars on a combined image with daofind , then measuring all dithers simultaneously with allframe .",
    "the number of input stars was varied to approximately match the number of detected stars on each frame , although the measured lf morphology was also taken into account for some of higher density fields .",
    "table [ tab : simulations ] lists the number of artificial stars input into each simulated frame , as well as the number of stars recovered from both the real and simulated fields .",
    "the results of the simulations of a single camera ( nic2 ) and a single field ( f1 ) are summarized in figure [ fig : sims ] .",
    "this is the most crowded field , and hence the effects of blending are the most severe .",
    "the _ simulated _ @xmath76-band image is shown in the upper left , and is nearly indistinguishable from the real observations ( fig . [ fig:7876nic2fields ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath128,@xmath129 cmd is shown in the upper right .",
    "the input stars form a narrow locus which blends into a line stretching ( on this plot ) from @xmath130 and @xmath131 to @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the locus of measured stars is broader and shifted brighter and bluer compared to the input stars .",
    "as the simulations show , when the field is this crowded , _ none _ of our measurements are very accurate .",
    "the input and recovered luminosity functions are shown at the bottom of figure [ fig : sims ] .",
    "the @xmath76-band lfs on the left show that the measured lf is shifted by @xmath20 magnitudes brighter than the input lf .",
    "the lfs on the right show that , the @xmath21-band measurements are not as severely distorted as the undersampled nic2 @xmath76-band observations .",
    "the first statistic we calculate is the difference between the brightest star measured and the brightest star input into each artificial field .",
    "this gives a rough idea of the maximum amount of brightening one can expect in each field .",
    "figure [ fig : deltamag ] illustrates this difference for the @xmath76,@xmath77 , and @xmath21-bands as a function of field surface brightness .",
    "this plot shows that there is little brightening due to blending in the artificial fields with lower surface brightnesses ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "however , as the surface brightness increases , the amount of artificial brightening increases as well .",
    "the size of each circle in figure [ fig : deltamag ] indicates whether the simulation is a nic1 ( small circles ) or nic2 ( large circles ) field . the higher resolution and",
    "more finely sampled nic1 observations are clearly less affected by blending , with only a few fields having deviations greater than 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "this figure also shows that the brightest @xmath21-band data are less affected by blending than the corresponding @xmath76-band measurements . for the most crowded fields ( e.g. f1 , f177 , f174 , f3 ) the @xmath76-band brightening due",
    "to blending can be as high as 0.75 magnitudes , while in the @xmath21-band , blending is @xmath135 magnitudes less .",
    "this can also be seen in the larger difference between the input and recovered lfs at @xmath76 compared to @xmath21 , and the blueward shift of stars in the cmd as seen in figure [ fig : sims ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we attribute the difference between @xmath76 & @xmath21 to the undersampling in @xmath76 and the bluer color of the underlying population .",
    "the delta - magnitude quantity previously calculated is admittedly subject to small number statistics , since it is based on only a single star in each field .",
    "ideally we would run each simulation a number of times , and the average difference would be a much more robust estimator of the amount of brightening to expect in the real field .",
    "however , looking at the results of all the fields together , the direction and magnitude of the effect is clear .",
    "another interesting , and hopefully more robust , quantity to calculate for each field is the ratio of the number of `` bright '' stars measured compared to the number of stars input to the same brightness .",
    "this quantity is very important , for example when using agb stars to assess recent star formation .",
    "we plot this ratio as a function of the field surface brightness in figure [ fig : ratio ] .",
    "we chose @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 as the criterion for a star to be considered `` bright '' .",
    "these limits are fairly arbitrary , however if chosen to be much brighter , then some of the fields will have no stars input that bright , and if much fainter , some fields will not be complete to that level , and we will be measuring completeness instead of blending .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows the ratio of measured to input bright stars for all of our simulated frames .",
    "the large circles represent nic2 fields and the small circles nic1 fields .",
    "the lowest surface brightness fields ( f2 & f280 ) have nearly equal numbers of measured and input stars , i.e. minimal blending .",
    "however , as the surface brightness increases , the points begin to move up off of the dashed line indicating a ratio of unity .",
    "this upturn is a function of wavelength , but in general occurs at @xmath139 mag / arcsec@xmath23 for the nic2 observations , and @xmath140 mag / arcsec@xmath23 for the nic1 observations . in the simulations of the brightest fields we measure about twice as many bright stars in nic2 , and 1.25 times as many in nic1 compared to the number which were actually input into the simulation .",
    "of course the ratio of the number of measured to input stars is dependent on exactly where one draws cutoff magnitude . at brighter cutoff magnitudes",
    "the ratio goes to infinity when there are no stars input as bright as we measure . choosing a fainter cutoff",
    "both dilutes the number of blends , and causes faint blends to be lost due to incompleteness .    in summary ,",
    "both figures [ fig : deltamag ] and [ fig : ratio ] show similar structure , with a sharp increase in blending between @xmath141 .",
    "obviously the amount of blending one can withstand depends on the scientific goals , however one must be very careful interpreting results from such data .",
    "we are even skeptical of some of our own measurements of stars just above the tip of the agb , which only occur in the most crowded fields where the surface brightness is greater than @xmath142 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath4 ( however see  [ sec : brightstars ] ) .",

    "analytic estimates of the effects of blending on our observations , where we calculate the number of rgb stars within 1 magnitude of the rgb tip as a function of position in m31 , indicate that simulations are required to accurately interpret our observations .",
    "we thus perform extensive simulations of each of our nicmos fields following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that for the most crowded fields we can expect the brightening due to blending to be as high as 0.75 magnitudes in @xmath76 and 0.55 magnitudes in @xmath21 .",
    "they also show that the ratio of measured to input bright stars is a strong function of the field surface brightness . in the highest surface brightness field",
    "we measure about 25% more bright stars than were input with nic1 , and about twice as many with nic2 .",
    "all of the bulge luminosity functions are consistent with a single , uniform bulge population .",
    "this is based on the observation that the small differences we see are correlated with surface brightness , and that the simulations predict similar differences .",
    "we note however , that our simulations only verify that a single lf combined with blending can produce the observed field - to - field differences . thus our observations are _ consistent _ with a single bulge lf , but without higher resolution data , small field to field differences can not be ruled out .",

    "our nic2 observations were chosen to be centered on the rmg93 fields , and since the nic1 and nic2 focal planes are so close together ( @xmath30 between field edges ) and nicmos was rotated @xmath199 degrees from north when we took most of our images , nic1 falls on the lower left ( se ) corner of the rmg93 images ( see figure [ fig : sbmap ] ) . by rebinning and smoothing our nic1 images we were able to match up 8 `` stars '' with rmg93 .",
    "of course these are nt really single stars , but rather clumps of many stars . however , by estimating how many stars are in the clumps measured by rmg93 , we were able to use their observations to transform ours to the cit / ctio system .",
