    "characterizing the nature of correlations in composite quantum systems is one of the fundamental problems in quantum theory .",
    "when the system is prepared in a pure state , only entanglement is responsible for the presence of quantum correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "once mixed states are taken into account , the problem becomes much more involved .",
    "some features of separable mixed states are incompatible with a classical description of correlations .",
    "the most important among them is that a measurement on a part of composite system in some non - entangled states can induce disturbance on the state of complementary subsystem .",
    "such `` non - classical '' behavior can be quantified by quantum discord - the most promising measure of bipartite quantum correlations beyond quantum entanglement @xcite . for pure states discord",
    "coincides with entanglement , but in the case of mixed states discord and entanglement differ significantly .",
    "for example it was shown that almost all quantum states have non - vanishing discord @xcite and even local operations on the measured part can increase or create quantum discord @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we quantify non - classical correlations which may differ from entanglement by using geometric quantum discord .",
    "this quantity is defined in terms of minimal distance of the given state from the set of classically - correlated states , so the proper choice of such a distance is crucial .",
    "the measure proposed in @xcite uses a hilbert - schmidt norm to define a distance in the set of states .",
    "this choice has a technical advantage : the minimization process can be realized analytically for arbitrary two - qubit states . despite of this feature , this measure has some unwanted properties .",
    "the most important problem is that it may increase under local operations performed on the unmeasured subsystem @xcite .",
    "fortunately , by using other norm in the set of states , this defect can be repaired : the best choice is to use schatten 1-norm ( or trace norm ) to define quantum discord @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "such defined measure is more difficult to compute . the closed formula for it is known only in the case of bell - diagonal states or x - shaped two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "the main scope of this paper is to reconsider the properties of those two measures of quantum discord in a concrete physical system where the quantum channel is given by the time evolution . as a compound system",
    "we take two independent two - level atoms not completely isolated from the environment . in this case",
    "the time evolution is given by a dissipative process of spontaneous emission .",
    "one - sided spontaneous emission in which only one atom emits photons and the other is isolated from the environment , gives the physical realization of local quantum channel .",
    "although it was already established @xcite , in this framework we can explicitly show that hilbert - schmidt norm discord has nonphysical properties with respect to the local evolution and the better choice is to use trace norm . in particular we discuss the local creation of discord when the system is prepared in classical initial state @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have studied time evolution of hilbert - schmidt quantum discord @xmath0 , now we compare it with the behavior of trace norm quantum discord @xmath1 .",
    "the results of our analysis show that when only the local creation of quantum discord in the classical initial state is considered , @xmath0 and @xmath1 provide the same information about the evolution of quantum correlations .",
    "this is no longer true when the initial states have non - zero discord",
    ". local evolution can increase quantum discord and this phenomenon can be observed by using @xmath1 or @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are initial states with decreasing quantum correlations quantified by @xmath1 whereas @xmath0 is increasing .",
    "the most spectacular manifestation of nonphysical properties of hilbert - schmidt norm discord is its behavior during the local evolution of the unmeasured subsystem .",
    "@xmath0 not only increases for a large class of initial discordant states ( at the same time @xmath1 obviously decreases ) but also it can increase even when the local evolution of the measured subsystem leads to decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this shows again that in contrast to trace norm discord , hilbert - schmidt norm discord can not serve as a reasonable measure of quantum correlations .",
    "we start with the introduction of the standard notion of geometric quantum discord @xcite .",
    "when a @xmath2 bipartite system @xmath3 is prepared in a state @xmath4 and we perform local measurement on the subsystem @xmath5 , almost all states @xmath4 will be disturbed due to such measurement .",
    "the ( one - sided ) geometric discord @xmath6 can be defined as the minimal disturbance , measured by the squared hilbert - schmidt distance , induced by any projective measurement @xmath7 on subsystem @xmath5 i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 here we adopt normalized version of the geometric discord , introduced in ref . @xcite . in the case of two qubits",
    ", there is an explicit expression for @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath10 where the components of the vector @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 the matrix @xmath13 has elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath16 . despite of being easy to compute , the measure @xmath0 fails as a quantifier of quantum correlations , since it may increase under local operations on the unmeasured subsystem @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we explicitly show that one - sided spontaneous emission of the unmeasured atom can create additional discord quantified by @xmath0 in the system of two independent atoms .",
    "such defect of @xmath0 originates in the properties of hilbert -schmidt norm , which manifests also in the case of entanglement @xcite .    to repair this defect ,",
    "one considers other norms in the set of quantum states .",
    "the best choice is to use the trace norm ( or schatten 1-norm ) and define @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath1 has desired properties with respect to the local operations on unmeasured subsystem , but its computation is much more involved .",
    "analytic expression for @xmath1 is known only for limited classes of two - qubits states , including bell - diagonal @xcite and @xmath19 - shaped mixed states @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we consider @xmath19 - shaped two - qubit states @xmath20 where all matrix elements are real and non - negative .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 for such states can be computed as follows .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 then @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 notice that we use normalized version of @xmath1 and the formula ( [ disc1 ] ) is not valid in the case when @xmath25 and @xmath26 in such a case , one can use general prescription how to compute @xmath1 , also given in ref .",

    "( 65 ) ) .    in the case of pure states , @xmath1 as well as @xmath0 give the same information about quantum correlations as entanglement measured by negativity @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes partial transposition of @xmath4 .",
    "in the case of mixed states , entanglement and discord significantly differ .",
    "for example for two - qubit bell - diagonal states one finds that @xcite @xmath29 the inequality @xmath30 was proved to be valid for all two - qubit mixed states @xcite , and it is conjectured that ( [ d1d2 ] ) is also valid for all two - qubit states .    to show that inequalities in ( [ d1d2 ] ) can be sharp , consider the following family of states @xcite @xmath31 0&0&0&0\\\\[2 mm ] 0&0&\\frac{1}{2}&0\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{1}{4}\\sin 2{\\theta}&0&0&\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^{2}{\\theta}\\end{pmatrix},\\label{rote}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 $ ] . by direct computation",

    "we take into account only the dissipative process of spontaneous emission , so the dynamics of the system is given by the master equation @xcite @xmath41 where for @xmath42 @xmath43 in the above equation @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the single atom spontaneous emission rate .",
    "local evolution of the atom @xmath5 is given by `` one - sided '' spontaneous emission generated only by the generator @xmath46 i.e. @xmath47 in this case the atom @xmath5 spontaneously emits photons , whereas the atom @xmath40 is isolated from the environment .",
    "similarly we can consider one - sided spontaneous emission of the atom @xmath40 i.e. the evolution @xmath48 in what follows we consider the @xmath19 - shaped initial states ( [ x ] ) , where the matrix elements of @xmath4 are given with respect to the basis @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ground states and excited states of atoms @xmath5 and @xmath40 .",

    "one can check that @xmath101 and @xmath102    we start the analysis of time evolution of quantum correlations by considering first hilbert - schmidt discord @xmath0 . for the local spontaneous emission of the atom @xmath5 and initial state @xmath98 we have @xmath103 since @xmath104 ,",
    "only the relations between @xmath89 and @xmath91 are crucial for the behavior of @xmath0 .",

    "it can be shown that if @xmath106 , @xmath91 increases , whereas if @xmath107 , @xmath91 initially decreases and then start to increase .",
    "the production of an additional discord can happen only when @xmath108 is increasing function of @xmath79 and when @xmath109 i.e. when @xmath110 and @xmath111 the condition ( [ cond ] ) gives some restrictions on the possible values of the parameter @xmath105 in order to obtain production of discord .",
    "if we put @xmath112 into the inequality ( [ cond ] ) , we obtain the critical value of @xmath105 given by @xmath113 one can show that if @xmath114 , each pair @xmath115 where @xmath116 defines the initial state with only decreasing @xmath0 . on the other hand , if @xmath117 , a pair @xmath118 , gives the initial state with increasing discord .",
    "the values of @xmath105 greater then @xmath119 always give decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "now we consider trace norm discord @xmath1 .",
    "for the initial state @xmath98 we obtain @xmath120 so @xmath121 since the numerator of the right hand side of ( [ d1d ] ) increases only when @xmath122 and denominator always increases , for such values of @xmath105 , @xmath1 may increase for some period of time .",
    "detailed analysis of the formula ( [ d1d ] ) shows that similarly as in the case of @xmath0 , there is the critical value @xmath123 such that for any pair @xmath124 and admissible @xmath100 , the corresponding initial state gives decreasing discord @xmath1 , whereas any pair @xmath125 , defines initial state with growing @xmath1 .",
    "the crucial for this analysis is the fact that @xmath123 is slightly larger then @xmath126 ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , so there are the initial states corresponding to @xmath129 such that two measures of geometric discord behave very differently : @xmath0 grows for some period of time , whereas @xmath1 decreases for all @xmath79 ( see fig.3 ) .    for the initial states with values of @xmath105 between @xmath123 and @xmath119 , two measures of discord behave similarly : for a finite period of time , @xmath1 and @xmath0 grow to some maximal value and then start to decrease ( fig.4 ) .",
    "notice also that for the initial states with @xmath130 the function ( [ d1d ] ) decreases to zero at finite time @xmath131 and then starts to grow to some maximal value .",
    "the similar behavior can be observed also in the case of @xmath0 ( fig.5 ) .",
    "now we consider time evolution given by local spontaneous emission of atom @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath1 is non - increasing under local operations on subsystem @xmath40 , we only consider the properties of @xmath132 .",
    "it is given by formula ( [ d2b ] ) , where @xmath133 and @xmath134    one can check that in this case the function @xmath135 is increasing for all values of @xmath105 ( except of @xmath80 ) and the condition that @xmath136 is the same as in the case of evolution of atom @xmath5 .",
    "thus for all pairs @xmath137 where @xmath138,\\ ; w\\neq 1/4 $ ] , the corresponding initial state gives increasing @xmath0 under the local evolution of unmeasured subsystem @xmath40 .",
    "this happens even in the case when local evolution of measured atom @xmath5 leads to decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "it explicitly shows nonphysical properties of hilbert - schmidt discord @xmath0 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "we have studied local time evolution of quantum correlations given by geometric quantum discord in the system of independent two - level atoms interacting with environment at zero temperature .",
    "the dynamics is induced by the process of spontaneous emission and we have local dynamics when only one atom emits and the other is isolated from the environment . within this model",
    "we have compared the properties of hilbert - schmidt distance discord @xmath0 and trace distance discord @xmath1 .",
    "when the only local generation of discord in the classically correlated initial states is considered , @xmath1 and @xmath0 provide the similar information : for a large class of initial states with zero discord and local evolution of measured subsystem , @xmath1 as well as @xmath0 grows from zero to some maximal value and then decay to zero .",
    "moreover , local evolution of unmeasured subsystem in both cases gives the same result : @xmath1 and @xmath0 are equal to zero .",
    "local quantum operations can also increase the existing discord .",
    "we have shown that this phenomenon occurs also in our model of local evolutions for a large class of initially discordant states .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , now the behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath0 significantly differ .",
    "first of all @xmath0 increases under the local evolution of unmeasured subsystem .",
    "it happens even in such cases when it decreases under the evolution of a measured subsystem , which is manifestly nonphysical .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 can increase during the evolution of a measured subsystem whereas at the same time @xmath1 decreases .",
    "all those properties of @xmath0 suggests that it is not a reasonable measure of quantum correlations - more promising is to use trace distance discord @xmath1 .",
