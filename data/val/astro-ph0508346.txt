    "planetary nebulae ( pns ) are the descendents of intermediate ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) mass stars",
    ". the central star of a pn will evolve into a white dwarf with a mass between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath7 . while on the upper asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , much of the star s initial mass is lost in a more or less spherical outflow at rates of up to @xmath10 yr@xmath1 and at speeds of @xmath11 km s@xmath1 . as the star leaves the agb",
    ", the uv radiation from the emerging white dwarf ( wd ) ionizes the red giant ejecta , producing the short - lived ( @xmath12 yr ) pn .",
    "the star s surface escape velocity also increases at this stage , and its wind speed may increase to @xmath0 km s@xmath1 as its mass loss rate drops to @xmath13 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this fast wind is shocked as it collides with the previously ejected slow wind .",
    "this process is expected to play a role in pn shaping .",
    "these same wind - wind shocks are energetic enough to generate x - ray emission and , with the advent of the chandra x - ray observatory and xmm - newton , diffuse x - ray emission indeed has been detected in several pns @xcite .",
    "however , the degree to which wind - wind interactions contribute to pn x - ray emission likely varies from object to object .",
    "in particular , some pns display x - ray `` hot bubbles , '' as predicted by wind - wind interaction models ( e.g. , bd + 30@xmath143639 , @xcite ; ngc 7009 , @xcite ) , whereas the x - ray morphologies of other pns indicate that their x - ray emission is a direct consequence of jet activity ( e.g. , he 3 - 1475 , @xcite ; mz 3 , @xcite ) .",
    "planetaries harboring relatively cool , wc - type wolf - rayet central stars ( typically designated [ wcl ] objects ; e.g. , @xcite ) represent important test cases for understanding the origin and nature of x - ray emission from pns .",
    "the central stars of [ wcl ] pns are characterized by their overall spectral resemblance to `` bona - fide , '' massive wr stars , but as a group they extend to both hotter and cooler effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "the luminosities determined for the wc central stars of pns , given reasonable distance estimates , confirm that these stars are much less luminous than the wc remnants of massive stars and establish beyond doubt their post - agb nature .    key properties of the [ wcl]s indicate they should offer prime examples of strong wind - wind interactions in pns .",
    "the [ wcl ] central stars exhibit extreme hydrogen deficiency , similar to that of their likely progeny , the pg 1159-type pulsating white dwarfs @xcite . by virtue of the high opacity characteristic of a c- and o - enriched , yet h - depleted gas mix @xcite ,",
    "the [ wcl ] central stars develop powerful winds characterized by mass loss rates @xmath15 @xmath7 yr@xmath1 @xcite . the central star wind velocities of [ wcl]s range from @xmath16 to @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and appear correlated with spectral type , wherein the coolest [ wcl]s have the lowest wind speeds @xcite .",
    "these velocities are unusually large for such relatively cool central stars .",
    "the very large stellar wind momenta of [ wc ] pns appear to result in systematically larger nebular expansion velocities among these objects , relative to pns with h - rich central stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as a group , the [ wcl ] pns are characterized by dense , blobby structures and are rich in dust and molecular gas .",
    "these nebulae also tend to be relatively compact ; most feature optically bright shells with radii @xmath17 au @xcite which , given typical late agb expansion velocities ( @xmath18 km s@xmath1 ) , suggest they are quite young ( dynamical ages @xmath19 yr ) .    taken together , the foregoing suggests that the h abundances of [ wcl]s sharply declined just at the end of their agb evolution @xcite .",
    "hence , these stars have acquired large envelope opacities , resulting in strong winds  much stronger than in normal , h - rich central stars of pns .",
    "furthermore , the strong winds have emerged very early in post - agb evolution , before the remnant , ejected agb envelope has had time to disperse into the interstellar medium .",
    "thus , the [ wcl ] pns should make ideal tests for the theory of production of x - rays via interacting wind shocks , as the very large wind momenta of [ wcl ] central stars and the large , lingering masses of agb ejecta in [ wcl ] pns should offer precisely the right conditions for production of hot , post - shock gas at high emission measure .",
    "furthermore , the blobby and/or filamentary structure of [ wcl ] pns should favor heat conduction and mixing of `` hot bubble '' and nebular gas @xcite .",
    "indeed , among the prototype [ wcl ] objects is bd @xmath20 , the first well - established  and brightest  example of diffuse x - ray emission from a pn @xcite .",
    "the central star within the second - brightest diffuse x - ray pn , ngc 6543 , also has long been classified as wolf - rayet type @xcite .",
    "its wind speed and mass loss rate ( 1750 km s@xmath1 and @xmath21 @xmath7 yr@xmath1 , respectively ; @xcite ) are quite large , explaining the star s broad emission line spectrum .",
    "however , most of the key optical emission lines characteristic of the central stars of [ wc ] pns @xcite are not present in the spectrum of the central star of ngc 6543 ( de marco , unpublished ) , and the star is not h deficient @xcite .",
    "therefore , a [ wc ] classification is precluded . nevertheless ,",
    "ngc 6543 may represent a transient stage in the evolution of [ wc ] pns , as its central star may belong to a potentially related , `` weak emission line '' class @xcite .",
    "additional x - ray observations of [ wc ] pns should further clarify the role of post - agb fast winds in generating diffuse x - ray emission within pns .",
    "to this end , we used the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( cxo ) to search for x - ray emission from two well - studied [ wc ] pns , ngc 40 ( central star spectral type [ wc8 ] , fast wind speed @xmath22 km s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) and hen 2 - 99 ( [ wc9 ] , @xmath23 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the low - resolution optical morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , central star spectral types , fast wind speeds , and ( large ) central star mass loss rates ( @xmath24 @xmath7 yr@xmath1 ; @xcite ) of these two pns bear close resemblance to bd + 30@xmath253639 ( [ wc9 ] , @xmath26 km s@xmath1 , @xcite ; mass loss rate @xmath15 @xmath7 yr@xmath1 , @xcite ) . unlike bd + 30@xmath253639 and ngc 6543  both of which have been the subject of intensive , multi - epoch observing campaigns by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ; @xcite )  neither ngc 40 nor hen 2 - 99 has been the subject of deep hst imaging .",
    "the cxo observed hen 2 - 99 and ngc 40 , with the back - illuminated ccd s3 of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) as the focal plane instrument , on 2003 november 12 ( obsid 4480 ) and 2004 june 13 ( obsid 4481 ) , respectively .",
    "exposure times were 29 ks for hen 2 - 99 and 20 ks for ngc 40 .",
    "acis has a pixel size of @xmath27 and the field of view of acis - s3 is @xmath28 .",
    "the cxo / acis combination is sensitive over the energy range 0.310 kev .",
    "the data were subject to standard processing by the chandra x - ray center pipeline software ( ciao , v. 2.3 ) .",
    "we further applied energy - dependent subpixel event position corrections appropriate for back - illuminated ccd acis - s3 @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : n40imgs ] we present wiyn optical ( composite bvr ) and 2mass near - infrared ( j- and k - band ) images of ngc 40 along with the narrow - band ( 0.31 kev ) chandra / acis x - ray image ( raw and smoothed ) of the same region .",
    "the morphology of the @xmath3 diameter nebula is similar in these three optical / near - infrared images : in each case ngc 40 appears as a limb - brightened shell , with a bright rim that is interrupted by fainter protrusions to the north - northeast and south - southwest .",
    "deep optical images reveal jet - like features in the vicinity of each protrusion , although there is no kinematical evidence for collimated , fast outflows in ngc 40 @xcite .",
    "the detection of soft x - rays from ngc 40 is apparent upon extraction of a spectrum from a region of the chandra / acis image encompassing the optical / near - infrared nebula .",
    "this spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : n40rawspec ] .",
    "an image extracted over the soft ( 0.3 - 1.0 kev ) energy range spanned by the detected photons reveals that the x - ray emission arises from an annular region that lies nested just within , and follows the overall surface brightness distribution of , the bright , partial rim seen in the optical and near - infrared ( figs .",
    "[ fig : n40imgs ] , [ fig : n40color ] ) .    refining the spectral extraction region to an annulus with inner radius @xmath29 and outer radius of @xmath30 results in the background - subtracted spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : n40spectrum ] . the background - subtracted count rate of this diffuse emission was @xmath31 counts s@xmath1 , where the background region was defined as a circular region of radius @xmath3 lying @xmath32 se of ngc 40 .",
    "we used xspec ( v.  12.2.0 ; @xcite ) to fit the spectrum with a raymond - smith thermal plasma emission model suffering intervening absorption .",
    "based on the inferred nebular color excess of @xmath33 @xcite , we fixed the absorbing column at @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "the best fit indicates a plasma temperature of @xmath36 k , with an uncertainty of @xmath37% .",
    "the model fit is marginally improved by the inclusion of a gaussian component at an energy @xmath38 kev , which is suggestive of the presence of excess o vii emission .",
    "the inclusion of this second component would imply a somewhat higher plasma temperature ( @xmath39 k ) .",
    "the modeling indicates an unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath40 ergs @xmath35 s@xmath1 ( the mean of the flux from plasma components obtained by fits with and without the 0.5 kev gaussian component ) , corresponding to an intrinsic x - ray luminosity @xmath41 ergs s@xmath1 where @xmath42 is the distance to ngc 40 .",
    "the estimate @xmath43 kpc was determined by @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : hen2 - 99imgs ] we present anglo - australian observatory digitized sky survey short r - band and 2mass j- and k - band images of hen 2 - 99 along with the broad - band ( 0.310 kev ) chandra / acis x - ray image ( raw and smoothed ) of the same region .",
    "the object appears as a @xmath44 diameter nebula in the r - band image , while only the central star is detected in the near - infrared image .",
    "point - like x - ray sources in the immediate vicinity of hen 2 - 99  including one source that lies @xmath45 from the central star and has no optical or near - infrared counterpart  have similar and relatively hard spectra , and are most likely background sources .",
    "we searched for diffuse emission from hen 2 - 99 via the same approach used for ngc 40 , i.e. , we extracted a 0.310 kev spectrum from the region of the chandra / acis image encompassing the r - band emission from hen 2 - 99 .",
    "the spectral extraction avoided the point source that lies closest to the position of the central star . upon subtraction of background emission within a region defined by a circle with radius @xmath46 ,",
    "the resulting x - ray spectrum ( not shown ) reveals no source photons .    from the @xmath47 uncertainty in the background count rate (",
    "@xmath48 counts s@xmath1 ) we find a ( 3 @xmath49 ) upper limit on the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath50 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the estimate @xmath51 kpc was determined by @xcite . for this upper limit , we ( conservatively ) assume an x - ray emission temperature at the upper end of the range determined thus far for the diffuse emission from pns ( @xmath52 k ) , and adopt @xmath53 @xmath35 based on a color excess of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the shell - like shape of the x - ray emitting region in ngc 40 , and the correspondence of this region to the bright optical / near - ir rim in this nebula , indicates that the bright rim has been generated by the shocked fast wind from the central star .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission associated with the apparent `` blowouts '' ( interruptions in the rim ) that are aligned along an axis running nne - ssw in ngc 40 further suggests that this wind is more or less spherically symmetric , with a possible enhancement along the equatorial plane of the system rather than along the polar axis .",
    "we note that there is no kinematic evidence for the presence of collimated jets in ngc 40 , despite the appearance of polar `` blowouts '' and jet - like features in this nebula @xcite .",
    "the x - ray morphology of ngc 40 appears similar to ( but is better resolved than ) those of bd + 30@xmath253639 @xcite and ngc 7009 @xcite .",
    "the appearances of these structures are fully consistent with the generation of `` hot bubbles '' via wind - wind interactions @xcite .",
    "these x - ray morphologies stand in sharp contrast to the radially directed x - ray structures within the young planetary nebulae ngc 7027 and mz 3 , however . these two pns display x - ray evidence for the action of collimated jets @xcite and , in both cases , the x - ray emission appears intimately associated with the ongoing structural changes apparent in the optical / near - infrared nebulae .",
    "thus it appears that two quite different processes  jets on the one hand , and quasi - spherical fast winds on the other  may be responsible for energetic shocks and , hence , high - temperature plasma in pns ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear , furthermore , that the different processes responsible for x - ray emission are closely tied to the different pn shapes that are seen in optical emission lines .",
    "the inferred x - ray temperature and luminosity of ngc 40 ( @xmath4 k and @xmath55 ergs s@xmath1 , respectively ;  2.1 ) are the lowest measured thus far for any pn @xcite , and the radii of the bright rim and x - ray emitting shell in ngc 40 are @xmath56 times larger than these same structures in bd + 30@xmath253639 . in light of the similarity of the properties of the central stars of ngc 40 and bd",
    "+ 30@xmath253639 , the comparison between physical sizes and x - ray emission properties indicates that the former pn might best be considered as an evolved version of the latter .",
    "this interpretation places constraints on [ wc ] pn evolutionary schemes wherein the central stars evolve from late to early [ wc ] spectral types ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "specifically , given the subtle differences between the central star spectral types ( [ wc9 ] and [ wc8 ] , respectively ) and wind properties of ngc 40 and bd + 30@xmath253639 @xcite , the contrast in their x - ray and optical / near - infrared properties indicates that [ wcl ] stars and their associated pns may evolve between subclasses on timescales @xmath57 yr , i.e. , a time period shorter than the approximate dynamical age of the hot bubble in ngc 40 @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that the notion that [ wc ] pn central stars evolve from late to early subtypes remains the subject of debate @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on x - ray luminosity that we obtain for hen 2 - 99 ( @xmath58 ergs s@xmath1 ;  2.2 ) constrains this nebula to be less x - ray luminous than all pns thus far detected in x - rays @xcite with the exception of ngc 40 ( this paper ) .",
    "the nondetection of hen 2 - 99 by cxo therefore would suggest either that the fast wind from the central ( [ wc9 ] ) star has yet to collide with the ionized ejecta seen in optical images , or that any diffuse x - ray emission emanating from shocks produced by its fast wind has now faded to a level similar to or less than that detected in ngc 40 .",
    "the former interpretation would appear to be more consistent with the lack of a clearly defined inner rim in hen 2 - 99 in near - infrared images ( fig .",
    "5 ) , if the presence of such limb - brightened bubble structures in optical / near - infrared images of pns is interpreted as evidence of wind - wind shocks .",
    "additional x - ray observations of [ wc ] pns with and without well - formed optical / near - infrared bubbles are required to test the hypothesis that the lack of detectable x - ray emission from hen 2 - 99 indicates that this pn has yet to enter a phase of strong wind - wind shocks , despite the very large wind momentum of its central star .",
