    "myxobacteria are rod - shaped gram - negative bacteria , components of soil , that move by gliding in the direction of their long axis on solid surfaces , either as individuals or in swarms @xcite .",
    "this type of motility of _ m. xanthus _ cells is controlled by two different motors concentrated at the cell poles : the a - motility system ( adventurous ) specific for individual cell motion and the s - motility system ( social ) , for group cell motion .",
    "the a - engine is a ` pusher ' and works by secretion and hydration of slime , a polyelectrolyte gel , whereas the s - engine is a ` puller ' and operates through extension and retraction of type iv pili @xcite .    when nutrients are abundant , myxobacteria aggregate into multicellular swarms and spread outwards from the border of the colony .",
    "however they respond to starvation conditions by reversing their directions , moving towards the colony center and forming a multicellular fruiting body with nonmotile spores .",
    "spores can survive for long periods of time and , under adequate conditions , germinate giving rise to motile vegetative cells @xcite .",
    "fruiting body formation is a multi - step process of alignment , rippling , streaming , and aggregation @xcite .",
    "overall models of the myxobacteria life cycle depending on food availability can be found in @xcite . before aggregation begins , bacterial collective behavior and intercellular communication create fascinating collective concentric and spiral traveling waves called _",
    "ripples_. during the rippling phase , bacteria move in concert in such a way that colliding waves appear to pass through one another .",
    "the resulting periodic patterns consist of equally spaced ridges of high cell density that appear to advance through the bacterial population as rhythmically traveling waves moving in opposite directions . in these counter - propagating waves ,",
    "individual cells are parallel to the direction of the ripples , move back and forth and exchange developmental signals ( c - signals ) only when they collide @xcite .",
    "most experimentally observed rippling patterns can be characterized as counter - propagating traveling waves @xcite . unlike waves generated by reaction - diffusion instabilities , which annihilate on collision , myxobacteria waves appear to pass through one another unaffected and are therefore analogous to solitons @xcite .",
    "there are discrete @xcite and continuum @xcite theoretical models of cell behavior and cell - to - cell interaction based on c - signaling .",
    "intercellular communication is by direct cell contact , without any diffusible morphogen signaling .",
    "cells migrating in opposite directions can come into contact with each other ( collide ) and exchange c - signals .",
    "cell state changes periodically so that isolated cells reverse periodically their motion .",
    "these changes can be modeled by the concept of an internal clock @xcite .",
    "the internal clock or pacemaker regulates swarming that is driven by growth @xcite . in some models rippling",
    "can not occur unless there is a refractory period after cell reversal during which a cell does not respond to c - signals from other cells and does not reverse @xcite .",
    "rippling may occur even without a refractory phase in generalized discrete models if the interaction strength and the degree of cooperativity are large enough @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider igoshin et al s continuum one - dimensional ( 1d ) model for rippling @xcite , solve it numerically and interpret the results by a study of the small nonlinearity limit .",
    "an extension of this model to 2d can be found in @xcite and related agent - based models in @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that numerical solutions of the continuum model exhibit rippling @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the analysis of the small nonlinearity limit does not provide a selection rule for the observed wavelength of ripples @xcite .",
    "in contrast with these results , we show that the small nonlinearity limit does provide a description of the rippling instability and it supplies the critical wavenumber of the periodic patterns in terms of the refractory period .",
    "in fact , careful consideration of flux continuity at the different stages of one cycle of the internal clock of myxobacteria shows that the limiting equation for the cell density is of fokker - planck type but it contains an additional source term .",
    "the extra source term is the cell density times a nonlocal growth rate that vanishes as the refractory period tends to zero .",
    "the source term is key new element in our analysis , as it produces dissipation even in the absence of diffusion .",
    "thus the role of the source term is similar to that of collision terms in the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "the balance between advection in space and time and dissipation due to the `` collision term '' selects the wavelength of the rippling patterns that issue forth from the uniform stationary state .",
    "these patterns are periodic in time and space .",
    "numerical solutions of the full model equations show that the pattern frequency decreases as the strength of the nonlinearity increases .",
    "it is interesting to contrast the behavior of the present myxobacteria model with the well - known synchronization of globally coupled phase oscillators described by the kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "the kuramoto oscillators move on a circle with their own random natural frequency and their mutual interaction through a mean field tends to synchronize them . partial or complete synchronization is achieved for sufficiently strong coupling through a nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "igoshin et al s model describes phase oscillators with an internal clock whose angular speed changes according to their interaction with oppositely moving oscillators .",
    "since the igoshin oscillators move with a constant positive or negative velocity , patterns arising from appropriate initial conditions persist in the absence of interaction . in this case ,",
    "mean - field interaction among oscillators may produce loss of rhythmicity resulting in the destruction of patterns .",
    "this change appears as a nonequilibrium phase transition at critical values of parameters that has been explicitly shown in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe igoshin et al s continuum model @xcite in section [ sec:2 ] and write the corresponding equations in nondimensional form .",
    "the weak signaling limit is examined in section [ sec:3 ] , where the limiting fokker - planck type equation with source term is derived .",
    "the linear stability of its uniform stationary solution is analyzed in section [ sec:4 ] . in the absence of diffusion and for disturbances with frequency one",
    "( same as that of the signaling solution without nonlinear terms ) , we find that rippling patterns appear for disturbances with wavenumber less than one , whatever the refractory period .",
    "increasing the wavenumber @xmath0 may result in the cancellation of patterns , as the uniform stationary solution becomes linearly stable . since diffusion has a stabilizing role for the uniform solution ( producing a negative term proportional to @xmath1 in the real part of eigenvalues )",
    ", unavoidable numerical noise should tend to annihilate the periodic patterns and be more effective as @xmath0 increases .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] contains the results of numerical solutions of the full model equations .",
    "the findings of the linear stability analysis and the wavenumber selection criteria are confirmed .",
    "in addition , we observe a rich variety of stable periodic patterns comprising standing and traveling waves as numerical solutions of the model equations for moderate and strong signaling between cells .",
    "section [ sec:6 ] contrasts our findings with the behavior of the kuramoto model for the synchronization of phase oscillators .",
    "the last section contains our conclusions .",
    "when starving , myxobacteria aggregate and form a fruiting body and eventually a spore . before aggregation begins , there appear periodic patterns of equally spaced high density bands that move as traveling waves ( ripples ) .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model for ripples of igoshin et al @xcite is based on the following experimental observations :    - _ internal biochemical clock _ : cells are aligned parallel and glide along their long axis in one direction during part of their internal period and glide in the opposite direction during the other part of their period .",
    "- _ contact signaling _ : a cell collides with an oppositely moving cell and interchanges a signal ( a c - protein ) . as a result , both cells reverse their motion .",
    "the collision frequency depends on the local cell density .",
    "- _ refractory period _ : after one collision there is a refractory period during which the cell does not reverse its motion even if it collides again .",
    "let @xmath2 be the number density of bacteria per unit length @xmath3 and per unit internal phase @xmath4 .",
    "cells with @xmath5 move to the right with velocity @xmath6 and cells with @xmath7 move to the left ( velocity @xmath8 ) .",
    "cell division and death are negligible during the rippling phase .",
    "the governing equation is as follows : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a space diffusivity , the density @xmath2 is a @xmath11-periodic function of @xmath4 and it satisfies periodic boundary conditions at @xmath12 or it decays to zero if @xmath13 . to model the angular flux @xmath14 , we make precise the above experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the cell velocity is given by ( [ eq2 ] ) and reversals occur at @xmath15 . the internal clock of a bacterium advances with constant angular velocity @xmath16 but when the cell collides with another one moving in the opposite direction , both cells exchange a signal .",
    "the collision frequency , and therefore the signaling intensity , is proportional to the local cell density .",
    "the cells may respond positively to this signal by accelerating their angular speed from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( see below ) depending on their internal phase .",
    "the coefficient @xmath18 measures the relative change in angular velocity from that during the refractory period , @xmath16 , to the bacterium velocity during the signaling period , thereby characterizing signaling strength .",
    "after each reversal ( at @xmath19 ) , the cell enters a refractory period during which does not respond to collision signaling and does not reverse . if @xmath20 is the angular duration of the refractory period , the angular flux is @xmath21 for @xmath22 and for @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "<S> bacteria in this model are phase oscillators with an extra internal phase through which they are coupled to a mean - field of oppositely moving bacteria . </S>",
    "<S> previously , patterns for this model were obtained only by numerical methods and it was not possible to find their wavenumber analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an evolution equation for the reversal point density that selects the pattern wavenumber in the weak signaling limit , show the validity of the selection rule by solving numerically the model equations and describe other stable patterns in the strong signaling limit . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal mean - field coupling tends to decohere and confine patterns . under appropriate circumstances </S>",
    "<S> , it can annihilate the patterns leaving a constant density state via a nonequilibrium phase transition reminiscent of destruction of synchronization in the kuramoto model . </S>"
