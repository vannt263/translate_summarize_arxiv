    "observations of the anisotropy and polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide a unique information about the primordial inhomogeneity of the universe . since detection by cobe ( smoot et",
    "al , 1992 , bennett et al , 1996 ) of the cmb anisotropy several groups have reported on high angular resolution observational data at the angular scales @xmath0 in the vicinity of the so called doppler peak in the @xmath1 power spectrum ( hancock , et al , 1994 ; gundersen , 1993 ; de bernarais , et al . , 1994 ; masi , et al , 1996 ; tanaka , et al . , 1995 ; cheng , et al .",

    "determination of the spectrum of the primordial anisotropy on scales @xmath2 will yield valuable clues to the formation of the large scale structure of the universe and the most important parameters of the universe : the total and baryonic densities at the present time ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) ; the hubble constant , ionization history etc .",
    "however , the interpretation of these experimental results as well as the comparison with the expected power spectra of anisotropy in different cosmological models is complicated .",
    "future experiments ( map and planck ) will construct the map of the cmb with high level of resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the temperature distribution in the sky also contains the information beyond power spectrum .",
    "gaussianity of the primordial signal is well motivated by the inflationary cosmology and has been adopted by many authors ( see for review starobinsky 1982 , bardeen et al .",
    "1983 , bardeen et al . 1986 ) . in this case",
    "the distribution of the cmb temperature in the sky is in the form of the two - dimensional scalar random gaussian field .",
    "this field can be completely characterized by its power spectrum .",
    "many authors proposed to calculate various statistical characteristics of the cmb anisotropy as tests of gaussianity .",
    "all these techniques provide information beyond power spectrum :    \\1 .",
    "statistic of peaks in a random gaussian fields .",
    "following classical papers of doroshkevich 1970 and bardeen , j.m.,bond , j.r.,kaiser , n.,@xmath5 szalay , 1986 - ( bbks ) ) , this approach has been developed by ( bond and efstathiou 1987 , p.coles 1988 ) for cmb anisotropy .",

    ", minkowski functionals are very sensitive to non - gaussianity .",
    "this approach is very effective because these functionals are additive with respect to the isolated regions in the sky and they have simple analytical form in the case of the gaussian field .",
    "this approach can be used to test predictions of gaussianity .",
    "percolation and cluster analysis .",
    "this statistical method based on a very attractive idea : if the experimental signal is a sum of the primordial signal and non - gaussian noise ( for example foreground sources , dust emission and so on ) , then statistical properties of the pure gaussian signal could be distorted .",
    "this effect provides a basis for the investigation of the characteristics of the non - gaussian noise in the experimental data .",
    "note , that percolation has become a popular term among cosmologists .",
    "the percolation technique has been successfully applied for investigation of the evolution of the spatial density distribution in the universe due to gravitational instability ( see for review zeldovich 1982 , shandarin 1983 , dominik , @xmath5 shandarin 1992 ) . for cmb",
    "anisotropy this technique has been developed by ( naselsky and novikov d. 1995 , novikov d. and jorgensen 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the data analysis of the cmb anisotropy can be divided into two parts : power spectrum estimation with subsequent cosmological parameters extraction , and investigation of the nature of the observed signal .",
    "there is another important characteristic of the distribution of the cmb on the sky : this is the cmb polarization .",
    "the idea that polarization provides important information about the primordial cosmic plasma was pointed out by rees ( 1968 ) .",
    "the properties of the power spectrum of the cmb polarization field were analyzed in for example ( basco and polnarev 1979 , polnarev 1985 , bond and efstathiou 1987 , coulson et al .",

    "the polarization field also contains information beyond power spectrum which also can be used for investigation of the nature of the primordial inhomogeneity in the universe .",
    "statistical properties of the polarization field caused by gaussian fluctuations was partly discussed by bond and efstathiou 1987 , arbuzov et al .",
    "1997a , arbuzov et al .",
    "it is important to note , that polarization contains more information about nature of the primordial signal than the anisotropy ( the polarization field is a combination of two random independent gaussian fields ( bond and efstathiou 1987 , while anisotropy of the cmb is only one ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus attention on the general statistical properties of the cmb polarization field .",
    "this is not a scalar field ( unlike the anisotropy ) and can be completely described in terms of stokes parameters - @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . since thomson scattering does not produce circular polarization , @xmath9 we can consider the level of polarization , which depends only on two parameters - @xmath10 , where i is the total intensity , and @xmath11 is the polarized intensity . therefore , polarization field can be described in terms of the angle of polarization @xmath12arctg@xmath13 and polarized intensity - p. since polarization of the radiation does not have any direction ( it has only the orientation @xmath14 and intensity p ) , it can not be formally interpreted as a vector field .",
    "nevertheless , below we use the term `` vector of polarization '' @xmath15 ( so that @xmath16 ) for simplicity , taking into account that this `` vector '' is not directed .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of the autocorrelated pseudo - vector @xmath15 are statistically independent ( bond and efstathiou 1987 ) and have a gaussian distribution on the sky .",
    "we are interested in the general statistical properties of the @xmath15 distribution such as surface density and classification of the non - polarized points @xmath17 in the sky , minkowski functionals for the value of @xmath18 and the percolation of the relatively strongly polarized spots .",
    "in this section we discuss very specific features of the polarization pattern of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "all results were obtained under the assumption that the polarization field is the result of a random gaussian process .",
    "we describe the statistical properties of the two dimensional vector field of the polarization @xmath15 such as the surface density of the singular points @xmath19 ( section 2.1 ) , genus curve for the two dimensional scalar field @xmath20 and the level of percolation through the relatively strongly polarized spots ( section 2.2 ) . in this section",
    "we consider small angular parts of the sky without loss of generality .",
    "thus the geometry is approximately flat and the vector of polarization can be described in the following form :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the unit vectors of the cartesian coordinate system on the small angular part of the unit sphere and components @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of stokes parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 :    @xmath26    where @xmath14 is the orientation of polarization and :    @xmath27    therefore , components @xmath24 and @xmath25 are also independent random two - dimensional gaussian fields with the same parameters as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it means , that the statistical properties of the vector @xmath28 are equivalent to the properties of the vector @xmath15 .",
    "it allows us to use the usual terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 instead of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "first , we are interested in the statistics of the singular points @xmath29 of the vector @xmath15 : @xmath30 .",
    "this condition means , that both components @xmath6 and @xmath7 are equal to zero in such points simultaneously : @xmath31 the surface density of these points can easily be computed analytically .",
    "points @xmath29 are the points of the intersection of the lines of zero level of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 surfaces . the angular density of such points can be found by using the properties of the joint probability function for distribution of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the first derivatives of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively in the point @xmath29 : @xmath38 these 6 different values are independent ( bardeen et al . 1986 ) for an arbitrary point @xmath39 of the map and have zero average and the following variances : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the spectral parameters , as they were defined by bond and efstaphiou 1987 .",
    "the joint probability for these values is : @xmath43 @xmath44 in the vicinity of the singular point ( @xmath45 ) , the value of @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be described by the following expression : @xmath46 the substitution of @xmath47 and integration over @xmath48 gives us the number density of the singular points : @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the analytical calculation of the surfase density of the singular points can be found in appendix a. here we present the main results and conclusions only .",
    "* a. classification of singular points *    we investigate the polarization vector field around the singular points in the following way .",
    "let us imagine that a point in the vicinity of the singular point is moving along the lines of the vector field .",
    "in this case the investigation is similar to that for the singular points of linear differential equations . following eq.(5 ) the field in the small vicinity of the point @xmath29 , where @xmath51 can be described in terms of the matrix @xmath52 of first derivatives of the field @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 , and we can consider the following equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 the characteristic equation for eq.(10 ) is : @xmath59 this equation has two roots : @xmath60 and @xmath61 , ordered by @xmath62 , and the classification of the singular point @xmath29 depends on their values .",
    "if @xmath63 , then this is a focus and the vector field will spiral toward the point @xmath29 ( fig.1 left ) .",
    "+ 2 . if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are real , then the matrix @xmath52 has two eigenvectors which correspond to different values @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and we can consider two different cases :    .",
    "@xmath64 - both values are positive or @xmath65 - both values are negative .",
    "this means , that the point @xmath29 is a knot and the lines of the vector field tend to be aligned to the direction of the eigenvector with maximal value of @xmath66 , @xmath50 ( fig.1 middle ) .    .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 - values with opposite signs . in this case",

    "*    detailed calculation of the surfase density of the singular points is in the appendix a. the surface density of singular points of different kinds are : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the number densities of focuses , knots and saddles respectively and @xmath73 is the correlation radius .",
    "the total number density of non - polarized points is : @xmath74 density of the singular points depends essentially on correlation radius ( eq .",
    "12 , 13 ) and therefore on the spectral parameters @xmath75 , @xmath42 .",
    "these spectral parameters depend on the spectra of polarization and on the device resolution ( bond and efstathiou , 1987 ) ( see also fig.3 ) .",
    "the ratios @xmath76 are the spectral independent constants determined only by the gaussian nature of the primordial inhomogeneity in the universe .",
    "these ratios are a characteristic feature of the cmb polarization vector field in the inflationary cosmology .",
    "note , that for example in the two - dimensional potential vector field ( @xmath77 ) the number density of foci is equal to zero since this field does not have a rotational component .",
    "the joint probability for the distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the singular points which can be either knots or saddles ( not foci ) is : @xmath78 note , that this distribution is universal for all kinds of spectra of polarization as well as ratios ( 15 ) .      here",
    "we present our results for the genus statistics of the value @xmath79 .",
    "we can divide the map of polarization of the cmb into two parts : regions with relatively strong polarization @xmath80 ( `` strongly polarized zones '' ) and regions with relatively weak polarization @xmath81 ( `` weakly polarized zones '' ) .",

    "if we can measure only `` strongly polarized '' signal - @xmath85 , then we can see only the separated polarized spots which do not percolate .",
    "therefore , the percolation trough polarized zones can be reached only by the device with the sensitivity @xmath86 .    the value @xmath82 can be found analytically in the following way .",
    "we consider the value @xmath20 as a two - dimensional random scalar field with a rayleigh distribution ( coles and barrow , 1987 ) .",
    "this field can be imagined as a two - dimensional surface in a three - dimensional space .",
    "this surface has extreme points such as maxima , minima , saddle points and singular points .",
    "the last ones have been considered in the previous subsection .",
    "the densities of maxima , minima and saddle points have some distributions with @xmath87 : @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 - are the number densities of maxima , minima and saddle points respectively on some interval - ( p , p+dp ) , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 are the number densities of maxima , minima and saddle points respectively above some level @xmath87 .",
    "( we note , that here saddle points are the saddle points of the two - dimensional surfase of p(x , y ) .",
    "these points are not the same as saddle ( kind of singular points ) in the previous section . )",
    "+ the definition of the genus is : @xmath95 the integrated genus is then : @xmath96 the level of percolation @xmath82 has to be found from the condition @xmath97 .",
    "we recognize that this condition does not automatically mean that @xmath82 is the level of percolation for an arbitrary scalar field .",
    "it is well - known that for the gaussian random field the percolation level corresponds to the level where genus curve intersects the zero .",
    "we have checked this condition for the rayleigh distribution by simulating a large number of realizations for a two - dimensional field . in the case of rayleigh distribution",
    "this condition also mean that level @xmath82 corresponds to the percolation contour .",
    "the detailed calculation of the genus can be found in appendix b. formally the steps of its calculation are as follows : + 1 .",

    "these values obey the following conditions : @xmath105    \\2 .",
    "the joint probability f of the gaussian distribution for the values @xmath53 , @xmath98 , @xmath100 , @xmath54 , @xmath106 , @xmath101 is : @xmath107 where @xmath52 is the covariance matrix and a is the quadratic form of the 12-dimensional vector @xmath108 .",
    "the substitution of @xmath87 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 in eq.(20 ) from eq.(19 ) and integration over 6 variables gives us the joint probability @xmath111 for values @xmath87 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 to be in the range from @xmath87 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 to @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",

    "the non - smooth minima have not been taken into account in eqs.(16)-(25 ) .",

    "therefore the total number of extreme points per unit area are : @xmath134 taking into account equations ( 13,18,25,27 ) we obtain : @xmath135 as it should be .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the cmb polarization at any point of the map can be characterized by the orientation angle and polarized intensity - p. this intensity has the random rayleigh distribution on the sky - @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath87 can be considered as a two - dimensional random raleigh field .",
    "it is well - known , that two - dimensional field has only three minkowski functionals which satisfy additivity and translational invariance ( minkowski 1903 , hadwiger 1959 ) .    geometrical interpretation of the minkowsky functionals on the two - dimensional map is essentially easy .",
    "analogously to the previous section , we consider polarized intensity as a two - dimensional surface in a three - dimensional space .",
    "if we cut this surface at the different levels @xmath84 , then the area of the map will be divided into two parts : the area , where polarization is above the threshold @xmath84 and the area , where @xmath137 .",
    "for a two - dimensional distribution , minkowski functionals correspond to the following values : + 1 .",
    "a - fraction of the area of the map , where @xmath138 ; + 2 .",

    "the third functional has already been considered in the previous section .",
    "the obvious first one is @xmath140 .",
    "the second one can be obtained in the same way as it was done for the the gaussian field ( adler 1981 ) . here",
    "we present the result without derivation :    @xmath141    the comparison of the minkowski functionals for the cmb polarization field with these functionals for cmb anisotropy is in the fig .",
    "functionals for rayleigh distribution are equal to zero for @xmath142",
    ". the third functional should be described together with the number of non - polarized points ( see previous section ) .",
    "these functionals can be used as a morphological descriptor of the cmb polarization field in a similar manner as for the cmb anizotropy ( winitski and kosowski 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented calculations of the statistical properties cmb polarization maps .",
    "we believe that these statistical properties can be useful for checking the polarization patterns for presence of the non - gaussian noise ( for example , confusion signal from sources which can have the same spectral parameters as the polarization of the cmb )",
    ". if an observational signal is free from non - gaussian noise and is gaussian itself ( due to inflation ) then the topological approach is not necessary , because the correlation function or equivalent its power spectrum contains all information about the polarization signal .",
    "on the other hand , if the signal is a sum of polarization of the cmb ( which is gaussian ) and unresolved foreground sources ( which are non - gaussian ) , then a detailed topological picture of the polarization field around the non - polarization points will be distorted comparative the predictions of the theory for the gaussian distributions .    on the other hand ,",
    "the investigation of the nature of the primordial polarized signal is a test of the inflationary model of the evolution of the universe .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the minkowski functionals together with the non - polarized points on the observational data and comparison with the theoretical predictions can be used as the test on gaussianity of the primordial inhomogeneity .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the regions with strong polarization will be detected easier than the regions with weak polarization . as we demonstrated in the paper ( see section 2.2 ) these region occupy an essential part of a whole map . from this point of view",
    "it is interesting to study the statistical properties of these regions .",
    "it is worth also mentioning that it is interesting to investigate the dependence of the spectral parameters of polarization in various cosmological models on the resolution of the detector and related statistical properties of the maps of polarization of the cmb .",
    "it is also very interesting to stady the cross - correlations between anisotropy and polarization on the sky map and make some theoretical predictions from the geometrical point of view .",

    "<S> the distribution of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the sky is determined by the hypothesis of random gaussian distribution of the primordial density perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> this hypotheses is well motivated by the inflationary cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the test of consistency of the statistical properties of the cmb polarization field with the gaussianity of primordial density fluctuations is a realistic way to study the nature of primordial inhomogeneities in the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper contains the theoretical predictions of the general statistical properties of the cmb polarization field . </S>",
    "<S> all results obtained under assumption of the gaussian nature of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> we pay the special attention to the following two problems . </S>",
    "<S> first , the classification and statistics of the singular points of the polarization field where polarization is equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> second , the topology of contours of the value of the degree of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the percolation properties for the zones of `` strong '' and `` weak '' polarization . we also have calculated minkowski functionals for the cmb polarization field . </S>",
    "<S> all results are analytical .    _ </S>",
    "<S> subject headings : _ cosmic microwave background , cosmology , statistics , observations . </S>"
