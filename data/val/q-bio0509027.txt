    "universality classes with long - range correlations are a hallmark of systems with many degrees of freedom throughout physics . in equilibrium condensed matter systems , they mark critical points or phases with a particular symmetry . out of equilibrium ,",
    "power - law correlations are more generic but the classification of universality classes becomes more difficult .",
    "well known examples are surface growth , reaction - diffusion systems , and self - organized criticality .    a striking example of long - range correlations in a biological system has been found in the base pair composition of genomic dna more than a decade ago  @xcite . since then",
    ", the composition correlations of dna have been studied extensively by a variety of different methods , and nowadays it is well established that long - range correlations appear in the genomes of many species  @xcite .",
    "the form of these correlations , however , is much more complex than simple power - laws . within one chromosome",
    ", there is often a variety of different scaling regimes and effective exponents , and sometimes no clear scaling at all .    despite the ubiquity of long - range correlations in genomes , little",
    "is known about their origin .",
    "a likely dynamical scenario is that they are generated by the stochastic processes of molecular sequence evolution . in  @xcite",
    ", we have studied a minimal evolutionary dynamics producing long - range correlations that can be compared to dna sequence data in a quantitative way .",
    "this dynamics incorporates _ local _ processes including single site mutations , duplications and deletions of existing segments of the sequence , and insertions of random segments .",
    "it is inspired by a model introduced by li in 1989  @xcite .",
    "we have proved the emergence of long - range correlations in this dynamics : the correlation function of the generated sequences decays as @xmath1 for large @xmath2 , and we have obtained an exact expression for the decay exponent @xmath3 .    in the first part of this article ( sections  [ definition]-[finite_size_distribution ] ) , we present a more detailed calculation of the expectation value of the two - point correlation function and the finite - size distribution function of the sequence composition bias .",
    "we show that these quantities exhibit consistent scaling and that their functional forms are given mathematically as solutions of simple differential equations .",
    "the resulting power - law behavior can be expressed in terms of a single basic exponent @xmath0 , the scaling dimension of the local composition bias .",
    "this exponent is determined by just two effective parameters , which are simple functions of the rates of the elementary processes . as a function of @xmath0 ,",
    "we find two distinct scaling regimes . in the strong - correlation regime ( @xmath4 )",
    ", the ancestral composition bias can be detected in arbitrarily long sequences , in the weak - correlation regime ( @xmath5 , this is possible only up to a characteristic sequence length .    in the second part of the article ( sections  [ model_extensions ] and  [ dynamical_correlations ] ) , we analyze various generalizations of the sequence evolution model introduced in  @xcite and demonstrate that they form a consistent universality class of non - equilibrium processes with generic long - range correlations .",
    "these processes are biased segmental insertions as well as mutations with biased rates , which break the @xmath6 symmetry of the original model .",
    "the purpose of this generalization is two - fold . on the one hand ,",
    "the extended model is biologically more accurate , since there is strong evidence for the presence of gc - content biased segmental insertion processes  @xcite , as well as biased mutation rates  @xcite during evolutionary history .",
    "taking into account these processes proves crucial for practical data analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the model conceptually delineates what are the essential ingredients of this non - equilibrium universality class : long - range correlations emerge from the interplay of processes producing correlations on short scales , exponential growth of sequence length , and local randomization processes .",
    "the universal scaling behavior is distinguished from the symmetry breaking caused by biased mutation processes .",
    "furthermore , we generalize the scaling picture to dynamical aspects of the build - up and decay of correlations in time .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the role of universality in a biological context .",
    "the stochastic evolution model generates sequences @xmath7 of variable length @xmath8 . for simplicity ,",
    "their letters are taken from a binary alphabet ; @xmath9 .",
    "the elementary evolutionary steps are single site mutations , duplications and deletions of existing sequence segments of arbitrary lengths , and insertion of random segments .",
    "in fact , these processes are assumed to be the major local processes acting on genomic dna sequences during evolutionary history  @xcite .",
    "formally , the dynamics of the processes can be defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes an existing sequence segment of length @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a segment of length @xmath14 with uniformly distributed random letters @xmath15 .",
    "note that by convention we do not allow insertion of random segments prior to the first sequence element .",
    "duplication and insertion events introduce a new sequence segment next to an existing one and shift all subsequent letters @xmath14 positions to the right , thereby increasing the sequence length by  @xmath14 .",
    "conversely , deletions shorten the length by  @xmath14 .",
    "we will restrict all processes to a maximum range @xmath16 , i.e. , all rates @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are zero for @xmath20 . repeatedly running the processes over a time @xmath21 produces a statistical ensemble of sequences ; the corresponding averages are denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "this ensemble is characterized by the rates of the processes and by the initial sequence .",

    "however , @xmath243 for all @xmath2 , is also a stationary solution of equation  ( [ c_continuum ] ) .",
    "hence , in order for long - range correlations to be established , a third necessary feature of such systems is the presence of a mechanism continuously producing correlations on short scales .",
    "they serve as an ongoing reservoir for the transport of correlations to larger sequence distances and ensure the existence of a non - zero value @xmath244 for a specific @xmath245 ( in our model , these initial correlations on short - scales are produced by duplications ) . as an intuitive example for the necessity of this third condition , consider an expansion - randomization system with mutations and insertions of single random letters , but no duplications .",
    "this system features exponential expansion , as well as local randomization .",
    "but the insertion process is not capable of producing @xmath246 , and therefore no long - range correlations can be established in the generated sequences .    as expected from standard scaling theory , the decay of the two - point function has twice the exponent as the corresponding decay of the one - point function .",
    "the value @xmath0 can be interpreted as the scaling dimension of the variable @xmath34 in this universality class .",
    "there is a 1-parameter family of decay exponents as , for example , in the gaussian model in two dimensions .",
