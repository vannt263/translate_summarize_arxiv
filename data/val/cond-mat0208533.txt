    "in recent years , the advances in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) made possible the manipulation of single atoms on top of a surface and the construction of quantum structures of arbitrary shape @xcite . in particular , quantum corrals have been assembled by depositing a close line of atoms or molecules on cu or noble metal ( 111 ) surfaces @xcite .",
    "these surfaces have the property that for small wave vectors parallel to the surface a parabolic band of two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface states uncoupled to bulk states exists @xcite .",
    "a circular corral of radius @xmath10   was constructed depositing 48 fe atoms on a cu(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "the measured differential conductance @xmath11 could be fitted by a combination of the density of eigenstates close to the fermi energy @xmath12 , of a 2d electron gas inside a hard wall circular corral @xcite . on another experiment ,",
    "a co atom acting as a magnetic impurity was placed at one focus of an elliptical quantum corral , and the corresponding kondo feature in @xmath11 was observed not only at that position , but also with reduced intensity at the other focus @xcite .",
    " _ mirage _  _ can be understood as the result of quantum interference in the way in which the kondo effect is transmitted from one focus to the other by the different conduction eigenstates of a hard - wall ellipse @xcite . among these eigenstates ,",
    "the density of the one closest to @xmath12 is clearly displayed in the change of differential conductance @xmath9 after adding the impurity @xcite .",
    "more recently , the extrema in the degenerate @xmath13 and @xmath14 conduction eigenstates of a hard wall circular corral have inspired an experiment with two impurities inside the corral @xcite .",
    "the theories of the mirage experiment can be classified into those which start from eigenstates of a confined 2d electron gas @xcite and those in which the confining atoms are modeled by a phenomenological scattering approach @xcite .",
    "the latter have the disadvantage that many - body effects are very hard to include .",
    "in addition , some features which are clear from the hard wall eigenstates , like mirages out of the foci @xcite , are somewhat hidden in the scattering approaches . on the other hand , while the eigenstates inside a hard wall corral are perfectly defined , in the actual experiments the boundaries of the corrals are soft and the eigenstates become resonances with finite width @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this width plays a crucial role in the line shape of @xmath9 and its magnitude at the mirage point @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is large the mirage disappears , while if @xmath15 and other parameters as in the experiment , there is no kondo resonance at @xmath12 .",
    "ordinary lanczos calculations have @xmath16 @xcite and are unable to describe the line shape of @xmath17 .",
    "this can be corrected using an embedding method @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this theory and the perturbative one @xcite using a constant value for @xmath18 as a parameter , are the only many - body ones presented so far , which can explain the voltage dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , a careful study of the broadening @xmath19 is necessary .",
    "another important parameter which is still not well known is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the part of the resonant level width of the impurity state , which is due to hybridization with bulk ( surface ) states .",
    "some theories have assumed that @xmath23 , while others have taken @xmath24 @xcite . clearly , @xmath25 , because otherwise @xmath26 would be independent of the 2d conduction eigenstates in contrast to the experiment @xcite . instead , the line shape for both , the elliptical corral and the clean surface can be explained taking @xmath27 and the same set of parameters @xcite .",
    "a recent experiment suggests that @xmath28 on the basis of the rapid decay in @xmath26 as the stm tip is moved away from the impurity @xcite .",
    "however , the 4s and 4p states of the impurity atom were not included in the analysis and they can affect the distance dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that experiments with two impurities inside a quantum corral can elucidate the magnitude of @xmath29 because the effect of interactions between impurities is expected to be proportional to @xmath30@xcite .    in this work",
    "we solve the impurity anderson model which describes the mirage experiment using perturbation theory in the coulomb repulsion @xmath8 .",
    "the previous theory of one of us @xcite is extended to include non - vanishing @xmath21 and a more realistic @xmath6 .",
    "we calculate the widths of the conduction states @xmath6 for a circular corral .",
    "we obtain an integral expression for the conduction electron green s function @xmath3 in the absence of the impurity , and then we expand it as a discrete sum of contributions from simple poles , using ideas borrowed from nuclear physics @xcite and scattering theory @xcite .",
    "this expansion takes a suitable form for the perturbative approach .",
    "we also discuss the space dependence of the compensation of the impurity spin .",
    "the calculation of @xmath3 is presented in section ii . in section iii",
    "we describe the model and the many - body approach .",
    "section iv contains the results for @xmath9 in circular and elliptical corrals with a magnetic impurity . in section",
    "v , we calculate the correlation functions between the impurity spin and that of the conduction electrons as a function of position . section vi is a discussion .",
    "starting from free electrons in 2d , we model the boundary of an empty circular corral ( without magnetic impurities inside ) by a continuous potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance to the center of the circle and @xmath2 its radius .",
    "the approximation of a continuous boundary ( instead of discrete adatoms forming the corral ) simplifies considerably the mathematics and is justified by the fact that the fermi wave length for surface electrons @xmath31   is larger than the average distance between adatoms @xmath32  .",

    "this is mainly due to the fact that the effective hybridization of the state at the fermi level is proportional to @xmath255 which is approximately @xmath221 of @xmath256 of the larger ellipse .",

[ fig7 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "as expected @xcite , the intensity at the mirage point @xmath250 , compared to the impurity point is larger in the smaller ellipse .    while the _ intensity _ of the mirage is closely related with the hybridization of the impurity with the state at @xmath12 , the _ width _ of the peak in the impurity spectral density and hence @xmath239 depends on the effective hybridization with the impurity of all conduction states .",
    "for example , if in the ellipse of the original experiments one suppresses artificially the hybridization with the main odd states 32 , 35 , and 51 , the width in @xmath200 is reduced to roughly half its value for realistic @xmath166 , while the magnitude of @xmath9 at the mirage point _ increases _ substantially , reaching almost the same magnitude as in the focus occupied by the impurity .",
    "the width in @xmath268 is less sensitive to the parameters as that of @xmath200 . as expected , this sensitivity is decreased for increasing @xmath166 .      in this section",

    "( [ goap ] ) . the resonance is broader in this case .",
    "this is due to the fact that with decreasing @xmath61 , not only the maximum in real space of the conduction density of states shifts , but also the spectral weight of the resonance at @xmath233 near this maximum decreases , leading to a smaller effective hybridization . when @xmath61 is increased so that @xmath283ev , the intensity at @xmath193 increases . also when @xmath24 is taken , increasing @xmath128 the resonances broaden by @xmath267 .",

    "this has led to the proposal @xcite that two independent and simultaneous mirages can be observed placing two impurities at the same distance from the center and forming an angle of @xmath289 degrees . while this seems in agreement with experiment , the conduction states with even @xmath34 ( which lie out of @xmath12 ) , introduce a small interaction between both channels .     as a function of position for a smaller corral ( see text ) .",

    "the kondo depression observed in the energy dependence of @xmath9 is narrower ( with a total width of @xmath297 0.008 ev for @xmath283ev and @xmath298 ) , and the intensity at the mirages is smaller . in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] and previous calculations for perfect confinement ( @xmath235 ) @xcite , the spin correlations do not recover substantially at the empty focus , although still faint features related with the conduction state at the fermi level ( @xmath344 ) are still discernible .. the ratio of the spin correlations at both foci is @xmath345 .",
    "note that from @xmath239 and @xmath305 for surface electrons in the mirage experiments , one gets @xmath346  , slightly larger than the distance between foci . as it is clear from the calculation above , for @xmath318 all conduction states ( also those at high energies )",

    "we have studied the 2d green s function for free electrons , subject to a potential that simulates a continuous circular corral .",
    "we disregarded the hybridization with bulk states at the boundary of the corral . in scattering theories ,",
    "an imaginary part is introduced for the phase shift to take into account this effect in phenomenological way @xcite , and this leads to loss of intensity at the mirage point when an impurity is introduced in the corral . in our theory",
    "this loss of intensity comes as a result of quantum interference , as explained in section iv .",
    "although the density of states is continuous in space and energy , the energy dependence of the green s function at low energies can be written as a sum of discrete poles , representing resonant states .",
    "this property is expected to persist for more realistic potentials which might include hybridization with bulk states or individual atoms at the boundary at the corral @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a width @xmath6 of each resonance is the main difference with a calculation assuming a hard wall corral .",
    "the energies @xmath347 and the space dependence of the density of states inside corral are well described by the calculation assuming hard walls , but the magnitude of the latter is somewhat overestimated .",

    "we must warn however that at least above the fermi energy , the surface states have an intrinsic width , even in absence of the corral @xcite .",
    "thus , while we expect that @xmath348 can be reduced for example by depositing a second line of atoms at the boundary of the corral , there are probably intrinsic limits to this reduction .",
    "another shortcoming of our one - body calculation is that actually the effective mass depends on energy .",
    "photoemission experiments suggest a flattening of the dispersion above @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this is also apparent in the comparison of experimental energy levels for a circular corral an those of a hard wall calculation @xcite and persists in our results for soft boundaries .",
    "the expansion as a sum of discrete poles of the conduction electron green s function is a convenient starting point for a perturbative treatment of the anderson model that describes the physics when a magnetic impurity is introduced inside the corral .",
    "the line shape of the change in differential conductance @xmath9 and the relative intensity at points distant from the impurity ( where a `` mirage '' of the impurity is observed @xcite ) is very sensitive to @xmath6 .",
    "this sensitivity is reduced but persists if an important intrinsic width @xmath21 of the impurity level due to direct hybridization with bulk states is introduced . a smaller @xmath6 leads to a stronger intensity at the mirage point , and",
    "the space dependence tends to that of the conduction state at @xmath12 .",
    "however , for very small @xmath6 the line shape ( voltage dependence ) , is strongly distorted and two peaks of positive weight of @xmath9 appears at moderate non - zero voltages . the line shape and",
    "its width depend also on the particular conditions of the experiment .",
    "this fact includes the case of the clean surface , as observed experimentally @xcite , and calculated before @xcite .",
    "a larger width and more intense resonance is expected when the wave function of the conduction state which lies at the fermi energy has a stronger amplitude at the impurity .    while the _ space _ dependence of @xmath9 is determined only by the conduction electron green s function in absence of the impurity ( see eqs .",
    "( [ didv ] ) and ( [ gf ] ) ) , the _ voltage _ dependence is very sensitive to the impurity green s function .",
    "most previous theories either assume or fit this line shape @xcite or are unable to explain the observed one because @xmath349 was assumed @xcite .",
    "also while numerical diagonalization with @xmath349 and a reduced basis set show spin - spin correlations which remind the conduction state at the fermi level @xcite , we obtain using additional approximations discussed in section v , that no appreciable projection to the mirage point is present in these correlations .",
    "this is due to the fact that the screening of the spin involves conduction states far from the fermi energy @xmath12 , while @xmath9 selects states near @xmath12 .",
    "these experiments seem unable to settle the still controversial issue of the kondo cloud @xcite . instead",

    "we believe however that these shortcomings affect quantitative details but do not invalidate our conclusions .",
    "previous results using larger values of @xmath8 and a different technique led to results very similar to the perturbative ones @xcite . a co atom also has extended 4s and 4p electrons , which should have a large hopping to the stm tip when it is near the impurity . this should affect the amplitude of @xmath9 at moderate distances to the impurity .",
