    "recently , experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to demonstrate the coherent optomechanical coupling between a quantized cavity field and the mechanical motion of a mirror located at one end of an optical cavity ( e.g. , see refs .",

    "many efforts have been made to propose new devices and explore the quantum - classical transition ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) based on such optomechanical systems .",
    "it was also discovered that such systems possess nonlinear optical properties .",
    "our study here focuses on another aspect of optomechanical coupling that can realize the kerr nonlinear optical effect in a vacuum , rather than in a conventional dispersive medium  kerr-2,kerr-3 .",
    "the kerr effect usually appears in nonlinear dispersive media  nonlinear , due to the third - order matter - light interaction . instead of resulting from higher - order light - matter interactions , we now realize _ the nonlinear kerr effect _ from the radiation pressure on an oscillating mirror .",
    "this oscillating mirror , located at one end of a fabry - prot ( fp ) cavity , is driven by an input laser field at the other end .",
    "the oscillating mirror is modeled as a quantum mechanical resonator , whose tiny oscillations are controlled by the radiation pressure of the cavity field .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out  @xcite that the vacuum cavity with a movable mirror might mimic a kerr medium when the cavity field is driven by a coherent light field .    in this article",
    ", we use the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation to derive a kerr - medium - like hamiltonian , which shows the underlying nonlinear mechanism more clearly than other ( equivalent ) approaches .",
    "we shall first point out first that , in the conventional bo approximation for a molecule the ( slower ) nuclear variables are adiabatically separated from the ( faster ) electronic variables .",
    "the stability of the molecular configuration requires the effective potential to have a minimum value .",
    "however , the generalized bo theory  @xcite for spin - orbit systems or cavity qed systems  @xcite does _ not _ have this requirement , and the effective force could be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1](a ) , we study a fabry - prot ( fp ) cavity with an oscillating mirror at one end , acting as a quantum - mechanical harmonic oscillator . the cavity is driven by a laser field with frequency @xmath0 .",
    "we first study an ideal case , without considering the losses of both the cavity field and the oscillating mirror .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath1contains three parts as    @xmath2    the cavity field with frequency @xmath3 is described by bosonic operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the symbols @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denote , respectively , the mass , frequency , displacement , and momentum of the oscillating mirror ( hereafter , we just call it the mirror \" ) .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath10 between the cavity field and the driving laser field is related to the input laser power @xmath11 and the decay rate @xmath12 of the cavity field via the relation @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction constant @xmath14 between the cavity field and the mirror stems from a very small change @xmath8 of the fp cavity length @xmath15 .     around their equilibrium positions.,width=307 ]    usually , the characteristic frequency of the cavity field is about  @xmath16 hz , which is much higher than the nanomechanical resonator frequency  @xmath17 hz achieved by current experiments .",
    "the cavity field would have _ no _ nonlinear effect under the bo approximation when there is no driving field ; nonlinear effects appear when a classical driving field is applied to the cavity .",
    "let us consider the case when the driving field frequency @xmath18 is close to the cavity field frequency @xmath3 .",
    "we also use the rotating frame of referencedefined by a unitary transformation @xmath19 , which is very similar to the nmr experiments used to demonstrate the berry phase  @xcite . in the rotating frame of reference , the effective form @xmath20 of the hamiltonian @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 1 ] ) reads    @xmath22    with the effective hamiltonians @xmath23and @xmath24here , the detuning @xmath25 is the effective frequency of the cavity field in the new frame .",
    "clearly , @xmath26 can be controlled by tuning the frequency @xmath27 of the driving field .",
    "therefore , the effective frequency @xmath26 of the cavity field can be tuned to be much smaller than that of the mechanical resonator . under such condition ,",
    "the mechanical resonator can be treated as the fast variable and the bo approximation can be employed .",
    "we first study the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) of the fast variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the mirror ( in the rotating frame ) by taking the slow variables  @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the cavity field as constants ( in the rotating frame ) .",
    "then the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28where the creation operator @xmath29 of the cavity field is defined by @xmath30with @xmath31 .",
    "( [ 2 - 6 ] ) shows that the mirror variables are shifted by the amount @xmath32 due to its interaction with the cavity field .",
    "it is clear that the ground state of the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 6 ] ) can be obtained via the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 2 - 1 ] ) for a harmonic oscillator with displacement operator @xmath34the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the mirror , corresponding to the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) , are , respectively , @xmath35and @xmath36eqs .",
    "( [ 2 - 9 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 10 ] ) show that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are functions of the slow variables of the cavity field .",
    "( [ 2 - 9 ] ) also shows that the ground state of the fast variables ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) of the mirror is a coherent state @xmath39 , resulting from radiation pressure .    according to the lowest - order generalized bo approximation",
    ", the total eigenfunction @xmath40 of the coupled system of the cavity field and the mirror can be factorized as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 satisfies the schrdinger equation with the effective hamiltonian @xmath43the bo adiabatic separation provides an effective potential @xmath44 for the slow  motion of the cavity field .",
    "this potential contains a typical @xmath45where the parameter @xmath46plays the role of _ the phenomenological third - order susceptibility _ as in usual kerr media .",
    "versus normalized detuning @xmath47 for the value @xmath48 .",
    "analytical results for the full hamiltonian are shown with a red dashed curve , while the bo approximation results are shown with a blue solid curve .",
    "note that squeezing occurs when @xmath49 , and the baseline @xmath50 is shown with a horizontal black dot - dashed line.,width=307 ]    we now verify the validity of the generalized bo approximation applied to the optomechanical system through the squeezing effect , which is induced by the kerr interaction .",
    "this squeezing effect can be demonstrated by the output intensity spectrum @xmath51 . following the definition of the @xmath51 in ref .",
    "@xcite and the linearization technique of the langevin equations governed by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 11 ] ) , we obtain the intensity spectrum under the bo approximation @xmath52where    @xmath53    with renormalized detuning @xmath54 and the steady - state value @xmath55 of the amplitude of the cavity field . here , the cavity loss @xmath12 has been taken into account .",
    "the bo approximation requires that the photons in the cavity can survive a sufficiently long time , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath56    if there is no kerr interaction induced by the radiation pressure ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 can be simplified to @xmath59 .",
    "when the kerr interaction is induced ( @xmath60 ) , the intensity spectrum can be less than @xmath61 , which displays a squeezing effect  @xcite of the cavity field .",
    "here , @xmath62 plays an important role in the reduction of the output intensity fluctuation .",
    "hence , the squeezing effect could be observed experimentally by measuring the intensity spectrum of the output laser",

    "@xcite . then at a particular frequency @xmath77 ( chosen at the position where @xmath58 is minimum ) , the intensity spectrum has the squeezing effect shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "now , we also study the intensity spectrum without the bo approximation .",

[ fig : fig2 ] ,",
    "can also be observed in the vicinity of @xmath84 .",
    "we use the same parameters for calculating the intensity spectrum under the bo approximation .",
    "therefore , the bo approximation is valid when the frequency of the oscillating mirror @xmath85 is much larger than the frequency of the light field @xmath86    the effect of the bo approximation can also be understood via @xmath87 .",
    "if the mirror frequency @xmath7 is much larger than the detuning @xmath88 of the cavity field in the rotating frame of reference , @xmath89 plays an important role in the vicinity of @xmath90 .",
    "when the bo approximation is valid under the condition @xmath91 , and when the macroscopic displacement @xmath92 is extremely small , the mechanical susceptibility is approximately equal to @xmath93@xmath94 which leads the intensity spectrum to have the same form as in eq .",

    "within the bo approximation , the cavity field inside the flexible fabry - prot cavity , driven by an input laser , exhibits a kerr - like nonlinear property .",
    "it is not difficult to generate a two - mode induced kerr interaction , which is useful for quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements  @xcite .    as shown in fig .",

    "thus two cavity fields , with frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the laboratory reference frame , indirectly interact with each other via this oscillating mirror .    in the rotating frame of reference , using the bo approximation discussed above , we can derive the induced effective interaction between the two cavity fields @xmath98where the @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 denote the photon number operator of the left and the right cavity fields . to perform a qnd measurement , the self - modulation term @xmath102 of the probe field",
    "can be ignored  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the system hamiltonian for the qnd measurement can be written as @xmath103where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the detunings of the left and right cavity fields , relevant to the frequency @xmath0 of the driving field .",
    "the kerr interaction in eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 2 ] ) satisfies the qnd measurement conditions  @xcite .",
    "since this two - mode kerr interaction commutes with the free hamiltonians of both cavities , we can nondestructively measure the photon number by observing the other cavity s conjugate observable .",
    "we have studied the kerr nonlinearity in the vacuum induced by the radiation pressure in typical optomechanical systems .",
    "such nonlinear interaction can be explicitly obtained via a bo approximation for an ideal case . through a squeezing effect , which should be experimentally observable via the intensity spectrum",
