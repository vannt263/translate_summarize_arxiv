    "we observe a previously unreported reversal in sign of our sgm signal : the differential conductance through the system is _ increased _ by moving the sgm tip into electron flow and thereby back - scattering electrons .",
    "we propose that this effect is the result of scattering between electrons in the beam and a non - equilibrium distribution of electrons near the injection point .",
    "previous transport measurements showed effects of 2deg heating when injecting high - energy electrons @xcite , but these previous measurements were not sensitive to the spatial profile of heating .",

    "we measure the differential conductance @xmath14 across the split - gate qpc using standard lock - in techniques .",
    "because the resistance through the system is dominated by the qpc , @xmath15 is determined by the transmission of electrons through the qpc .",
    "the transmission or `` openness '' of the qpc is controlled by applying a voltage @xmath16 to the qpc gates .",
    "we position a metallic sgm tip @xmath17 above the surface of the sample and apply a negative voltage to the tip , creating a depletion disk in the 2deg below .",
    "previous sgm measurements of the fermi wavelength in this device indicate that the 2deg density is suppressed to @xmath18 in the region between the tip and qpc because of the negatively charged tip and cantilever @xcite .",
    "as we scan the sgm tip , we record the change in differential conductance @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the background conductance of the qpc in the absence of the tip .",
    "when the sgm tip is above an area of high electron flow and there is minimal e - e ( inelastic ) scattering , the depletion disk scatters electrons back through the qpc and @xmath15 is reduced .",

    "we adjust the negative voltage on the tip so that it can still backscatter these high - energy electrons .",
    "however , e - e scattering can alter an injected electron s path in a probabilistic manner , so that the injected electron no longer completes a qpc - tip - qpc roundtrip , restoring @xmath15 toward @xmath20 as fewer injected electrons complete the roundtrip ( fig .",

    "the rate of deflection from the qpc - tip - qpc roundtrip path is thus not as fast as @xmath43 and a single e - e scattering event does not deflect an injected electron from the qpc - tip - qpc roundtrip path .",
    "this observation is consistent with previous measurements showing that because of the confined phase space for e - e scattering in 2d , e - e scattering occurs predominantly at small angles @xmath44 @xcite . at @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "1(e ) ) , the sgm signal has nearly completely disappeared . increasing the bias further to @xmath7 ( fig .",

    "we note that the bottom of fig .",
    "1(f ) includes a slight , wide suppression of @xmath9 ( blue ) , which is due to capacitive coupling from the tip negatively gating the qpc .",
    "we correct for the spatial dependence of this capacitive tip - qpc coupling ( see ref .",
    "@xcite supplementary information for details ) , but at high bias the qpc is more sensitive to slight changes in gating and thus some of this effect is still visible .",
    "this capacitive correction depends almost entirely on radial distance between the tip and qpc , and so can not create features with angular spatial variations like the branches of current .",
    "measuring @xmath8 means that the differential conductance is increased by moving the tip from a location with no electron flow into a location where there was electron flow at zero bias .",
    "usually the differential conductance @xmath15 is considered to be proportional to the transmission coefficient for electrons just at the electrochemical potentials of the two reservoirs on either side of a mesoscopic device @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unexpected that introducing the tip into the electron flow and thus backscattering electrons should increase @xmath15 . as a point of clarification , we find only the _ differential _ conductance @xmath14 increases when the tip is introduced into the current path ; the total current @xmath46 or absolute conductance @xmath47 still decreases when the tip is introduced .",

    "the effective temperature model does not take into account the anisotropic momentum distribution of electrons in the 2deg immediately after the injection point , and we emphasize that we only fit the dependence on bias voltage of an _ effective temperature _ needed to explain e - e scattering .",
    "more realistically , we expect the momentum distribution to be deformed so that there are more electrons traveling in the @xmath84 direction and fewer in the @xmath85 direction .",
    "this filling of states implies the 2deg will more efficiently scatter electrons moving in the @xmath85 direction ( electrons returning from the tip towards the qpc ) .",
    "while our @xmath91 model assumes an e - e scattering rate that is equal for both `` outbound '' electrons ( along the qpc - tip path ) and `` inbound '' electrons ( along the tip - qpc path ) , we thus expect the scattering rate for `` inbound '' electrons to be higher in a more realistically detailed model .",
    "we also recognize that strong scattering may occur very close to or inside the qpc where interactions between sub - bands may play a role .",
    "we have measured the spatial extent of the non - equilibrium distribution resulting from a beam of high - energy electrons injected into a 2deg , and we have observed surprising conductance behavior associated with non - equilibrium transport . we reproduce the main features of our data using a simple @xmath91 model and an assumed isotropic distribution of electron momenta . further theoretical work and experiments that discriminate between outgoing and incoming electrons may increase our understanding of non - equilibrium phenomena in qpcs and 2degs .",
