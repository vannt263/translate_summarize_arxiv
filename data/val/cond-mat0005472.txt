    "in recent years considerable attention has been devoted to studying the properties of disordered systems with the hope of understanding percolative phenomena .",
    "key to several such approaches has been the concept of randomness and also of frustration [ 1 - 12 ] .",
    "however , many of the patterns we encounter in nature are not random but self - similar and scale invariant [ 13 - 14 ] .",
    "for instance , the complicated and scale invariant structures that occur when a solid mixture evolves via an aggregation process [ 15 ] . to understand such systems the concept of fractals has been found to be very useful .",
    "fractals are scale invariant objects that may be considered as intermediate lattices between regular and random ( disordered ) lattices [ 13 - 14,16 - 17 ] .",
    "such a fractal lattice describes a class of random systems where the consequence of the loss of translational invariance of a lattice can be studied in detail .",
    "additionally , resulting from their dialational symmetry , statistical , mechanical and transport problems are solvable ; hence the attraction of the model in such studies [ 14 ] .",
    "in this paper we consider a particular class of fractal known as the _",
    "n_-simplex lattices , to model various properties of inhomogeneous materials [ 16 - 17 ] .",
    "the lattice is defined recursively .",
    "the map of the zero - order truncated _",
    "n_-simplex lattice is a complete set of _ ( n+1 ) _ points .",
    "the map of the _",
    "( r+1)_th order _",
    "n_-simplex lattice is obtained by replacing each of the lattice points of the _",
    "r_th order map by the entire _",
    "r_th order map .",
    "each of the resulting _",
    "n _ points is connected to one of the lines connecting the original _ r_th order vertices .",
    "the fractal and spectral dimensions of this lattice are given by : @xmath1 and @xmath2 the lattices with @xmath3 are of particular interest as they provide a family of fractals in which @xmath4 varies with @xmath5 leaving @xmath6 almost constant .    in order to understand how resistance scales with the size of the system , in a homogeneous system , we study the distribution of currents in a network modeled by an _ n_-simplex lattice .",
    "we consider each bond , where bond refers to a line joining two lattice points , of the zero - order network as a unit resistor offering resistance @xmath7 .",
    "a unit current enters the network at one of the external nodes and leaves through another , the rest of nodes being left open .",
    "it is known that the distribution of currents in such a network is found to be multifractal [ 18 ] in the sense that different moments of the distribution scale with different exponents .    for resistance",
    "scaling analysis two methods may be adopted , either ( a ) to obtain the distribution of current over the entire network and measure the energy dissipated in the system or ( b ) to simplify the network and obtain a closed - form solution .",
    "this second method has been used rigorously by us for resistance scaling and the results obtained by this method match those from the current distribution method .",
    "the moments of the current in a _",
    "n_-simplex are : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the current in the _ p_th bond and @xmath10 goes from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the cumulant for an arbitrary exponent @xmath14 .",
    "the currents flowing in at the external nodes of a @xmath5-simplex are represented by @xmath15 , @xmath16, ............ @xmath17 respectively ( see figure 1 ) with the condition @xmath18 .",
    "a scaling factor independent of @xmath15 , @xmath16 ........ @xmath17 can then be defined as : @xmath19    note that @xmath20 is related to the fractal scaling exponent @xmath21 . for a fractal with a resistance scaling parameter of 2 ,",
    "the _ r_th generation length scales as @xmath22 . using the definitions @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ", we get : @xmath25    the case @xmath26 determines the fractal dimension of the simplex because @xmath27 is simply the ratio of number of bonds in successive order of the _",
    "n_-simplex lattice ; @xmath28 measures the heat loss in the network and gives resistance scaling .",
    "it has been shown [ 19 - 20 ] that : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an exponent controlling the transport properties .",
    "in disordered material , the elastic scattering of the carriers at impurities leads to the random conductance or resistance fluctuation .",
    "the fluctuation arises from the interference of the scattered waves , and they are random .",
    "the magnitude of the resistance noise spectrum ( flicker noise 1/f ) depends on a new exponent , @xmath31 , pertaining to the fractal lattice .",
    "this exponent ( corresponding to @xmath32 ) is a member of infinite number of exponents required to characterize the fractal lattice [ 18 ] .",
    "the exact reason as to why this fluctuation occurs is unknown though it is believed that it appears in response to changes in many extrinsic parameters such as the carrier density , the applied measuring current , external electric fields and external magnetic fields .",
    "the spectrum of resistance fluctuation is given by @xmath33    the exponent @xmath31 associated with the scaling behaviour of normalized noise is given by [ 19 ] : @xmath34 as long as each bond resistance fluctuates independently with the same spectrum , the explicit frequency dependence can be discarded .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of @xmath31 [ 19 - 20 ] are given by : @xmath35    the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we derive a closed - form solution to calculate @xmath36 for any value of _ n_. in section 3 we use the current cumulant method to calculate the noise exponent for _ n_-simplex .",
    "the paper ends with a brief discussion on the bounds proposed and comparison with our results with experimental data .",
    "in this section we propose a simple method of calculating @xmath30 for any _ n_-simplex .",
    "consider a fixed current @xmath15 entering at one of the external nodes of the lattice , and leaving from another , all the remaining external nodes being left open ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we calculate the equivalent resistance between these two external nodes and establish a recursion relation between _ r_th and _",
    "( r+1)_th order lattices and use the real space renormalization group technique to find the exponents [ 18,21 - 22 ] .",
    "> from the symmetry properties of the simplex , it is apparent that all _ ( n-2 ) _ external nodes apart from those through which current enters and leaves are at equipotential .",
    "redrawing just those bonds through which currents flow , we have _ ( n-1 ) _ parallel paths for current to flow . of these paths ,",
    "one offers unit resistance and each of the others offer twice the unit resistance ( since they include two resistances in series ) .",
    "hence the equivalent resistance is given by : @xmath38\\ ] ] where r is the unit resistance and the square bracket contains exactly ( n-2 ) identical terms .",
    "this directly leads to : @xmath39    now if we consider a star of",
    "_ n_-branches , each offering a resistance of @xmath40 , the effective resistance between any two external nodes through which current flows will be @xmath41 as they are in series and all other nodes being left open .",
    "it is then straight forward to show using these transformation for @xmath5-simplex lattice that the following scaling holds good : @xmath42    > from equation ( 11 ) we know that for any _ n_-simplex the equivalent resistance of first order is : @xmath43 combined with equation ( 12 ) gives the equivalent resistance of _",
    "r_th order as : @xmath44    thus we see how , by merely knowing the simplex one can calculate the equivalent resistance of any iteration . no long winded applications of kirchoff s laws are required to obtain the resistance scaling .",
    "the exponent @xmath36 is related to @xmath45 by : @xmath46",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath47 moment of current distribution is associated with the noise exponent [ 18 ] .",
    "assuming that the cumulant @xmath48 can be expressed as a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath49 , the most general polynomial is a linear combination of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these polynomials are defined as @xmath55    however in present case @xmath56 due to current conservation .",
    "hence @xmath48 can be written as @xmath57    the next step is to determine @xmath58 . to establish a recursion relation between + @xmath59 and @xmath60 we obtained current distribution in an @xmath5-simplex lattice at each node .",
    "it is easy to see that the current distribution at each node is @xmath61\\ ] ] by current conservation . in figure 1",
    "we have shown the current along each bond .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the current cumulants of @xmath65th order of @xmath5-simplex lattice .",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath67 represents shaded region in figure 1 . above equation",
    "can be expressed as @xmath68 which establish the transformation relation between @xmath69 and @xmath65th order . comparing equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we obtain the recursion relation between the @xmath5-simplex lattices of the @xmath69 and @xmath65 th order . @xmath70",
    "the eigenvalues corresponding to the transformation matrix for the @xmath5-simplex lattice are given by @xmath71 and the fractal scaling exponent corresponding to largest eigenvalue is @xmath72",
    "we have seen that various moments of branch current give rise to different exponents , namely exponent @xmath31 associated with the noise amplitude , @xmath36 associated with resistance scaling and @xmath4 associated with the mass of the fractal .",
    "the relation between @xmath73 obtained in section 3 and the exponent @xmath31 for normalised noise is as follows : @xmath74    now , @xmath75 @xmath76",
    "this gives : @xmath77 or , @xmath78    now , @xmath79 or , @xmath80",
    "@xmath81    substituting this in equation(8 ) gives : @xmath82    this expression gives the respective values of the exponent @xmath31 as @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the 3 , 4 and 5-simplex respectively .",
    "it is clear that the inequality @xmath86 is satisfied in each of the three cases .    in the limit @xmath5",
    "goes to infinity @xmath87 goes to 1 .",
    "this is due to the fact that a large number of parallel equi - resistance paths are available for current flow .",
    "such a large number of paths are available that in going from one order to the next we are in effect not altering the equivalent resistance .",
    "the exponent @xmath36 decreases in magnitude as we go to higher dimension , implying that resistance becomes less dependent on the length of the fractal .    with regard to flicker noise ,",
    "we have seen that the scaling relation becomes increasingly complex as the order of simplex is increased .",
    "the noise versus resistance exponent @xmath88 is defined by the following : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given by : @xmath92 and @xmath93    the experimental measurements [ 19 - 20 ] of @xmath90 and @xmath91 were made on 2d - carbon - vax mixtures and found to be @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the direct plot of @xmath96 versus @xmath97 leads to @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the value we obtain for @xmath88 is in agreement with this as is clear from table 1 .",
    "however , similar measurements on two dimensional films and metallic films have given values of @xmath88 differing from what we predict .",
    "perhaps instead of taking the @xmath5-simplex lattice , if one considered a 2-d sierpinski gasket [ 13 - 14 ] better results could be expected . for all @xmath100 ,",
    "there is a finite dimension matrix whose largest eigenvalue will give the characteristic exponents .",
    "the matrix elements are function of @xmath5 and hence eigenvalues will be the well defined function of @xmath5 .",
    "but for @xmath101 the result will be obtained by smaller matrix .",
    "the generalization to higher value of @xmath14 and rescaling factor @xmath102 is under progress .",
    "we would like to thank yashwant singh and deepak dhar for many helpful discussions .",
