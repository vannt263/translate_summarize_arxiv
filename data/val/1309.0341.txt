    "the concept of an optical light shining through the wall ( lsw ) experiment has been adapted to microwaves as described in @xcite . a block diagram of the setup at cern as it has been used to search for axion like particles ( alps ) with microwaves is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ovrblock ] , it consists of two identical microwave cavities with a loaded quality factor of @xmath0 and a spacing between them of less than 20  mm .",
    "one serves as alp emitter and is excited by 50  w of rf power on its resonant frequency @xmath1  ghz .",
    "it develops a strong electromagnetic ( em ) field , corresponding to a large number of microwave photons @xmath2 .",
    "these can convert to alps by the primakoff effect @xcite .",
    "alps do not interact with matter and propagate towards the detection cavity , which is connected to a very sensitive microwave receiver .",
    "the reciprocal conversion process transforms alps back to microwave photons , which can be observed as an excitation of the seemingly empty and well shielded detection cavity .",
    "since there is no energy loss associated with the alp conversion process , the signal from the detection cavity would be observable at exactly the frequency @xmath3 , making a narrowband receiving concept feasible .",
    "in this section , we give an overview of the critical engineering challenges , which were encountered during the realization of the microwave based lsw experiment :    electromagnetic shielding : :    shielding is required around the detecting cavity and the microwave    receiver to eliminate ambient electromagnetic interference ( emi ) and    to mitigate coupling to the emitting cavity by electromagnetic    leakage .",
    "this would generate false positive results , as a signal    originating from leakage can not be discriminated against an alp    signal . within 2 cm , the field strength must be reduced by at least a    factor of @xmath4 to obtain    meaningful results and avoid degradation of alp sensitivity .",
    "most    microwave components used in the setup like sma connectors or    semi - rigid coaxial cables provide less than 120 db of shielding ,    making an external shielding enclosure and strategic use of optical    fibres for signal transmission necessary . with the current setup , over    300",
    "db shielding effectiveness has been achieved @xcite .",
    "detection of weak signals : :    the smallest detectable signal power during the alps run in june 2013    is    @xmath5  dbm  @xmath6",
    "w  @xmath7  photons / s .    as the experiment is carried out at room temperature , the thermal    noise * density * is @xmath8  dbm / hz . a very    narrow band filter can be implemented to detect the sinusoidal signal    within the background noise .",
    "it is realized by a discrete fourier    transformation over the entire recorded time trace of length    @xmath9  h. each resulting spectral bin will respond to    signals within its resolution bandwidth , given by    @xmath10 . as noise power scales    linearly with resolution bandwidth and",
    "signal power stays constant , we    achieve a signal to noise ratio improvement proportional to    measurement time . to keep the filter on the right center frequency",
    ", a    global 10  mhz reference clock is used to phase lock all oscillators    involved in the downmixing chain .",
    "this detection method has been    successfully demonstrated with resolution bandwidths down to    10  @xmath11hz in @xcite . keeping the cavities on tune",
    ": :    for an exclusion result , it is necessary to prove that the detector is    working and that a potential alp signal could not have been concealed .",
    "detection sensitivity will be limited if the resonant frequency of any    of the cavities does not equal the system frequency    @xmath12 within its 3  db bandwidth .",
    "the resonant    frequency of the cavities can drift due to thermal expansion . for the    emitting cavity ,",
    "the reflected rf power was monitored to ensure it is    on resonance during the whole measurement run . for the detecting    cavity ,",
    "its thermal noise density was measured before and after the    recording of experimental data , indicating its resonant frequency .",
    "compatibility with magnetic fields : :    as the shielding enclosure and the cavities have to be placed in a    strong magnetic field for alp measurements , they need to be    constructed from non - ferromagnetic materials like aluminium or brass .",
    "this is to prevent field distortion and to avoid strong attractive    forces during insertion of the setup into the magnet .",
    "some electronic    components like the low noise amplifier and the analog optical    transmitter need to be placed as close as possible to the detection    cavity .",
    "therefore special precautions had to be taken to ensure they    operate reliably within the magnetic field .",
    "for example , ferrite or    iron cored inductors or transformers had to be avoided as the material    saturates and changes its magnetic properties in strong magnetic    fields .",
    "r0.5 [ fig : exclsignal ]        the most sensitive measurement run for alps has been carried out in june 2013 in cooperation with the brain & behaviour laboratory of geneva university .",
    "we were able to operate the setup within the bore of a superconducting magnet , which is part of an mri scanner .",
    "it provides a solenoid - like field of @xmath13  t. over the course of one weekend , 2  x  10  h of experimental data were recorded . as no alps were detected , the corresponding exclusion limits in comparison to other experiments are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for diagnostic purposes , a sinusoidal signal of known frequency is emitted within the shielding enclosure .",
    "this `` test tone '' of relatively low and constant power ( @xmath14  dbm ) couples from a @xmath15 antenna to the detection cavity and to the components of the receiver frontend . by identifying the signal in the recorded spectrum ,",
    "we demonstrate that the entire signal processing chain was operational during the measurement .",
    "this also allows to evaluate unwanted frequency offsets , frequency drifts , or phase noise by comparing shape and position of the measured signal peak to the expected one .",
    "furthermore , as long as the test tone signal is observed with constant power during the measurement run , it qualifies that the em shielding performance has not degraded .",
    "figure  3 shows the resulting power spectrum from the measurement run .",
    "the test tone signal is visible as a single peak , clearly above the noise floor , spanning only one single bin .",
    "a frequency window ( shaded green ) has been defined with a width of @xmath16 , around the frequency where an alp signal would be expected .",
    "the peaks within this window do not exceed the detection threshold of @xmath17  w , allowing us to set an exclusion limit for alps .    in order to define the detection threshold , the histogram of @xmath18 frequency bins  containing exclusively spectral background noise ",
    "was evaluated .",
    "@xmath19 was set such , that only in 1% of all measurement runs , a single peak signal above the detection threshold would appear within the wisp window , resulting in a false positive outcome of the experiment .",
    "[ fig : resultspect ]    , no alp signal is visible above the detection threshold.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "profiting from the high mobility and ruggedness of a microwave based lsw experiment ( compared to optical setups ) , we were able to successfully deploy and operate the apparatus within a 3  t mri magnet .",
    "over the course of one weekend sufficient experimental data was recorded to achieve comparable sensitivity to first generation optical lsw experiments ( e.g. , alps-1 at desy ) .",
    "sensitivity could be further enhanced with a stronger magnet .",
    "there is a recent trend towards 7  t mri systems in medical research , which might provide us an opportunity for a follow up alps measurement .",
    "furthermore , sensitivity can be enhanced with larger and thus lower frequency cavities .",
    "one might think of a lsw setup consisting of 200  mhz sps standing wave cavities @xcite within the 3  t m1 magnet @xcite at cern . +",

    "the authors would like to thank r.  jones , e.  jensen and the be department management for encouragement and support .",
