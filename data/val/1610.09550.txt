    "the high sensitivity of rydberg atom - based rf electric field measurement is the result of the large transition dipole moments between rydberg states , @xmath2e@xmath3a@xmath4 depending on the transition @xcite .",

    "noise in the readout of the signal due to the eit probe laser can be a limiting factor for the sensitivity , as well as fundamental processes such as photon shot noise on the associated detector .",

    "collision rates between rydberg atoms and ground state atoms can be reduced by using lower vapor pressures but the desire to realize a spectrally narrow eit feature also pushes the measurements towards low probe rabi frequencies .",

    "details of the three photon calculations will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the three photon calculations imply that further improvements in the sensitivity needed to achieve the atom shot noise limit require a more sophisticated approach .",
    "photon shot noise is a serious challenge for rydberg atom - based rf electric field sensing .",
    "one approach that can work is to use squeezed light for the probe transition because it can reduce the photon shot noise .",
    "although using squeezed light is challenging , it is worth the effort .",
    "projection noise limited performance would make it possible , for example , to make absolute electric field measurements of thermal background radiation which is fundamentally interesting and would open up new opportunities in precision measurement , for example , studies of blackbody radiation .",
    "in conclusion , we used a mzi to cancel read - out noise of the probe laser for atom - based rf electric field sensing .",
    "we achieved a new sensitivity limit for the absolute measurement of rf electric fields , @xmath142 which was @xmath99 times better than our previous work .",
    "we showed the effects of key dephasing mechanisms on the measurements .",
    "transit time broadening , collision broadening , and power broadening were addressed .",
    "our sensitivity is around three orders of magnitude worse than the shot noise limit of the atomic sensor . by considering the mechanisms for the additional noise ,",
    "we conclude that photon shot noise on the photodetector is currently a limiting factor .",
    "we suggested a three photon method for reading out the rf electric field .",
    "this approach can make it possible to use the at splitting to determine weak rf electric fields .",
    "we predict that the three photon readout will increase the sensitivity by an order of magnitude , but will still result in photon shot noise limited performance in many cases . using squeezed light for the probe laser may lead to better sensitivity .",
    "although we demonstrated our approach with a free space mzi , it is possible to miniaturize the mzi for rf electric field measurement . a chip based , integrated mzi @xcite or fiber mzi is possible to realize and are likely to be the most useful approaches for rf electric field sensing .",
    "our results also show that it is possible to play off power broadening against sensitivity to increase the signal acquisition rate .",
