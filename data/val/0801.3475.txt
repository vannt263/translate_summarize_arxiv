    "for closed braid representations of topological links in @xmath2 the _ markov theorem without stabilization _ ( mtws ) @xcite states that for a fixed braid index @xmath3 there are a finite number of `` modeled '' isotopies ( dependent only on @xmath3 and not on link type ) that take any oriented link represented as an @xmath3-braid to a representative of minimal braid index without the need for increasing the braid index via stabilization  an isotopy essential in the classical markov theorem for closed braid equivalence .",
    "moreover , once at minimal braid index the mtws states that there are again a finite number of `` modeled '' isotopies ( again , dependent only on the value of the braid index ) that allow us to jump between conjugacy classes of minimal index .",

    "+ if we specialize the calculus to transversal @xmath5-braid knots in the standard - symmetric contact structure for @xmath6the kernel of the @xmath7-form @xmath8we get an intriguing glimpse of the structure within the mtws calculus .",
    "specifically , although positive destabilizations , exchange moves , and positive braid preserving flypes are transverse isotopies , closed braids which admit a negative braid preserving flype may not be transversally simple  classified by their self - linking number @xcite .",
    "in fact , transversal knots having a closed braid representation of minimal index @xmath5 which admit a negative flype but not a positive flype are the first explicit examples of transversally non - simple knots @xcite .",
    "+ the purpose of this note is to give evidence to a rich interplay between the structure of the mtws calculus and the classification structure of legendrian and transversal knot classes .",
    "this evidence comes from the synthesis of three different lines of inquiry : characteristic foliations of convex tori in a contact structure @xcite ; standard tiling of tori coming from singular braid foliations @xcite ; and the representation of legendrian knots by rectangular diagrams @xcite . +",
    "this synthesis is brought to bear on the etnyre - honda `` legendrian mountain range '' classification of the legendrian and transversal classes of the @xmath0 cabling of the @xmath0-torus knot  the first implicit example of a non - simple transversal knot @xcite .",
    "our initial result is an _ enhanced mountain range classification _ paradigm  a calculus structure imposed over the mountain range that enables one to `` climb '' the mountain without having to stabilize .",

    "finally , there remain modeled isotopies of the topological mtws that are transversal isotopies  including positive destablilization and exchange moves  and can be utilized to move between closed braid representatives of the same transversal class without increasing the braid index . + it is reasonable to conjecture that this stratification in the mtws calculus specialized to the @xmath0 cabling of the @xmath0-torus knot is prototypical .",
    "that is , coming out of the topological mtws calculus there is a legendrian mtws calculus for all legendrian links which will collapses to a transversal mtws calculus ; and what remains will be the transversal isotopies of the mtws .",
    "we advocate that understanding this stratifying structure is important to the study of contact geometry knot theory and a fertile area of research . in this vein , we take note of h. matsuda s recent work on stalling s links and their connection with additional structural aspects of the mtws calculus landscape @xcite . from a rudimentary understanding of matsuda",

    "although the modeled isotopy in figure 8 of @xcite is in the transversal setting , it is illustrative of the central issue .",
    "the `` isotopy '' portion of such a sequence can be highly complex  this particular modeled isotopy requires repeated uses of exchange moves .",

    "moreover , using formulas for the rotation number and thurston - bennequin number established in @xcite , one can calculate that for the diagram in figure [ fig : knotonpostrefk=1b ] , @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
