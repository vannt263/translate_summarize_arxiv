    "totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in one dimension ( 1d ) serves as a paradigmatic model for systems out of equilibrium , where fundamental questions concerning nonequilibrium statistical mechanics can be asked and explicitly answered .",
    "phenomenologically , it is used as a simple physical description for a variety of systems ranging from quasi-1d transport in cell biology contexts , e.g. , ribosome translocations along messenger rna ( mrna )  @xcite to fluid motion along artificial crystalline zeolitical structures  @xcite and movement of unidirectional vehicular traffic along roads  @xcite .",
    "the novelty of tasep as an open system lies in its ability to display boundary - induced phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "several different variants of tasep  @xcite , including effects of inhomogeneities have been studied  @xcite , shedding insight for nonequilibrium physics .    in this article",
    ", we consider the steady state densities in tasep in an inhomogeneous system with periodic boundary conditions , e.g. , a closed ring .",
    "unlike open systems , closed - ring systems admit strict particle number conservation , which is known to affect the universal scaling behavior near a critical point in uniform systems  @xcite .",
    "however , tasep on a uniform ring can not display spatially non - trivial steady state density profiles , due to the spatial translation invariance of the model .",
    "only when translational invariance is broken explicitly , e.g. , by connections with diffusive lanes , presence of defects or appearance of junctions and branches , inhomogeneous density profiles may appear  @xcite .",
    "in general , steady state properties of asymmetric exclusion processes on a ring with inhomogeneities have been studied by using various models .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite considered tasep on a ring with one point defect ( i.e. , a single slow site ) and found ldws in the steady states under certain conditions .",
    "subsequently , ref .",
    "@xcite extensively discussed disordered asymmetric exclusion processes by using the _ fully segregated model _",
    "( fsm ) , where the system has two parts with different hopping rates ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed studies on the various aspects of the effects of quenched disorders on tasep , ref .",
    "@xcite discussed the effects of quenched disorders on tasep and their connections with the dynamic scaling of kardar - parisi - zhang  @xcite surfaces .    in the present work ,",
    "we are generally motivated to study the possible density profiles with finite number of segments having unequal hopping rates as consequences of the mutual interplay between conservation laws and the scale of inhomogeneities in closed exclusion processes .",
    "we extend and complement the existing studies on closed tasep with inhomogeneities by considering a model of exclusion process on a closed inhomogeneous ring having multiple segments with unequal hopping rates .",
    "our model reveals nonequilibrium phase transitions including delocalisation transitions of ldws into delocalised domain walls ( ddws ) , distinctly different from boundary induced phase transitions in an open tasep ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for boundary induced phase transitions in driven diffusive systems ) .",
    "we discuss how these may be generalised for larger number of segments .",
    "in addition , we numerically explore the nature of fluctuations of ldws and ddws in the system and the associated delocalisation transition .",
    "our results should be of significance in understanding the phenomenologies of ribosome translocations along closed mrna loops ( _ circular translation of polysomal mrna _ )  @xcite with clusters of _ slow codons _",
    "along which ribosome translocations are inhibited  @xcite",
    ". we use analytical mean - field theories ( mft ) complemented by extensive monte carlo simulation ( mcs ) studies for our work .",
    "our main findings in this article are as follows : ( i ) when there are three or four segments of all unequal hopping rates , there should be one ldw in the system with the slowest segment being in the maximal current ( mc ) phase for moderate densities , ( ii ) for moderate densities with four segments having two non consecutive slowest segments ( of equal hopping rates ) , instead of a single ldw , there will be two ddws , each formed behind one of the slowest segments ; the slowest segments themselves are in their mc phases , ( iii ) we use our results from the three- and four - segment models to infer about the possible general forms of the steady state density profiles for arbitrary number of segments with different hopping rates , and ( iv ) we numerically uncover the scaling properties of widths of the ldw fluctuations , both near and away from delocalisation transitions .",

    "lastly , in sec",
    ".  [ scaling ] , we investigate the scaling of the fluctuations of ldw and ddws in our mcs studies . in sec .",
    "[ summ ] , we summarise and conclude .",
    "( see text).,width=287,height=188 ]    in order to set up the background , it is instructive to first review the results from the analogous two - segment system ( fsm ) , as elucidated in ref .",
    "it has two parts , chi and chii , of hopping rate 1 and @xmath0 , respectively ; see fig .",
    "[ model ] for a schematic diagram .",
    "assume equal lengths for chi and chii .",
    "if we represent a phase of the whole system by @xmath1 , then @xmath1 can be any of low density ( ld ) , high density ( hd ) , domain wall or co - existence ( dw ) and maximal current ( mc ) phase of chi and chii , respectively . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in great details , the system can be only in three out of all possible sixteen phases .",
    "these three phases are ( ld , ld ) , ( hd , hd ) and ( dw , mc ) .",
    "the above physical picture  @xcite can be made quantitative as follows .",
    "consider first the ( ld , ld ) or ( hd , hd ) phases and ignore the boundary layers ( bls ) ( having vanishing width in thermodynamic limit ) in mft , for which the bulk densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 are spatially constants in the steady states .",
    "then , @xmath4 in the steady states gives n_i(1-n_i)=pn_ii(1-n_ii ) .",
    "[ currentcon1 ] with the particle number density given by n= , we obtain n_ii= with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". these yield densities @xmath3 and @xmath2 when both of them are in their ld or hd phases .",
    "the two thresholds for @xmath8 , namely , @xmath9 , which mark the boundaries between ld / mc or hd / mc phases for chii ( or , equivalently , the boundaries between ld / dw or hd / dw phases for chi ) may be obtained by setting @xmath10 ( see below ) .",
    "consider chii to be in its mc phase , while chi is to have a coexistence of ld and hd phases in the form of a dw or a discontinuity in its density profile . by using @xmath4 ,",
    "we get n_i^2-n_i+p 4=0 .",
    "this gives us the solutions @xmath11 , both corresponding to the same @xmath12 .",
    "the two solutions meet at a point @xmath13 in the form of a dw in chi . more specifically , since chii has a hopping rate @xmath0 , lower than the hopping rate ( unity ) in chi , on simple physical ground we expect particles to pile up _ behind _ the junction b , so that when there is a discontinuity in @xmath14 : @xmath15 starting from @xmath16 , then jumps discontinuously at @xmath13 ( @xmath17 ) to @xmath18 up to @xmath19 .",
    "thus , in terms of the standard notations of a tasep with open boundaries , we identify the particle injection rate @xmath20 and particle extraction rate @xmath21 , thus giving @xmath22 , in agreement with the condition for coexistence in open tasep . with a dw at @xmath13 , we have n_i=_i+(x - x_i)(1-_i-_i )",
    ", @xmath23 is the heaviside step function .",
    "hence , there is a jump in density by a value @xmath24 at @xmath25 giving the height of the dw . using particle number conservation @xmath26 , we findx_i",
    "=- n- ( 2)(1 2)-1 2 . [ dw1p ]",
    "the phase boundaries ( values for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) are obtained by setting @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a phase diagram ) .",
    "we consider a closed 1d ring having total @xmath31 sites with three parts of equal lengths but with _ different hopping rates _ ( henceforth model i ) .",
    "equivalently , our model can be viewed as a tasep on a ring with _ extended inhomogeneities or defects _ ; see fig .",

    "the three parts , marked chi , chii and chiii ( in fig .",

    "particle exchanges between each pair of channels are exclusively allowed at their junctions a , b and c with dynamic rules defined by the originating site .",
    "if @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the average number denisities in @xmath40-th sites of chi , chii and chiii , respectively and @xmath41 denotes the total number of particles in the system , we can write , @xmath42 where , @xmath43 ( similarly for @xmath3 and @xmath44 ) . the mean number density for the total system , @xmath8 can thus be defined as @xmath45 we are , thus , left with a three - dimensional parameter space spanned by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , each of which is a bulk quantity and confined between 0 and 1 . tuning the phase parameters , we obtain the various possible phases of the system",
    ".     and chiii ( red ) has a hopping rate @xmath48 ( see text).,height=188 ]      we use and extend the idea outlined above . in our mf analysis",
    "we treat chi , chii and chiii as separate tasep lanes joined at junctions a , b and c , and analyse the phases of the model in terms of the known phases of an open - boundary tasep . for convenience , we label the sites by a continuous variable @xmath49 in the thermodynamic limit , defined by @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we represent a phase of the whole system by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 can be either the ld , hd , mc or dw phases of chi , chii and chiii , respectively .",
    "thus , all in all , there can be at most @xmath54 phases in the whole system .",
    "we now discuss whether or not all the phases are allowed by the constraints of the system . with the bulk densities",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath44 respectively , in chi , chii and chiii , the corresponding steady state currents are given by @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 in the steady states .",
    "consider the case where the particle motion is from chi to chiii via chii .",
    "we argue now that phases ( ld , ld , hd),(ld , hd , hd ) and ( ld , hd , ld ) are ruled out .",
    "we use the following characterisation of the phases in a tasep with open boundaries to delineate the phases in chi , chii and chiii of our model :    * when a segment chx ( x= i , ii , iii ) is in its low density ( i.e.,@xmath59 ) , there is no bl in the vicinity of the entrance of chx .",
    "we denote the corresponding uniform steady state in the bulk by @xmath60 , which is same as the injection rate . * when a segment chx ( x= i , ii , iii ) is in its high density ( i.e.,@xmath61 ) , there is no bl in the vicinity of the exit end of chx .",
    "we denote the corresponding uniform steady state in the bulk by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the corresponding extraction rate .    for concreteness ,",
    "consider first the possibility of the ( ld , ld , hd ) phase , with @xmath64,@xmath65 and @xmath66 being the bulk densities of chi , chii and chiii , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the junction marked @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ model1 ] has no bl , where as the junction @xmath68 will have two bls on both sides .",
    "we now use current conservation across junction @xmath67 and in the bulk of chi and chiii .",
    "these yield @xmath69 thus , we must have ( i ) @xmath70 and ( ii ) @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the only consistent solution of the above is @xmath72 , making chi and chiii identical .",
    "thus , if @xmath73 , there must be a bl at @xmath67 , which in turn rules out the ( ld , ld , hd ) phase .",
    "similarly the ( ld , hd , hd ) and ( ld , hd , ld ) phases also do not appear . using the particle - hole symmetry  @xcite ,",
    "the ( hd , hd , ld),(hd , ld , ld ) and ( hd , ld , hd ) phases are also ruled out immediately .",
    "furthermore , chi and chii can never be in their respective mc phases ( corresponding to a currents @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ) , since , the maximum permissible current in the system ( with @xmath76 ) is just @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the system has no phases of the form ( mc,@xmath78,@xmath79 ) or ( @xmath78,mc,@xmath79 ) where @xmath80 can be any of ld , hd , mc or dw phases .",
    "additionally , we can make the following general observations concerning the nature of allowed phases in the system . with @xmath58 in the steady states , for each of chi , chii and chiii in the ld ( hd ) phases , @xmath81 .",
    "for very low @xmath8 , all the channels are to be in their respective ld phases , with the bulk densities @xmath82 .",
    "thus , with increasing @xmath8 , @xmath44 reaches a value 1/2 , at which chiii enters its mc phase , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 each still less than 1/2 . using the particle - hole symmetry we draw the ( equivalent ) physical picture of the borderline between the mc and hd phases of chiii with @xmath83 .",
    "hence , on physical grounds , we identify different thresholds , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for @xmath8 , that demarcate the ld and mc phases , and mc and hd phases of chiii , respectively .",
    "the values for @xmath27 and @xmath28 are obtained below .",
    "clearly , with @xmath84 , chiii remains in its mc phase , i.e. , @xmath85 ( neglecting the bls in chii ) corresponding to a steady state current @xmath86 in the system .",
    "therefore , as @xmath8 rises from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , all the added particles must accumulate in chi and chii , such that @xmath87 is maintained .",
    "this suggests a coexistence of ld and hd phases in the form of a dw in chi or chii , so that with @xmath8 changing within the interval @xmath84 the total particle content in chi and chii changes due to shifts in the location of the ldw keeping @xmath12 and @xmath88 unchanged .    with chiii , having the lowest hopping rate being in its mc phase with @xmath89 , using the continuity of current in each channel , we write @xmath90 the two solutions for each of @xmath91 and @xmath3 represent either hd or ld phase densities for chi and chii , respectively . since on physical ground , particles start accumulating behind the slowest segment ( chiii here ) , depending on the exact configuration of the model , an ldw will be formed either in the segment with hopping rate 1 or with hopping rate @xmath0 . thus , given fig .",
    "[ model1 ] , an ldw forms in chii and then shifts towards chi as more and more particles are added .",
    "consider now an ldw in chii .",
    "as per our arguments , chi will be in its ld phase given by @xmath92 . in order to maintain the same current @xmath88 , @xmath3 will have two solutions which will meet at a point say , @xmath93 .",
    "thus we have a discontinuous jump in the density profile at @xmath94 . as in the fsm  @xcite , we identify effective particle injection rate , @xmath95 and an effective extraction rate , @xmath96 , thus satisfying the coexistence condition , @xmath97 .",
    "total particle number conservation in the model yields @xmath98 the density profile , @xmath3 with an ldw at @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the jump in the density by the value @xmath103 at @xmath104 , gives the height of the dw .",

    "@xmath47 , with @xmath112 .",

    "( [ 3_phase ] ) .",
    "its qualitative nature may be discussed in simple physical terms .",
    "the dw - mc region shrinks as @xmath114 .",
    "as @xmath47 decreases , the dw - mc region becomes wider having its maximum width as @xmath115 . in this limit",
    ", chiii has a vanishingly small hopping rate and hence the model is nearly blocked .",
    "considering that the dw phase in chi / chii is accompanied by the mc phase in chiii , thus chiii must have a density @xmath116 to be in its mc phase .",
    "notice that the current in the system in its dw - mc phase is @xmath86 and hence decreases with decreasing @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the total number of particles in chi / chii , required for them to reach an ld phase with a system current of @xmath86 and hence , @xmath27 marking the threshold between the ( ld - ld - ld ) and ( ld - dw - mc ) phases , also comes down with @xmath47 accordingly . using the particle - hole symmetry",
    ", we immediately conclude that the threshold @xmath28 between the ( dw - hd - mc ) and ( hd - hd - hd ) phase increases with decreasing @xmath47 .",
    "this explains the increasing width of the ( dw - mc ) region for decreasing @xmath47 in the @xmath113 phase diagram .",
    "taking density as the order parameter , we note that it changes continuously across the boundaries between the ( ld - ld - ld ) and ( ld - dw - mc ) phases , and the ( dw - hd - mc ) and ( hd - hd - hd ) phases , corresponding to second order transitions .",
    "this is in contrast to the first order transition from the ld to hd phases in an open tasep .",
    "hence , the usual first order line in a tasep is replaced by two second order lines here .",
    "our mf results are complemented by extensive mc simulations , which were realised by using random sequential updates together with averages over large number of samples .",
    "representative plots of @xmath14 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) in the ( ld - ld - ld ) and ( ld - dw - mc ) phases , obtained from both our mft and mcs studies , are given in fig .",
    "[ 3_profile ] .",
    "both figures ( [ 3_phase ] ) and ( [ 3_profile ] ) clearly show that while the mft results match qualitatively with the corresponding mcs results , there are minor quantitative disagreements between them , presumably due to the correlation effects which are stronger in the closed model here than for an open tasep .",
    "notice that there can be only one ldw in the system , either in chi or chii .",
    "if it is in chi ( chii ) , then chii ( chi ) will be entirely in its ld ( hd ) phase , characterised by uniform densities ( neglecting bls ) .",
    "nonetheless , there will however be a jump in the density profile at the junction b with the jump height being controlled by the difference between the hopping rates in chi and chii respectively .",
    "this jump survives even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , while in terms of the number of ldws , our model i yields the same results as the fsm model  @xcite , model i has additional density discontinuities in its steady states .    ) and ( ld - dw - mc , @xmath120 ) phases with @xmath112 and @xmath121 . points and solid lines represent mcs and mft results , respectively.,height=188 ]    , @xmath122,@xmath123 and @xmath121 ) .",
    "the dashed black line represents the mft result for the current while the points show mcs results .",
    "since the mcs results for the steady state current is calculated from their mean field expressions , these are valid only in the bulk , away from the junctions and any discontinuity.,height=188 ]    clearly if we set @xmath124 in model i , chi and chii become indistinguishable .",
    "in fact , with @xmath124 , our model i effectively reduces to the two - segment model in ref .",
    "@xcite , such that the slower part has a length half of the faster part . at this limit",
    ", unsurprisingly our results reduce to those of ref .",
    "@xcite . a current vs density plot is shown in fig .  [ 3_current_profile ] , corresponding to the ld - dw - mc phase in fig .  [ 3_profile ] .",
    "( see text).,height=188 ]    we now extend our model i to four - segment model ( model ii ) , having four parts of equal number of sites , but with all unequal hopping rates along them ( say , 1 , @xmath125 with @xmath126 ) . extending our arguments and analyses in the previous section ,",
    "it is clear that there are no qualitative changes in the overall density profiles of model ii , in comparison with model i : either all segments will be in their ld ( or hd ) phases , or , for intermediate densities , the segment with the lowest hopping rate ( @xmath127 ) reaches its mc phase , together with the simultaneous formation of an ldw in any of the other segments with its precise location being given by the total particle number conservation in the system .",
    "there are , however , surprises , when the different segments have hopping rates @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , respectively ( see fig .  [ model2 ] ) .",
    "thus , chi and chiii are identical to each other , where as , chii and chiv are mutually identical .",
    "total particle number conservation and the equality of the current in the bulk of every segment allow us to calculate the density profiles in each segment , just as above .",

    "physically , for very low ( high ) densities , all of chi , chii , chiii , chiv are in their ld ( hd ) phases , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 in the bulk .",
    "proceeding as above , current conservation in the bulk yields @xmath133 allowing us to obtain @xmath131 in terms of @xmath132 .",

    "as more particles are added to the system , chii and chiv should reach their mc phases ( similar to our analysis for model i above ) .",
    "then , @xmath137 since the currents in chii and chiv in their mc phases are just @xmath75 .",

    "we expect the above simple picture should hold good even for @xmath182 .      as we have seen before , in our model ii with hopping rates @xmath128 in chi , chii , chiii , chiv , respectively , the densities in chi and chiii display ddws for moderate densities , when chii and chiv are in their mc phases .",
    "on the other hand , if chii and chiv do not have same hopping rates @xmath0 , there will be only one ldw in the system at a location governed by the particle number conservation .",
    "therefore , as the hopping rates in chii and chiv approach each other , this ldw should undergo a delocalisation transition and two ddws emerge in chi and chiii .",
    "thus , the width of the ldw fluctuation should diverge in the thermodynamic limit at the delocalisation transition .",

    "this scaling behaviour is reminiscent of the correlation length @xmath213 in a magnetic system very close to the critical temperature @xmath214 .",
    "qualitatively , for a magnetic system at @xmath214 , the free energy potential well becomes flat even for large values of the magnetisation , leading to large magnetisation fluctuations .",
    "similarly in the present model , the positions of the underlying ldws of a ddw envelope can be anywhere within the ddw envelope with equal probability .",
    "further theoretical investigations going beyond mft should be useful in studying this analogy  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we analyse the generic steady state density profiles in tasep on a ring with extended inhomogeneities .",
    "we find for moderate average densities , nontrivial spatial dependences for the density profiles in the steady states , including ldw , along with second order transitions , and localisation - delocalisation transition leading to ddws . the underlying inhomogeneity configuration together with the overall particle number density controls the macroscopic density profiles . for instance ,",
    "we demonstrate that for very low ( high ) densities , the system is in homogeneous ld ( hd ) phases , regardless of the inhomogeneity configuration ( i.e. , for both model i and model ii above ) . for moderate densities ,",
    "the underlying inhomogeneity configurations become crucial .",
    "we find that in our model i , having three segments with unequal hopping rates , the overall behavior is qualitatively similar to that of the fsm model of ref .",
    "@xcite , having two segments of unequal hopping rates .",
    "both model i and fsm display one ldw for moderate densities , the location of which is determined essentially by the particle number conservation .",
    "when the number of segments increases to four ( model ii ) , with all unequal hopping rates , again there is generically only one ldw for intermediate densities , similar to our model i. however , there are now additional density discontinuities at the junctions between the faster segments .",
    "surprisingly , in model ii for specially constructed inhomogeneity configurations with hopping rates @xmath215 , the macroscopic density profiles are significantly different in having two ddws , instead of one ldw .",
    "we argue that this is due to the existence of more than one ( two here ) slowest segments in model ii . in general , our mft and mcs results match qualitatively for both model i and model ii , in general . while the instantaneous ddw positions can not be determined can not be determined from mft , we discuss how their long - time averaged density profiles may be constructed by using mft .",
    "we use our detailed results from model i and model ii to infer about the possible steady state density profiles and argue that depending upon whether the system has one or more than one slowest segments , either the system should show an ldw or a number of ddws ( equal to the number of the slowest segments ) .",
    "notice that the current - density relationship in a given segment is formally continued to be given by the same expression as for an isolated open tasep with an arbitrary hopping rate .",
    "equality of the steady state currents in all the segments ensures that in the slowest segment(s ) , the current can reach its maximum value corresponding to the mc phase(s ) .",
    "thus the form of the current versus density plots for the slowest segments should be identical in nature to that for an open tasep .",
    "in contrast , the maximum currents in the faster segments will be limited by the extended defects ( the slowest segments ) , as these segments will not reach their mc phases .",
    "thus , the currents in these faster segments will be less than their values in their putative mc phases had they been isolated open taseps .",
    "hence , in the corresponding current - density plots , the maximum value of the current will be truncated to a value controlled by the mc phase currents in the slowest segments , see for example  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "lastly , we study the fluctuations of ldw and ddws numerically .",
    "we show that the relative width of an ldw scales as @xmath191 , such that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath216 , an ldw becomes fully sharp .",
    "we also numerically illustrate the delocalisation transitions of an ldw in our model ii , when the hopping rates of two of the slower segments approach each other . assuming hopping rates of the four segments in model ii as @xmath217",
    ", two ddws are formed , with their spans diverging in the thermodynamic limit @xmath218 for @xmath219 .",
    "we numerically establish that as @xmath203 , the width , @xmath220  @xcite .",
    "overall , at the broader level our work reveals how the mutual interplay between the particle number conservation and the quenched disorder configurations yield different types of density profiles including ldw and ddws .",
    "our model serves as a simple starting point to study the effects of an arbitrary number of extended inhomogeneities on asymmetric exclusion processes in a closed system .",
    "additional biologically relevant details may be incorporated in our model , e.g. , the detailed features of the model discussed in ref .  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "how nonconservation of particles may affect the density profiles obtained here should be a worthwhile question to study . due to the minimalist nature of the model",
    ", we do not expect immediate quantitative agreement with specific experimental results .",
    "nevertheless , qualitative features of our results may be tested in ribosome density mapping  @xcite or ribosome profiling  @xcite experiments on model mrna loops with clusters of slow codons .",
    "in particular , it may be noted that arguments those yield the existence of ldw or ddws in our models for intermediate densities are independent of the precise lengths of the extended defects .",
    "thus , while we have assumed equal lengths for the segments in both model i and model ii for simplicity , we expect the qualitative features of ldw and ddw should survive even for short segments of several extended defects .",
    "this may be of particular interests in the context of mrna loops with slow codons , where the latter generally occur in several short segments . in the context of vehicular traffic flows",
    ", our model shows under what condition there may be crowding of vehicles behind extended bottlenecks in a closed network of roads .",
    "therefore , it is expected that in a closed network of narrow roads with no possibility of overtaking , one would generically observe either moving jams ( ddws ) or static jams ( ldw ) , depending upon the geometry of the defects .",
    "in addition , possible experimental realisations on the unidirectional restricted motion of interacting particles in narrow micropores ( with the mutual passage excluded ) , e.g. , in closed channels with circular geometry with extended bottlenecks  @xcite should make our model an intriguing system to study .",
