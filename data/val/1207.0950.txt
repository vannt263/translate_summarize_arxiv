    "* ) .    in the last few years it has been found that @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and sfr are strongly interrelated . analyzing galaxy measurements from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @xcite found that the mass - metallicity ( @xmath1@xmath8 ) relation for star - forming ( sf ) galaxies depends on the sfr .",
    "subsequently , @xcite reported the existence of a fundamental plane ( fp ) between these three parameters .",
    "these authors confirmed that the @xmath1@xmath8 and @xmath1@xmath9sfr relations are just particular cases of a more general relationship .",
    "@xcite fitted a plane and derived an expression for the stellar mass as a function of the gas metallicity and sfr ( the fundamental plane , fp ) . in a parallel and independent study , using the same sdss data , but different z and sfr estimations , @xcite found a similar fundamental relationship , but instead expressed @xmath0 as a combination of @xmath1  and sfr with a substantially different quantitative relationship .",
    "they refer to this correlation as the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) . in a recent study , @xcite used models and sdss data to analyze the dependences of different combinations between sfr , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "they found qualitative differences in the dependencies of those variables depending on the choice of approach in measuring the metallicity and sfr .",
    "a fundamental requirement in all these analyses is obtaining a reliable estimation of the galaxy metallicity . the most robust method to derive the metallicity in sf galaxies",
    "is via the estimate of metal abundances and abundance ratios , in particular through the determination of the gas - phase oxygen abundance .",
    "this is typically achieved through the analysis of emission - line spectra of hii  regions within the galaxies .",
    "a proper determination of the oxygen abundance relies on the detection of the [ ] @xmath64363 auroral line ( the @xmath10  method , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "consequently , it is common to invoke the so - called strong - line methods .",
    "these techniques assume that the oxygen abundance of an hii  region can be derived using only a few bright emission lines .",
    "empirical calibrations based on photoionization models , however , systematically over - predict by 0.2 - 0.6  dex the oxygen abundances derived using the @xmath10  method and those calibrations which are based on it ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the lower limit ensures that at least 20@xmath13 of the galaxy light will be inside the @xmath14 of the sdss fiber , which is the minimum required to avoid aperture effects @xcite .",
    "to ensure reliable metallicities , we imposed a minimum signal - to - noise ratio , snr  @xmath15 , for each of the most prominent lines h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , [ nii]@xmath66584 , [ ] @xmath65007 , and [ oii]@xmath63727 .",
    "the specific snr threshold chosen turns out not to be critical to the results , and this is demonstrated in more detail in section 4.4 .",
    "the impact of snr choice , and the selection of lines it is imposed upon , is explored in detail by @xcite , who show that for snrs between about 3 and 8 , the resulting mass - metallicity relation does not change substantially . for higher snr thresholds ,",

    "it is true to say from the former approach that , at a given mass , as sfr increases , the median metallicity either increases ( high - mass ) or decreases ( low - mass ) .",
    "it is also true to say from the latter approach that , at a given mass , as metallicity increases , the median sfr either increases ( high - mass ) or stays relatively constant ( low - mass ) .",
    "these statements are not inconsistent with each other .",
    "the confusion arises when trying to impose an interpretation that is inconsistent with the motivation for binning in a particular order .",
    "it would not be true to conclude from fig .",
    "[ metsfr]a , for example , that the median sfr decreases with increasing metallicity ( low - mass ) or increases with increasing metallicity ( high - mass ) , since the median sfr has not been calculated here .",
    "we emphasize here that when fitting a relation to a distribution of data , the full dataset should be used . fitting only to a representation of the full dataset that is derived from the median values of one parameter in bins of the others",
    "will clearly result in different surfaces being derived , and will depend on the choice of the parameter for which the median is estimated .",
    "a detailed study to tease apart the complex interplay of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , sfr , and ssfr that exploits this use of different binning order for all the relationships will be presented in @xcite .",
    "the use of a reliable metallicity estimator is crucial when analyzing the sfr dependence of the @xmath1@xmath8 relation as shown in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we recommend that the estimator of n06 be used with caution , and limited to the range ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath428.8 ) where the saturation of the n2 parameter is not a problem .",
    "the emission - line galaxy spectra from sdss are high quality , and measurements for many emission lines are available , making it possible to determine the gas - phase metallicity more robustly by applying techniques which consider the ionization degree of the gas .",
    "examples of these methods are @xcite and @xcite ( which are based on photoionization models ) and @xcite and @xcite ( which rely on datasets for which @xmath0 is known using the @xmath10  method ) .",
    "we analyzed the 3d distribution of @xmath1 , z , and sfr using three different approaches : @xmath43 fitting a plane using pca , @xmath44 ) fitting a plane through regression @xcite , and @xmath45 binning in sfr and @xmath1  to obtain the median metallicity of each bin @xcite .",
    "for the five methods used , we estimated the @xmath49 as a measure of goodness of fit ( table [ tablechi ] ) .",
    "we find that the best representation of the data is the plane defined by regression on @xmath1 .",
    "we compare the @xcite surface ( the fmr ) and the @xcite fundamental plane ( fp ) , and demonstrate that the best representation of the data corresponds to a plane . while pca does not provide the best representation , it does demonstrate that the 3d distribution can be adequately represented in two dimensions .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath8 , @xmath1@xmath9sfr , and @xmath71sfr relationships are then projections of this plane .",
    "we also highlight that the plane found by the regression fit on @xmath1is not developed as a new technique for stellar mass estimation .",
    "rather , this approach is primarily aimed at identifying the most concise representation of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and sfr in order to facilitate more detailed exploration of the interplay between these properties of galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , in cases when more robust techniques to estimate the stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not available , the use of the fp could be used to estimate the stellar mass , being careful to take into account the metallicity and sfr uncertainties .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath71sfr relation with the two approaches toward binning the data highlights a crucial need for caution in interpretation when exploring distributions represented as median values .",
    "the inappropriate interpretation of such results will lead to apparently contradictory conclusions , depending on the binning order used .",
    "furthermore , presenting medians in bins as a three - dimensional distribution will lead to differing representations of the data , depending on the binning order chosen .",
    "the sfr of a galaxy relates to the amount of gas currently being converted into stars , and correlates with the current mass in stars , while metallicity is a measure of the number of times that the gas has been reprocessed by stars , and also correlates with the current mass in stars in a galaxy .",
    "the fact that we can represent @xmath1  as a linear combination of sfr and metallicity suggests that the stellar mass of a galaxy can be thought as the rate at which a galaxy is currently forming stars ( sfr ) , plus a measure of the star formation history , here represented by the metallicity ( @xmath0 ) , corresponding to the amount of reprocessing of the gas by past stellar generations .",
    "the sf history and current sfr of a galaxy are closely linked to @xmath1 .",
    "there is now an abundance of high quality spectroscopic measurements from large surveys such as the sdss and the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey @xcite .",
    "these resources provide the means to calculate robust metallicity estimators for significant numbers of galaxies .",
    "managing the measurements from this growing data volume brings its own challenges , as well as the opportunity to explore scaling relations and broad population properties for statistically robust samples that can be divided into well - defined subsets in many different ways . approaching these challenges and opportunities in the most robust way possible , by using the most accurate measurements available ,",
    "will ensure that the most reliable scientific understanding of galaxy evolution can be produced .",
