    "though ads was once regarded as an academic curiosity , it has since attracted much more attention due to gauge / gravity duality , where ads solutions are dual to states of certain large @xmath1 strongly coupled field theories . due to the existence of a timelike boundary , the gravitational dynamics of anti - de sitter ( ads )",
    "are rather different than that of de sitter or minkowski space .",
    "if one imposes energy and momentum conserving boundary conditions , waves can reach infinity in finite time , reflect off the timelike boundary , and return to interact again with the interior .",
    "these returning waves can cause black hole formation @xcite or , in the presence of ergoregions , trigger superradiant instabilities @xcite .    in an effort to understand the superradiant instability",
    ", we investigate the existence of a special class of solutions to the four - dimensional vacuum einstein equation with negative cosmological constant , @xmath2 where @xmath3 the ads length scale .",
    "we focus on solutions that are asymptotic to global ads , where the boundary metric is conformal to the einstein static universe @xmath4 .",
    "we will be preoccupied by stationary solutions , but are ultimately interested in dynamical situations with reflecting boundary conditions , where the energy @xmath5 and angular momentum @xmath6 are conserved . unlike the poincar ' e patch , dynamics with this boundary metric and reflecting boundary conditions are non - dissipative .    amongst the most relevant stationary solutions to ( [ eq : einstein ] ) that satisfy these boundary conditions are of course ads itself and black holes .",
    "the carter solution @xcite , otherwise known as kerr - ads , is the most general black hole with global ads asymptotics that is known in closed form .",
    "kerr - ads with angular velocity @xmath7 suffers from the superradiant instability @xcite .",
    "this instability has its origins in the penrose process @xcite , where energy can be extracted from an ergoregion by particles .",
    "the wave analog of this process , where scattered waves can have a larger amplitude than the incident wave , is called superradiance @xcite . for asymptotically flat black holes",
    ", superradiant gravitational waves will simply disperse at null infinity . in ads , however , the scattered wave returns towards the black hole and extracts more energy .",
    "the process repeats until the ( now ) high - energy wave backreacts on the geometry , leading to the superradiant instability @xcite .",
    "the endpoint of this instability is an open problem in general relativity , which we will partially address .",
    "recently , a new family of stationary solutions , _ black resonators _ were found @xcite .",
    "these are black holes that only have a single ( helical ) killing field and can share the same energy and angular momentum as kerr - ads . though these black holes are entropically favoured over kerr - ads , they are still unstable to superradiance , and therefore can not be the endpoint of this instability . more precisely ,",
    "the ( yet unpublished ) results of @xcite imply that any candidate endpoint must satisfy @xmath8 , and all black resonators found in @xcite have @xmath7 .",
    "actually , for a given energy and angular momentum , there is a countably infinite set of black resonators , a subset of which can be labeled by an integer @xmath9 , with increasing values of @xmath9 labelling black resonators with increasing ( but still bounded ) entropy .",
    "furthermore , ( at least for small energy solutions ) as @xmath10 , these solutions have an angular frequency that approaches @xmath11 .",
    "it would be desirable to know if such a  limiting \" @xmath12 black resonator with @xmath13 exists since it would be a natural candidate for the endpoint of the superradiant instability .    to address this question , we first note that the zero - size limit of black resonators do not approach ads .",
    "instead , they connect to horizonless solutions of the einstein equation called _",
    "geons_. these were perturbatively constructed in @xcite and numerically constructed in @xcite .",
    "like black resonators , they only have a single helical killing field , and obey a simplified form of the first law , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angular velocity of the geon @xcite . in the limit where black resonators become arbitrarily small , @xmath16 . in this way ,",
    "small black resonators can be regarded as a small kerr - ads black hole placed in a geon with the same angular frequency .",
    "such an interpretation leads to quantitative statements @xcite ( following the methods used in @xcite ) that were tested and confirmed in @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems natural to suspect that a limiting @xmath17 black resonator would also be connected to a geon with @xmath18 .",
    "so now we ask whether such a  limiting \" geon exists . from the first law",
    ", such a solution satisfies @xmath19 , which are minimum energy solutions at a given angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "said another way , these solutions saturate the bound @xmath20 provided by the positive energy theorem in ads @xcite .",
    "one can thus formulate the question in a different manner : are there horizonless solutions of the einstein equation that are minimum energy , besides ads itself ?",
    "we answer this question in the negative by appealing to supersymmetry .",
    "although our original theory is not a supersymmetric theory , it still admits _ solutions _ which are supersymmetric .",
    "an example is empty ads , which admits four killing spinors @xcite .",
    "more generally , in ads gravity the positive energy theorem @xcite also states that the bound @xmath20 is saturated if and only if the solution is supersymmetric .",
    "we prove that any supersymmetric solution of which is asymptotically ads must be ads itself .",
    "thus we argue that the candidate endpoint to the superradiant instability of kerr - ads and black resonators does not have a regular zero - size limit .    instead ,",
    "if such a zero - size limit were singular , there must be a singularity located at the centre of a  limiting \" geon that can be covered by a horizon .",
    "we will argue that geons do not develop curvature singularities in their centre in this @xmath12 limit .",
    "the accumulated evidence therefore suggests that the putative endpoint to the superradiant instability does not exist .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : review ] , we review black resonators and geons . in section",
    "[ sec : positive energy ] , we then review the arguments of the positive energy theorem in ads put forth in @xcite . in section  [ sec:4d sugra solns ] ,",
    "we seek putative supersymmetric geons within @xmath21 gauged supergravity , by applying the results of @xcite which classify all supersymmetric solutions to this theory . we show that under the simple assumption of compatibility with pure ads gravity , the conditions of @xcite lead to a unique local metric tensor .",
    "imposing asymptotic boundary conditions completes the proof that there are no such geons .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of this result .",
    "in this section , we review the phase diagram of black holes in ads .",
    "let us begin with a brief discussion on thermodynamic ensembles .",
    "there are typically two ensembles where ads / cft is discussed : the microcanonical ensemble and the grand - canonical ensemble . in the microcanonical ensemble ,",
    "the energy and angular momentum of the system are kept fixed and the relevant thermodynamic potential is the entropy . in the grand - canonical ensemble ,",
    "the temperature @xmath22 and angular velocity are kept fixed , and the relevant thermodynamic potential is the gibbs free energy @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the area of the spatial cross section of the horizon .",
    "since we wish to discuss the relevant scenario where energy and angular momentum are conserved , we will focus mainly on the microcanonical ensemble . in this ensemble",
    ", black holes are preferred over pure ads due to their entropy . in the context of ads",
    "/ cft , black holes have an entropy that scales as @xmath25 for large @xmath1 , while `` empty '' ads has an entropy that scales as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "let us now review the construction of geons .",
    "recall that the spectrum of linear gravitational perturbations of ads @xcite is labeled by a type ( scalar or vector ) , and several wavenumbers .",
    "these wavenumbers are the polar wavenumber @xmath26 , the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath9 , and a radial wavenumber @xmath27 .",
    "the frequency is given by integer normal modes @xmath28 where @xmath29 for scalars and @xmath30 for vectors .",
    "the wavenumbers @xmath26 and @xmath9 come from spherical harmonics and satisfy the relation @xmath31 . due to the presence of discrete symmetries",
    ", we henceforth take @xmath9 to be positive without loss of generality .",
    "one can attempt to start with some linear combination of these modes and continue to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "generically , more than one mode is excited , and the fact that these normal modes are evenly spaced causes higher - order modes to be excited that grow linearly in time .",
    "this leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and is conjectured to precede dynamical black hole formation ( a nonlinear instability of ads ) @xcite .",
    "however , exciting only a single - mode gives no obstruction to perturbation theory .",
    "perturbation theory survives to arbitrarily high order and yields a perturbative construction of a new family of horizonless time - periodic solutions  the geons @xcite .",
    "there is therefore a one - parameter family of geons for every normal mode of ads . at lowest order in perturbation theory",
    ", one finds @xmath32 .",
    "a non - perturbative numerical construction of geons can be found in @xcite .",
    "these geons have a characteristic angular frequency @xmath15 and contain only a single killing field @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are asymptotically the time and azimuthal coordinates on the boundary .",
    "geons have finite energy @xmath5 and angular momentum @xmath6 and approach ads in the limit of small @xmath5 or small @xmath6 .",
    "black resonators can be found by performing a matched asymptotic expansion to place a small kerr - ads black hole on a geon background @xcite .",
    "the angular frequency of the small kerr - ads black hole must match the frequency of the geon @xmath36 , to ensure that there is no energy flux across the black hole horizon .",
    "for black resonators with small @xmath5 and @xmath6 , one can proceed perturbatively and obtain an approximate expression for the entropy @xcite : @xmath37 where the quantity inside the parentheses is guaranteed to be positive by the first law .",
    "let us attempt to maximise this entropy at a fixed @xmath5 , @xmath6 , which is equivalent to minimising @xmath38 .",
    "note that we have the bound @xmath39 this bound is saturated in the limit @xmath10 , @xmath40 , keeping @xmath41 , and @xmath27 finite , as first noted in @xcite . for definitiveness , we will later restrict ourselves to the @xmath29 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 family , and consider the @xmath10 limit .",
    "our conclusions will be the same for any other limit that has @xmath44 .",
    "black resonators are also solutions that branch from the onset of the superradiant instability in kerr - ads @xcite .",
    "that is , they are black holes that connect the onset of superradiance to the geons @xcite .",
    "let us therefore review how the onset of this instability was found @xcite .",
    "one proceeds via linear perturbation theory about the kerr - ads metric @xmath45 . recall that kerr - ads is a two - parameter family that can be uniquely parametrised by its energy @xmath5 and angular momentum @xmath6 . alternatively",
    ", this solution can also be parametrised by the angular velocity with respect to the boundary @xmath46 , and the area radius @xmath47 , where @xmath24 is the horizon area .",
    "the kerr - ads black hole has two commuting killing fields , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as well as the so - called @xmath48-@xmath49 symmetry which is a discrete symmetry that acts according to @xmath50 .",
    "now consider linear fluctuations @xmath51 , where we have used the killing fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 of kerr - ads to place the dependence on @xmath48 and @xmath49 in a fourier mode decomposition .",
    "the linearised einstein equation becomes a complicated set of pdes in the form of a quadratic eigenvalue problem in @xmath52 . for boundary conditions ,",
    "one chooses ingoing conditions at the horizon , and normalisable ( finite energy ) modes at the boundary .",
    "this system can be solved using the newman - penrose formalism , and by writing the natural boundary conditions for the metric @xmath53 in terms of boundary conditions for the so - called teukolsky scalars @xcite .    like the normal modes of ads ,",
    "the modes of kerr - ads are labeled by a type ( scalar or vector ) , a polar wavenumber @xmath26 , an azimuthal wavenumber @xmath9 , and a radial wavenumber @xmath27 ; so the frequencies can be parametrised in full as @xmath54 , or equivalently @xmath55 .",
    "the onset of the superradiant instability occurs precisely when @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , given @xmath57 , @xmath26 , @xmath9 , and @xmath27 , there is a continuous one - parameter family of onsets .",
    "the behaviour of these onsets is intricate , with different families crossing each other in phase space @xcite .",
    "black resonators branch from these onsets and connect ( in moduli space ) to the geons .",
    "each @xmath57,@xmath26,@xmath9,@xmath27 therefore yields a two - parameter family of black resonators ( which can be parametrised by @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , or @xmath46 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "black resonators were numerically constructed beyond perturbation theory in @xcite .",
    "now let us put these pieces together and consider the full phase diagram in the regime of small energy and angular momentum where we have perturbative control .",
    "as mentioned earlier , let us also restrict ourselves to the @xmath29 ( scalar ) , @xmath42 and @xmath43 family of black resonators and geons .",
    "this phase diagram can be seen in figure [ fig:1 ] . here ,",
    "the onset modes , the black resonators , and geons all have an angular frequency approximately given by @xmath59 . for a given @xmath9 , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 values of the onsets",
    "are approximately given by the @xmath5 and @xmath6 values of the kerr - ads black hole with @xmath60 ; the geons lie approximately at @xmath61 ; and the black resonators lie in the space between these two curves .    for the lowest value of @xmath62",
    ", these black resonators were found nonlinearly @xcite , and their entropy is higher than that of kerr - ads for the same @xmath5 and @xmath6 . from , black resonators with the same @xmath5 and @xmath6 have increasing entropy with increasing @xmath9 , but the entropy remains bounded .",
    "furthermore , all of these black resonators have @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , they must be unstable to superradiance . more precisely ,",
    "the ( yet unpublished ) results of @xcite mathematically prove that these black resonators are unstable , since no killing vector field that is everywhere timelike can be found at the conformal boundary .",
    "but , a number of interesting things happen in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "first , @xmath11 , which shuts down the superradiant instability .",
    "that is , a  limiting \" black resonator is stable to superradiance and , as we pointed out earlier , is entropically dominant to all other black resonators of the same @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "if such a solution exists , it is therefore a prime candidate for the endpoint of the superradiant instability .",
    "second , note also that the  limiting \" geon satisfies @xmath63 .",
    "that is , these geons minimise the energy for a given angular momentum and therefore must be a supersymmetric solution ( we will discuss the positivity of energy theorem in the next section ) . since black resonators always connect to geons , at least for the asymptotic charges probed in @xcite , we can address the existence of a limiting black resonator by attempting to address the existence of a limiting geon .    our argument that limiting geons saturate the bound @xmath64 relies on perturbation theory .",
    "it is possible that this is no longer true when considering the fully nonlinear geons due to small corrections in the perturbation expansion .",
    "however , the bound must still be satisfied ( as we will discuss in the following section ) , so the first law for geons @xmath14 implies that @xmath65 . that is , small black holes placed in a geon have @xmath66 , and so must be superradiant unless the bound @xmath64 is saturated .",
    "it is therefore sufficient for our purposes to assume that limiting geons satisfy @xmath63 .",
    "as we pointed out in the previous section , the @xmath10 limit of geons satisfies @xmath67 and we are interested in whether such a limiting solution exists . in @xcite , it is proven that generic asymptotically - ads solutions to gravity theories with negative cosmological constant , whose energy - momentum tensor satisfies the dominant energy condition , is either timelike or null , and future - pointing , then @xmath68 is also either timelike or null , and future - pointing . ]",
    "are subject to the bound @xmath69 and that furthermore , this bound is saturated if and only if the solution admits a _ killing spinor_. therefore the limiting geon we seek ,",
    "if it exists , must be a _",
    "solution to ads gravity . in this section ,",
    "we review the proof of the bound and its relation to supersymmetry .",
    "the authors of @xcite employ a similar line of reasoning to @xcite , which makes use of various properties of killing spinors .",
    "a killing spinor is a ( non - trivial ) spinor @xmath70 which is covariantly constant on the spacetime manifold @xmath71 , @xmath72 for some notion of covariant derivative ( which includes the levi - civit connection in the spin representation , as well as possibly terms coming from gauge connections and the cosmological constant ) .",
    "given a solution to , one can construct a variety of quantities out of spinor bilinears , is some appropriately - defined conjugate spinor . ]",
    "@xmath73 } \\epsilon , \\qquad \\text{etc.},\\ ] ] which then inherit from a number of first - order differential relations .",
    "in particular , the vector @xmath74 , so constructed , is always a killing vector , and justifies our calling spinor solutions to `` killing '' . using fierz identities",
    ", one can also show that a number of algebraic relations hold , including ( taking the metric signature to be `` mostly plus '' ) @xmath75 and thus @xmath74 is timelike or null .    to obtain the energy bound",
    ", we will find it useful to consider ads as a 4-dimensional submanifold of @xmath76 defined by the quadric surface @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the cosmological constant .",
    "we then consider , as discussed in @xcite , a collection of currents @xmath79 which generate the @xmath80 group under which is invariant .",
    "then @xmath81 corresponds to the energy @xmath5 , and @xmath82 corresponds to the angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the remaining @xmath79 can be made to vanish by an appropriate @xmath80 rotation .",
    "choosing @xmath70 to be a 4-component commuting dirac spinor , the appropriate covariant derivative in the presence of a ( negative ) cosmological constant is @xmath83 where we shall match the gamma - matrix conventions of @xcite .",
    "with respect to this covariant derivative , it is easy to show that empty ads spacetime admits four linearly - independent killing spinors .",
    "we are then interested in more general spacetimes which are asymptotically ads .",
    "while these spacetimes will not admit killing spinors in general , they must admit _ asymptotic _ solutions to , in the sense that @xmath84 as this is merely the condition that a solution approach ads sufficiently fast .",
    "the spinor @xmath70 itself approaches @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a constant , non - zero spinor and @xmath57 satisfies @xmath87 .    following @xcite",
    ", one can construct out of @xmath70 an antisymmetric tensor @xmath88},\\ ] ] such that the @xmath79 are given by the surface integral of @xmath89 on the @xmath90 at infinity : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the generators of @xmath93 in the spin representation .",
    "one can then apply stokes theorem to obtain @xmath94 where now the integral is over the entire hyperslice @xmath95 .",
    "surface terms ( such as at internal horizons ) can be avoided by taking @xmath95 to be a smooth 3-surface which is everywhere spacelike .",
    "the divergence of is @xmath96 + \\mathrm{c.c.},\\ ] ] and the second term , after using the ricci identity and the einstein equation , can be written in terms of the energy - momentum tensor of all the matter fields : @xmath97 thus the integral becomes @xmath98 \\ , { \\mathrm{d}}\\sigma_\\mu.\\ ] ]",
    "as stated earlier , the vector @xmath99 is always timelike or null .",
    "therefore if @xmath100 satisfies the dominant energy condition , then the second term in is always non - negative .",
    "this establishes that @xmath79 is bounded by @xmath101 \\ , { \\mathrm{d}}\\sigma_\\mu.\\ ] ]    to complete the proof , one chooses orthonormal frames such that the 0 direction is normal to @xmath95 . in this basis ,",
    "the integral can be expanded as ( indices @xmath102 are 3-dimensional indices along @xmath95 ) : @xmath103 \\ , { \\mathrm{d}}\\sigma_0.\\ ] ] one then observes that on any smooth spacelike surface @xmath95 , the ",
    "witten condition \" @xmath104 is an elliptic equation and has no zero modes .",
    "thus there always exists a solution on @xmath95 satisfying the boundary conditions , for a given @xmath86 . choosing this @xmath70 , we then have @xmath105 and , since @xmath86 was arbitrary , the matrix ( in the spinor indices ) sandwiched between @xmath106 on the left - hand side is seen to be positive semidefinite . taking its trace , we obtain @xmath107 and thus @xmath108 furthermore , we see that is saturated only if @xmath109 this is an equation only on @xmath95 ; however ,",
    "by choosing a slightly different @xmath95 with the same boundary , one can show that @xmath70 must in fact solve the full killing spinor equation on @xmath71 : @xmath110 thus one has shown that , in asymptotically - ads spacetimes , the energy is bounded from below by the angular momentum , and this bound is saturated only if the spacetime admits a killing spinor .",
    "in @xcite it is furthermore shown that if @xmath111 , then one in fact has _",
    "four _ killing spinors , and the spacetime must be ads itself . if @xmath111 , then we must have that @xmath112 for _ all _ choices of @xmath86 .",
    "this implies that we have a complete basis of killing spinors . from one",
    "can obtain an integrability condition for killing spinors to exist : @xmath113 } \\epsilon = \\frac14 \\big [ r_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma } + \\frac23 \\lambda \\",

    "the asymptotic boundary conditions then imply that the spacetime is ads .",
    "however , this argument does not apply to our situation , where we assume only that @xmath115 , which _ a priori _ can be saturated for any @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , geons always have @xmath116 . in the following section ,",
    "we develop a more general argument that relies on weaker assumptions .",
    "to prove that the only asymptotically - ads solution to with killing spinors is ads , we approach the problem from @xmath21 gauged supergravity . to a purist studying the problem , this may seem like an extraneous maneuver ; supergravity theories contain numerous additional fields , such as gauge fields and scalars , and their fermionic superpartners .",
    "but a supergravity theory can inform us about supersymmetric solutions to pure einstein gravity by choosing these additional fields to be trivial .",
    "we choose @xmath21 gauged supergravity because a simple classification exists in the literature @xcite of its supersymmetric classical configurations .",
    "the field content is solely that of the @xmath21 gravity multiplet , consisting of a graviton , two gravitini , and a maxwell gauge field : @xmath117 and the action is that of einstein - maxwell-@xmath118 plus fermi terms .",
    "we are interested in classical solutions ( thus @xmath119 ) where the gauge field @xmath120 , and thus these solutions also solve .",
    "in @xcite the authors work out the conditions which must be satisfied in order for a classical solution be supersymmetric .",
    "these are essentially the existence of a killing spinor @xmath121 where @xmath122 contains the usual cosmological term as in , as well as a twist constructed out of the ` supercovariant ' gauge field strength @xmath123 . to obtain a useful set of supersymmetry conditions , one constructs various spinor bilinears out of @xmath70 and explores the consequences of and the fierz identities .    here",

    "moreover , since the function @xmath125 is independent of @xmath128 , then we conclude that @xmath128 is _ also _ a killing vector of @xmath147 , and @xmath129 and @xmath128 commute .",
    "thus we can reduce the problem to cohomogeneity 2 .",
    "first we find the appropriate conformal rescaling @xmath127 .",
    "choose @xmath148 for some coordinate @xmath149 ( not necessarily the same one as in @xcite ) .",
    "we want @xmath150 and hence we must choose @xmath151 now we write down a metric ansatz for @xmath147 . since @xmath128 and @xmath129 commute and @xmath152 ( which is preserved under conformal rescaling ) , we can write @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a 2-dimensional metric in some coordinates @xmath155 , and all quantities depend only on @xmath155 . re - inserting the conformal factor , we have @xmath156 , and thus @xmath157,\\ ] ] where now @xmath127 may depend on @xmath149 , but all other quantities are functions of @xmath158 only .    from the algebraic supersymmetry conditions ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath159 .",
    "now let us implement the differential conditions .",
    "first @xmath160 gives @xmath161 where we define @xmath162 to act only on @xmath158 .",
    "hence it must be true that @xmath163 , and thus @xmath164 can be eliminated by a shift in the definition of @xmath149 .",
    "what remains is @xmath165 but the right - hand side generically depends on @xmath149 , while the left - hand side does not .",
    "thus we are left with two possibilities :    a.   _ case 1 _ : in fact @xmath166 , and thus @xmath167 , or b.   _ case 2 _ : @xmath168 , and thus @xmath169 .",
    "that is , @xmath170 is a constant , and @xmath127 is a function of @xmath149 only .    in the first case , by one",
    "would have @xmath171 , and then by the second relation in , one would have @xmath172 .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with supersymmetry , which requires @xmath129 to be non - vanishing .",
    "therefore the first case is eliminated .",
    "proceeding with the second case , then , we can choose @xmath173 without loss of generality , and @xmath174 only .",
    "the metric ansatz becomes @xmath175.\\ ] ]      to proceed further , it is useful to choose a different gauge .",
    "the metric contains a term @xmath176 , which we may easily change into any form we like .",
    "first we observe that @xmath177 next we use @xmath178 , which gives @xmath179 keeping this in mind , we can also approach from the other direction . combining the facts",
    "@xmath180 we can integrate the first equation and obtain again @xmath181 .",
    "thus we set @xmath182 , and we can write the metric as @xmath183.\\ ] ] it is also useful to write down that , in this gauge , we have @xmath184    there is one remaining supersymmetry condition to impose , given by @xmath185\\ ] ] taking the exterior derivative of this results in the condition @xmath186 we point out that on a 2-surface with metric @xmath154 , one always has a complex structure and @xmath187 is its khler 2-form .",
    "thus the angular momentum @xmath52 is @xmath188 times the 1-form potential of the khler form .",
    "the supersymmetry conditions we have solved thus far are not sufficient to solve the equations of motion .",
    "we must also use the einstein equation @xmath189 we will show that this is sufficient to fix the constant @xmath190 and the 2-metric @xmath191 to begin , we find it useful to define @xmath192 then the metric ansatz becomes @xmath193 defining @xmath194 as the term in parentheses , the ricci tensor of is easy to compute : @xmath195 and imposing @xmath196 reveals @xmath197 as expected . plugging in @xmath198 on the left ,",
    "the functions of @xmath199 drop out , and on the 3-metric @xmath200 we obtain @xmath201    next , we compute the ricci tensor of @xmath194 , and applying , we obtain @xmath202 comparing to , we must have @xmath203 but this now uniquely fixes @xmath154 : @xmath204 then the local form of the metric @xmath126 is completely fixed . rescaling @xmath205 , we can write @xmath206,\\ ] ] which is the metric of @xmath0 written with @xmath207 slices .",
    "therefore we have shown that the only solutions with timelike killing vector and at least one supersymmetry are locally ads .",
    "applying our boundary conditions , we thus prove that the only asymptotically - ads `` geon '' with @xmath115 whose killing vector is _ timelike _ in some finite region must in fact be ads itself .      in the case",
    "that the killing vector @xmath208 is null , the authors of @xcite have obtained the general solution in a form that is easily adaptable to our purpose , so we do not repeat their calculation here .",
    "the result , for vanishing maxwell field @xmath131 , is given by the metric @xmath209 where @xmath210 and the function @xmath211 must solve @xmath212 the metric has previously been considered by siklos @xcite ( a particular example was first found in @xcite ; for review and analysis see @xcite ) .",
    "one can write down the general solution to by first observing the following identity of operators @xcite : @xmath213 hence the function @xmath211 can be written @xmath214 for an arbitrary holomorphic function @xmath127 .",
    "holomorphicity of @xmath127 is a very strong constraint , and we will show that this is enough to fix @xmath211 .",
    "we apply boundary conditions .",
    "the metric resembles the poincar patch of ads , and so infinity lies at @xmath215 . to obtain ads asymptotics",
    ", we must have @xmath216 for the function @xmath127 , this corresponds to @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a constant and @xmath219 is an arbitrary function of @xmath220 .",
    "likewise , in the limit @xmath221 we demand regularity , which requires @xmath222 for the function @xmath127 , this means @xmath223 but in order for spacetime to be smooth on @xmath224 , the function @xmath127 must be holomorphic on @xmath225 . thus and must actually be the same laurent series , and @xmath226 exactly .",
    "this implies that @xmath227 everywhere , and thus the metric is ( locally ) uniquely fixed to be ads .",
    "applying our global boundary condition , we thus prove that an asymptotically - ads `` geon '' with @xmath115 and killing vector which is _ null _ in some finite region must in fact be ads itself .",
    "thus we prove that in both cases ( with either timelike or null killing field ) , the unique supersymmetric solution asymptotic to ads is ads itself , and there can be no geons with @xmath115 .",
    "let us summarise our results . for any energy and angular momentum in the superradiant regime of kerr - ads ,",
    "there is a countably infinite family of black resonators labeled by an integer @xmath9 .",
    "all of these black resonators have more entropy than kerr , but are nevertheless still unstable to superradiance .",
    "however , taking the limit @xmath10 shuts down superradiance and also maximises the entropy .",
    "therefore , a limiting solution , if it exists , is a natural candidate for the endpoint of the superradiant instability .",
    "but the zero - size limit of these limiting black resonators is expected to be a geon that saturates the minimum energy bound , and is therefore a supersymmetric solution .",
    "such a geon can not exist because the only supersymmetric vacuum solution with ads asymptotics is ads itself .",
    "these results support the claim that such a limiting black resonator solution does not exist , since they would not have a zero - size limit .",
    "but , the proof that ads is the only supersymmetric solution assumes smoothness .",
    "there could be a limiting geon that is singular , and it is conceivable for a regular black resonator to cover a singularity with its horizon .",
    "we find this possibility unlikely since the singularity must appear at the centre of the limiting geon in order for a black hole to cover it .",
    "evidence suggests that the centre of geons becomes smoother ( i.e. the curvatures become smaller ) rather than more singular in the @xmath10 limit .",
    "the perturbative results of @xcite found that curvatures in the centre of geons decrease with increasing @xmath9 for @xmath62 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 .",
    "furthermore , the perturbation functions behave near the origin as @xmath230 , suggesting that the centre becomes flatter with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "though , this is not a proof as there may be other factors of @xmath9 that would affect the curvature .    besides the  limiting \" resonators , we know of no other candidate solution for the endpoint of superradiance .",
    "if there is indeed no regular solution that is also stable to superradiance , then there are two logical possibilities for the endpoint of the superradiant instability : either a singular solution is reached in finite time , or the system never settles to any solution .",
    "the former would be a violation of cosmic censorship , such as in @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "it is entropically favorable that structure develops on smaller and smaller scales , because black resonators with higher @xmath9 have higher entropy , and for all @xmath9 are still unstable to superradiance , as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "at some point , the effects of quantum gravity would become significant , thus violating the spirit , if not the letter , of cosmic censorship .",
