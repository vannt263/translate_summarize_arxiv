    "gravitational effects of dark matter have been observed in galaxies , clusters of galaxies , the large scale structure of the universe and the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "these observations indicate that dark matter accounts for about @xmath0 of the matter density in the universe and for @xmath1 of its total energy density . it must therefore be considered today to be one of the essential ingredients of our universe .",
    "viable dark matter particles should be neutral , stable and weakly interacting , and , to be consistent with the observed large scale structure of the universe , behave as _ cold _ dark matter . since none of the standard model particles satisfies these conditions , dark matter provides strong evidence for new physics , and",
    "indeed most extensions of the standard model include dark matter candidates .",
    "wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) dark matter represents a generic scenario , that can naturally account for the observed dark matter density via freeze - out in the early universe . here",
    ", the dark matter candidate is a weakly interacting particle with a mass around the tev scale - the same scale that is currently being probed by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the idea behind minimal models of dark matter is to extend the standard model in a minimal way , so that dark matter can be explained .",
    "typically , these models feature a small number of additional fields and a new discrete symmetry that stabilises the dark matter particle .",
    "they include models such as the inert doublet model @xcite , the radiative seesaw model @xcite , and the singlet fermion model @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of two dark matter particles is yet another possibility that is currently being explored @xcite , as are coannihilations of dark matter and other particles @xcite .      in this model ,",
    "the standard model is extended with an additional scalar doublet , @xmath2 , which is assumed to be odd under a discrete @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the dark matter candidate is the neutral component of this new doublet ( @xmath4 ) and is then a wimp featuring gauge and scalar interactions .    at the tree level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , the @xmath5-@xmath4 scattering relevant for direct detection    tree - level feynman diagram for the direct detection cross section of inert higgs dark matter . ]",
    "proceeds via a higgs - mediated diagram and is determined by a scalar coupling .",
    "following the recent lhc discovery of a standard - model like higgs boson , we set @xmath6 gev .    at the one - loop level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , the spin - independent direct detection cross section receives new contributions from @xmath7- and @xmath8-mediated diagrams which are determined by the gauge couplings .    as a result",
    ", the one - loop contribution can actually dominate the direct detection cross section .",
    "in fact , it provides a lower bound on the spin - independent cross section that is within the reach of planned experiments such as xenon1 t @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "scatter plot of the spin - independent direct detection cross section at tree - level and at one - loop as a function of the dark matter mass . in this figure",
    "all the parameters of the inert higgs model were allowed to vary randomly and all experimental bounds were taken into account @xcite . ]",
    "the radiative seesaw model is an extension of the inert doublet model by three singlet fermions @xmath9 that are odd under the @xmath3 .",
    "its lagrangian includes the following terms : @xmath10 the main feature of this model is that it can account also for neutrino masses .",
    "they are generated at one loop and are given by @xmath11    if some of the singlet fermions have a mass slightly larger than that of @xmath4 , coannihilations with @xmath9 become relevant and give rise to an _ increase _ in the relic density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .    the relic density as a function of @xmath12 for different values of @xmath13 . in this figure",
    "we have set @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and we have assumed that the three fermions have the same mass : @xmath17 . notice that @xmath18 decreases with increasing @xmath13 @xcite . ]",
    "the relic density thus strongly depends on the mass difference between @xmath4 and the singlet fermions .",
    "the resulting indirect detection rate is large and provides a constraint on the parameter space of the model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) @xcite .",
    "regions in the plane ( @xmath12,@xmath19 ) that are consistent with the dark matter constraint for different numbers of coannihilating @xmath20 @xcite . ]",
    "the region in the plane ( @xmath21,@xmath12 ) that is compatible with the dark matter constraint .",
    "different symbols are used to distinguish the dominant annihilation final states .",
    "the dashed ( red ) line shows the resonance condition : @xmath22 @xcite . ]      in this model , the standard model is extended with a singlet fermion ( @xmath23 ) and a singlet scalar ( @xmath24 ) , which are odd and even under a @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the fermion is therefore the dark matter candidate and interacts via @xmath25 the new scalar mixes with the higgs boson , giving rise to the mass eigenstates @xmath26 and @xmath2 .",
    "the dark matter annihilates mainly into four different channels : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , some regions of the parameter space can already be excluded by direct detection constraints .",
    "the reach of current and future direct detection experiments @xcite in the singlet fermion model below the resonance @xcite . ]",
    "using three different examples for minimal extensions of the standard model , we have illustrated in these proceedings the interplay of the higgs boson discovery and dark matter relic density constraints and their implications for direct and indirect searches for dark matter .",
