    "optical properties of dense exciton gas in quantum wells had been studied intensively both experimentally and theoretically in the past decade .",
    "originally , attempts to obtain dense exciton gas were motivated by a desire to reach bose - einstein condensation of excitons .",
    "however , the fascinating observed physical phenomena and the promising potential for device application had made the exciton gas a very interesting system by itself .",
    "recent experiments have stressed the importance of exciton - exciton interaction of two - dimensional ( 2d ) excitons in quantum wells .",
    "exciton - exciton interaction affects exciton photoluminescence , breaks the symmetry between excitons with different spin components , contributes to depolarization of the exciton gas , and controls spin and momentum relaxation in the exciton system .",
    "a thorough investigation of exciton - exciton interaction is crucial for understanding of a number of experimental results in exciton gas .",
    "blue shift of the exciton luminescence line with growing exciton density was reported in single quantum wells @xcite , multiple quantum wells@xcite and coupled quantum wells where electrons and holes are spatially separated @xcite .",
    "the blue shift is attributed to the net exciton - exciton repulsion interaction in quantum wells @xcite .",
    "other interesting interaction induced phenomena are related to exciton spin .",
    "here we use the term spin for the projection of the total angular momentum of the exciton to the direction perpendicular to quantum well plane ( the growth direction ) . in quantum wells size quantization leads to an energy separation between heavy and light holes .",
    "therefore one can treat the ground state exciton as a bound state of a conduction electron with spin @xmath0 and a heavy hole with spin @xmath1 .",
    "so , in the ground state , i.e. , s - state exciton , the spin can take the values @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "total momentum conservation allows only states with spin projection @xmath2 to be optically active in single photon experiments .",
    "spin + 1 and spin -1 excitons can be created independently by pumping circular polarized light . a spontaneous energy splitting between the two different components of spin - polarized exciton gas in zero magnetic field",
    "was observed in multiple quantum wells @xcite and in coupled quantum wells @xcite .",
    "the splitting increased with the exciton density and decreased with the separation of the electron and hole induced by external electric field in coupled quantum wells .",
    "the splitting was explained by the exciton - exciton exchange interactions @xcite .    at high exciton densities",
    "the decay of the exciton luminescence can not be characterized by one decay time .",
    "initially the decay is very fast and then it is followed by a slower relaxation.@xcite similar results were obtained for the decay of luminescence polarization.@xcite a very careful analysis of the luminescence intensity and polarization by baylac , amand _",
    "et al_.@xcite and two - pulse experiments performed by le jeune _ et al_.@xcite proved that the short decay time can be explained only by exciton - exciton scattering .",
    "in dense exciton gas exciton - exciton scattering can also be the leading mechanism of momentum relaxation .",
    "@xcite    the active investigation of exciton - exciton interaction and many new experimental results makes it difficult to overestimate the importance of theoretical description of this interaction .",
    "such a description , however , encounters significant difficulties even when the exciton density is small and the interaction between excitons could be considered with the help of perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , let us consider two electron - hole pairs ( e1,h1 ) and ( e2,h2 ) bound in excitons .",
    "one could expect that the coulomb interaction within pairs ( i.e. , the interaction between e1 and h1 and the interaction between e2 and h2 ) has to be taken into account exactly because it provides bound states , while the coulomb interaction between particles belonging to different excitons ( e.g. , the interaction between e1 and h2 and the interaction between e2 and h1 ) can be considered as a perturbation .",
    "however , due to electron - electron and hole - hole exchange it is impossible to say if bound pairs are really ( e1,h1 ) and ( e2,h2 ) or ( e1,h2 ) and ( e2,h1 ) .",
    "for this reason it is not clear what part of the coulomb interaction is the interaction between excitons and can be considered as a perturbation .",
    "a few approaches have been developed which formally related the gas of electron - hole pairs to a bose gas and avoided such difficulty .",
    "hanamura@xcite made use of the usui transformation , @xcite that makes a correspondence between the space of fermion pairs and a `` hypothetical '' boson space .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian still contained fermi operators . to eliminate them the commutators of this hamiltonian with bose operators averaged over the ground state of the fermion system",
    "were declared to be equal to the commutators of the target boson hamiltonian with bose operators .",
    "the harmonic part of the resulting boson hamiltonian immediately led to the known exciton states .",
    "thus , it was natural to assume that the anharmonic part describes exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "haug and schmitt - rink@xcite ( see also ref . ) modified this approach introducing creation and annihilation operators as linear combinations of pairs of fermi operators .",
    "commutation relations of new operators are different from those of bose operators by terms proportional to the density of bosons .",
    "the coefficients of the linear combination were found from a variation principle and appeared to be single - exciton wave functions corrected by interactions between bosons .",
    "et al_.@xcite used another approach where they represented wave functions of the electron - hole plasma as linear combinations of products of single - exciton wave functions . then again",
    "a variational principle was used to find the single - exciton wave function . in all these works",
    "the exciton - exciton interaction was calculated in the leading order in the exciton density .    in this paper",
    "we develop a theory of exciton - exciton interaction in quantum wells which is free of a formal definition of exciton creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we do not use a variational method , the accuracy of which is difficult to control .",
    "the physical basis to our approach is that we consider a system of equal number of electrons and holes at low enough temperature and low density , when all the particles are bound in excitons .",
    "if the density is not small then excitons overlap and the coulomb interaction between particles of different excitons is of the same order as the electron - hole interaction within one exciton . in such a case",
    "the identity of excitons is lost and the electron - hole plasma can hardly be considered as gas of excitons .",
    "if the other limitation , i.e. , small kinetic energy of excitons is not met then excitons can be ionized and the system can not be described as the gas of excitons only .",
    "experimentally small exciton kinetic energy is achieved by resonant excitation at lattice temperature much lower than the binding energy @xcite .",
    "technically our approach resembles that of stolz _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "however , we do nt rely on a variational principle but use a systematic expansion in small exciton density .",
    "finally , we arrive at an expression for the second quantized exciton hamiltonian with coefficients that are expressed in terms of the free single - exciton wave function . this function , and",
    "so the coefficients , strongly depend on the geometry of the heterostructure .",
    "we use the exciton hamiltonian for the calculation of the blue shift of the exciton luminescence line and the energy splitting between excitons with different spin projection .",
    "these phenomena are described by hamiltonian matrix elements which are diagonal with respect to occupation numbers of exciton states .",
    "off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian describe exciton - exciton scattering .",
    "we use them to write down the bolzmann equation for the excitons and estimate the relaxation time in the exciton gas . for numerical calculation of the coefficients of the hamiltonian",
    "we use the variational single - exciton wave function that we suggested earlier @xcite .",
    "we are not trying to reach an exact numerical matching of our theory with experiments .",
    "this would require an accurate calculation of the single - exciton wave function for different geometries .",
    "our goal is rather to explain semi - quantitatively ( i.e. , with an accuracy better than the order of magnitude ) as many experiments as possible . in other words",
    ", we are trying to show that our theory is able to describe all so far detected phenomena in the exciton gas of a small density which are related to exciton - exciton scattering .",
    "the structure of the paper reflects the specifics of the problem .",
    "we consider electrons and holes confined in quantum wells .",
    "their motion in the growth direction is strongly quantized ( we assume that only the ground electron and hole states are occupied ) and the problem is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "so , in the next section we reduce the three - dimensional ( 3d ) hamiltonian of electrons and holes to a 2d one . in sec .",
    "[ deh ] we present the main assumptions of our approach and give the derivation of the exciton hamiltonian .",
    "some cumbersome details of the derivation are transferred to appendices . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfa ] we calculate the blue shift of the exciton luminescence line and the energy splitting of excitons with opposite spins . in sec .",
    "[ esr ] we estimate the exciton - exciton relaxation time with the help of the bolzmann equation .",
    "we discuss our results and compare them to experiments in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "due to a strong quantization of the electron and hole motion in the growth direction the dynamics of electrons and holes is essentially two - dimensional . for this reason excitons in quantum wells",
    "sometimes are considered as purely 2d@xcite . in this approximation , however , it is impossible to describe effects of the geometrical parameters of quantum wells on the exciton binding energy and their interaction .",
    "so we use a more realistic model which takes into account the geometry of the heterostructure .    in quantum wells , light and heavy holes",
    "are split off in energy .",
    "we consider only heavy holes , assuming that the splitting is much larger than kinetic energies of all involved particles and the interaction between them .",
    "therefore , light hole states are not occupied and the hamiltonian of the plasma of @xmath4 electrons and @xmath4 heavy holes in quantum wells is @xmath5 \\label{eq : hehg.1 } \\\\ & + &      \\sum_{ij } u_{eh}(|\\vec{r}_{ei } - \\vec{r}_{hj}| , z_{ei } , z_{hj } ) +      { 1 \\over 2 } \\sum_{ij }    \\left [      u_{ee}(|\\vec{r}_{ei } - \\vec{r}_{ej}| , z_{ei } , z_{ej } ) +      u_{hh}(|\\vec{r}_{hi } - \\vec{r}_{hj}| , z_{hi } , z_{hj } )                              \\right ] \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are electron coordinates in the quantum well plane and in the growth direction respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the same for holes ,    @xmath10    [ eq : hehg.2 ]    are the operators of the electron and hole kinetic energy , @xmath11 is the electron mass , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in - plane and perpendicular hole effective masses , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the derivatives with respect to in - plane coordinates of electron and hole , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the heterostructure potentials that confine electrons and holes in quantum wells , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the electron - hole , electron - electron , and hole - hole coulomb interaction energies respectively",
    ". if the difference between dielectric constants in wells and barriers is negligible then    @xmath21    [ eq : hehg.3 ]    where @xmath22 is the dielectric constant .",
    "the method that we develop can be applied to a single quantum well or to coupled quantum wells with all possible well and barrier widths . in this paper",
    "we use it only for coupled quantum wells where electrons and holes are spatially separated .",
    "we neglect the electron - hole exchange@xcite which is very small in general @xcite and is further reduced in coupled quantum wells due to the smaller electron - hole wave function overlap .",
    "we also neglect the reduced symmetry of quantum well - barrier interfaces since this effect is very small.@xcite as a result , hamiltonian ( [ eq : hehg.1 ] ) does not depend on electron and hole spins .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hehg.1 ] ) contains an information about particle confinement in quantum wells which makes the study of in - plane states of the particles more difficult .",
    "fortunately , in the most interesting cases the in - plane motion can be separated and the problem is simplified .",
    "typically the interaction energy between the lowest level in a quantum well and the first excited one ( a few tens of mev or even larger ) is much larger than coulomb interaction between particles ( a few mev ) .",
    "for this reason at low enough temperature particles are confined at the lowest quantization level . a distortion of the wave functions caused by an admixture with the next level due to coulomb interaction between the particles can be neglected .",
    "in such a case @xmath23-dependence of electron and hole wave functions is described by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , which satisfy the equations    @xmath26    [ eq : hehg.4 ]    here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the electron and hole confinement energies respectively .",
    "the wave function of the gas is a product of all single particles wave functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 and a many - particle wave function describing the in - plane state .",
    "the hamiltonian that controls the in - plane dynamics of the gas is obtained from the hamiltonian , ( [ eq : hehg.1 ] ) , by averaging with the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and has the form @xmath31 \\ , \\label{eq : hehg.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 all details of the derivation of 2d hamiltonian , ( [ eq : hehg.5 ] ) , from 3d one , ( [ eq : hehg.1 ] ) , in the case of two particles are given in ref .. the derivation of many particle hamiltonian can be done in the same way .    thus to study electron - hole gas confined in quantum wells it is enough to consider only a 2d problem described by hamiltonian , ( [ eq : hehg.5 ] ) .",
    "in this section we derive the 2d hamiltonian of exciton gas starting from the 2d hamiltonian of electrons and holes , eq . ( [ eq : hehg.5 ] ) .",
    "we begin this derivation with a discussion of the necessary conditions for considering the electron - hole gas as exciton gas .    not in any state",
    "the electron - hole gas can be represented as a gas of excitons . to make this possible , two conditions are necessary .",
    "the first one is a small enough concentration of electrons and holes , @xmath33 . under this condition",
    "all electrons and holes can be bound in excitons and the excitons are far from each other .",
    "that is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the exciton radius .",
    "if this condition is not met then excitons overlap and the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes of different excitons becomes of the order of the interaction within one exciton .",
    "in such a case it is impossible to identify excitons , and the electron - hole plasma hardly can be described as a gas of excitons .",
    "the other condition is that typical exciton kinetic energy is much smaller than the absolute value of the exciton binding energy , @xmath36 , @xmath37 here @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the exciton wave vector and the exciton mass respectively .",
    "if this condition is not met then as a result of collisions between excitons they can be excited from the ground state or even be ionized into free electrons and holes .",
    "then it is necessary to consider excitons interacting with each other and with free electrons and holes.@xcite we are not going to consider this case . strictly speaking",
    ", the accurate condition for ground state excitons contains the energy separation between the ground state and the first excited state of exciton in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.2 ] ) .",
    "but this difference is of the order of @xmath36 and we can use eq . ( [ eq : deh.2 ] ) as it is .    to derive the exciton hamiltonian",
    "we construct a basis for the space of all electron - hole states from products of single exciton wave functions . under the conditions ( [ eq : deh.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : deh.2 ] ) we expect that only the ground state exciton wave function is important .",
    "so of all matrix elements of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hehg.5 ] ) only the elements between the states constructed of these functions should be kept .",
    "such a program in an accurate form is carried out in sec .",
    "[ sec : deh.rh ] , where we show how to calculate all matrix elements of the exciton hamiltonian .",
    "due to inequality ( [ eq : deh.1 ] ) some of these matrix elements are small .",
    "namely , matrix elements describing triple and higher order interaction between excitons are proportional to higher power of the exciton concentration than matrix elements describing pair interaction , and we neglect them . for the calculation of the pair interaction matrix elements",
    "it is enough to consider the system of only two excitons .",
    "this calculation is performed in sec .",
    "[ sec : deh.2eh ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ deh.heg ] , we use these matrix elements to write down the hamiltonian of the exciton gas in the second quantized form .",
    "the starting point of our derivation is the hamiltonian of many electrons and holes , ( [ eq : hehg.5 ] ) .",
    "the general idea of the derivation is that we reduce the space of all electron - hole states to the subspace of ground state excitons states only , and project the hamiltonian to this subspace .",
    "the first step in this direction is the construction of a basis in which this subspace can be separated .",
    "we construct such a basis of symmetrized products of single exciton wave functions .",
    "single exciton wave functions are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath40 since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : deh.rh.3 ] ) is independent on electron and hole spins , a single exciton wave function can be written as @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the eigenfunction of hamiltonian , ( [ eq : deh.rh.3 ] ) , and the spin wave function , @xmath43 can be represented as the product of the electron and hole spin functions , @xmath44 .",
    "the projection of electron and hole spins to @xmath23-direction can take the values @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "the exciton spin projection to the same direction is @xmath47 and it can take the values @xmath48 .",
    "the spin variables , @xmath49 , take the same values .",
    "there is one to one correspondence between the set of electron and hole spins and the exciton spin , i.e. , each exciton spin corresponds to a single combination of electron and hole spins .",
    "the in - plane exciton wave function is @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the exciton center of mass coordinate , @xmath52 is the exciton mass , @xmath53 is the normalization area , and the function , @xmath54 is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the reduced mass .",
    "the functions @xmath57 form a complete basis for electron - hole pair states .",
    "that means that a complete basis for the gas consisting of @xmath4 electrons and @xmath4 holes can be constructed of these functions .",
    "this basis consists of correctly symmetrized products of single exciton functions,@xcite @xmath58 here @xmath59 stands for the set of quantum numbers @xmath60 , @xmath61 , the summation is carried out over all transpositions of electrons and holes , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the parity of a transposition .",
    "basis ( [ eq : deh.rh.9 ] ) is very convenient for our purpose because it easily allows us to separate the subspace of wave functions containing only ground state excitons .",
    "this subspace contains those @xmath65 in which all @xmath66 correspond to the ground state .",
    "we enumerate this subspace as 1 and the subspace of functions containing at least one excited exciton as 2 .",
    "it is necessary to note that the functions @xmath65 are not orthogonal , in spite of the orthogonality of the single exciton functions @xmath67.@xcite let us , for instance , consider the integral of the product of two functions @xmath65 and @xmath68 which differ by only one of all the quantum numbers @xmath59 , e.g. , @xmath69 in the first function is replaced by @xmath70 in the second one . comparing these two wave functions",
    "we see that for each term in the sum ( [ eq : deh.rh.9 ] ) of one wave function there are terms in the sum of the other that differ by exchange of pairs of electrons and holes in such a way that the identity of excitons is not violated [ e.g. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the integrals of the products of these terms equal zero because of the orthogonality of single exciton wave functions .",
    "but there are also terms that differ by a transposition of electrons or holes which violates the exciton identity , e.g. , @xmath71 and @xmath73 .",
    "the integral of the product of these terms is nonzero .",
    "from the definition of the single exciton wave functions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.6 ] ) , we see that this integral , contains the factor @xmath74 .    if functions @xmath65 and @xmath68 differ by more than just one value of @xmath59 or the transposition mixes more than a pair of excitons , the integral of @xmath75 contains the factor of @xmath74 to a higher power",
    "eventually , in the calculation of observable quantities each factor of @xmath76 is accompanied by a sum over occupied states of the system which gives the factor of @xmath4 . so that the nonorthogonality of the basis is characterized by the parameter @xmath77 .    the basis ( [ eq : deh.rh.9 ] ) is not normalized .",
    "the normalization integral of any of the basis functions , @xmath78 , contains integrals of the same type of exchange that leads to the nonorthogonality .",
    "thus this integral is different from unity by terms of the order of @xmath77 .",
    "after the characterization of the basis ( [ eq : deh.rh.9 ] ) we begin the derivation of the exciton hamiltonian .",
    "we write down the schrdinger equation for the gas of @xmath4 electrons and @xmath4 holes , @xmath79 , in the matrix form in basis ( [ eq : deh.rh.9 ] ) . to do this we need to represent the eigenfunction @xmath80 as an expansion in the functions @xmath65 , and to obtain equations for the coefficients of this expansion .",
    "for this purpose we multiply the schrdinger equation by the functions complex conjugated to @xmath65 and integrate over all variables . to write down the result in the matrix form",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath81 for the column of the expansion coefficients of the basis function belonging to subspace 1 ( only ground state excitons ) and the notation @xmath82 for the column of the expansion coefficients of the basis function belonging to subspace 2 ( including also excited states ) .",
    "then the matrix equation takes the form    @xmath83    [ eq : deh.rh.10 ]    where @xmath84 are the matrices with elements @xmath85 and @xmath86 are matrices with elements @xmath87 , where @xmath65 and @xmath68 belong to @xmath88 and @xmath89 subspaces respectively .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.10b ] ) in order to express @xmath82 in @xmath81 , substitute the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.10a ] ) and come up with the equation @xmath90 where the effect of excited states is described by @xmath91 although eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.11 ] ) contains only @xmath81 it does not have the form of the schrdinger equation because @xmath92 is a nonlinear function of the energy @xmath93 .",
    "the reason is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.11 ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.10 ] ) and describes the general situation , where electrons and holes can occupy excited states . to describe a system where all electrons and holes are bound in ground state excitons",
    "we make use of the small parameters ( [ eq : deh.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : deh.2 ] ) .      here",
    "we start from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.11 ] ) and ( [ eq : deh.rh.12 ] ) , neglect small terms and obtain the hamiltonian and the schrdinger equation for the exciton gas .",
    "first we note that @xmath94 and @xmath95 contain terms of different order in @xmath74 .",
    "the estimate of both @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be done in the same way .",
    "the larger the overlap between @xmath65 and @xmath68 , the larger the matrix element @xmath85 is . as we explained above ,",
    "matrix elements between states that differ by a transposition of two electrons or two holes contain the factor @xmath74 and describe two - exciton interaction in @xmath95 .",
    "matrix elements between the states that differ by a transposition of three electrons or three holes , e.g. @xmath96 and @xmath97 , contain @xmath98 .",
    "in @xmath95 they describe a triple exciton interaction that is not reduced to pair interaction .",
    "we neglect such and other high order terms both in @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath99 , and @xmath100 are nonzero only because of the nonorthogonality of basis functions ( [ eq : deh.rh.9 ] ) . as we showed above @xmath101 when @xmath102 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath103 and @xmath104 contain the same parameter .",
    "to prove this , let us examine the largest matrix elements of @xmath105 .",
    "the maximal overlap between subspace 1 and subspace 2 is achieved when the state from subspace 2 is such that all electrons and holes are bound in ground state excitons except from one pair which is bound in an excited exciton state . from the orthogonality of single exciton wave functions ( [ eq : deh.rh.4 ] ) with different @xmath66 it follows that there are only two kinds of non vanishing terms .",

    "the second kind are the terms where the identity of the exciton is violated .",
    "we gave an example for those terms when we discussed the nonorthogonality and saw that they contain the small parameter @xmath110 .",
    "other non - vanishing terms , e.g. for states with smaller overlap between subspace 1 and subspace 2 contain higher powers of @xmath74 .    from the above arguments we see that the matrix @xmath92 contains the small parameter @xmath74 coming from @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath105 and @xmath104 .",
    "for this reason , in the leading order , all other contributions to @xmath92 containing this small parameter can be neglected . in particular , in the summation over intermediate states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh.rh.12 ] ) we consider only diagonal terms of @xmath111 , and in these terms neglect the interaction between excitons .",

    "if this inequality is not satisfied then the energy of the ground state excitons @xmath93 can be close to @xmath114 due to the high ground state exciton kinetic energy .",
    "in such a case some matrix elements of @xmath115 contain a small denominator and become anomalously large .",

    "the radius of highly excited exciton states can be of the order of the distance between different excitons and the interaction between excitons in this case is of the order of the electron - hole interaction within the same exciton . however , such highly excited states are very close to states of free electrons and holes where coulomb interaction can be neglected compared to the kinetic energy .",
