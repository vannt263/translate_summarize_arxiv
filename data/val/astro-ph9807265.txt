    "among all spectral bands , the ultraviolet has long been a neglected region , in which we hardly have a good idea of how the sky looks like .",
    "this is despite the fact that in the uv there is a distinct advantage of small payloads : first , the sky is very dark , thus detection of faint objects does not compete against an enhanced background ( oconnell 1987 ) ; second , the telescope construction techniques are very similar ( at least longward of @xmath070 nm ) to those used for optical astronomy .",
    "this apparent neglect is likely to change in the foreseeable future .",
    "another factor , which presumably acted against the initiation of new sky surveys in the uv , was the argument that not much can be learned about the universe from new uv sky surveys .",
    "after all , it was said , we can infer about the appearance of the uv sky from a good data base in the optical .",
    "i shall show later that this is only approximately correct .",
    "the availability of a mechanism which allows one to predict the appearance of the uv sky is a necessary ingredient in the detection of outstanding sources , which may indicate the presence of new physical phenomena .",
    "the short astronomical history of our knowledge of the uv sky can be divided into two eras , the first from the dawn of uv astronomy until the flight of td-1 and the second since the availability of the td-1 all - sky survey until today .",
    "unfortunately , very little was accomplished in terms of general sky surveys during this second era .",
    "we still await results from a major , modern and sensitive uv all - sky survey , which hopefully will be performed in the early 2000 s .    likewise",
    ", the uv domain may be divided into the `` regular '' ultraviolet , that is , the segment from just shortward of the spectral region observable from high ground - based observatories ( @xmath0320 nm ) to just below the lyman break at @xmath090 nm , and the region from the lyman break to the fuzzy beginning of the x - ray domain .",
    "this short wavelength limit may be arbitrarily defined as @xmath06 nm ( @xmath1200 ev ) .",
    "i shall call the first segment `` the uv '' and the second the `` extreme uv '' ( euv ) bands . as shall be shown below , the observational techniques used in the euv band are more similar to those in x - ray astronomy , whereas the uv is more like the optical .",
    "sometimes , the uv region as defined here is separated into the near - uv and far - uv segments ; the separation is at @xmath0200 nm .",
    "although only few missions performed full sky surveys in the uv or euv , a large number of instruments scanned or imaged restricted sky areas . those provided partial , or very partial , information about the deeper uv sky . by thorough examination of their results",
    "one may form an idea on what could be expected from a full sky survey to a similar depth . a review of uv imaging experiments and their results , updated to 1990 ,",
    "was given by oconnell ( 1991 ) .",
    "a few uv imaging experiments were described and compared by rifatto ( 1995 ) , with the aim of understanding galaxy uv emission .    in general , the sources of uv and euv radiation can be either point or diffuse . a summary list of diverse sources , with the approximate order of importance in contribution , is shown below as table 1 , which is derived from the similar table of gondhalekar ( 1990 ) .",
    "a note of caution should be mentioned here : the relevance of the importance of various contributions to the background is for broad - band measurements . in special circumstances , _",
    "e.g. , _ for narrow - band or spectroscopic observations , line emission in the euv domain may become the dominant contributor .",
    ".sources of uv and euv radiation [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the information about galaxies is very sparse and we still lack a large sample of a few 1000 s galaxies , from which to perform good statistical studies .    significant information on selected objects , mainly on stellar populations and the nature of the ism , was obtained from iue spectra ( oconnell 1992 ) .",
    "similar observational data , combining uv with optical and near - ir spectrophotometry through matched apertures , was recently used to derive template spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for various types of galaxies ( storchi - bergmann _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; mcquade _ et al .",
    "a combination of iue observations and data from other uv imaging missions was used to extract `` total '' uv information on galaxies ( longo 1991 ; rifatto 1995a , 1995b ) .",
    "there is hope to derive the star - forming histories of galaxies through a combination of data from the uv to the near - ir , in the manner of the storchi - bergmann _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) templates",
    ". however , we have recently shown ( almoznino & brosch 1997a , 1997b ) that such decompositions are not unique , at least for a sample of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) . in order to account for recent star - formation bursts , it is necessary to include information about the ionizing continuum ; as the ism in the milky way and in the target object prevents direct observation of the ionizing continuum , this can be derived from h@xmath2 observations under simplifying assumptions .",
    "uv data collected by iue or uit are usually at @xmath3140 nm .",
    "this region contains mainly radiation from a - type stars and requires extrapolation of the stellar population to earlier types , to account for lyman continuum photons .    to understand large populations of galaxies , in terms of stellar populations and star formation histories , it is impractical to rely only on the detailed modeling of spectral features in the optical region",
    "one should combine information from many spectral bands , covering a spectral region as wide as possible .    in the absence of very deep uv surveys in more than a single spectral band , such as those expected to result from the uit exposures , our information about a significant number of galaxies originates from the scap-2000 ( donas _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) and foca ( milliard _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) measurements .",
    "these consist of integrated photometry at 200 nm of a few hundred galaxies . in the 200 nm band and in the brightness range 16.5 - 18.5 galaxies apparently dominate the source counts .",
    "the corresponding blue magnitudes of these galaxies are b=1820 and their typical color index is @xmath4\\approx-$]1.5 . comparing this index with the template spectra of kinney _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , the foca galaxies fit the sb2 template , _",
    "i.e. , _ a slightly reddened starburst galaxy .    the galaxy counts from the foca flights originate from the analysis of three high latitude fields covering about 4.5 square degrees , which include galaxy or globular clusters ( m3 , abell 2111 , and sa 57 , which contains a few coma cluster galaxies ) .",
    "( 1992 ) indicate negligible contamination of their galaxy counts by either uv stars or cluster galaxies . in order to reproduce the observed galaxy density distribution ,",
    "armand and milliard ( 1994 ) find that a simple transformation to the uv of the known visible galaxy counts is not sufficient .",
    "they require a larger contribution by star - forming galaxies in the recent past , such as late - type spirals or blue dwarf galaxies .",
    "in the field of a2111 , milliard _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 , private communication ) find that the uv galaxies are mostly in the foreground or the background of the cluster , ranging as far as a redshift of 0.68 .",
    "note that the lyman break in the rest frame of a distant galaxy will enter the foca window only at z@xmath11.3 .",
    "spectra of some of these optically faint galaxies reveal narrow emission lines , justifying a link with star - forming galaxies",
    ". a larger fraction of starforming galaxies at high z was claimed also from hst data , _",
    "i.e. , _ the hdf or the mds",
    ". however , note that giavalisco _",
    "( 1996 ) claim that not all hst faint galaxies are starbursts or peculiar galaxies ; being observed at uv wavelengths in their rest frame their morphological appearance is later than would be determined from optical studies .    using the `` field '' galaxy luminosity function in the uv , derived by deharveng _",
    "( 1994 ) from the smooth linking of the projected density of uv galaxies from the faust and foca counts , it appears that : @xmath5 there is a faster increase in the number density of galaxies at faint uv magnitudes than it is for stars .",
    "the uit results , derived from the analysis of the 48 independent pointings from the astro-1 mission , indicate that the majority of uv sources recorded by this instrument are stars ( smith _ et al .",
    "this is at odds with the analysis of milliard _",
    "one possible explanation could be the longer wavelength response of uit ; most of the analyzed images were taken through the a1 filter .",
    "this filter has a significant color term because of its considerable width , thus its effective central wavelength is 230 nm for early - type stars and about 280 nm for g stars . in contrast , the foca bandpass is much narrower and better defined .",
    "the difference in the amount of recorded stars could then be the result of uit seeing more late - type stars , to which foca would be `` blind '' .",
    "to check this possibility , we calculated models of stellar densities patterned after those of brosch ( 1991 ) , with the difference that the present models were calculated for the uit a1 band .",
    "specifically , we derived an optical - to - uv transformation based on iue spectra convolved with the a1 filter response , shown in fig . 6 , calculated the cumulative stellar densities in the direction of uit targets , and compared the expected and the measured source counts and properties , in the deepest uit exposures ( all with the a1 filter and with 600 sec exposure or longer )",
    ". we found that we can reproduce the total counts , the distribution of star counts by magnitude bins , and the [ uit  v ] color distribution with a model cutoff at v@xmath118 .",
    "results for the uit field centered at ( 06:22 ; 13:03 ) are shown in figures 7 and 8 , and the error bars on the experimental points originate from an assumption of poisson statistics in the number counts .",
    "it follows that uit could indeed have detected mostly stars , and that the galaxy model in brosch ( 1991 ) , with its subsequent modifications and transformation to the uit a1 band , reproduces faithfully the observed stellar distribution .",
    "one must be wary of the uv ",
    "v colors quoted in the uit catalog ; the v magnitude is derived in many cases from the `` quick - v '' magnitude in the hst guide star catalog , which may be significantly off ( 0.15 mag=1@xmath6 for objects near the plate center calibrating sequences , going as high as 0.30 mag=1@xmath6 for objects far from the sequence : russell _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) .",
    "another comparison of uit and foca performance is possible using the studies of m51 by both instruments ( bersier _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , petit _",
    "_ 1996 for foca ; hill _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 for uit ) .",
    "i measured the integrated flux of 22 hii regions in m51 on the calibrated foca image ( kindly provided by d. bersier ) , out of the 28 identified in the uit b1 image of hill _",
    "the comparison is shown in figure 9 .",
    "in general , the m@xmath7 and the m@xmath8 magnitudes correlate well .",
    "there is no significant calibration offset between uit and foca , at least in this image , and the hii regions do not show strong reddening effects between 152 nm and 200 nm .",
    "this nice correspondence demonstrates fully the advantage of a balloon - borne uv survey telescope , at a fraction of the cost of uit or of other orbital telescopes ( see below ) .",
    "one missing ingredient to a fuller model of the sky consists of a proper representation of galaxies and agns / qsos .",
    "the latter , in particular , are uv - bright objects .",
    "their detection in deep uv surveys should be relatively easy .",
    "moreover , their spectral energy distribution is very different from that of stars , thus using uv and optical colors it is possible to discriminate them from the foreground stars .",
    "the claim by the foca group of a large contribution of uv galaxies is supported by theoretical arguments requiring a fast - evolving population of perhaps dwarf galaxies for z=0.2 - 1.0 , in order to explain the faint source counts in other spectral domains ( ellis 1997 ) . a similar possibility , that @xmath060 of the almost star - like blue objects in the hubble deep field are distant extragalactic sources , has been proposed by mndez ( 1996 ) .",
    "one possibility could be that these sources are distant blue dwarf galaxies or starbursting galaxies , which are smaller than their present - day counterparts .",
    "this is apparently confirmed by the keck spectra of some of these objects , though the inferred star formation activity in these objects appears much higher than in local starbursts ( _ e.g. , _",
    "guzman 1997 ) .",
    "studies by uit and faust emphasize the relative importance of the dust in understanding the uv emission .",
    "bilenko ( 1995 ) analyzed the td-1 catalog and a version of the hipparcos input catalog transformed to the td-1 band with information derived from iue spectra of different types of stars .",
    "they showed that the uv exinction is very patchy , with very different values of extinction per kpc on scales smaller than 10@xmath9 .",
    "tovmassian _ et al . _",
    "( 1996b ) used the results of glazar observations of a 12 degrees@xmath10 area in crux , to establish that the distribution of ism dust is very patchy , with most of the space between stellar associations being relatively free of dust .",
    "they did not attempt to delimit better the location of dust clouds in 3d space , because of the rather sparse sky coverage of the glazar stars .",
    "much of our present understanding of the structure of the local ism comes from studies in the euv range .",
    "in particular , the various euve catalogs ( bowyer _ et al . _ 1994 , 1996 ; lampton _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) confirm the previously known features of the local ism ( a `` tunnel '' to cma with very low hi column density to  200 pc . and close to the galactic plane first identified by gry ( 1985 ) from the copernicus data , a cavity connected with the gum nebula in vela , a shorter 100 pc .",
    "tunnel to 36 lynx , and the very clear region in the direction of the lockman hole ) .",
    "it is clear that the present euv catalogs are not deep enough to reveal finer , or deeper details .",
    "the new uit study of m51 shows that @xmath11 changes with decreasing metallicity ( or galactocentric distance ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the finding by kiszkurno - koziej & lequeux ( 1987 ) , that the extinction law in the milky way changes with distance away from the galactic plane .",
    "the authors find that the h@xmath2 flux is depleted in the inner regions of m51 ; this they interpret as increased lyman continuum extinction in the inner parts of m51 .",
    "the accurate measurement of the uv sky background ( uvb ) , with the expectation that it could put meaningful cosmological limits , has been the goal of many rocket , orbital , and deep space experiments .",
    "many observational results were summarized in reviews by henry ( 1982 ) , bowyer ( 1990 ) , bowyer ( 1991 ) , and henry ( 1991 ) .",
    "it is worth noting the many pitfalls of accurate uv background measurements : sensitivity to instrumental dark current , atmospheric emissions at low orbital and rocket altitudes , _ etc .",
    "_ leinert ( 1998 ) discuss observations and interpretation relevant to the uv and euv backgrounds in a general discussion of the sky background in many wavelengths .",
    "bowyer ( 1991 ) separates the various origins of the diffuse uvb into `` galactic '' and `` high latitude '' .",
    "the latter forms an @xmath0uniform pedestal , onto which the galactic component is added in various amounts depending on the direction of observation .",
    "the `` galactic '' component can be @xmath0one order of magnitude more intense than the `` high latitude '' one .",
    "most of this intensity is probably from light scattered off dust particles in the ism , and the rest is from the gaseous component of the ism ( hii two photon emission and h@xmath12 fluorescense in molecular clouds ) .",
    "the majority of the `` high latitude '' component is probably also galactic , originating from light scattering off dust clouds at high galactic latitude .",
    "an analysis of the diffuse uv emission ( murthy & henry 1995 ) indicates that the extragalactic component of the uv background can be at most 100 - 400 photon units . whenever the column density of hi is larger than 2 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , the main contributor to the uvb originates from dust - scattered starlight .",
    "the low levels of the extragalactic component are produced probably by the integrated light of galaxies ( armand _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , or the integrated light of the milky way scattered off dust grains in the galactic halo ( hurwitz _ et al .",
    "even the lyman @xmath2 clouds in intergalactic space may contribute , through their recombination radiation ( henry 1991 ) .",
    "the confirmation that most uvb originates from dust - scattered light was obtained by sasseen _",
    "( 1995 ) and sasseen & deharveng ( 1996 ) .",
    "_ showed that the spatial power spectrum of the diffuse uvb on faust images is consistent in spectral index and amplitude ratio with the iras 100 @xmath15 m signal in the same sky areas , while sasseen & deharveng found that the uv background correlates with the fir measurements of cobe / dirbe .",
    "galactic cirrus clouds apparently scatter back significant fuv radiation from the milky way ; harkala ( 1995 ) found such uv emission with faust from the direction of a dark cloud detected at 100 @xmath15 m by iras .",
    "the low levels of uv background , away from orbital and galactic contaminants , have been confirmed by an analysis of 489 uit images from the astro-1 flight ( waller _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . after correcting for orbital background and zodiacal light , and after accounting for scattered galactic light by ism cirrus clouds ( through the iras 100 micron emission )",
    ", the authors extrapolated the uv - to - fir correlation to negligible fir emission to find that the extragalactic ( cosmic ) uv background must be 200@xmath16100 count units .",
    "note one effect in all shuttle - based experiments , which was not accounted for in the uit uvb analysis ; the influence of background light produced by the shuttle attitude jets firing . during the faust flight this",
    "was observed as an enhanced background in the photon stream , which was @xmath17 higher than the level from all other sources ( sasseen 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "as this is diffuse light , the influence is clearly dependent on the solid angle of observation and on the size of the aperture .",
    "for uit , this should have resulted in a level @xmath02.5% that of faust . because of this , the minimal uvb levels estimated by waller _",
    "( 1995 ) must be considered upper limits .",
    "the shorter wavelength background has been observed by _",
    "e.g. , _ holberg ( 1986 ) with the voyager uvs , reaching as far down as 50 nm",
    ". the uv range shortward of ly@xmath2 but longward of the lyman break was studied from an integrated data set of all the voyager uvs observations ( murthy _ et al .",
    "they identified 272 uvs observations of which @xmath050% have intensities under 100 count units .",
    "in particular , note the observations on the north galactic pole region , which give consistently a zero background level ( upper limit 100 c.u . , 1@xmath6-to be revised ) .",
    "et al . _ concluded , after accounting for the scattered light in the ly@xmath2 and ly@xmath18 line wings and for the radiation - induced background from the radio - isotope thermal generator on - board the voyager spacecrafts , that the minimal sky background between 91.2 nm and 115 nm is 0@xmath16100 c.u .",
    "( 1@xmath6 ) .",
    "this is , by far , the lowest value of any extragalactic uvb component , and the formal 1@xmath6 upper limit is the value plotted in fig .",
    "its implication is that in the nearby universe , to z@xmath10.2 , there is only a very small contribution of photons with @xmath3912 .",
    "it is also clear that galaxies at any redshift are rather opaque to lyman continuum photons ; these could contribute in the voyager band from any ( reasonable ) redshift .",
    "it is possible to evaluate the level of the `` true '' extragalactic background which would be detected by instruments with moderate angular resolution , from the foca galaxy counts at 200 nm ( milliard _ et al .",
    "their actual galaxy counts , for 15.0@xmath1918.5 , give ( when extrapolated to m@xmath7=20.0 ) a contribution of @xmath0100 c.u.s already from the uv - detected galaxies .",
    "note that such faint objects would hardly be detectable in the uit exposures .",
    "armand ( 1994 ) used the foca counts at 200 nm , with a limiting magnitude of 18.5 , to calculate the contribution to the uv background from galaxies .",
    "they estimated that 40130 c.u .",
    "can be due to galaxies .",
    "a similar analysis by martin ( 1997 ) , using foca galaxies , indicates that at least 25% of the uv background can be due to galaxies .",
    "treyer ( 1997 , private communication ) calculated the expected uv background due to galaxies .",
    "this was done by integrating the present - day 200 nm luminosity function , obtained from the foca observations , to high redshifts . under the assumption of `` no evolution '' , she finds that the diffuse 200 nm surface brightness should be @xmath20 erg s@xmath21 @xmath14 @xmath21 ster@xmath21 , which is equivalent to a surface magnitude @xmath2228 mag arcsec@xmath23 , or @xmath0100 c.u .",
    "this must be considered a lower limit to the background produced by galaxies , as evolutionary considerations , such as having more star formation at high redshifts ( _ e.g. , _",
    "madau 1996 ) , would increase the value of the eub .",
    "any reasonable spectral energy distribution one would invoke for the foca uv galaxies should have a sed rising into the uv , thus even higher flux levels are expected in the 100 nm region than at 200 nm where foca observes .",
    "the voyager results of murthy _",
    "et al . _ are in strong conflict with the assumption that the differential count numbers of uv galaxies extend unmodified to m@xmath24=24 , and in mild conflict ( 2@xmath6 ) with the assumption that they extend to m@xmath24=20 . in the latter case ,",
    "* the entire * extragalactic uvb could be due to unresolved galaxies , leaving no room for hydrogen - recombination photons from the ly@xmath2 clouds , photons scattered off extragalactic dust clouds , etc .",
    "the result of treyer presented above indicates a difficulty with the longer wavelength uvb as well ; the contribution by galaxies accounts for almost the entire uvb measured by uit !    a very deep euve spectroscopic observation of a large region on the ecliptic has recently been reported ( jelinsky _ et al .",
    "it indicates that the only emission lines observed are he i and he ii ( 58.4 , 53.7 , and 30.4 nm ) , which originate from scatted sunlight by the geocoronal and/or interplanetary medium .",
    "the spectrum of the euv background ( fig . 2 in jelinsky _ et al .",
    "_ ) shows a tantalizing continuum , which decreases from 800 c.u . at 16 nm to 100 c.u . at 35 nm",
    "this is probably grating scattering of the 58.4 and 30.4 nm helium lines ( jelinsky , private communication ) .",
    "it is expected that the knowledge of the euv background will improve , as more data from the full ecliptic survey ( 3 10@xmath25 sec exposure ) will be processed .",
    "the lowest value for the euv background originates from a rosat observation ( barber _ et al .",
    "the detection of the shadow cast by the nearby galaxy ngc 55 on the diffuse 250 ev ( 49.6 nm ) background sets a level of the euv background coming from extragalactic sources at 29.4@xmath167.2 kev @xmath14 sec@xmath21 kev@xmath21 ( @xmath19.5@xmath162.3 c.u . at 49.6 nm ) .",
    "the future development of uv astronomy , at least in the context of a full sky survey , has been influenced strongly by the decisions of two major committees in the us .",
    "the first is the `` decade survey of astronomy and astrophysics for the 1990s '' , a committee formed in 1989 by the national research council in the us and chaired by john bahcall to set priorities in an age of diminishing funds .",
    "the workings of the decade survey committee have been described by bahcall ( 1991 ) and the report itself was published in 1991 .",
    "the bahcall committee attempted to prioritize by `` democratic consultation '' throughout the astronomical community .",
    "it is interesting that among the large and moderate programs recommended by the bahcall committee there is only one program in the uv domain ( fuse , see below ) , and the emphasis is on infrared and optical programs .",
    "the sociological trend continued well into the small programs , which the committee did not specify beyond a few examples ; none of these relate to uv astronomy .",
    "the second very influencial committee was charted by the association of universities for research in astronomy ( aura ) with support from nasa , and is called `` hst and beyond '' .",
    "the committee was formed in 1993 , was chaired by alan dressler , and produced its report in 1995 ( dressler 1996 ) .",
    "the dressler committee identified two goals for the space astronomy of the early-21st century : the detailed study of the birth and evolution of normal galaxies , and the detection of earth - like planets around other stars and the search for life on them .",
    "the goals identified by the dressler committee were to be realized by the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) , by a space interferometer , and by extending the operation of the hst beyond 2005 .",
    "in particular , note that hst was to be the major instrument for uv astronomy beyond that date .    the decisions of the bahcall and dressler committees have been adopted by nasa and by the nrc , which control the major funding in the us . in particular ,",
    "nasa headquarters has been restructured into four major `` themes '' , of which the two most related to space astronomy are `` structure and evolution of the universe '' , and `` search for origins '' .",
    "it is possible that these decisions have also had far - flung influences beyond the borders of the us , and that other space agencies are prioritizing their programs in a hidden race against the us space program .",
    "this could have had the effect of blocking uv astronomy , at least in the direction of conducting a new all - sky survey , by the major players in space astronomy .    in the immediate future ,",
    "only one space mission ( gimi , see below ) has the potential of yielding results relevant to the derivation of a full uv sky survey .",
    "gimi will reach only the relatively brighter objects , an extension of a few magnitudes below the td-1 limit . with the exception of nearby galaxies ,",
    "no extragalactic objects are expected to be measured by it .",
    "in addition , there is the fuse mission , which will hopefully begin to operate within 1998 .    given these rather pessimistic constraints , it is gratifying that nasa selected in late-1997 the galex mission ( see below ) , which was mentioned above in the context of a comparison of surveys .",
    "galex will conduct an all - sky uv survey , comparable to that of the palomar sky survey in the optical domain .",
    "the results from galex will become available in the second half of the next decade .    before describing the future uv missions ,",
    "i review a few examples of missions which did not succeed to launch .",
    "a number of missions to map the sky to depths comparable with the palomar sky survey ( pss ) in the optical have been proposed , but none bar one was accepted by the suitable funding agency .",
    "an early attempt was to create a geo - synchronous updated uit ( largefield ultraviolet explorer = lux ) , proposed in 1986 .",
    "another proposed attempt was to have a smex for a uv imaging and spectroscopy all - sky survey ( pax , juno ) , then a midex for a similar purpose ( music ) .",
    "these proposals , although very good , did not survive the nasa selection . a third attempt , galex ( from the same pi as pax , juno , and music ) , was finally selected in 1997 for a 2001 launch .    a mission to study the diffuse uv background ( hube )",
    "was retained by nasa as backup for a selected mission .",
    "a canadian group proposed to study a mission similar to juno for a national canadian small satellite .",
    "some of its members were among the initiators of starlab , a one - meter class space schmidt proposed for uv surveys , which was scrapped in the late-80s .",
    "it is possible that the canadian option will be to fly on a shuttle - carried long duration platform .",
    "a conceptual design for a very ambitious survey telescope , dedicated to uv astronomy , was presented by the byurakan observatory ( armenia ) and by the astronomical institute of potsdam , germany ( tovmassian 1991d ) .",
    "the astrophysical schmidt orbital telescope ( aschot ) would be able to image a 2@xmath9.5 field of view with 2 \" resolution , using an all - reflecting schmidt design with an 80 cm aperture .",
    "the calculated performance indicated a detection limit with s / n=10 at m@xmath26=24.0 in a 30 min exposure .",
    "however , there are formidable aspects in dealing with a 9000@xmath279000 pixel array .",
    "the primary mirror ( diameter 120 cm ) and the reflective corrector plate ( diameter 80 cm ) of aschot have been fabricated by carl zeiss jena prior to the re - unification of germany .",

    "the suv mission will be almost exclusively dedicated to intermediate resolution spectroscopy , but its focal plane camera has imaging possibilities similar to those of the hst acs ( b. shustov , 1997 private communication ) .",
    "also , given the delays in launching the first spectrum mission ( spectrum x-@xmath28 ) , it is doubtful whether suv will be realized before the year 2000 .",
    "the one space experiment constructed exclusively for uv astronomy is fuse ( the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer mission ) , manifested for a late-1998 launch .",
    "this satellite is desiged to provide high spectral resolution observations ( @xmath29=30,000 ) in the band 90.5 to 119.5 nm .",
    "fuse is designed for a three year life in low earth orbit and has significant effective area peaking at @xmath0100 cm@xmath10 near 105 nm .",
    "this allows high resolution spectroscopy with s / n=20 of objects with monochromatic magnitude 12 in 100,000 seconds of observation , which is equivalent to about 3.3 days , given the expected operating efficiency .",
    "most of the observing time will be dedicated to a number of key program , such as the study of deuterium abundance in the interstellar and intergalactic space .",
    "the gimi imaging instrument is integrated into its carrier spacecraft ( argus , from the usaf ) .",
    "it is primarily military in character aiming at detecting and characterizing sources of uv emission ( or atmospheric opacity ) , which could affect the detection , identification , and tracking of missiles and warheads .",
    "argus is expected to be launched in late-1998 on a delta ii vehicle .",
    "the gimi instrument on argos has as one of its declared goals the production of a full sky survey in three uv bands .",
    "the most recent description of gimi is by carruthers & seeley ( 1996 ) .",
    "gimi consists of two bore - sighted ebccd cameras , each imaging a @xmath31 field of view with a resolution of @xmath03.9 .",
    "the paper gives also the sensitivities expected ( fig .",
    "the gimi imagers cover three spectral regions with two detector - telescope assemblies .",
    "camera 1 has a kcl cathode sensitive to the 75 - 110 nm band and with a nominal field - of - view ( fov ) of 10@xmath32.5 .",
    "camera 2 has a split fov : an area of 7@xmath33.5 is covered by a kbr cathode sensitive to the 131 - 160 nm band , while an adjacent area of 3@xmath32.5 is imaged on a csi cathode sensitive to the 131 - 200 nm region .",
    "the most sensitive arrangement is cam .",
    "2 with the csi cathode , whereas cam . 1 , with its kcl cathode , has a sensitivity about 1/20 lower . in its sky survey mode",
    ", gimi will stare for at least 100 sec at each source ; from this , its magnitude limit is expected to be @xmath013.6 in the csi band .",
    "the tauvex ( tel aviv university uv explorer ) payload ( brosch _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) represents the most advanced attempt to design , build and operate a flexible instrument for observations in the entire uv band .",
    "the experiment is built for tel aviv university by el - op , electro - optical industries , ltd .",
    ", with the largest part of the funding from the government of israel through the ministry of science and arts and the israel space agency .",
    "tauvex images the same 0@xmath9.9 fov with three co - aligned telescopes and with an image quality of about 10 \" .",
    "it was originally conceived for a small satellite of the ofeq or smex class , but is now part of the scientific complement of the srg spacecraft scheduled to launch in late-1999 or in 2000 .",
    "the detectors used in tauvex are tailor - made by dep - delft instruments of roden , the netherlands .",
    "they consist of cste cathodes deposited on caf@xmath12 windows .",
    "the photo - electrons are amplified by a three - stack chevron arrangement of mcps and the detection is by a wedge - and - strip anode .",
    "the light passes through filters defining six spectral bands , from a very wide one which is essentially a `` blue cutoff '' at @xmath0200 nm , to three intermediate ( @xmath0300 nm wide ) bands spanning the working range 135 - 290 nm , to two `` narrow '' bands at selected regions of interest .",
    "a view of tauvex as it would look in space is shown in fig . 11 , where the tauvex thermal model ( now at lavotchkin industries in moscow ) is installed in a solar simulator chamber in preparation of a thermal vaccum test .",
    "the apertures of the three telescopes are visible on the right part of the figure and the telescopes themselves are wrapped in their thermal blankets .",
    "tauvex offers significant redundancy at component and system levels in comparison with other missions .",
    "the projected performance is detection of objects 19 mag ( monochromatic ) and brighter , with s / n@xmath3410 and in three @xmath040 nm wide bands , after a four hour pointing . at high galactic latitudes",
    "each such pointing is expected to result in the detection of some tens of qsos and agns ( mainly low - z objects ) and some hundreds of galaxies and stars .",
    "it is expected that a three - year operation of tauvex on srg will yield a deep survey of the uv sky to m(uv)=19 mag in at least three uv bands , which will cover @xmath05% of the ( high galactic latitude ) sky .",
    "this is based on the size of the field of view and the expectation that the total number of independent pointings after three years in orbit will add up to @xmath03,000 .    on the same srg platform ,",
    "co - aligned with tauvex and the rest of the higher energy instruments , will operate also the f - uvita instrument .",
    "it consists of a pair of 20 cm telescopes imaging a 1@xmath9.2 field with 10 \" resolution in spectral bands between 91 and 99 nm .",
    "each band is @xmath09 nm wide .",
    "the most up - to - date description of f - uvita can be found in its homepage at the paul - scherrer - institute in switzerland , where its sensitivity is advertised as adequate to detect v=15 b0 stars .",
    "some uv capability has been constructed into the optical / uv monitor ( ouvm ) of xmm ( mason 1996 ) .",
    "the ouvm is a 30 cm modified ritchey - chrtien telescope which images a 17 fov with @xmath01 `` resolution .",
    "the light is analyzed with filters and with a grism .",
    "the uv - optical detector operates in the 160 - 600 nm spectral range and consists of a fast readout 256@xmath27256 pixel ccd , coupled by fiber boule to the phosphor output of an image intensifier .",
    "the ccd readout is analyzed by a transputer - based processor and each photon event is centered to @xmath00.2 pixel ( 0.5 '' for normal operations ) .",
    "the difference from tauvex lies in the xmm ouvm being a single telescope time - sharing between the optical and uv ranges , and in the higher spatial resolution , realized at the expense of the smaller fov .",
    "in fall of 1997 nasa announced the selection of a small explorer experiment ( smex ) dedicated to a new all - sky survey in the uv .",
    "this is the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex : c. martin p.i .",
    "; bianchi & martin 1997 ) whose prime goal is the survey of galaxy evolution effects for the range 0@xmath35z@xmath352 .",
    "galex is a collaboration of caltech , university of california - berkeley , the johns hopkins university , columbia university , and the laboratoire dastrophysique spatiale du cnrs of marseille , france .",
    "galex is a single wide - field imaging telescope with a 50 cm diameter primary mirror and a 26 cm diameter secondary .",
    "its focal plane is 1@xmath9.2 wide and is equipped with two photon - counting position - sensitive detectors .",
    "the angular resolution is 3``-5 '' at 80% encircled energy .",
    "the light is shared between the two detectors by a dichroic beam splitter and a folding flat mirror .",
    "the detectors cover the spectral region 135 - 300 nm , selected by detector window transmission , cathode response , and beamsplitter coatings .",
    "the nominal performance of the detectors , which are cathodes with stacked mcps and crossed , helical delay lines as anodes , allow for 4096 pixels across the field - of - view .",
    "the two galex bands , as presently defined are 135 - 180 nm ( csi and caf@xmath12 ) , and 180 - 300 nm ( cste and fused silica ) .",
    "the galex mission is very ambitious , as it has both imaging as well as spectroscopic aspects .",
    "it shall be conducted from a low earth orbit , into which the pegasus launcher will insert the satellite .",
    "galex will observe by scanning the sky during the orbital night .",
    "the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) phase is baselined to last four months , after which a two - color catalog of sources to m@xmath3619.4 will be produced .",
    "in addition , it is expected that the sky background will be detected by binning the data to 1 arcmin@xmath10 and after subtracting the point sources .",
    "galex will then conduct a deep imaging survey ( dis ) of @xmath37 degrees@xmath10 of the sky , which will include areas surveyed by the hdf north and south , the eso imaging survey regions , areas of the sloan survey , _ etc .",
    "_ the deep imaging survey will detect sources @xmath04 magnitudes fainter than the all - sky survey .",
    "some indication of source variability will be obtained from the 80 - 100 field revisits done during the ais and dis phases .    the spectroscopic survey , to @xmath01 nm resolution ,",
    "shall be completed during additional four - month periods by inserting a grism in the converging beam , before the beamsplitter . a shallow spectroscopic survey to r@xmath38150",
    "shall be conducted in the first period over the entire region of the dis , after which two additional periods shall be dedicated to deeper surveys of 20 degrees@xmath10 , then 2 degrees@xmath10 , for the medium spectroscopic survey and the deep spectroscopic survey , respectively .",
    "the planned mission allows for a four - month contingency / associate investigator programs .",
    "it is now possible to compare the performance of the future missions which will bring significant information about the deep uv universe .",
    "the three experiments , xmm uv / optical monitor , tauvex , and galex , reach approximately similar limiting magnitudes .",
    "galex has a significant advantage in its global sky coverage , but it is restricted to two simultaneous bands _ vs. _",
    "three for tauvex . in comparison with the other two instruments ,",
    "galex also does not include a long - term continuous photometric monitoring option .",
    "its spatial resolution is advertised to be similar to that of the ouvm , twice better than that of tauvex .",
    "both the xmm uv / optical monitor and tauvex shall operate alongside high energy imagers , allowing a good determination of the nature of emitting sources .",
    "their deployment in high - altitude orbits _ vs. _ a leo environment for galex will presumably ensure a better s / n , given a lower sky and particle background .",
    "it is clear that ideally `` clean '' observations of the uv sky background should be made far from the earth s geocorona , only out of the galactic plane , to avoid the dust - scattered starlight . for practical purposes",
    ", we shall have to settle in the foreseeable future with observations which avoid the dust in the solar system .",
    "for this , a telescope must be located beyond the orbit of saturn , and this requires a specialized instrument .",
    "one possibility is to design multi - purpose missions to the outer planets .",
    "these , during their cruise phase or when not collecting encounter data , could be used to measure astronomical targets , such as the uv sky background .",
    "toller ( 1983 ) and toller ( 1987 ) , for instance , used the pioneer imaging photopolarimeter to map the optical emission from the milky way in blue ( 395 - 485 nm ) and in red ( 590 - 690 nm ) from beyond the asteroid belt , where the contribution of the zodiacal light was found to be negligible .",
    "the findings by toller were confirmed by the analysis of schuerman ( 1997 ) , where the boundary beyond which the zodiacal light contribution becomes very small , in comparison with the diffuse galactic background , was set at 2.8 a.u .",
    "gordon ( 1997 ) performed an analysis of the pioneer 10 and 11 data from beyond this limit and found an excess red component over that predicted from the blue light distribution ( which could be fully attributed to scattering by dust ) . a location beyond the zodiacal dust cloud , therefore",
    ", would be ideal for a measurement of the diffuse uvb and of the exceedingly faint uv galaxies .",
    "note also that some missions adopt an `` above the ecliptic '' trajectory to their target ; this also would minimize the contamination by zodiacal light and offer the deepest astronomical observations .",
    "two possibilities , one real and another potential , are to include uv observations during the cruise phases of either the fast pluto flyby ( `` pluto express '' ) or a possible neptune orbiter .",
    "the pluto express mission was being designed when its funding was frozen in 1996 with a probable launch date not before the turn of the century .",
    "the neptune orbiter has not yet even been proposed officially , but would be a logical extension of the cassini mission . assuming that cassini will reach saturn by 2004 , a neptune orbiter could launch by 2010 for a neptune arrival 5 - 10 years after that .",
    "most of its cruise phase could be made available , if so planned , for astronomical observations .",
    "similar possibilities exist for a putative interstellar precursor mission .",
    "another , much cheaper option , altough restricted in its spectral band of observation , is to follow up and expand on the experience gained by the geneva / las group in uv observations from balloons .",
    "observations from stratospheric altitudes are limited to a spectral band @xmath015 nm wide centered near 200 nm . for a while",
    ", it looked like the sr-71 s turned to nasa by the usaf could be used for this type of obsevation . however , these planes are again no longer available for scientific research . despite this limitation ,",
    "much can be gained from such a mission , if it would rely on the heritage of long - duration balloon flights with updated hardware .",
    "super - pressure balloons , flying at 40 - 45 km altitude , can perform missions of weeks to months .",
    "if launched in the antarctic , the wind patterns keep the balloon mostly over the antarctic continent . a launch in the arctic",
    "will probably have the same characteristics , but may intrude too much in patterns of civilian and military flights over the north pole .",
    "trans - oceanic flights at intermediate or equatorial latitudes are also possible and may be more convenient power - wise .",
    "present day technology allows real - time operation of a long - duration balloon mission by using the tdrss data relay satellites while having a high data rate ( israel 1993 ) . adding solar panels to a regular long - duration balloon is not a difficult task , and is one of the possibilities offered in the latest ( 1997 ) nasa draft call for `` university explorer '' missions ( note though that super - pressure",
    ", extremely high altitude balloons are not included in the unex ao ) .",
    "such a mission is therefore doable and will have a reasonable cost .",
    "i thus propose to study the possibility of designing a uv sky survey at 200 nm from a long - duration balloon platform .",
    "a major cost of any sky survey mission lies in building and qualifying space hardware .",
    "these components could have been saved in the cost of such a mission if the glazar-2 telescope could have been reactivated .",
    "this requires first an assessment of the status of the optics , the tracking mechanism , and the gimbals which compensate motions of the mir , which were left attached to the space station for almost one decade with no use .",
    "a new focal plane needs to be designed , built , tested , assembled in place of the damaged one , and the new instrument can be activated in space . however , the limitation now lies with the mir itself , which has surpassed its design lifetime .",
    "finally , an interesting possibility is to conduct a deep uv survey of a very small fraction of the sky with the hst .",
    "the wfpc-2 has the capability to image @xmath021 mag uv sources to s / n@xmath110 with deep observations using the f160bw and/or the f218w filters while covering a significant sky region .",
    "it is thus possible to design a survey of uv sources as a `` parallel '' program .",
    "a set of such observations could provide information about the faintest uv sources , beyond the capability of uit , foca , tauvex , or galex , with good morphological information , which could be used to settle the issue of the cosmological uvb .",
    "interestingly , observations with the f160bw filter will be almost devoid of stars ! our uv - galaxy model , using the bandpass of f160bw , predicts less than one star / square degree ( down to v=20 ) which could be detected in @xmath01000 sec exposures .    using the wfpc-2 exposure time calculator ,",
    "one finds that a 2,000 sec exposure at high galactic latitude reaches a s / n of 1.8 with f160bw and 7.8 with f218w for an unresolved v=20 sbc galaxy . adopting the foca galaxy count from armand & milliard ( 1994 ) and assuming the objects have @xmath3920 mag arcsec@xmath23 , a 10,000 sec exposure with f218w will yield a s / n@xmath11 per wfpc-2 pixel .",
    "at least one such object should appear on almost any deep f218w exposure .",
    "this will be , in principle , even deeper with the stis , once parallel observations with this instrument will be allowed .",
    "the hst has therefore the potential of making important observations in the mode of an unbiased survey for faint stars and galaxies .",
    "a possible instrument studied for the 2002 hst servicing mission is the wide field camera 3 ( wfc-3 ) , which will replace wfpc-2 .",
    "its ccds will probably have high quantum efficiency in the uv , perhaps an order of magnitude better than wfpc2 .",
    "the existence of this camera , with a field of view of 160``@xmath27160 '' and a pixel size of 0.04 arcsec , will make a uv survey with the hst even more attractive .    in the domain of wishes valid for",
    "every branch of astronomy one must include a wavelength - sensitive , photon - counting imaging detector .",
    "one line of such detectors was described by perryman ( 1992 , 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "they consist of superconducting tunnel junctions ( stjs ) in which a photon creates a cloud of charge carriers , which provide essentially a low resolution imaging spectrometer with @xmath4030 . presumably such detectors would be even more useful in the uv , because of the higher energy of the analyzed photons , allowing a better energy resolution . a single - pixel device of this type",
    "was already tested successfully in the laboratory ( peacock 1996 ) and a quantum efficiency of @xmath050% was demonstrated for @xmath41 200 - 1000 nm , with a spectral resolution of 45 nm .",
    "a large - format array of such devices , possibly mounted at the wfpc position on hst , would provide an imaging spectrometer with unique properties .",
    "this apparently has been proposed to esa as a follow - up instrument for the 2002 hst refurbishing mission ( peacock 1997 ) but was not selected , presumably because the difficulties of a cryogenic system to maintain the detector at t@xmath351k in the hst environment seen daunting .",
    "i have shown here that while uv astronomy flourished in the early and mid-70 s , the field stagnated , at least where sky surveys are concerned , from then on . in the early days of uv studies , a valuable resource appeared with the production of the td1 catalog .",
    "this is still , 20 years after its publication , the only all - sky survey in the uv .",
    "the td1 survey detected mostly stars , but more sensitive instruments revealed very interesting extragalactic sources ( agns , star - bursting galaxies , etc . ) .",
    "the most sensitive instrument now available for uv imaging is the hst , which can hardly qualify as a survey instrument . in terms of surveys ,",
    "a success of the gimi and uvisi missions will extend the td1 survey by about five magnitudes , and even then , only few extragalactic objects would be accessible .",
    "the big step forward will come with the galex , tauvex and xmm uv / optical monitor surveys .",
    "the euv range was explored by the rosat wfc and by the euve , but due to the opacity of the ism , only relatively nearby objects were detected .",
    "the outstanding sources are viewed through `` windows '' in the ism , where low hi column densities are encountered . at present , there are no prospects for an euve follow - up mission , but the extension of the euve operations promises more and interesting data .",
    "it is clear that , with the existing attitude toward pure research and space activities in general , it will be extremely difficult to channel funds for new space missions which will perform additional uv sky surveys deeper than and beyond that by galex .",
    "therefore , the improvement in human knowledge of the astronomical uv sky can only come about through judicious use of existing , or multi - purpose platforms , where the uv science piggy - backs on other spectral ranges .",
    "not only astronomy missions must be considered as able to yield good uv data , but also planetary or upper - atmosphere science platforms are eligible .",
    "fully new , revolutionary designs tend to be costly ; at the present stage they should be avoided .",
    "the heritage of past missions should be fully realized before embarking on new adventures . in this light ,",
    "the extension of the euve mission in a low - cost mode is commendable ; the continuation of the right - angle surveys should reveal more faint euv sources .",
    "science needs the multi - spectral all - sky uv imaging survey to 19 - 20 monochromatic magnitude which will be provided by galex , as well as a combination of cheaper alternatives , including a long - duration , very high - altitude balloon with a foca or aschot - type telescope and a high - resolution detector with electronic readout for a sky survey in the 200 nm band . a mini - survey with hst in the uv ,",
    "perhaps with an stj camera , will take advantage of the exquisite imaging capabilities of this facilty .",
    "an extended euv all - sky survey , @xmath42 more sensitive than euve and with better angular resolution , is also required .",
    "the inclusion of a uv sky survey phase in planetary missions bound for the outer solar system , to observe from beyond the zodiacal dust cloud , is advocated .",
    "uv research at tel aviv university is supported by special grants from the government of israel the ministry of science and arts , through the israel space agency , and from the austrian friends of tel aviv university , as well as by a center of excellence award from the israel science foundation .",
    "i acknowledge support from a us - israel binational award to study uv sources imaged by the faust experiment , and the hospitality of nordita , the danish space research institute , and the space telescope science institute , where parts of this review were prepared .",
    "i am grateful for the help of many individuals in producing this review .",
    "benny bilenko calculated sky models , liliana formiggini recalculated the optical - to - uv transformation and compared the predicted and actual uv brightness for virgo , hrant tovmassian explained intricacies of the glazar series , and jeff bloch from the alexis team supplied sky charts and information .",

    "<S> i review the development of uv and euv astronomy , covering the spectral range from 5 to 300 nm , with emphasis on sky surveys for discrete sources . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss studies which resulted in lists of sources observed by imaging and deliberately omit most spectroscopic studies . </S>",
    "<S> technical issues , such as detector and telescope developments , are treated separately from descriptions of specific missions and their results , which contributed to the understanding of the uv sky . </S>",
    "<S> the missions are compared in terms of their `` survey power '' , a variable which combines sky coverage and survey depth . </S>",
    "<S> i use the existing knowledge of uv sources to predict views of the uv sky , which i then compare with those actually detected . </S>",
    "<S> finally , uv missions which will detect fainter sources and will fly in the near future are described , and a wish list for low - cost ventures , which could advance considerably our knowledge of the uv sky is presented . </S>"
