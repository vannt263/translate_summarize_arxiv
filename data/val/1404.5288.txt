    "many quantum gravity approaches rely on a path integral construction as their foundation , for example spin foam models @xcite , group and tensorial field theory @xcite , ( causal ) dynamical triangulations @xcite or quantum regge calculus @xcite .",
    "these approaches have the same goal , namely to provide a way to compute ( and give meaning to ) the gravitational path integral , i.e. the sum over all histories between two 3dimensional boundary geometries , where each history is a 4geometry describing a possible transition weighted by the ( exponential of the ) einstein  hilbert action .",
    "an essential part in this path integral is the measure over the space of geometries , i.e. the space of all metrics modulo diffeomorphisms .    to propose a well  defined path integral , one generically has to introduce a regulator to truncate the degrees of freedom of the theory . in gravitational theories mentioned above this",
    "is achieved by discretizing the theory , e.g. on a triangulation .",
    "however , the introduction of discretizations comes with a caveat : in general , a discretization of the classical theory can not be chosen uniquely , if the only requirement is that this discretization leads to the correct continuum action . whereas some agreement has been reached on the regge action as a preferred discrete action @xcite , at least for the theory without cosmological constant , the debate on the measure in regge calculus @xcite and spin foams @xcite is not settled .",
    "even more troubling in the context of gravity , discretizations generically break diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite , which is deeply intertwined with the dynamics of general relativity .",
    "furthermore , this might induce an unphysical dependency of this theory on the choice of the discretization .",
    "different approaches to quantum gravity differ in how they deal with these problems , e.g. in regge calculus one considers only one triangulation with varying edge lengths , whereas in causal dynamical triangulations one keeps equilateral simplices and sums over all triangulations .",
    "group field theories additionally sum over all topologies . which of these schemes leads to a sensible theory of quantum gravity can not be determined a priori .",
    "these intricacies are deeply rooted in the fact that diffeomorphism symmetry is broken by the discretisation and that the relation between discrete and continuous gravity is still hardly understood .",
    "this particularly affects the choice of measure in quantum gravity theories , which is crucially important for the dynamics in the continuum limit , since it also resembles a choice of the measure on the space of geometries .    for spin foam models , arguments that link diffeomorphism symmetry , choice of (",
    "anomaly free ) measure and divergence structure due to having non  compact gauge orbits from the diffeomorphism group have been made in @xcite .",
    "this led also to the suggestion to choose a measure which has a certain ( weak ) notion of discretization independence , e.g. such that the amplitudes become independent under ` trivial ' edge and face subdivisions @xcite .",
    "as mentioned the choice of measure heavily influences the divergence structure of the models @xcite .",
    "thus one can adjust the measure to obtain the divergence structure that fits the divergences one expects from diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "this of course does not fully guarantee diffeomorphism symmetry or triangulation independence , as divergences might also arise due to other reasons .    in regge calculus",
    ", several measures have been proposed : in @xcite hamber and williams propose a discretization of the formal continuum path integral , with a local discretization of the ( dewitt ) measure @xcite , conflicting with the proposal by menotti and peirano @xcite , who mod out a subgroup of the continuum diffeomorphisms resulting in a highly non  local measure .",
    "a different discretization , also leading to a non  local measure due to discretizing first the dewitt super metric @xcite and then forming the determinant , was proposed in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will pick up the suggestion in @xcite , to choose a measure that , at least for the linearized ( regge ) theory , leads to as much discretization invariance as possible .",
    "these considerations require to actually integrate out degrees of freedom and thus take the dynamics into account .",
    "the requirement of discretisation independence seems to be at odds with interacting theories , which possess local / propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be resolved by allowing a non  local action or non  local amplitudes for the quantum theory  which in fact are unavoidable if one coarse grains the theory . non ",
    "local amplitudes are however difficult to deal with .",
    "we therefore ask in this paper the question , whether in the quantum theory we can retain as much symmetry as in the classical theory , with a choice of local measure .",
    "the classical 4d regge action is known to be invariant under @xmath1 moves and @xmath2 moves , but not under @xmath3 moves @xcite . here",
    "the non  invariance under the @xmath3 moves  in fact the only move involving bulk curvature for the solution  allows the local regge action to nevertheless lead to a theory with propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "we therefore ask whether it is possible to have a local measure for linearized regge calculus that leads to invariance under @xmath1 and / or @xmath2 moves .",
    "such a measure would therefore reproduce the symmetry properties of the regge action .",
    "we will however show that such a local path integral measure does not exist .",
    "our requirement of ( maximal ) discretisation independence is motivated by the ` perfect action / discretisation ' approach @xcite that targets to construct a discretisation , which ` perfectly ' encodes the continuum dynamics and has a discrete remnant of the continuum diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "examples of such ` perfect discretisations ' are 3d regge calculus with and without a cosmological constant @xcite and also 4d regge calculus , if the boundary data impose a flat solution in the bulk . in these examples ,",
    "the basic building blocks mimic the continuum dynamics , e.g. one takes constantly curved tetrahedra for 3d gravity with a cosmological constant .",
    "such perfect discretisations can be constructed as the fixed point of a coarse graining scheme , see for instance @xcite .",
    "once such a discretisation is constructed , the predictions of the theory become independent of the fineness of the discretisation . on the one hand one can compute observables for the coarsest discretisation , while on the other hand one",
    "can straightforwardly define the continuum limit and return to a description with local degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , the examples that have been considered so far lead to the conjecture that diffeomorphism symmetry is equivalent to discretisation independence . for quantum mechanical systems",
    "( with time discretization ) , it has been proven in @xcite that diffeomorphism symmetry implies discretization invariance . recently",
    ", the relationship between diffeomorphism symmetry and discretization independence has been strengthened in the principle of dynamical cylindrical consistency @xcite for time  evolving discrete systems @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been the main motivation of @xcite : the question has been , whether requiring triangulation independence , i.e. invariance under pachner moves @xcite , can be used as a dynamical determination of the path integral measure in ( linearized ) regge calculus .",
    "one would expect that this requirement would also single out a unique measure . in 3d",
    "this lead to a simple measure factor invariant under all pachner moves , which is consistent with the asymptotics of the ponzano ",
    "regge ( spin foam ) model @xcite .",
    "the 4d case , that is the expressions for the determinants of the hessians of the action evaluated on the solution , turned out to be astonishingly similar to the 3d one , yet these expressions were modified by an overall factor , which appears to be non  factorising with respect to the ( sub)simplices of the triangulation and resisted so far a geometric interpretation .",
    "more importantly , it has been conjectured in @xcite to be non  local and , thus , effectively hindering a construction of a local path integral invariant under a subset of pachner moves in 4d @xcite .",
    "this factor will be the main focus of this paper , in which we will derive a geometric interpretation , namely as a criterion determining whether @xmath4 vertices ( in @xmath5 dimensions ) lie on a @xmath6sphere @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation allows us to prove that this intricate factor is non  factorising , i.e. it can not be expressed as a simple product of amplitudes associated to the ( sub)simplices of the triangulation .",
    "( we will refer to this property as ` non  local ' . )",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : review ] we review the setup and main results of @xcite . section [ sec : interpretation ] deals with the derivation of the new interpretation of the non  factorising factor , namely as a criterion determining whether six vertices lie on a 3sphere , uncovering the factor s non  local nature . to examine the general cases",
    ", we have to generalize the study of @xcite to more general orientations in section [ sec : orientation ] .",
    "we discuss different choices for the measure ( see also appendix [ app : bary ] ) .",
    "the paper is concluded by a discussion of the result in section [ sec : discussion ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendix ] we discuss some particular cases of the non  local factor .",
    "in the work @xcite it has been examined whether one can define a triangulation invariant path integral measure for ( linearized ) length regge calculus .",
    "let us briefly recap the setup : consider the euclidean path integral for the regge discretization of gravity given on a 3d or a 4d triangulation : @xmath7 } \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the fixed edge lengths on the boundary of the triangulated manifold @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 $ ] is called the regge action and is given by the following expression in @xmath5 dimensions : @xmath11:= - \\sum_{h \\subset \\text{bulk } } v_h \\ , \\omega_h^{\\text{(bulk ) } }   - \\sum_{h \\subset \\text{bdry } } v_h \\ , \\omega_h^{\\text{(bdry ) } }   \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the volume of the @xmath13simplex @xmath14 , also called ` hinge ' , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the deficit angle or the exterior boundary angle respectively , located at the hinge @xmath14 in the @xmath5dimensional simplex @xmath17",
    ". the deficit angles at a hinge are defined as a sum of the dihedral angles of the @xmath5simplices sharing the hinge modulo @xmath18 and relative orientation of the simplices .",
    "the definition for matching orientations of the simplices , also considered in @xcite , is : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath5-dimensional dihedral angle at the hinge @xmath14 in the @xmath5simplex @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath22 depends on the number of pieces glued together at this boundary . in case",
    "only two pieces are put together @xmath23 .",
    "this action has been linearized , i.e. expanded ( up to quadratic order ) around a flat background solution , denoted by edge lengths @xmath24 , that is a solution of the equations of motion @xmath25 with vanishing deficit angles @xmath15 : @xmath26 the integration is then performed over the perturbations @xmath27 , such that the hessian matrix of the regge action , i.e. @xmath28 , becomes the ( inverse ) ` propagator ' of the theory .",
    "the motivating question of @xcite has been whether it is possible to define a measure factor @xmath29 , as a function of the background edge lengths , that allows for a triangulation invariant regge path integral .",
    "to examine triangulation independence , it is enough to only consider local changes of the triangulation , so  called pachner moves @xcite : a consecutive application of these transfers a triangulation of a manifold into any other possible triangulation of the same manifold .    in @xcite exact formulas for the hessian matrix in 3d and",
    "4d have been derived in great detail from which one concludes a very specific form of measure factors . in the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to just recalling the main results :    the hessian matrices one has to compute are of the following form .",
    "in 3d we have @xmath30 where the dihedral angles are associated to the edges . in 4d",
    "the situation is more complicated @xmath31 yet only the first term survives , since we are considering a flat background solution @xmath32 and only local changes of the triangulation , which leave the boundary unchanged .",
    "thus for both cases of 3d and 4d regge calculus , the main task is to compute the first derivatives of the deficit angles .",
    "although these first derivatives of the deficit angles can be computed explicitly @xcite , it is much more effective to use techniques of @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this utilizes the flat background ( for the linearized regge action ) and hence the fact that the simplicial complex is embeddable into @xmath33 .",
    "one then considers small deviations in the edge lengths so that the complex remains embeddable , i.e. the deficit angles @xmath34 are unchanged , @xmath35 .",
    "this requirement automatically translates into a requirement on the variations of the dihedral angles @xmath36 , which are part of the respective deficit angle .",
    "then one computes the derivatives of the dihedral angles @xcite under the assumption that only two edge lengths are varied at the same time @xcite ; starting from the simplest case , one derives all other derivatives of the deficit angles by considering the relative change of edge lengths under infinitesimal deviations . eventually , one finds in 3d : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the edge lengths between the vertices @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the deficit angle at the edge @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the volume of the tetrahedron obtained by removing the vertex @xmath39 .",
    "vertices in @xmath5 dimensions ; by removing one vertex , @xmath44 vertices remain , which span a @xmath5simplex . ]",
    "the signs @xmath45 depend on the orientation and the considered pachner move .",
    "we provide a different derivation of them in section [ sec : interpretation ] . in this work",
    "we will neglect the boundary terms , since they are not relevant for the main argument of this paper , yet they are essential to show that the classical regge action is invariant under pachner moves @xcite .",
    "indeed , the idea to construct a triangulation invariant measure factor , relies crucially on the invariance of the classical regge action under pachner moves . in 3d",
    "this is the case for all pachner moves , such that we were able to derive an invariant measure factor , which is factorising , and hence local , with a straightforward geometrical interpretation : @xmath46 to each edge @xmath47 of the triangulation one associates the edge length @xmath48 and a numerical factor of @xmath49 , to each tetrahedron @xmath50 one associates the inverse ( square root ) of its volume @xmath51 .",
    "this measure factor is consistent , even up to the numerical factor is not unambiguous .",
    "it can either be assigned to edges or tetrahedra . ] , with the asymptotic expansion of the @xmath52 @xmath53 symbol @xcite , the amplitude associated to a tetrahedron in the ponzano regge model , which is triangulation invariant ( and topological ) as well .    in 4d regge calculus",
    "the situation is more complicated , as one might expect : first the regge action itself is in general not invariant under the 33 pachner move @xcite .",
    "it is a peculiar move , since both possible configurations only differ by the triangle shared by all three 4simplices of this configuration , no dynamical edge is involved .",
    "hence the configurations are solely determined by the boundary data , which might be chosen such that the deficit angle on the bulk triangle does not vanish , i.e. the configuration is not flat .",
    "however as soon as this is the case , the regge action is not invariant under this pachner move any more .",
    "thus the regge action is not a suitable starting point to define an invariant measure under all 4d pachner moves .",
    "nevertheless the 4d regge action is invariant under the 51 and 42 pachner moves ( and their inverses ) , so it has been examined whether one can define a measure factor that is at least invariant under these two local changes of the triangulation .",
    "surprisingly , the ( considered part of the ) hessian matrix is very similar to the 3d case : @xmath54 where the factor @xmath55 is the only difference to the 3d case , besides the fact that the @xmath43 now denote volumes of 4simplices .",
    "note that for the 51 move in 4d ( and similarly the 41 move in 3d ) , the hessian matrix possesses four null eigenvectors , which correspond to a vertex translation invariance of the subdividing vertex .",
    "the divergent part of the integral is then identified as an integral over a 4d volume and is gauge fixed to 1 .",
    "we also provide a brief derivation of in section [ sec : orientation ] for more general orientations .",
    "the emphasis of this paper lies on this factor @xmath55 , which is given by the following expression : @xmath56 since the hessian matrix is symmetric , one concludes that @xmath55 actually does not depend on the vertices @xmath57 and @xmath58 , such that it turns into an overall factor of the hessian matrix .",
    "thus we will only refer to it as @xmath59 in the following .",
    "ignoring @xmath59 for the time being , one can construct an ` almost ' triangulation invariant measure , very similar to the 3d case : @xmath60 where @xmath61 now denotes the volume of the 4simplex @xmath62 .",
    "the numerical factors are again assigned to the edges .    despite the concise expression of @xmath59",
    ", it both impedes the construction of a triangulation invariant measure and resists a nice geometric interpretation , since it is not obvious , whether it can be written as a product of amplitudes associated to ( sub)simplices .",
    "hence it has been conjectured in @xcite that @xmath59 is non  local and can not be written in a factorising way .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a geometric interpretation for the factor @xmath59 , namely it is a criterion that determines whether the 6 vertices , that make up the simplicial complex ( in 4d ) to which the pachner move is applied , lie on a 3sphere .",
    "we will use this to prove that the factor @xmath59 generically can not be accommodated by a local measure factor , in particular not by simple product ( or quotient ) of volumes of ( sub)simplices .",
    "in this section we will derive a geometric interpretation for the factor @xmath59 mentioned above . actually , the definition of @xmath59 is valid in any dimension @xmath63 , such that we will derive its geometric interpretation for arbitrary dimensions will also arise in higher dimensions in the framework of linearized regge calculus .",
    "we can only confirm this for @xmath64 @xcite . ] .    in the following we will discuss a simplicial complex in @xmath5 dimensions , to which a pachner move will be applied .",
    "consider @xmath4 vertices embedded in @xmath33 , such that they form non  degenerate @xmath5simplices .",
    "the geometry can be completely characterized by the set of the edge lengths @xmath65 , describing the euclidean distances between the vertices .",
    "given a set of vertices and the edge lengths between them , one can define the associated cayley  menger matrix @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "in the case we consider here , this is a @xmath67dim .",
    "matrix given by : @xmath68 in general , the determinant of the cayley  menger matrix , @xmath69 , associated to a @xmath5simplex is proportional to the square of its @xmath5volume . however , in the example at hand , the @xmath4 vertices are embedded in @xmath33 , such that they form a degenerate @xmath70simplex , hence @xmath71 . since we have required that the @xmath5simplices are non  degenerate , @xmath66 has exactly one null eigenvector , corresponding to changes of the edge lengths , such that the @xmath4 vertices remain ( embeddable ) in @xmath33 . to describe this null eigenvector ,",
    "let us introduce some notation .    by @xmath72",
    "we denote the submatrix of @xmath66 obtained by deleting its @xmath39th column and its @xmath40th row with @xmath73 .",
    "the determinant of the submatrix , i.e. the @xmath74th minor of @xmath66 , is denoted by @xmath75 .",
    "to simplify notation we simply call the diagonal minors @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath77 , all off - diagonal minors can be expressed in terms of the diagonal ones @xcite : @xmath78 before we construct the null eigenvector of @xmath66 , it is instructive to examine the minors @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 in more detail and discuss their geometric interpretation .    the matrix @xmath79 , obtained by deleting the  0th column and row of @xmath66 is particularly important in this paper .",
    "it is given by : @xmath82 it has been shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that @xmath83 has a very specific geometric meaning . in case",
    "@xmath84 the @xmath4 vertices lie on a @xmath6dimensional sphere , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] for an example in @xmath85 . in a sense , this is a non  local statement , since it can only be deduced if the positions of all @xmath4 vertices are known ; it can not be inferred from just @xmath44 vertices . from the construction of the null eigenvector",
    ", we will show that @xmath86 .",
    "hence we argue that @xmath59 is non  local in section [ sec : non - local ] .     the situation in 2d : four vertices on a 1sphere . ]",
    "the second interesting minor we want to discuss is @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "if one takes a look at the definition of @xmath66 in again , then one realizes that by removing the @xmath39th row and column , one removes all edge lengths with the index @xmath89 .",
    "the remaining matrix is again a cayley - menger matrix , yet for a @xmath5simplex .",
    "hence @xmath90    the single null eigenvector of @xmath66 is given by with respect to different rows . ]",
    "@xmath91 the signs @xmath92 and @xmath45 are determined only up to an overall sign ambiguity .",
    "we will show below that we can choose @xmath45 to be the same signs that appear also in and .",
    "the action of the matrix @xmath66 on @xmath93 gives the following relations : @xmath94 the first condition fixes the relative signs @xmath45 and is straightforward to interpret if one recalls the change of the triangulation under the pachner move .",
    "take a @xmath95 move for example , where the new vertex @xmath96 is added inside to the @xmath44 vertices forming the @xmath5simplex .",
    "the relation shows that the volume before and after the pachner move is the same : @xmath97 which fixes the signs @xmath98 and @xmath99 , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "similar relations also hold for the other pachner moves . for different ( relative ) orientations ( see section [ sec : orientation ] ) ,",
    "one or more signs get flipped such that such a clear separation between volumes ` before ' and ` after ' the pachner move is not possible any more .",
    "in fact , since we mainly discuss the 51 move in this paper , we fix @xmath98 , i.e. the orientation of the coarse simplex , because it is determined by the boundary data and is thus not affected by moving the vertex @xmath96 .",
    "this singles out the coarse simplex as a particular reference frame with respect to which the relative orientation of the other simplices is defined .    at this point",
    "we can also determine the sign @xmath92 using equation for @xmath100 @xmath101 thus we conclude @xmath102 .",
    "the relations can be used to derive a relation between the non  local factor @xmath59 and the criterion @xmath83 determining whether @xmath103 vertices lie on a @xmath6sphere .",
    "recall that for arbitrary @xmath104 , @xmath59 was defined as : @xmath105 let us expand @xmath106 as follows : @xmath107 this proves the relation between the non  local measure @xmath59 and the criterion @xmath83 .",
    "this automatically gives a new interpretation to the non  factorising factor @xmath86 appearing in the 4d pachner moves . if it vanishes all six vertices of the 4simplices involved in the pachner move lie on a 3sphere . to determine whether this is the case or",
    "not , one has to know the positions of all six vertices with respect to each other , it can not be inferred from a subset .",
    "thus it is already implied that the factor @xmath59 has to be non  local , since its geometric meaning can only be deduced if the relative positions of all six vertices are known .",
    "we will use this fact in section [ sec : non - local ] to show that @xmath59 does not factorise .",
    "this geometric interpretation is even more pronounced if we express the factor @xmath59 in affine coordinates . to this end",
    "we specialize to the @xmath108 move , in which we integrate out @xmath5 edge lengths , that start from a subdividing vertex @xmath96 , which lies inside the final simplex .    an efficient way to describe the coordinate of the subdividing vertex 0 with respect to the final simplex @xmath109 is by using affine coordinates .",
    "the idea is to write the position vector @xmath110 of the new vertex as a weighted sum of the position vectors @xmath111 , with weights @xmath112 .",
    "the condition @xmath113 ensures that this prescription is well  defined . if one additionally requires that @xmath114 , then the new vertex is inside the final simplex .",
    "as soon as one of the @xmath112 is negative , the vertex 0 is located outside .",
    "hence , the position vector @xmath110 is given by @xmath115 thus @xmath116 the ( square of the ) new edge lengths is given by @xmath117 : @xmath118 recalling the determinant expression of @xmath119 , i.e. and , @xmath120 are the entries of the first row and column of the matrix @xmath79 . without changing the determinant we subtract @xmath112 times the @xmath121th row from the first one for all @xmath122 and obtain : @xmath123 where it is straightforward to derive that @xmath124 .",
    "again , we repeat the procedure for the columns by subtracting @xmath112 times the @xmath121th column from the first one for all @xmath125 . then the result can be written as @xmath126 indeed , is a remarkable identity for @xmath59 ( in the 51 move , it is also possible to describe @xmath59 in a similar way for the 42 move .",
    "however , there one has to choose one of the two 4simplices ( in the 2 simplex configuration ) as a reference frame to describe the fixed position of the additional vertex .",
    "clearly , this is not unambiguous . ] ) : the non  locality of @xmath59 here is encoded in the choice of reference frame , namely the final simplex . in particular from the perspective of the five simplex configuration , this is not obvious .",
    "moreover , the dependence on the position of the new vertex only enters into the factor @xmath127 through the weights @xmath112 .",
    "let us describe the geometric meaning of @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 denote the position vector of the circumcenter of the @xmath0simplex @xmath109 , i.e. the circumcenter of the 3sphere circumscribing the 4simplex .",
    "then the distance between this point and the vertex 0 is given by : @xmath130 yet , by definition of @xmath129 , @xmath131 .",
    "thus @xmath132 and finally @xmath133 from this fact and we can simply deduce several properties of @xmath59 : first of all , since @xmath134 ( by assumption ) , we conclude that @xmath135 exactly if @xmath136 . from identity",
    "it is clear that this happens only if the vertex 0 lies on the circumscribing sphere of the 4simplex @xmath109 , namely @xmath137 . on the other hand",
    ", we can directly consider the definition of @xmath127 : @xmath138 it is straightforward to recognize that if we restrict the vertex 0 to stay inside the 4simplex , i.e. @xmath139 , then @xmath140 is only possible if all @xmath112 except one vanish .",
    "this is exactly the case when the vertex @xmath96 is moved on top one of the vertices of the final ( coarser ) simplex .",
    "[ fig : degenerate ] for the 2d case . in 4d four of the initial five simplices become degenerate and from the limits @xmath141 @xmath142 for the volumes and the length variables it is clear that @xmath143 .",
    "this limit , in which one vertex is moved on top of another plays a crucial role in the relation between diffeomorphism symmetry and triangulation independence @xcite : in the discrete diffeomorphism symmetry is realized as an invariance with respect to moving vertices . indeed finding a triangulation invariant measure for",
    "the @xmath1 move would also imply invariance of the path integral under changing the position of the subdividing vertex @xmath96 .",
    "the classical action ( or rather hamilton ",
    "jacobi functional , i.e. the action evaluated on the solution ) already has this symmetry .",
    "an extreme case is given by moving vertices to on top of other vertices , which effectively coarse grains the triangulation .",
    "one would expect a singular behaviour in this case , as the lengths variables one integrates over become redundant ( we are in the linearized theory , and moving the vertex actually affects the background variables ) .",
    "apart from these degenerate cases it can happen that @xmath59 vanishes , if we move the subdividing vertex outside the coarser simplex . in this case",
    "some some @xmath144 . indeed , the conditions @xmath136 and @xmath145 fix three of the five @xmath112 , parametrising a 3sphere , thus explaining the previous geometric interpretation .",
    "yet these cases involve a change of orientation , which will be reflected in the definition of the deficit angle and hence the action .",
    "one might be concerned that the formulas derived in @xcite are no longer valid , but we will show in section [ sec : orientation ] that the same arguments work also in this case .     the degenerate limit in @xmath146d , in which the inner vertex @xmath96 is moved on top of one of the vertices , here @xmath147 , of the original triangle . clearly , once the limit is reached the areas of the triangles @xmath148 and @xmath149 vanish . ]",
    "the geometric interpretation of the factor @xmath59 reveals its non  local structure , that it does not factorize over of the triangulation .",

    "let us revisit the simple 2d example .",
    "consider again the triangle @xmath154 spanned by three vertices , which is subdivided in a 13 move by the vertex @xmath96 placed in its center . if one intends to move the vertex @xmath96 outside the triangle @xmath154 , one has two options : either one crosses through an edge or a vertex , i.e. a 1dim . or a 0dim . subsimplex .",

    "the vertex @xmath96 can ` leave ' the initial 4simplex either through a tetrahedron , a triangle , an edge or a vertex .",

    "the same new triangles are created by adding the vertex @xmath96 , but this new vertex is now located outside the triangle , which corresponds to a change of orientation .",
    "let us discuss this further .",
    "we consider here the 13 pachner , in which the triangle @xmath154 , formed by the vertices 1 , 2 and 3 , is subdivided into three triangles @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath164 by adding a new vertex @xmath96 and connecting it to all old vertices . on the left the ` usual ' configuration after the 13 pachner move with the vertex @xmath96 inside the triangle is depicted , on the right the vertex 0 is outside the triangle , which results here in the opposite orientation of the triangle @xmath148 . ]    to be more precise , moving the vertex @xmath96 outside the triangle @xmath154 through the edge @xmath155 changes the relative orientation of the triangle @xmath148 with respect to the triangles @xmath149 and @xmath164 .",
    "this results into one sign swap in the definition of the deficit angle at the vertex @xmath96 ( modulo @xmath168 ) : @xmath169 the last part of equation denotes the formal sum over all triangles @xmath170 meeting at the vertex @xmath96 , where each triangle now carries a colouring @xmath171 denoting its relative orientation , see also @xcite .",
    "this simplicial complex is embeddable into @xmath172 , if the deficit angle @xmath173 at vertex @xmath96 vanishes modulo @xmath18 .",
    "this condition can be automatically translated into the fact that the dihedral angles ( at vertex @xmath96 ) in the triangles @xmath149 and @xmath164 have to sum up to the one in the triangle @xmath148 , which can be nicely seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation ] .",
    "let us return to the 4d case .",
    "as the argument above shows , the change of relative signs in the definition of the deficit angle coincides with the change of relative signs of the 4simplices , i.e. the signs @xmath174 . from",
    "that we deduce @xmath175 finally the general definition of the deficit angle ( modulo @xmath168 ) located at the triangle @xmath176 is : @xmath177    naturally the questions arises , how this affects the derivation of the hessian matrix of the regge action .",
    "as it turns out , it hardly does .",
    "let us prove it now :    the starting point of the derivation remains the same , namely we consider a simplicial complex made up of @xmath4 points embedded in @xmath33 with non ",
    "degenerate @xmath5simplices .",
    "hence the cayley ",
    "menger determinant @xmath69 is vanishing and the cayley ",
    "menger matrix @xmath66 has exactly one null eigenvector .",
    "the embeddebility into @xmath33 and also the vanishing of the cayley  menger determinant is due to the vanishing of the deficit angles @xmath34 ( modulo @xmath168 ) , such that we require that the deficit angles do not change under deviations of the edge lengths , i.e. @xmath35 .    to put it differently , the condition @xmath71 , where @xmath66 only has one null eigenvector , ensures that the given lengths form geometric @xmath5dim .",

    ", we have thoroughly discussed the changes of orientation that occur , if one moves the subdividing vertex outside the coarser 4simplex .",
    "this vertex can be moved outside in different ways , which can be summarized by stating through which subsimplex it has ` left ' the coarser 4simplex .",
    "then all 4simplices sharing this subsimplex change their relative orientation , which directly translates into a change of sign in the definition of the deficit angles for all dihedral angles stemming from these 4simplices .",

    "we have the same factor @xmath59 appearing in the hessian of the action , which is vanishing if the subdividing vertex is moved onto the 3sphere defined by the five vertices of the coarser 4simplex .",
    "in this case the fluctuation matrix @xmath199 becomes singular vanishes , the whole hessian matrix vanishes . ] .",
    "interestingly there is a recent conjecture , that not including the sum over orientations ( and thus avoiding this situation ) , would avoid divergences in spin foams @xcite .",
    "the findings here support this conjecture in a further way : not only may the sum over orientations lead to non  compact ( potential ) gauge orbits .",
    "additionally there is a submanifold of configurations , on which the fluctuation matrix becomes singular , which only appears if the subdividing vertex is moved outside the coarser simplex ( and if one adds up the actions for the different simplices with their correct orientations ) .",
    "given the concise version of @xmath59 in affine coordinates , see , one may ask whether one can construct a measure factor that absorbs the @xmath59 factor under the 51 move .",
    "that is one needs to know which five simplices are coarse grained to one simplex @xmath200 as the factor @xmath59 refers to this simplex @xmath200 .",
    "the measure one has to choose is then @xmath201 where the @xmath112 can be expressed in terms of the lengths @xmath202 and the lengths of the simplex @xmath200 . again",
    ", ` non  locality ' arises because it is impossible to rewrite this expression into factors that would only refer to the initial five 4simplices ( or other subsimplices ) .",
    "instead we have one factor referring to a complex of five simplices .    here",
    "the modifications to the measure due to the non  local factor are specifically made to absorb these contributions , which still requires to identify ( and specify ) the complexes to which a 51 move can ( and will ) be applied . thus subdividing one 4simplex arbitrary many times by 15 moves and integrating out again by 15 moves with the measure above we will finally end up with an amplitude for",
    "the one final simplex , which of course will be ` local ' , i.e. only refer to the geometry of this simplex .",
    "one can nevertheless ask whether there exists a local measure invariant under a 51 move , restricted to special configurations .",
    "an example of such a restriction is to consider only barycentric subdivisions .",
    "the ansatz of a local measure ( factorizing over ( sub)simplices ) leads to a functional equation that has to be solved , yet whether a solution exists is an open question . in appendix [ app :",
    "bary ] , we present a measure @xmath203 that is preserved under a single barycentric 51 move , if the coarse simplex is equilateral .",
    "this local factor should be taken with a grain of salt : although it gives invariance for a subdivided equilateral simplex , it will not be invariant under repeated subdivisions , as equilateral simplices do not stay equilateral under subdivisions .",
    "in this note we have revisted the work in @xcite , in which it has been examined whether one can construct a triangulation invariant path integral measure for ( linearized ) regge calculus . while this is possible for the 3dimensional topological theory , the 4dimensional case is complicated by the appearance of an overall non  trivial factor @xmath59 , see , which can not be factorized over ( sub)simplices of the triangulation . as we have shown in this paper",
    ", this factor has a peculiar geometric interpretation , which is the key ingredient to uncover its non  factorising and , therefore , non  local nature .",
    "this result was derived for the linearized theory .",
    "it however also excludes a local measure both invariant under @xmath1 moves and gauge invariant in the sense described in the following for the full theory .",
    "the classical equation of motions for this move , which determine the solutions to be flat , display diffeomorphism symmetry as the position of the subdividing vertex can be anywhere ( if it is outside the coarser simplex one needs to take the change of ( relative ) orientation into account ) .",
    "one thus needs to gauge fix ( as in the linearized theory ) . if we assume that a local gauge invariant measure exists that leads to invariance under @xmath1 moves we could use this to define a local measure for the linearized theory , which however does not exist .",
    "we suggested a non  local measure that would absorb the non ",
    "local @xmath59 factor under @xmath1 moves .",
    "alternatively one can devise measure factors that are local and lead to an approximate invariance near very symmetric configurations .",
    "such measure factors could be taken as a hint for choosing the measure for spin foams , see for instance @xcite for a first geometric interpretation of the measure factor for a 4d model .",
    "we additionally found that allowing for a sum over orientations ( in our case having simplices of different orientations as background ) , can lead to more singular hessians . ] for the linearized regge action .",
    "this resonates with the conjecture in @xcite , that not summing over orientations might avoid divergences in spin foams , see however the discussion in @xcite , pointing out the significance of summing over orientations for refining boundary states in gravity .",
    "one could have hoped to find a measure that makes the path integral for the linearized theory invariant under @xmath1 moves ( and also @xmath2 moves ) and is local @xcite .",
    "after all this kind of invariance holds for the regge action and it was the initial motivation for the work @xcite .",
    "this work indeed turned out to reproduce successfully the measure factor found in the ponzano ",
    "regge asymptotics @xcite , the ( topological ) spin foam model for 3d gravity .",
    "we see that a theory with propagating degrees of freedom can have quite different properties in this respect even for a sector that leads to only flat solutions as is the case for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 move .",
    "such a flat sector was also discussed in @xcite from a canonical viewpoint where the flatness indeed allows for anomaly free discretizations of the constraint algebra for a special class of boundaries .",
    "that is the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints can be defined , are local and are first class , which so far is not possible to achieve for the general 4d ( discrete ) case .",
    "the results in the work at hand question the possibility to find an anomaly free quantization for this flat ( in a sense topological , as the boundaries do not allow for propagating degrees of freedom ) sector with only local constraints .",
    "we now have to expect that it is not possible to find a local invariant measure ( i.e. a one  loop effective action ) , even if one just wants to achieve invariance under @xmath1 moves .",
    "in fact the concept of ` invariance ' under local moves involving non  local amplitudes is rather hard to define : the amplitude for the initial complex in the 51 move is non  local , as it can be non  factorizing over the 5 simplices , however the final amplitude only refers to the final , coarser simplex .",
    "we therefore suggested a measure that would absorb the non  local part , which results from the hessian of the action ( where non  local part is not without ambiguities ) .",
    "the difficulties of formulating invariance conditions for non  local amplitudes arise also because one is keeping simplices as fundamental building blocks and the principle that these simplices are ` glued ' together by integrating over boundary variables .",
    "this can be taken as a hint that an alternative formulation , as presented in @xcite , is worthwhile : this formulation replaces simplices by building blocks with arbitrarily complicated boundaries and focuses on the amplitudes associated to these boundaries .",
    "the requirement of triangulation invariance ( which has become empty as it refers to the bulk , whereas in this formulation everything is defined via boundary geometries ) is replaced by the condition of cylindrical consistency for the amplitudes associated to these boundaries @xcite .",
    "such a formulation is much better suited for situations where non  local amplitudes arise and moreover does not refer to bulk triangulations at all .",
    "on the level of the ( classical ) action , this non  locality has already to be expected if one wants to achieve full triangulation invariance @xcite , i.e. under all pachner moves , as is the case with other perfect actions @xcite .    our arguments relied on the regge action , using length variables .",
    "an interesting question is whether these findings would change if one would use other variables , e.g. involving angles and / or areas @xcite .",
    "a first order formulation with length and ( 4d dihedral ) angles as in @xcite would also lead to a non  local measure , as the angles can be integrated out in each simplex locally , and a local measure in first order variables would lead to a local measure in length variables . area ",
    "regge calculus itself has non  local constraints @xcite , thus one would even expect a non  local measure ( for the associated lagrange multipliers ) for this reason .",
    "in contrast , area ",
    "angle regge calculus @xcite has local constraints , which become non  local ( reducing to the area constraints ) after integrating out the angles . here",
    "the question of non  locality might depend on whether to impose the gluing ( or shape matching ) constraints , which are part of the constraints reducing are  angle regge calculus to length regge calculus @xcite .",
    "the status of these constraints in spin foams ( or loop quantum gravity ) is debated , see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "let us also mention @xcite , which finds a local measure for a 4d model with a regge like ( first order ) action .",
    "this model is however topological , and hence it is not surprising that one can find a local measure factor in this case .",
    "it also shows that the issue of imposing gluing constraints , that are essential in regaining standard regge calculus with propagating degrees of freedom , might be crucial .",
    "the encountered non  localities are characteristic of interacting theories and unavoidable , but might be more effectively handled if other degrees of freedom are used .",
    "one possibility are dynamically determined recombinations of the initial degrees of freedom to obtain new effective degrees of freedom , which can be non  local in terms of the initial triangulation , but may interact only locally among each other .",
    "this can also be interpreted as combining the initial basic building blocks into new effective ones , which may require transformations that are more general than pachner moves .",
    "these transformations can be for example be given by dynamical embedding maps @xcite , which relate the hilbert spaces of finer and coarser boundary data .",
    "in fact the idea is to use these embedding maps to define the physical ( continuum ) hilbert space via an inductive limit and requiring cylindrical consistency .",
    "interestingly , these ideas naturally translate to ideas and real  space renormalization schemes in condensed matter physics , such as tensor network renormalization @xcite , which recently have been applied to analogue spin foam models @xcite .",
