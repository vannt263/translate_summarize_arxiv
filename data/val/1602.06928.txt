    "the interaction of particles with matter is a fundamental aspect of physics and allows one to measure their properties in colliding - beam or beam - target experiments .",
    "conversely , the irradiation of matter by particles can be used also as a diagnostic tool to probe the static and dynamic properties of matter itself . in soft collisions of heavy charged particles , such as ions , with a solid , typically the electrostatic force , i.e. , the coulomb interaction ,",

    "neglect the precise atomic composition of the target .",
    "regarding first - principles modeling in the same velocity regime , recent theoretical progress is due to time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) , which has been applied to describe the slowing down of charged particles in a variety of solids , including metals  @xcite , semimetals  @xcite and clusters  @xcite , narrow - band - gap semiconductors  @xcite and insulators  @xcite . taking into account primarily the excitation of valence electrons , these simulations yield satisfactory results for the electronic stopping power ( the transfer of energy to the electronic degrees of freedom per unit length traveled by the projectile ) and work for a wide range of impact energies . on the other hand , one can",
    "quite generally determine the stopping power of energetic ions in matter using the srim code  @xcite , which uses the binary collision approximation in combination with an averaging over a large range of experimental situations to provide energy loss and range tables for many materials and gaseous targets . in principle , tddft and srim can include effects of electron - electron correlations on the stopping behavior , either by using exchange - correlation potentials beyond the local density approximation in tddft , e.g. , @xcite , or by including static exchange and correlation contributions to the interaction energy between overlapping electron shells in srim . despite these capabilities , both methods have , however , difficulties to approach _ strong _ coulomb correlations , which are crucial , e.g. , in transition metal oxides  @xcite or specific organic materials  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we note that srim does account neither for the exact crystal structure of the material nor dynamic ( i.e. , time - dependent ) changes in the target during the collision process , which limits its applicability .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to consider an alternative approach to the stopping power that does not have these limitations : nonequilibrium green functions  ( negf )  @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to systematically include electron - electron correlations via a time - dependent many - body self - energy , and it has recently successfully been applied to strongly correlated lattice systems as well  @xcite .",
    "particular advantages of the negf approach are that it is not limited to either weak or strong coupling and that it is particularly well suited to study finite - sized clusters and spatially inhomogeneous systems on a self - consistent footing . while the negf approach is computationally very demanding , in recent years efficient numerical schemes have been developed to solve the underlying keldysh ",

    ", we extend the negf approach by including the interaction with a classical projectile using an ehrenfest - type approach that is well established in tddft simulations .",
    "our goal is to develop a full time - dependent and space - resolved description , which is necessary as the projectile induces local time - dependent changes to the electron density and to the local band structure .",
    "this allows us , in particular , to consider finite clusters of size @xmath3 , which are of substantial current interest .",
    "furthermore , we study the size dependence of the response to the projectile . at the same time , the thermodynamic limit of the stopping power ( cluster size @xmath3 approaching infinity ) is more difficult and expansive to obtain , as it requires an extrapolation of results for different @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain good agreement with existing results for macroscopic systems .    to implement this approach ,",
    "we choose , as a first application , the energy deposition of simple ions ( protons and alpha particles ) , where there is no inter - atomic electron dynamics , in planar two - dimensional honeycomb clusters , in which the electron dynamics are well described in terms of a fermi  hubbard model . to investigate the importance of electronic correlation effects",

    "<S> hubbard models , where the many - electron dynamics in the target are treated fully quantum mechanically and the motion of the projectile is treated classically . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are based on the solution of the two - time dyson ( keldysh  kadanoff  baym ) equations using the second - order born , third - order and t - matrix approximations of the self - energy . as application </S>",
    "<S> , we consider protons and helium nuclei with a kinetic energy between  @xmath0 and @xmath1kev / u passing through planar fragments of the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice and , in particular , examine the influence of electron - electron correlations on the energy exchange between projectile and electron system . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the time dependence of the projectile s kinetic energy ( stopping power ) , the electron density , the double occupancy and the photoemission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that , for a suitable choice of the hubbard model parameters , the results for the stopping power are in fair agreement with ab - initio simulations for particle irradiation of single - layer graphene . </S>"
