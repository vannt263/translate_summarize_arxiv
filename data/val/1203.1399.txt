    "the portfolio choice literature focuses on finding the _ intertemporal hedging _ component of optimal portfolios .",
    "long - run asymptotics have appeared in this literature under different names : the _ risk - sensitive control _ approach , turnpike results and large deviations criteria are all efforts to achieve tractability by means of the long - run limit .",
    "the derivatives pricing literature strives to identify martingale measures that are optimal in the sense of the _ minimax martingale measure _ of @xcite or the _ least favorable completion _ of @xcite .",
    "power utility leads to the @xmath0-optimal measure ( @xcite , @xcite ) which embeds several other martingale measures ; it reduces to the minimal measure for @xmath1 , to the minimal entropy measure for @xmath2 and to the variance - optimal measure for @xmath3 .",
    "the advantages of long - run asymptotics are their tractability and accuracy .",
    "long - run portfolios and risk premia are much simpler than their finite - horizon counterparts and allow explicit expressions even in cases in which the latter do not . in general ,",
    "long - run policies are identified by the quasilinear partial differential equation ( [ emainvpde ] ) which admits explicit solutions in several models of interest . in the case of a single state variable",
    ", this equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation , which is furthermore linear if the state variable has a constant correlation with excess returns .",
    "the accuracy of the long - run approach stems from the bounds ( [ cebou ] ) which estimate the duality gap at any horizon and hence the potential departure from the unknown finite - horizon optimum .",
    "_ long - run optimality _ holds ( definition [ lrdef ] ) when long - run policies are approximately optimal over long horizons .",
    "the main result of this paper gives a sufficient condition for long - run optimality in a general multidimensional diffusion .",
    "furthermore , this condition is sharp for certain models and a calibration to the parameters estimated by @xcite shows that it is satisfied for reasonable levels of risk aversion .",
    "two duality insights are central to our results .",
    "first , the usual duality between payoffs and martingale densities extends to their stochastic logarithms , which are portfolios and risk premia .",
    "second , long - run asymptotics become easier in a duality context because candidate long - run risk - premia yield an upper bound on the maximal expected utility and vice versa .",
    "this observation allows to overcome some difficulties arising in the verification theorems of the _ risk - sensitive control _ literature .",
    "an important concept arising in long - run analysis is the _ myopic probability _ ; a  long - run investor with power utility under the original probability behaves like a logarithmic ( or myopic ) investor under the myopic probability .",
