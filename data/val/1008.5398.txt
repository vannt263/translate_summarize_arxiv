    "spins in quantum dots are good candidates for qubits , due to fast and reliable electrostatic gating , long coherence times , and well known methods for large - scale fabrication.@xcite spin coherence times can be particularly long in silicon devices,@xcite because the naturally abundant @xmath0si isotope has nuclear spin zero , and because si has a relatively small spin - orbit coupling , because of its relatively small atomic mass . isotopic purification could produce devices with excellent qualities for quantum computing.@xcite    recent progress in gaas quantum dots has enabled the manipulation of exchange coupling in a two - electron double dot,@xcite and has led to single - shot readout of one- @xcite and two - electron @xcite spin states in a single dot .",
    "the latter experiment makes use of energy dependent tunneling to provide high visibility in the measurement .",
    "the simplest explanation of this effect is that a larger tunnel barrier causes a slower tunneling rate .",
    "the effect is of fundamental interest for quantum phenomena , and can lead to very precise measurement techniques in the context of quantum information .",
    "energy dependent tunneling effects in quantum dots have also been studied in several other recent experiments.@xcite silicon - based devices should exhibit a strong energy dependence in tunneling , since the effective mass in silicon , on which the tunneling rate depends exponentially,@xcite is relatively large .",
    "semiconductor double quantum dots are tunable structures that enable the coupling of two small regions of bound electrons to each other and , often , to two leads , enabling measurement of an electron transport current through the system.@xcite double quantum dots can display an effect known as pauli spin blockade,@xcite where current flow proceeds in a cycle that first loads either a two - electron singlet state with one electron in each dot , the s@xmath1  state , or a two - electron triplet t@xmath1  state that is nearly degenerate with the singlet .",
    "for the cycle to proceed without blockade in either case , both the singlet s@xmath2  and the triplet t@xmath2  states , where both electrons are on the left dot , must be lower in energy than their corresponding ( 1,1 ) states .",
    "there are regions in gate - voltage space where this is not true , and the striking absence of current that arises in such regions is known as spin blockade .",
    "spin blockade makes double dots extremely useful for quantum dot spin qubits , because it provides a robust means to perform spin readout.@xcite    spin blockade has been reported in silicon quantum dots formed using both si metal - oxide - semiconductor structures @xcite and si / sige heterostructures.@xcite in both cases , the spin blockade results displayed many similarities with previous observations of spin blockade , most of which have been made in gaas / algaas - based double quantum dots . in ref .",
    ", we also reported measurements of current flow for the opposite voltage bias . in this regime",
    ", we observed unusual patterns in two - dimensional maps of the current as a function of a pair of gate voltages .",
    "the most striking observation was a strong ` tail ' of current , which appeared in a supposedly blockaded portion of the current map .",
    "this behavior was attributed to the combined effects of slow triplet - singlet relaxation and strong energy dependent tunneling , the two of which together enable current to flow through long - lived excited states .",
    "for this reason , the phenomena were labeled ` lifetime - enhanced transport , ' or let .",
    "recently , let behavior has also been observed in transport through individual donors in silicon.@xcite    in this paper , we present a large quantity of additional data and analyze these data in detail , showing that they can all be fit using one consistent set of parameters .",
    "we analyze eight two - dimensional plots of current as a function of a pair of gate voltages , four different biases in each direction of current flow through the double dot .",
    "spin blockade is observed in the direction of current flow in which it is expected . for the opposite voltage bias ,",
    "the unusual current patterns associated with let are observed , in agreement with our previous results.@xcite to test the explanation that the ` tail ' of current arises because of let , we fit all eight sets of data in parallel , determining optimum values for the three slopes of the edges of the bias triangles , the lengths of the sides of the bias triangles , and the positions of those triangles .",
    "the results are shown to be consistent with both spin blockade and let . in particular , it is shown that we can not obtain consistent results for the length of the triangles if the current tails are included in the triangles .",
    "the fitting and the subsequent delineation of the bias triangles also enables us to improve our measurements of the singlet - triplet splittings in both the ( 2,0 ) state , and the ( 1,1 ) state ,    building on accurate fitting of the bias triangles , we investigate details of the strong dependence of the transport current on the gate voltages . within the triangles , we obtain consistent and quantitative fits to the data by explicitly incorporating strong energy - dependent tunneling as well as tunneling through both singlet and triplet channels .",
    "both coherent@xcite and incoherent@xcite processes contribute strongly to the energy dependence of the electron tunneling rates , and we develop a general model for transport in a double dot , including both inelastic and resonant effects , using the master equation approach . we show that this model can be used to perform a quantitative fit of the transport data and that relevant parameters can be extracted from the data .",
    "our success in interpreting a large body of experimental data with a single consistent set of fitting parameters is strong evidence in support of the interpretation of the current tail in terms of transport through the triplet channel , as first described in ref .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the blue length @xmath11 is clearly too long , and thus the description of the physics in terms of let and the concept of a current ` tail ' extending out of the conventional bias triangle are necessary to understand the data in panels ( a)-(c ) . , width=326 ]",
    "the key observable feature of let is a strong tail of current protruding beyond the end of the base of the conventional bias triangle .",
    "careful fitting of the triangles to many sets of data obtained with a variety of source - drain bias voltages , as we do below , is a good way to test for the existence of this tail .",
    "however , before embarking on such a detailed analysis , we first provide a simple argument for our let interpretation of the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : simple](a - c ) show plots of the current through a double quantum dot as a function of two gate voltages .",
    "the sample is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] below , and the sign of the voltage bias is opposite to that in which spin blockade would be observed .",
    "[ fig : simple](a ) is obtained at very low bias , such that current flows only very near the triple points.@xcite in particular , the bias voltage is smaller than the singlet - triplet splitting .",
    "[ fig : simple](b ) shows data at a slightly larger voltage .",
    "as expected , the region of current flow is correspondingly larger , and it has the same overall shape . fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](c ) is acquired at a bias voltage slightly higher still .",
    "again , the primary region of current flow is correspondingly larger .",
    "however , a new feature suddenly appears in the data : a tail of current that extends to the lower right .",
    "this tail completely changes the shape of the current pattern .    to be quantitative",
    ", we consider the lengths of the various current features visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](a)-(c ) .",
    "the bias triangles , and therefore the lengths of these current features , should scale linearly with the applied bias voltage .",
    "panel ( d ) shows in green the ratio of the lengths of the main current features identified in panels ( a)-(c ) , projected onto the left - hand voltage axis , to the applied bias voltage @xmath3 .",
    "these lengths were measured , as indicated , from the point where the current peaks at the lower right , to the extremum at the upper left on a 1 pa contour .",
    "the let interpretation predicts that the ratios of lengths @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 to @xmath12 should be equal , as shown in panel  ( d ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which have small error bars , are nearly identical .",
    "further , the length of the tail is the same as the length of the main current region in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](c ) : that is , @xmath13 .",
    "this is also consistent with the let interpretation presented below and in ref .  .",
    "in contrast , if the base of the triangle were located at the end of the tail in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](c ) , the length of the region of current flow would be as is shown in blue and labelled @xmath14 . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](d ) , such a length is incompatible with length @xmath8 from fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](b ) .",
    "note that the length @xmath7 has a large error bar , because the source - drain voltage @xmath3  is so small that the uncertainty in that quantity is larger than its value ; panel ( a ) is included in this discussion to emphasize that current is indeed visible at very low bias voltage , indicating that current flows at the triple points themselves . if the base of the bias triangle were located at the end of the tail in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](c ) , no current would be observed at the triple point .",
    "in such an interpretation , the triple point would be located directly below the tail , and this would be incompatible with the observation of current at the triple point in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple](a ) .",
    "these simple arguments make clear that the let tail does indeed protrude beyond the base of the bias triangle .",
    "the rest of this paper presents an analysis of a large quantity of data , all of which is analyzed together and self - consistently .",
    "the results of our analysis provide a complete and quantitative understanding of the data in terms of spin blockade and let .",
    "the data we discuss here were acquired from a double quantum dot formed in a top - gated si / si@xmath15ge@xmath16 heterostructure.@xcite the quantum well was nominally @xmath17 thick , and it contained a two - dimensional electron gas of density @xmath18 and mobility @xmath19 . the gate design for this device , has a single plunger gate .",
    "for the data presented here , a gate originally intended for charge sensing was pressed into service to tune the dot occupation , providing the second axis for manipulation of the double dot in gate - voltage space.@xcite unlike more recent work,@xcite the absolute number of electrons in the dots is not known , and all references to the number of electrons refers to the valence number ; there could be a closed shell underneath the valence electrons , and the existence of that shell would not be apparent in the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : all - data ] shows the current @xmath20 through the double quantum dot as a function of gate voltages @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "each of the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - data ] contains two features that are similar to each other .",
    "these features are conventionally called the ` electron ' and ` hole ' triangles,@xcite and we adopt this language here .",
    "the ` electron ' system is called so because it can be described in terms of the electron occupations ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,0 ) , and ( 1,0 ) .",
    "the ` hole ' system can be described in terms of the electron occupations ( 2,1 ) , ( 2,0 ) , and ( 1,1 )",
    ". however , these states result in energy level diagrams that are more complicated than those of the electron triangle . a complementary description of transport in terms of the hole states ( 0,1)@xmath23 , ( 0,2)@xmath23 , and ( 1,1)@xmath23 allows us to draw a set of energy level diagrams that are analogous to the diagrams for the ` electron ' system .",
    "this hole picture has proven useful in some situations.@xcite however , it is difficult to include excited states of the zero - hole state in a simple way .",
    "thus , we will stick with the three - electron diagrams here , in spite of their complexity.@xcite detailed plots of the chemical potentials relevant for modeling of transport with both positive and negative voltage bias are shown in the appendix in fig .",
    "[ chemical - potentials ] .",
    "we emphasize that , although for clarity and connection with the existing literature we retain the electron and hole terminology , the chemical potential diagrams for the latter in fig .  [ chemical - potentials ] actually describe three - electron states , not hole states . in this paper",

    "we refer to this bias direction as ` forward bias . '",
    "the data in this bias direction are largely understandable using the conventional concepts of pauli spin blockade ; there are , however , interesting resonances observable , e.g. , where transport through the triplet channel of the electron triangle overlaps with transport though the singlet channel of the hole triangle .",
    "also , the current in the spin blockade regime extends by small amounts past the conventional tips of the bias triangles .",
    "we discuss these features and others in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] below .    the data for negative source - drain bias ( column three of fig .",

    "[ sec : simple_demonstration ] above and in ref .  , there are regions of current extending outside the conventional bias triangle regions  the only regions in which transport is conventionally observed .",
    "we have argued that current is observed outside the bias triangles due to an effect named lifetime - enhanced transport , or let .",
    "the essential prerequisite for observing this effect is that long relaxation times from an excited state , such as the ( 2,0 ) spin triplet state discussed below , can leave open a fast , energetically downhill current path . in order to check this argument and understand the features shown in the right two columns of fig .",

    "we emphasize that the source - drain biases indicated in each figure in this paper have been corrected to reflect this offset .",

    "this rate was not easily tuned , because the device was not specifically designed with a gate for this purpose . however , this is not a limiting factor for future experiments .",

    "<S> we analyze electron transport data through a si / sige double quantum dot in terms of spin blockade and lifetime - enhanced transport ( let ) , which is transport through excited states that is enabled by long spin relaxation times . </S>",

    "<S> we present eight independent data sets , four in the forward bias ( spin - blockade ) regime and four in the reverse bias ( lifetime - enhanced transport ) regime , and show that all eight data sets can be fit to one consistent set of parameters . we also perform a detailed analysis of the reverse bias ( let ) regime , using transport rate equations that include both singlet and triplet transport channels . </S>",
    "<S> the model also includes the energy dependent tunneling of electrons across the quantum barriers , and resonant and inelastic tunneling effects . in this way </S>",
