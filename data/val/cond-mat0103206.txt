    "an efficient statistical description of condensed matter systems and materials almost invariably involves some degree of coarse - graining , whereby a large fraction of the initial microscopic degrees of freedom are traced out , leaving a much reduced space of variables associated with the composite entities or pseudo - particles .",
    "the latter are then coupled via effective interactions which result from the partial averaging over the initial microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduction of the initial multicomponent system to a coarse - grained system with a substantially smaller set of composite particles implies that the resulting effective interactions may involve three - body and higher - order contributions , even if the original multicomponent system involved only pair - wise additive forces , like coulombic interactions .",
    "alternatively , one may wish to retain the simplicity of pair - wise additivity of the effective interactions , but the price to pay is that such effective pair potentials are then state - dependent , e.g.  are functions of the temperature and/or density .",
    "the reason for this is that the effective interaction energy is a free energy associated with the averaged - out degrees of freedom , which generally has an entropic component .",
    "there are many examples of the coarse - graining procedure which has just been outlined . in molecular systems the forces between nuclei result from gradients of the electronic ground state energy surface which depends parametrically on the nuclear coordinates , and adjusts adiabatically to the slow motion of the latter within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "this scenario is mimicked , at least at the level of valence electrons , in `` ab initio '' molecular dynamics simulations pioneered by car and parrinello@xcite .",
    "however in situations where no strong covalent or hydrogen bonding is present , the more common route is to represent the total ground state electronic energy surface by a sum of one - body , two - body and higher order terms .",
    "the one - body contribution is the sum of the ground state energies associated with individual , isolated chemical entities ( atoms , ions , or molecules ) .",
    "the two - body term is made up of the sum of pair potentials acting between molecules and higher order terms correspond to isolated clusters of three or more molecules .",
    "the sum of ground state energies of individual molecules does not contribute to the forces between them , and can hence be ignored in the description of collective equilibrium or transport processes which do not involve chemical reactions . in the simplest case of rare - gas atoms , the pair - wise interactions would include overlap repulsion at short range and dispersion forces at long range , while triplet interactions would include , among others , the axilrod - teller triple dipole dispersion potential@xcite , which contributes very significantly to the thermodynamic and transport properties of the heavier rare gases in their condensed states@xcite .",
    "the effect of the higher order interactions can be approximately incorporated into an effective pair potential , which differs from the bare pair potential , valid for an isolated pair of molecules , and becomes density - dependent@xcite .",
    "similarly in metals an effective interaction between ions may be determined by tracing out the conduction electrons , using perturbation theory or response theory@xcite .",
    "treating the ion - electron coupling to lowest order ( linear response ) leads to a structure - independent volume term and to a pair - wise screened effective potential between `` dressed '' ions or pseudo - atoms , which both depend on the macroscopic conduction electron density .",
    "the two - body level is generally sufficient for alkali and other simple metals , in part because of a quantum interference effect which strongly decreases the magnitude of the higher order response terms@xcite .",
    "for multivalent and transition metals many - body effective interactions can no longer be neglected@xcite , and a full `` ab initio '' treatment may be necessary@xcite .",
    "coarse - graining becomes crucial in the highly asymmetric systems of soft matter , involving macromolecules or colloidal particles , as well as molecular scale entities , like solvent molecules or ions .",
    "the latter are traced out to derive effective interactions between the electric double - layers associated with charged surfaces ( colloids , membranes etc ... )@xcite .",
    "the microscopic ions play a role similar to valence electrons in metals , but with the important difference that quantum degeneracy effects are absent , and that finite temperature entropic effects control the width of the electric double - layers , with a resulting density and temperature dependence of the effective interactions between the mesoscopic colloidal particles .",
    "a good example of a such a pair potential is provided by the classic derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) effective pair potential between spherical charged colloidal particles@xcite .",
    "three - body interactions can be derived in similar fashion@xcite .",
    "however , the averaging over the microion degrees of freedom also leads to a structure - independent , but state - dependent volume term , part of which is associated with the self - energy of individual double - layers , and which is reminiscent of the volume term in metals@xcite ; this term has a profound effect on the phase diagram of charge - stabilized colloids@xcite .    another important class of effective interactions of entropic origin , which follow from averaging over the configurations of non - adsorbing polymers and small colloidal particles , are the depletion forces which have received much renewed interest in recent years@xcite .",
    "depletion pair potentials depend strongly on the concentration of the depletant ; recent attempts have been made to compute the three - body interactions from simulations or density functional theory@xcite .",
    "volume terms arising from the depletion potential picture may have an important effect on the osmotic equation of state , but they are not expected to influence the phase behavior in these uncharged systems@xcite .    the present paper is concerned with a coarse - grained description of dilute and semi - dilute solutions of polymers in good solvent . whereas tracing out the microscopic ions in a charged colloidal suspension has many analogies with the liquid metal problem , the coarse - graining of neutral polymers , achieved by integrating out the internal monomeric degrees of freedom , resembles more closely the case of effective potentials between neutral atoms and molecules , obtained by tracing out the internal electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the basic idea explored here , which goes back to flory and krigbaum@xcite , is to represent a set of polymers , each made up of @xmath2 monomers or segments , as single particles , interacting with each other through an effective interaction between their centers of mass ( cm ) .",
    "the important point , realized by grosberg",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , is that the effective pair interaction remains finite , even for infinitely long polymers .",
    "monte carlo simulations@xcite and renormalization group calculations@xcite show that for two isolated non - intersecting polymer coils , the effective potential between their cm s is of order @xmath3 in the scaling limit , i.e.for @xmath2 going to infinity , while the range of the interaction is of the order of the radius of gyration , @xmath4 , of the polymers .",
    "recently we have extended this investigation by simulating large systems of self - avoiding walk ( saw ) polymers at _ finite _ concentration@xcite .",
    "the resulting cm pair distribution function @xmath5 was then inverted to yield a concentration - dependent effective pair potential @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of polymer coils per unit volume . although @xmath6 was not found to change dramatically with @xmath7 , the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath8 is very significant for the accurate determination of the osmotic properties of dilute and semi - dilute polymer solutions .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a somewhat different point of view , by determining state - independent effective pair , triplet , quadruplet and quintuplet interactions ; these many - body interactions are determined by successively considering clusters of 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 saw polymer chains , determining the corresponding n - body distribution functions , from which an effective n - body potential is derived .",
    "triplet interactions between the cores of star - polymers have recently been determined in a similar way@xcite .",
    "the next step taken in this paper is to relate the low - density ( state - independent ) pair and triplet interactions to the density - dependent effective interactions determined in our earlier work@xcite .",
    "a final section will be devoted to an analysis of three - body correlations as measured by bond - angle distributions and deviations from the kirkwood superposition approximation@xcite .",
    "the convergence of the series of n - body interactions is assessed on the basis of scaling arguments in the appendix .",
    "many properties of polymers in a good solvent are well described by models which ignore all microscopic details of the intermolecular interactions , except their excluded volume . for that reason polymers",
    "are often modeled as self avoiding walks ( saw ) on a lattice@xcite , a model lending itself well to efficient computer simulations .",
    "we consider the situation of @xmath9 athermal saw chains of length @xmath2 on a simple cubic lattice of @xmath10 sites .",
    "the bead or segment concentration is given by @xmath11 , while the polymer chain concentration is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the polymers are characterized by their radius of gyration @xmath4 which , for an isolated polymer , scales as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the flory exponent@xcite .",
    "we also define an overlap concentration @xmath15 at which there is on average one polymer per sphere of radius @xmath4 .",
    "solutions with @xmath16 are called dilute , while solutions with @xmath17 _ and _ @xmath18 are called semi - dilute .",
    "when the monomer density @xmath19 becomes appreciable , the solution moves from the semi - dilute to the melt regime . in this paper",
    "we will focus on densities @xmath20 , i.e.  the dilute regime and the beginning of the semi - dilute regime .",
    "when modelling the semi - dilute regime , it is important to take sufficiently long polymer chains .",
    "the first reason is that for studying the semi - dilute regime one needs a large polymer density @xmath7 together with a low monomer density @xmath19 .",
    "we found earlier that the monomer density @xmath21 at the overlap concentration @xmath22 scales roughly like@xcite @xmath23 for saw polymers on a simple cubic lattice . throughout this paper",
    "we use polymers of length @xmath24 for which @xmath25 at @xmath26 , so that we are still clearly in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath27 the monomer density is @xmath28 at @xmath26 , suggesting that a meaningful semi - dilute regime does not exist for such short polymers .",
    "the second reason for using long polymer chains is that we want to study properties  particularly the effective potentials between polymer chains  in the scaling regime , where all length dependence is completely captured by @xmath4 . in a previous paper@xcite we established that two properties of the effective potential relevant to thermodynamics , namely the second - virial coefficient @xmath29 between two polymers and the effective pair - potential between cm s , multiplied by the square of the cm distance , @xmath30 , are very close to the scaling limit for @xmath24 polymers , the length we will use in this paper .",
    "simulations were done with the monte carlo pivot algorithm  @xcite combined with simple translational moves . for concentrations",
    "@xmath31 we also use configurational bias monte carlo algorithms  @xcite . for @xmath24 polymers",
    "we find that the radius of gyration of an isolated coil is @xmath32 .",
    "we used a simulation box of size @xmath33 , and varied the number of polymers from @xmath34 for the 2-body calculations to @xmath35 , which corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "since we are dealing with athermal chains consisting of monomers interacting only via hard - core repulsion , we set the reciprocal temperature @xmath37 throughout this paper .",
    "following the discussion in@xcite , the helmholtz free energy @xmath38 of a set of @xmath9 polymers of length @xmath2 with their centers of mass ( cm ) distributed according to the set of coordinates @xmath39 , in a volume @xmath40 , can be written as the following expansion : @xmath41 in the scaling limit , each term in the series is independent of @xmath2 as long as the n - tuple cm coordinates @xmath42 are expressed in units of @xmath4 , the radius of gyration at zero density .",
    "note that this coarse - grained free energy includes an implicit statistical average over all the monomeric degrees of freedom for a fixed configuration @xmath43 of the cm .",
    "the full free energy of the underlying polymer system can be calculated as follows : @xmath44\\ ] ] so that eq .",
    "( [ eqiii.1 ] ) can be viewed as an expansion of the effective interaction between the cm in terms of ( entropic ) many - body interactions .",
    "@xmath45 is the so - called volume term , the contribution to the free energy which is independent of the configuration @xmath43@xcite . here",
    "it includes the free energy of a single isolated polymer which is independent of the position of its cm in a homogeneous solution ; translational invariance also implies that there is no one - body term in the expansion .",
    "each subsequent term @xmath46 is defined as the free energy of @xmath0 polymers with their cm positions at @xmath47 minus the contributions of all lower order terms . in other words , it is the contribution to the free energy of @xmath0 polymers which is not included in the sum of all lower order terms . for instance , the 2-body term @xmath48 can be defined as the difference between the coarse - grained free energy @xmath38 for two particles with their cm distance held at @xmath49 , and the free energy of the same two polymers when they are infinitely far apart . here",
    "we use the translational and rotational invariance of a homogeneous system to reduce the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "similarly , the three - body term for a given triplet configuration @xmath50 can be written in terms of only 3 variables ( see fig .  [ fig:3-polymers ] ) as @xmath51 in other words , it is that part of the effective interaction between three polymers which can not be described by volume and pair interaction terms alone . in principle , this procedure may be continued until , for a system with @xmath9 polymers , the @xmath9th term determines the total coarse - grained free energy . in practice , this approach is not feasible because the number of @xmath0-tuple coordinates increases rapidly with @xmath0 , as does the complexity of each higher order term , so that the series in eq .",
    "( [ eqiii.1 ] ) quickly becomes intractable .",
    "instead , one hopes to show that the series converges fast enough that only a few low order terms are needed to obtain a desired accuracy .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of these density independent potentials for our system of saw polymers .",
    "there is a general relationship between the @xmath52 limit of @xmath0-body correlation functions and the @xmath0-body potential@xcite . for the 2-body case",
    "this reduces to @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the pair distribution function .",
    "although this definition resembles that of the potential of mean force ( pmf ) , usually defined as @xmath55 $ ] for any density , they are only equivalent in the limit of infinite dilution . strictly speaking ,",
    "the pmf is not a potential but simply a restatement of the pair - correlations .",
    "consider the simplest case , namely a system with no higher - order @xmath56 interactions .",
    "if one were to use a finite density pmf as a pair potential at that same finite density , the resulting pair correlations would not be those of the system used to derive the pmf .",
    "in contrast , the potential defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqiii.3 ] ) is the correct pair potential which would exactly reproduce the pair correlations of the original system .    in our simulations",
    "we calculate @xmath57 from the logarithm of the overlap probability as a function of cm distance ( c.f.eq .",
    "[ eqiii.3 ] ) .",
    "although the arguments above were made for a free energy in a continuous space , they easily carry over for the lattice model we simulate .",
    "in fact , the cm lives on a finer grid than the original saw lattice polymers , so that our results are already closer to the continuum limit .",
    "the overlap probability is determined by sampling the configurations of two polymers infinitely far apart with the pivot algorithm , and , after every 1000 pivot moves , searching for any monomer overlaps as a function of the cm distance .",
    "the effective potential calculated in this manner has a near gaussian shape with a value at full overlap of @xmath58 for our @xmath24 polymers , very close to the scaling limit estimate @xmath59@xcite , and a range of the order of @xmath4@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v34 ] .",
    "this picture agrees with earlier rg@xcite and simulation@xcite studies .",
    "note that in the scaling limit the potentials depend only on @xmath4 , so that the free energy cost of completely overlapping the cm of two polymers is independent of their length @xmath2 . that this free energy cost at complete overlap should depend weakly on polymer length follows from their fractal nature@xcite , but",
    "more sophisticated scaling theory arguments@xcite are needed to prove that @xmath60@xcite .      just as the 2-body interactions follow from the low density limit of the pair correlations , so also the 3-body or triplet interactions between the cm of three polymers",

    "we integrate over the monomeric degrees of freedom by performing pivot moves . once every 1000 mc steps we move the polymers into a triangular configuration and check for overlap .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : v34 ] . since the total free energy increases with the number of polymers , a more relevant measure of the 3-body interactions is the relative potential @xmath74 which denotes the strength of the 3-body interaction relative to that of the two body interactions . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : v34 ] , the relative contribution of the 3-body potential to the total free energy is quite small , only about @xmath75 of the contribution from the pair potentials .",
    "next we turn to the 4-body interactions . again , even for a homogeneous phase , the total number of relevant coordinates makes the calculation of the full interaction prohibitively complex . to restrict the number of coordinates in our calculations we determine the 4-body potential by placing the four polymer cm s on a regular tetrahedron and determining the non - overlap probability as a function of the length @xmath68 of each side of the tetrahedron .",
    "the 4-body potential is then defined as @xmath76 - 4 w^{(3)}(r ) - 6 w^{(2)}(r)\\ ] ] since the tetrahedral configuration includes four equilateral triangles ( 3-body interactions ) and six edges ( 2-body interactions ) .",

    "calculating the 5-body interaction is even more complicated than the 4-body interaction , and so we only evaluate it at full overlap ",
    "when all the cm s coincide  where we expect its contribution to be largest .",
    "more generally , for any @xmath0th order term the interaction at full overlap is given by : @xmath79 - \\sum_{m=2}^{m = n-1 } { n \\choose m } w^{(m)}(0)\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the normalized probability of full overlap of the cm of @xmath0 polymers .",
    "as long as the particles are equidistant from each other , the same combinatorial expression holds for finite @xmath68 . for the 5-body term",
    "we find that @xmath81 , while the relative contribution of the 5-body terms is given by @xmath82 .",
    "again , the relative contribution of the 5-body term to the free energy is smaller and of opposite sign to those of the 4-body terms .",
    "going beyond the 5-body interaction , even at complete overlap becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "for example , for the 5-body interaction , of the @xmath83 overlap checks , each attempted after @xmath84 pivot moves , only about @xmath85 resulted in non - overlap . for the 6-body interaction",
    "we estimate that @xmath86 mc attempts would be needed .",
    "another problem arises from finite monomer density . as more and more polymers overlap ,",
    "the monomer density increases , so that in practice for a given polymer length @xmath2 , only a finite number of multiple overlaps are possible .",
    "we found previously that the largest finite - size corrections to the scaling limit were at @xmath70 for @xmath87@xcite .",
    "the same probably holds for the higher order interactions .",
    "however , our @xmath24 calculations should still be very near the scaling limit .",
    "from the previous section we see that explicitly calculating the _ density independent _ interactions @xmath88 becomes rapidly more complex with increasing order @xmath0 .",
    "calculating all higher order terms is therefore impossible . in this section",
    ", we describe a way to include the average effect of all higher order terms by extending the relationship between the pair - interactions and the pair - correlations to finite density @xmath7 .",

    "if the original @xmath54 is generated by a system with only pair interactions , then @xmath89 will be independent of density .",

    "( [ eq : v3 ] ) .",
    "note that in this same limit the three - body correlations induced by the @xmath6 reduce to the simpler kirkwood superposition approximation @xmath124 , demonstrating explicitly that in contrast to the 2-body correlations , @xmath6 can not exactly reproduce the 3-body correlations if there is a 3-body interaction present !",
    "in fact , we have shown explicitly that two systems with identical pair correlations , namely our effective potential system and the original saw system , can have differing triplet correlations .",
    "these arguments also suggest that a simple approximation , namely @xmath125 $ ] , can shed some light on the differences observed in fig  [ fig : g3_r0_r20all ] .",
    "since @xmath71 is negative for equilateral triangle configurations , as illustrated in fig  [ fig : v34 ] , it is perhaps not surprising that roughly speaking @xmath126 for the isoceles triangle configurations plotted in figs  [ fig : g3_r0_r20all ] , at least in the region where @xmath71 is non - zero .",
    "unfortunately the statistical errors in this region are very large , making a quantitative comparison difficult , but the deviation is certainly of the same order as would be expected from an extra factor @xmath127 $ ] ( compare with fig.[fig : v34 ] ) .",
    "our very simple approximation illustrates how deviations from kirkwood superposition originate from two effects : * ( 1 ) * deviations induced by correlations generated by the pair - potentials alone .",
    "these have been studied in great detail for hard - sphere systems , see e.g.@xcite . * ( 2 ) * deviations induced primarily by 3-body potentials . in practice , of course , these two effects are somewhat entwined , especially at higher densities . nevertheless splitting the two effects",
    "can shed light on the origin of three - body correlations .",
    "in particular , it suggests that while an effective pair - potential @xmath6 that exactly reproduces the @xmath54 can partially reproduce deviations from superposition of type * ( 1 ) * , it will fail for deviations of type * ( 2)*.    since the 3-body and higher order interactions between the cm of polymer solutions are not very strong , the total @xmath72 s are still remarkably well reproduced by the @xmath6 , especially when integrated quantities such as the bond - angle correlations are considered .",
    "however , for systems where 3-body interactions are strong , such as liquid si or liquid ga , one can not expect the same success from effective pair potentials .",
    "very similar conclusions were stressed by evans@xcite in the context of reverse monte - carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "integrating out the monomeric degrees of freedom to obtain a description based on effective potentials between polymer cm s is a useful coarse - graining technique for polymer solutions .",
    "because simulations can be performed to high accuracy , the lessons learned here should be applicable to a much broader range of coarse - graining schemes .",
    "in particular , we showed that the free energy of the polymers can be expanded in a series of state independent many - body effective potentials .",
    "the terms in the series oscillate as @xmath1 , and become smaller in absolute magnitude for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the scaling theory developed in the appendix confirms these ideas , and can be used to extend them to arbitrary order @xmath0 .",
    "a parallel description of the coarse - grained polymer solution was developed in terms of an effective state ( density ) dependent pair potential @xmath6 , which exactly reproduces the pair - correlations and , in an average way , includes all the higher order terms in the many - body free energy expansion . the density - dependence of this effective pair - potential can be largely understood from the direct influence of the density - independent three - body interactions .",
    "the three - body correlations are also well described by this effective pair - potential picture .",
    "if the bond angle distribution is used , the differences between the full saw polymer system and our effective pair - potential picture are almost indistinguishable . however , this is not a good `` order parameter '' for measuring deviations in three - body distribution functions , since there is almost no difference between results from the full simulations and those produced with the kirkwood superposition approximation .",
    "when we use a more direct measure of the deviations from kirkwood superposition , small differences between the effective two - body and the full saw triplet distributions can be measured .",
    "these arise primarily from the direct effect of the three - body potential @xmath71 , and illustrate a more general point , namely that an effective two - body interaction can never simultaneously reproduce the two and three - body correlations in a system with many - body interactions exactly .",
    "since for polymers in a good solvent these many - body interactions are relatively weak , a coarse - grained description based on effective pair - interactions works remarkably well , at least for the dilute and the beginning of the semi - dilute regime@xcite .",
    "whether this success can be extended deeper into the semi - dilute or into the melt - regime , or even for polymers in poor solvents , remains to be seen , and will be the subject of future investigations .",

    "in a recent paper , von ferber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used scaling theory and simulations to calculate the triplet interaction for star - polymers and found an attractive interaction with a relative strength of about @xmath129 , very similar to our 3-body results .",
    "the natural choice for the position coordinate of a star - polymer is not the cm , but its midpoint@xcite .",
    "however , we will see that for estimating relative contributions , the difference between our cm representation and the midpoint representation is not that important .    here , we apply the star - polymer scaling theory to estimate the relative contributions of @xmath130 to all orders in @xmath0 .",
    "we specialize to linear polymers , which can be seen as star - polymers with only two arms .",
    "we first note that the partition function for @xmath0 polymers with their mid - points constrained to be at a distance @xmath131 apart scales as@xcite : @xmath132 in the limit @xmath133 . here",
    "@xmath134 is the contact exponent which in turn can be written as @xmath135 where the @xmath136 are the scaling exponents for a star - polymer with @xmath137 arms .",
    "these are tabulated for two different renormalization group calculations in@xcite , and can also be approximated by a simpler expression @xmath138 which is expected to become more accurate for larger @xmath137@xcite . comparing the different approximations gives an indication of the accuracy of the scaling theory results .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath0 polymers with their midpoints a distance @xmath131 apart can be found from the partition functions since : @xmath139 \\sim \\theta_n \\ln ( r / r_g).\\ ] ] here @xmath140 is the @xmath0-body distribution function for the midpoints of @xmath0 polymers .",
    "these scaling theories can be developed for polymers in the midpoint representation in part because of the analogy of the overlap of @xmath0 polymers to a @xmath141 arm star - polymer .",
    "such an analogy is not as obvious for the cm representation , hampering the derivation of a cm based scaling theory . on the other hand ,",
    "mc simulations for overlap in the cm representation are much easier than for the midpoint representation because the probability @xmath142 is much larger than @xmath140 in the small @xmath68 limit , in fact @xmath143 while the cm @xmath144 is finite .",
    "gathering good statistics for the mid - point representation is thus much slower than for the cm representation .",
    "it nevertheless seems reasonable to expect that the _ relative _ strengths of different orders of the interactions in the cm representation are similar to those of the midpoint representation , suggesting that the relative probability of full overlap of the cm of @xmath0 polymers scales as : @xmath145 in table  [ tableiii ] we confirm this ansatz by comparing @xmath146 calculated by direct simulations for @xmath147 with @xmath148 calculated by three different versions of the scaling theory . clearly , all three scaling theories and the simulations agree reasonably well with each other , giving us confidence to proceed .",
    "armed with this approximate equivalence of the @xmath149 s in the two representations , we can now fruitfully compare the strength of the @xmath0 body interaction @xmath150 for cm particles to an expression derived from the scaling theory , by using eq .",

    "( [ eqiiie1 ] ) as : @xmath151 here @xmath152 is the coefficient of the full ( divergent ) midpoint - midpoint interaction @xmath153 in the limit @xmath154 .",
    "the values of these terms relative to the @xmath155 term are compared in table  [ tableiii ] with direct simulation results for @xmath147 , and again good agreement is obtained . for the scaling theory",
    "each higher order term is opposite in sign and smaller than the previous one .",
    "our simulations show the same trend for the sign , but the error bars on the @xmath156 simulations are still too large to ascertain that its magnitude is less than the @xmath157 term .",
    "the strength of the @xmath0 body term contribution to the free energy relative to all lower order terms can also be found from the arguments above . in this case",
    "the pre - factors cancel and we find : @xmath158 once again the simulations and the scaling theory agree quite well both for the magnitude and the sign of the different terms .",
    "the good agreement found between the scaling theory and the simulations for @xmath147 suggests that we can evaluate trends for arbitrary order @xmath0 from the scaling theory .",
    "we use the simple expression in eq .",
    "( [ eqiiif7 ] ) which gives @xmath136 for arbitrary @xmath137 , to simplify eq .",
    "( [ eqiiif5 ] ) to @xmath159 the sum between brackets is positive for all @xmath0 , and becomes smaller for each subsequent term .",
    "for example for @xmath160 it is @xmath161 , while for @xmath162 , it is has dropped to @xmath163 .",
    "this implies that at all orders , the @xmath0-body interaction @xmath150 oscillates in sign as @xmath1 and decreases in absolute magnitude with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the relative contributions @xmath164 decrease even faster with @xmath0 .",
    "we expect that the absolute magnitude of each @xmath0 body term is largest at full overlap .",
    "however , the fact that each higher order term decreases in absolute magnitude , or even that the terms oscillate in sign at @xmath70 , does not necessarily imply that the full free energy expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqiii.1 ] ) will converge quickly for all configurations @xmath43 of the cm .",
    "for one thing , for an @xmath9 particle system , the number of @xmath0-tuple coordinates grows as the binomial @xmath165 . therefore , even though the magnitude of the @xmath0 body terms @xmath46 becomes smaller with increasing @xmath0 , the number of such terms at each order @xmath0 in the free energy series eq .",
    "( [ eqiii.1 ] ) increases almost exponentially with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "of course for a given configuration @xmath43 , not only the magnitude , but also the range of each term @xmath46 is needed to decide how many , if not all @xmath9 terms , are needed to calculate the full free energy to a desired accuracy . as mentioned before ,",
    "calculating the complete dependence of @xmath166 on all possible @xmath0-tuple cm coordinates @xmath167 is usually an impossible task for higher order @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , some progress can be made by looking at the special case of a set @xmath43 where all @xmath9 cm s are at the same point .",
    "this is simply the situation studied in the previous section by scaling theory , for which the free energy is given by @xmath168 ignoring for the moment the volume term , who s contribution is expected to be negligible@xcite we can ask the question : how well is the free energy described by taking only pair - interactions terms into account ?",
    "since there are @xmath169 pair terms , the free energy with only pair - terms taken into account scales as @xmath170 while the true free energy scales as @xmath171 . including only the pair terms",
    "heavily _ overestimates _ the free energy , a result also found by von ferber _ et al._@xcite . in other words , if one truncates the coarse - grained free energy series in eq .",
    "( [ eqiii.1 ] ) then certain configurations @xmath43 will not be properly accounted for .",
    "however , if one were to use this coarse - grained free energy series to study a given polymer solution , then the relative probability for finding a configuration at complete overlap of the cm would be very small .",
    "on the other hand , for any given order @xmath0 , the probability of finding @xmath0-fold overlap increases with increasing density , so that one would expect to need more and more terms in the coarse - grained free energy series as the density increases .    another way to measure the effects of truncating the coarse - grained free energy series in eq .",
    "( [ eqiii.1 ] ) would be to compare it to the excess free energy per particle for the original polymer solution .",
    "this can be found by averaging @xmath172 over all configurations @xmath43 to obtain the total free energy @xmath173 , as done in eq.([eqiii.1b ] ) . including only pair interactions in our cm representation of polymer solutions",
    "casts the problem into that of finding the free energy of a mean - field fluid@xcite for which the excess free energy per polymer scales as : @xmath174 while the true excess free energy of a polymer solution in the semi - dilute regime follows from scaling theory@xcite @xmath175 whereas including only the pair interactions in an average over all configurations @xmath43 in the semi - dilute regime _ underestimates _ the total free energy , taking into account only pair terms for single configuration @xmath43 at complete overlap of the cm _ overestimates _ the coarse - grained free energy .",
    "this implies that the special configurations where the coarse - grained free energy series in eq .  ( [ eqiii.1 ] ) breaks down do not have a strong influence on the thermodynamics .",
