    "the use of non - polynomial basis functions in the context of finite element methods dates back at least to the early 1980s @xcite . in recent years",
    ", there has been much interest in using non - polynomial basis functions to discretize wave propagation problems in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is the use of plane wave bases to solve the helmholtz equation at high frequencies .",
    "the motivation behind this approach is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom per wavelength required to obtain accurate results .",
    "thus obtained trefftz methods have proved very successful in practice , hence it is a natural question to ask whether they can be extended and whether they can be equally successful in the time - domain .",
    "the most natural way of including space - time trefftz basis functions is within the confines of a space - time discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) method . in this work ,",
    "we construct and analyse a new space - time interior penalty dg method for the second order wave equation , that can utilize trefftz polynomials as local basis functions .",
    "the method discretizes the wave equation in primal form and is defined using space - time slabs to ensure solvability on each time - step , as well as to aid the presentation and the analysis",
    ". however , with minor modifications , completely unstructured space - time meshes are , in principle , possible in the proposed space - time dg framework .",
    "this results in a stable , dissipative scheme for general polynomial bases . for trefftz basis , we prove quasi - optimality in the dg energy norm , which we show to be an upper bound for a standard space - time energy norm .",
    "numerical results in the dg norm show that the theoretical estimates of the convergence order are optimal .",
    "furthermore , the numerical results show that higher order schemes have excellent energy conservation properties and work well for systems with energy at high frequencies .",
    "comparison with standard polynomial bases show that the same convergence order and approximation properties is obtained with considerably fewer degrees of freedom . furthermore , the implementation is less expensive due to integration being restricted to the space - time skeleton .",
    "space - time variational methods for wave - type problems have appeared in the late 1980 s with the works of hughes and hulbert @xcite and johnson @xcite .",
    "first numerical experiments with trefftz space - time dg methods were performed in @xcite .",
    "currently there is significant activity on the topic @xcite . in particular in @xcite",
    "a trefftz space - time local dg method for the maxwell equations , written as a first order system , resulting in a two - field formulation , has been analysed .",
    "the dg method designed and analyzed in the present work involves interior - penalty - type numerical fluxes in space , resulting in one - field approximation in space , as well as a one - field dg method in time , with very similar computational stencil widths compared to the local dg method introduced in @xcite .",
    "typically , finite element methods for linear ( and some spatially nonlinear ) wave problems are based on a continuous or discontinuous finite element discretisation of the spatial variables complemented with standard time - stepping schemes , the most popular of which are explicit , such as the leap - frog scheme , due to the acceptable cfl restrictions .",
    "though even the low order methods can be conservative , for acceptable accuracy when energies at high frequencies are excited , higher order methods are essential @xcite .",
    "compared to these methods , introduction of higher order approximations is much more straightforward in the context of space - time dg methods .",
    "moreover , space - time dg methods , such as the one presented below , do _ not _ require any cfl - type restrictions , owing to their implicit time - stepping interpretation . if a general space - time mesh can be used , a judicious choice of the mesh can result in a quasi - explicit method where only small local systems need to be solved @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this work is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the model problem . in sections  [ sec :",
    "space ] and [ sec : method ] we construct the space - time interior penalty method and we show its stability .",

    "we prove convergence rates for the @xmath2-dimensional method in space , @xmath3 ; moreover , we also provide @xmath4-version a priori bounds for @xmath5 .",
    "a series of numerical experiments in section [ sec : numerics ] , illustrates the theoretical findings and highlights the good performance of the proposed method in practice .",

    "<S> the choice of the penalty terms included in the bilinear form is essential for both the theoretical analysis and for the practical behaviour of the method for the case of lowest order basis functions . </S>",
    "<S> a best approximation result is proven for this new space - time dg method with trefftz - type basis functions . </S>",
    "<S> rates of convergence are proved in any dimension and verified numerically in spatial dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments highlight the effectivness of the trefftz method in problems with energy at high frequencies . </S>"
