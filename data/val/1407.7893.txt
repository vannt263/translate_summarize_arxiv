    "after shipment and arrival of gpi to cerro pachon in chile , it appeared that the tvas lost their effectiveness which is currently investigated by csa ( and the tvas were dismounted from the cryocooler heads for inspection ) .",
    "for the next commissioning run in september 2014 we expect these tvas to be mounted again with a corrected fine - tuning .

    "[ tab : gpi - modes ] shows the extracted modes from their data set in the frequency range from 40 to 150hz .",
    "all recommended masses for the tmds by csa are based on a mass ratio of @xmath4 .",
    "the study was done in december 2012 while gpi was in the a&t laboratory@xcite at ucsc and mounted to a carriage creeper ( dubbed the `` l - frame '' ) .",
    "the first two modes with the lowest frequencies ( 49 and 52hz ) are likely to shift when gpi is attached to the telescope .",
    "this is one of the reasons why no tmds have been installed yet .",
    "the decision was taken to revisit this study once enough on - telescope experience is gained to evaluate if tmds are required . to this point",
    "no tmds are installed and so far it seems that no tmds are required .",
    "the main vibration line in our error budget ( 60hz ) is not on a structural mode assuming that the two low frequency structural modes of gpi have not shifted through the mounting at the telescope in an unfortunate way .",
    "the topic of vibration in general is complex and is a topic prone to misunderstandings between mechanics , opticians , electrical engineers and scientists .",
    "an awareness of context and language is critical in this interdisciplinary field . coordinating a sensible and successful vibration mitigation effort in an effective way",
    "is a challenge and requires its resources and roles such as an interconnected project manager and a `` vibration officer '' .",
    "there is a constant struggle with hard decisions : does it make sense to spend the extra dollar to finish a study that runs out of funding ? and avoiding the `` sunk cost '' effect in a `` prototype '' development environment is never easy .",
    "gpi has the strongest constraints on its wavefront error budget of all gemini south instruments and certainly has risen the observatory s awareness of vibrations in the telescope environment .",
    "the mitigation using an lqg controller for both pointing and focus has been implemented successfully .",
    "this is an intriguing demonstration of how new technologies can be used to mitigate vibration effects from the controller side . in that sense , using the lqg controller , the impact of the cryocooler vibrations on gpi s performance is low if not negligible .",
    "the only exception is the high - order wavefront front sensor of the cal unit .",
    "it is a mach - zehnder type interferometer and the loss in fringe contrast due to the vibration prevents its commissioning .",
    "fortunately , this is not critical , since the basic functionalities of the cal ( keeping the star bore - sight , and low - order wavefront sensing ) are not impacted .",
    "furthermore , the gpi team has developed further alternatives to treat ncpa such as speckle - nulling . and so far , even though other instruments such as gems _ can _ see the vibration signal on their wavefront sensors , it seems that there is no impact on performance .",
    "nevertheless , a `` root treatment '' is always preferable and it is in the observatory s natural interest to keep its `` vibration '' spectra as clean as possible .",
    "recently , sunpower has developed an active cancellation system ( acs ) as add - on for its gt cryocooler series and we are investigating to upgrade our coolers with it .",
    "there is widespread use of tmds for aircrafts , machinery , in the car industry , for trains and railways , buildings , power lines and in optical systems . and certainly there is still plenty of room to make a better use of these devices in the field of astronomical instrumentation and optical telescopes .    a good infrastructure of acceleration sensors is required to effectively understand and solve unwanted vibrations .",
    "otherwise measurements are difficult to obtain and to confirm , and resources of the observatory are wasted in large overheads . in the case of the gemini observatory it seems recommendable to have at least 5 sensors around the cell of m1 ( and",
    "one could dream about having each hydraulic m1 actuator equipped with a sensor ) .",
    "elts will take this matter ( hopefully ) serious , plan for an integrated design and maybe feature a dedicated `` vibration control room '' .",
    "as gpi and other ( xao ) instruments can always be seen as pathfinders for future telescopes and instrumentation , sharing our challenges is hopefully helpful to find suitable solutions in other complex environments .",
    "gpi can serve as a good example for the successful implementation of a mitigation strategy and for how powerful mitigation strategies such as lgq filtering of the wavefront have become .",
