    "ray spectra from both and low luminosity atoll sources have already been reported in the literature [ 2 - 8 ] .",
    "the production of the hard x  ray tails in atoll sources has been presented in the context of various thermal emission models [ 9 ] from which the accretion geometry can be inferred .",
    "the situation is less clear for the sources , where non  thermal mechanisms are invoked to explain the production of such a component , and little , or nothing , is known about the details of the accretion geometry .",
    "we are currently analyzing all of the source observations in the public _ rxte _ database which contain long pointings .",
    "the aim is to create an uniform database that will allow us to make direct hard x  ray spectra comparisons . from this",

    "we report here the preliminary results of this work , with data from 3 (  , , and ) out of the 6 known sources .",
    "we used data from hexte [ 10 ] to search for hard x  ray tails in the spectrum of  , , and in the @xmath620220kev interval and data from pca [ 11 ] to determine the position of the source in the cd and to study the 220kev spectrum .",
    "we selected , from the public _",
    "database , those subsets of data in which @xmath95000s of hexte total on  source time was available , in order to achieve good sensitivity at high energies .",
    "table[tab1 ] shows the selected subsets for and .",
    "the list of selected observations of  is given in [ 7 ] .",
    "we used xspec to analyze the pca source spectra , using published models for ( a blackbody plus a disk - blackbody and an iron line , see [ 12 ] ) and ( an absorbed cutoff power - law plus an iron line , see [ 13 ] ) .",
    "a complex multicomponent model ( an absorbed blackbody plus a power - law , a comptonization spectrum , and a gaussian line ) was used to heuristically fit the pca  spectra .",
    "low enewrgy ( 2050kev ) hexte spectra were fitted by a simple thermal bremsstrahlung . the hard x - ray component ( i.e. @xmath10kev ) , found only in  , was modeled as a simple power - law ( see [ 6 ] for a more detailed description of the instrument and procedure used for data analysis ) .",
    "we carefully verified our background subtraction procedures , specially for , which is located near the galactic mid - plane , where the diffuse galactic plane background up to @xmath11 800kev [ 14 ] is known to vary in latitude [ 15 ] .",
    "we took advantage of hexte aperture modulation to remove this contribution to the background since hexte cluster a measured the background at the same latitude as the source .",
    "source confusion is also a concern for due to the presence of 4u1700@xmath1237 ( see , e.g. , [ 16 ] ) inside the field of view of one of the regions used by hexte cluster b to measure background ( the b@xmath13 region ) .",

    "nevertheless , the detection level was _ always _ below 3@xmath1 in the 5075kev band .",

    "for these two sources , a hard x  ray tail was , however , reported by _ bepposax _ ( [ 8 ] and [ 3 ] , respectively ) , at a level of for ( using the fit parameters given in [ 8 ] ; for it is not possible to estimate the flux from [ 3 ] ) .",
    "our results , thus , can be interpreted in terms of variability in the appearance of this component , as was observed in  [ 7 ] on a 4 hour time - scale .",
    "scorpiusx-1 remains as a special case among the sources .",
    "it is the only one in which a hard x  ray tail has been observed more than once , and by two different instruments ( [ 5 ] and [ 7 ] ) . for , and hard x  ray tails",
    "were reported by _ bepposax _ ( [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , and [ 8 ] , respectively ) on one occasion . from our combined hexte database",
    ", we found the presence of a hard x  ray tail in 8 out of 28 occasions for  , and zero out of 10 and 13 observations of and , respectively .",
    "fitting our hexte data for and with a power - law with indices frozen in the range 12 ( within the values found for those three sources : see [ 3 ] , [ 7 - 8 ] ) , we found a 3@xmath1 upper limit on the luminosity of the power - law component , @xmath21ergss@xmath5 and @xmath22ergss@xmath5 for and , respectively .",
    "our hexte result ( for @xmath23 ) for hard x  ray tail detections in  is @xmath24ergss@xmath5 .",
    "it thus appears that our observations were sensitive enough to detect hard x  ray tails in and .",
    "as we pointed out in [ 7 ] the chance of observing a hard x  ray tail ( in  ) is higher when the thermal component of the spectrum is brighter . from our results here",
    "( see table [ tab1 ] ) , we have , for @xmath25 1.23.1@xmath26ergss@xmath5 , while for the results are @xmath27 0.42.1@xmath26ergss@xmath5 . the same component in  , when a hard tail is detected [ 7 ] ,",
    "is in the range @xmath28 = 4.59.0@xmath29ergss@xmath5 . while comparable values were not given by the _ bepposax _",
    "results in [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , and [ 8 ] ( nor by the osse/_cgro _ results in [ 5 ] ) , it is possible to extrapolate the results presented in [ 8 ] in order to find an estimate of the luminosity of the thermal component .",
    "we estimate that the 2050kev luminosity measured by _",
    "bepposax _ was greater than @xmath30ergss@xmath5 .",
    "thus , one can speculate that the production of a hard x  ray tail in a source is a process triggered when the thermal component is brighter than a level of @xmath6@xmath31ergss@xmath5 .",
    "we have shown _ rxte _ results of broad - band spectral analyses of three sources , with emphasis on the hard x  ray spectrum .",
    "we found no evidence for a detection of a hard x  ray tail in the spectra of and , although one detection of such a component has been reported for each of these sources .",
    "we interpret this in terms of variability , which was shown to be as fast as 4 hours in  .",
    "we found an indication that the production of hard x  ray tails in sources is a process triggered when the thermal component brightness is above a value of @xmath6@xmath32ergss@xmath5 . we are currently creating a uniform hexte database including the other three sources ( , , and ) , from which we hope to be able to better understand the production of hard x  ray in sources .",
