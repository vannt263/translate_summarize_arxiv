    "when a few parts per million in weight of long - chained polymers are added to a turbulent fluid its properties change drastically and a significant reduction of turbulent drag is observed ( see e.g. refs .  1 and 2 for reviews ) . although the phenomenon is known from pipe flow experiments for almost 60 years @xcite a complete understanding is still lacking .",
    "it is observed in wall - bounded flows @xcite as well as in bulk turbulence.@xcite the macroscopic drag reduction seems to go in line with a microscopic transition of the macromolecules from a preferentially coiled near - the - equilibrium to a stretched non - equilibrium state .",
    "the relation of the polymer dynamics at small scales to the flow statistics at larger scales is therefore essential for solving the drag reduction problem.@xcite    the dynamics of single long polymer chains in simple and partly steady flows is already quite complicated and rich with respect to conformational variety .",
    "this was demonstrated in experiments and brownian dynamics simulations . @xcite only recently , a more complex situation was investigated ",
    "the stretching of polymer chains in random isotropic and random linear shear flows  by means of experiments in the so - called elastic turbulence limit.@xcite analytic solutions are possible for the kinematic stretching of polymers in isotropic and white - in - time kraichnan flow.@xcite the polymer chain is there described as two beads that are connected by a spring .",
    "the model is known as the mesoscopic dumbbell model and the entropic spring force follows either a linear hookean or a nonlinear law .",
    "the latter captures the finite extensibility of the polymers.@xcite qualitatively new effects can be observed in a shear flow such as the tumbling , a flipping of the chain in the plane that is spanned by the shear flow.@xcite analytical predictions for the tumbling statistics of dumbbells are possible when the isotropic kraichnan flow is superposed with a linear shear flow at a very large shear rate.@xcite the dynamics of the angular degrees of freedom can then be simplified significantly because the large shear aligns the dumbbells preferentially with the mean flow direction .",
    "although these studies give us a lot of helpful insights about the statistics of the extension and orientation of the polymer chains , the situation in a turbulent navier - stokes fluid is more complex .",
    "the flow structures are correlated in space _ and _ time and it can be expected that they cause significant differences in the stretching history of a chain while moving through the flow .",
    "furthermore , turbulent fluctuations and the large scale shear are intimately coupled to each other . in other words",
    ", one can not consider them as independently adjustable parameters .",
    "an increase of the shear rate @xmath2 will change the reynolds number of the flow and more importantly the ratio and magnitude of the turbulent velocity fluctuations @xmath11 with @xmath12 ( see refs .",
    "24 and 25 ) .",
    "for example , the presence of shear causes the generation of streamwise streaks , that enlarge the fluctuations in the streamwise direction.@xcite as a consequence , we find that the maximum stretching rate grows with respect to @xmath2 faster as recently predicted.@xcite    the present work consists of two parts",
    ". the first part will focus on the statistics of the flow itself , at scales below and above the viscous kolmogorov scale , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the kinematic viscosity and @xmath15 the mean energy dissipation rate of the flow .",
    "we consider a simple turbulent shear flow with a linear mean profile which allows for studying the effects of shear on lagrangian stretching rates .",
    "this in turn will reveal a different regime of polymer stretching in comparison with an analytic model of chertkov _",
    "et al._@xcite the second part presents studies of the kinematics of polymer stretching in such flows . we will demonstrate that the interplay between the shear rate @xmath2 and the weissenberg number @xmath16 is important for the stretching statistics .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 relates the local stretching rate of the flow to the relaxation rate of the polymers . only the simplest mesoscopic polymer model ,",
    "the hookean dumbbell model @xcite , is discussed here . in the present study",
    ", the dumbbells do not react back on the shear flow . as it will turn out",
    ", turbulence is able to stop the stretching of the linear springs , but at a scale that is larger than the kolmogorov scale of the flow.@xcite our approach intends to keep the polymer dynamics simple , but to take an advecting flow in its full turbulent complexity stemming from the navier - stokes equations .    in chapter",
    "ii we present the dynamical equations for the flow and the dumbbells and discuss characteristic parameters .",
    "the dependence of local stretching rates on the shear rate is quantified in chapter iii .",
    "the subsequent chapter summarizes our findings on the dumbbell dynamics where extension and angular statistics are discussed .",
    "eventually , a summary and an outlook are given .",
    "the navier - stokes equations for a three - dimensional incompressible fluid are solved by a pseudo - spectral method using a second - order predictor - corrector scheme for advancement in time.@xcite the equations of motion are @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ( total ) velocity field , @xmath19 the kinematic pressure field , and @xmath20 the volume force density .",
    "the case without shear is solved in a three - dimensional box of side - length @xmath21 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the nearly homogeneous shear flow is modeled in a volume with free - slip boundary conditions in the shear direction @xmath8 and periodic boundaries otherwise . here",
    "the total velocity field follows by a reynolds ( de)composition as a linear mean part with the constant shear rate @xmath2 and a turbulent fluctuating part @xmath22 the aspect ratio is @xmath23 . the applied volume forcing is a combination of an isotropic forcing that injects energy at a fixed rate of @xmath24 and a shear forcing .",
    "consequently , @xmath25 for the statistically stationary case at @xmath26 .",
    "more details on the volume forcing and the numerical scheme can be found in ref .",

    ", we summarize some statistical properties of the flows that were studied .",

    ", we plot the instantaneous snapshot of all the dumbbells that are stretched beyond @xmath38 for the shear rate @xmath39 ( run 4p2 ) . a first glance on the plot indicates no preferential orientation of the polymers and a rather complicated pattern in which they are arranged .",
    "this is exactly our motivation for a more detailed study of the angular statistics which will follow at the end of this section .",
    "first , we analyze the statistics of the end - to - end norm @xmath40 .",
    "similar to isotropic flows we detect the occurance of the coil - stretch transition .",
    "the numerical computation of the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 is shown in fig .",
    "6 and fig .",
    "7 respectively .",
    "note that the definition of the probability density function is chosen such that @xmath44 . runs 2p , 3p and 4p2 correspond to the preferentially coiled state of the dumbbells , i.e. @xmath45 . the pdfs are stationary after a relaxation time that increases with @xmath16 and display fatter tails with increasing shear rate @xmath2 . the dependence on the equilibrium extension @xmath46 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "we find that the pdf remains unchanged , except the very far tails .",
    "for both cases , @xmath46 was taken well inside the regular and smooth viscous range of scales of the flow which makes our finding plausible .",
    "run 4p corresponds with the preferentially stretched case for @xmath43 .",
    "we plot a sequence of pdfs each taken at the times indicated in the legend of fig .",
    "although the small scale stretching is on average dominating the hookean spring force the pdf @xmath47 reaches a stationary state .",
    "one may loosely think of a mean field picture that the relative velocity between the beads scales as @xmath48 . therefore under the condition that @xmath49 , i.e. when the weissenberg number is larger 1/2 , the average inter - bead distance should grow with time .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "we determine the relative velocity between the beads by taking the _ full _ increment between the individual bead velocities .",
    "consequently , the dumbbells get stretched ultimately to scales @xmath50 for @xmath51 . at those scales the relative velocity between the beads scales as @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "hence the growth of separation stops as the stretching term becomes subdominant in comparison to linear relaxation by the spring force .",
    "we add two external scales of our system into the figure .",
    "the integral scale of turbulence @xmath54 ( see ref .  29 for definition ) marks the average extension of the largest structures in the shear flow and therefore the end of the inertial range .",
    "the box size @xmath55 is also shown .",
    "it can be observed that the sudden drop in the slope of @xmath47 for later times takes place at @xmath56 , but at @xmath57 .",
    "note that the turbulent motion is completely decorrelated across scales @xmath57 and that large extensions ( which go even beyond @xmath58 ) become more and more unprobable .",
    "such a scenario is not new , it is a main ingredient of the cascade model of drag reduction in bulk turbulence suggested by tabor and de gennes.@xcite for a well established cascade with @xmath59 a saturation scale of @xmath60 would follow . the mean extension @xmath61 for the later plots of fig .  7",
    "is found to be at about 3@xmath1 , i.e. the saturation takes place on average beyond the viscous scale of turbulence . in our case ,",

    "it is important to observe that the effect of shear can not be merely translated to an effective scaling of the weissenberg number .",

    "8 the pdfs of the individual components @xmath66 for two cases below @xmath67 .",
    "as expected , the stretching in the streamwise direction becomes dominant when the weissenberg number increases .",
    "the extension in @xmath8 direction is always bounded to @xmath68 due to the free slip boundary conditions .",

    "the moment @xmath70 has a finite positive value while the other two mixed moments were found to vary around zero .     for the streamwise component @xmath71 ( upper panel ) , the shear component @xmath72 ( mid panel ) , and the spanwise component @xmath73 ( lower panel ) .",
    "]    moreover , the moments @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are no longer collapsing as for a lower shear rate .",
    "the stretching in the streamwise direction gives not only the largest extensions , but also the largest fluctuations .",
    "when comparing it with a graph of the turbulent kinetic energy of the corresponding run 3p ( see inset of fig .",
    "9 ) , we recognize similar patterns of time variation .",
    "they indicate that the large scale variations of the turbulence fluctuations have an effect on the stretching history , most dominantly in streamwise @xmath7-direction .",
    "for that reason we have to take statistical averages over longer time intervals with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "such fluctuations are known for homogeneous and nearly homogeneous shear flows .",
    "we recall that the scale of variation of the mean velocity gradient is outside the considered simulation domain .",
    "simulations which start with isotropic initial conditions will show a self - similar growth of integral scale and turbulent kinetic energy until length scales of the finite simulation domain are reached . a statistically stationary regime",

    "our studies are also in agreement with recent works by stone and graham@xcite and terrapon _ et al._@xcite who found preferential stretching near streamwise streaks . both cases considered a so - called minimal flow unit that captures important features of a turbulent buffer layer . in the latter work",
    "such preferential stretching study was detected by an eigenvalue analysis of the local velocity gradient along the dumbbell tracks .",
    "the streaks decay due to linear instabilities and become less coherent when the reynolds number increases . @xcite we expect that such pronounced variations in the streamwise extensions will decrease for larger reynolds numbers .    .",

    "the simultaneous statistical information of end - to - end norm @xmath40 and the polar angle @xmath9 is expressed by the joint probability distribution @xmath100 which is normalized as @xmath101 .",
    "figure  12 shows the contour plots of the joint distribution @xmath100 for runs 2p and 3p .",
    "now , @xmath102 $ ] because the dynamics is invariant under the transformation @xmath103 ( which we verified in our simulations ) .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath40 at a fixed polar angle is given by vertical cuts in the two - parameter plane .",
    "for @xmath84 ( upper panel of fig .",
    "12 ) , the contour levels in the vertical direction are very close and insensitive to the polar angle .",
    "a low weissenberg number at this shear rate is consistent with close spacing of the contours in @xmath40 direction and indicates a rapid decrease of the extension probability .",
    "moreover , the decay of @xmath100 with @xmath40 at fixed @xmath9 is more or less similar for the majority of polar directions .",
    "recall that a larger polar angle @xmath9 means that dumbbells are less aligned with the @xmath7-@xmath8 shear plane .",
    "consequently , orientations aligned with the shear plane and off that plane are equally probable . for @xmath77 ( lower panel of fig .",
    "12 ) , the contour level spacing in the @xmath40 direction is larger , obviously a result of the increase of weissenberg number .",
    "the other feature is that the projected distributions along the @xmath40 direction decrease more rapidly with increasing the polar angle @xmath9 .",
    "this manifests the increase of the anisotopy in @xmath9 direction .",
    "therefore the dumbbells aligned with @xmath7-@xmath8 shear plane are highly stretched only .    to demonstrate this effect ,",
    "an instantaneous snapshot of the most extended dumbbells for run 4p2 is shown in fig .  13 .",
    "again , dumbbells with @xmath37 are plotted only , but now in two different sectors of the polar angle .",
    "a preferential alignment of the dumbbells with smaller polar angles - sector @xmath104 is compared with sector @xmath105 - can be clearly detected from both panels ( see also fig .  5 ) .",
    "figure  14 shows the probability distribution of polar angle , @xmath106 the comparison of run 4p with runs 2p and 3p shows that the number of dumbbells aligned with the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane increases with shear rate .",
    "this is reflected in the increasing maximum of the probability distribution around @xmath107 .     and @xmath108 degrees .",
    "lower panel : dumbbells for @xmath37 and @xmath109 degrees . ]     for the three runs 2p , 3p , 4p as given in tab .  3 .",
    "we present numerical studies of the stretching of hookean dumbbells in turbulent flows with different mean shear rates which are described by the navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "the flow at hand is the simplest statistically stationary turbulent shear flow , a nearly homogeneous shear flow with a linear mean profile .",
    "it can be thought as the flow in the bulk of a turbulent shear flow with no - slip boundaries , e.g. in a turbulent plane couette flow . beside the turbulence structures above the kolmogorov scale @xmath1",
    ", the dumbbell dynamics around their equilibrium distance @xmath110 is well resolved .",
    "the latter is important for the lower weissenberg numbers where the majority of dumbbells remain below the viscous scale .",
    "this constraint clearly limits the accessible range of reynolds numbers .    in the first part , we studied the stretching properties of the flow that are quantified by the largest finite - time lyapunov exponent . for larger values of @xmath2",
    "our results infer that @xmath4 which is consistent with a simple dimensional analysis .",
    "our studies and further supplementary data from other shear flows show that the corrsin parameter does not get much larger than unity ( in fact our data are all below 1 ) .",
    "this point is important since it determines which flow time scale has to be compared with the relaxation time of the polymer chains . in our study",
    "the relevant time scale is @xmath111 , in contrast to @xmath112 as in a recent analytical model.@xcite    in the second part of the work , we studied the shear rate dependence of the stretching properties of hookean dumbbells .",
    "the growth of anisotropy with shear rate is quantified by measuring the statistics of @xmath66 , the azimuthal angle @xmath6 , and the polar angle @xmath9 . when @xmath2 grows a preferential orientation at azimuthal angles that are slightly larger than @xmath86 is observed .",
    "moreover the probability distribution of the polar angle shows a preference for smaller values of @xmath9 with increasing the shear rate .",
    "therefore more polymers align with the shear plane as the shear rate gets higher .",
    "when keeping the shear rate fixed , the alignment of the dumbbells with the shear direction depends on the magnitude of the relaxation time @xmath113 . for higher weissenberg numbers and therefore larger relaxation times a more pronounced anisotropic stretching",
    "is then observed .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath47 is found to be insensitive with respect to a variation of the equilibrium length @xmath46 for most extension scales .",
    "streamwise streaks which are a characteristic feature of shear flows are found to cause variations in the polymer extension fluctuations . in agreement with previous studies for the case of a minimal flow unit of a turbulent boundary layer@xcite",
    ", these structures are found to enhance the stretching . for @xmath114 the hookean potential the inter - bead separations extend to the spatial scales where they experience a rough relative velocity difference .",
    "therefore we detect a saturation of the stretching , even for weissenberg numbers beyond 1/2 and in agreement with cascade models for drag reduction in the bulk of turbulence.@xcite    it will be interesting to investigate the behavior of finitely extensible nonlinearly elastic ( fene ) dumbbells in our flow configuration .",
    "a further parameter , the maximum length @xmath115 of the dumbbells , will have then an impact on the results . in that case",
    "well resolved velocity data below the kolmogorov scale become very important .",
    "this is due to the fact that even for the largest polymer chains in turbulent flows @xmath116 .",
