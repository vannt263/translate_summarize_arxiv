    "with the recent planck data release , the properties of the primordial perturbation has been determined with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "these include the power as well as the bi- and tri - spectra of the density fluctuations .",
    "the amplitude and the spectral index are now precisely measured and given by @xmath6 ( 68% cl ) and @xmath7 ( 68% cl ) , respectively @xcite . regarding non - gaussianity ,",
    "the non - linearity parameter @xmath8 is now tightly constrained as @xmath9 ( 68% cl ) for the local , equilateral and orthogonal types , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition , planck data also yields a constraint on one of the parameters of the trispectrum as @xmath10 ( 95% c.l . )",
    "@xcite , there are several works investigating the constraint on @xmath11 using pre - planck data @xcite . ] .",
    "theoretically , quantum fluctuations of the inflaton have been the main contender for the explanation of the origin of the density fluctuations . with the planck data ,",
    "many inflation models can now be critically tested .",
    "for example , the simplest chaotic inflation model with a quadratic potential seems to be on the verge of the exclusion because of constraints on the spectral index and the scalar - to - tensor ratio .",
    "chaotic inflation with a purely quartic potential appears to be completely ruled out .",
    "while such simple inflation models may be in trouble , other versions of single field inflation are of course still not ruled out . but there exist yet another simple possibility : the origin of the perturbation could be due to a spectator field .",
    "a spectator is a light scalar field with mass much less than the hubble rate @xmath12 during inflation which plays no dynamical role during inflation .",
    "spectators are irrelevant for inflation , but they may become dynamically important after the end of inflation and generate some , or even all , of the primordial perturbation .",
    "the much studied curvaton @xcite and the field responsible for modulated reheating @xcite are well known examples .    as light fields , spectators are subject to inflationary fluctuations . in the case of",
    "modulated ( p)reheating , the perturbations of the spectator give rise to a space - dpendent decay rate for the inflaton , thus generating curvature perturbations .",
    "the field perturbation of the spectator can also evolve after inflation , as is the case in the curvaton model , thus ( partially ) decoupling the observed density perturbation from the inflationary era .    in general , the perturbations of the inflaton and the perturbations of the spectator",
    "could both contribute to the observed density perturbation ; we call such a case a _ mixed model_. for a unified picture of the origin of the primordial perturbation , one should therefore allow for two classes of possible sources : inflaton(s ) and spectator(s ) . one may approach the problem on a general level , but for detailed understanding one should specify the model of inflation even if spectators are solely responsible for the observed perturbation .",
    "in particular , the details of the inflation model are relevant to the scale - dependence of the power spectrum and the tensor - to - scalar ratio , on which the planck data has put severe constraints .",
    "these are the issues we address in the present paper .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the formalism and give general formulas for the power and bi- spectra to investigate mixed inflaton and spectator field models . in section  [ sec :",
    "after_planck ] , first we investigate constrains on a mixed inflaton and spectator field model for a general case , i.e. , without specifying the spectator model , in the light of recent planck results . then , as an example , we consider a curvaton as the spectator field and discuss the status of the models",
    ". we consider both generic inflation and more well defined chaotic inflation . in the final section",
    "we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "let us begin by describing briefly how one can obtain the curvature perturbation and its scale dependence , or the spectral index @xmath13 , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 in a mixed model .",
    "we consider a scenario where there is one light spectator field , such as the curvaton , which together with the inflaton is the source for the primordial density perturbation . as limiting cases",
    ", the formalism given below also includes models where either the spectator or the inflaton is solely responsible for density fluctuations .",
    "more detailed description of the mixed models can be found in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xmath15 formalism @xcite and denote the inflaton field by @xmath16 and the spectator field by @xmath17 .",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath18 reads then @xmath19 where we have defined @xmath20 and so on . by specifying explicit models for inflation and for the spectator field",
    ", we can calculate the observational quantities , such as the spectral index of the power spectrum @xmath13 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 , as well as the non - linearity parameters @xmath21 , by evaluating the derivatives @xmath22 etc .",
    "the appropriate expressions are given below .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are uncorrelated .",
    "the power spectrum is then given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the power spectra for the curvature perturbation generated by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "@xmath1 is the ratio of the power spectrum of the spectator field to that of the inflaton : @xmath26 in the following , we assume that the total scalar potential is given by the sum of the contribution from @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath27 , consistent with the assumption of no correlation between the inflaton and the spectator .    by using @xmath1 , we may write down simple expressions for the various observables . the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio",
    "are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the slow - roll parameters associated with the inflaton potential .",
    "they are defined in the usual way as @xmath31 for later convenience , let us also define an additional slow - roll parameter characterizing the third derivative of the inflaton potential by @xmath32 analogously , we denote the slow - roll parameter for the spectator field by @xmath33 , which is defined as @xmath34 all of these quantities are to be evaluated at the time of horizon crossing .    during inflation , gravitational waves",
    "are also produced and its power spectrum is given by @xmath35 then the tensor - to - scalar ratio can be written as @xmath36    the non - linearity parameters are given by @xmath37 , \\\\",
    "\\tau_{\\rm nl } & = &   \\left ( \\frac{1}{1+r } \\right)^3 \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{n_{\\phi\\phi}}{n_\\phi^2 } \\right)^2 + r^3 \\left ( \\frac{n_{\\sigma\\sigma}}{n_\\sigma^2 } \\right)^2 \\right ] , \\\\",
    "g_{\\rm nl } & = & \\left ( \\frac{1}{1+r } \\right)^3 \\left [ \\frac{n_{\\phi\\phi\\phi}}{n_\\phi^3 } + r^3   \\frac{n_{\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma}}{n_\\sigma^3 }   \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although we do not consider the constraint from @xmath11 in the next section , we give some expressions for @xmath11 for further reference .    with the slow - roll approximation ,",
    "the derivatives of the number of @xmath38-folds @xmath39 relevant to the inflaton part can be given by @xmath40 from these equations , one can see that the combinations @xmath41 and @xmath42 are slow - roll suppressed , on the other hand , the counterpart for the spectator field is in general larger than these .",
    "thus , in a usual case , the non - linearity parameters given above can be approximated as @xmath43 in particular , one can find the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath44 as @xmath45 thus , in a mixed model , if @xmath1 is very small , in other words , if the power spectrum is dominated by the contribution from the inflaton , a spectator field can generated a large non - gaussianity with @xmath44 large even if @xmath8 is very small @xcite .    for the spectator part , to give explicit expressions for @xmath46 , and higher derivatives , we need to specify the model .",
    "here we consider the curvaton model , for which the derivatives of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath17 are given as follows @xcite : @xmath47 where we have assumed a quadratic potential for the curvaton , given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the mass of the curvaton . we have adopted the sudden decay approximation , and @xmath50 is the field value of the curvaton during inflation .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is roughly the ratio of curvaton energy @xmath52 to radiation energy @xmath53 at the time of the curvaton decay and is defined as @xmath54 when the curvaton begins its oscillation and decay during radiation dominated era , @xmath51 can be approximately evaluated as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the decay rate for the curvaton . with the help of the formalism presented in this section , we may now study what are the planck implications for the mixed models .",
    "as a general comment , we note that when a spectator field is responsible for the density fluctuations , @xmath1 should be much greater than 1 . for the curvaton model , with @xmath1 defined in ( [ defrandxi ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath57 from this formula , we can see that the larger value of @xmath29 , the larger the curvaton contribution .",
    "in other words , in small field inflation models , the curvaton tends to give small contribution to density perturbations .",
    "we should also note that when @xmath58 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio becomes very small .",
    "since some large field inflation models are excluded due to too large tensor - to - scalar ratio such as chaotic inflation models with a higher polynomial potential , for such models , larger values of @xmath1 can alleviate the inflation model .",
    "however , on the other hand , as pointed out in the introduction , planck now precisely measures the spectral index which implies a stringent constraint on the mixed model .",
    "when @xmath1 is large , the spectral index is given by @xmath59 thus , to have a value for @xmath13 consistent with the observations , one has to invoke a large value for @xmath29 ] for discussion on the spectral index in a spectator field model in the light of planck result , see @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore , when one considers a mixed model , or even a pure spectator model , one needs to take into account the constraints from both the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "let us first discuss the constraints on spectator field models for the general case ( i.e. , without specifying the inflation model ) with focus on the spectral index @xmath13 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 .",
    "but , before discussing the constraint , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_r ] , we show the constraint from planck in the @xmath13@xmath14 plane , with predictions of mixed inflaton and spectator field models assuming chaotic inflation , from which we can have a feeling how such models are constrained from planck data . a number of inflation models are now ruled out by virtue of the tension between their predictions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the actual observation . for mixed models in general , the constraints in",
    "the @xmath13@xmath14 plane depend on the slow - roll parameters @xmath61 for the inflaton sector , and on the ratio of the spectator - to - inflaton power , or @xmath1 . depending on the inflation model at hand",
    ", some spectators may help them to be resurrected , or alternatively , to be ruled out . for example , when one assumes a quadratic chaotic inflation model , some cases with large @xmath1 ( corresponding to small @xmath14 region ) turns out to be excluded by the planck constraint on @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_r ] ) .    for reference",
    ", we show contours of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , below which the value of @xmath1 is excluded by the constraint from @xmath44 for the fixed @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : eps_r ]    however , the planck data on @xmath13 and @xmath14 allows us to put some constraints on mixed models without specifying the inflaton or spectator model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r ] , we show the 2@xmath17 allowed region ( shaded ) in the @xmath29@xmath1 plane , which is a translation of the constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to obtain @xmath13",
    ", we here assume that the mass of the spectator should be much smaller than the hubble parameter during inflation , and set @xmath64 . in order to make the constraint general",
    ", we also freely vary the value of @xmath30 within the ranges indicated in the fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r ] , assuming negative and positive values for @xmath30 , in the left and right panels , respectively . here",
    "@xmath1 is treated as free parameter ; thus fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r ] is applicable to any general spectator field model .",
    "when @xmath65 , i.e. , the inflaton gives a dominant contribution to the power spectrum , by tuning the value of @xmath30 , a model can be made consistent with planck data except for the region with large @xmath29 , which can occur for a negative @xmath30 .",
    "hence the allowed region is larger for the case with a negative @xmath30 . on the other hand , an inflation model with positive",
    "@xmath30 is difficult to realize in a successful spectator field model due to the constraint on @xmath13 .",
    "non - linearity parameters such as @xmath8 and @xmath44 can not be determined by @xmath29 and @xmath1 alone , but we need to know second order quantities that are usually highly model - dependent .",
    "however , given the value of @xmath8 , we can draw contours of @xmath44 by assuming that the value of @xmath8 is fixed by tuning some of the parameters in a model .",
    "for example , in the curvaton case , this corresponds to a fixed @xmath51 while keeping @xmath1 unchanged , which can be achieved by a tuning of @xmath50 , as can be seen in eq .  .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : eps_r ] , we show contours of @xmath66 for some fixed values of @xmath8 , below which the parameter region is excluded by planck @xmath44 constraint . as discussed in the previous section , as @xmath1",
    "is decreased , @xmath44 is enhanced , which in some cases gives a more stringent constraint .    up to now , our discussion has been model - independent",
    ". however , often many of the model parameters are related to each other in a complicated way .",
    "this can lead to additional constraints . to be specific , let us focus on the curvaton model with the potential given by ( [ quadraticcurv ] ) .",
    "we still treat inflaton sector in a model - independent way . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r_1 ] , we also show the contours of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which both correspond to 2@xmath17 upper limit from planck , for the curvaton model superimposed for several fixed values of the initial curvaton field value @xmath50 .",
    "as mentioned above , to be able to find values of @xmath8 and @xmath44 , we need to specify the spectator field model explicitly .",
    "this is because in order to obtain non - gaussianities , one needs to compute @xmath69 , which can not be deduced from @xmath1 alone .    for the curvaton model , @xmath8 is given by @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 represents the curvaton field value at the start of its oscillation ; a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "we have included a term with @xmath71 for a generality .",
    "however , @xmath73 vanishes for the curvaton with a quadratic potential assumed here .",
    "recall that the planck data yields constraints for these non - linearity parameters as @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "thus some of the parameter space is excluded by the non - gaussianity constraints .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in some cases , a third order non - gaussianity parameter @xmath44 can give a more stringent constraint than @xmath8 .",
    "this is because @xmath8 can be suppressed by a small value of @xmath1 , in which case @xmath44 will be enhanced relative to @xmath76 , as is evident in eq .  .",
    "let us now study a specific spectator model , the curvaton model , assuming a well defined inflation model , which we take to be chaotic inflation .",
    "it has the potential @xmath77 in this model , the slow - roll parameters , the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are given as @xmath78 although chaotic inflation models with @xmath79 as the sole source for the curvature perturbation has now been excluded by the planck data because of the constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , it is interesting to note that within the context of a mixed model , chaotic inflation can still be viable , as can be seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : ns_r ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_rdec ] , we show the constraints on @xmath50 and @xmath51 as implied by the planck data .",
    "the 2@xmath17 allowed region is shaded green , which follows from the observational constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to take into account the uncertainty of the thermal history after inflation",
    ", we allow the number of @xmath38-folds to vary between @xmath80 .",
    "contours of @xmath8 are also shown in the figure . to compute @xmath8 and @xmath44",
    ", we fix the value of @xmath29 by taking @xmath81 for reference .",
    "other than @xmath29 , there is no other ambiguity for the prediction of @xmath8 and @xmath44 once @xmath51 and @xmath50 are fixed .",
    "recent planck data has put stringent constraints on the nature of the primordial density perturbations , which enable us to study the details of their origins . in this paper , we have considered a scenario where the primordial perturbation is a mixture of two sources : the inflaton field and a spectator field , which is a scalar that is dynamically unimportant during inflation . however , once inflation is over , spectators may contribute to the curvature perturbation .",
    "we investigated the mixed spectator - inflaton model using the the planck results on the spectral index @xmath13 , the tensor - to - sclar ratio @xmath14 , the non - gaussianity parameters @xmath8 and @xmath44 .",
    "we first considered the generic case , where the inflaton model and the spectator model is not specified .",
    "we noted that although after planck @xmath8 is known to be small , in mixed models it is still possible to have large trispectrum with @xmath0 .",
    "the planck data rules out some inflation models , such as monomial chaotic inflation @xmath82 with @xmath83 , but as we pointed out , the situation changes when one also allows for a spectator field to source the perturbation . in that case the constraints in the @xmath13@xmath14 plane also depend on the ratio of the spectator - to - inflaton power , which we denoted as @xmath1 and defined in ( [ definingr ] ) .",
    "the planck data circumscribes an allowed region in the plane of the slow roll - parameter @xmath29 and @xmath1 , which could be further constrained by @xmath44 .",
    "this holds independently of the details of the inflaton or the spectator model .",
    "we also noted that the underlying inflation model is relevant even when one considers pure spectator field models .",
    "more stringent restrictions can be obtained if one assumes a specific spectator model .",
    "we chose to consider the curvaton model with a quadratic potential while keeping the inflaton sector arbitrary . in that case",
    ", one may compute @xmath8 and @xmath44 explicitly .",
    "they were shown to constrain possible values of @xmath1 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_r_1 ] .",
    "we also discussed a mixed curvaton - chaotic inflation model .",
    "we showed that in the context of mixed models even quartic chaotic inflation is still feasible .",
    "since more cosmological data relevant for the power spectrum , such as information about cmb polarization from planck and other experiments , is expected soon , the allowed parameter space of the mixed models may be expected to shrink further in the near future .",
