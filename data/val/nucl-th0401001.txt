    "in the production of hadrons at high @xmath2 in heavy - ion collisions there are by now three theoretical collaborations that have shown the importance of quark recombination @xcite . while there are some differences among the three approaches , they all agree in the basics and in the successful interpretation of the experimental data , among which the most outstanding ones are the @xmath3 ratio being around 1 in the @xmath4 gev range @xcite and the scaling law of elliptic flow in the number of constituents @xcite . the differences concern mostly with the treatment of hadronization in the @xmath5 gev range . in this paper",
    "we show how the particles produced in that range arise from the recombination of the thermal partons and the shower partons created by hard partons at high @xmath2 .",
    "the determination of the shower parton distributions ( spd ) has recently been achieved by studying the fragmentation functions ( ff ) in the framework of the recombination model @xcite .",
    "this paper contains the first application of the spd outside the realm of parton fragmentation . as a consequence",
    "we find a new component that stands between the recombination of soft thermal partons at lower @xmath2 and the fragmentation of hard partons at higher @xmath2 @xcite , and is also different from the direct recombination of soft and hard partons @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we have avoided the need to specify the origin of the partons before recombination in order to be independent of the models describing the early and intermediate phases of the evolution in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we use the measured pion spectra to infer the quark and antiquark distributions just before hadronization , and then use those distributions to determine the proton spectrum . in that way",
    "the calculated @xmath3 ratio is a direct consequence of the recombination model with essentially no dependence on the other aspects of the dynamics such as the separation into soft and hard components . in this paper",
    "we do enter into the origins of the partons . the main difference between our approach and the conventional treatment of particle production at high @xmath2",
    "is that we do not use ff to represent the hadronization of hard partons produced at higher @xmath2 . in our view",
    "all hadrons are produced by recombination at any @xmath2 .",
    "ff s are phenomenological functions that do not specify the hadronization mechanism .",
    "although string models can be useful in the description of hadronization of a pair of @xmath6 and @xmath7 receding from each other after being created in vacuum in , for example , @xmath8 annihilation , they can not be applied to heavy - ion collisions where the abundance of color charges renders invalid any notion of stretched color flux tubes between pairs of partons produced in hard collisions @xcite . in the absence of such models to give a conceptual basis for fragmentation , it is necessary to find a meaningful hadronization scheme for hard partons at high @xmath2 .",
    "our view is that a hard parton creates a shower of partons that recombine subsequently to form hadrons .",
    "although the branching process of gluon radiation and pair creation that eventually lead to shower partons at low virtuality can not be calculated , the distributions of the shower partons can nevertheless be determined from known ff s in the framework of the recombination model , analogous to how the @xmath6 and @xmath7 distributions are determined from the experimental distribution @xmath9 of pions , as done in @xcite . in @xcite a variety of spd s are given as functions of the momentum fractions of the shower partons . in principle , there should be dependences on @xmath10 ; however , for use in heavy - ion collisions at rhic , the spd s given in @xcite for @xmath11 gev@xmath12 is adequate , since the dependence on @xmath10 is not severe .    with the spd s at hand , we can now consider their role in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "hard scattering of partons gives rise to partons with high @xmath2 , which undergo energy degradation as they traverse the dense medium @xcite .",
    "instead of tracing the spatial coordinates of the hard partons , we shall use an effective parameter @xmath13 to describe the average fraction of partons that escape the dense medium and are able to hadronize outside .",
    "the value of @xmath13 will be determined phenomenologically , and will represent an independent check on the degree of jet quenching @xcite .",
    "a more important issue is the @xmath2 dependences of the hadrons detected and the origins of the partons that contribute to the formation of those hadrons at different regions of @xmath2 .",
    "the recombination of thermal and shower partons will be shown to be important with the consequence that the structure of jets produced in heavy - ion collisions is different from that produced in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "that difference will manifest itself in the correlation between particles in the same jet .",
    "the recombination of two shower partons in the same jet is the same as the usual fragmentation of hard partons and becomes important at higher @xmath2 .",
    "the recombination of two shower partons arising from two neighboring hard partons is also possible , but will not become important until the collision energy is very high , e.g. , at lhc .    in what follows the production of mesons ( pions and kaons ) will be considered first , and then the baryons ( specifically proton ) .",
    "same - side correlation will be discussed , but only qualitatively to explain some apparent puzzle in the data .",
    "in an overview of a heavy - ion collision we can divide the process into two stages : ( 1 ) the initial evolutionary phase , and ( 2 ) the final hadronization phase .",
    "our concern in this paper is mainly on the latter phase , although what partons recombine depends on the former .",
    "a proper formulation of the formation of a dense medium must be done in full 3d - space and time , but to describe hadronization at large transverse momentum can be much simpler . since the spatial volume in which recombination can occur is small , any two partons that are not collinear can not recombine .",
    "thus collinear parton momenta in 1d are all that we need to consider for the production of a particle with a particular momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the spatial extension along that direction is also constrained to the size of the hadron , so an integration of the remaining spatial variable results in a momentum - space description in which the parton momenta should reflect the wave function in momentum - space representation of the produced hadron .",
    "we can therefore formulate the recombination process in the 1d momentum space only . starting with @xmath14 we investigate the partons that can recombine to form the particle at that @xmath14 .",
    "of course , by not starting with a 3d space from the outset , we can not calculate the density and expansion properties of the soft thermal partons , which will have to be introduced phenomenologically .",
    "a more elaborate formulation can be given in terms of wigner functions in 6d coordinate - momentum space @xcite .",
    "such formulations do provide a more complete picture of the collision process with the added advantage of being able to specify the soft component dynamically .",
    "it should be emphasized that whereas the recombination process is considered by us in 1d , it does not mean that the formalism is insensitive to the realistic problem of heavy - ion collisions and the 3d nature of the colliding nuclei .",
    "we shall return to this point when we discuss centrality dependence .",
    "as far as the hadronization part of the problem is concerned , our formulation in the 1d momentum space is consistent with the result of the formulation in 6d coordinate - momentum space after integration over the other 5 variables .    in our present problem of heavy - ion collisions",
    "we shall consider particle production in the transverse plane at rapidity @xmath15 only .",
    "although the transverse plane is 2-dimensional , we shall consider only the direction in which a hadron is detected so that all partons relevant to the formation of such a particle move in the same direction .",
    "thus it is unnecessary to carry the subscript @xmath16 on all our momentum labels to denote `` transverse . ''",
    "the invariant phase space element is therefore @xmath17 , which we shall approximate by @xmath18 for relativistic particles .    in the recombination model",
    "@xcite the invariant inclusive distribution for a produced meson with momentum @xmath19 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the joint distribution of a quark @xmath6 at @xmath22 and an antiquark @xmath23 at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the recombination function ( rf ) for @xmath26 . for central collisions",
    "it is immaterial which direction @xmath27 points .",
    "although we only consider @xmath27 in the transverse plane here , eq.([1 ] ) has been used in the longitudinal direction in @xcite , where the rf is specified .",
    "it is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the beta function . for pion",
    "it is shown in @xcite from the analysis of drell - yan production data in pion - initiated process @xcite in the framework of the valon model @xcite that @xmath30 .",
    "thus we have explicitly @xmath31 the statistical factor for the recombination process is 1 @xcite . for kaon",
    "it follows from the constituent quark masses of the valons and kaon - initiated inclusive production @xcite that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34-function in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) guarantees the conservation of momentum in the recombination process .",
    "@xmath35 is an invariant distribution that is related to the non - invariant probability density @xmath36 of finding the two valons in @xmath37 with momentum fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 by @xmath40 thus for pion @xmath41 is a constant , apart from the @xmath34-function .",
    "it means that in the momentum space the wave function of pion in terms of the valons is very broad , corresponding to the pion being a tightly bound state of its constituent quarks .",
    "that is not the case for kaon .",
    "the broadness of @xmath42 is an important reason why the thermal - shower recombination in the formation of pions makes a dominant contribution in the intermediate @xmath2 range , as we shall see below .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath43 given in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) differs from the rf given in @xcite , where our formulation of the high-@xmath2 problem is in the 2d transverse plane .",
    "even the dimension of @xmath43 in @xcite is equivalently @xmath44 , whereas it is dimensionless in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "thus caution should be exercised in relating our treatment here to that in @xcite .",
    "it is important to recognize that the rf describes the probability of recombination of quarks ( and antiquarks ) . in the recombination model",
    "the gluons are not regarded as partons that can directly hadronize @xcite .",
    "they hadronize through the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels by conversion to @xmath45 pairs .",
    "thus @xmath46 in eq .  (",
    "[ 1 ] ) must include all the @xmath6 and @xmath47 generated by gluon conversion for the purpose of hadronization through the use of @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the sea is therefore saturated by complete conversion from the gluons , a procedure that leads to the correct inclusive cross section for the hadronic production of pions , both in normalization @xcite and in the momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "the saturation of the sea of @xmath6 and @xmath47 makes possible that the momenta of the gluons ( which carry roughly half of the momentum of each nucleon ) can be properly accounted for in the produced hadrons in any hadronic or nuclear collision .",
    "this procedure of saturating the sea is also followed implicitly in @xcite for the determination of the shower partons in the fragmentation of an initiating parton .",
    "we also note that the conversion of gluons to quark pairs increases the number of degrees of freedom of all the partons in the medium and thereby overcomes the decrease of entropy that one might otherwise conclude by focussing on individual recombination processes .",
    "lastly , we mention that soft gluon emission and absorption are always possible in a recombination process ; in fact , that is how color mutation can take place for a @xmath48 pair to become colorless , while the partons dress themselves to become valons before forming a meson .",
    "such soft processes do not change the momenta of valons and therefore do not influence the momentum consideration in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we do not consider quark - antiquark - gluon recombination with large momentum fraction for the gluon because the valon representation is complete .",
    "that is precisely the reason why the valon model was constructed in the beginning to describe hadron structure on the one hand as well as the recombination function ( for the time - reversed process ) on the other @xcite .      restricting our attention to pion production for now",
    ", we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath49 which clearly exhibits the simple dependence of the pion spectrum on the momentum distributions of the @xmath6 and @xmath47 that recombine .",
    "it should be recognized that , since we work in 1d , @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is actually the number density of pions in @xmath51 evaluated at @xmath15 . with the assumption that it is independent of @xmath52 in central collisions , what we denote as",
    "@xmath50 is equivalent to the experimental @xmath53 , where the number @xmath54 refers to the integrated result over all @xmath52 so that when divided by @xmath55 the average density in 2d is the same as what we calculate in 1d .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) @xmath22 is integrated over a wide range due to the broadness of the rf .",
    "there are two components of parton sources that contribute to @xmath46 .",
    "one is thermal @xmath56 and the other shower @xmath57 . before giving the specifics of what they are ,",
    "let us first express @xmath46 in terms of them in a schematic way : @xmath58 all four terms make contributions at all @xmath2 , although each is important in only restricted regions of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath59 denotes two shower partons arising from one hard parton ( hence within one jet ) , and can be related through the use of @xmath60 to the usual fragmentation that is described by the @xmath61 function .",
    "@xmath62 denotes two shower partons that are from two separate but nearby hard partons , and are therefore associated with two overlapping jets .",
    "@xmath63 is not expected to be important unless the density of hard partons is extremely high , such as that possibly at lhc . for brevity , we shall write @xmath59 simply as @xmath64 , when no confusion is likely to arise .",
    "@xmath65 signifies two thermal partons whose recombination yields the thermal hadrons , usually referred to as the soft component .",
    "@xmath66 denotes thermal - shower pairing and is the new component that has never been considered before .",
    "it turns out to be important in the @xmath67 gev range .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath66 term would be absent if we do not treat the fragmentation of a hard parton as the recombination of shower partons as done in @xcite .",
    "it is now evident that by considering @xmath68 as the showering effect of hard partons all hadrons are produced by recombination , as is made explicit by eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) in the case of pions .",
    "let us now specify what @xmath69 and @xmath68 represent .",
    "@xmath69 is the thermal component including hydrodynamical flow .",
    "it is not our intention to derive soft parton distribution from hydrodynamics .",
    "we shall simply assume what is necessary to give rise to the observed distribution of pions for @xmath70 gev .",
    "since the observed @xmath50 at low @xmath19 is exponential , the necessary invariant parton distribution for the thermal component is @xmath71 where @xmath16 is the inverse slope enhanced by flow .",

    "@xmath72 would depend on centrality .",

    "let the parton @xmath78 be scattered into the transverse plane at rapidity @xmath79 with probability @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the transverse momenta of the parton .",
    "we shall use the parametrization of @xmath83 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained for the study of dilepton production in central collision of gold nuclei at @xmath84 gev . due to energy loss of the partons in the dense medium , not all partons emerge from the reaction zone to hadronize outside . only a fraction of them",

    "note that we do not refer to them as jets , since the notion of jets presupposes that a hard parton fragments into a jet of hadrons .",
    "that supposition is , of course , just what we want to avoid .",
    "we regard @xmath13 as an effective fraction because we do not consider its dependence on @xmath82 and do not delve into the space - time properties of the hard scattering and subsequent evolution .",
    "the value of @xmath13 will be determined phenomenologically , and be regarded as an empirical quantification of the degree of energy loss .",
    "the hard parton @xmath78 at momentum @xmath82 creates a parton shower .",

    "@xmath97 the light ( strange ) sea quarks in a quark - initiated shower , and @xmath98 the light ( strange ) sea quarks in a gluon - initiated shower .",

    "that assumption is invalid for @xmath153 gev , since the production of proton is known to be roughly equal to that of pion in the @xmath154 gev region .",
    "nevertheless , it is illuminating to see what the pion component gives ( call it @xmath152 ) relative to the experimental @xmath150 for @xmath155 gev . since @xmath156 recombination is just the fragmentation component in @xmath129 collisions as stated in eq.([15 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath157 simply by omitting the factor @xmath13 from @xmath158 .",
    "that is , we have @xmath159 where the numerator corresponds to the solid line in fig .  1 and @xmath158 corresponds to the line with open circles in the same figure . the result for @xmath152 is shown in fig .  3 by the solid line , which is in reasonable agreement with the data on @xmath150 @xcite that is not limited to the pions .",
    "it is now clear that the ratio of those two lines is equal to the ratio @xmath160 , which in turn is approximately equal to @xmath161 .",
    "since the thermal - thermal recombination is negligible for @xmath155 gev , the ratio @xmath162 is essentially independent of @xmath13 . thus @xmath160 is roughly independent of energy loss and therefore of centrality .",
    "it is worth remarking on how the nuclear - size effect enters into our one - dimensional treatment of the hadronization process .",
    "we emphasize that hadronization occurs outside the volume of dense matter and along the direction of the detected particle .",
    "the 3d nuclear - size effect influences the properties of the partons _ before _ they enter into the interaction region for hadronization , and is therefore not explicitly present in the recombination formula .",
    "the recombining partons are either the soft thermal ones or the semi - hard shower partons .",
    "centrality obviously affects the magnitude of the thermal source , i.e. , @xmath72 , and the degree of energy loss , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "we have made preliminary study of the centrality dependence of @xmath50 and found agreement with the data by appropriate adjustment of @xmath72 and @xmath13 in essentially the same way as we have done in this paper for the most central collisions .",
    "we mention this only to point out that the 1d description of recombination does not preclude the possibility of accounting for the nuclear - size effect , which is manifestly 3d , but occurs prior to the hadronization process .    the suppression factor @xmath13 , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) , can not be measured directly .",
    "there is , however , a measurable quantity that is closely related to @xmath13 . since only the hard partons that are created near the surface of the collision region can get out",
    ", most jets detected in @xmath129 collisions do not have a partner in the opposite direction .",
    "that does not mean the non - existence of back - to - back jets .",
    "a pair of hard partons that are created near the edge , but directed at around @xmath163 relative to the radial position of creation measured from the center , and yet remain in the transverse plane ( i.e. , roughly tangent to the cylinder ) , do not go through the bulk of the medium .",
    "those two hard partons can then lead to back - to - back jets that are detectable .",
    "it is then of interest to measure the total number of events that contain back - to - back jets .",
    "let @xmath164 be the ratio of events with back - to - back jets to the total number of events containing any jets , where @xmath165 is the minimum value of that any particle must have to be counted as part of a jet .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath166 gev , @xmath164 refers to the fraction of events containing two particles with @xmath167 gev in opposite directions out of all events with any particle having @xmath167 gev .",
    "@xmath164 is then a measure of the fraction of space near the surface that can give rise to particles at high through thermal - shower recombination .",
    "it can have dependence on centrality .",
    "the precise relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath168 is a separate problem worthy of detailed investigation , especially if the experimental determination of @xmath168 is forthcoming .    in a monte carlo calculation , such as that employed in @xcite , where space - time trajectories of the hard partons are tracked , it is possible to compute the parton momenta after energy losses are taken into account . those emergent partons then generate shower partons whose recombination with thermal partons presumably results in a yield that can check the value of our mean suppression factor @xmath13 . in our treatment in the momentum space only , we determine @xmath13 by fitting the pion data , but once fixed the relative magnitude between @xmath66 and @xmath156 is also fixed .",

    "shower partons @xmath255 at small momentum fraction @xmath102 are known to have high density .",
    "they are shown in fig .  2 of ref .",

    "the high density at low @xmath248 renders @xmath253 to be of the same order as @xmath258 in @xmath129 collision , resulting in an increase of the @xmath259 distribution in @xmath1 collisions .",

    "the drawback in using as a measure of same - side correlation is that it involves integrations in both @xmath233 and @xmath243 , a procedure that is likely to suppress the distinctive features of thermal - shower recombination .",
    "it is recommended that the momenta of all particles in a jet are projected along the trigger momentum , @xmath244 , and then the distribution in those projected momenta , @xmath243 , is determined for several values of @xmath244 .",
    "by showing the importance of considering shower partons created by hard partons , we have called into question the conventional paradigm in particle production at high in heavy - ion collisions .",

    "the phenomenon of energy loss of partons traversing dense medium can be related to experimental observables only by means of some valid model of hadronization that connects the partons to hadrons .",
    "if fragmentation is not important in the region of under investigation , then serious modification of the quantitative implications of jet quenching must be considered , since the content of a jet has been altered from that produced in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "what such a modification should be has not been studied in this paper .",
    "we have only used an effective parameter @xmath13 to account for the fact that not all hard partons can get out of the dense medium to hadronize .",

    "yet we have found consistency in being able to reproduce the spectra of pion , kaon , and proton . a more detailed investigation that tracks",
    "the space - time history of the produced partons would require an evolution code that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "particles that are formed by thermal - shower recombination are part of a jet produced in heavy - ion collisions but are not present in jets in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "thus the structures of jets produced in @xmath129 and @xmath1 collisions are different .",
    "to find evidences for such differences is of paramount importance in both experimental and theoretical work to follow .",
    "the ratio discussed in sec .",
    "4 on same - side correlation reveals a limited glimpse of that difference .",
    "we have suggested that the measurement of 2-particle inclusive distribution at high would provide a more accurate description of the jet structure and can be used to check the prediction that can be made in our framework .    at this point",
    "the single - particle spectra that we have considered provide sufficient encouragement from the agreement with existing data to suggest that the recombination approach has captured the essence of hadronization at any and that shower partons play an important role in the process .",
