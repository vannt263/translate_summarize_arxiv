    "surface layering at metallic liquid - vapor interfaces was suggested in the early eighties by monte carlo simulations of alkali metal liquid surfaces @xcite .",
    "subsequently , more elaborate monte carlo techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) , experimental measurements @xcite and recent ab initio molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite , have established that the ionic density profile of liquid metals across the interface shows oscillations that decay into the bulk liquid after , on average , three to four layers .",
    "the use of ab initio md simulations in these studies is important for two reasons .",
    "first , being ab initio , the valence electrons and the ions are treated on the same footing , with the ions reacting consistently to the large spatial variations undergone by the electronic density when moving from the liquid to the vapor .",
    "second , being md simulations , a study of the motion of the atoms can be carried out directly and changes across the interface can be analyzed .",
    "this type of study has not yet been undertaken , as far as we know , basically because most of the simulations of liquid metallic surfaces were carried out using the monte carlo method , which gives no information about the dynamic properties of the system studied .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to fill this gap , reporting a study of the atomic motion in the liquid - vapor interfaces of li , na , k , rb , cs , mg , ba , al , tl , si , and the na@xmath0k@xmath1 alloy , using slabs with 2000 atoms .",
    "layering also appears for metals at the solid - liquid interface @xcite , for liquids in contact with a hard wall @xcite , or in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "moreover , for ultrathin films of large molecules in contact with a si wall @xcite and for confined dusty plasma liquids @xcite it has been possible to follow experimentally the molecular motion , whereas in the solid - liquid interface ab initio md simulations allowed to study the atomic diffusion at the interface @xcite . in all cases reduced diffusion with respect to the bulk was found .",
    "these oscillating profiles are in contrast with those of the liquid - vapor interfaces of one - component dielectrics , like water or lennard - jones ( lj ) systems , or those of liquid - liquid interfaces of immiscible mixtures , which show monotonic profiles with no layering . taking the archetypical example of the one - component lj system , we have found in the literature a large amount of computer simulation studies of the coexisting densities , the interfacial width and the surface tension , as a function of the temperature , the particular lj model used ( truncated , truncated and shifted , full potential ) and the lateral area simulated ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , an analysis of the atomic motion in the interface has not been performed yet .",
    "surprisingly , the situation is somewhat different for more complex systems , like water , or mixtures , where some ( scarce ) studies of atomic diffusion in the interfacial region have indeed been performed @xcite . in the case of mixtures ,",
    "some anisotropy in diffusion was detected , either due to an increase in the diffusion coefficient parallel to the interface , @xmath2 , with respect to the bulk value @xcite , or to a decrease of the diffusion coefficient normal to the interface , @xmath3 , @xcite . following a thorough analysis of the effect of the inhomogeneity of the interface on the values ( and even the definition ) of @xmath3 , molecular dynamics simulations of the liquid - vapor interface of water",
    "@xcite revealed an increase in @xmath2 ( 3.5-fold ) and also in @xmath3 ( 2-fold ) , which was attributed to the reduction of the number of hydrogen bonds in the interface .",
    "moreover , it was argued that the same qualitative behavior would occur for other simple liquids @xcite .    although surface layering is common to the liquid - vapor interface of metals and the systems mentioned above , there are also important differences .",
    "even though the atoms in the outer layer of the liquid - vapor interface rarely leave the liquid surface ( especially at temperatures near their triple points ) , they are not geometrically confined . moreover , in liquids confined , or on a wall , or at the interface with their solid phase , a strong interaction between the substrate and the first layers of the liquid has an important influence on the structure and dynamics of the liquid , leading to strong oscillations in the profile and to reduced diffusion .",
    "it is also worth analyzing if the metallic liquid - vapor interface , in particular the outer layer , behaves like a quasi two - dimensional system .",
    "there are some liquid alloys ( ga with small amounts of tl , pb or bi ) where the minority component , which has a high melting temperature and segregates to the surface , displays this kind of behavior ( see , e. g. , references @xcite ) . for",
    "one component metals or other type of alloys , a possible measure of the two - dimensional character of the outer layer could be some distinctive feature of the density distribution function ( ddf ) of the time of residence of the atoms in that layer , for instance its mean value .",
    "because of the the periodic boundary conditions used in most simulation methods , a slab geometry is usually adopted in studies of the liquid - vapor interface , with two free surfaces perpendicular to one of the axes , taken here as the @xmath4 axis",
    ". these two surfaces should be well separated to minimize interaction between them . for the metallic systems we have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations , whereas for the lj system",
    "standard classical molecular dynamics have been used .",
    "ab initio simulations based on the kohn - sham formulation of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , pose huge computational demands , and the only metallic liquid surfaces studied so far , si @xcite and na @xcite , used small samples ( 96 and 160 particles respectively ) where the two surfaces are rather close ( 16 and 20   respectively ) .",
    "orbital free ab initio molecular dynamics ( ofaimd ) simulations reduce somewhat these computational demands , by returning to the original hohenberg - kohn formulation of dft @xcite , and adopting an explicit but approximate density functional for the electron kinetic energy so that the whole energy is a functional of the electron density .",
    "ofaimd simulations of liquid metal surfaces have recently been performed @xcite for li , na , mg , al , si and na@xmath5k@xmath6 using 2000 particles and for li@xmath7na@xmath8 using 3000 particles , which led to simulation boxes big enough to reliably represent a macroscopic interface .",
    "details about the formalism and the electron - ion interactions can be found elsewhere @xcite . even though the ofaimd method has been applied successfully to bulk metals and alloys ,",
    "it might be argued that this is not a sufficient validation of the method , as surfaces are different from bulk systems .",
    "however , it must be stressed that the ofaimd studies of na and si , produced results very similar to those obtained by the ( in principle ) more accurate kohn - sham _ ab initio _ simulations : the wavelength of the oscillations in the profiles , which is recovered exactly , the number of nearest neighbors of a si particle across the interface , and the surface tension of liquid na , are all well reproduced by the ofaimd approach .",
    "further confidence in the ability of the methd to tackle metallic surfaces can be obtained from studies for finite systems , where the surface plays an essential role .",
    "for instance , a long standing and previously unexplained anomalous variation of the melting temperatures of na clusters with size @xcite has been reproduced and rationalized for the first time in terms of the surface geometry and stability @xcite using the same ofaimd method as in this paper .",
    "even furher confidence in the capabilities of the method , concerning specifically semiintinite surfaces , can be gained from preliminary results @xcite obtained for the temperature dependent surface relaxation of al(@xmath9 ) and mg(@xmath10 ) , which reproduce qualitatively both experimental data and previous kohn - sham calculations .",
    "the lj system has been simulated at a reduced temperature @xmath11 , which is near its triple point , in order to compare with the metallic systems in a similar thermodynamic state .",
    "we have made simulations with 1960 particles , similar to the metals , and also with 15680 particles in order to reassess the results for the smaller system .",
    "the lateral side for the small system is @xmath12 , which is already large enough to suppress the unrealistic oscillatory behaviour of the interfacial properties due to periodic boundary conditions @xcite . for the large system",
    "the lateral side is doubled ( @xmath13 ) so the expected effects on the interfacial properties are only those of the enhanced capillary waves which should produce a wider interface than in the small system .    for all systems , the number of @xmath14 equilibrium configurations used for averaging ranged between 20000 and 30000 .",
    "figure [ layers ] shows the ionic density profile obtained for liquid si and the partial and total ionic density profiles for the liquid alloy na@xmath0k@xmath1 , while that of the lj system is depicted in figure [ lj ] .",
    "the layers where the ionic motion was studied , which for metals were located between consecutive minima in the total ionic density profile , are also indicated .",
    "the outermost layer ( numbered 1 ) comprises from the last minimum to the inflection point of the decaying profile . for layers 1 , 2 and 3",
    "the results of the two layers on opposite sides of the slab were averaged .",
    "further structural details of the interfaces of these systems will be given elsewhere @xcite , but we note here that the relative amplitudes of the outermost oscillation for the alkalis and alkaline - earths are rather similar ( maxima from 1.00 to 1.13 , minima from 0.80 to 0.88 ) while they increase significantly for the systems of valence 3 and 4 ( maxima 1.29 , 1.47 and 1.56 , minima 0.73 , 0.69 and 0.54 for al , si and tl respectively ) .",
    "the width of the different layers is very small , of the order of one atomic diameter .",
    "therefore it is not appropriate to talk about diffusion along the direction normal to the interface within a layer , as there is no room for a particle within the layer to reach that type of motion .",
    "figure [ movim ] shows the time evolution of the @xmath4 coordinate of one particular al atom and an oscillatory - type motion within the layers can be seen followed by jumps into adjacent layers .",
    "the trajectory of the particle , projected onto the @xmath15 and @xmath16 planes is also shown in the figure . to provide a meaningful comparison among the results for different systems , with diverse masses and potentials , and consequently different characteristic times , a reference time ,",
    "@xmath17 , has been defined for each system which is to be used as a time unit ( see table [ tablilla ] ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath17 has been taken as the first value of @xmath18 for which the mean square displacement ( msd ) in the bulk liquid has an inflection point , which is an indication of the atomic motion changing from free - particle to diffusive like behavior .    the ionic density profile for the large lj system is shown in figure [ lj ] .",
    "for this type of system , the definition of  layers \" in order to analyze atomic motion is basically arbitrary .",
    "we have chosen to define them in a similar way as we have done for metals in order to make the comparison as fair as possible .",
    "first we have fitted the simulation results to an error function profile , @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the coexisting densities of the liquid and the vapor , @xmath22 is the position of the interface , which coincides with the inflection point of the profile , and @xmath23 its width ) , which appears to be more adequate than the usual hyperbolic tangent one @xcite .",
    "the widths for the small and large lj systems are @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , the latter being larger as expected from the increased number of capillary waves . in the following",
    "we will present the results obtained for the large system , which , appart from this interfacial width , are practically coincident with those of the small system .",
    "layer number 1 is then defined as a slice of width @xmath26 from the inflection point towards the liquid .",
    "further slices of width @xmath26 towards the liquid are then taken as layers 2 and 3 .",
    "note that , defined this way , the layers of the lj system are also very thin ( @xmath27 ) , so we are in a similar situation as in metals , where we consider that diffusion is only possible within the layers parallel to the interface .",
    "the reference time @xmath17 for the lj system is finally defined in the same way as for metals , and is also shown in table [ tablilla ] .",
    "in order to analyze the diffusive motion within the layers , the msd along the @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions has been calculated for those particles that remain inside the layer for a large enough time ( @xmath30 ) , a criterion somewhat different from , although in the same spirit as others used in previous works @xcite .",
    "the selection of @xmath30 is somewhat delicate , as @xmath30 must be large enough so that diffusive motion has already set in , but the number of particles that remain in a layer for at least @xmath30 decreases as @xmath30 increases , leading to poorer statistics .",
    "a good compromise was found to be @xmath31 , defined so that the probability of residence in the layer for times larger than @xmath32 is 20 % .",
    "all the data shown below were obtained with this criterion , but checks showed that other reasonable choices for @xmath30 led to statistically equivalent results . in order to compute @xmath32 , and also to characterize the motion along the @xmath4-direction , the residence time of particles in each of the layers was studied .",
    "for all the systems considered , including the metals and the lj system , the ddf of the residence time , @xmath33 , has been computed for the three outer layers ( the case of ba is shown in figure [ probab ] ) , and some common features can be identified .",
    "the maximum of @xmath33 occurs at very small @xmath18-values , ( @xmath34 @xmath17 ) , suggesting that most of the particles attempting to enter the layer are bounced back .",
    "also , the ddf exhibits a long time tail , which gives rise to mean residence times ( mrt ) , @xmath35 , which increase when moving from the bulk liquid towards the outer layers ( see table [ tablilla ] ) . in the lj system",
    "this increase is rather small , amounting to approximately a 10 % .",
    "for the metals , however , the mrt at the outermost layer is strongly enhanced , with increases between 75 % ( for na ) and 246 % ( for tl ) , while the values taken at layer 2 show a more modest increase of around 10 % .",
    "this large discrepancy between the behavior of the lj system and that of metals precludes any simple geometrical interpretation of the results and underlines that the change of interactions at the liquid - vapor interface of metals does have an important influence on some dynamic properties of the surface .",
    "moreover , these results indicate that the outermost layer in metals behaves more bidimensional - like than the inner ones .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mrt is around 20@xmath17 for the alkalis and alkaline - earths , whereas it increases in al ( @xmath36 ) and tl ( @xmath37 ) , but not in si .    in order to rationalize these differences among metals ,",
    "we consider how the atoms move from one layer to another .",
    "the minima in the density profiles suggest the existence of an interlayer potential barrier , which would be higher the lower the minimum of the density profile .",
    "therefore this barrier would increase significantly from the alkalis and alkaline - earths to al , to si , and finally to tl .",
    "the probability of overcoming this barrier would be related both to its height and to the frequency with which the atoms attempt to cross .",
    "this frequency has been estimated as proportional to the einstein frequency along the @xmath4 direction , @xmath38 , which is shown in table [ tablilla ] together with the corresponding frequency in the direction parallel to the interface , @xmath39 , for completeness .",
    "these have been obtained from a short time ( up to @xmath40 ) expansion of the corresponding msd @xcite .",
    "we find , in terms of @xmath17 , a rather universal value for all the systems except for si , whose more open structure leads to higher einstein frequencies .",
    "therefore , the increase in the mrt of al and tl is related to the increased barrier height , whereas in si the increased barrier height is counterbalanced by an increased einstein frequency , leading to mrt similar to those of alkalis and alkaline - earths .",
    "the absence of well defined layers in the lj profile suggests that the motion perpendicular to the interface is much easier than in metals , as no barriers are present , and therefore the position of our arbitrarily defined  layers \" has very little influence on the mrt .",
    "similar trends are also obtained for the liquid na@xmath0k@xmath1 alloy , although surface segregation leads to an outer layer of almost pure k so that na - related quantities are really irrelevant .",
    "indeed the outermost na layer comprises regions 1 and 2 , and therefore the numbers shown in table [ tablilla ] for na in the alloy span columns 1 and 2 together .",
    "the integral @xmath41 , gives the probability that having entered the layer , a particle remains there longer than @xmath18 , and is used to obtain @xmath32 ( see the inset of figure [ probab ] ) .",
    "values for @xmath32 shown in table [ tablilla ] correlate rather well with the mrt .",
    ".reference time , @xmath17 , mean residence time , @xmath35 , twenty percent time ( see text ) , @xmath32 , ratio between @xmath2 and the diffusion coefficient in the center of the slab , @xmath42 , and einstein frequencies for the systems considered and the different regions .",
    "the units of @xmath17 for the lj system are standard reduced units , and picoseconds for all the other systems . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the @xmath32 times have been used to analyse the atomic motion within the layers .",
    "the msd have been evaluated up to @xmath43 , in order to allow an adequate averaging over the time origins .",
    "figure [ r2 t ] depicts the msd for layers 1 and 2 and for the slab center in liquid k. there is a clear increase in the slope as the interface is approached .",
    "this is common to all the systems , including the lj one , and is quantified in table [ tablilla ] which shows the ratio between the diffusion coefficient parallel to the interface , @xmath2 , in the different layers and the bulk diffusion coefficient in the slab center ( where diffusion is isotropic ) .",
    "we attribute this @xmath34 100 % increase in the diffusion at the outermost layer to the reduced coordination of the atoms in the interface . in all the pure metals , except si , the number of nearest neighbors is @xmath34 12 at the center of the slab and reduces to @xmath34 8 at the outer layer . in the lj system",
    "the cordination number again decreases from @xmath34 12 to @xmath34 9 .",
    "for si the coordination number is @xmath34 6 at the center and @xmath34 @xmath44 at the outer layer .",
    "this smaller decrease is reflected in a smaller enhancement of the diffusion coefficient at the interface of only 24 % .",
    "a similar explanation also holds for the na@xmath0k@xmath1 alloy .",
    "the total number of neighbors around a k ( na ) atom is roughly constant at @xmath34 12.5 ( 10.0 ) up to regions 1 , where it sharply decreases .",
    "consequently , @xmath2 for k increases rapidly in the outermost layer , whereas the value for na in its outermost layer ( regions 1 and 2 ) does not change significantly because very few na atoms in regions 1 are affected by this decrease of coordination .",
    "the case of tl deserves special attention because the number of neighbors decreases from 12 to 8 but @xmath2 increases by only 24 % in the outermost layer .",
    "we attribute this modest increase in @xmath2 in this strongly layered system to a large influence of the second layer on the atoms of the outermost one , an effect similar to that exerted by a wall on a liquid which leads to strong layering and reduced diffusion .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed through ab initio simulations the atomic motion in the liquid - vapor interfaces of several metals and compared it with that of a lj system in a similar thermodynamic state .",
    "although the layered structure is similar to other systems such as liquids on a solid or in confined geometries , the dynamic behavior within the layers is much more similar to the liquid - vapor interface of dielectrics , like the lj system or water , showing an enhanced diffusion in the parallel direction at the interface , which is attributed to the reduced coordination of an atom which favours the transverse movement . in the perpendicular direction , the layers are too thin to regard the motion as atomic diffusion , and instead the mrt associated to each layer has been determined",
    ". the dynamic behavior of metallic systems along this direction is far different from that of lj systems .",
    "the value of the mrt for metals is clearly larger at the outermost layer , contrary to the case of the lj system , and increases significantly for the polyvalent metals with closed structures .",
    "finally , the reference time @xmath17 is found to be an excellent time unit , since it reveals universal values in several dynamic properties of different systems .",
