    "recent advances in nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) @xcite and optical communication technology @xcite have renewed interest in the field of quantum - limited amplification and encouraged scientists working in these areas to design systems which can operate at the quantum limit . the seminal work of caves @xcite set the minimum noise added by a phase - preserving amplifier at half a photon referred to the input channel .",
    "the same work showed , however , that phase - sensitive amplifiers are not submitted to this limitation and can amplify one of the quadratures noiselessly at the expense of deamplification of the conjugate quadrature .",
    "parametric amplifiers where a strong pump wave at frequency @xmath0 causes simultaneous generation of signal and idler photons at frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , are particularly promising candidates to reach the quantum limit",
    ". these may employ either a second - order nonlinear interaction with @xmath3 or a third - order interaction with @xmath4 .",
    "various schemes based on quantum optical parametric amplifiers @xcite operating at sub - quantum noise limits have been tested successfully .",
    "low noise amplifiers in the rf and microwave domains have seen a growing demand from applications in astro - particle physics @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite involving microwave investigation of solid state qubits .",
    "parametric amplifiers based on josephson tunnel junctions ( jtj ) are a front - runner for such applications as jtjs are the only known non - dissipative and nonlinear circuit elements , operating at radio frequencies and arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "experimental efforts @xcite have engineered the nonlinearity of jtj and utilized it to perform challenging measurements like non - demolition readout of superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "a typical parametric amplification process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ badefinition ] .",
    "the amplifier can be visualized as a black - box where an incoming signal ( @xmath5 ) is reflected into a larger signal ( @xmath6 ) due to energy transfer from the pump drive to the signal .",
    "similarly the idler port , empty of incoming waves , gives rise to a spontaneously emitted signal .",
    "the interaction between the signal and pump waves can be understood as a coupling between the internal coordinates of the amplifier representing the signal / idler ( @xmath7 ) and pump ( @xmath8 ) modes respectively . under the stiff pump approximation ,",
    "the internal coordinate @xmath8 is considered to be completely enslaved to the pump amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "as the noise at the input grows , one eventually enters the soft pump regime where the pump coordinate @xmath8 has its dynamics partly determined by @xmath7 .",
    "this interaction between the pump and the signal leads to a reciprocal effect of the signal on the pump - referred to as ` back - action ' in the following text . as a result of this back - action ,",
    "the outgoing pump wave ( @xmath10 ) suffers depletion , which is the counterpart of amplification of the signal and idler waves .",
    "we have analyzed the soft pump regime and the effect of two - way coupling between signal / idler and pump channels in a detailed manner for a parametric amplifier using a single tunnel junction by using a model employing two pump sources .",
    "interestingly , the use of dual - pump scheme simplifies the dynamics of this nonlinear coupled system significantly , a reasonable trade - off at the cost of a second generator .",
    "the absence of this crucial simplification makes a similar soft pump analysis for conventional single pump devices unwieldy .     and @xmath8 . the bidirectional coupling between the internal coordinate at signal frequency ( @xmath7 ) and that oscillating at the pump frequency ( @xmath8 ) is shown using the curved arrows .",
    "this coupling leads , in one direction ( left arrow ) to amplification of the outgoing wave signal while in the other direction ( right arrow ) to depletion of the outgoing pump wave .",
    "it may be noted that this process also leads to a deterministic signal of finite amplitude at the idler port as the pump also populates the outgoing idler wave along with the signal , even if there is no idler input.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +    the quantum optics community is well - acquainted with the use of dual pumps in parametric amplification @xcite .",
    "the josephson dual - pump amplifier ( dpa ) , besides providing an efficient theoretical tool for studying various aspects of the dynamics of the amplification process , also offers practical advantages like greater bandwidth @xcite , tunable band center and additional degrees of design freedom . in the following sections , we provide a theoretical study of this novel josephson",
    " paramp \" and also explore the boundary between amplification and delicate effects like self - oscillation .    in a regular degenerate paramp",
    "the signal is located within a cavity linewidth of the pump frequency which is not favorable for the observation of fragile effects like self - oscillation . with a double pump scheme ,",
    "the pump frequencies lie towards outer edges of the band of amplification , leading to better separation of the pump and the signal frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ freqspec ] ) .",
    "this provides a zero background for detection of a small signal like self - oscillation which would have been otherwise challenging due to the large background of the pump .",
    "the use of dual pumping further helps in the realization of a symmetric phase boundary for bifurcation .",
    "this should be contrasted with a single pump device like the josephson bifurcation amplifier ( jba ) @xcite , where the phase boundary is canted due to a first - order transition between dynamical states of the junction near threshold ( cf .",
    "appendix [ jba_app ] ) . as a consequence , unlike the jba , there is no inherent frustration between the thresholds for self - oscillation and parametric gain in the double - pump amplifier discussed here .",
    "it is this symmetry , unique to the dpa , that proves extremely valuable for the simplification of equations governing the dynamics of the system near bifurcation .",
    "we deal with this issue in greater detail in section [ sec_st_stiff ] .    this article is organized as follows :",
    "we first derive the basic equations governing the dynamics of the dpa in section [ model ] showing the presence of various couplings existing in the system .",
    "then in section [ sec_stiff ] , we calculate the various response functions of the system for a stiff pump .",
    "in particular , we study the response of the system to noise and demonstrate the proficiency of the amplifier for achieving the quantum limited noise temperature in [ sec_pert_stiff ] .",
    "this is followed by a derivation of the steady state response of the system ( section [ sec_st_stiff ] ) where we show that the system exhibits self - oscillation beyond the bifurcation threshold .",
    "also , we describe the use of the dpa as an efficient squeezer in section [ sec_squ_stiff ] . in the second part of the paper , we present a complete solution of the problem , accounting for the depletion of the pump due to back - action .",
    "we rederive the signal and self - oscillation amplitudes in the presence of back - action in section [ sec_ba ] , using a mean - field approach . in section [ corr_calc ] , we arrive at explicit expressions quantifying the magnitude of back - action in terms of system variables . using the derived value of back - action we plot the corrected values of various response functions of the system .",

    "an important ramification of this effect is that @xmath182 does _ not _ correspond to resonance any longer , as in the case of stiff pump .",

    "this indicates that for some @xmath184 , the system simulates stiff pump behavior and the corresponding @xmath185 corresponds to a _ corrected _ resonance frequency .",

    "( [ deltaeq ] ) for the typical form of dependence ) .",
    "this causes the effective detuning @xmath186 assume a non - zero negative value in the presence of noise .",
    "the above shift also explains the switch between the two branches of the bifurcation loci shown in fig .",

    "the system traces the upper ( thin ) curve showing a decrease in oscillation with drive , till the point it traverses through the minimum where it become unstable and switches to the other branch of high amplitude oscillation ( thin portion of the other curve ) where the resonance condition can be better met .",
    "another important result highlighted by the phase diagram is the necessity of biasing the system near resonance .",
    "a comparison with the curves plotted in fig . [ draw7 ] shows that the system is much more robust to back - action if biased near the relevant frequency ( new @xmath11 corresponding to the shift in @xmath19 ) .",

    "hence the underlying assumptions of perturbative treatment of back - action demands that we restrict ourselves to cases where the system is pumped sufficiently close to plasma frequency of the junction ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "we performed a first - principle analysis of a josephson parametric amplifier involving two rf energy sources and calculated the reciprocal effect of pump amplitude on signal and idler gains in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the analysis was based on a mean field approach of the intrinsic couplings between various components of the frequency spectrum , especially near bifurcation threshold . in particular ,",
    "the effect of back - action on integrated noise power gain and self - oscillation amplitude response of the system were investigated .    starting with the equations derived in section [ model ] , response functions for the dpa",
    "were calculated in section [ sec_stiff ] for a stiff pump .",
    "following analysis in section [ sec_pert_stiff ] showed that the dpa can indeed achieve quantum limited noise temperature .",
    "the dpa also exhibited squeezing with fluctuations in one of the two quadratures squeezed below the quantum limit ( cf .",
    "section [ sec_squ_stiff ] ) .",
    "maximum squeezing was found at the bifurcation threshold for a given pump detuning from resonance , as expected .",
    "then in section [ sec_ba ] , corrections to signal , idler and self - oscillation signal gains were calculated , in the presence of full back - action , yielding our main results as set of coupled equations - ( [ force ] ) , ( [ main14 ] ) and ( [ main16])- involving three inter - dependent response functions of the system @xmath46 , @xmath50 and signal , idler amplitdes .    the significance of the inclusion of back - action is manifested even at the stiff pump level , as seen in section [ sec_st_stiff ] for the calculation of self - oscillation amplitude .",
    "it was shown that the inclusion of back - action to zeroth order ( i.e. back - action due to self - oscillation signal only ) is imperative to get steady state response of the system .",
    "these results are relevant for the amplifier designs based on three - wave mixing with squids as the inherent flux - based coupling mechanism impels a self - consistent treatment of pumps while calculating signal gains .",
    "we believe that the recent experimental results showing a spontaneous emission , reported for a flux - driven josephson parametric amplifier @xcite , can be well explained by doing a similar treatment .",
    "another important feature that emerged out of this restricted analysis , with a stiff pump , was the coincidence of maximum - gain and bifurcation threshold .",
    "this harmony is contingent to symmetric bifurcation boundary obtained for the dpa .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of back - action led us to observe hysteresis in the system , as a function of drive strength .",
    "the magnitude of hysteresis increases as the detuning of the ghost frequency @xmath14 from resonance and effective temperature at the input port of the oscillator are increased .",
    "however , the feature of coincidence of maximum parametric gain and self - oscillation thresholds is preserved ( as in the case of a stiff pump ) .",
    "an important conclusion of our work is the shift of the resonant frequency of the system itself .",
    "this can be clearly deduced from the shift of the phase boundary of the system , which shifts to higher drive strengths and higher resonant frequencies with increase in back - action .",
    "this indicates that adjusting the effective pump frequency @xmath14 near this ` new ' resonance is crucial for making the system less susceptible to back - action induced hysteresis and realize bifurcation at optimal pump strengths .",
    "future experiments with devices employing the bifurcation of josephson junction should take this effect into account .",
    "also , the fact that dpa shows quantum limited behavior in the limit of large gains can be exploited to build a traveling wave amplifier using a cascaded chain of single stage amplifiers , with the effective noise temperature of each stage reduced to at least the cooling chamber of the next stage .    to summarize ,",
