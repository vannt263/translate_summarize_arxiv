    "infrared and optical polarimetry is a suitable tool for observing magnetic fields within molecular clouds at large scales . at these wavelengths polarization",
    "can be produced by dichroic extinction of background starlight .",
    "@xcite proposed that a fraction of non - spherical interstellar dust grains become aligned perpendicular to the local magnetic field due to paramagnetic relaxation .",
    "although this mechanism is commonly invoked in the literature , it seems to be inefficient within molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , a more realistic scenario was proposed by several authors who have successfully modeled the perpendicular alignment between grains and magnetic fields by radiative torques propelled by anisotropic radiation @xcite .",
    "aligned dust grains behave like a polarizer to any incoming radiation , absorbing and scattering the component of the electric field ( @xmath2-vectors ) parallel to their longest axis .",
    "therefore , the observed radiation will carry some degree of linear polarization .",
    "the resulting polarization map outlines the geometry of the magnetic field lines projected onto the plane of sky ( pos ) .",
    "near - infrared ( near - ir ) polarimetric observations trace visual extinctions of a few tens of magnitudes , providing deeper photometry than optical wavelengths .",
    "however , the increase in interstellar extinction is not usually accompanied by a linear increase in the degree of polarization .",
    "this has been interpreted as a decrease in the polarization efficiency , or depolarization , with increasing visual extinction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this depolarization at optical wavelengths is not observed in the pipe nebula @xcite and submillimeter polarization observations show that there is unequivocal evidence that grains do align in dense environments with high visual extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the scattering of stellar light by dust grains also generates linear polarization in the optical and near - ir .",
    "this type of polarization is found in reflection nebulae associated with disks and envelopes of young stars .",
    "ngc 1333 is the most active star - forming site in the perseus molecular cloud @xcite . a large portion of the ngc  1333 young stellar cluster is composed by low - mass stars younger than 1 myr @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are numerous embedded protostars powering molecular and herbig - haro outflows @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that the molecular cloud in ngc 1333 is being disturbed by the large amount of outflow @xcite .    the first polarimetric observations toward ngc1333 were carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted @xmath3-band polarimetric observations towards the center of the ngc 1333 reflection nebula . a larger polarimetric survey covering the full perseus complex",
    "was carried out by @xcite .",
    "these observations show that there is a bimodal distribution of polarization p.a . , indicating that there are two large scale magnetic field components along the line of sight .",
    "ngc1333 iras4a ( hereafter iras4a ) , a low - mass protostellar system , has become the textbook case of a collapsing magnetized core : high angular submm polarimetric observations have revealed that the magnetic field has an hourglass morphology at scales of few hundred aus @xcite .",
    "this is the magnetic field morphology predicted by theoretical models based on magnetically controlled molecular core collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the synthetic polarization maps constructed using models of collapsing magnetized cores @xcite reproduced quite well the observations in iras  4a @xcite . in this context , it is worth mentioning that it is still a question of ongoing debate whether magnetic fields or interstellar turbulence plays a major role in the dynamical evolution of a molecular cloud ( e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report on one of the first scientific results obtained with the near - ir camera liris ( long - slit intermediate resolution infrared spectrograph : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in its polarimetric mode .",
    "the observations were done using the @xmath0-band filter toward stars located relatively close to iras  4a ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) .",
    "the fields were selected to avoid the most active star - forming portion of the ngc  1333 cloud , so the measured polarized light is mainly due to dichroic absorption . in order to ascertain the quality of the near - ir data , we also provide complementary @xmath1-band linear polarimetry obtained with the observatrio",
    "do pico dos dias toward the same region .",
    "the scientific goal of this work is to compare the magnetic field observed in the iras4a molecular core with the larger scale field associated with the cloud surrounding iras  4a .",
    "@xcite have already done this comparison but using very few distant stars ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) retrieved from the @xcite survey .",
    "the near - infrared observations were carried out in december 2006 and december 2007 at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "the liris camera , attached to the cassegrain focus of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope , is equipped by a hawaii detector of @xmath8 pixels optimized for the 0.8 to @xmath9 m range .",
    "liris is capable of performing polarization observations by using a wedged double wollaston device , wedowo , which is composed by a combination of two wollaston prisms and two wedges ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed description ) .",
    "in this observing mode , the polarized flux is measured simultaneously at four different angles ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "an aperture mask of @xmath14 is used in order to avoid overlapping between the different polarization images .",
    "figure  [ imliris ] shows a typical liris image in polarimetric mode .",
    "the degree of linear polarization can thus be determined from data taken at the same time and with the same observing conditions . in order to achieve accurate sky subtraction ,",
    "a 5-point dither pattern was used .",
    "offsets of about 20@xmath15 were adopted along the horizontal , long mask direction . during the 2006 and 2007 campaigns , we took seven and six exposures , respectively , of 20  s per dither position .",
    "the 5-point dither cycle was repeated several times until completion of the observation .",
    "the total observing time for each field was 2800  s in 2006 and 2400  s in 2007 .",
    "we carried out @xmath0-band polarization observations of ten fields , six of them with the telescope rotator at 0@xmath16 and four with the rotator at 90   ( see table[targets ] ) .",
    "figure [ campos ] indicates the observed fields as black and red rectangles , corresponding to observations with rotator at 0  and 90 , respectively .",
    "we covered the area surveyed by observing with the rotator at 0  and 90 , except for the two upper fields .",
    "this procedure allows us to compare both data sets and , consequently , to achieve higher precision in the estimated polarization parameters .",
    "the optical @xmath1-band linear polarimetry was performed using the 1.6 m telescope of the observatrio do pico dos dias ( lna / mct , brazil ) during observing runs conducted in 2007 and 2008 . a specially adapted ccd camera composed by a half - wave rotating retarder followed by a calcite savart plate and a filter wheel",
    "was attached to the focal plane of the telescope .",
    "the half - wave retarder can be rotated in steps of 225 and one polarization modulation cycle is fully covered after a complete 90@xmath16 rotation .",
    "the birefringence property of the savart plate divides the incoming light beam into two perpendicularly polarized components : the ordinary and the extra - ordinary beams . from the difference in the measured flux for each beam one",
    "estimates the degree of polarization and its orientation in the plane of the sky . for a technical description of this polarimetric unit ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to the work by @xcite .",
    "the obtained optical data is part of an ongoing large scale ( @xmath17 square degree ) survey whose results will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( franco et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the area covered by the optical survey overlaps the portion of the sky observed in near - ir , and in order to make a comparative analysis of the results obtained at both wavelengths , we included the optical results gathered for stars lying in the overlapped area in the discussion .",
    "the near - ir data reduction was performed using the _ lirisdr _ package developed by the liris team in the iraf environment . given the particular geometry of the frames ( see fig.[imliris ] ) , the first procedure was to slice the image into four frames .",
    "each set of frames corresponding to a given polarization stage is processed independently .",
    "the data reduction process comprises sky subtraction , flat - fielding , geometrical distortion correction , and finally co - addition of images after registering .",
    "a second background subtraction was performed upon flat - fielded images in order to avoid the residuals introduced by the vertical gradient due to the reset anomaly effect associated with the hawaii arrays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an approximate astrometric solution was determined based on the image header parameters .",
    "aperture photometry of the field stars in each slice was obtained using the task object detection , available within starlink gaia software .",
    "the aperture radius used was @xmath18 , which corresponds to 3 times the median seeing of the night .",
    "the background was extracted from an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath19 and an outer radius of @xmath20 .",
    "the astrometric solution of each slice was tweaked using the astrometric tools available within the starlink gaia software .",
    "we used the 2mass catalogue to perform the photometric and astrometric calibrations . in our sample",
    ", we reached @xmath0 magnitudes as faint as @xmath2117 .",
    "as a final step , we identified the counterparts of each object in the four slices in order to compute the polarization properties . in some cases , matching of stars observed with rotator at 0and 90   was also necessary since some objects were present in both sets of observations .      using the wedowo , we measured simultaneously four polarization states in each of the strips as ,    @xmath22 &   =   & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{0}\\ , \\mathrm{(i _ * + q _ * ) } \\\\ i_{90}[pa=0 ] & =   & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{90}\\ , \\mathrm{(i _ * - q _ * ) }   \\\\ i_{45}[pa=0 ] & =   & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{45}\\ , \\mathrm{(i _ * + u _ * ) }   \\\\ i_{135}[pa=0 ] & =   & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{135}\\ , \\mathrm{(i _ * - u _ * ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the stokes parameters of the object to be measured , and the factors @xmath26}$ ] represent the transmission for each polarization state . in this case , the normalized stokes parameters can be determined by ,    @xmath27    where the factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 measure the relative transmission of the ordinary and extraordinary rays for each wollaston .",
    "these factors were calibrated using non - polarized standards and resulted in the values @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with an uncertainty of about 0.002 in both cases .",
    "the rotation of the whole instrument by 90  causes the exchange of the optical paths for the orthogonal polarization vectors .",
    "now , the resulting polarization states are given by    @xmath32 & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{0 } ( i _ * - q _ * ) \\\\ i_{90}[pa=90 ] & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{90 } ( i _ * + q _ * ) \\\\ i_{45}[pa=90 ] &   = & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{45 } ( i _ * - u _ * ) \\\\ i_{135}[pa=90 ] & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\ , t_{135 } ( i _ * + u _ * ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this effect can be used in order to get a more accurate estimate of the stokes parameters because the combination of both measurements , pa=0  and 90 , results in the cancelation of the transmission factors and reduces flat - field uncertainties .",
    "the normalized stokes parameters are then computed by    @xmath33/i_{90}[pa=0]}{i_{0}[pa=90]/i_{90}[pa=90 ] } \\\\",

    "in addition , we calculated the errors in @xmath42 using a monte carlo method , which returned values similar to those estimated from error propagation .",
    "the 1@xmath43 uncertainty in @xmath44 was estimated ( _ i _ ) by applying the relation derived by @xcite using standard error propagation , that is , @xmath45 , when @xmath46 ; or ( _ ii _ ) graphically with the aid of the curve proposed by @xcite when @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ shot ] shows the polarization uncertainty as a function of the @xmath0-band magnitude achieved with our liris observations .",
    "the observed distribution suggests that the uncertainties are dominated by photon shot noise , as expected for a sample collected with fixed exposure time .",
    "as expected , the uncertainties decrease when the data taken at 0  and 90  are combined .",
    "there is a natural limit which is due to the uncertainty bias when measuring low levels of polarization .",
    "bias in the degree of linear polarization ( @xmath42 ) comes from the fact that this quantity is defined as a quadratic sum of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which produces a non - zero polarization estimate due to the uncertainties in their measurement ( for a detailed discussion see for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to remove the polarization bias and compute the true polarization , we used the prescription proposed by @xcite for low polarization stars .",
    "the true polarization degree can be approximated by the expressions @xmath48 if @xmath49 , otherwise @xmath50 .",
    "we adopted @xmath51 , which corresponds to the estimator defined by @xcite .",
    "observations of polarized and unpolarized standard stars were taken in order to calibrate the instrumental characteristics of liris in its polarimetric mode .",
    "table  [ sstars ] summarizes the general information for these stars : columns 1 to 8 indicate their name , equatorial coordinates , type , polarization degree and position angle , the filter used for the polarization measurements and the reference , respectively .",
    "unpolarized standard stars were observed to check for any possible instrumental polarization and for systematic errors in our polarimetry .",
    "the unpolarized stars g191b2b and bd+28d4211 were observed with rotator at 0and 90 .",
    "the polarized intensity measured for the two unpolarized standards was very small ( see table [ unpol ] ) : the measured normalized stokes @xmath34 and @xmath35 were 0.051% and 0.226% , respectively , with the rotator at 0 , and @xmath52% and 0.119% , respectively , with the rotator at 90 .",
    "table  [ unpol ] shows the observed polarization degree before and after bias correction for the two unpolarized standards .",
    "the measurements taken in the two epochs for bd+28d4211 give consistent values . we applied the method proposed by @xcite for a 99% confidence level for the observed unpolarized standards .",
    "this resulted in a small , if any , instrumental polarization .",
    "the polarized standard star cma r1 no . 24 was observed in order to verify the zero point of the polarization position angles .",
    "table [ tab : pol ] summarizes the results obtained for the four measurements conducted for this object . as expected , high quality data are less sensitive to biasing , and the unbiased polarization has basically the same values of the observed polarization .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties , we see that our @xmath0-band data match the result obtained by @xcite .",
    "the difference between the average p.a .",
    "obtained for these four measurements and that obtained by @xcite is @xmath53 , which is very close to the statistical deviation of our measurements thus discarding any further correction for the zero angle calibration .",
    "table [ tab : irdata ] contains a summary of our near - ir and optical polarization data for stars with a signal - to - noise in the polarization intensity higher than unity .",
    "column 1 gives the star s identification number in our catalogue .",
    "columns 2 and 3 show the equatorial coordinates .",
    "column 4 gives the @xmath0-band magnitude .",
    "columns 5 to 12 show the polarization degree and the polarization p.a . ( with their uncertainties ) for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "the last two columns indicate the rotator position used to acquire the near - ir data , and the object type , respectively .",
    "figure  [ histpa ] shows that , excluding star 13 , the polarization p.a .",
    "distribution measured in the @xmath0-band is quite narrow with a mean position angle of 160  and a standard deviation of only 12@xmath16 .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-band polarization uncertainties may be overestimated .",
    "first , the aforementioned standard deviation is about half the mean 1-@xmath43 uncertainty of the polarization p.a . , and second",
    ", there is a very good agreement between the near - ir and optical data ( see next section ) .",
    "figure[irpolmap ] shows the spatial distribution of the near - ir polarization vectors overlaid on the 2mass @xmath0-band image .",
    "the polarized stars with a declination below @xmath54 have larger polarization degrees than those above this value .",
    "this subsample comprises most of stars with mean p.a . @xmath55",
    "star number 13 is the only object in our catalogue presenting intrinsic polarization ( see section [ pol_ysofor ] ) .",
    "previous optical polarimetric observations performed toward the field of view shown in fig .  [ irpolmap ] detected only two polarized stars of the @xmath0-band sample , stars number 2 and 13 @xcite , and our data are in good agreement with them .",
    "the @xmath1-band polarimetric sample has 12 stars in common with our near - ir data .",
    "figure [ mapavis_ir ] shows the polarization vectors in both bands plotted over a dss image .",
    "there is noticeably good agreement between the two polarization data sets ( see also fig .",
    "[ pacomp ] ) .",
    "thus , the mean value of the p.a .",
    "difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath0-band for the 12 stars is 65 .",
    "figure[sed_plot ] represents the resulting p@xmath56 vs. p@xmath57 diagram for the 12 stars with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarimetric measurements .",
    "the wavelength at which the polarization is highest , @xmath58 , is related to the mean size of the interstellar grains responsible for producing the observed polarized light @xcite .",
    "the typical value of @xmath58 observed for the diffuse interstellar medium is 0.55  @xmath59 m @xcite .",
    "however , in molecular clouds @xmath58 appears to change with the visual extinction @xcite . in the case of ngc 1333",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath58 changes between 0.66 and 0.89  @xmath59 m @xcite .",
    "the two solid lines in fig .",
    "[ sed_plot ] show the expected relation for @xmath60 and 0.86  @xmath59 m .",
    "the data do not show any preferential regime of maximum polarization due to the low statistics .",
    "polarization observations over a wider range of wavelengths are necessary to refine this characterization .",
    "our near - ir and optical maps are characterized by a uniform component predominant to the south of the iras 4a/4b double system ( see fig .  [ mapavis_ir ] ) .",
    "however , north of iras 4a/4b the few detected polarized stars have a broader angle distribution",
    ". most of these stars are likely young stellar objects ( ysos ) . in these cases ,",
    "the polarization is produced by intrinsic scattering within circumstellar disks rather than by interstellar absorption .",
    "several authors have studied the physical properties of ysos by means of polarimetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , in general , observations suggest that near - ir polarization vectors , when produced by single scattering , are oriented perpendicularly to optically thin disks , while multiple scattering within optically thick disks generates polarization vectors whose p.a",
    ". are parallel to their long axis @xcite .",
    "the ysos possibly showing intrinsic polarization in the near - ir and/or @xmath1-band are listed below :    * lkh@xmath61 271 ( star n. 13 of table [ tab : irdata ] ) is a classical t tauri star @xcite .",
    "the near - ir polarization angle and degree are in excellent agreement with the @xmath1-band data .",
    "previous observations showed that the polarization varies considerably , which has being interpreted as arising from outbursts or inhomogeneities in a circumstellar shell within an optically thick circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "* svs 13a ( star n. 24 ) was observed only in the @xmath1-band .",
    "the obtained polarization is in excellent agreement with the value previously measured in the @xmath3-band ( @xmath62 = 7.2 @xmath63 0.9% and p.a .",

    "this object is a well - studied source @xcite which powers a bipolar and collimated outflow associated with the well - known herbig - haro objects hh 7 - 11 @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the outflow is roughly perpendicular to the polarization p.a . , which suggests that the disk is optically thick .",
    "* 2mass j03290289 + 3116010 ( star n. 23 ) is close to svs13a and has a very low degree of polarization . according to the simbad astronomical database ,",
    "this is a bright ( @xmath64 ) k - type star and it is possibly a foreground star .",
    "in fact , previous spectral analysis and photometric studies place this star at a distance of only @xmath2150 pc from the sun @xcite .",
    "* asr 8 ( star n. 25 ) is classified as a brown dwarf by simbad .",
    "however , an extensive survey on the evolutionary state of stars in ngc 1333 identifies this object as a t tauri star with a mass of 0.7m@xmath65 @xcite , which is reinforced by the presence of x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "we therefore attribute the optical polarization measured for this star due to intrinsic scattering .",
    "in addition , there are two bright infrared stars ( @xmath66 ) with low polarization ( stars n.  28 and 34 in table[tab : irdata ] ) that are apparently not associated with ysos , as no star formation or nebulosity signs has been reported in the literature .",
    "their 2mass color indices suggest that they may be unreddened m - type dwarf stars , which is also corroborated by the low degree of polarization .",
    "we therefore consider these objects to be foreground stars .",
    "the most detailed picture of the distribution of gas and dust in the perseus cloud has been provided by the complete project @xcite , a survey of near / far - infrared extinction data , and of atomic , molecular , and thermal dust continuum emission obtained over a large area .",
    "these data show a wide range of visual magnitudes for ngc 1333 , and a non - gaussian co spectral profile consistent with multi - velocity components .",
    "these results are consistent and likely related to a layered cloud structure along the line of sight , which was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "interstellar extinction studies of field stars toward ngc 1333 also suggest at least two components in the line of sight at different distances toward ngc  1333 @xcite .    according to column density maps of the perseus cloud @xcite , the region studied here lies in the lower density envelope of ngc 1333 .",
    "maps of high density molecular tracers ( n@xmath67h@xmath68 , hco@xmath68 ) as well as of the 870  @xmath59 m dust emission , show that around iras  4a the dense gas has a filamentary distribution oriented in the nw  se direction , with the long axis positioned at @xmath55142@xcite .",
    "the near - ir and optical polarization vectors of the background stars shown in fig .",
    "[ mapavis_ir ] trace the pos component of the magnetic field associated with the lower density envelope around iras  4a/4b .",
    "south of these sources , where we have most of the polarization sample , the magnetic field has a direction of @xmath69 .",
    "the observed configuration is consistent with the results obtained at much larger scale by @xcite and @xcite . according to the complete survey @xcite",
    "the polarization was measured toward regions with a visual extinction of 4 to 5 mag .",
    "the magnetic field orientation derived from our data is roughly parallel to the dense filamentary structure associated with iras  4a @xcite .",
    "however , the submm polarization maps towards iras  4a and iras  4b show that the magnetic field within the filament is approximately perpendicular to the filament s major axis @xcite , and is therefore perpendicular to the magnetic field direction traced by our optical and near - ir data . the single - dish submm polarization map from @xcite around iras  4a",
    "is associated with visual extinctions as low as @xmath2110 magnitudes , which is a typical value for near - ir extinction data .",
    "therefore , the submm and near - ir / optical data seem to reveal substantial changes in the magnetic field topology between the dense filament and the diffuse molecular envelope that surrounds it .",
    "such a sharp twist in the field is hard to explain by means of structural changes in the magnetic field only , because within the observed field , the position angle of the optical and near - ir polarimetric data is quite uniform ( see fig.[histpa ] ) .",
    "instead , the two data sets may be simply tracing distinct gas components . as explained in",
    "  [ gasdust ] , there is observational evidence of a multi - component structure for the ngc 1333 molecular cloud .",
    "figure  [ cocomplete ] shows the @xmath70co and @xmath71co spectra extracted from a box containing the region studied here .",
    "these spectra show at least three distinguishable velocity components : a faint emission centered at @xmath72  km  s@xmath73  ( seen more clearly in the @xmath70co data ) , the peak of the @xmath71co data centered at @xmath217.6  km  s@xmath73  and the peak of the @xmath70co data at @xmath216.7  km  s@xmath73 .",
    "this last component has the same @xmath74 of the iras 4a dense core @xcite .",
    "therefore , whereas the submm polarization measurements trace only the molecular cloud component associated with the iras 4a dense core , the near - ir and optical polarimetric data are probably tracing the mean magnetic field of the different velocity molecular cloud components observed in the co maps .",
    "nevertheless , further observations are needed in order to obtain a more complete description of the magnetic field in this region .",
    "we have carried out one of the first polarimetric observations in the @xmath0-band collected with the wht / liris infrared camera .",
    "we also present @xmath1-band linear polarimetry obtained at the observatrio do pico dos dias .",
    "we observed an area of @xmath216@xmath75 around the ngc1333 iras  4a/4b protostellar system .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are :    * the infrared polarization map derived for the surveyed area is highly consistent with the optical map obtained with a different telescope and observational technique .",
    "therefore , the near - ir polarimetric capabilities of liris have proved to be scientifically trustworthy for the astronomical community , and assure this mode will be useful for gathering measurements of objects experiencing high interstellar extinction inaccessible to optical instruments . *",
    "the polarization map obtained for the surveyed area is dominated by a well - ordered component produced by dichroic interstellar absorption . however , there are objects , some of them catalogued as ysos , that show a transversal component which may be generated by internal scattering within circumstellar disks . *",
    "the magnetic field morphology traced by the near - ir / optical map is almost perpendicular with respect to the field morphology obtained with the submillimeter data toward the dense molecular core around iras4a/4b .",
    "the near - ir / optical polarimetric data trace the field morphology of the diffuse molecular gas , which is known to have a multi - velocity structure .",
    "that is , the observed resulting magnetic field direction is probably the averaged magnetic field over several distinct velocity components of the cloud .",

    "<S> the distribution of polarization position angles has low dispersion and suggests the existence of an ordered magnetic field component at physical scales larger than the protostar . </S>",

    "<S> the estimated mean orientation of the interstellar magnetic field as derived from these data is almost perpendicular to the main direction of the magnetic field associated with the dense molecular envelope around iras4a . </S>",
    "<S> since the distribution of the co emission in ngc 1333 indicates that the diffuse molecular gas has a multi - layered structure , we suggest that the observed polarization position angles are caused by the superposed projection along the line of sight of different magnetic field components . </S>"
