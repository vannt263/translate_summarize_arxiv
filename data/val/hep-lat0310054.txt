    "the spacetime lattice is a regularization technique for quantum field theories .",
    "interest in the lattice regularization of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) has arisen in a number of different contexts .      to account for the effects of nonzero lattice spacing , @xmath0 , in lattice qcd simulations ,",
    "work has been done to include explicit @xmath0-dependences into the effective field theory , chpt .",
    "since @xmath1 in lattice qcd simulations is typically larger than the chiral scale @xmath2 gev , it is common to include these @xmath0-dependences by adding extra `` irrelevant '' operators to chpt @xcite .",
    "calculations are then performed in the continuum , using dimensional regularization or some other continuum regularization method , and results contain both @xmath0-dependent terms and @xmath3-dependent terms where @xmath3 is the regularization scale . as usual",
    ", physical observables will be independent of @xmath3 in a regime where chpt is applicable and has acceptable convergence properties .",
    "alternatively , one might prefer to define lattice chpt as an effective theory that exists directly in the same discrete spacetime where lattice qcd resides@xcite . with this approach",
    "the lattice itself regulates the theory , playing the roles that were assigned to both @xmath3 and @xmath0 in the continuum method discussed above .",
    "this type of lattice chpt has no divergences for nonzero @xmath0 and it has no need for a continuum regulator . with small lattice spacings , i.e.  @xmath4 , physical observables will be essentially independent of the regularization scheme and scale , so the results will reproduce those obtainable from the continuum theory of the previous paragraph ( up to negligible differences that vanish exactly as @xmath5 ) .",
    "on coarse lattices , perhaps @xmath6 , it is important to determine whether the scheme dependence really is acceptably negligible before relying on a particular regularization scheme .",
    "explicit lattice chpt studies of physical observables over a range of lattice spacings can help to quantify how small the lattice spacing must be to ensure that this type of scheme dependence is indeed negligible .",
    "lattice regularized chpt is also of interest independently of its connection to lattice qcd .",
    "there has recently been renewed interest in cut - off type regularization schemes for chpt@xcite , and in this context lattice regularized chpt might be viewed as yet another way to implement a cut - off .",
    "@xcite contains some studies of the convergence of chpt by using a particular momentum cut - off scheme , referred to as long - distance regularization , and studying the cut - off dependences order by order in the chiral expansion .",
    "although each observable needs to be essentially independent of regularization scheme , the convergence of chpt is typically defined in a scheme - dependent fashion by comparing the relative sizes of the contributions to some observable at each chiral order .",
    "like most regularization schemes ( but unlike dimensional regularization ) cut - off schemes have power divergent loop integrals , and variation of the cut - off can significantly change the size of loop contributions relative to counterterms .",
    "such studies provide insight into the convergence of chpt and into the effect of having to truncate chpt at some fixed chiral order .",
    "the adelaide group has discussed scheme dependence and convergence for a collection of `` finite range regulators''@xcite , similar to the long - distance regularization scheme mentioned above , and they have made extensive studies of their method in the context of practical extrapolations for lattice qcd data .",
    "lattice regularized chpt is also a method for invoking a cut - off , with its own specific features .",
    "a potential disadvantage of the lattice method is that the continuous rotational symmetry is reduced to a hypercubic rotational symmetry , though this only becomes significant at the very short distance scale set by the lattice spacing .",
    "an advantage of the lattice method is that the lattice spacing appears directly in the lagrangian , in contrast to schemes where the cut - off is inserted by hand into each loop integration .",
    "therefore every calculation with the lattice method automatically preserves all of the lagrangian s symmetries ( like chiral symmetry and gauge invariance ) whereas the users of other cut - off methods must be careful to ensure that implementation of the cut - off preserves the desired symmetries during the calculation of each loop integral .",
    "a particularly valuable feature of lattice regularization is that it does not rely on perturbation theory .",
    "lattice qcd takes advantage of this , and a multi - nucleon effective field theory might also find lattice regularization to be a useful tool.@xcite in the present work , we will restrict ourselves to chpt in the presence of at most a single baryon .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath7 gev . in euclidean spacetime ,",
    "the familiar chiral lagrangian@xcite for pseudoscalar mesons is @xmath8 where the fields are @xmath9 , \\\\",

    "( [ gllagrangian1]-[gllagrangian2 ] ) is not the most general one that could be written on a hypercubic lattice ; it is merely one example of a chpt lagrangian that has the correct continuum limit .",
    "similarly , there is an entire family of lattice qcd lagrangians that approach the unique continuum qcd as @xmath5 .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , extra irrelevant operators that contain explicit powers of @xmath0 can be added to the chpt lagrangian of eqs .",
    "( [ gllagrangian1]-[gllagrangian2 ] ) and a particular choice for the set of associated coefficients would correspond to a particular choice for the underlying lattice qcd lagrangian .",

    "in fact , aoki has shown that the unique continuum wzw action can be derived from the _ lattice _",
    "wilson action.@xcite    alternatively , one might be interested in defining a lattice effective action that resides in the same discrete spacetime where the underlying fermion action ( wilson , for example ) resides . however , a unique lattice wzw effective action can not be derived from the wilson fermion action . here",

    ", we have noted that the known wess - zumino - witten continuum coefficient , @xmath92 , can be derived from the underlying lattice fermion action@xcite but must then be retained by hand in lattice chpt , since a derivation that avoids the continuum step was found to be intractable .    as @xmath5 ,",
    "chpt observables are independent of the regularization scheme and therefore the continuum limit of a lattice regularized calculation is identical to the dimensional regularized result .",
    "a determination of the differences between calculations at @xmath93 and @xmath43 allows for a discussion of the scheme dependence that does arise in practice , due to the truncation of chpt at some specific chiral order .",
    "the lattice spacing is easily adjusted in lattice chpt and the @xmath0-dependences are thus obtained directly .",
    "explicit verifications of scheme - independence , and conversely the opportunity to discover any unacceptably large scheme dependences that might exist in some particular situation , add confidence to the practical use of chpt as an effective field theory .",
