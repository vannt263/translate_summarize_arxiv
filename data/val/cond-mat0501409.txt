    "propagation of electro - magnetic waves in dielectric materials has received extensive attention in recent years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the existence of photonic band gaps ( pbg ) in the transmission spectra of such materials is of particular interest and is of importance in both fundamental science and technological applications .",
    "these studies constitute principal part of mesoscopic physics , a major focus being the possibility of localization of light @xcite , a direct evidence of which has already been reported for a strongly scattering media of semiconductor powders @xcite .",
    "the localization of classical waves is purely a result of multiple scattering in a random environment and free from the complications arising from interaction effects .",
    "though , due to rayleigh scattering , it is more difficult to localize classical waves compared to electrons . .2 in an alternative to the usual pbg systems may be obtained by forming network with slender waveguide tubes .",
    "this geometry does not need materials with high dielectric constants and yet , is capable of demonstrating anderson localization of light .",
    "zhang et al @xcite have experimentally observed anderson localization of light in a three dimensional network consisting of nearly one dimensional segments of waveguide .",
    "vesseur et al @xcite have examined the photonic band structure of a comb - like waveguide geometry .",
    "this work provides an example of a one dimensional photonic crystal enabling one to investigate the occurrence of localized states in such systems .",
    "the network system can produce large gaps even in one dimension , though it may be sensitive to the structure of the unit cell .",
    "recently , network models using serial loop structure have been studied in the context of propagation of electro - magnetic and acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "such theoretical investigations are additional justified as the present day nano - technology produce tailor - made waveguide networks with different geometries .",
    ".2 in photonic band gaps also exist in the network systems without periodicity , such as fractal networks @xcite . due to their self - similar structures and the absence of translational invariance within the structures , fractals @xcite",
    "are much more complicated to study compared to the periodic systems .",
    "investigation of the propagation of classical waves in a network model designed following a fractal geometry offers an interesting opportunity to observe the interplay of deterministic but non - translational order and interference effects . unfortunately , this aspect has been grossly overlooked in the literature except for the recent work done by li et al @xcite , on a sierpinski gasket network .",
    ".2 in in the present work , we propose a model waveguide network based on the geometry of a vicsek fractal @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we study the transmission of electromagnetic waves through finite sized vicsek waveguide network ( vwn ) using real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) and transfer matrix ( tm ) methods .",
    "a regular vicsek fractal is already known to possess exotic spectral properties @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to this , it has also been seen shown that an infinite vicsek fractal can support a countable infinity of extended wavefunction in the context of electronic transport @xcite . some of these states are ` anomalous ' in the sense that the behaviour of the rsrg flow of the parameters of the system and the electronic transport are incompatible to each other @xcite .",
    "this acts as an additional motivation for our work .",
    "we wish to examine the appearence of photonic gaps in such a network system , the dependence of the gaps on the system size and the possible occurence of extended electromagnetic modes in such a deterministic fractal network",
    ". .2 in we find interesting spectal behaviour and formation of photonic gaps in a vwn .",
    "additionally , we have been able to discern a number of eigenmodes in a vwn , some of which display a completely extended nature . for this latter set of states ,",
    "the rsrg flow of the parameters gives a signature of extendedness , while the end - to - end light transmission decays following a power law as a function of the size of the network .",
    "this , to our mind , may lead to a possible power law trapping of light from an experimental point of view .",
    "we present out results below .",
    "a ` unit cell ' of a simple vicsek geometry is obtained by considering a ` cross ' with four dangling ends @xcite joined at a node , as a building unit .",
    "the next generation fractal is obtained by placing four such ` crosses ' around a central cross and so on @xcite .",
    "a vwn may be constructed by considering each arm of a ` unit ' cross to be consisting of a one dimensional waveguide segment .",
    "the dangling edges cause problems in realizing the boundary conditions from the standpoint of experiments .",
    "so , we attach loops of the same waveguide material at each end of a dangling arm .",
    "the first and the second generation vwn thus resemble what have been illustrated in fig .",
    "each arm of a loop is of length @xmath0 .",
    "the other segments are of lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    ".2 in    following zhang and sheng @xcite the ` wave - function ' @xmath3 within any segment of length @xmath4 between the nodes @xmath5 and @xmath6 is given by , @xmath7}{\\sin kl_{i , i+1}}+ \\psi_{i+1}\\frac{\\sin kx}{\\sin kl_{i , i+1}}\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath8 is the amplitude at the @xmath5th node , and @xmath9 is the absolute value of the wave vector in the loop . for an electromagnetic wave , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the frequency and the speed ( in vacuum ) of the electromagnetic wave respectively .",
    "@xmath13 is the relative permittivity of the dielectric medium , which we may assume to be real .",
    "a complex dielectric constant can easily be dealt with .",
    "the continuity of the wave function at the nodes and the flux conservation criterion are used to map the problem of wave propagation in such loops into an equivalent tight binding problem of electron propagation on a one dimension lattice @xcite.the resulting difference equation is , @xmath14 here , we parametrize @xmath15 and , define an effective on - site potential @xmath16 and the effective nearest neighbour ` hopping integral ' is given by , @xmath17 where , @xmath18 is the number of segments between the nodes @xmath5 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the corresponding phase acquired in the @xmath21th segment .",
    "the problem of wave propagation now becomes mathematically equivalent to the problem of transmission of an electron with energy @xmath22 through the mapped lattice , where , @xmath23 .",
    ".2 in it is now simple to eliminate the amplitudes @xmath8 corresponding to the nodes denoted by the patterned circle in [ fig . [ fig1](b ) ] in terms of the amplitudes at the remaining sites .",
    "the result is a vicsek lattice of points [ fig . [ fig2](a ) ] . in the equivalent language of the electronic problem",
    ", we now have three distinct values for the on - site potentials , given by , @xmath24 and , the three nearest neighbour ` hopping integrals ' are given by : @xmath25 where , @xmath26 is the n.n . hopping integral between two neighbouring clusters . here ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the lengths of the loop , the wire and the connector connecting the two neighbouring clusters respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "this reconstruction facilates the use of rsrg to discern the extended and other modes of the lattice as well as to compute the transmittivity .",
    "the results are now discussed .",
    "let us consider a vwn at any arbitrary generation ( converted into a vicsek lattice , of points ) clamped between two semi - infinite waveguide leads .",
    "such a construction in its second generation is shown in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "now , a vwn at any generation @xmath30 can be renormalized @xmath31 times to obtain a second generation structure by decimating the appropriate vertices @xcite .",
    "the rsrg recursion relations for the on - site terms and the hopping integrals are given by , @xmath32[e - f_2(n ) ] }   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "t_2(n+1 ) & = & \\frac{t_2(n)t_1 ^ 2(n)t(n)f_1(n)}{[e-\\epsilon_a(n)][e - f_2(n ) ] }   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "t(n+1 ) & = & t(n ) \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath31 denotes the stage of renormalization and @xmath33 ^ 2-t^2(n ) } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f_2(n ) & = & \\epsilon_c(n)+\\frac{2t_2 ^ 2(n)}{e-\\epsilon_b(n)}+t_1 ^ 2(n)f_1(n )   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f_3(n ) & = & \\frac{e-\\epsilon_b(n)}{[e-\\epsilon_b(n)][e-\\epsilon_c(n)]-2t_2 ^ 2(n ) }   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f_4(n ) & = & \\frac{e-\\epsilon_a(n)-t_1 ^ 2(n)f_3(n)}{[e-\\epsilon_a(n ) ] [ e-\\epsilon_a(n)-t_1 ^ 2(n)f_3(n)]-t^2(n ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that @xmath26 remains fixed under rsrg iterations . .2 in it is not difficult now to construct , by inspection , extended wave functions which have non trivial distribution of amplitudes along the x - axis .",
    "the wave vectors for these wavefunctions are obtained by setting @xmath34 as the rsrg process can proceed , in principle indefinitely , one can extract an infinity of different @xmath9-values by solving the equation ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "a couple of such states are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] on a second stage fractal for @xmath35 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath36 in general flows to infinity with the progress of re - normalization .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to choose the amplitudes at the central site of all the basic five - site cells to be zero in order to avoid the divergence of amplitudes at any arbitrary site .",
    "the ` extended ' character of these eigenmodes are usually tested from a study of the flow of the ` hopping integrals ' under successive rsrg steps .",
    ".2 in the recursion relations ( [ eq8 ] ) reveal that if , @xmath37 at any @xmath31th stage of re - normalization , then @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 immediately reach their fixed points i.e. @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for all subsequent stages of renormalization .",
    "this implies that at any scale of length there is a nonzero overlap between the wave - functions at the nearest neighbour sites ( at that scale ) , and that the amplitudes remain finite everywhere in even an infinite lattice .",
    "for example , solving @xmath46 we get @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath40 and @xmath41 remain fixed at nonzero values ( corresponding to their fixed points ) in these two cases .",
    "thus , from an rsrg point of view we expect an extended character of such states . to see whether such states are ` transparent ' in regard of the incoming wave , we have to compute the transmission of an electromagnetic wave incident on a finite vfn through leads connected to the two - ends of the fractal lattice .",
    "to calculate the transmission coefficient we first renormalize the vicsek lattice @xmath31-times using the rsrg decimation method .",
    "the result is a vicsek lattice consisting of five vertices and characterized by the @xmath31-times renormalized values of the ` on - site ' potentials and the ` hopping integrals ' .",
    "the recursion relations are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "this renormalized version [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] is now reduced to a 3-site cluster [ fig . [ fig2](c ) ] and the effective on - site potential of the central site becomes @xmath50    this triatomic ` molecule ' is now clamped between two semi - infinite perfect waveguides , which are represented , following the discretization process outlined in ref @xcite , by a sequence of identical site potentials @xmath51 and nearest neighbour hopping integral @xmath52 the decimation procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for a second generation fractal .",
    "the equations are easily obtained by artificially considering the lead to be consisting of identical materials of length @xmath2 joined end - to - end .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath53 is now given by @xcite , @xmath54 ^ 2 + ( p_{11}+p_{22})^2 \\sin ^2\\theta_3}\\label{eq13}\\ ] ] where , @xmath55 ^ 2[e-\\tilde\\epsilon_c(n)]}{t_1 ^ 2(n)t_0}- \\frac{2[e-\\epsilon_a(n)]}{t_0}\\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_{12 } & = & 1-\\frac{[e-\\epsilon_a(n)][e-\\tilde\\epsilon_c(n)]}{t_1 ^ 2(n ) }   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_{21 } & = & - p_{12 } \\nonumber \\\\ p_{22 } & = & -\\frac{t_0[e-\\tilde\\epsilon_c(n)]}{t_1 ^ 2(n ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      * ( a ) * let us analyze the wavefunction which corresponds to an extendedd state of the lead - vwn - lead system .",
    "for the values of wave vector correspond to the energy @xmath46 , for example , we can use the recursion relations ( [ eq8 ] ) to write explicitly the renormalized values of @xmath36 in the successive generations as , @xmath56 @xmath57 and so on . here",
    "@xmath58 is constant because @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 attain their fixed point values for @xmath59 .",
    "continuing in this way we get , after @xmath31 steps of renormalization , @xmath60 where , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the system size of the lattice at its @xmath31th generation .",
    "therefore , we see that for large values of @xmath31 , i.e. , for large size of the original lattice @xmath63 as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are invariant at each step of renormalization .",
    "so for large @xmath31 , its simple to work out from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) that @xmath64 indicating power law decay as a function of the total number of matrices .",
    "this is incompatible with the invariance of the hopping integrals under rsrg .",
    "the growth of @xmath65 under rsrg implies that an electromagnetic wave travelling through the perfect waveguide leads and entering the fractal structure will experience larger and larger effective ` potentials ' at the centres of the five site clusters . for large enough vwn systems we thus have the possibility of a power law localization of light .",
    ".2 in the existence of the dangling side units consisting of a wire and a loop which themselves form a fractal geometry , causes destructive interference between the waves propagating and reflecting back and forth along these side units . as for all these wave vectors the amplitude of the wave function",
    "is pinned at the value zero at the centerers of five site clusters at different length scale , standing waves are formed along the branches with nodes at the centers of one or the other five site cluster , which should localize the light wave and reduce the transmission .",
    "we call such modes ` unusual ' , and emphasize that these are eigenmodes not for a finite cluster , but for the _ lead - vwn - lead system _ , irrespective of its size .    .2 in * ( b ) * we have also examined the features of the transmission spectrum of finite vwn s of arbitrary size .",
    "the appearance of transmission maxima separated by photonic gaps is a general phenomenon .",
    "the fragmentation in the spectrum increasing with increasing size of the system .",
    "figures ( [ fig4 ] ) and ( [ fig5 ] ) exhibit the main characteristics where , in addition to the variation of @xmath53 against the wave vector , we study the effect of the change of the size of the loops ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "three cases have been explicitly shown with the size of the loop ( @xmath0 ) increasing from a very small value to a value comparable to the lengths of the other waveguide segments ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    ".2 in though in every case , the exact distribution of values of the @xmath66 is sensitive to the individual values of the parameters , still some interesting behaviour is observed in certain cases .",
    "for example , setting @xmath67 and @xmath68 in arbitrary units , the transmission spectrum shows the presence of clusters of high transmittivity flanked by sharp delta - like peaks , even for a first generation vwn [ dashed line in fig . [ fig4](a ) ] . the same set of parameters leads to a fragmented band structure as we move over to the second generation [ vertical line in fig . [ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "the spectrum reveals almost similar features as @xmath0 is gradually increased from @xmath69 to higher values . for @xmath70",
    ", we get a clear signature of wider photonic gaps separating four clusters of high transmittivity .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , where the dashed and the solid lines again correspond to the first and second stage vwn .",
    ".2 in when the dimension of the loop starts getting larger than the connecting waveguide segments , we find that new clusters of transmission maxima start appearing in the major photonic gaps of the earlier generation [ fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ] .",
    "the three major photonic gaps corresponding to the first generation fractal get populated by two major photonic bands ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) when the length of the loop exceeds the other two segments @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    ".2 in to make the appearance of the photonic gaps more pronounced , in fig . [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the variation of transmission coefficient @xmath53 of a vwn in the first ( dashed curve ) and the second ( solid vertical lines ) respectively .",
    "the more or less fixed zones of zero transmission around @xmath71 and @xmath72 mark the broad photonic band gaps in a vwn .",
    "we have shown that light transmission in a vicsek fractal geometry is marked by the appearance of unusual extended - like eigenmodes for which a non - trivial distribution of finite amplitudes can be obtained in a vicsek waveguide network clamped between semi - infinite leads .",
    "the transmittivity of such a lead - network -lead system shows a power law decay as the network grows bigger .",
    "broad photonic gaps are obtained by appropriately choosing the network parameters .",
