    "since its invention @xcite , the double layer polarization theory of charged colloidal suspension is well known for its complexity . in the theory , the dielectric function",
    "is calculated by analysing the out of phase ( charging ) electric current at finite frequencies .",
    "this approach makes the theory hard to grasp .",
    "although equivalent , the out of phase current is not as close to the intuitive thinking as the dipole built up under the applied field . in particular the location of the polarization charge is not obvious from the theory .",
    "some researchers even wrongly assumed that the dominant polarization charge is around the particle when trying to simplify the theory .",
    "another consequence of using current to do calculation is that the static dielectric constant is obtained indirectly , via taking the zero frequency limit of the dynamic ac calculation .",
    "normally one would like to be able to calculate the static dielectric constant statically , because such calculation will be easier to understand than the dynamic one .",
    "however , for many years there is no static calculation which reproduces the known result .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite , grosse and shilov , based on the equilibrium thermodynamic argument , suggested that the zero frequency dielectric constant should be obtained by calculating the free energy stored , as the form of the non - uniform salt concentration around the particles .",
    "for the system of @xmath0 electrolyte , their suggestion reads @xmath1 dv \\label{shilov}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the total volume , @xmath3 is the applied electric field strength .",
    "the static dielectric increment @xmath4 is the static absolute dielectric constant subtracts the contribution from the simple electrolyte solution .",
    "the free energy stored @xmath5 , is calculated by integrating the free energy changes due to the counterion and coion concentration perturbations @xmath6 , @xmath7 outside the double layer , where @xmath8 is the equilibrium ion concentration in the bulk , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the boltzmann constant and the temperature respectively .",
    "in fact , the ions concentrations are the same outside the double layer , therefore the free energy is stored in the form of non - uniform salt concentration distribution .",
    "grosse and shilov have checked that eq.([shilov ] ) is obeyed for the well known solution of the dilute charged sphere suspension .",
    "they further used eq.([shilov ] ) to calculate the static dielectric increment of dilute ellipsoids , which is not easy if the original calculation method is used .    in this work ,",
    "we prove eq.([shilov ] ) ( with some corrections from the double layer region ) based on the electrokinetic equations , so that its general validity is established on the same basis as the double layer polarization theory .",
    "we consider only the simple case where the two ions have the same mobility , but put no restriction on the @xmath11 potential value . by analysing the charging current",
    ", we also show explicitly that the polarization charges are close to the two electrodes .",
    "below , we summarize the thin double layer theory in section ii . the charging electric current density and the dipole",
    "are analysed in section iii .",
    "eq.([shilov ] ) is derived in section iv .",
    "a short summary concludes the paper .",
    "the standard electrokinetic theory @xcite describes the ion dynamics ( @xmath12 ) by the smoluchowski equations , the electrostatic potential ( @xmath13 ) follows the poisson s equation , and the fluid velocity obeys the navier - stokes equation with an electric body force given by the product of the local charge density and the electric field .    the analysis of the dynamic equation proceeds differently within and outside the double layer ( the bulk ) , where different approximations been appropriate @xcite .",
    "the bulk equations to be used later are summarized in subsection [ bulk ] below ( which apply for the @xmath0 electrolyte with the equal ion mobility ) .",
    "the partial solutions from the two regions are matched smoothly at the boundary of the double layer to give the full solution .    in the case of a thin double layer , where the radius of curvature of the particle is much larger than the double layer thickness , the double layer region can be approximated as a flat double layer . the solution within the flat double layer",
    "is known and the matching conditions act effectively as the boundary conditions for the quantities outside the double layer . in subsection [ bc ] below we summaries the boundary conditions to be used .      it is well known that , in the case of @xmath0 electrolyte with the equal ion mobility , the solution becomes charge neutral a few debye lengths away from any interface @xcite .",
    "the salt perturbation does not carry charge , therefore uncouples with the potential .",
    "the unperturbed salt has a uniform distribution so the flow does not couple with the salt perturbation by convection ( to the first order perturbation ) .",
    "the bulk solution is charge neutral to begin with , so the potential does not produce force to couple with the flow . in the bulk one only needs to solve the laplace equation @xmath14 for the potential , and the simple diffusion equation @xmath15 for the salt perturbation @xmath16 .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath17 is the same for both ions . since the flow velocity couples passively to other quantities ( via the boundary condition at the double layer )",
    ", we do not need to calculate it for analysing the dielectric response .",
    "the conduction current density @xmath18 in the bulk is local and ohmic , obeying @xmath19 the conductivity is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the counterion charge .",
    "note that eq.([ohmic ] ) is justified for the electrolyte with the equal ion mobilities , since the perturbed salt is charge neutral . for systems with different ion mobilities ,",
    "there is also a ( small ) current density controlled by the salt , which is not proportional to the local electric field .",
    "the fact that ions in general have different mobilities complicate the analysis very much ( all three eqs.([phi])([c])([ohmic ] ) will be modified ) .",
    "the correction in the dielectric response @xcite , however , seems perturbative .",
    "we will therefore focus on the simplest system in this work .",
    "define the perturbed surface charge density as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the coordinate in the direction normal to the interface ( which is @xmath24 ) . by analysing the ion conservations within the thin double layer , and assuming that no ion fluxes penetrate into the particles , one obtains the conservation equation for the surface charge density @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the debye length is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dielectric constant of the solvent .",
    "note that @xmath29 is not sensitive to the exact value of the cut off @xmath30 , whose plausible value is between @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "the surface conductances are expressed as the bulk conductance @xmath33 times the relative conductances @xmath34s , to make some formulae neater .    using a similar analysis ,",
    "the perturbed surface excess ion density @xmath35 dr_n$ ] obeys @xmath36 here @xmath37 is also not sensitive to the exact value of the cut off .",
    "the surface conductances @xmath34 have been calculated @xcite , which include the effect of the convection current inside the double layer .",
    "there is also an onsager relation @xmath38 as can be checked in the microscopic expressions @xcite .",
    "there are also other boundary conditions for the flow field , and constitutive equations for @xmath29 , and @xmath37 .",
    "however we will only need eqs.([sigma])([gamma ] ) in this work .",
    "note that in the double layer polarization theory , the slow polarization of the double layer is controlled by the salt diffusion .",
    "therefore the time derivative terms @xmath39 , @xmath40 in eqs.([sigma])([gamma ] ) are often small , hence neglected . in this paper",
    "the time derivatives are kept , so that the interface polarization @xcite ( maxwell - wagner theory ) is included .",
    "in this section , we decompose the total current density into the charging current density , which stores free energy , and the conducting current density , which is dissipative . we also show explicitly that the large dipole comes from the polarization charge close to the electrodes , rather than from the charge close to the particles .      before we decompose the total current density , we first express the averaged current density as did by de lacey and white @xcite .",
    "the final expression has the advantage that it is valid independent of the specific current density constitutive relation close to or within the charge particles .",
    "@xmath41    we define a two - components surface @xmath42 , which is inside the solution and very close to the two electrodes ( see fig .",
    "the surface @xmath42 encloses the total space @xmath2 , which is further partitioned by the surface @xmath43 into @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath43 is a ( multi - components ) mathematical closed surface which includes the charged particles and their double layer ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the space @xmath45 is enclosed by the surface @xmath43 .",
    "the volume @xmath46 is the space between the two surfaces @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "the differential area vector @xmath47 is pointing into @xmath46 for both surfaces @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in the above derivations , the space integral is decomposed into two term .",
    "the integral on @xmath45 is transformed into two term by the identity @xmath48 . to get the third line we have assumed that the current in the volume @xmath46 obeys the ohm s law @xmath49 .",
    "the second term is obtained by the gauss theorem . in deriving the last term ,",
    "we have not assumed any constitutive relation for the current density in @xmath45 .",
    "the only property used inside @xmath45 is the charge conservation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the free charge density . in the fourth line",
    "the integral on @xmath46 is written as @xmath52 . in the last line ,",
    "the relation @xmath53 and the gauss theorem are used .",
    "we also assumed that the ohm s law applies on the surface @xmath43 .",
    "for each instance , we define the conducting current density @xmath54 as the current density of a reference system , which is at a steady state where the averaged electric field is the same as the original system at that time . the charging current density @xmath55 is the difference between the total current density and the conducting current density . given a time evolution of the applied field , for example an adiabatic charging process ,",
    "the conduction current density as defined does not change sign under the time reversal operation . whereas the charging current density changes sign under the time reversal .",
    "the reference system has the fields @xmath56 , @xmath57 which both obey the laplace equations , and the steady state boundary conditions @xmath58    the analysis similar to ( [ bi ] ) on the conducting current @xmath54 gives @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the identity matrix . equation ( [ i0 ] ) has one term less than eq.([bi ] ) because @xmath61 .",
    "define the charging current density as @xmath62 .",
    "noticing that @xmath63 ( by the definition of @xmath56 ) , we subtract eq.([i0 ] ) from eq.([bi ] ) to cancel their first terms to give @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 obey the laplace and diffusion equations respectively .",
    "their boundary conditions read @xmath67    it is the first term @xmath68 in eq.([bdi ] ) which gives the main contribution in the salt polarization theory @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to examine the dipole produced by the charging current density @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 where we have used the identity @xmath48 to get the second line . in the last step , gauss s theorem and the charge conservation equation are used . in the last term",
    ", we can restrict the range of integration to @xmath45 because the charge density @xmath51 vanishes within @xmath46 for the symmetric electrolyte .",
    "the result reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the dipole of the system .",
    "the first term @xmath73 is the dipole increment due to the free charges flow into the electrode surface .",
    "the term @xmath74 is the time derivative of the dipole close to or inside the particles .",
    "compare eq.([bdi ] ) with eq.([p ] ) , we conclude that the large polarization in the double layer polarization theory consists of the dipole built up by the ( free ) ions accumulated at the boundary of the electrodes , rather than the dipole around or within the particles .",
    "we now establish our main goal , the reversible work done at the charging process is due to the free energy stored as the form of the non - uniform salt concentration .",
    "our result also contains the additional contributions within the double layer regions . the charging power is @xcite @xmath75 note that @xmath42 has two components close to the two electrodes .",
    "equation ( [ p ] ) is identical to the charging current times the voltage difference between the two electrodes .",
    "because @xmath76 and both @xmath13 , @xmath56 are constant on each electrodes , the reference potential @xmath56 is the same as the true potential at the electrode surface @xmath42 .",
    "therefore @xmath13 can be replaced by @xmath56 in eq.([p ] ) . in the bulk solution ,",
    "the current is simply given as @xmath77 .",
    "using that @xmath78 within @xmath46 , one integration by parts to get the identity @xmath79 the last term is actually zero because @xmath80 at the electrodes @xmath42 .",
    "use the above identity , we obtain @xmath81    we first rearrange the term @xmath82 so that the driving force of the surface current @xmath83 appears ( see the last two terms of eq.([sigma0 ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath84 in the first term , @xmath85 , and we eliminate @xmath86 by eq.([dsigma ] ) , to get @xmath87 where ( surface ) integration by parts is used twice in the second term .",
    "( note that @xmath43 is a close surface , and has no boundary . )",
    "finally we use eq.([sigma0 ] ) to eliminate @xmath88 in the second term to get @xmath89 the above manipulations lead to @xmath90    the first term can be further transformed by using eqs.([sigma0])([dsigma ] ) to eliminate @xmath91 , @xmath92 respectively , as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is used to cancel terms . in the last step , ( [ gamma0])([dgamma ] )",
    "are used to eliminate @xmath95 , @xmath96 respectively .",
    "we would like to enlarge the integration area of the first two terms to include @xmath42 , so that the surface integral on @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be transformed to the bulk integral on @xmath97 by the green s identity .",
    "the salt concentration @xmath57 contributed from each particle decays as @xmath98 or faster , because the monopole strength vanishes @xmath99 ( we use eq.([gamma0 ] ) , and integration by parts ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath100 decays no slower than @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the integral on the electrode surface @xmath42 scales less than the system size . whereas the original integrals on @xmath43 are extensive , and hence dominant . for a large enough system ( thermodynamic limit )",
    ", we freely enlarge the integration area of the first two terms as @xmath101 with negligible error , to derive @xmath102 where we have used the green s identity , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .    finally , put the above derivations together , and use the onsager relation @xmath38 , we obtain the result @xmath105 where in the last step , we have assumed that the charging rate is very small , to neglect the terms quadratic in the charging rate .    in the linear response regime , the perturbations @xmath37 , @xmath29 , @xmath106 , and @xmath13",
    "are all proportional .",
    "we can integrate eq.([ptot ] ) to obtain @xmath107 equation ( [ e0 ] ) shows that the external electric work done of the charging process is actually saved in the forms of the non - uniform salt concentration in the bulk ( first term ) and inside the double layer ( second term ) , as well as the electric energy stored in the polarized double layer ( last term ) .",
    "the first term is as proposed by grosse and shilov @xcite .",
    "the second term is of the similar physical origin as the first term but its magnitude is much smaller for large particles with thin double layers .",
    "the dynamic calculations @xcite do not have this term because they neglect the ( small ) term @xmath40 in eq.([gamma ] ) so that their static result is less complete as in eq.([e0 ] ) .",
    "the last term accounts for the energy stored in the interface polarization @xcite .",
    "it is not included in the dynamic calculation @xcite because the term @xmath39 in eq.([sigma ] ) has been neglected .",
    "the exact values of @xmath29 and @xmath37 depend on the quantities like the dielectric constant and the conductivity of the particles , but the general forms of the last two terms in eq.([e0 ] ) remain the same .",
    "using the electrokinetic equations , we have shown in eq.([e0 ] ) that the work done on the charging current is stored in ( i ) the free energy of the uneven salt concentration in the bulk solution , ( ii ) the free energy of the double layer excess ion density , and ( iii ) the polarized double layer charge .",
    "we also show in eqs.([bdi])([p ] ) that , the dipole of the free charge close to the electrode surface , gives the dominant dielectric increment of the double layer polarization theory .",
