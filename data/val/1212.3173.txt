    "therefore , the search for independent estimates of cepheid reddening values is still actual , and this is our primary aim .    both bbw techniques  surface brightness ( radius - variation modelling ) and maximum likelihood ( light - curve modelling )  are based on the same astrophysical background but make use somewhat different calibrations ( limb - darkened surface brightness parameter , bolometric correction  effective temperature pair ) on the normal colours . here",
