    "in @xcite , thurston put a complex hyperbolic structure on the space @xmath2 of euclidean metrics on the sphere with fixed cone angles @xmath3 by showing that the area of the metric is a hermitian form with respect to some natural choices of coordinates on the space of metrics .",
    "this provided a more elementary approach to the deligne - mostow examples of non - arithmetic complex coxeter orbifolds .",
    "bavard and ghys @xcite adapted thurston s construction to the planar case by considering the space of convex polygons with fixed angles or , equivalently , with fixed directions of edges . on this space , the area of a polygon turns out to be a real quadratic form ( with respect to the edge lengths ) of the signature @xmath4 .",
    "this turns the space of polygons with fixed edge directions into a hyperbolic polyhedron . by computing",
    "the dihedral angles of this polyhedron , bavard and ghys were able to obtain all hyperbolic coxeter orthoschemes from the list previously drawn by i m hof @xcite .",
    "for more details , see @xcite .",
    "the bavard - ghys polyhedron can be viewed as a subset of thurston s space , since gluing together two copies of a polygon along the boundary yields a euclidean cone - metric on the sphere .    in the present paper",
    ", we are generalizing the construction of bavard and ghys to higher dimensions .",
    "namely , we consider the space of @xmath0-dimensional polyhedra with fixed directions @xmath5 of the facet normals and exhibit a family of quadratic forms that makes it to a hyperbolic cone - manifold @xmath6 with polyhedral boundary .",
    "we also obtain partial information about the cone angles in the interior and dihedral angles on the boundary of @xmath6 .",
    "the study of the space of @xmath0-dimensional polyhedra with fixed facet normals poses some problems that are missing in the case of polygons @xmath7 .",
    "first , the facet normals do nt determine the combinatorial structure of the polyhedron anymore . in order to analyze the space of polyhedra",
    ", we employ machinery from discrete geometry , namely gale diagrams and secondary polyhedra @xcite .",
    "this constitutes section [ sec : shapes ] of our paper .",
    "second , one needs to introduce a quadratic form and show that it has a hyperbolic signature . for @xmath8 one can still take the surface area , but for @xmath9 a new construction is needed .",
    "this is provided by mixed volumes , which yield a whole family of quadratic forms of hyperbolic signature , even for @xmath8 .",
    "the signature of the quadratic form is ensured by the alexandrov - fenchel inequalities .",
    "this aspect is discussed in section [ sec : mixvol ] .",
    "finally , the dihedral angles are now more difficult to compute .",
    "positive and negative results in this direction are contained in section [ sec : hypgeom ] .",
    "all along the paper we are analyzing several examples .",
    "one of them is given by the space of @xmath10-dimensional polyhedra with @xmath11 faces whose normals are parallel to those of a triangular bipyramid , figure [ fig : example ] left .",
    "translating each face independently yields @xmath11 different combinatorial types , and the space of all polyhedra up to similarity forms a @xmath12-dimensional polyhedral complex on figure [ fig : example ] middle .",
    "the surface area is a quadratic form of signature @xmath13 on the space of polyhedra , which puts a hyperbolic metric on the complex making it a right - angled hyperbolic hexagon , figure [ fig : example ] right .      a different generalization ( and dualization ) of the bavard - ghys construction",
    "was given by kapovich and millson @xcite who considered the space of polygonal lines in @xmath14 with fixed edge lengths .",
    "by alexandrov s theorem @xcite , every euclidean metric with cone angles @xmath15 is the intrinsic metric on the boundary of a unique convex polyhedron in @xmath14 .",
    "thus thurston s space is the space of all convex polyhedra with fixed solid exterior angles at the vertices .",
    "a link between our construction and that of thurston is discussed in section [ sec : relwork ] that contains also a number of other connections to discrete and hyperbolic geometry .",
