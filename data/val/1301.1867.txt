    "electromagnetic acoustic transduction is a technique used to generate and detect mechanical waves in magnetoelastic conductors for the purpose of nondestructive testing . the devices , called electromagnetic acoustic transducers ( emats ) or electromagnetic acoustic receivers ( emars ) , function by exploiting the coupling between electromagnetic and mechanical effects in a deformable continuum .",
    "the transducer mechanism ( as shown in the schematic in figure 1 ) consists of a current - carrying coil suspended on the specimen under test which is magnetized by a large static magnetic field .",
    "an ac current is passed through the coil which generates a time - varying magnetic field in the specimen .",
    "this , on interaction with the static magnetic field , leads to an electromagnetic body force that causes the generation of mechanical waves in the specimen . in the case of emars ,",
    "the existing mechanical waves in the specimen , on interaction with the static magnetic field , produce time - varying magnetic field in the vicinity .",
    "this generates an ac current in the current - carrying coil which can be measured to analyze the mechanical waves in the specimen .",
    "thus , it is very important to understand the exact coupling between mechanical and electromagnetic fields for an accurate mathematical modelling of the process .",
    "several orientations of the specimen and the coil for emats have been studied in the recent literature .",
    "much of the work ( including @xcite ) is based , among other literature , on the papers by ludwig et al .",
    "@xcite , ogi @xcite , and thompson @xcite on the theory and numerical simulation of emats .",
    "recently , shapoorabadi et al .",
    "@xcite have presented the governing equations of emats using a formulation involving the magnetic vector potential .",
    "the list of references is by no means exhaustive and there are many more papers and theses on this subject .",
    "however , the existing theory of emats is , in our view , incomplete in some respects .",
    "many theoretical models have been developed and experimental results been obtained for only a sinusoidal steady state of current and displacement ( such as @xcite ) .",
    "a large volume of literature assumes linear elastic deformations in the specimen and a linear coupling between the electromagnetic and mechanical phenomena ( such as @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is , however , not the case in reality with the coupling being nonlinear , as has been presented in the classical texts by pao @xcite , eringen and maugin @xcite , and in the recent paper by maugin @xcite .",
    "moreover , with the development of soft polymeric electro- and magnetoelastic smart materials ( @xcite , @xcite ) in the recent years , one needs to take into account the possibility of finite deformations . in some materials ,",
    "heat generation caused by electric currents may lead to significant changes in magneto - elastic properties , hence these effects also need to be taken into account .    in this paper , we present the equations that govern wave propagation in a finitely deformed solid in the presence of electromagnetic fields . on the existing finite deformation , magnetization , and electric polarization , time dependent small increments in the electric ,",
    "magnetic , temperature , and deformation fields are allowed .",
    "we provide a general constitutive formulation based on a free energy function that depends on the initial deformation , underlying electromagnetic fields , and temperature .",
    "this is based on a generalization of the constitutive formulations of electroelasticity and magnetoelasticity provided by dorfmann and ogden @xcite . the same formulation of magnetoelasticity has been used by destrade and ogden @xcite , and author and co - workers @xcite to study some wave propagation problems in magnetoelasticity .    in section 2 ,",
    "we recapitulate the basic governing equations of electromagnetism in continua and the laws of thermodynamics as given by pao @xcite and eringen and maugin @xcite .",
    "these are used to derive constitutive relations from a free energy function .",
    "we then allow for small time - dependent increments in section 4 to study wave propagation .",
    "several ` moduli ' tensors are also introduced in this section to quantify the couplings in elastic , electric , magnetic , and temperature fields .",
    "it is expected that the general equations provided here will be solved using numerical schemes such as fem for specific boundary problems related to emats .",
    "the undeformed stress - free _ reference configuration _ of a continuous elastic body is denoted by @xmath0 and its boundary by @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 , the _ current configuration _ , be the region occupied by the body at time @xmath3 and @xmath4 its boundary .",
