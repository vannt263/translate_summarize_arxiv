    "lsw experiments search for wisps via the process @xmath1  @xcite . for a photon - counting detection scheme , the signal rate , @xmath2 ,",
    "is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rate of photons fed into the experiment , @xmath5 , @xmath6 the efficiency of the detector and @xmath7 the probability for photon - wisp and wisp - photon conversion , respectively , which are both proportional to the square of the photon - wisp coupling , @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the sensitivity on the coupling , @xmath9 , i.e.  the expected upper limit on @xmath8 for the case that @xmath10 is realized in nature , scales with the detector parameters as @xmath11 with @xmath12 the count - rate sensitivity and @xmath6 the quantum efficiency of the detector .",
    "the count rate sensitivity is typically roughly proportional to the square root of the dark count rate , @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the sensitivity can be improved ( i.e.  lowered ) by decreasing the dark count rate or increasing the quantum efficiency .    to compare different detectors ,",
    "the figure of merit @xmath14 , is used .",
    "thus , larger values of @xmath15 identify better detectors .",
    "the count rate sensitivity is taken to be the average upper limit of unified confidence intervals and is estimated using toy monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "early lsw experiments used pmts for photo - detection  @xcite .",
    "recent lsw experiments used ccds and lasers in the visible spectrum  @xcite .",
    "future lsw experiments will use nir lasers  @xcite because optical elements are known to withstand high powers at these wavelengths . at nir wavelengths ,",
    "silicon based ccds have a much reduced quantum efficiency compared to the visible spectrum .",
    "therefore , other devices for photo - detection are sought .",
    "these detectors should have a quantum efficiency that is similar to the quantum efficiency of ccds in the optical and a dark count rate below that of ccds .",
    "additionally , it is desirable that these detectors can time - resolve single photons ( spd ) . a review of spds is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sections  [ seggern :",
    "sec : ccd ] to [ seggern : sec : pmt ] ( electron - multiplying ) ccds , qi spds from ref .",
    "@xcite and pmts are discussed , respectively , and the figures of merit are calculated .",
    "the results are compared in section  [ seggern : sec : concl ] . to calculate the count rate sensitivity , @xmath12 , a confidence level of @xmath16 is assumed .",
    "ccds are currently the prime choice for scientific visual imaging with a wide range of devices to choose from .",
    "the imaging area of ccds is segmented into columns each consisting of a series of mis capacitors . during data taking",
    ", these capacitors are biased into deep - depletion .",
    "incident photons are absorbed in the semiconductor material and produce free charges which are stored by the capacitors .",
    "these charges are integrated during an exposure . at the end of an exposure ,",
    "the collected charges are transported to a read - out structure and digitized .",
    "hence , a ccd can not resolve single photons .",
    "in addition to the charges generated by incident photons , thermally generated free charges are produced and stored as well .",
    "these constitute the dark counts , which contributes to the overall noise .",
    "the process of read - out and digitization adds a second source of noise .",
    "hence , the total noise is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the read - out noise , @xmath19 the exposure time and @xmath20 the production rate of dark counts .",
    "o0.37     the lsw experiment alps at desy used a commercially available , low noise ccd camera with @xmath21 sized pixels ( pixis ccd )  @xcite .",
    "a dark count rate below @xmath22 was achieved by liquid cooling of the ccd chip and the camera was equipped with low - noise read - out electronics ( @xmath23 )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the read - out noise is the larger contribution to the total noise for exposures shorter than @xmath24 .",
    "if the signal can be focussed to a single pixel , a data set of 20 one hour exposures yields a figure of merit @xmath25 for a quantum efficiency of @xmath26 which is typical in the visible spectrum .",
    "electron multiplying ccds ( emccds ) amplify the charge signal before read - out in an avalanche multiplication register  @xcite .",
    "this allows to neglect the read - out noise and , hence , short exposure times are possible .",
    "but at the same time , the quantum efficiency is effectively reduced by a factor of two due to the additional noise from the multiplication process  @xcite .",
    "the original quantum efficiency , i.e.  without charge multiplication in an avalanche register , can be recovered by interpreting the read - out values in a binary fashion , i.e.  photon detected yes / no  @xcite , where a photon is counted if the digitized signal is above a threshold , @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the analysis can be reduced to that of a counting experiment .",
    "if contamination by noise and loss of signal due to the threshold can be neglected , this yields @xmath28 assuming the same values as above ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of data ) .    for nir wavelengths ,",
    "the pixis ccd was found to have a reduced quantum efficiency of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the figure of merit is reduced accordingly for the pixis ccd ( @xmath33 ) and emccd ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "ingaas based ccds exist , which have a much smaller band gap than silicon and , therefore , a much higher quantum efficiency ( @xmath35 ) than the silicon - based pixis ccd .",
    "but these devices also have a dark count rate , which is six orders of magnitude above that of the pixis ccd  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these specialized ccds are of no help when improving the detector part of lsw experiments .",
    "to maintain a low dark count rate and achieve a high quantum efficiency at nir wavelengths at the same time , sensors operated at cryogenic temperatures can be used .",
    "most of the devices listed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cryogenic or not ) have however dark count rates much above that of the pixis ccd",
    ". only transition edge sensors ( tes ) were found to have low dark count rates below that of the pixis ccd  @xcite .",
    "tes are bolometric sensors which are operated at @xmath36 . combined with a proper coating",
    ", high quantum efficiencies of @xmath16 can be reached  @xcite .",
    "the dark count rate and quantum efficiency expected for alps - ii ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) are assumed here as benchmark parameters  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding figure of merit for 20 hours of data is @xmath39 .",
    "the sensitive area of tes detectors and the pixels of a ccd are both of order @xmath40 .",
    "if the signal can not be focussed on such a small area , the pixels of a ccd can be binned .",
    "but , as discussed above , the integrated dark count rate increases at the same rate as the area of interest . accordingly , the figure of merit and the sensitivity on the coupling may worsen significantly . in this case ,",
    "pmts are a very good alternative although they have a limited quantum efficiency ( @xmath41 ) and a limited spectral range ( @xmath42 )  @xcite .",
    "the sensitive area of a    o0pt    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     pmt consists of a photo - sensitive material with a low work function .",
    "incident photons produce free electrons which are directed to an electron multiplier by a focussing electrode .",
    "the high gain of the electron multiplier allows single photon detection . cooling the sensitive area reduces the dark count rate .",
    "for example , the ships helioscope uses a pmt with an active area of @xmath43 , which has a peak quantum efficiency of @xmath44 and a dark count rate of @xmath45 when cooled to @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "surprisingly , of all spds used in qi experiments , only tes detectors have a sufficiently low dark count rate to improve significantly over conventional ccds",
    ". the figures of merit of the detectors mentioned in the above sections are summarized in tab .",
    "[ seggern : tab : comparison ] . of the presented alternatives ,",
    "a tes is the best option . especially in the nir ,",
    "a tes is superior to a ccd because its quantum efficiency does not deteriorate for these wavelengths . in the visible regime ,",
    "ccds remain a viable option when only few resources are available for detector development . from the values listed in tab .",
    "[ seggern : tab : comparison ] , it seems that pmts are the worst option .",
    "their figure of merit is two orders of magnitude below that of ccds ( visible ) , which is caused mainly by their high dark count rate .",
    "however , considering their large sensitive area , pmts are the detector of choice if the signal can not be focussed very well .",
    "these findings are schematically summarized in fig .",
