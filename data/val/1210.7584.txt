    "the heavy ion collisions produce matter at extreme temperatures and densities where it is expected to be in the form of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a phase in which the quarks and gluons can move far beyond the size of a nucleon making color degrees of freedom dominant in the medium .",
    "the experimental effort to produce such matter started with low energy cern accelerator sps and evolved through voluminous results from heavy ion collision at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "the recent results from large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments @xcite are pointing towards formation of high temperature system in many ways similar to the matter produced at rhic .",
    "one of the most important signal of qgp is the suppression of quarkonium states @xcite , both of the charmonium ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc ) and the bottomonium ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc ) families .",
    "this is thought to be a direct effect of deconfinement , when the binding potential between the constituents of a quarkonium state , a heavy quark and its antiquark , is screened by the colour charges of the surrounding light quarks and gluons .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments have carried out detailed quarkonia measurements in pbpb collisions with the higher energy and luminosity available at the lhc .",
    "the atlas measurements @xcite show suppression of inclusive @xmath2 with high transverse momenta @xmath8 in central pbpb collisions compared to peripheral collisions at @xmath9 tev .",
    "similarly , cms measured a steady and smooth decrease of suppression of prompt @xmath2 as a function of centrality with nuclear modification factor @xmath10 remaining @xmath11 1 even in the peripheral bin @xcite .",
    "the melting temperature of the quarkonia states depends on their binding energy .",
    "the ground states , @xmath2 and @xmath5 are expected to dissolve at significantly higher temperatures than the more loosely bound excited states .",
    "the difference in binding energies among different quarkonia indicate that they melt in a hot qgp at different temperatures and the quarkonium spectrum can serve as plasma thermometer @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath12 have smaller binding energies as compared to ground state @xmath5 and hence are expected to dissolve at a lower temperature . with the 2011 pbpb run the cms published results on sequential suppression of @xmath13 states as a function of centrality @xcite with enlarged statistics over their first measurement @xcite where a suppression of the excited @xmath0 states with respect to the ground state have been observed in pbpb collisions compared to pp collisions at @xmath9 tev .",
    "the quarkonia yields in heavy ion collisions are also modified due to non - qgp effects such as shadowing , an effect due to change of the parton distribution functions inside the nucleus , and dissociation due to nuclear or comover interactions @xcite . due to higher mass",
    ", the nuclear suppression is expected to be less for bottomonia over charmonia .",
    "if large number of heavy quarks are produced in initial heavy ion collisions at lhc energy this could even lead to enhancement of quarkonia via statistical recombination @xcite .",
    "the effect of regeneration is expected to be less significant for bottomonia as compared to charmonia since bottom quarks are much smaller in number as compared to charm quarks .",
    "in addition , due to higher bottom mass the bound state properties obtained from potential models are more reliable .",
    "thus recent years witness a shift in the interest to bottomonia",
    ". the ratios of the yields of excited states to the ground states is considered even more robust qgp probe as the cold nuclear matter effects if any cancel out and can be neglected in the ratios .",
    "the calculation of ratios of @xmath0 states was also made in few works e.g. @xcite in past which showed that the @xmath8 dependence of such ratio would show large variations and this would be a direct probe of the qgp .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the bottomonia suppression due to color screening in an expanding qgp using the model by chu and matsui @xcite , which takes into account the finite qgp lifetime and spatial extent .",
    "we start by describing the properties of quarkonia obtained from potential models and then give a brief description of the model which is extended to get the survival probabilities of @xmath0 states as a function of centrality of the collisions .",
    "finally we compare the model calculations with the experimental data recently measured by the cms experiment .",
    "interaction between the heavy quark and its antiquark inside the quarkonium at zero temperature can be described by cornell potential @xcite .",
    "the solution of the schrodinger equation for such potential gives mass , bound state radius and the formation time @xmath14 , the time needed to form a bound state after the production of heavy quark pairs .",
    "all parameters obtained with zero temperature potential using the parameter values given in @xcite are summarized in first three rows of table i , which describe well the experimentally observed quarkonia spectroscopy .",
    "the potential model can be extended to finite temperature with the main assumption that medium effects can be accounted for as a temperature - dependent potential . instead of just looking at the individual bound states ( at @xmath15 = 0 where quarkonium is well defined )",
    ", one could rather obtain a unified treatment of bound states , threshold and continuum by determining the spectral function . using a class of screened potentials based on lattice calculations of the static quark - antiquark free energy , spectral functions at finite temperature",
    "are calculated in a work @xcite and it was found that all quarkonium states , except the 1s bottomonium , dissolve in the deconfined phase at temperatures smaller than 1.5@xmath16",
    ". an upper limit on binding energy and the thermal width of different quarkonia states are then estimated using spectral functions in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "corresponding upper bounds on their dissociation temperatures @xmath17 @xcite are given in second last row of table i. we used slightly lower values of @xmath17 given in the last row to obtain a good match with measured @xmath10 .    [ prop ]",
    "the bottomonia survival probabilities due to color screening in an expanding qgp are estimated using a dynamical model which takes into account the finite lifetime and spatial extent of the system @xcite .",
    "the competition between the resonance formation time @xmath14 and the plasma characteristics such as temperature , lifetime and spatial extent decide the @xmath18 dependence of the survival probabilities of @xmath0 sates . we describe the essential steps used to develop the model which is then extended to get the survival probabilities as a function of centrality of the collision .",
    "the model assumes that quark gluon plasma is formed at some initial entropy density @xmath19 corresponding to initial temperature @xmath20 at time @xmath21 which undergoes an isentropic expansion by bjorken s hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the plasma cools to an entropy density @xmath22 corresponding to the dissociation temperature @xmath23 in time @xmath24 which is given by @xmath25 as long as @xmath24/@xmath14 @xmath26 1 , quarkonium formation will be suppressed .    in the finite system produced in heavy ion collision , the suppression and entropy depend on the size of the system .",

    "( [ bjork ] ) and eq .",

    "let a @xmath33 pair is created at the position @xmath34 in the transverse plane with a transverse momentum @xmath35 and transverse energy @xmath36 = @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath0 formation time is @xmath38 which on equating with the screening duration @xmath39 given in eq  ( [ tdr ] ) one obtains the critical radius @xmath40 , which is the boundary of the suppression region as @xmath41 where @xmath42 = @xmath43 is the lorentz factor associated with the transverse motion of the pair .",
