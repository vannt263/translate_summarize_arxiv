    "first , results computed with the `` j0 '' and `` j3 '' method can be compared .",
    "second , predictions with various choices for the electron - proton coupling are confronted with one another .",
    "the validity of the ia is then established whenever the final result happens to become independent of the adopted choice . in order to assess the degree to which this independence is realized , we have considered ratios of structure functions for some fixed kinematics but calculated with different choices for the electron - proton coupling . as a benchmark calculation , we have computed @xmath1c@xmath133b@xmath134 observables in quasi - elastic kinematics for several values of the four - momentum transfer .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[fig : curr03 ] and [ fig : curr12 ] .",
    "fig.[fig : curr03 ] shows for several observables the ratio of the values obtained with the `` j3 '' scheme to the corresponding prediction using the `` j0 '' scheme .",
    "[ fig : curr12 ] shows the ratio of the strengths obtained with the @xmath139 vertex function compared to the corresponding predictions with the @xmath144 form .",
    "remark that in the limit of vanishing off - shell effects , these ratios should equal one .",
    "it is indeed found that the calculations that are based on the substitution @xmath145 , tend to converge to those based on @xmath146 with increasing energy transfer .",
    "this is particularly the case at low missing momenta , where the decrease in the longitudinal response is almost exponential .",
    "the overall behaviour is identical for the higher missing momentum case ( @xmath147 = 150  mev / c ) , but the rate of decrease is somewhat slower .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that at higher momenta , hence , greater angles , the transverse components of the vertex functions play a more important role . looking at fig.[fig : curr12 ] one can essentially draw the same conclusions .",
    "the predictions with the different prescriptions also converge to each other as the energy is increased . again",
    "this convergence is more pronounced for the low missing momentum case .",
    "this feature is most apparent in the purely transverse channel , which dominates the cross section at sufficiently high energies .",
    "it appears thus as if off - shell ambiguities , speaking in terms of strenghts and absolute cross sections , are of far less concern at higher @xmath7 than they used to be in the @xmath148 1  ( gev / c)@xmath4 region , where most of the data have been accumulated up to now . the interference structure functions @xmath141 and @xmath138 are subject to off - shell ambiguities that are apparently extending to the highest four - momentum transfers considered here .",
    "this feature was already established in ref .",
    "@xcite and explained by referring to the large weight of the negative energy solutions in the interference structure functions @xmath138 and @xmath141 .",
    "recently , there have been several claims for strong indications for genuine ( or , `` dynamic '' ) relativistic effects in a@xmath12 observables @xcite . in an attempt to implement some of these effects in calculations based on a schrdinger picture ,",
    "several techniques to obtain a `` relativized version '' of the electron - nucleus vertex have been developed . in leading order in a @xmath149 expansion these `` relativized ''",
    "electron - nucleus vertices typically miss the coupling between the lower components in the bound and scattering states .",
    "for that reason , we interpret the effect of the coupling between the lower components in the bound and scattering states as a measure for the importance of relativistic effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig : relativity ] we display results of fully relativistic @xmath1c@xmath133b@xmath134 calculations and calculations in which the specific coupling between the lower components in the bound and scattering states have been left out .",
    "we consider quasi - elastic conditions and study the @xmath5 evolution of the structure functions for two values of the missing momentum ( @xmath147 = 0 and 150 mev / c ) both corresponding with small recoil angles .",
    "hence , the results of fig .  [ fig : relativity ] refer to kinematic conditions for which the eikonal approximation is justified .",
    "a rather complex and oscillatory @xmath5 dependence of the relativistic effects emerges from our numerical calculations .",
    "looking first at the @xmath150 0  mev / c case , which nearly corresponds with parallel kinematics , we observe that for both the longitudinal and transverse structure functions , the impact of the coupling amongst the lower components first increases , and then tends to become fairly constant for higher values of @xmath57 .",
    "the genuine relativistic effect stemming from the coupling between the lower components in the initial and final states is larger in the longitudinal than in the transverse channel .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the cross section the impact of the `` relativistic dynamical effects '' never exceeds the 10 % level .",
    "if we turn our attention to the interference structure functions @xmath138 and @xmath141 , the relativistic effects grow in importance . especially for the @xmath138 structure function",
    "the effects are large and extend to the smallest values of @xmath5 considered here .",
    "this enhanced sensitivity of the @xmath138 response to relativistic effects , even when relatively low values of @xmath5 are probed , complies with the conclusions drawn in other studies @xcite .",
    "also the tendency of the relativistic effects to increase the cross section when higher values of @xmath132 are probed complies with the findings of earlier studies @xcite .",
    "a quantity that is relatively easy to access experimentally and depends heavily upon the @xmath138 term , is the so - called left - right asymmetry @xmath151 @xmath152 in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] we have plotted the left - right asymmetry for both @xmath122 and @xmath123 knockout from @xmath2o in the kinematics of fig .  [ fig : gaofig ] .",
    "it is indeed verified that the asymmetry is very sensitive to relativistic effects .",
    "as has been reported , relativistic effects enhance the asymmetry further , and this enhancement is more pronounced for the @xmath122 knockout reaction . the role played by the lower components in this dynamical enhancement of the left - right asymmetry",
    "can be further clearified by looking at the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : q2asym ] . in this figure , we plot the left - right asymmetry for @xmath123 knockout from @xmath1c , for different @xmath7 and quasi - elastic conditions . looking at the fully relativistic curves , we observe a gradual decrease of the asymmetry with increasing @xmath7 . at the same time , the relative contribution of the `` non - relativistic '' contribution to @xmath151 diminishes .",
    "this feauture indicates that the asymmetry @xmath151 is nearly exclusively generated by the coupling between the lower components as @xmath5 increases .",
    "we have outlined a fully relativistic eikonal framework for calculating cross sections for @xmath0 reactions from spherical nuclei at intermediate and high four - momentum transfers and carried out @xmath1c@xmath0 and @xmath2o@xmath0 calculations for a variety of kinematical conditions , thereby covering four - momentum transfers in the range @xmath153 ( gev / c)@xmath4 .",
    "our results illustrate that the validity of the eikonal method is confined to proton emission in a cone with a relatively small opening angle about the direction of the virtual photon s momentum .",
    "this observation puts serious constraints on the applicability of the glauber method , that is based on the eikonal approximation , for modelling the final - state interactions in high - energy @xmath0 reactions from nuclei .",
    "incorporation of the inelastic channels in the eikonal method is however needed to fully appreciate the limits of the glauber model , and work along these lines is in progress . in line with the expectations ,",
    "our investigations illustrate that the uncertainties induced by off - shell ambiguities on the calculated observables diminish as @xmath5 increases .",
    "nevertheless , in the relativistic eikonal framework four - momentum transfers of the order 5  ( gev / c)@xmath9 appear necessary to assure that the effect of the off - shell ambiguities can be brought down to the percent level . our theoretical framework permits to assess the impact of the relativistic effects over a wide energy range .",
    "the impact of the lower components on the @xmath0 observables is observed to be significant over the whole @xmath5 range studied .",
    "especially the left - right asymmetry lends itself very well to study these effects of genuine relativistic origin .",
