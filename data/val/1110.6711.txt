    "according to observations @xcite , a dark energy ( de ) component is needed to explain the apparent acceleration of the universe . in the model , einstein s general relativity ( gr ) is modified by a tiny constant @xmath1 . with this deviation from the bare ricci scalar in the einstein - hilbert action",
    ", the universe accelerates according to cosmic background , supernovae and large scale observations @xcite .",
    "various other means to introduce the accelerated expansion into the field equations include cosmological scalar fields with gravitational interactions @xcite , as well as vector fields @xcite , string theory and higher dimension inspired models @xcite as well as several type of gravity modifigations @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 modified gravity theories @xcite , where the einstein - hilbert action is generalized as a function of the ricci scalar , provide natural alternatives for dark energy that needs new physics to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe . in these models some subdominant terms in the action functional become essential in very large scales .    in the present paper ,",
    "the @xmath0 theories of modified gravity are studied .",
    "that include an action function with a suitable function of the ricci scalar .",
    "the observed large scale defects could then be explained by the deviation from einstein - hilbert gravity . however , einstein - hilbert gravity is well tested within solar system length scales and at low energies @xcite .",
    "therefore we , focus on models considered as alternatives for the concordance model with gr like behaviour at solar system scale .",
    "when the modification in the action functional is written using auxiliary scalar fields ( as in quintessence and scalar - tensor teories @xcite ) , the new effects of gravity can be interpreted as scalar - field - matter interactions .",
    "chameleon @xmath0 models @xcite allow the mass of the scalar field to vary according to the local matter density and give rise to non - linear self - interactions . with chameleon behaviour ,",
    "correction to the newtonian gravitational potential may be small in high curvature regimes ( near the sun ) and the metric therefore close to schwarzschild - de sitter solution .",
    "there are many @xmath0 models that can produce correct shift from matter domination to radiation domination and to the currently accelerating epoch ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , constraints from structure formation and stability conditions are satisfied by various models @xcite .",
    "since gravity is most rigorously tested at local scales and with low energies , tangible @xmath0 model must be able to settle to the observed gr values within this regime .",
    "@xmath0 models that pass all the above mentioned tests are scarce . among current viable f(r ) models are @xcite . in the present paper we study hu and sawicki @xmath0-model ( hs ) numerically to test if it locally deviates from gr .",
    "it has non - linear rational action functional and seems to follow locally the chameleon mechanism .    while the metric outside a spherically symmetric body in gr must be the schwarzchild - de sitter space - time according to birkhoff s theorem @xcite",
    ", this does not hold for a spherically symmetric matter distributions in non - trivial @xmath0 theories , like in the hs - model . in these theories ,",
    "the way space - time outside the mass distribution depends on the solution inside , is more complex @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have compared static spherically symmetric bodies with a polytropic equation of state within the hs model and in einsteinian gravity .",
    "we also calculate the mass of auxiliary scalar degree of freedom and find it to be high enough to evade the `` fifth force '' problem @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first in section [ eqns ] the gravitational framework is discussed , in section [ sphsymm ] the polytropic configuration and the surrounding spacetime is constrained and in section [ numerical ] the numerical work is represented .",
    "finally in section [ conclu ] we discuss the results .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 gravity action @xcite of the form s = , where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "the corresponding field equations , derived in the metric formalism , are f(r ) r_-12 f(r ) g_-(__-g _ ) f(r)=8 g t_. here @xmath4 is the standard minimally coupled stress - energy tensor for perfect fluid and @xmath5 . contracting the field equations we get the trace equation f(r)r - 2 f(r ) + 3f(r ) = 8 g ( - 3 p ) . which can be used as one independent dynamical equation .    as usual",
    ", the matter term needs to obey the equation of continuity @xmath6 .",
    "the only non - trivial component for spherically symmetric system is p=-(+p ) , where comma stands for radial derivative , @xmath7 .    like in gr ,",
    "the equation of continuity is automatically satisfied here if the field equations are satisfied @xcite and no additional information is gained . in this work we chose the continuity equation to be one of the solved dynamical equations instead of using the full set of field equations . therefore , as the set of independent equations we use the @xmath8-component of equation ( [ eequs ] ) , the trace equation ( [ traceq ] ) , the definition for the ricci scalar in terms of metric components and the continuity equation ( [ cont ] ) .      as there are still several physically acceptable @xmath0 models we chose the hu - sawicki model for numerical purposes .",
    "this model is able to reproduce @xmath9 at high curvature when the @xmath0 function is expanded .",
    "it also reproduces correct matter domination and the current accelerated eras and avoids ostrogradski and matter instabilities @xcite .",
    "this particular model also vanishes for flat space - time , @xmath10 , and is able to produce the asymptotic limit @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "the action function for the hu - sawicki model is given by @xcite f(r)_hs = r - m^2 .",
    "this contains three essential parameters , a positive real number @xmath13 and a positive integer @xmath14 .",
    "the mass scale @xmath15 can be always included in parameters @xmath13 , but it is convenient to use it as the mass scale as in the paper @xcite : m^2 = ( 8315 ) ^-2 ( ) , where @xmath16 is the reduced hubble parameter and @xmath17 in our work .",
    "the authors of @xcite study the solar system behaviour of the model by an approximated @xmath0 function .",
    "they conclude , that the model should correctly arrive at the solar system value outside a sun like matter distribution because the scalar degree of freedom is locked to the general relativistic value out through the solar corona @xcite .",
    "the approximate solution for ( [ fhs ] ) in high curvature ( when @xmath18 ) gives accordingly an effective model when the @xmath0 function is expanded . by approximating the @xmath0 function to begin with ,",
    "the non - linearity of the modified equations that allow the birkhoff s theorem to be violated , is not taken fully into account .    in the present paper",
    "the above assumption is tested by using the full non - linear , rational action function with the non - linear field equations .",
    "we , therefore , numerically study whether the approximation of the rational function ( [ fhs ] ) , that makes the solution fully merge with the general relativistic space - time around a polytrope , is appropriate .",
    "this is important because the model is currently used as a viable de model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one useful way to study this family of @xmath0 models is to write ( [ fhs ] ) as : f(r)=r-+ .",
    "now one finds that only when the ricci scalar @xmath19 is near the vacuum value @xmath20 , can the third term contribute to .",
    "however , because of the non - linearity of the field equations , behaviour of the solution may be different from .",
    "the system was first required to give the correct static vacuum value @xmath21 with the trace equation ( [ traceq ] ) .",
    "this restricted the initial - parameter space considerably .",
    "moreover only analytical and regular solutions at the origin were considered , by demanding the solutions to reach a finite value at the origin @xcite .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric , static configurations and adopt the metric for this configuration : ds^2=b(r)dt^2-a(r)dr^2-r^2(d^2-^2 d^2 ) .",
    "sds - metric describes an expanding vacuum solution of the einstein field equations . in order to test whether the studied modified gravity polytrope can really reproduce the general relativity weak field limit ,",
    "the metric of the hs - polytrope is compared to the sds - metric on the boundary of the spherical matter distribution ,    further , parametrized post - newtonian parameters are compared to observations in order to determine the relevance of the sds - solutions in the solar system .",
    "derivation of the parameter by fitting the general metric ( [ metric ] ) to the ppn sds - solution , was done in @xcite .",
    "the used parameter is _",
    "ppn= , here the cosmological term @xmath22 is neglected because it is vanishingly small within solar system .",
    "we use standard polytropic configurations that resemble young sun - like solar mass main sequence stars .",
    "we chose a solar polytrope as the reference star with polytropic index @xmath23 .",
    "this is the so called eddington model and it is given by the general relativistic tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "this model is able to reproduce the observed solar mass and radius rather well with a simple set of equations and initial conditions .    as self gravitating globes of gas ,",
    "the stars are kept in hydrodynamic equilibrium with the equilibrium condition p x^ = ( + ) f_. here @xmath24 is the gravitational force @xcite .",
    "the tov equation is defined with the hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ hydroeql ] ) and spherically symmetric metric ( [ metric ] ) .    as static stellar objects ,",
    "we consider perfect fluid solutions with polytropic equation of state and parametrization p&=&k^ + & = & 1 + .",
    "the index @xmath23 gives the eddington polytropic solution for the lane - emden ( le ) equations for solar mass @xmath25 and radius @xmath26 .",
    "according to @xcite the solar polytropic model with index @xmath23 is not stabile with respect to jacobi stability analysis .",
    "the solar polytropic index is stabile within linear stability analysis and kosambi - cartan - chern theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the polytropic index values : ( 11 + 8)/7 n_p 5 would conform to also jacobi stabile polytropes .",
    "however , when departing from the solar index the radius - mass relation changes dramatically .",
    "the behaviour of the polytropic star with the used field equations would also change for this index and new degrees of freedom would be needed in the analysis .",
    "the interconnected lane - emden coefficients ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 in ( [ polytr ] ) and scale length @xmath29 in le equations @xcite ) need to be chosen correctly in order to obtain a star that best describes the sun .",
    "lane - emden equations for a polytropic configuration are derived from the general relativistic tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff equations .",
    "we also derived general relativistic model , for reference , using the ansaz described in section ( [ eqns ] ) .",
    "this model is of course identical to the le polytrope .",
    "the standardized eddington model was chosen for this study , because it is considered to be in good resemblance with the standard solar model @xcite with the central density _",
    "i=_=76.5 ^-3 .",
    "we varied the central density of the eddington polytrope in order to find statistically significant differences or similarities between the modified gravity polytropes and general relativistic ones .",
    "also , other realistic main sequence stars ( @xmath30 ) were searched from larger polytropic parameter space with @xmath0 gravity .",
    "but as in the case of general relativistic @xmath23 polytropes , the only possible configurations are those with the solar mass .",
    "this occurs because ( see ( 11.3.18 ) in @xcite ) m~r^(3 - 4)/(-2 ) .",
    "the mass @xmath31 is constant for the eddington model @xmath23 .",
    ".observational constraints from solar system missions : cassini spacecraft mission @xcite , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) @xcite , lunar laser ranging ( llr ) tests of general relativity @xcite and the mercury perihelion shift measurements @xcite .",
    "the constraints for @xmath32 are not discussed in this paper , as the cassini mission results give the most stringent limits for sds here even for @xmath33 [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath0-model is stabile with respect to short - timescale instabilities @xcite if @xmath34 is positive .",
    "for the present model , this stability condition is satisfied with extremely small @xmath34 everywhere inside and near the polytrope .",
    "the mass term within the corresponding brans - dicke framework , is dependent on a @xmath35 term .",
    "the mass of the scalar , @xmath36 , is allways big enough for the `` fifth force '' problem to be evaded for these polytropic configurations .",
    "although , hu - sawicki polytropes are very similar to the young sun like stars in gr , only one third of the hs polytropes in a typical 29 000 polytrope run have parameter within the experimental cassini limits @xcite .",
    "many @xmath0 models result in @xmath37 @xcite , far from the gr value @xmath38 .",
    "the studied hs - model is different in this respect although not fully consistent with the observations . for the hu - sawicki -model ,",
    "@xmath39 value is nearly one everywhere in our model parameter space .",
    "however , the @xmath40 space - time around a spherically symmetric configuration with a polytropic equation of state nearly always converges to a different space - time than is allowed by gr .",
    "the non - linearity of the system poses difficulties , and very high accuracy was not feasible . with a sufficient numerical accuracy",
    "all the @xmath41 models were solvable .",
    "furthermore , even as the numerical accuracy was increased @xmath42 value does not converge to @xmath43 .    with only @xmath44 of the @xmath39 values reaching the observational limits with the hu - sawicki gravity , it is obvious that hs - model does not easily reach the schwarzchild - de sitter solution outside a polytropic stellar configuration .",
    "this model , therefore , seems to require some fine - tuning of the initial scalar curvature in order to reproduce general relativistic sds space - time outside the surface of a sun - like hs polytrope .",
    "the scalar curvature is always unstabile near the center , so no specific value can be attached to the hs polytrope , that would exactly correspond to the general relativistic polytropic sun .    to get away from this fine - tuning a physical super selection rule",
    "might exist .",
    "we do not suggest any mechanism for this , however , we would like to note that the sun is the only star for which the sds space - time is measured to be correct with good accuracy .",
    "could it be , that other sun like young stars that can be modeled with a polytropic equation of state , might arrive at a slightly different vacuum than sds ?",
    "in this case hs -model would , indeed , describe the space - time around young main sequence stars more accurately .",
    "the short - timescale instabilities are avoided with extremely small and positive @xmath34 .",
    "also , the scalar field mass within the brans - dicke scenario becomes large , as @xmath45 contains a term proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the solutions do not change notably in the mass , radius and @xmath39 when the hu - sawicki parameters are varied .",
    "this indicates that only the ratio @xmath46 , which is fixed , is effective for @xmath47 .",
    "however , the @xmath39 value is naturally dependent on the initial central density @xmath48 , that was varied throughout the numerical studies .    with a different polytropic equation of state ,",
    "some white dwarfs and neutron stars can be modeled .",
    "work is under way to test the space - time specifically around @xmath0 low density white dwarfs and neutron star -polytropes .",
    "moreover it would be interesting to study numerically also other proposed well - behaving action functions .",
