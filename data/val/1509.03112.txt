    "the masses of hadrons composed of light quarks such as the proton and @xmath5 meson are understood to originate from the energy of the confining interactions of qcd ; however , it is unclear why the typical hadron mass scale is of order @xmath6 gev .",
    "one would expect this mass scale to be explicitly present in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "however , the only scale in @xmath7 are the quark masses , which for the up and down quarks , are evidently too small to be relevant : @xmath8 gev .",
    "a relevant mass scale , @xmath9 , however , does exist .",
    "it controls the strength of the coupling of quarks when they interact at short distances .",
    "its precise definition emerges when one renormalizes the qcd coupling @xmath2 .",
    "the results presented in this talk can be discussed in any choice of renormalization scheme , but we will use here the value of @xmath9 defined in the @xmath10 ( modified minimal subtraction ) renormalization scheme .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath11 can be determined to high precision from experimental measurements of high - energy , short - distance processes where the strength of qcd is small because of asymptotic freedom  @xcite and perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is thus applicable .",
    "one long - sought goal in qcd is to find an explicit relation between the hadron masses and @xmath9 .    in this talk",
    "we present such relation  @xcite , which leads to the prediction of the value of @xmath9 from a hadronic mass .",
    "conversely , one can obtain the hadronic spectrum using @xmath9 .",
    "to establish this relation , we use the qcd effective coupling @xmath4 computed at small - distance using pqcd and at long distance using the formalism of qcd on the light front which allows , under reasonable approximations , non - perturbative calculations .",
    "we will also use  light - front holography \" to determine the precise form of @xmath2 at small @xmath12 the small and large distance regimes of qcd overlap , a phenomenon related to  quark - hadron duality \"  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to match the two descriptions and obtain the behavior of @xmath2 at any scale .",
    "this in turn leads to an analytical relation between @xmath9 and hadron masses .",
    "the light - front ( lf ) quantization procedure is based on the  front form \" invented by dirac  @xcite , where the time evolution variable is @xmath13 ; _",
    "i.e , _ time along the light - front . the resulting lf hamiltonian and its eigensolutions are lorentz frame - independent  @xcite",
    ".    one can derive a one - dimensional  light - front schrdinger equation \" ( lfse ) in qcd describing the valence fock state of color - singlet @xmath14 mesons for light quarks , analogous to the schrdinger equation describing hydrogenic atoms in qed  @xcite . unlike the qed form , the lfse is relativistic and frame - independent .",
    "the radial variable for the lfse , the invariant separation between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is conjugate to the lf kinetic energy @xmath19 , the invariant mass squared of the @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the transverse impact parameter and @xmath22 is the lf momentum fraction @xmath23 .",
    "the lfse incorporates color confinement and other essential spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron physics , including a massless pion for zero quark mass and linear regge trajectories with the same slope in the radial quantum number @xmath24 and internal orbital angular momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the form of the lf potential @xmath26 entering the lfse -its sole unspecified component- becomes uniquely determined as a harmonic oscillator @xmath27 when one extends the formalism of de alfaro , fubini and furlan ( daff )  @xcite to light - front hamiltonian theory  @xcite .",
    "this discovery by daff , in the context of @xmath28 quantum mechanics , allows for the emergence in the theory of a mass scale @xmath29 without it appearing explicitly in the lagrangian . that is , enforcing the conformal symmetry of qcd fully determines the confinement potential @xmath30 in the lfse underlying the hadron spectrum",
    ".    the harmonic oscillator form of the lf potential corresponds to a linear potential for bound states of heavy quarks in the usually employed instant - form  @xcite .",
    "this links a semi - classical approximation to light - front qcd , based on the underlying conformality of qcd in the limit of zero quark masses , to lattice gauge theory and other approaches to heavy quark effective theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is obtained from a hadron mass , e.g. @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this provides a rather model - independent tractable formalism for addressing the non - perturbative qcd bound - state problem at leading order .",
    "we have stressed the importance of the conformal symmetry for qcd .",
    "the conformal group in four dimensions is geometrically represented by the five - dimensional ads@xmath32 space .",
    "it is holographically dual to 3 + 1 spacetime using light - front time @xmath33 . in this correspondence",
    "the lf variable @xmath34 can be identified with the fifth ads dimension . for hadrons probed at short distances @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the 4-momentum squared exchanged between the hadron and a beam particle .",
    "remarkably , the same confining lf potential @xmath27 and the same lfse for mesons of arbitrary spin @xmath37 can be derived  @xcite from the  soft - wall model \"  @xcite modification of ads@xmath32 space assuming the specific  dilaton profile \" @xmath38 .",
    "using lf holography , one can identifies the fifth dimension coordinate @xmath39 of ads@xmath32 space with the light - front coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "this correspondence , often called ads / qcd , is well established : there exists a one - to - one mapping between lf and ads wavefunctions .",
    "furthermore , the expressions for the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of hadrons in ads@xmath32 are the same as the drell - yan west formula in 3 + 1 space using lf time  @xcite .",
    "all in all , the ads / qcd correspondence provides an excellent description of hadrons of arbitrary spin , incorporating many of observed spectroscopic and dynamical features  @xcite .",
    "one can derive the explicit form for @xmath2 from lf - qcd using ads / qcd .",
    "as noted above , the forces that bind quarks are related in ads / qcd to the modification of the ads space curvature , the dilaton profile @xmath38 encoding confinement dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this modification of the ads geometry is constrained by the form of the potential dictated by the daff mechanism .",
    "the same constraint also prescribes the form of @xmath4 at small @xmath36 .    in pqcd",
    ", the effective coupling @xmath2 is defined at high @xmath36 by folding short - distance quantum effects into its evolution .",
    "analogously , as we will show , the @xmath36-dependence of the ads / qcd effective coupling stems from the effects of the large - distance forces folded into the coupling constant  @xcite .    to determine @xmath40 ,",
    "consider first the ads action .",
    "it has the same form as general relativity s action : @xmath41 but with @xmath42 , the ricci scalar , and @xmath43 , newton s constant , replaced by their qcd - analogs .",
    "thus @xmath44 is replaced by the gluon field @xmath45 , @xmath46 corresponds to the gauge coupling @xmath47 , and the metric determinant is @xmath48 , which includes the @xmath49 dilaton profile .",
    "the 5-dimensional ads action is thus : @xmath50 in pqcd , @xmath51 acquires its @xmath36-dependence from short - distance quantum effects . similarly , the initially constant ads coupling @xmath52 is redefined to absorb the effects of the ads deformation : @xmath53 . transforming to momentum space yields  @xcite @xmath54 here , @xmath55 ,",
    "the effective charge in the @xmath56-scheme defined from the bjorken sum rule  @xcite , is normalized to @xmath57 at @xmath58 due to fulfill straightforward kinematical constraints  @xcite .",
    "this coupling can serve as the qcd - analog of the gell - mann - low coupling @xmath59 of qed  @xcite . since lf - holography neglects quantum effects , the short - distance phenomena which lead to the pqcd evolution of the running of pqcd coupling",
    "are not incorporated in @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , the gaussian form of eq .",
    "( [ alphaads ] ) falls much faster than the pqcd prediction at large @xmath36 .",
    "the large @xmath36-dependence of @xmath61 is well known  @xcite .",
    "its evolution is given by the qcd renormalization group equation where the logarithmic derivative of the coupling defines the @xmath62 function .",
    "if @xmath4 is small , one can use the perturbative expansion : @xmath63 the @xmath64 for @xmath65 are scheme - dependent and are known up to order @xmath66 in the @xmath1 renormalization scheme  @xcite .",
    "( [ beta ] ) thus yields @xmath67 at high @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , @xmath68 can be expressed as a perturbative expansion in @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "thus , pqcd predicts the form of @xmath69 at large @xmath36 : @xmath70.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath71 are known up to order @xmath72  @xcite .     the strong coupling obtained from the analytic matching of perturbative and non - perturbative qcd regimes .",

    "( [ alphaads ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha_g1 from bj sr ] ) thus provide @xmath69 in the large and small distance regimes , respectively .",
    "the existence at moderate values of @xmath36 of a dual description of qcd in terms of either quarks and gluons versus hadrons (  quark - hadron duality \"  @xcite ) is consistent with the matching of @xmath75 to @xmath40 at intermediate values of @xmath36 .",
    "this matching can be done by imposing continuity of both @xmath69 and their derivatives , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : matching ] .",
    "the unique solution for the resulting two equalities determines @xmath9 from @xmath29 , and fixes the scale @xmath76 characterizing the transition between the large and short - distance regimes of qcd . at leading - order",
