    "the _ chandra _ multiwavelength project ( champ ) will combine radio to x - ray observations of serendipitous _",
    "chandra _ sources , with emphasis on optical identification .",
    "the champ is superior to previous x - ray surveys because of ( 1 ) unprecedented x - ray positional accuracy ( @xmath6 ) , ( 2 ) x - ray flux limits 20 times deeper than current wide area surveys ( down to @xmath7 erg  s@xmath1  @xmath2 ) , ( 3 ) larger sky coverage ( @xmath8 8 deg@xmath9 ) per year than current deep surveys .",
    "* the x - ray luminosity function * at @xmath10 is described as    @xmath11    @xmath12 + where l@xmath13 is the x - ray luminosity in @xmath14 erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "the redshift evolution of the luminosity function is characterized by    @xmath15    continuity of the luminosity function at the break luminosity requires that    @xmath16    the total number @xmath17 of quasars in the sample is obtained by integrating the luminosity function over luminosity and volume , i.e. ,    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the solid angle covered by the survey as a function of redshift and luminosity .",
    "the parameters of the x - ray luminosity function determined by boyle et al .",
    "( 1993 ) are as follows : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . following comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we have used k=2.6 and increased the the normalization @xmath24 by 20% .    * the x - ray logn - logs curve * : using the above luminosity function we derived the number density of quasars as a function of observed flux .",
    "the luminosity function was integrated over the luminosity range @xmath25 erg s@xmath1 and the redshift range @xmath26 .",
    "h@xmath27 and q@xmath28 were assumed throughout .",
    "the predicted logn - logs curve is shown in figure 1 .    since the unabsorbed sources dominate at the faint end in the soft x - ray range , and since they are likely to be observed at high redshift , in the present analysis we will concentrate on unabsorbed sources only .",
    "the absorbed sources would contribute an additional @xmath8 60% ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) , making the total number consistent with the extrapolation of the empirical determination of logn - logs ( hasinger et al .",
    "the flux of unabsorbed quasars is given by @xmath29 and in the soft x - ray band , @xmath30 is typically 1.3 .",
    "* the champ sky coverage * : the champ cycle 1 consists of 85 extragalactic fields , |b|@xmath31 . from all the chandra cycle 1 fields we have excluded ( 1 ) deep fields of pi survey observations , ( 2 ) fields with extended sources & planetary targets , ( 3 ) acis sub - arrays and continuous clocking modes .",
    "see figure 2 for champ sky coverage as a function of flux limit .",
    "* cumulative number distribution in champ : * integrating the predicted logn - logs over the champ sky coverage , we obtained the cumulative number distribution of quasars in the champ fields ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the total number in soft band is expected to be over 1500 for unabsorbed sources and over 2500 total .",
    "* predicted redshift distribution : * the histogram ( figure 4 ) shows the predicted number distribution of quasars in champ fields . over 200 quasars will be detected in the redshift range @xmath3 and over 400 quasars in @xmath4 .",
