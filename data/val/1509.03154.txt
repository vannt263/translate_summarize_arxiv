    "transiting planets , which transit in front of their host stars , are especially important research objects among exoplanets , as when combined with radial velocity measurements , they can provide us various information about the nature of exoplanets such as the mass , radius , density , orbital obliquity , and atmosphere .",
    "most of transiting planets have been discovered by transit surveys which monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars .",
    "several groups have worked or been working on ground - based transit surveys @xcite , and corot@xcite and kepler@xcite have performed space - based transit surveys . moreover , the second epoch mission of kepler , namely k2@xcite , is now ongoing , and next generation space missions tess@xcite and plato@xcite have been approved to be launched around 2017 and 2024 , respectively .",
    "the biggest problem for transit surveys , especially for ground - based ones , is commingling of false positives with candidates of transiting planets .",
    "the cause of false positives of transiting planets are eclipsing binaries , as they mimic planetary transits by grazing or by being mixed in another bright star s brightness .",
    "thus it is important to conduct follow - up observations after transit surveys in order to validate candidates as true planets by eliminating false positives .",
    "high precision multi - color transit photometry is known to be useful for such follow - up observations to discriminate whether transit - like dimming is caused by a true planet or by an eclipsing binary @xcite .",
    "this is because a true planet is almost dark in all wavelength , while an intervening body of an eclipsing binary is bright itself and its brightness changes significantly with wavelength .",
    "thus false positives caused by eclipsing binaries can be spotted by observing significant wavelength dependence in transit depths .",
    "on the other hand , transit depths of a true planet also have wavelength dependence .",
    "most of the wavelength dependence comes from the stellar limb - darkening , but the apparent planetary radius also has weak wavelength dependence which reflects the nature of its planetary atmosphere .",
    "high precision multi - color transit photometry is known to be useful to measure the weak wavelength dependence in transit depths to study atmospheres of transiting planets .",
    "this kind of study is known as transmission spectroscopy , and numbers of multi - color transit observations for this purpose have been reported so far .",
    "multi - color simultaneous cameras are very fruitful for the studies described above for two reasons .",
    "first , multi - color simultaneous cameras provide not only higher efficiency but also more feasibility to accomplish aimed studies than single - color cameras , since observable transits from a specific ground site are very limited .",
    "second , simultaneity of multi - color transit photometry is important to avoid systematic differences of transit depths due to luminosity change in host stars possibly caused by existence of starspots , plages , stellar activity , and so on .",
    "for the reasons , multi - color simultaneous cameras such as grond , busca@xcite , ultracam@xcite , sirius@xcite , and mitsume@xcite have been actively used for transit observations .",
    "considering the fact that more interesting transiting planets will be discovered in the near future by advanced ground - based surveys , and also space - based surveys , like k2 , tess , and plato , developments of new multi - color simultaneous cameras are highly desired .",
    "we here report a development of such an astronomical instrument named muscat ( multi - color simultaneous camera for studying atmospheres of transiting planets ) , which is now installed on the 188 cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) in japan .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe designs of the optical system of muscat and its components ( sec .",
    "[ sect : design ] ) , and introduce the control system of muscat ( sec .",
    "[ sect : control ] ) .",
    "we then report characteristics and performances of muscat shown in engineering observations ( sec .",
    "[ sect : test ] ) .",
    "we discuss on some capabilities for future upgrade of muscat ( sec .",
    "[ sect : discussions ] ) , and finally summarize this paper ( sec .",
    "[ sect : summary ] ) .",
    "we have designed muscat considering the following conditions . as we plan to use muscat for validations of transiting planets discovered by transit surveys , at least 2 colors are necessary to discriminate eclipsing binaries from transiting planets .",
    "considering the cost and available research grants , we adopt a design for a 3-color simultaneous camera with the 3 colors in optical wavelength where ccds are sensitive . for transit observations , it is important to obtain good comparison stars in the field of view ( fov ) to achieve high precision transit photometry . for the reason , we have designed the muscat fov as wide as possible for the 188 cm telescope .",
    "we have also took care of the throughput ( tp ) of the instrument to achieve high photometric precision . to achieve higher sensitivity to the utmost extent ,",
    "we have carefully selected and designed the muscat optical system including astronomical bandpass filters , dichroic mirrors , and ccds ."
