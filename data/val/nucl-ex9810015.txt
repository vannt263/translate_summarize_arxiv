    "the modifications of the hadron properties and of the elementary couplings in the nuclear medium is one of the topics in nuclear physics currently addressed in various experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "the properties of baryon resonances in nuclei have been studied in recent photoabsorption experiments at frascati @xcite , mainz @xcite , and bonn @xcite .",
    "these showed significant medium effects : while the @xmath1-resonance is only slightly distorted , higher excited nucleon states n@xmath0 , in the second and third resonance region , are washed out .",
    "furthermore , for photon energy @xmath2 0.6 gev the absolute value of the cross section per nucleon is reduced , with respect to the free - nucleon case .",
    "the mechanism of this damping is not yet well understood . in the resonance region",
    "( 0.6 - 1.2 gev ) fermi - motion and pauli - blocking alone are unable to reproduce the resonance disappearance , therefore strong effects in the excitation , propagation and interaction of the baryon @xcite and meson @xcite resonances in the nuclear medium are advocated . at higher energies vector meson dominance ( vmd )",
    "models predict sizeable shadowing effects starting from about 2 gev @xcite .    in this paper",
    "are reported the results of the photoabsorption measurements on c , al , cu , sn and pb performed at bonn between 0.5 - 2.6 gev .",
    "the cross sections for c and pb have been already published @xcite . here",
    "the cross sections for the other nuclei are given along with the evaluation of the reduction and the density dependence of the photoabsorption strength in different energy regions .    in section 2 the experimental setup and method",
    "are extensively described .",
    "the analysis procedure is reported in section 3 . in section 4",
    "the results of the measurement are presented : specifically the cross sections , the ratio between photonuclear and photonucleon cross sections , and the nuclear density dependence .",
    "the photoabsorption measurements were performed using the photohadronic method .",
    "this method consists in measuring the photoproduction yield of hadronic events with a large solid angle detector , rejecting the vastly preponderant electromagnetic events by a separation using a forward angle shower detector .",
    "the photohadronic method was successfully applied in all previous measurements of the total photoabsorption cross section above the @xmath1-resonance excitation energy .",
    "the measurement was carried out at bonn using the saphir tagged photon beam @xcite of the elsa accelerator and an apparatus similar to the one previously used at frascati for nuclear photoabsorption measurements up to 1.2 gev@xcite . a schematic layout of the photon beam line and of the detector is given in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "the photon beam was produced by the bremsstrahlung of electrons extracted from the elsa accelerator into the saphir beam line .",
    "the energy of the scattered electrons was measured in the tagging system topas ii which also supplied the trigger for the events .",
    "the tagging system consisted of a bremsstrahlung radiator , a dipole magnet and a tagger made by two multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) placed in front of scintillation counters .    as a radiator ( r ) a copper foil 0.006@xmath3 thick ( @xmath3 being the radiation length ) has been used .",
    "the dipole magnet had a maximum deflecting power of 1.2 t@xmath4 m , corresponding to a maximum endpoint energy @xmath5 gev .",
    "for this measurement , the higher energy - resolution information from the mwpc of the tagger was not used and the photon energy was reconstructed from the timing hodoscope only .",
    "the latter consisted of 14 scintillator counters ( t1-t14 ) , each 4.5 cm thick and different in size , providing a photon energy resolution ranging from about 9% for the lowest energies to about 1% for the highest energies .",
    "the tagger covered the photon energy range @xmath6-@xmath7 . in this experiment",
    "the photon energy range 0.5 - 2.6 gev has been covered , with large overlapping regions at three electron beam energies @xmath8 = 1.6 , 2.2 and 2.8 gev .",
    "the photon beam passed through a set of collimators and the saphir apparatus .",
    "the three collimators c1-c3 defined a 1.5 cm diameter photon beam at the target position , while the three sweeping magnets m1-m3 strongly suppressed the charged background in the beam .",
    "the lead glass shower detector sd allowed the simultaneous measurement of the tagged photon flux for each tagging channel .",
    "the photon beam intensity and the tagging efficiency ( defined as the ratio between the number of tagged photons and the number of counts in the relevant tagging channel ) were measured on - line for each energy interval .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the tagging efficiencies of the 14 tagging channels measured at the three electron beam energies are shown .",
    "the values range between 0.73 and 0.92 , depending on both the photon and electron beam energies .",
    "the decrease observed for the first channels ( which correspond to the highest photon energies ) is due to both the moller - scattering and the background on the tagging counters .",
    "the decrease observed at the lowest electron beam energy is due to the wider bremsstrahlung photon emission angle and to the strong collimation cut .",
    "the tagging efficiencies were found stable within @xmath91% during the whole data taking , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for two sample tagging channels .",
    "solid targets ( t ) of c , al , cu , sn and pb were used .",
    "they had the form of disks 3 cm in diameter and thicknesses ranging between 0.08x@xmath10 for c to 0.2x@xmath10 for pb ( actual values are given in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the effective attenuation of the photon beam due to the electromagnetic interaction in the target was calculated for each nucleus as a function of the photon energy .",
    "the average photon beam attenuation ranged between 3% for c and 6.5% for pb .",
    "the targets were individually mounted on a suitable frame and moved into and off the photon beam by a remote control system ( rc ) .    in order to reduce effects due to possible changes in the electron beam ,",
    "empty frame measurements were regularly interspersed inside a complete cycle of target runs and their contributions were subtracted .",
    "the empty frame yields , mainly ascribed to the photon beam interactions on materials along the beam line and on the target frame , were equivalent to less than one g @xmath11 of lead and were found stable within @xmath9 0.8% during the whole measurement .",
    ".target t , thickness [ g/@xmath12 , yield ( # ) ( x@xmath13 ) , and average overall mc corrections ( @xmath14 ) at each electron beam energy @xmath8 [ gev ] . the empty frame ( ef ) yield is also given . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table3 ]      in order to better evaluate this strength reduction , the ratio between the nuclear cross section @xmath15 and that obtained for the free nucleons ( z@xmath16+n@xmath17 ) , derived from proton @xcite and deuteron data@xcite , has been calculated in each energy region .",
    "these ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , together with the results of a @xmath1-hole model @xcite and of two recent vmd calculations for c , cu and pb @xcite .",
    "the former calculation well reproduces the experimental behavior at lower energies , while both vmd calculations do not predict the systematic nuclear damping of the cross section clearly indicated by this experiment .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of two - nucleon correlations considered in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to an anti - shadowing behavior below 2 gev and thus to an even larger disagreement with the data .      for each nucleus",
    "the strength reduction was evaluated in the five energy regions of mean energy @xmath18 given in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "both the integral @xmath19 of the measured cross sections and the ratio @xmath20 were calculated . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the proton and neutron cross sections integrated over the relevant photon energies . in table",
    "[ table4 ] the averaged @xmath23 , computed weighting @xmath24 for each nucleus with its statistical error , is given . the energy behavior of @xmath23 is compared in fig .",
    "[ fig10]a ) with the one derived from data from previous experiments .",
    "the comparison evidences the good agreement between data in both the resonance and the shadowing regions . in the shadowing threshold region data from the present experiment evidence a photoabasorption strength reduction well above the experimental errors .",
    "in addition the nuclear density dependence of @xmath25 in each region was parameterized in the form @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the average nuclear density .",
    "the latter was derived from the experimental charge density distributions with the rms electron - scattering radius @xmath28 given in ref .",

[ fig10]b ) the coefficients @xmath34 obtained in each energy region from the fits to our data are shown .",
    "also shown are the @xmath34 derived from data from previous photoabsorption experiments .",
    "the energy behavior of @xmath34 is similar to the one of @xmath35 in the resonance region and above 3 gev .",
    "this indicates that the mechanisms responsible for the observed medium effects depend on the nuclear density .    on the contrary , in the shadowing threshold region",
    "the @xmath34 is positive while @xmath35 is less than unity , indicating a stronger strength reduction in the light nuclei .",
    "similar information can be obtained also from different reactions , specifically from electron scattering at low momentum transfer @xmath36 and from photon scattering at small - angle . then the @xmath34 have been derived from measurements of these reactions performed on a wide range of mass number @xcite , @xcite . in the framework of a vmd description the relevant quantity is the coherence length of the hadronic fluctuations of the photon @xmath37 in the laboratory frame , where @xmath38 is the vector - meson mass . at low energy",
    "the hadronic fluctuations of the photon are dominated by the @xmath39-meson .    therefore in fig .",
    "[ fig10bis ] the @xmath34 values are shown as a function of @xmath40 which is the coherence length when only the @xmath39-meson contribution is considered .",
    "the overall good agreement points out the consistency of total photoabsorption , electron scattering and photon scattering data .",
    "in particular , in the shadowing threshold region ( @xmath41 fm ) this agreement strengthens the evidence of a larger medium effect in light nuclei .",
    "this experimental finding may suggest in this region a different mechanism for the strength reduction , which does not depend on the nuclear density alone",
    ".    this could be due to the shadowing onset at lower energy for ligth nuclei .",
    "the shadowing effect at higher energy is generally described by vmd models .",
    "these models , which consider the photon as a superposition of a bare photon and vector mesons with @xmath14-function mass distribution , are able to reproduce the photo - nuclear absorption cross section in the several gev domain @xcite and shadowing phenomena observed in deep - inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering in the low x region ( x being the bjorken variable ) @xcite .    however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the two more recent vmd calculations for real photons @xcite clearly underestimate the shadowing effect below 3 gev .",
    "therefore , a model which takes into account a more realistic spectral function of the low mass hadronic components should be considered in order to better reproduce the photoabsorption data .",
    "in addition , a possible change of the vector - meson properties in the nuclear medium ( a reduction of the vector - meson mass @xcite and the modifications of the @xmath39-meson spectral function @xcite ) can also be considered .",
    "this enanches the strenght at small invariant mass , thus contributing to reduce the energy threshold for the shadowing effect .",
    "the total photoabsorption cross section on c , al , cu , sn and pb has been measured in the energy range 0.5 - 2.6 gev .",
    "the data confirme the absence of structures in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 resonance region and show the damping of the photoabsorption strength above 0.6 gev compared to the free nucleon case .",
    "the new result is the persistence of the strength reduction in the unexplored energy region 1.2 - 1.7 gev , where resonance effects are expected to be small .",
    "in addition , our systematic measurement over a wide range of mass numbers indicates that in this region the strength reduction decreases with the nuclear density .",
    "this reduction can be interpreted as a signature of a low energy onset of the shadowing effect .    in the framework of a vmd description of the shadowing effect both a decrease of the vector meson mass and a significant broadening of the @xmath39-meson spectral function in the nuclear medium , can produce an earlier onset of the shadowing effect . in this respect",
    "the new photoabsorption data provide interesting insigths concerning the modification of the vector meson properties in the nuclear medium .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to the frascati technicians a. orlandi , w. pesci , g.f serafini and a. viticchi for their continuous technical assistance .",
    "we are pleased to thank the elsa staff and the shapir group for the efficiency in running the machine and the tagged photon beam .",
