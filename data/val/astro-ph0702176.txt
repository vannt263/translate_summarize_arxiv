    "[ sec : intro ]    starting in the late 1970 s , with the encouragement of his good friend gerry brown , hans bethe became interested in applying his expertise in nuclear physics to one of the more vexing problems in modern astrophysics - how massive stars die as supernovae .",
    "the problem is difficult for a variety of reasons .",
    "the iron core of a massive star collapses to a neutron star ( or sometimes a black hole ) and , somehow , some fraction of that remnant s binding energy is converted into outwards kinetic energy in the overlying star .",
    "the favored model , now as then , says that the binding energy of the neutron star is radiated as neutrinos , a fraction of which deposit their energy in the matter above the neutron star causing it to expand and explode @xcite .",
    "when hans began to work on the problem , supernova models were not giving explosions .",
    "moreover , the physics was very uncertain with bounce densities ranging from 10@xmath2 g @xmath3 to 10@xmath4 g @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the nuclear equation of state was particularly uncertain .",
    "a major breakthrough was the work by @xcite who showed that the heat capacity of the nuclear bound states was much larger than previously believed @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mean excitation energy was @xmath5 and the partition function associated with all these states was exponentially huge , @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , nuclear equilibrium favored bound nuclei which remained abundant , increasing their average mass , until they touched and merged near nuclear density .",
    "bounce occurred at super - nuclear density on the hard core , repulsive component of the strong force ( not thermal pressure as some calculations claimed ) and was at low entropy .",
    "the general idea of entropy as an important variable in core collapse came from hans , who liked to remark that though the bounce was thermally very hot , in terms of entropy it was as ordered as ice .    during the next 20 years , hans made many other lasting contributions to supernova theory , including the currently favored `` delayed '' neutrino transport paradigm in which convection plays a major role @xcite hans also introduced the ideas of a `` gain radius '' , where neutrino heating first exceeds neutrino losses , and of `` net ram '' , the momentum of the accretion flux that must be overcome to get the shock to move out .",
    "he excelled in simple analytic models for the physics of core collapse , and brought a much needed physically intuitive understanding of a subject that had hitherto been largely numerical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    because of his historical interests in stellar structure and nuclear physics , hans was also interested in the presupernova evolution of massive stars and in nucleosynthesis . during his visits to santa cruz and by mail , we had many discussions on the progenitor of sn 1987a , the physics of supernova light curves , the nature of the `` reverse shock '' , explosive nucleosynthesis , and on the @xmath7-process .",
    "thus it is to his memory that this paper is dedicated .    to this day , we still do nt know exactly how massive stars explode @xcite , so the parameterization of the explosion is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : expl ] .",
    "the key nuclear reaction rates and other uncertain aspects of the presupernova evolution are described in  [ sec : uncertainty ] . in ",
    "[ sec : nucleo ] , our principal nucleosynthetic results are presented , and in  [ sec : fe60 ] , we conclude with a discussion of two key species of interest in @xmath8-line astronomy , @xmath0al and @xmath1fe .    throughout this paper and in the future ,",
    "we employ a unit of energy , the `` bethe '' , abbreviated `` b '' , equal to @xmath9 erg .",
    "gerry brown introduced , and hans and gerry both promoted the use of an alternate term , `` foe '' , frequently found in the supernova literature to stand for 10@xmath10 erg , but in deference to hans contributions to the field , we follow the convention suggested by @xcite .",
    "[ sec : uncertainty ]      [ sec : c12ag ]    the key uncertain reaction rate affecting both the structure of and nucleosynthesis in massive stars remains @xmath11c(@xmath12o , despite over 30 years of painstaking laboratory investigation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the experimental situation was recently reviewed by @xcite , who recommends s(300 kev ) = 102 - 198 kevb with a best value of 145 kevb .",
    "based upon nucleosynthesis considerations , @xcite estimated an s - factor of @xmath13170 kevb , which remains within the experimental range today .",
    "more precisely , weaver and woosley suggested a rate @xmath14 times that of @xcite , which would be 120 - 220 kevb , but even at the time , the error bar was regarded as liberal .",
    "more recently , @xcite has revised the nucleosynthesis constraints using more stellar models , a finer grid of @xmath11c(@xmath12o rates , finer stellar zoning , and other improvements to the stellar model .",
    "their results , shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] , are in good agreement with the earlier calculations of weaver and woosley , but give a narrower error bar and also make the sensitivity of the results to this rate ( variations of only 10% matter ) more apparent . because of the need to include a rate that is accurate across a wide range of temperature , not just during helium burning , the preferred rate is again expressed as a multiple of a published rate fit , this time @xcite , which has s(300 kev ) = 146 kevb .",
    "boyes best fit is about 1.2 times this , or 175 kevb and _ a value of 1.2 times buchmann ( 1996 ) was used in the present study_. this is also consistent with recent measurements reported by @xcite that give a best value of 1.08 times buchmann-1996 ( i.e. , 162 @xmath15 kevb ) .",
    "of course , one could argue that the nucleosynthesis limit is also influenced by our uncertain model of stellar convection @xcite , in which case an experimental value ultimately near 170 kevb would serve to validate the treatment of convection in the code .    during the end of helium burning the @xmath11c(@xmath12o rate competes with the triple - alpha reaction rate , and hence the uncertainty in that rate can have similar effects . in test calculations at @xmath16k and 1000 and 2000 g/@xmath17 we found that a 10% increase in the triple - alpha rate would have the same consequence as an 8% decrease in @xmath11c(@xmath12o . in a star",
    ", convection may change these results , though probably not much .",
    "the @xmath11c(@xmath12o rate would need to be known better than about 10% before the uncertainty in the triple alpha rate , @xmath1312% @xcite , becomes a limiting factor .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    the other uncertain reaction rate that affects the abundances of hosts of nuclei , not just a few , is @xmath18ne(@xmath19n)@xmath20 mg , which , along with @xmath20mg(n,@xmath8)@xmath0 mg , regulates the strength of the @xmath21-process in massive stars .",
    "the rate used here is the recommended value from from @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath18ne(@xmath22 mg competes with @xmath18ne(@xmath19n)@xmath20 mg for the destruction of @xmath18ne and is thus also of some importance for determining the strength of the @xmath21-process .",
    "here we use the lower bound for @xmath18ne(@xmath22 mg estimated by @xcite .",
    "other choices of strong and weak reaction rates have been discussed by @xcite . in particular , except where otherwise noted , we use the hauser - feshbach rates from @xcite for reactions involving n , p , and @xmath23 on heavy nuclei that lack experimental determination .",
    "this is of some relevance to the issue of @xmath0al and @xmath1fe production discussed later in the paper (  [ sec : nuc60 ] ) .",
    "[ sec : mdot ]    mass loss is known to be a powerful determinant in the evolution of stars of nearly solar metallicity , and its omission was one of the major shortcomings of the woosley - weaver 1995 survey @xcite . for stars more massive than about 35 , mass",
    "loss is particularly important since it not only removes the hydrogen envelope , but shrinks the helium core appreciably . with current estimates of mass loss",
    ", a 100  population i star ends its life as a star of only about 6 , composed of helium and heavier elements only and no hydrogen left .",
    "this is similar to the mass and composition of the core of a 20  star , and the explosion properties , remnant mass , and nucleosynthesis are radically different from a 100  star that had no mass loss ( see  [ sec : remnants ] ) .",
    "the mass loss prescription used here has also been discussed by @xcite . in particular",
    ", we use @xcite for mass loss on the main sequence and for red giants and @xcite for wolf - rayet stars the latter is based on the mass loss rate by @xcite fit to observational data and divided by a factor of three to account for clumping @xcite . the nucleosynthesis products carried away by stellar wind",
    "are included in all yields reported in this paper .",
    "[ sec : conv ]    the treatment of convective physics , including overshoot mixing and semiconvection , follows the discussion in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use a semi - convective mixing parameter , @xmath23 = 0.1 , which results in relatively fast mixing in semiconvective regions . mixing was treated in a time - dependent , mixing length formalism using the ledoux criterion for instability .",
    "the fast semiconvection contributes significantly to mixing in regions that are stable to the ledoux criterion but unstable to the schwarzschild criterion , however , the mixing is less than that of a mere schwarzschild mixing , taking into account the stabilizing effects of composition gradients .",
    "rotation can have a significant effect on both the presupernova evolution and the explosion mechanism . here",
    "rotation was neglected , which is to say it is assumed that the change in helium core mass and dredge up of light isotopes due to rotationally induced mixing are small , for moderately fast rotating stars , and that the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity during the explosion is negligible .",
    "all these assumptions are questionable for rapidly rotating stars , especially so in small fraction of massive stars that become gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "[ sec : solabn ]    the evolution and nucleosynthesis of a massive star both are sensitive to its initial composition .",
    "the total abundance of cno affects the efficiency of hydrogen burning and the opacity .",
    "the conversion of cno into @xmath18ne during helium burning determines the `` neutron excess '' , which affects the production of all nuclei with unequal neutron and proton numbers .",
    "@xmath18ne also provides the free neutrons necessary for the @xmath21-process during helium burning . finally , because the yields of supernovae are traditionally normalized to @xmath24o , any change in the solar oxygen abundance affects the comparative ease with which all other heavy elements are produced .",
    "it is thus a major occurrence in nucleosynthesis theory when the solar abundances , traditionally taken as representative of population i stars in our galaxy , are modified .",
    "recent revisions to the solar abundance set have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the abundances of all isotopes of cno have been reduced by amounts of order 30% compared with the standard anders and grevesse values @xcite of a few years ago . here",
    "we use the @xcite set both as a starting composition , and also to normalize all computed yields .",
    "[ sec : presn ]    using the kepler implicit hydrodynamics code @xcite and the physics specified above and in @xcite , stars of solar composition and various masses were evolved to the presupernova stage - defined by a collapse velocity in the core of 1000 kms@xmath25 .",
    "masses included in the study were 12 through 33 solar masses in steps of 1 , plus stars of 35 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 55 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 100 , and 120  - 32 stars altogether .",
    "a future survey will use a much finer grid of masses , and the present work may be regarded as a preliminary survey .",
    "[ sec : expl ]    as alluded to in the introduction , a robust description for how massive stars explode as supernovae remains elusive and this must surely affect our understanding of the origin of the elements .",
    "it is worth separating out that part of the nucleosynthesis that depends on the explosion mechanism from that which does not , however .",
    "certainly isotopes produced in the vicinity of what is commonly known as `` the mass cut '' are sensitive to conditions set up by the passage of the shock .",
    "this includes the yields of species made by explosive oxygen and silicon burning and in nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "more quantitatively , these are the species made at temperatures above @xmath26 k and at radii less than about 7000 km , i.e. , roughly the inner 1 to 2 solar masses of ejecta .",
    "other species made by hydrogen , helium , carbon , neon and oxygen burning in hydrostatic equilibrium are not greatly affected ( provided such material escapes the star and does not fall into a black hole ) , nor is the nucleosynthesis in the pre - explosive wind . on the other hand , the @xmath7-process and other species made in the neutrino - powered wind _",
    "are _ quite sensitive to the explosion mechanism , and it is this sensitivity that makes them excellent diagnostics of the event .    as we shall see though ,",
    "even the `` explosive nucleosynthesis '' below atomic mass 100 is not particularly sensitive to details of the explosion , provided that the star blows up with a `` reasonable '' kinetic energy and the explosion is not grossly asymmetric .",
    "this is basically because the shock conditions are determined by the pre - explosive structure and some simple physics , @xmath27 = explosion energy @xmath28 1 b.    here , as elsewhere , the explosion is parameterized by a piston at constant lagrangian mass coordinate that moves through the star with some specified radial history @xcite .",
    "the essential parameters of the piston are its location in mass and the final kinetic energy it imparts to the ejecta at infinity .",
    "two different choices of each are explored : a ) piston mass at the edge of the iron core or at the point where the dimensionless entropy @xmath29 = 4.0 ; and b ) kinetic energies of 1.2 and 2.4 b. thus for each mass , 4 explosion models were calculated for a total of 128 supernovae simulated .",
    "-1.0 in    -0.5 in    [ fig : fig2 ]    the choices of piston mass and explosion energy are not free parameters , but are highly constrained by observations .",
    "the piston mass can not be smaller than the iron core mass or unacceptable overproductions of @xmath30fe and other neutron - rich species in the iron group will occur .",
    "on the other hand it can not be much larger than the base of the oxygen shell ( @xmath31 = 4 ) or , as we shall see , typical neutron star masses will be too large .",
    "the large density decrease associated with the base of the oxygen shell is also dynamically important and successful explosion calculations , when they occur , frequently find the mass cut there .",
    "the explosion energy is constrained to be 1 - 2 b by observations of sn 1987a @xcite which was a type ii supernova of typical mass ( about 18 - 20 ) .",
    "it is also constrained by the observed light curves of type ii supernovae .",
    "[ sec : remnants ]    observations by @xcite of a large number of pulsars in binary systems give a narrow spread in masses , @xmath32 .",
    "there must be room for some diversity , however .",
    "@xcite present compelling evidence for a pulsar in the terzian 5 globular cluster with a gravitational mass of 1.68 .",
    "the remnant gravitational masses for our survey using the kepler stellar evolution code , with ke = 1.2 b and pistons located the edge of the iron core , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . a more careful analysis of fall back in these models using an eulerian hydrodynamics code and",
    "a better treatment of the inner boundry conditions has been carried out by @xcite , but gives similar numbers for solar metallicity stars . using the @xcite values , adopting a salpeter initial mass function with @xmath33 to describe the birth frequency of these stars , and assuming a maximum neutron star mass of 2.0 , one obtains an average _ gravitational mass _ for the neutron star of @xmath34 if the piston is at the @xmath31 = 4.0 point and @xmath35 if it is at the edge of the iron core .",
    "if the maximum neutron star mass is 1.7 , the numbers are changed to @xmath36  and @xmath37 respectively . in this paper",
    ", we carried out simulations with the piston at both points - the iron core edge , and the base of the oxygen shell .",
    "larger masses than typical are also possible for the rare exceptionally massive star , usually those over 25 . for those cases where a black hole was made ,",
    "its average mass was around 3 .",
    "we note that these numbers are for single stars and they could be altered significantly in mass exchanging binaries .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ]    the figure also shows that neutron stars are made by both the lightest main sequence stars and the heaviest .",
    "this is a consequence of mass loss .",
    "the helium core mass of the presupernova star increases monotonically with main sequence mass up to about 45 , where it reaches a maximum of 13 . beyond that the helium core shrinks due to efficient wolf - rayet mass loss and the iron core mass shrinks with it .",
    "a 100  model had a total mass of only 6.04  when it died - all helium and heavy elements - and an iron core mass of 1.54 .",
    "the results are quite different for stars with low metallicity and , hence , reduced mass loss @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows that the remnant mass increases rapidly for main sequence masses above about 35  and continues to increase at higher masses .",
    "these large masses are due to fall back .",
    "a 1.2 b explosion is inadequate to unbind the entire star , especially given the large helium core @xcite and effect of the reverse shock .",
    "a 100  main sequence star now dies with a helium core of 42 , well into the pulsational pair instability domain @xcite .",
    "unless supernova engines of much greater power than 1.2 b become available at low metallicity , these stars will make black holes , not neutron stars , and if the rotation rate is sufficient , gamma - ray bursts .    one may also note the existence of two branches of black hole remnants above 35  in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "@xcite find that these branches correspond to two different classes of progenitors - red supergiants , which experience a lot less fall back during the reverse shock @xcite - and more compact , extremely blue supergiants .",
    "if the star produces primary nitrogen due to the interpenetration of the helium convective core and hydrogen envelope , it swells to red giant proportions , has a weaker reverse shock , and leaves a smaller remnant mass .",
    "[ sec : light ]    the kepler code includes radiative diffusion and can thus be used to calculate approximate light curves for the supernovae it produces .",
    "the code is limited by using a single temperature for the radiation and the matter , and assumes blackbody radiation , but these are not bad approximations during the plateau stage of type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "the principal opacity source is electron scattering with the free electron abundance determined by solving the saha abundances of all ions for the 19 isotopes in the reaction network @xcite .",
    "a floor opacity of 10@xmath38 @xmath39 g@xmath25 is used in regions that have recombined .",
    "the abundance of @xmath40ni is taken from the nucleosynthesis calculation and moderate mixing of the helium core is assumed .",
    "the resulting light curves for four explosions of a 15 supernova are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] for cases where the mass cut was taken at the edge of the iron core and at the location where the entropy equals 4@xmath41/baryon .",
    "two explosion energies , 1.2 b and 2.4 b were employed .",
    "the explosions that had the higher kinetic energy were brighter on the plateau and the ones with the deeper mass cut ( and hence more @xmath40ni ejected ) had the brighter tails .",
    "the mass of @xmath40ni ejected was 0.086  for the 1.2 b explosion with the mass cut at s = 4@xmath41/baryon ; 0.096 for the 2.4 b explosion with mass cut at s = 4@xmath41/baryon ; 0.27  for the 1.2 b explosion with the mass cut at the edge of the iron core ; and 0.31  for the 2.4 b explosion with the mass cut at the edge of the iron core .    clearly , the models with higher kinetic energy are brighter on the plateau ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , if the kinetic energy were any larger than 2.4 b , the supernova would be far brighter than average type iip supernovae . on the other hand",
    "if the explosion energy were much less than 1 b , large amounts of material would fall back , increasing the masses of the neutron star remnants beyond acceptable values and robbing the nucleosynthesis of its most prolific sources .",
    "we conclude that the range 1.2 - 2.4 b is the relevant one for modern supernovae in solar metallicity stars and these are the values employed in the nucleosynthesis survey .",

    "[ sec : nucleo ]    the integrated yields of the elements are given for four different choices of mass cut and explosion energy in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] . whether one places the piston at the edge of the iron core or the base of the oxygen shell and whether the explosion energy is 1.2 b or 2.4 b makes little difference except to the iron group .",
    "there the difference is of order a factor of two , with lower iron yields obviously resulting from lower explosion energies and shallower pistons . in all cases",
    "the iron group synthesis is low compared both with c , o , ne , and na and with @xmath21-process production above ni .",
    "one expects from one - half to two - thirds of the iron group to come from type ia supernovae @xcite which are not included here .",
    "the @xmath21-process , which is secondary in nature , will be underproduced in stars of less than solar metallicity , so a factor of two extra here relative to oxygen is not undesirable .",

    "overall , the agreement is quite good , especially considering that several known sites of important nucleosynthesis have been omitted .",

    "the overabundance of @xmath47k is not a concern since some will decay before the sun is born . also missing are ordinary type ia supernovae , which contribute half or more of the iron group , and asymptotic giant branch stars which make @xmath48n and the @xmath21-process .",
    "in fact , the full production of carbon here is a novel and surprising result , since it is usually attributed to low mass stars .",
    "it is made here chiefly in the winds of very massive wolf - rayet stars and its production is facilitated by the new lower solar abundance @xcite .",

    "[ sec : nuc60 ]    one problem is certainly the use of uncertain nuclear reaction rates in all studies to date . in making the transition to the reaction rate data base of @xcite",
    ", we erroneously used the new hauser feshbach rates especially for @xmath0al(n , p)@xmath0 mg and @xmath0al(n,@xmath23)@xmath51na .",

    "a second effect , less important than the cross sections , is a super - hot helium shell ( @xmath55 k ) in several of the pre - supernova star .",
    "this shells existence was traced to the use of opal opacities in a region where they may not be appropriate , a region where electron scattering dominates . using the electron scattering opacity of @xcite just in high temperature regions where electron scattering dominates",
    "decreased the @xmath1fe yield significantly , but this was only in a few stars .    using what we believe to be more nearly correct cross sections for @xmath0al destruction ( though still uncertain ) and adjusting the opacity as described ,",
    "the integrated yield of @xmath1fe to @xmath0al is reduced to 0.95 .",
    "this is for a standard salpeter imf with @xmath42 = -1.35 .",
    "if we instead change the slope to -0.90 , i.e. , enhance the production of very massive stars , the ratio is reduced slightly to 0.81 .",
    "even then one - half the yield of @xmath0al comes from stars under 35 , not the more massive ones and their wolf - rayet winds .",
    "there are further uncertainties to explore , however .",
    "several of the cross sections governing the production of @xmath1fe are also highly uncertain .",
    "the reaction @xmath56fe(n,@xmath8)@xmath1fe affects its synthesis and @xmath1fe(n,@xmath8)@xmath57fe controls its destruction .",
    "neither is measured , though both could be , admittedly with difficulty .",
    "interestingly , both changed in the @xcite tabulation in such a direction as to increase @xmath1fe production .",
    "the tabulation by @xcite had , for helium burning temperatures , a rate for @xmath56fe(n,@xmath8)@xmath1fe half as large and a rate for @xmath1fe(n,@xmath8)@xmath57fe twice as large . when the older rates were used for a select set of models , the @xmath1fe production was reduced by about a factor of two .",
    "the final _ nuclear _ uncertainty is the rate governing the production of neutrons where @xmath1fe is made , i.e. , @xmath18ne(@xmath23,n)@xmath20 mg . the rate included in our network @xcite is increased from what was used in 1995 . if we reduce its value in a few select models by a factor of two ( within the error bar ) , @xmath1fe production is again decreased by up to a factor of two , though usually the effect was smaller .",
    "all things considered , variation of only the nuclear physics , bringing uncertain cross sections back to the values they had in the timmes et al survey , could account for most of the difference in the present calculations and the observations .",
    "_ hence further progress in this important field of astronomy depends upon more accurate measurements and estimates of critical nuclear physics .",
    "_      this is not to say that non - nuclear effects are unimportant .",
    "metallicity , mass loss , rotation , and an uncertain imf certainly all play major roles .",

    "an explicit comparison with a couple of our models is educational . for a 60  main sequence star with z = 0.02 and no rotation",
    ", they find an @xmath0al production _ in the pre - explosive wind of the star _ of @xmath58 and a final star mass of 12.4  @xcite . for our 60  model with metallicity z = 0.016 and using the smaller experimental rates for @xmath0al(n , p)@xmath0 mg and @xmath0al(n,@xmath59na , we find a production in the wind of @xmath60  and a final mass of 8.0 .",
    "but we also find an additional @xmath61  of @xmath0al is produced _ in the explosion _ of the remaining star , chiefly by explosive neon burning .",
    "this is good agreement , and shows that the explosion and wind may contribute comparable amounts to @xmath0al synthesis even for a 60  progenitor .",
    "@xcite further explore the dependence of metallicity and rotation though , and find @xmath0al production in the wind of this same star is increased to @xmath62  if the rotation rate is 300 km s@xmath25 on the main sequence , or @xmath63  with no rotation but z = 0.04 . combining both effects , z = 0.04 _ and",
    "_ @xmath64 = 300 km s@xmath25 , the @xmath0al production in the wind becomes even larger @xmath65 .",
    "while one must be concerned that increasing the metallicity may also increase the @xmath1fe yield and thus not increase the @xmath1fe/@xmath0al ratio @xcite , this does show the sensitivity of @xmath0al to reasonable variations in rotation rate .",
    "for a 120  model , the effect is even greater is similar . for z = 0 , @xmath64 = 0 ,",
    "@xcite obtain an @xmath0al mass of @xmath66  in the wind while we have @xmath67  plus @xmath68  made in the explosion . with z = 0.04 and @xmath69 = 300 km s@xmath25 ,",
    "@xcite get a whopping @xmath70 .    @xcite",
    "have also recently ( after our present study was completed ) examined the sensitivity of @xmath1fe and @xmath0al production to the prescription for mass loss and the slope of the imf .",
    "they find that both can make an appreciable difference .",
    "[ sec : concl ]    we still do nt understand exactly how massive stars explode , far less the variation of explosion properties - especially mass cut and explosive kinetic energy - with main sequence mass .",
    "this remains a forefront problem in nuclear astrophysics research to which hans bethe contributed greatly .",
    "it is likely , in the final analysis , that the physical intuition , terminology , and convective , neutrino - powered paradigm that he and his colleagues brought to the field will form the basis of a complete understanding , though we are nt there yet @xcite .",
    "certainly , the low entropy , super - nuclear density bounce following the initial collapse will be phase one of any massive star explosion .",
    "this lack of a first principles understanding of the explosion mechanism , however , is not a fundamental roadblock on our path to understanding the origin of ( almost all of ) the elements .",
    "arguments have been presented here to show that the mass cut is highly constrained by nucleosynthesis and observed neutron star masses .",
    "the explosion energy in common type ii supernovae is also mostly in the range 1.2 b plus or minus a factor of two .",
    "exploding a large range of stellar masses with pistons located either at the edge of the iron core or the base of the oxygen burning shell - the maximum range allowed - and with explosion energies of either 1.2 b or 2.4 b gives very similar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the iron group is most affected and the magnitude of the uncertainty is about a factor of two .",
    "the nucleosynthesis that results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) agrees reasonably well with solar abundances .",
    "there are some changes caused by the recent downward revisions of the solar cno abundances , and at first glance the agreement is worsened by these changes . since @xmath24o is our standard normalization point in nucleosynthesis studies , since we now need to make less of it , the production of all other heavier elements is decreased .",
    "yields that previously would have coproduced si and o say , in solar proportions , now overproduce o ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) . the production of odd - z elements and odd - a isotopes is also decreased because the initial cno in the star later becomes the @xmath18ne that sets the neutron excess for carbon , neon , and oxygen burning (  [ sec : solabn ] ) .",
    "still the agreement is not too bad , and most of the missing species @xmath2c , @xmath71n , @xmath46ca , etc .",
    "can be attributed to other sites than massive stars .",
    "the outstanding problem in nucleosynthesis theory presently is a full understanding of the @xmath7- and @xmath72processes .",
    "the latter has an appreciable contribution from explosive neon and oxygen burning ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) for a greater than 130 , but is underproduced for lighter masses .",
    "the solution for both the @xmath7-process and the light @xmath49-process probably lies in the neutrino - powered wind .",
    "current models give inadequate entropy in the wind and this may be where nucleosynthesis can be an important diagnostic of the explosion model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the nucleosynthesis of the long - lived radioactivities @xmath0al and @xmath1fe is an important constraint on the stellar models , and one that is largely independent of the explosion mechanism .",
    "the abundances inferred from gamma - ray line astronomy may have important implications for rotationally induced mixing , convection theory , mass loss theory , the initial mass function for massive stars , and the distribution of metals in the galaxy .",
    "the synthesis is also quite sensitive to nuclear reaction rates whose uncertain values could be better determined in the laboratory , however . in particular , the discrepancy between observations of the @xmath1fe/@xmath0al ratio and recent calculations - this work and @xcite - may involve a `` perfect nuclear storm '' of erroneous choices .",
    "the rates affecting @xmath0al destruction were almost certainly too high ; the rates affecting @xmath1fe production , namely @xmath56fe(n,@xmath8)@xmath1fe and @xmath18ne(@xmath23,n)@xmath20 mg , may have been too high ; and the rate for its destruction , @xmath1fe(n,@xmath8)@xmath57fe may have been too low . given the choices made by @xcite , the prediction of @xcite , which agrees with observations , is still defensible . in any case ,",
    "important inferences about the stellar models will only be credible ( and necessary ) , when these uncertain rates have been better determined .",
