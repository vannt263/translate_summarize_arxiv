    "perfect crystal neutron interferometry was first demonstrated in 1974 at the @xmath3kw triga mark - ii reactor in vienna @xcite .",
    "ever since neutron optical experiments , based on interference of matter waves , have provided a power full means of demonstrating effects related to fundamental aspects of quantum physics @xcite , such as measuring the @xmath4-periodicity of fermions @xcite , gravitational effects on the neutron @xcite , spin superposition @xcite and topological phases @xcite .",
    "entanglement between different degrees of freedom like the neutron s spin , energy and path have been accomplished @xcite and used for testing bell s inequality @xcite or measuring the influence of geometric phases @xcite .",
    "such entanglement is achieved within single particles .",
    "further demonstrations of the contextual nature of quantum mechanics ( qm ) have been performed successfully using neutron interferometry @xcite .",
    "the violation of the bell inequality can only be shown with high interference contrast and high spin polarisation . in the first experiment @xcite",
    "a mu - metal sheet was used as a spin turner , which induced dephasing due to small angle scattering and thereby reduced the interference contrast . the next setup",
    "@xcite solved the problem of dephasing but the degree of polarisation became problematic .    in this paper we report a significantly improved experimental setup .",
    "we designed new dc spin - turners and larmor - accelerators which allow for very high contrast of the interference fringes and high temperature stability during long measurements .",
    "they also enable high degrees of polarisation and high efficiency spin manipulation .",
    "this setup allows a large variety of state preparations and therefore provides capability for many future experiments @xcite .",
    "we performed a test of bell s inequality using this new setup .",
    "the results reveal the substantial improvements achieved by the newly designed setup .",
    "in our setup high degrees of polarisation , thermal stability , efficient spin - manipulation and spin - analysis are required .",
    "former setups had drawbacks that degrade the quality of the measurement results .",
    "these setups used conventional dc spin - turners or rf - flippers inside the ifm .",
    "such setups were used for spin - superposition , geometric phase and entanglement measurements @xcite . for earlier bell - measurement using single - neutron interferometry two different setups",
    "were realized @xcite . in both setups",
    "the spin manipulation in the interferometer ( ifm ) was problematic : the contrast and the degree of polarisation were reduced .",
    "these two setups are shown in figure [ fig : old_setup ] .",
    "scheme [ fig : old_setup]a ) shows the ifm with inserted soft magnetic mu - metal foil as a spin turner .",
    "this is achieved by a magnetic field induced into the mu - metal by a dc - coil outside of the ifm .",
    "the mu - metal foil considerably reduced the contrast of the ifm due to dephasing . to overcome this problem another setup",
    "was designed , which does not need any material in the neutron beam in the ifm @xcite , shown in figure [ fig : old_setup]b ) . in one path of the ifm",
    "the beam passes a tube of mu - metal which reduces the strength of the magnetic guide field and thereby induces a relative spin rotation by different larmor precession in the two ifm paths . since the guide field leaks into the cylinder at its open ends , the field homogeneity is compromised which causes depolarisation of the neutron beam",
    "this setup also requires a spin turner in front of the ifm which additionally reduces the degree of polarisation as described below .    a schematic view of the new setup is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the beam is monochromatised to have a mean wave length of @xmath5  by a silicon channel - cut perfect - crystal monochromator .",
    "the incoming neutron beam is polarized by two birefringent magnetic prisms which deflect beams of up- and down - spin neutrons in different directions .",
    "the angle between these two beams is @xmath6 rad .",
    "since the acceptance width of the interferometer crystal for laue diffraction is even smaller , we can select one of the spin components ( spin - up ) by adjusting the rotation angle of the ifm accordingly .",
    "neutrons with spin - down pass the ifm without being reflected and are blocked by a beam stopper afterwards . to avoid depolarisation of the beam a guide field is applied over the entire setup . in front of the ifm",
    "the spin is rotated by a dc spin - turner into the xy - plane . within this plane we can adjust the spin by utilizing larmor precession without putting any material into the beam .",
    "this is important to avoid loss of interference contrast due to dephasing .",
    "a sapphire phase shifter of @xmath7 mm thickness between second and third plate of the ifm tunes the relative phase @xmath8 between the beams in path i and path ii . behind the ifm",
    "the spin analysis is carried out using a dc - coil on a translation stage together with a co - ti super - mirror array .",
    "the neutrons are detected in @xmath9he counters with more than 99% efficiency @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-spin rotator is placed between the magnetic prisms and the ifm .",
    "due to the small separation of spin - up- and spin - down -beam by the magnetic prisms and the fact that the selection of the peak takes place at the first plate of the ifm , wider peaks of the imf s rocking curves degrade the degree of polarization of the neutron beam .",
    "the peak width at the first ifm plate is determined by the monochromator and the properties of the @xmath11-spin rotator regarding small - angle scattering .",
    "in contrast to earlier experiments where a single reflecting monochromator was used , we used a three - fold channel - cut monochromator .",
    "a comparison of rocking curves by using one- and three - fold reflection is shown in figure [ fig : crystal ] .",
    "the full width at half maximum @xmath12 ( fwhm ) of the rocking peak of the single reflecting crystal has a fwhm@xmath13 rad , whereas the triple reflecting crystal has a fwhm@xmath14 rad : the former is 70% wider than the triple reflecting crystal .    .rocking curve comparison with spin turning coils made of different materials , normalised to the empty setup .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : coilcompaire ]    the peak broadening was measured for different coils made of copper ribbon ( @xmath15mm@xmath16 and @xmath17mm@xmath16 in profile ) , aluminium ribbon ( @xmath18mm@xmath16 in profile ) , and aluminium wire ( 0.5 mm in diameter ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dc_coils ] the aluminium ribbon coil and the copper ribbon coil are shown next to an empty coil frame .",
    "figure [ fig : peakcomp ] shows the rocking curves for different coils in comparison to the empty . in table [ tab : coilcompaire ] the peak height and the width of the rocking curves for different coils are given in respect to the empty beam line .",
    "one can see that despite the small absorption and scattering cross - section of aluminium , the wire coil enlarges the width of peak and lowers the peak intensity because of small - angular scattering , whereas within the error there is no evident difference between the three ribbon coils .",
    "the rectangular profiled ribbons do not produce significant small - angle scattering and therefore more neutrons fulfill bragg s law . for our measurements we used @xmath19 mm wide copper ribbon for both dc spin - turners . in figure",
    "[ fig : double_peak ] one can see the separation of the up - spin peak and the down - spin peak with the @xmath11-spin rotator in the beam line . between the two main peaks",
    "one can see a small peak produced by neutrons that fulfil higher orders of the bragg condition .",
    "applying the two - flipper method by tuning two spin rotators before and after the ifm the degree of polarisation was measured to be @xmath20 , @xmath21 for the efficiency of the first coil and @xmath21 for the efficiency of the second coil .",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath11-spin rotators is reduced by the stray fields of the magnetic prisms in front of the ifm and of the super - mirror spin analyser behind it respectively .",
    "therefore the coils were placed as far from super mirror and magnetic prisms as possible .",
    "the state preparation requires two larmor accelerator coils placed in the ifm as shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "these coils in helmholtz geometry apply an additional parallel or anti - parallel field to the guide field in z - direction locally and thereby change the spin precession in the xy - plane . since the rotation angle is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the magnetic moment of the neutron",
    ", @xmath24 is the length of the coils and @xmath25 is the velocity of the neutrons , a magnetic field of about @xmath26 mt is required for a spin rotation of @xmath10 . for the fabricated coil a current of about @xmath27a",
    "is required for a spin rotation of @xmath10 .",
    "since the coils produce heat and due to the high sensitivity of the ifm to thermal influences , the coils need to be cooled down .",
    "to obtain constant temperature up to @xmath28@xmath29c the coils are placed in small boxes which are completely flooded with temperature controlled water .",
    "the coil wire is in direct contact with the water , insulated only by lacquer .",
    "the boxes are made of acrylic glass , which is a thermal and electrical insulator .",
    "length , width and height of the boxes amount to 22 , 26 and 26 mm respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : fotos_box]a ) shows a schematic view of a box .",
    "the boxes have a straight passage for the neutron beam ( green arrows ) , so that the beam does nt pass any material and therefore no dephasing occurs .",
    "the figure also shows the magnetic field in z - direction ( red arrow ) applied by the coils in helmholtz configuration ( yellow ) .",
    "the flux of the cooling water is depicted by blue arrows .",

    "the mountings for beam stoppers between second and third plate of the ifm are depicted .",
    "the beam stoppers are used to calibrate the larmor accelerators one at a time by blocking the other path respectively .",
    "the beam stoppers used here are @xmath30 mm thick cadmium plates .",
    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) is one of the most successful physical theories and its predictions have been proven accurately in many experiments using various kinds of systems .",
    "einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite argued that qm is not a complete theory since it only gives probabilistic predictions and that there must be an underlying deterministic theory to qm . in 1964 bell",
    "@xcite showed that local hidden variable theories satisfy some inequalities that are violated by qm . shortly after bell",
    "published his well known paper clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( cshs ) reformulated bell s inequalities suitable for the first experimental test of quantum non - locality @xcite . in the case of neutrons",
    "not two particles are entangled but two different degrees of freedom within one particle @xcite . non contextual hidden variables theories ( nchvt )",
    "states that the outcome of a measurement is independent of previous or simultaneous measurements on any set of commuting observables .      in our single neutron interferometer",
    "we entangle two different degrees of freedom ( spatial and spin ) of a single neutron @xcite .",
    "the neutron is described by a tensor product hilbert space @xmath31 , where @xmath32 corresponds to the spatial wave function and @xmath33 to the spinor wave function . since observables of the spacial part commute with those of the spinor part",
    "one can derive a bell - like state .",
    "the normalized wave function is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to up- and down - spin and @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the two paths in the ifm .",
    "the expectation value of the joint spin and path measurement can be written as @xmath39 \\times [ \\hat{p}^p _ { \\chi ; 1 } - \\hat{p}^p _ { \\chi ; -1 } ] \\ket \\psi.\\ ] ] the observables for spin @xmath40 and path @xmath41 can be decomposed by projection operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which project onto orthogonal spin states @xmath44 and orthogonal path states @xmath45 , respectively . the expectation value given in equation [ eq : expdeff ] and",
    "the projection operators correspond to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the conventional epr argument @xcite . in the experiment",
    "the parameter @xmath49 can be varied by polarisation measurement of the bell - like state , @xmath8 is tuned by an auxiliary phase shifter .",
    "for single - neutron interferometry a bell - like inequality can be expressed using the expectation values @xmath50 as @xmath51 , with @xmath52 in our experiment the expectation values @xmath53 are determined by a combination of count rates @xmath54 of a single detector donated to appropriated settings of @xmath49 and @xmath8 .",
    "this gives : @xmath55 the count rates @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 $ ] according to quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "this leads to a sinusoidal behaviour of the expectation values @xmath58 .",
    "bell s inequality are violated for various set of polarisation analysis @xmath59 and phase shifts @xmath60 , but the largest violation is expected for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which gives the value @xmath65 . by measuring @xmath66 one can test whether or not nchvts can describe nature correctly .      for optimization of a measurement every part of the setup should be adjusted in a systematic way .",
    "first of all the point of highest interference contrast on the ifm , i.e. the sweet spot is looked for .",
    "the interferometer crystal is mapped by moving an aperture vertically and horizontally in the xz - plane in front of the ifm and measuring the contrast on each position .",
    "the result of such a raster scan is shown in figure [ fig : rasterscan ] .",
    "this scan is performed with a beam cross - section of @xmath67mm@xmath16 and a step increment of @xmath30 mm .",
    "one can see that only a small part of the ifm provides highest contrast , which reaches at @xmath68 .",
    "the contrast of the ifm is very sensitive to temperature fluctuations .",
    "even temperature changes by @xmath28@xmath69c destroy the interference pattern . since the guide field and",
    "the larmor - accelerators produce heat , both elements are water cooled .",
    "this is done by two temperature stabilized water pumps . to optimize the temperature of the cooling water for the guide field and the boxes ,",
    "temperature scans are performed . in figure",
    "[ fig : cvst ] the contrast of the ifm is plotted for different temperatures of the cooling water in the boxes . for @xmath70@xmath71c an average contrast of @xmath72",

    "after stabilisation contrast up to @xmath73 can be observed as seen in figure [ fig : high_contrast ] . when the temperature is raised up to @xmath74@xmath75c the contrast drops to @xmath76 .",
    "a raise by @xmath30@xmath75c in temperature results in a decrease in contrast of @xmath77 .",
    "thermal stability is important for another crucial point , since not only loss in contrast but also considerable phase drifts occur . a temperature change of @xmath30@xmath75c in the boxes results in @xmath78rad phase shift .",
    "figure [ fig : phase_vs_t ] shows this situation .",
    "the large error bars at high temperatures arises from the low contrast obtained at this temperatures as seen in figure [ fig : cvst ] .",
    "both the loss in contrast as well as the phase shift resulting from thermal instability degrade the quality of measurement results . to increase the stability of the setup the ifm and the larmor accelerators",
    "are placed in a box to avoid air convection and therefore temperature fluctuations over long periods of time .    to determine the expectation values @xmath53 occurring in the bell - inequalities four spin - directions @xmath61 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and four phase - shifts @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85",
