    "in recent years , a new direction of research in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) has developed , in which multiple cavities that are coupled via the exchange of photons are considered .",
    "such setups are particularly intriguing if the cavities are connected to form regular arrays and if the strong coupling regime is achieved in each cavity of the array .",
    "such devices would give rise to novel structures where coherent light matter interactions exceed dissipative processes simultaneously in multiple locations of the array @xcite .    whereas it is rather challenging to build mutually resonant high finesse cavities in the optical regime , it is for microwave photons perfectly feasible to engineer large arrays of mutually resonant cavities on one chip in an architecture known as circuit - qed  @xcite . here",
    "multiple superconducting transmission line resonators with virtually identical lengths in the centimeter range can be coupled via capacitors or inductive links @xcite .",
    "the individual transmission line resonators can feature strong optical nonlinearities by coupling them to superconducting qubits such as transmons @xcite or phase qubits @xcite .    yet in all experiments that involve light - matter interactions , some photons will inevitably be lost from the structure due to imperfect light confinement or emitter relaxation . to compensate for such losses ,",
    "cavity arrays are thus most naturally studied in a regime where an input drive continuously replaces the dissipated excitations .",
    "this mode of operation eventually gives rise to a driven dissipative regime , where the dynamical balance of loading and loss processes leads to the emergence of stationary states @xcite .",
    "the properties of these stationary states may however vary significantly if one changes system parameters such as the photon tunneling rate between cavities , the light - matter interaction in a cavity or even the relative phase between a pair of coherent input drives @xcite .    a device that is ideally suited for studying the effect of relative phases between input drives",
    "is the so called quantum optical josephson interferometer @xcite , which consists of two coherently driven linear cavities connected through a central cavity with a single - photon nonlinearity . here",
    ", the interplay between tunneling and interactions in the steady state of the system has been analyzed for regimes of weak input drives where the number of excitations in each cavity is rather small by gerace et al .",
    "for opposite phases of the input drives one finds a destructive interference which suppresses population of the central cavity , whereas for input drives in phase the central cavity is populated with anti - bunched excitations due to its strong nonlinearity .",
    "for the considered regime of low excitation numbers the approach @xcite employed a full numerical analysis relying on an excitation number truncation of the hilbert spaces .",
    "for high input drives however , the theoretical description of the system poses a challenge as conventional numerical methods quickly become computationally infeasible .",
    "hence , such a numerical approach can not describe regimes with more intense input drives where excitation numbers begin to grow and is therefore unable to explore a possible transition from a quantum regime with anti - bunched output photons to a classical regime with uncorrelated output photons .    here",
    "we present approaches that are capable of describing this transition . for a parameter regime with a weak nonlinearity in the central resonator",
    "we expand the intra cavity fields to linear order in the quantum fluctuations around their coherent parts .",
    "this bogoliubov - type expansion provides a good approximation provided the density of quantum fluctuations around the coherent background is small compared to the excitation number in the latter .",
    "this regime is realized for weak nonlinearities in the central resonator .    in turn for strong nonlinearities but moderate photon tunneling rates between the resonators",
    "we combine an exact solution for a driven kerr nonlinearity by drummond and walls @xcite with a mean - field decoupling of the photon tunneling between resonators . as the solution",
    "is based on a description of the quantum state in terms of a p - function we will refer to it as p - function mean - field @xcite . we find that this approach provides an accurate description in a large parameter range provided the photon tunneling is low enough such that the fields in the outer resonators do not deviate significantly from coherent ones .",
    "an overview of the discussed approaches and the parameter regimes where they provide an accurate description is sketched in figure [ regions ] .",
    ", the validity range of the numerical approach shrinks to larger nonlinearities whereas the validity ranges for the bogoliubov and p - function mean - field approaches grow . for definitions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 see equation ( [ hsys ] ) .",

    "each transmission line resonator has an individual dissipation - rate , which depends on the resonator s coupling capacitors at both ends .",

    "it is important to note that the nonlinearity of a transmon qubit is attractive ( corresponding to @xmath11 in our notation ) .",
    "the circuit qed josephson interferometer is an open quantum system due to experimental imperfections such as the finite reflectivity of the coupling capacitors at each end of the transmission line resonators and relaxation of the transmon .",
    "we consider here the case where excitations in all three transmission line resonators have the same dissipation rates . as excitations in the second resonator",
    "can also decay via transmon relaxation , equal dissipation rates can be achieved for example by choosing suitable capacitances at the ends of the transmission lines . since the couplings to the environments are sufficiently small @xcite we can make use of the master equation approach @xcite . as a simplification",
    "we assume the reservoir state to be in vacuum , which is justified by the fact that circuit qed experiments are typically performed at a temperature in the millikelvin range @xcite .",
    "these considerations lead to the master equation @xmath12 where the liouvillian @xmath13 is given by @xmath14+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\sum^3_{k=1}\\left(2\\hat{a}_k\\rho\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_k-\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_k\\hat{a}_k\\rho-\\rho\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_k\\hat{a}_k\\right),\\ ] ] the dot denotes a time derivative and @xmath3 describes the excitation loss rate of an individual resonator site . since the excitation losses are continuously compensated by a coherent input drive , a dynamical equilibrium leading to a steady state will be established .",
    "we are here interested in properties of this steady state , such as the mean excitation number and its correlation functions , mainly for the central resonator .    in cavity or circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments",
    "the output fields of the investigated resonators are typically accessible by measurements .",
    "hence in our device the quantity of interest in measurements is the output field of the central resonator .",
    "it is linked to the field in the resonator via the input - output relation @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the output and input fields and @xmath18 the field in the resonator which leaks out at a rate @xmath19 . in cavity and circuit",
    "qed the photons in the cavity usually couple to the photon modes in the output channel so that one can identify the cavity field @xmath18 with the annihilation operator of photons in the cavity . in the central cavity of our setup however , two polaritonic excitations build up due to the strong coupling to the qubit and the photon field in the central resonator can be expressed as a superposition of them , @xmath20 with coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( note that @xmath21 can always be chosen to be positive and that @xmath23 ) .",
    "in the regime of strong coupling we are interested in , the frequencies of the polariton modes @xmath24 and @xmath25 differ strongly enough so that the input drives selectively only excite @xmath24 and we can neglect the @xmath25 excitations in the input - output relation since they only contribute vacuum output . hence for calculating the output fields of the central resonator we can use the modified input - output relation , @xmath26 where @xmath27 . for vacuum input fields , we thus obtain an out photon flux @xmath28 for the central resonator .",
    "the quantumness or non - classicality of light fields can be characterized by the statistics of their excitations . here",
    "a quantity of central interest is the so - called ( time - resolved ) second order correlation function , here for resonator 2 , @xmath29 the significance of the physical interpretation is to have a value for the probability to measure a second particle at time @xmath30 after a particle has been measured at time @xmath31 and compare this to a coherent field where @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath33 it is less likely to measure a second particle .",
    "in this case we speak of an anti - bunched light field that is necessarily non - classical , whereas for @xmath34 we have bunched light meaning a higher probability than for a coherent field .",
    "we note that the @xmath35-function for the output fields is identical to the @xmath35-function of intra - cavity fields provided the input fields are in vacuum .",
    "let us finally stress that although we refer to an implementation in circuit electrodynamics here , our calculations do in most parts not make use of details of this technology and are therefore applicable to other realizations as well .",
    "yet we prefer to discuss them in the context of circuit qed as this technology offers excellent perspectives for realizing a coupling between resonators as we envision it here .",
    "in the regime where the laser intensity is rather low , we are able to numerically solve the master equation directly . here",
    ", an entire regime of rather high nonlinearities @xmath36 , which lessen the probability of high intra - cavity excitations , can be covered for arbitrary values of the tunneling rate @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce a cut - off in the excitation number to give a matrix expression for the excitation ladder operators in a fock basis of bosonic number states .",
    "this reduces the infinitely high dimensional hilbert space to a small number of dimensions and hence allows for the numerical calculation of all operator expectation - values . to corroborate our results we test their convergence as we increase",

    "[ figure8 ] . here , as expected , the @xmath37-function converges to 1 for a long time delay @xmath41 .",
    "the amplitudes of the flucutations around @xmath42 increase with increasing nonlinearities and increasing tunneling rates @xmath1 , however at @xmath43 the system is more excitation anti - bunched if the tunneling strength is weaker and the nonlinearity higher .     as found from a fully numerical solution . *",

    "nevertheless , this method is unable to show a clear crossover between anti - bunched and uncorrelated excitations because the weak drive and high nonlinearity restrict it to low numbers of excitations , implying anti - bunched statistics .",
    "therefore we will present a method to extend the investigation of this set - up to the strongly driven regime , motivated by the possibility of high intra - resonator excitations .",
    "for higher laser intensities , the number of excitations increases rapidly .",
    "since the two outer transmission line resonators do not directly couple to qubits , their only deviation from a coherent state stems from the coupling to the central resonator , which features a nonlinearity due to its coupling to a transmon qubit .",

    "one can clearly see that the coherent background decreases for increasing nonlinearities .",
    "this feature appears since the frequencies of the input drives are resonant with the transition between zero- and single - excitation states in the resonators .",
    "hence with increasing nonlinearity it becomes less probable that higher excitation states become populated as well .",
    "moreover the population of the coherent part of the intra - resonator fields shows a maximum for specific values of @xmath68 .",

    "in summary we have complemented the discussion of a quantum optical josephson interferometer with two methods .",
    "one is a linearization or bogoliubov expansion of the intra - cavity fields around their coherent parts .",
    "the second method , which we have introduced here , combines an exact solution for the central resonator with a mean - field decoupling of the tunneling terms to the outer resonators .    with the proposed methods the circuit qed josephson interferometer can be described for a significant range of all experimentally adjustable parameters , such as the input drive @xmath2 , the nonlinearity @xmath0 and the tunneling strength @xmath1 for a given dissipation rate @xmath3 .",
    "if one is faced with low laser intensities and thus low intra - cavity excitations , the solution can be obtained by solving the master - equation numerically via an excitation cut - off in the matrix representation of the ladder operators as has been shown in section  [ numericalsection ] . in a strong driving regime with intermediate to high tunneling rates but low nonlinearities a good approximation to the excitation output statistics can be given by a bogoliubov expansion in the quantum fluctuations around the coherent background parts of the intra - cavity fields , which we presented in section  [ quantum fluctuations ] .",
    "however , for a strong input drive , low tunneling rates and intermediate to high values of the nonlinearity the bogoliubov expansion breaks down .",
    "here we derived a method in section  [ analytical ] , which we termed p - function mean - field approach , that works extremely well in said regime .",
    "the only regime for which a good approximation could not be gained was one where the drive is strong enough to produce high intra - cavity excitations , but the tunneling rate and nonlinearity are still relatively high .",
    "as a result they are responsible for non - neglectible quantum effects in comparison to the drive or to each other and therefore neither an expansion in @xmath0 nor in @xmath1 would be valid .",
    "a summary of the validity ranges for each of the presented methods is sketched in figure [ regions ] .",
