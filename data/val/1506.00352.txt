    "the energy spectrum of cosmic rays , an important key to realize the origin and acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays , can be simply described by a power law over many magnitudes of energy from @xmath1 ev to @xmath2 ev @xcite , except for a few distinctive structures , such as the knee phenomenon around @xmath3 ev .",
    "the spectral power index rapidly steepens from about @xmath4 before the knee to @xmath5 over the knee @xcite .",
    "numerous works on cosmic ray propagation and acceleration mechanisms have been done to investigate the origin of the knee .",
    "these include the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) spectra origin of the knee based on the theory of non - linear diffusive particle acceleration by shock waves from supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite , and the contribution of nearby pulsar wind producing very hard spectra in the power - law spectra in the knee region @xcite . however , the origin of the knee structure is still unconfirmed .",
    "currently , the interpretations of this phenomenon are based on phenomenological models from experimental measurements .",
    "many results have been given by direct observations with balloon detectors @xcite and indirect observations with air - shower detectors on high altitude mountains @xcite .",
    "the cream experiment , as a balloon detector , has announced precise measurements of energy spectra for individual nuclei ranging from @xmath6 tev to @xmath7 tev @xcite . as an air - shower ground - based detector located @xmath8 m above sea level",
    ", the tibet-@xmath0 array has presented an all - particle energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays from @xmath9 tev to @xmath9 pev , revealing a sharp knee structure around @xmath10 pev . another air - shower experiment with the same altitude as tibet-@xmath0 , argo - ybj , recently gave a new measurement of the energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei , exhibiting a clear knee structure @xcite .",
    "the latest measurements released by argo - ybj are investigated by the joint operation of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) detectors and a cherenkov telescope .",
    "this hybrid detection bridges the gap between balloon detectors and ground - based experiments , improves the shower energy resolution and enhances the capability to discriminate showers induced by light nuclei from events initiated by heavier nuclei .",
    "they yield clear evidence for a knee - like structure in the spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei under 1 pev @xcite .    in the following discussions ,",
    "we explain the knee spectra measured by argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 by phenomenological models .",
    "the superposition of energy spectrum of individual components described by a simple broken power - law can not reconcile the light components and all - particle energy spectra .",
    "we therefore propose a parametric model to reconcile them . in sec .",
    "@xmath6 we give two different scenarios and parameters to fit the experimental data .",
    "@xmath11 presents the average mass .",
    "finally , sec.@xmath10 gives some discussion and conclusions .",
    "cosmic rays emitted from the sources are most likely accelerated in the strong shock fronts of snrs by the dsa mechanism .",
    "the particles are deflected by chaotic magnetic fields , cross shock fronts frequently , and therefore gain energy up to the pev region .",
    "this acceleration leads to the observed approximate power - law spectrum .",
    "the energy spectrum is modified during diffusive propagation .",
    "the spectra near the sources vary from that observed on the earth , which may due to nuclear spallation or decay , ionization losses , leakage from the galaxy and solar modulation for low energies .",
    "we try to adopt two different phenomenological models to explain the observed energy spectra around knee structure .",
    "one is an expression of a simple broken power - law and the other is the broken power - law with non - linear modification term .",
    "the all - particle primary energy spectra derived from extensive air shower experiments can be described by a broken power - law function .",
    "we therefore use this kind of function to parameterize the observed differential energy spectra for individual elements of cosmic ray , which can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the differential flux of the individual element with energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the normalization constant , @xmath16 represents the break point of the proton spectrum , @xmath17 is the atomic number , @xmath18 is the power index in the energy range @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denotes the power index when @xmath21 .",
    "we try to use this expression to fit both the combined energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei observed by argo - ybj and the all - particle energy spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 .",
    "the interaction model sibyll for tibet data is used in this work .",
    "we firstly fix the energy spectra of each component below the knee region , and then extrapolate the spectra beyond the knee .",
    "the observed data of individual elements ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) from cream are adopted .",
    "for the spectrum index of each element , see @xcite .",
    "an expression of simple power - law @xmath30 is used to fit the spectrum of each component , with the fitting parameters @xmath31 and spectral indices listed in table 1 .",

    "the break point for other elements can be calculated by @xmath43 .",
    "the spectral indices of all elements at the higher energy range beyond the knee region are assumed to be the same value as the result from argo - ybj , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "we sum up the energy spectra of all elements to get the approximate all - particle spectrum , seen as the red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : zy1 ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : zy1 ] that this all - particle spectrum based on argo - ybj observation with this simple broken power - law model can not match the observed all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 .",
    "the simple broken power - law function therefore can not describe the energy spectrum in the knee region , which perhaps is due to the influence of the dsa mechanism .",
    "[ fig : zy1 ]      since the differential energy spectrum in the form of the simple broken power - law can not reconcile the observations of argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 , a new correction term is added , so the broken power - law can now be expressed as @xmath45(1+\\frac{e}{z\\epsilon_{b}})^{-\\delta\\gamma } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is assumed to be a @xmath17-dependent parameter , and @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "the dsa mechanism may result in a spectrum with concave - up curvature , so we multiply the non - linear term @xmath48 into the simple broken power - law to structure a concave - up form as a phenomenological model . without this non - linear term , the superimposed all - particle spectrum from all elements is smooth and can not fit the sharp knee structure as measured by tibet-@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we have tried some parameters in a non-@xmath17-dependent form , but these can not match the data , so we finally adopt the form in equation ( [ eq : zy2 ] ) .",
    "an equation to express the non - linear effects is proposed in @xcite .",
    "they propose the non - linear process by a modified exponential cut - off expression for the spectra from sources , and then deduce the observed spectra by the superposition of these spectra . from their formula , the model they deduced is a kind of broken power - law multiplied by a complex modified term . while our expression form is simpler , we modify the simple broken power - law directly as the observed spectra and then parameterize this scenario .",
    "combined with the newly published measurements from argo - ybj , our model is easier to quantify the parameters precisely . a model with precisely confirmed parameters",
    "will help us to review its intrinsic physical issues . from equation ( [ eq : zy2 ] ) , we get a good fit result to match the observations from both argo - ybj and tibet-@xmath0 with parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the proton .",
    "@xmath53 values of other elements are assumed to obey the formula @xmath54 .",
    "the fitting spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zy2 ] , where the solid red line represents the all - particle spectrum . from fig .",
    "[ fig : zy2 ] we can see that the all - particle spectrum based on argo - ybj observation can match the observed all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0 . based on this model , the distinctive knee structure is mostly contributed by heavy elements such as @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig : zy2 ]    in order to obtain the best fitting parameters for the non - linear model , we employ the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xcite , a very efficient algorithm , to achieve our goal . considering that the calculation of @xmath55 will be affected by the too small errors of all - particle spectrum given by tibet-@xmath0",
    ", we amplify the errors of this spectrum by taking account of energy resolution .",
    "the initial form of data with errors listed in the literature @xcite are expressed by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the flux and @xmath58 denotes the systematic error . as a new deduced additional error , a new term",
    "is added to this expression , i.e. @xmath59 , where @xmath18 denotes the spectrum index .",
    "we take the energy resolution @xmath60 as a constant .",
    "the following @xmath61 parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath47 , @xmath16 and @xmath53 , are set free for the mcmc algorithm , where @xmath46 consists of free parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 and redshift @xmath17 .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath53 here refer to protons as mentioned above .",
    "because every spectrum index of elements in the higher energy band beyond the knee is supposed to be the same value , we can get the @xmath53 of other components from the @xmath53 of the proton . by this mcmc algorithm",
    ", we obtain the best fitting parameters as follows : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the proton .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath16 decide the shapes of the energy spectra .",
    "different values result in different spectra , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : zy4 ] .",
    "the measurements of hydrogen and helium nuclei spectra using the sibyll model by the kascade group @xcite are compared with our model in fig .",
    "[ fig : zy4 ] .",
    "the kaskade group claimed that the energy spectra of both proton and helium show a knee - like feature , but in our model , this seems not to be the case .",
    "[ fig : zy4 ]",
    "a commonly - used quantity to characterize the mass composition of cosmic rays is the mean logarithmic mass , which is defined as @xmath69 @xmath70 being the relative fraction of nuclei of mass @xmath71 .",
    "the average mass is reported by many air shower experiments , but the results are divergent because of the poor primary mass resolution .",
    "we calculate the average mass for two cases : one for the former non - linear model and another for the latter best fitting case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zy5 ] .    from our derived average mass of cosmic rays , we can see @xmath72 goes up between several hundreds of tev and several tens of pev .",
    "it implies that heavier components occupy an increasing proportion with the increase of energy , and predicts an iron - dominant composition above the knee .",
    "but the components above the knee are not all @xmath29 , because @xmath72 for @xmath29 is about 4.0 .",
    "further experimental measurements of the chemical composition of high energy cosmic rays will verify our prediction .",
    "if the light components dominate the knee structure , this model can be excluded , while if the heavy components dominate the knee structure , this model will be confirmed , and the measurements will be helpful to improve the model parameters .     [",
    "fig : zy5 ]",
    "many mechanisms have been discussed to explain the knee structure of cosmic rays , including the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays in supernova explosion shock fronts , leakage from the galaxy , interactions with background particles in the interstellar medium , and new physics of interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "some models are likely to be excluded , however , such as the leaky box model , interactions with background particles and new types of interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "the leakage from the galaxy does not give a distinct change of the spectral slope at the knee .",
    "the scenario of interactions with background particles yields a very light mean logarithmic mass , while the measurements indicate an increase of mass with energy . for new types of interactions in the atmosphere ,",
    "there are no inconsistencies between the different air shower components by the simultaneous observations from kascade , and the measurements of different air shower components can be interpreted with standard particle physics @xcite .",
    "we propose two scenarios to reconcile the light components and all - particle energy spectra by phenomenological models . in the first scenario",
    ", we use a simple broken power - law model to fit the combined energy spectrum of hydrogen and helium nuclei measured by argo - ybj and the all - particle spectrum measured by tibet-@xmath0 , but the all - particle spectrum can not be fitted by this model . hence , the simple broken power - law fails to explain the knee structure . in the second scenario ,",
    "a non - linear modification term is added to the broken power - law .",
    "this modified broken power - law model with non - linear acceleration effects can describe the sharp knee structure .",
    "the mechanism of non - linear effects at shock fronts of snrs has been explained in earlier works @xcite .",
    "particles with higher energies can scatter farther ahead of the shock , which results in an effectively higher compression ratio , so a more locally hard spectrum is produced , and a concave - up curvature to the accelerated - particle distribution is expected .",
    "in addition , this modified model predicts that heavy elements dominate at the knee . based on this model , some models holding the viewpoints of weak knee structure or protons dominating the knee are likely to be excluded .",
    "precise measurements of energy spectra of individual elements in the knee region will test our model ."
