    "one particular direction of extension for which we are more confident , and which we are currently pursuing , is the study of diverse heterogeneity distributions . in our illustrative example , the ( intrinsic frequency ) heterogeneity distribution was simply a normal one ( with different variances ) . a single scalar quantity ( the slope , @xmath74 ) of the correlation between heterogeneity and system state was sufficient to improve our coarse description here .",
    "this slope is but the first nontrivial coefficient of an expansion of the system state ( here , the excess phases ) as a function of a random variable ( here , the intrinsic frequency ) . in effect",
    ", this is a ",
    "one - term \" polynomial chaos @xcite expansion of a function of a random variable ( the oscillator frequency ) with a particular probability distribution .",
    "it is straightforward to use different expansions ( depending on the distribution of the random variable , different hierarchies of polynomials are applicable , see for example the askey scheme @xcite ) ; it is also straightforward to use more than one term in the expansion in a particular polynomial set if the correlation exhibits more structure than the straight line we observed here .",
    "this research avenue provides a direct link between existing and developing tools in the study of uncertainty quantification ( polynomial chaos approaches , and the associated collocation schemes ) with the study of coupled heterogeneous oscillator problems , even when heterogeneity arises in more than one properties of the coupled system .",
    "one particularly interesting direction for network dynamics arises when the oscillator behavior depends crucially on the _ degree _ of this oscillator in the overall network .",
    "if correlations between node degrees and oscillator states quickly develop in system startup transients , the tools we outlined above may well serve in successful coarse - graining of the overall network dynamics .",
    "the equation - free ( ef ) approach to modeling and computation for complex / multiscale systems has been developed for problems that can , in principle , be described at multiple levels . in particular , it is applicable to systems for which the evolution equations are available at a  fine \" ( atomistic , microscopic , individual - based ) scale , while the equations for the  coarse \" ( macroscopic , system level ) behavior , which is of interest , are not available in closed form .",
    "we will illustrate the ef approach through a brief description of _ coarse projective integration _ and coarse fixed point computation .",
    "the system of interest is completely specified at any moment in time by a set of fine or microscopic variables @xmath45 .",
    "we start with the assumption that an appropriate set of coarse variables @xmath87 ( observables in terms of which closed equations can in principle be written at the macroscopic level ) have been selected .",
    "we also assume that good _ lifting _ ( @xmath88 ) and _ restriction _ ( @xmath89 $ ] )",
    "operators are available : the lifting creates fine scale initial conditions consistent with prescribed values of macroscopic observables , while the restriction obtains the values of the observables from a fine scale state .",
    "these operators effectively  translate \" fine scale states to the corresponding coarse ones , and coarse ones to consistent fine ones respectively . for our illustrative example , the  fine scale \" state at a time instance @xmath90 is the vector of phase angles of all oscillators @xmath91 , while the corresponding set of coarse variable values is @xmath92 .",
    "a coarse projective integration step consists of the following sub - steps :    1 .",
    "lifting step : start with initial condition @xmath93 for the coarse macroscopic variables and lift them to a consistent microscopic description : @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "2 .   evolve the oscillators using @xmath95 as the initial condition for their phases in the microscopic simulator for a time @xmath96 , long enough for the fast components of the dynamics to equilibrate , but short compared to the slow ( coarse ) system time scales ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the final state of this step is @xmath97 .",
    "3 .   evolve the microscopic variables , @xmath95 , for additional @xmath22 time steps , generating the values @xmath98 , @xmath99 to @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath101 $ ] .",
