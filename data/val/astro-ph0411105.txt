    "indeed , tran et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that a certain fraction of galaxies in evolved , x - ray luminous groups are significantly asymmetric which is evidence of galaxy interactions .",
    "n - body simulations of isolated groups indicate that dynamical friction should also play an important role in the evolution of groups ( bode , cohn , & lugger 1993 ; bode et al . 1994 ; athanassoula , makino , & bosma 1997 ) .    in such a scenario",
    "the groups are not in a dynamical equilibrium because of the high frequency of galaxy interactions .",
    "interactions and merging of galaxies has been shown to play a major role in the evolution of galaxy morphology ( eg .",
    "toomre & toomre 1972 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) .",
    "the general belief is that early - type ( e / s0 ) galaxies are formed by merging of spiral galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ; mihos 1995 ) . as a result of multiple merging , a massive",
    ", central galaxy can be formed .",
    "obviously this phenomenon must be especially rapid in compact groups .",
    "for this reason a lot of efforts have been devoted to the study of dynamical evolution and morphological content of compact groups ( e.g. hickson & mendes de oliveira 1992 , mendes de oliveira & hickson 1994 ; tovmassian 2001 , 2002 ; kelm & focardi 2004 ; lee et al .",
    "2004 ; coziol , brinks , & bravo - alfaro 2004 ) .",
    "contrary to expectation , shimada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found no statistical difference in the frequency of occurrence of emission - line galaxies between the hickson compact groups ( hickson 1982 ; hickson et al .",
    "1992 ) and the field .",
    "however , kelm & focardi ( 2004 ) found that compact groups identified in the updated zwicky catalogue of galaxies contain a higher fraction of early - type galaxies with respect to the field . on the other hand , colbert , mulchaey , & zabludoff ( 2001 )",
    "have shown that early - type galaxies in the field appear to have more shells and tidal features than those in groups , a fact that they attribute to merging events that occur also in the field , and whose signatures probably survive due to isolation of these galaxies.these results seem to be confirmed by marcum , aars , & fanelli ( 2004 ) although they have also identified a small fraction of isolated early - type galaxies that show no evidence of a merger history , and thus appear to be passively evolving primordial galaxies .",
    "recently we have used the ramella et al .",
    "( 2002 ) uzc - ssrs2 group catalogue , based on the updated zwicky catalogue ( uzc ; falco et al .",
    "1999 ) and the southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs2 ; da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) to show that poor groups have a prolate spheroidal shape configuration with a mean intrinsic axial ratio ( @xmath2 ) of @xmath3 and standard deviation @xmath4 ( plionis , basilakos , & tovmassian 2004 , [ hereafter pbt04 ] ) . as interaction",
    "are more likely in such elongated systems , poor groups are good laboratories to test galaxy formation theories and study their evolution .    in this paper",
    "we compare the morphological and luminosity content ( in the k and b bands ) of the group galaxy members with those of isolated galaxies .",
    "we have used the poor groups of the uzc - ssrs2 catalogue ( usgc , ramella et al . 2002 ) as defined in pbt04 , i.e. , groups with galaxy membership @xmath5 (  richness  in what follows ) in the range @xmath6 and radial velocity @xmath7 km @xmath8 , since within this velocity limit the groups appear to have constant space density and therefore they are assumed to constitute a roughly volume - limited sample . as in pbt04 , we divide groups in different richness classes .",
    "all candidate fake groups ( see pbt04 ) were excluded from our analysis .",
    "furthermore we excluded those of our @xmath9 groups which focardi & kelm ( 2002 ) identified as triplets ( due to possible projection contamination ) , i.e. , usgc u033 , u039 , u066 , u070 , u076 , and u127 ( which correspond to fk 12 , 14 , 26 , 27 , 29 and 35 ) .",
    "as a starting point for our analysis we use 169 groups containing in total 932 galaxies , out of which 58 , 59 , 35 and 17 groups have a richness ( @xmath5 ) of 4 , 5 - 6 , 7 - 8 and 9 - 10 galaxies , respectively .    for comparison we used the catalogue of isolated galaxies ( igs ) compiled by karachentseva , lebedev & shcherbanovskij ( 1986 ) .",
    "this catalogue is widely used as a source of isolated galaxies ( e.g. marcum et al .",
    "2004 ; varela et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it contains 1051 entries , among which there are 329 galaxies with @xmath10 km @xmath8 .",
    "note that this galaxy sample has the same magnitude limit as our group galaxies ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "two of the igs , pgc 008220 and pgc 059971 , were found in usgc groups and were deleted from the ig list .",
    "galaxy morphological types for both poor group galaxies ( ggs ) and isolated ones were taken from the ned ( http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu ) .",
    "since the galaxies we are dealing with are nearby and sufficiently bright ( @xmath12 ) , we expect that the ned morphological classification into the two broad categories ( early and late types ) is very accurate .",
    "we deduce absolute magnitudes in the @xmath13 band for two families of galaxies : ( a ) e / s0 galaxies and ( b ) spiral galaxies ( sa and later , including irregulars ) for both the considered usgc group members and the igs .",
    "we used the 2mass @xmath14 magnitudes ( see jarrett et al .",
    "2000 and http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass ) , corrected for the extinction in our galaxy according to schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) as given in ned .",
    "the quoted 2mass average magnitude 1@xmath15 uncertainty is @xmath160.04 for @xmath17 and @xmath160.09 for @xmath18 .",
    "the absolute @xmath19 magnitudes for all studied galaxies were extracted from leda ( paturel et al .",
    "1997 , http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr ) and their quoted individual 1@xmath15 uncertainties are quite large , the average of which is estimated to be @xmath20 .    note that in order to determine absolute magnitudes the radial velocities of groups or individual galaxies were corrected for the peculiar velocity of the local group and a local velocity field that contains a virgo - centric infall component and a bulk flow given by the expectations of linear theory ( see branchini , plionis , & sciama 1996 ) , assuming a hubble constant of @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 .",
    "we excluded from our analysis groups and isolated galaxies that have @xmath23 km s@xmath22 , as their radial velocities may be significantly contaminated by peculiar velocities .    in order to investigate the mutual completeness of the gg and ig samples we employed the non - parametric kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test and found that their redshift distributions may be considered ( at a @xmath2425% level ) as having been drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this also implies that there is no systematic difference in their limiting magnitudes .",
    "we determine the mean fraction of e / s0 galaxies , @xmath25 ) , over our group sample , as well as in the sample of igs .",
    "we use only those groups of which all members have known morphological type , in total 102 groups spanning the whole original sample richness range and which contain in total 583 galaxies ( 38 , 27 , 27 and 10 groups with @xmath9 , 5 - 6 , 7 - 8 and 9 - 10 members , respectively ) .    for the sample of 329 igs we find @xmath26",
    "while for the group galaxies we obtain a significantly higher mean fraction of @xmath27 .",
    "this result is in accordance with the `` morphology - density '' relation of dressler ( 1981 ) kuntschner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also noticed that early - type galaxies are rare in low - density environments .",
    "the higher relative number of e / s0 galaxies in groups favors the view that they are formed by the interaction and merging of spiral galaxies .",
    "the number of such galaxy encounters is expected to be even higher in high density environments , ie .",
    ", in groups with large @xmath5 .",
    "to test this we estimate the mean fraction of early - type galaxies as a function of increasing group richness ( @xmath5 ) and find : @xmath28 0.21 , 0.19 , 0.29 and 0.26 for groups with @xmath9 , 5 - 6 , 7 - 8 , 9 - 10 members , respectively , suggesting a weak dependence of @xmath29 on the group richness .",
    "however , it seems surprising that the relative number of e / s0 s and possibly their formation rate depends only weakly on the group richness and thus on the group mass .",
    "we investigate this issue further by correlating @xmath29 with the velocity dispersion , @xmath30 , of the corresponding groups ( fig .  1 ) , and we find that there is indeed a significant although weak correlation with the group velocity dispersion increasing with @xmath29 ( in agreement with zabludoff 2000 ) .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is 0.2 and the probability of random correlation is 0.045 .",
    "meanwhile , such a correlation is not seen for groups of a given richness class , which confirms that the effect is due to an increase of the velocity dispersion with the group mass .",
    "the true underlying correlation should be even stronger than the observed one since the dependence of the measured group velocity dispersion on group orientation can weaken it .",
    "this effect results from the fact that elongated prolate - like groups orientated roughly along the line of sight will appear to have a higher velocity dispersion while when seen orthogonal to the line of sight they will appear to have smaller velocity dispersions .",
    "another parameter that should play a significant role in the quantification of the rate of galaxy encounters in groups is the group crossing time , @xmath31 , defined by : @xmath32 with @xmath33 the median true group major axis and @xmath34 the median true ( deprojected ) group velocity dispersion",
    ".    the probability of an encounter in a group with a given number of members should be higher in groups with smaller @xmath31 .",
    "however , effective interactions that could alter galaxy morphologies should happen in environments of relatively low velocity dispersion which implies a relatively large @xmath31 for a given group size .",
    "note also that in high @xmath30 systems that are also extremely elongated , effective galaxy interactions may happen at the apogees of the spatial configuration where the relative velocities of galaxies will be minimal and where the member galaxies will tend to accumulate . clearly , the dynamics of galaxy mergers in non - spherical structures is a multi - parameter problem and not easily quantified .",
    "we attempt to estimate the mean crossing time for groups of different richness ( @xmath5 ) by taking into account the fact that they are prolate - like ( plionis et al . 2004 ) and that their member galaxies will probably have mostly radial orbits ( moving along the major axis of the prolate spheroid ) .",
    "the _ true _",
    "median @xmath30 is estimated using the quasi - spherical groups i.e. those with axial ratio close to unity , since due to orientation effects , the quasi - spherical groups should typically be those elongated groups seen end - on and therefore their velocity dispersion is closer to the true value .",
    "we find @xmath35 km / sec and 360 km / sec for the @xmath9 and @xmath36 groups respectively . in order to estimate the true size of groups we rely on a monte - carlo simulation method",
    ", the details of which will be presented elsewhere ( plionis & tovmassian 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is based on searching for the intrinsic group major axis distribution that once folded through the intrinsic group axial ratio distribution ( determined in plionis et al .",
    "2004 ) and random orientations with respect to the line of sight , will produce the projected monte - carlo group shape parameters ( axial ratio , minor and major axis ) distributions which are in agreement with the corresponding observed ones .",
    "we find @xmath37 and @xmath38 mpc , respectively for the @xmath9 and @xmath36 groups and therefore the group crossing times are : @xmath39 and 5.8 gyrs , respectively .",
    "to test the effect of the different values of @xmath31 on the galaxy encounter and merging rate , disentangling the possible effect of the different group orientations with respect to the line of sight , we determined the mean @xmath29 in the most elongated chain - like groups ( ie .",
    ", those which are preferentially seen perpendicular to the line of sight ) for two group categories : those with @xmath31 higher and smaller than the mean value of the corresponding group subsample .",
    "there are 36 groups with axial ratio @xmath40 ( all of them with @xmath41 ) and with known morphology of all their members .",
    "we find @xmath42 and @xmath43 for groups with @xmath31 smaller and larger than the corresponding group mean value , respectively .",
    "although the difference is not very significant it does imply , as expected , that the crossing time is an important parameter in the quantification of the rate of galaxy interactions .",
    "if e / s0 group galaxies are formed as the result of galaxy merging , one should expect them to be more luminous than isolated e / s0 s .",
    "we estimated the mean @xmath44 and @xmath45 absolute magnitudes of e / s0 and spiral galaxies ( sa and later ) in our original group sample ( @xmath46 ) and isolated galaxies ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the frequency distribution of the absolute magnitudes of the group and isolated early - type galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "we also derived the absolute magnitude difference ( @xmath47 ) between ggs and igs and found @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the e / s0 s and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the spirals ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the ks test shows that the gg and ig @xmath13-band absolute magnitude distributions of early - type galaxies are significantly different , with the probability @xmath52 of being drawn from the same population .",
    "the corresponding @xmath53 distributions do not show a significant difference .",
    "furthermore , no difference in absolute magnitude ( neither for @xmath54 nor for @xmath53 ) is observed between group and isolated spirals .",
    "the ks test shows that their distributions have a probability of being drawn from the same population of @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively for the @xmath13 and @xmath19 bands . we have also found that the values @xmath45 and @xmath44 of e / s0 galaxies do not depend on the group richness .",
    "we conclude that indeed there is strong evidence that the group e / s0 galaxies are brighter , especially in @xmath13 with respect to the igs of either type , e / s0 or spiral .",
    "the fact that absolute magnitudes of the group e / s0 galaxies are on average brighter than those of isolated galaxies by @xmath57 is consistent with the idea that e / s0 group galaxies are formed by merging of two spirals of about the same luminosity .",
    "the latter is in general agreement with the environmental dependence of the ir luminosity function found by balogh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "finally , we compare the @xmath58 colours of the considered subsamples .",
    "we find that the mean colour of the e / s0 galaxies in groups is redder by about @xmath59 than that of the igs , and the corresponding colour distributions are significantly different , having a ks probability of consistency of only @xmath60 .",
    "a redder colour of the group e / s0 s may be due to shed of gas during merging . as expected , we find that both group and isolated spiral galaxies are bluer on average in comparison to the group and isolated e / s0 galaxies ( see fig .  3 and table  1 ) . fig .",
    "3 also shows the presence of a few relatively blue galaxies ( @xmath61 ) among the group e / s0 s for which weak starburst processes , induced by interactions , could be responsible ( zepf , whitmore , & levison 1991 ) .",
    "we have found that the mean fraction of early - type galaxies , @xmath29 , in poor usgc groups of galaxies ( with @xmath62 km s@xmath22 and galaxy members @xmath6 ) is @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 higher than that of the field galaxies .",
    "this fraction is a weakly increasing function of group richness and thus of group mass .",
    "this trend is also confirmed from the statistically significant , although weak , increase of @xmath29 with group velocity dispersion .",
    "we have also found that the mean near - infrared absolute magnitude of e / s0 galaxies in our groups ( @xmath65 ) does not depend on the number of the group members and is @xmath66 brighter than that of isolated e / s0 galaxies , while the mean blue absolute magnitude , @xmath67 , of e / s0 galaxies in these groups is brighter by @xmath68 than the isolated ones .",
    "no such differences are found in the corresponding spiral galaxy samples .",
    "we conclude that e / s0 galaxies in groups may be the result of merging of two galaxies of about the same luminosity .",
    "the @xmath69 colours of the group e / s0 galaxies are redder , by about @xmath59 on average , than those of isolated e / s0 galaxies .",
    "these results are in agreement with the paradigm in which the early - type galaxies , in relatively dense environments , are formed by merging .",
    "the redder @xmath69 colours of the group e / s0 galaxies in comparison to the isolated ones shows that the formation processes of the former somehow differs from that of isolated galaxies .",
    "an open question is still how the isolated e / s0 galaxies are formed .",
    "various authors have found signs of disturbed morphologies in field e / s0 s ( eg .",
    "colbert et al . 2001 ; kuntschner et al . 2002 ; marcum et al . 2004 ) .",
    "although the bright isolated e / s0 galaxies may also be remnants of merged groups or pairs of galaxies , the isolated faint e / s0 s probably are not ( eg . marcum et al .",
    "2004 ) ; their origin may be primordial and thus different from those in groups .",
