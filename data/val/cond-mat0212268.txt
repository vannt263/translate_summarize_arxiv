    "in recent years , diverse mechanical manipulation techniques of single - molecule , such as optical tweezers , atomic force microscopy , and soft microneedles have been applied in probing basic mechanical , physical and chemical properties of single biological macromolecule , such as proteins , nucleic acids , and molecular motors .",
    "the basic principle is to exert force in the @xmath1 range on the studied molecules , and then force - extension ( fecs ) or extension - force curves ( efcs ) are recorded@xcite .",
    "many useful insights about biomolecules were obtained by analyzing these curves , going from the detailed elastic properties@xcite to complex structure    experiments@xcite . in experiments of unzipping of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) ,",
    "fecs show gross features , which reflect simply the local gc versus at content along the sequence@xcite . while in stretching single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) , very different efcs",
    "have been observed : the efcs recorded by maier _",
    "_ showed extremely smooth@xcite ; in contrast , rief _ et al .",
    "_ found that ssdna end - to - end distance ( eed ) suddenly changed during narrow force range . in recent unzipping shorter rna experiment ,",
    "except eed increasing abruptly , efcs with intermediates were observed@xcite .    on the theoretical side , compared to the great effort in understanding the unzipping of dsdna@xcite ,",
    "little attention has been paid to the rna or ssdna stretching problem@xcite .",
    "montanari and m@xmath2zard discussed the efcs of a homogeneous ssdna sequence .",
    "their model exhibited a second order phase transition from a collapsed globular state to an extended necklace - like phase@xcite .",
    "zhou and zhang pointed out the important roles of electrostatic and base - pair stacking interactions played in stretching ssdna@xcite .",
    "m@xmath3ller _ et .",
    "considered how the random disorder sequence modifies efcs characteristics@xcite .",
    "et al . _ explored quantitatively how nuclei acids structure determines a broad range of fecs from very rugged to completely featureless .",
    "they found that apart from the entropy elasticity of the unpaired single strand@xcite , there are two additional mechanism , the compensation effect and the contribution of suboptimal secondary structures smoothing the features of fecs@xcite . though their results were discussed on the constant extension ensemble , it may be true for constant force ensemble@xcite .",
    "there are several reasons to attract increasing attention on the force stretching rna or ssdna .",
    "first , studies of stretching rna may generate new insights into the rna folding problem@xcite , including folding pathways and the energy landscape@xcite .",
    "unlike the simpler hairpin structure , such as dsdna , rna may fold into complicated branched structures , and the native state has to compete with a large number of suboptimal states . exerting force on the molecule",
    "will drive the native state into metastable states , which might be seen from the fecs or efcs .",
    "second , force stretching provides a direct approach to measure rna thermodynamic parameters , which are key in predicting rna secondary structure@xcite .",
    "in addition , the force stretching rna is also an intriguing physical problem , e.g. , how rna secondary structures determine the outcoming efcs@xcite , and how to describe the rna properties far from equilibrium induced by external force is still an open question@xcite .",
    "because the structure complexity of rna is intermediate between dsdna and protein , the exploration may also be valuable in understanding properties of dsdna and protein@xcite .",
    "although the theoretical models about force stretching rna molecules@xcite have been proposed , more realistic and detailed models are needed@xcite .",
    "we note that with a few exceptions@xcite , almost all models were restricted the study of homogeneous or completely random rna sequences . whereas stretching experiments showed that sequences affect efcs dramatically@xcite . in very recent experiment@xcite ,",
    "dessinges _ et . al _ found that excluded - volume interactions play an essential role as stretching ssdna , which were assumed to be negligible before . to take into account the two factors , in this paper we will modify and extend the statistical model of double - stranded chain conformations developed by chen and dill to constant force stretching ensemble@xcite .",
    "we think that their model is suitable for our aim .",
    "first , the model retains a relatively high degree of realism , which the sequence dependence , nonlocal intrachain contacts , and the excluded volume interactions are accounted for explicitly .",
    "second , the model is more  microscopic \" , i.e. , only one parameter , base - pair contact energy is required .",
    "the entropy is calculated from the number of conformations directly .",
    "in addition , because the model can completely characterize the full energy landscape of secondary structure having chain lengths up to hundreds bases@xcite , the exploration of how force changes the folding pathways or energy landscape of rna is valuable .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first , in sec   [ reviewpolymer ] , simply overview the statistical model of double - stranded chain molecules developed by chen and dill . in sec .",
    "[ stretchdouble ] , we extend the models about two classes of chain molecules , hairpin and rna - like secondary structures conformations to constant force stretching cases , respectively . their corresponding efcs , contact probability , population distribution and re - entering phenomena , and the difference are discussed in sec .

    "[ conclusion ] is our conclusion .",
    "some numerical process are relegated to appendices . in the appendix  [ endtoendhairpin ]",
    "we illustrate the calculation of eed with a special case in hairpin conformations , namely when the closed graph is of type 1 . in the appendix",

    "any two pairs of curved links in a polymer graph must bear one of three relationships : nested , unrelated and crossing linked .",
    "graphs of the double - stranded chain conformations involve no crossing links , examples of which include the simplest hairpin structure , such as dsdna , and mainly secondary structures among nucleic acids and antiparallel @xmath9-sheets in proteins . in terms of polymer graph ,",

    "chen and dill developed a matrix multiplication method@xcite .",
    "a complex polymer graph can be divided into a series of faces consecutively , in which face is a region in graph that is bounded by curved and straight lines and contains no other edges ; see the shadowed region in fig .",
    "[ polygraph ] .",
    "faces are classified into five types : left ( l ) , middle ( m ) , right ( r ) , left - right ( lr ) and isolated ( i ) , according to the arrangement of the nested curved links that bound the face .",
    "the calculation of the full partition function @xmath16 for a given graph @xmath14 is correspondingly separated into two steps : to count all conformations for each face , as if they are isolated and independent of each other , then to assemble these conformations into @xmath16 . to avoid that conformations of different faces bump into each other ( excluded - volume interaction ) , more detailed information about the conformations of faces is needed . on two dimension ( 2d ) lattice ,",
    "it is realized by exact enumeration .",
    "first , conformations of each face are classified into sixteen types according to the shape of ports ( inlet and outlet ) through which it is connected to other faces ; see fig .",
