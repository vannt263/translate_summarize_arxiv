    "impedance surfaces for microwave frequency antennas and other devices have been recently introduced and actively investigated .",
    "these surfaces are mostly thought to be applied for reducing surface waves , for controlling the plane - wave reflection phase , and as artificial magnetic conductors @xcite .",
    "high - impedance surfaces are thin composite layers ( as a rule backed by a metal plane ) , whose surface impedance has a parallel resonance at a certain frequency or at several frequencies . within the resonant band the surface of the layer behaves as a magnetic wall for normally incident plane waves .",
    "that is why the his are often called _ artificial magnetic conductors ( amc)_. in practical cases , the thickness of an amc layer at resonance is much smaller than a quarter of the wavelength .",
    "it means that the reflection coefficient of a plane wave from the structure can be close to + 1 at a very small distance from the ground plane .",
    "this means that the electromagnetic interaction of a horizontal electric current with an amc can be constructive even for very small distances from the current to the ground plane .",
    "this is why amc are prospective for designing low profile antennas @xcite .",
    "infinite ( practically very high ) surface impedance means that the tangential magnetic field component is very weak at the surface of the wall .",
    "tangential electric field can be strong at this surface .",
    "the reflection properties of a his depend on the frequency , and the his resonant band can be defined as a frequency range at which the phase change of the reflected electric field is within certain limits ( usually from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) .",
    "a his conventionally possesses a rather narrow band of amc operation .",
    "in general , these structures support surface waves , however there is an important difference with the case of a simple metal - backed dielectric layer : there are stop bands for surface waves .",
    "therefore , the same structures interacting with plane waves as his operate as _ ebg ( electromagnetic band gap ) structures _ with respect to the surface waves .",
    "sometimes they are called as _ 2d pbg ( photonic band gap ) structures _ which is not a proper term at microwaves . besides the high - frequency band gaps whose band structure is related with the spatial periodicity of the amc layer",
    ", there can be one or two low - frequency ones , related with the resonance of the surface impedance which can also hold in the regime of the surface wave .    while the amc are useful to design low - profile antennas @xcite , artificial material fillings are useful in the design of small antennas , especially magnetic materials can be utilized as a mean to reduce the antenna size @xcite . according to a simple theoretical model of a small patch antenna as a resonator , the resonant frequency and impedance bandwidth @xmath3 of a small antenna depend on the relative permittivity and permeability of the loading material as f_r ~ , bw ~.",
    "suphere @xmath4 means the proportionality . in practice , these expressions are not very accurate , and the result of loading depends on the antenna type , but still the tendency predicted by holds",
    ".    there has been some work on the effects of magneto - dielectric substrates on the bandwidth of microstrip antennas @xcite , but these results are contradictory .",
    "papers @xcite and @xcite conclude that the best filling is a magnetic material with large @xmath5 , although the authors of @xcite conclude that the best filling is a material with both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , the usefulness of magnetic filling is evident from the known literature .    in paper",
    "@xcite a material with a finite isotropic permeability was considered as a loading material .",
    "natural magnetic materials at frequencies higher than @xmath8 mhz are ferrimagnetic crystals ( for example , hexaferrites ) .",
    "these ferrites are not very attractive for applications in small antennas since they are lossy , heavy , and expensive . probably because of this ,",
    "antennas with ferrite or ferromagnetic filling have been analyzed mainly from the point of view of electrical control of their resonant frequency and radiation pattern , see , e.g. , @xcite . possible realizations of artificial magnetics at @xmath9 ghz can be based on the resonant principle : artificial magnetic materials can be formed by small particles with a resonant magnetic susceptibility .",
    "these should resonate at a frequency which is close to the resonant frequency of an unloaded antenna .",
    "such artificial magnetic materials are practically known in the frequency range @xmath10 ghz ( the structures formed by the so - called _ split - ring resonators _ ) .",
    "such loadings have been successfully tested with patch antennas in @xcite : a @xmath11 size patch antenna with the bandwidth of @xmath12 has been reported in that paper .    in certain frequency regions ,",
    "high - impedance surfaces behave as layers of effective magnetic materials , and can be used as magnetic fillings in the antenna design .",
    "amc are not similar to natural isotropic magnetics .",
    "these can not be properly described in terms of magnetic permeability .",
    "formally , one can introduce an effective permeability , but it will strongly depend on the incident plane wave polarization and the angle of incidence .",
    "this dependence is a spatial dispersion effect .",
    "however , this effect does not forbid one to use such composite layers as a magnetic filling material .",
    "recently , these artificial layers have been used to reduce the size of antennas @xcite and filters @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the present paper is to use an artificial material which would possess the properties of both amc and magneto - dielectric composite @xcite within a rather wide resonance band . in this paper , the new",
    "his @xcite playing also the role of an artificial magnetic material ( amm ) is tested under a patch antenna .",
    "the choice of this material can be explained in terms of the angular stability of the resonant frequency .",
    "the known amc introduced in papers @xcite have the resonance depending on the angle of incidence @xmath13 and wave polarization ( te or tm ) .",
    "therefore the interaction of such amc with currents on a real antenna can not be completely constructive .",
    "for example , let the working frequency of the patch antenna correspond to the resonance of the conventional amc illuminated by a normally incident plane wave .",
    "then the narrow part of the angular spectrum of radiation centered at @xmath14 will interact with the amc as if it were a magnetic wall . for the other part of the angular spectrum",
    "the conventional amc is not a magnetic wall , since its resonant frequency will be different @xcite . in the amc",
    "used here this shortcoming is absent as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "notice , that in paper @xcite another full - angle amc has been suggested and studied .",
    "this is a self - resonant grid on a simple metal - backed dielectric layer .",
    "however , our choice of the artificial magnetic material suggested in @xcite has additional advantages .",
    "first , in this amm there are vertical conductors ( vias ) .",
    "we expect that the tm - polarized surface waves are suppressed in this structure at low frequencies due to the presence of vias in the same way as in mushroom structures @xcite .",
    "second , the resonance of the structure @xcite takes place at lower frequencies ( compared to the structure period ) than the resonance of the amc described in @xcite .",
    "both these advantages are important for patch antennas .",
    "the second one is important for the antenna miniaturization .",
    "the first one is crucial when one uses an array of patches and the problem of mutual interaction appears .",
    "the behavior of the amm is investigated at different distances from the patch antenna with different configurations .",
    "also a simple comparison method is introduced in order to find the effective ( averaged ) permeability value of the layer .",
    "results from ie3d / fdtd simulations are shown and compared with the measurement results .",
    "structure introduced in @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ cellnew ] .",
    "this amm can be considered as a 2d grid of bulk unit cells with the horizontal period @xmath15 .",
    "every cell contains two orthogonal loops of length @xmath16 , so that the upper interface represents an array of metal crosses on the surface of a dielectric layer .",
    "every cross ( whose ends are connected to metal vias ) together with vias and patches form two orthogonal loops ( the loop length @xmath16 is the same as the length of a cross side ) .",
    "so , the effective vertical loop is formed by two vias perforating the dielectric layer and a horizontal strip lying on the dielectric interface .",
    "the loading capacitors are formed by metal patches and the ground plane .",
    "the patch array is separated from the ground plane by a thin dielectric layer . the standard printed - board circuit ( pbc )",
    "can be used to prepare both patch array ( which is located on one side of a pbc ) and the array of crosses ( located on the other one ) if the thin layer has no metallization ( teflon film ) .",
    "the analysis of the structure impinged by a plane wave becomes easier with the help of the image theory .",
    "every real loop complemented by its mirror image is a symmetrically loaded rectangular loop with sizes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) .",
    "the electric field is zero at the loop center ( at the ground plane @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , the electric polarization of the loop is negligible and it can be considered as a horizontal magnetic dipole excited by an external magnetic field . following the image method , consider an array of loaded rectangular loops illuminated by two plane waves from both sides of the array",
    ". let the plane wave be polarized so that @xmath20 and the magnetic field is directed along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "then the loops in the @xmath22 plane are not excited ( see fig .",
    "[ cellnew ] ) .",
    "the whole structure behaves as an array of parallel loops lying in the planes @xmath23 within the dielectric layer excited by two plane waves coming from @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "since there is no electric dipole polarization of loops , the electric polarization of the whole structure is practically that of the dielectric layer .",
    "the reflected field is then the sum of the field produced by the single dielectric layer of thickness @xmath26 ( excited by two waves impinging the layer from the top and the bottom ) and the field produced by the magnetic moments of loops .",
    "the magnetization of loops is resonant due to the presence of capacitive loads , and the magnetic response at the resonance is comparatively strong due to high inductance of the loops .",
    "loops are made from thin electric conductors and their inductance is much higher than the effective inductance of the conventional amc ( which is practically determined by the thickness of the dielectric layer @xcite ) .",
    "this factor is responsible for rather low frequency of the resonance and for a wider bandwidth ( in parallel @xmath27-circuits the higher is the inductance the larger is the resonant band ) .",
    "an analytical model of this structure and a comparison with the results of numerical simulations ( obtained with the hfss package ) are presented in a recent paper by c. simovski and a. sochava @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the structure that we use in this paper is different from the structure proposed in @xcite , although the operational principle is the same .",
    "this new structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where square horizontal loops replace the conducting crosses of the structure @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , let us consider the normal incidence of a wave whose electric field is polarized along one side of the square horizontal loop .",
    "then the two vertical @xmath28-loaded loops ( formed by two sides of the horizontal loop , four vias connected to them and four capacitances between patches and the ground plane ) will be excited in every unit cell of the structure .",
    "a horizontal loop as such is not excited by the external magnetic field since this magnetic field is tangential .",
    "the electric connection of the two vertical loops does not change the operation and the theory developed in @xcite basically remains valid .    to realize the material a two sided tly-5 film with the thickness of @xmath29 mm and the dielectric constant @xmath30 has been used .",
    "this film separates small patches from the ground plane .",
    "horizontal parts of the loops and the patches are printed on the opposite sides of a printed circuit board layer with the dielectric constant @xmath31 .",
    "horizontal parts of the loops and the patches are connected by via wires ( round metal cylinders ) as shown in fig .",
    "the whole manufactured structure contains @xmath32 unit cells and has the dimensions of @xmath33 mm .",
    "this structure is a  brick \" from which larger samples of an amm can be built .",
    "test the performance of the new artificial magnetic layers with patch antennas we design and study square - patch antennas with different sizes . for measurements ,",
    "a large ground plane is used and for simulations the ground plane is infinite .",
    "this is done in order to exclude possible resonant effects of a finite ground plane .",
    "ie3d software as well as an in - house developed fdtd code are used to simulate antennas with and without the material filling .",
    "also , for the sake of comparison , we simulate the same antennas with an infinite dielectric material layer inserted between the ground plane and the patch .",
    "the dielectric has the relative permittivity @xmath34 and the slab thickness is @xmath35 mm ( the same as for the substrate used to manufacture the artificial magnetic layer ) . the antenna is fed from a side using a microstrip .",
    "the new amm is introduced under the patch gradually in order to save simulation time . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the configuration with three columns of the material under the patch antenna are shown .",
    "amm blocks are located at the two sides of the antenna symmetrically .",
    "antennas with the patch dimensions of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 mm have been considered .",
    "since patches of different sizes resonate at different frequencies from @xmath40 ghz to @xmath41 ghz , we could test the effectiveness of the material at different frequencies .",
    "the height of the antenna changes the field applied on the material which also changes the response of the material layer .",
    "the height of the patch antenna has been varied in order to find the best reduction for the resonance frequency . in these simulations , the @xmath38 mm antenna is chosen and only one column of the material is placed under each side of the patch . the return loss is compared for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 mm heights of the patch antenna ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the results show that the effect of the material is enhanced when the patch is closer to the material layer . here",
    "we of course see also the effect of the relative permittivity of the loading layer .",
    "if there would be no magnetic behavior of the material , antenna would be thought as loaded with a dielectric layer with @xmath45 and the thickness 3 mm . in that case",
    "the resonant frequency drops from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ghz for a patch antenna with the patch at @xmath42 mm above the ground plane . but with the magnetic material the resonant frequency drops to @xmath48 ghz . here , with only one column of the artificial material",
    "we have a @xmath49 reduction in the resonant frequency or , in other words , we have a patch antenna with a size of @xmath50 .",
    "when an antenna is totally filled with such complex material , it becomes very difficult to simulate it with ie3d , using the computer power we have .",
    "this is because the amc is made of a lot of small metal strips , patches , and vias .",
    "therefore we gradually fill the volume below the antenna .",
    "we start to fill from the sides of the antenna where the currents and magnetic fields are strong . here",
    "we investigate the effect when the antenna is partially filled .",
    "the number of columns is increased and the effect in return loss is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the @xmath38 mm patch . in this example",
    "the antenna patch is at @xmath44 mm above the ground plane .",
    "the same exercise has been repeated with the patch at @xmath42 mm above the ground plane .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "it is seen from the simulations that even with only one column we achieve a 16% reduction in the antenna resonant frequency for the patch at @xmath44 mm above the ground and @xmath49 for the @xmath42 mm height . with three columns we achieve about 25% and 33% reduction for heights 6 and 4 mm , respectively .",
    ".resonant frequencies of the @xmath38 mm antenna with and without amm for the patch heights @xmath42 and @xmath44 mm .",
    "the antenna resonant frequencies are also shown when there is an infinite dielectric material slab under the antenna patch with the @xmath35 mm thickness and @xmath45 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "an antenna with the patch size @xmath37 mm has been built .",
    "the patch is first positioned at 6 mm above the ground plane , then at 4 mm above the ground plane .",
    "it is filled with the artificial material layer of the dimensions @xmath51 mm ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) . the antenna in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] has also been simulated with a 3d fdtd code . in fdtd ,",
    "the particles are constructed from joint thin wires and small plates of approximately same size as in measurements ( within limits of finite cell sizes ) .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , the results are similar even though there are differences in the resonant frequencies .",
    "of course in simulations we have an infinite ground plane , and only three columns of the artificial material partially fill the antenna volume in the case of ie3d simulations . on the other hand , in measurements",
    "we have had a large but finite ground plane , and the material sample is of the same transverse dimensions as the patch .",
    "a new artificial magnetic material layer has been tested in order to shrink patch antenna dimensions . in simulations a @xmath52 antenna and in practice a @xmath53 antenna",
    "have been realized , with the 6-db bandwidth of 4.35% .",
    "the antenna bandwidth of these reduced - size antennas is practically of the same order as for usual air - filled patch antennas with the patch size @xmath54 , that resonate at the same frequency .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated in practice a technique to miniaturize patch antennas with the use of a certain high - impedance surface ( working as an artificial magnetic material layer ) without worsening the bandwidth .",
