    "veritas is an array of four 12 m diameter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona at an elevation of 1268 m @xcite . in less than 50 hours of observations",
    ", veritas can detect a source at the 1% crab flux level in the energy range from 100 gev to greater than 30 tev .",
    "the array can reconstruct events with an energy resolution of @xmath115% and an angular resolution ( 68% containment ) of @xmath10.1@xmath2 .",
    "for more details on the veritas instrument and techniques , see @xcite .",
    "the veritas capabilities are well suited to the study and search for blazars in the northern hemisphere and will become further enhanced once a planned move of one of the telescopes is completed later this year which will yield a @xmath115% improvement in sensitivity .        a large fraction of the @xmath1750 hours of dark time ( plus an additional @xmath1250 hours of moon time ) during the veritas observing season is dedicated to observing active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the focus of these observations is two fold : one , to study known vhe agn such as mrk421 or 1es 1218 + 304 to learn about blazar emission mechanisms , black hole accretion and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and , two , to discover new types of vhe blazars which will expand the current vhe blazar catalog and perhaps reveal unknown vhe phenomenon . for more details about the veritas blazar key science program ,",

    "the de - absorbed spectrum is calculated by applying the extragalactic absorption model according to franceschini , 2008@xcite.,width=240 ]    blazars are characterized by their double - humped spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and are further classified according to the location of the lower energy hump , usually interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "most of the @xmath125 vhe blazars detected by ground - based iact are high - frequency peaked bl lac ( hbl ) objects .",
    "veritas has discovered two hbl objects , 1es 0806 + 524 and , more recently rgb j0710 + 591 .",
    "in addition to these two hbl , veritas has discovered two intermediate - frequency peaked bl lac ( ibl ) objects , 3c 66a and w com .",
    "this contribution describes the discovery of vhe @xmath3-rays from these four blazars .",
    "there are several other contributions in this conference which will detail the veritas observations of known blazars , including multiwavelength ( mw ) observations and ebl studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery @xcite of the hbl 1es 0806 + 524 was made with a combination of observations from the commissioning phase of veritas ( 30 hours ) and full array time ( 35 hours ) .",
    "these observations resulted in 245 excess events corresponding to a detection at the 6.3@xmath4 level .",
    "figure [ fig:0806theta2 ] shows the distribution of the squared angular distance between the shower direction and the location of 1es 0806 + 524 indicating that this source is point - like . the photon spectrum shown in figure [ fig:0806spectrum ]",
    "is characterized by a power law with photon index @xmath5 between 300 and 700 gev .",
    "the integral flux above 300 gev is @xmath6 corresponding to 1.8% of the crab nebula s flux . assuming absorption on the infrared component of the ebl according to franceschini , 2008 @xcite , the de - absorbed spectrum is calculated to be @xmath7 . the veritas data together with simultaneous _",
    "swift _ observations in the uv to optical to x - ray energies was used to construct a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object .",
    "the sed is well fit by a pure synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) model @xcite . for more details on the multiwavelength observations of this object",
    "see j.  grube s talk in this conference @xcite .",
    "veritas discovered the first ibl in vhe @xmath3-rays , w com , in a flaring state in march 2008 @xcite ( see figure [ fig : wcomskymap ] ) .",
    "w com is a known @xmath3-ray source detected previously by egret in the 100 mev - 10 gev band @xcite .",
    "the flare , which lasted only four days ( see figure [ fig : wcomlightcurve ] ) resulted in a detection at the 8@xmath4 level .",
    "the significance of the full data set is 4.9@xmath4 .",
    "70% of the total excess was from the four - day flaring period and during the two brightest nights , w comae was observed at the 9% crab flux level . using quasi - simultaneous multiwavelength data ,",
    "the sed can be reasonably modeled with a simple one - zone ssc but this yields an extraordinarily low magnetic field value ( b = 0.007 g ) .",
    "a more natural set of fit parameters is obtained with an external - compton model indicating that the higher optical luminosity is likely providing a seed population of photons for inverse - compton scattering .",
    "a second vhe flare was observed from w comae in june 2008 wherein the flux was @xmath13 times brighter than the previous flare @xcite . for more details on this second flare ,",
    "see g.  maier s contribution @xcite in this conference .",
    "a multiwavelength campaign was triggered during this time and will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "interestingly , the vhe hbl 1es 1218 + 304 can also be seen in the field - of - view ( fov ) of the w comae observations which highlights the capabilities of off - axis observations with veritas ( see figure [ fig : wcomskymap ] ) .",
    "the ibl 3c 66a was discovered by veritas in 33 hours of observations resulting in a 21.2@xmath4 detection ( 1791 excess events ) @xcite .",
    "variability is seen on day time scales ( see figure [ fig:3c66alightcurve ] ) during a strong flare observed in october , 2008 . the observed spectrum is well - fit by a soft power law with an index of @xmath8 .",
    "the redshift of 3c 66a is uncertain .",
    "it was measured to be 0.444 based on a single line @xcite and there is a lower limit of 0.096 @xcite . if the measured value of 0.444 is correct , the softness of the measured spectrum could be completely due to ebl attenuation of vhe photons ( see figure [ fig:3c66aspectrum ] )",
    ". using the model of franceschini @xcite and assuming a redshift of @xmath9 , the de - absorbed spectral index is calculated to be a very hard @xmath10 .",
    "3c 66a lies only @xmath11 from the radio galaxy 3c 66b and care must be taken in identifying the source of @xmath3-rays from this region .",
    "recently , the magic collaboration reported the detection of vhe gamma - rays from the region in observations carried out in 2007 and claimed marginal evidence ( at the 85% confidence level ) for association with 3c 66b @xcite .",
    "however , the veritas data exclude the position of 3c 66b at the 4.3@xmath4 level ( see figure [ fig:3c66askymap ] ) .",
    "in addition to this , the measured veritas spectrum does not agree with that measured by magic .",
    "one explanation of the discrepancy in source localization is that 3c66b must have been considerably brighter in 2007 than 2008 , and similarly 3c 66a must have been considerably brighter in 2008 than 2007 .",
    "recently the lat instrument on the fermi satellite also observed bright emission in the mev - gev range at a level higher than that reported by egret .",
    "in addition , observations of the blazar were made by the _",
    "swift _ and _ chandra _ satellites .",
    "details of these multiwavelength observations will be the subject of a future paper and are highlighted in l.  reyes contribution @xcite .",
    "rgb j0710 + 591 was only recently discovered to emit vhe emission and is the fourth veritas blazar discovery @xcite .",
    "located at a redshift of 0.125 , veritas observed rgb j0710 for @xmath12 hours resulting in a @xmath13 detection from 140 @xmath3-rays corresponding to @xmath14 of the crab nebula s flux .",
    "a future publication will describe the veritas observations as well as multiwavelength observations from the _ swift _ , _ chandra _ and fermi satellites .",
    "a preliminary skymap is shown in figure [ fig : rgbj0710skymap ] .",
    "the preliminary observed spectrum can be described as a power law with photon index @xmath15 . while not as hard as 1es 0229 + 200 which placed the strongest constraints to date on the density of the ebl in the mind - infrared band , the moderately high distance and relatively hard spectrum of rgb j0710 + 591 confirms the constraints presented in @xcite .",

    "to date , veritas has detected more than a dozen blazars and has discovered vhe emission from four blazars : 1es 0806 + 524 , rgb j0710 + 591 w com and 3c 66a ( see table [ tab : blazars ] ) .",
    "the first two of these are hbl objects while the latter two are ibl objects .",
    "the discovery of 1es 0806 + 524 highlights the capabilities of veritas to detect low - flux objects while the detection of the two ibl objects opens a new window into the study of blazar populations in the vhe regime .",
    "additionally , the detection of 1es 1218 + 304 in the fov of w com provides an example of the ability to detect objects at the edge of veritas fov .",
