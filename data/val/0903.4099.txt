    "electroweak symmetry breaking is a central feature of the standard model , arising because the lagrangian mass squared for the higgs field is negative .",
    "however , interaction with a thermal medium rather generically raises the effective ( thermal ) mass squared of scalar particles , leading to high temperature symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "such symmetry restoration is expected in the standard model at temperatures of order @xmath2gev , which presumably occurred very early in the hot big bang .    such symmetry breaking in a gauge - singlet scalar field",
    "would automatically imply a thermal phase transition between symmetry - restored ( high temperature ) and symmetry broken ( low temperature ) phases .",
    "but the higgs field ( or fields ) transforms nontrivially under a nonabelian gauge symmetry .",
    "the notions of vacuum expectation value and symmetry breaking for such a scalar are only defined perturbatively , and there is no guarantee that there will be a phase transition associated with electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . in particular , within the minimal standard model at allowed values for the higgs mass , no electroweak phase transition exists @xcite .",
    "but an electroweak phase transition would occur in numerous phenomenologically interesting extensions of the standard model .",
    "such a transition is interesting cosmologically for a number of reasons :    * a first order electroweak phase transition might lead to electroweak baryogenesis @xcite , giving rise to the baryon number observed in the universe today .",
    "* a first order phase transition might produce primordial magnetic fields @xcite which might seed the formation of today s galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "* a first order electroweak phase transition might give rise to observable gravitational wave backgrounds @xcite in interesting frequency ranges for future experiments ( around @xmath3 hertz ) .",
    "there are two key attributes of the transition which are important in these scenarios .",
    "one is the strength of the electroweak phase transition ( for instance , the available free energy and latent heat as a fraction of the energy density of the electroweak plasma ) .",
    "this is determined by model parameters ( field content , masses and coupling constants ) which are not known .",
    "however we have developed the theoretical tools for determining the strength of the transition , given the model parameters @xcite .",
    "the other attribute is the bubble wall velocity , meaning the propagation speed of the interface between high temperature and low temperature phases , while the transition is taking place .",
    "this velocity is relevant to all physical consequences of the phase transition . in particular :    * electroweak baryogenesis scenarios seem to be quite sensitive to the bubble wall velocity @xcite .",
    "a slow bubble wall allows nonequilibrium conditions to exist `` in front '' of the bubble wall , in the symmetric electroweak phase where baryon number violating processes are fast @xcite .",
    "a thin , very fast bubble wall would provide a nonequilibrium environment only in the broken phase , probably making baryogenesis very inefficient .",
    "* gravitational waves are of maximum strength if the bubble walls are highly relativistic .",
    "slow subsonic bubble walls give rise to rather extended and smooth hydrodynamic waves , which should be poor sources of gravitational waves ( see @xcite for the hydrodynamics of transitions with finite bubble wall velocities ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bubble walls propagate ultra - relativistically and a nontrivial fraction of the free energy density of the plasma goes into their acceleration , it could give rise to very interesting gravitational wave signals .    in a first - order cosmological phase transition in vacuum @xcite",
    ", the energy density of the false vacuum is completely converted into kinetic energy of the bubble walls . as a result",
    ", the wall velocity keeps increasing and approaches the speed of light ( @xmath4 grows linearly with the distance a bubble wall propagates ) . either this behavior , or highly relativistic walls but with a terminal @xmath1 factor",
    ", have often been assumed in the gravitational wave literature @xcite . on the contrary , the electroweak baryogenesis literature has generally assumed that interactions with the plasma impede the bubble wall and keep its velocity subsonic , @xmath5 , as the rather limited literature computing the wall velocity suggests @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine under what situations the electroweak bubble wall can `` run away '' and propagate with macroscopic gamma factor @xmath7 , and when it more modestly propagates with @xmath8 . at the thermodynamic level ,",
    "we show in appendix [ the_appendix ] that runaway walls are logically possible under quite weak conditions ; but whether they actually occur depends on how much entropy is produced by the passing wall , which is a problem in the microscopic wall dynamics .",
    "however , the relevant physics is actually quite simple , and the right tools already exist in the literature .",
    "this paper could have been written more than 10 years ago .",
    "however we find that the results neither appear in the literature nor are well known by either community .",
    "generally , at the mean field level models without electroweak su(2 ) singlet scalar fields predict a second order electroweak phase transition .",
    "the transition in such a theory _ may _ be a so - called `` fluctuation induced '' first order transition ( as for the standard model with an unphysically light higgs field ) .",
    "we will show that the bubble wall never runs away in such transitions .",
    "on the other hand , theories with su(2 ) singlet scalars can in some cases provide a first - order electroweak ( su(2 ) breaking ) phase transition already at the mean - field level of analysis .",
    "this is true for instance in the nmssm @xcite ( though not for the mssm ) . indeed , as we discuss below , it is true already for the simplest extension of the standard model , a theory with an additional real singlet scalar .",
    "we will show the such `` mean - field first order '' electroweak transitions generically , but not invariably , have `` runaway '' bubble walls , with @xmath1 growing linearly with wall propagation distance .",
    "we present a simple criterion to determine whether or not such `` runaway '' will occur .",
    "specifically , the phase structure is determined by an effective potential @xmath9 which is the sum of a vacuum part @xmath10 and a thermal contribution @xmath11 .",
    "the transition occurs when @xmath12 has two local minima , a shallower `` symmetric '' @xmath13-minimum and a deeper `` broken '' @xmath14-minimum ; the exact criterion for how much deeper the @xmath14 minimum need be is determined by a bubble nucleation calculation @xcite . if replacing @xmath11 with its 2-nd order taylor approximation , where @xmath15 runs over all scalars which change vevs . ]",
    "@xmath16 removes the `` broken '' minimum or raises it above the symmetric one , the bubble wall can not run away .",
    "if , after this replacement , the `` broken '' minimum remains deeper than the symmetric one , then the bubble wall will run away .",
    "the rest of the paper derives and clarifies this result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:1looppot ]",
    "we review briefly how the 1-loop thermal effective potential arises .",
    "section [ sec : fric ] gives a simple derivation of the friction on the electroweak bubble wall when it is propagating ultra - relativistically with respect to the plasma .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] illustrates our result using a specific model ( a toy version of the nmssm ) , showing how to determine whether or not runaway occurs as a function of model parameters .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] presents some conclusions .",
    "there is also an appendix , which discusses the thermodynamic criteria under which runaway walls are consistent .",
    "our arguments will be based on the way that the thermal effective potential arises from the particles making up the thermal bath .",
    "therefore we start by reviewing this physics .",
    "consider for simplicity a theory of two real scalar fields @xmath17 with tree - level effective potential ( h , s ) = h^2 + s^2 + h^4 + s^4 + h^2 s^2 . at zero temperature",
    "we determine the vacuum configuration by seeking the global minimum of the potential with respect to @xmath17 . if , for instance , @xmath18 is negative but @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive",
    ", the global minimum will be at @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this toy model such a nonzero value spontaneously breaks the @xmath23 symmetry group down to @xmath24 .",
    "at finite temperature we must take into account , besides the energy density arising from @xmath25 , also the energy density of thermal excitations of these ( and any other ) fields .",
    "fortunately one may define a thermal contribution to the potential @xmath26 describing the free energy density of the plasma .",
    "the total potential @xmath27 describes the total free energy as a function of @xmath17 , and its minimum describes the most favored classical background .",
    "one efficient way to compute the thermal contributions to @xmath26 is differentially ( the tadpole method @xcite ) ; we compute the derivatives @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which can be integrated to recover the full potential . in particular , to compute the difference between @xmath26 and @xmath30 , calculate the change in all particle energies in changing the value of @xmath14 : = _ a ( e_p , h , a ) h = _ a h , [ eq : tadpole ] where the sum @xmath31 is over all fields ( for us , just @xmath17 ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the @xmath17 dependent mass squared for particle type @xmath34 . for a scalar field @xmath35 is the second derivative of @xmath36 with respect to the scalar field value ; for instance , in our toy model @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to this energy cost , there is a free energy cost associated with changing the particle occupancies @xmath38 from the values relevant at field value @xmath14 to those relevant at field value @xmath39 .",
    "but this free energy cost is quadratic in @xmath40 , since the equilibrium occupancies are a minimum of the free energy .",
    "therefore , if we treat @xmath40 as infinitesimal we may drop this term , and reconstruct the thermal contribution to the effective potential by integrating ",
    "_ provided _ we account for the way that @xmath41 and @xmath38 vary with @xmath14 as we integrate .",
    "often the particle masses @xmath42 are small compared to @xmath43 .",
    "then we can approximate @xmath44 in the second expression in with @xmath45 . in this case",
    "we can perform the integral : = _ a _ a = _ a which is trivial to integrate : ( h ) = _ a m^2_a(h ) + v_0(t ) , [ eq : meanfield1 ] with @xmath46 an undetermined ( and for us irrelevant ) integration constant . a slightly less drastic approximation , useful if @xmath47 but valid even if @xmath35 itself is relatively large , is to neglect the @xmath14 dependence of the particle masses in the expression for @xmath48 , replacing @xmath41 with @xmath49 : ( h_2 ) - ( h_1 ) _ a ( m^2_a(h_2 ) - m^2_a(h_1 ) ) .",
    "[ eq : meanfield2 ] this approximation is the same as determining @xmath50 by performing a 2nd order taylor series expansion of @xmath51 about @xmath52  provided that the potential is at most quartic , and particle squared masses quadratic , in the condensate values of scalar fields ( true at tree level in renormalizable theories ) . in what follows we will call this the mean field approximation to the effective potential . in our toy model ,",
    "if only the @xmath14 field takes a nonzero background value , the effective mass for the @xmath13 field is @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the @xmath13 field part of the thermal contribution to the potential , making the stronger approximation , would be @xmath54 ( plus a constant ) .",
    "the first term here is also a constant ; the second looks like a correction ( positive if @xmath55 ) to the @xmath14 field mass squared . at temperatures where @xmath56",
    ", there is a ( meta)stable minimum at @xmath57 and symmetry will be restored .",
    "often this mean - field approximation is insufficient .",
    "for instance , in this toy example it predicts that the phase transition should be of second order . continuing to treat @xmath58 , but being more careful to account for the difference between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , one finds a series expansion in @xmath61 : ( h ) = _ a - + ( m^4/^2 ) which can predict a first - order phase transition , as illustrated in figure [ fig:1order ] .",
    "since this transition is only first order because of changes in @xmath59 ( changes in the size of the fluctuations ) , it is called a fluctuation induced phase transition .",
    "there are two potentially significant corrections to this simplistic description .",
    "one is that it has treated thermal particles as free , neglecting their mutual interactions .",
    "these give rise to higher order ( `` two loop '' ) corrections to the thermal potential computed here .",
    "these corrections can be important in establishing the order and strength of a phase transition when it is second or weakly first order .",
    "second , there are subtleties in defining an effective potential if a scalar which may take on a vacuum value is a non - singlet under gauge interactions .",
    "fortunately , for the electroweak transition to be phenomenologically interesting , it must be relatively strong . in this case",
    "neither of these subtleties is very important and the one - loop treatment described here is generally adequate ( unless the vacuum theory is strongly coupled , in which case we have little to say ) .",
    "when an effective potential has two local minima , there are two possible phases and there can be a phase interface between them , where the field varies from one to the other value , illustrated in figure [ fig : wall ] .",
    "plasma particles approach the interface from either side .",
    "if the interface is not too sharp , particles follow classical trajectories in the wall background ( wave packets are well described by the wkb approximation ) . in the interface rest frame ,",
    "a particle s energy and transverse momentum are conserved , so the classical trajectory is given by = , = 0 = - = - .",
    "but @xmath62 , so = - . note that @xmath63 represents a net force on a plasma particle .",
    "the total force on all plasma particles , per unit surface area of the wall , is = -dz _ a f_a(p , z ) [ eq : fgeneral ] with @xmath64 the occupancy of species @xmath34 with momentum @xmath65 at distance @xmath66 from the wall .",
    "@xmath34 may be bosonic or fermionic and @xmath67 is in general out of equilibrium .",
    "this is the force on particles due to the scalar background ; there is an equal and opposite force on the background , which acts as a pressure difference restraining the motion of the interface .",
    "the wall also feels a force due to the vacuum potential ; @xmath68 , pushing the wall forward .",
    "therefore the total force pushing the phase interface forward is @xmath69 .    in general",
    "the occupancies @xmath70 are all out of equilibrium and it is a nontrivial problem to determine them , simultaneously with the interface velocity , shape , and tension .",
    "this is what previous literature has attempted to do @xcite .",
    "however , two limits are very simple .",
    "the first simple limit is a bubble wall at rest in the plasma frame @xcite . in this case ,",
    "energy conservation , together with liouville s theorem , imply that @xmath67 remains always in equilibrium .",
    "therefore becomes = _",
    "dh _ a f_a(e_p , h , a ) , with @xmath67 the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "this expression coincides with the expression we found earlier for the thermal potential difference between phases @xmath71 , so the total force on the wall is @xmath72 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath73 is defined as the temperature where the potential is equal in the two minima .",
    "therefore , at @xmath73 the forces are in balance and a wall at rest will remain at rest , as expected .",
    "the other simple limit is the limit we need in this paper ; a wall with velocity @xmath74 which is ultra - relativistic in the plasma frame , _",
    "i.e. _ , with gamma factor @xmath75 .",
    "in practice we will be interested in really macroscopic values @xmath76 , so in the following we make no qualms about strictly expanding to lowest nontrivial order in @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by analyzing what happens in the rest - frame of the bubble wall . in this frame",
    "the plasma is ultra - relativistic with velocity @xmath77 , which we take to point along the @xmath78 direction ( so the plasma - frame wall has positive @xmath79 velocity ) .",
    "the mean wall - frame particle energy is @xmath80 , which will always be enough , the statements here have only exponentially small corrections , @xmath81 , as opposed to the power ( phase space ) suppressed corrections one would expect if @xmath82 strictly . ] to allow the particle to pass over the wall , @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the mean momentum @xmath84 is so large that the wkb approximation is excellent and the reflection coefficients are exponentially suppressed .",
    "interactions or scatterings between plasma particles occur at a time - dilated rate @xmath85 ( times inverse powers of couplings ) and can be neglected .",
    "therefore the occupancies evolve undisturbed . also , the number of particles approaching the wall from the positive @xmath66 side is exponentially suppressed by @xmath86 .",
    "that means that the particles approaching the wall have received no signal that the wall is approaching , and are in equilibrium .    rather than integrate the pressure per length over the wall",
    ", we can directly compute the net pressure on the wall by summing up the momentum change of each particle which passes over the wall @xcite : - = _ a f_a(p , in ) ( p_z , in - p_z , out ) .",
    "[ eq : f2 ] here @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the _ incoming _ momentum and occupancy . but they will have exponentially small @xmath89 and so the error from their inclusion is negligible ; the same applies for @xmath90 which are positive but so small that the particle would reflect .",
    "] is what we would get by performing the @xmath66-integration in , keeping @xmath91 constant along a classical trajectory and taking advantage of the absence of reflections . since the wall is at rest and uniform in the transverse directions , both energy and @xmath92",
    "are conserved .",
    "together with @xmath93 , this makes evaluating @xmath94 simple : p_z , in^2 + m^2(h_1 ) & = & p_z , out^2 + m^2(h_2 ) , + p_z , in + + ( m ^ 4 /p^3 ) & = & p_z , out+ + ( m ^ 4 /p^3 ) , + p_z , in - p_z , out & = & - + ( m ^ 2/e^3 , p _ ^ 2/e ^ 3 ) , where in the last line we have used @xmath95 . the terms @xmath96 will be @xmath97 suppressed and can be dropped . therefore the pressure difference is = _ a ( m^2_a(h_2)-m^2_a(h_1 ) ) f_a(p , in ) + ( 1/^2 ) .",
    "[ eq : meanfield3 ] the integration measure and occupancies are covariant , @xmath89 are defined based on their symmetric phase ( @xmath98 ) values .",
    "the expression is covariant only if we identify @xmath99 since that is the energy which satisfies the mass shell condition in the symmetric phase , where @xmath87 is defined . ] and can be performed in any frame ; it is most convenient to do so back in the plasma frame .",
    "this shows that is identical to .",
    "therefore the backwards pressure on the interface in the limit @xmath93 is found by replacing the thermal effective potential @xmath100 with @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "this is the main result of this section .",
    "let us comment quickly on scaling .",
    "the density of particles increases as @xmath1 , due to lorentz contraction .",
    "but the mean momentum that each particle induces , in climbing the wall , goes as @xmath102 ( since @xmath103 ) , which explains why there is a finite large-@xmath1 limit .    as a check",
    ", we can repeat the calculation in the plasma frame .",
    "since the wall passes at the speed of light and purely in the @xmath104 direction , it leaves each particle s @xmath92 and @xmath105 unchanged .",
    "conservation is the same as energy conservation in the wall rest frame .",
    "] however @xmath106 must change by @xmath107 , which uniquely determines the changes to a particle s 4-momentum : ( e , p_z , p _ ) ( e+ , p_z+ , p _ ) . in computing the momentum transfer to the phase interface , we must remember to consider the flux of particles through the wall , not the particle density .",
    "the flux differs from the particle density by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "therefore the force per unit area is & = & _ a f _ a(e_in ) v_relative + & = & _ a ( m_a^2(h_2 ) - m_a^2(h_1 ) ) f _ a(e_in ) which is the same as .",
    "here we apply the above results to the simplest extension of the standard model which can provide a strong electroweak phase transition ; the model extended by one real singlet scalar field @xmath13 .",
    "this field need not have an @xmath109 discrete symmetry . if not , then @xmath110 and @xmath111 potential terms can appear at tree level , potentially leading to a strongly first order electroweak phase transition , as recently studied in @xcite .",
    "discrete symmetry , the @xmath13 particles are an interesting dark matter candidate @xcite . ]",
    "so consider the scalar sector of an extension to the standard model ; besides the complex doublet higgs field @xmath112 there is a real singlet field @xmath13 , with tree - level potential @xmath113 with @xmath114 we want to probe whether or not the bubble wall runs away in this model as a function of the parameters @xmath115 , and in particular we want to see how the wall velocity is correlated with the strength of the transition ( and possibly other attributes ) .",
    "to do so we perform a monte - carlo sampling over the values of the 7 scalar lagrangian parameters , fixing @xmath116 to give the right physical higgs vev . for each choice of scalar parameters ,",
    "we take a series of steps :    1 .",
    "first we must make sure that the parameters give a vacuum consistent with phenomenology .",
    "we enforce absolute stability of the theory , requiring @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "then we require that the higgs vacuum is deeper than any @xmath13-only vacua and that the scalar states in the higgs minimum obey experimental higgs mass constraints @xcite if @xmath120gev and @xmath121 if @xmath122gev . ] .",
    "we compute the thermal effective potential and place the following constraints on the minimum structure as a function of temperature .",
    "the @xmath14 minimum ( by which we mean any minimum with a nonzero condensate of the higgs field ) must become unstable ( become an inflection point rather than a minimum ) at some point as the temperature is raised ; we call this temperature where it suffers spinodal instability @xmath123 .",
    "then we require that the @xmath13-minimum which is stable above @xmath123 should become spinodally unstable as the temperature is lowered , at some @xmath124 .",
    "the latter condition ensures that the universe does not become trapped in an electroweak - symmetric phase as it cools .",
    "( the criterion is a little too strong ; we really only need ensure that the nucleation action to leave the @xmath13-phase for the @xmath14-phase is small enough at some temperature to allow the transition to occur .",
    "spinodal instability means the nucleation rate diverges , so it is a sufficient condition for this to occur . )",
    "+ we are mostly interested in the behavior around the transition temperature and in cases which are marginal between runaway and finite - velocity bubble walls . therefore we expect moderate scalar vevs @xmath125 , which allows the use of the high temperature expansion for the thermal potential , which we take to be @xcite & = & h^2 t^2 ( ) + s^2 t^2 ( ) + & & + - ( g^3 + ( g^2+g^2)^3/2 ) . [ our_pot ] here @xmath126 are the weak , hypercharge , and top quark yukawa couplings respectively ; all other terms arise from integrating out the scalars . note that this potential makes a few approximations , dropping the effects of debye screening and the cubic terms for scalar fields .",
    "it is not our intention to perform a state of the art analysis , and the dropped effects are not too important if the transition is relatively strong with relatively light scalar masses near @xmath127 , which is the case when the bubble wall is marginal between finite velocity and runaway with a transition strong enough to be physically interesting ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "+ since very weak transitions are physically uninteresting , we discard all transitions with @xmath129 from further analysis .",
    "3 .   we determine the critical temperature , where the @xmath13 and @xmath14 phases have equal free energy .",

    "so there is one bubble nucleation per hubble volume per hubble time .",
    "this is wrong ; one should define @xmath132 , which is the time it takes for the nucleation rate to change appreciably ; then one demands that @xmath133 so there are enough bubbles to fill the universe in the time it takes for the nucleation rate to change appreciably .",

    "the cusp in the left figure is at the @xmath138 value at the center of the critical bubble ; we used a straight - line extension from there to the minimum of the potential , so the path in the @xmath138 plane had a cusp at this point . ] naturally , in both cases they indicate that the @xmath14-phase is deeper ( preferred ) .",
    "the red curves are the mean - field potentials @xmath135 defined in the last section , which we can think of as _ non - equilibrium _ effective potentials .",
    "the value of the red curve at a given value of @xmath17 is the free energy cost per unit volume to force a phase interface to sweep through the plasma , if the phase interface changes the plasma from the @xmath57 phase to a phase with the given @xmath17 value . for values of @xmath138 where it is positive",
    ", it would cost energy to create a phase with these vevs if the phase is to be produced by an ultra - relativistic interface .",
    "where the potential is negative , there is leftover free energy available from creating the @xmath14-phase , which goes into accelerating the bubble wall .",

    "the vev @xmath14 will relax to the equilibrium value as the non - equilibrium state after the bubble wall passage re - equilibrates .",
    "the height indicated as @xmath140 in the diagram is free energy density available to accelerating the phase interface ; the height indicated as @xmath141 is free energy density lost to entropy production in re - equilibrating the system after the wall s passage .",
    "some results from our monte - carlo study of the parameter space of this toy model are shown in figure [ fig : montecarlo ] .",
    "the study shows , as expected , that weak transitions generally involve finite wall velocities , while strong transitions almost always require runaway bubble wall velocities .",
    "however a small subset of strong transitions ( as measured by @xmath142 , the relevant quantity for baryogenesis since it determines whether baryon number is violated after the transition @xcite ) have finite bubble wall velocities rather than runaways .",
    "these strong but non - runaway transitions occur when the potential between the two ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) minima is very flat .",
    "the figure also shows that , in these cases , there is also generally a light physical scalar state in vacuum , which must be nearly aligned with the @xmath13 direction in order to meet higgs search bounds .",
    "( the cutoff in @xmath142 at small values is imposed by our procedure since we discard very weak transitions . )",
    "the physical consequences of the electroweak phase transition depend on the propagation speed of the phase interface .",
    "theories with singlet scalars can have very strong transitions without requiring large couplings or violating the higgs mass bound , because the potential can already possess multiple metastable minima at the mean - field level .",
    "we show here that such strong mean - field type transitions generally  but not always  involve interfaces which propagate at virtually the speed of light , as occurs in vacuum transitions .",
    "however , in the mssm or other theories where the first order nature of the transition is fluctuation induced , the bubble wall can never run away .",
    "we provide a clean , simple criterion , valid at the 1-loop level of analysis , which determines whether or not bubble walls run away .",
    "specifically , one defines @xmath135 , the vacuum effective potential @xmath143 plus the quadratic - order taylor expansion of the thermal part @xmath51 of the potential about the high - temperature phase .",

    "this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "this appendix explores the thermodynamics which establishes whether runaway bubble walls are thermodynamically consistent .",
    "consider two phases , with pressures @xmath145 and @xmath146 ; the entropy density @xmath147 and energy density @xmath148 follow from @xmath149 . here",
    "@xmath145 is for the high temperature @xmath13-phase , @xmath146 for the low - temperature @xmath14-phase , so for @xmath150 we have @xmath151 .",
    "the phases are separated by a planar interface moving in the @xmath104 direction at the speed of light , with surface energy density @xmath152 .",
    "we work in the rest frame of the unburnt @xmath13-phase plasma ; the @xmath14-phase plasma fills the region @xmath153 and flows with forward velocity @xmath154 .",
    "the temperature of the unburnt plasma is @xmath155 , the burnt plasma is @xmath156 .",
    "we want to determine for what values of @xmath155 the interface gains surface energy density , @xmath157 .",
    "this problem has three unknowns ; @xmath156 , @xmath154 , and @xmath158 .",
    "we have two equations and one inequality with which to determine them ; conservation of energy and of @xmath66-momentum , and the positivity of entropy production .",
    "the equation of state provides the stress tensor in each phase : @xmath159 the index @xmath160 indicates which phase s equation of state is to be used . per unit time , the energy per area of phase 2 increases by @xmath161 , while the energy per area of phase 1 decreases by @xmath162 .",
    "these must be balanced by the momentum flows and the energy change of the bubble wall : & = & t_1 ^ 00 - t_2 ^ 00 + t_2 ^ 0z - t_1 ^ 0z + & = & _ 1 - ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 2 ^ 2 v _ 2 ) _ 2 + ( 1- _ 2 ^ 2 + _ 2 ^ 2 v _ 2 ) p_2 .",
    "[ eq : t00 ] similarly the @xmath66-momentum must be balanced : & = & t_1^z0 - t_2^z0 + t_2^zz - t_1^zz + & = & -p_1 + ( _ 2 ^ 2 v _ 2 ^2 - _ 2 ^ 2 v _ 2 ) _ 2 + ( 1 + _ 2 ^ 2 v _ 2 ^2 - _ 2 ^2 v _ 2 ) p_2 .",
    "[ eq : tz0 ] adding these yields a simpler expression : 2 = _ 1 - p_1 - _ 2 + p_2 .",
    "[ eq : simple ]    the total entropy of the system must also increase .",
    "the entropy density of phase 2 is @xmath163 ( the factor @xmath164 because of lorentz contraction ) and the volume increase of phase 2 per unit time is @xmath165 .",
    "therefore entropy increase requires _",
    "2(1-v _ 2 ) > [ eq : entropy ] where the rhs is the reduction of entropy stored by the shrinking @xmath13-phase .",
    "the bubble wall runaway is permitted if there is a solution with @xmath157 , so energy accumulates in the bubble wall rather than being lost .",
    "unfortunately two equations and an inequality are not enough to solve for the three unknowns @xmath158 , @xmath154 , and @xmath156 .",
    "if we somehow knew how much entropy is generated at the wall , we could replace with an equation and all variables would be determined .",
    "this requires some microscopic dynamics details , which are treated in the main text of the paper . here",
    "we will just determine under what conditions a runaway wall is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "that is , we can determine the domain of @xmath155 values where it is at least thermodynamically consistent for a bubble wall to run away .",
    "we do this by setting the entropy production to zero , which determines the bubble wall velocity : treated as an equality , becomes v _ 2 = , x = .",
    "then the remaining two equations determine @xmath158 in terms of the initial temperature @xmath155 .",
    "specifically , since the @xmath14-phase becomes more favorable as the temperature drops , we can search for the temperature at which ultra - relativistic bubble propagation first becomes thermodynamically feasible , which is where @xmath166 at zero entropy generation",
    ". then @xmath156 is determined from @xmath155 by using : @xmath167 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath155 is the value where the so - determined @xmath168 , @xmath169 will give a valid solution to .",
    "we evaluated this value @xmath155 for each set of parameter values in the toy model discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we also determined @xmath170 , determined by the criterion _",
    "1(t_reheat ) = _ 2(t_c ) . that is , @xmath170 is the temperature where the supercooled @xmath13-phase has the same energy density as the @xmath14-phase at @xmath127 .",
    "its physical importance is that , for slow bubble walls , if @xmath171 then the universe will heat back up to @xmath127 before the phase transition completes and there will be a period of mixed phase ; whereas if @xmath172 then the supercooling is enough to use up all of the latent heat of the transition without reheating to @xmath127 and no quasi - equilibrium mixed - phase situation occurs .",
    "surprisingly , we find in the toy model that in every case @xmath173 .",
    "that is , the criterion that ultra - relativistic bubble walls are thermodynamically consistent is in practice a _ weaker _ condition than the condition of sufficient supercooling not to reheat to @xmath127 .",
    "further , we find @xmath174 for all but a very small corner of the parameter space of the theory . therefore ,",
    "in the singlet - scalar model , supercooling proceeded below either temperature throughout almost the entire parameter space which provides a first order phase transition .",
    "the fact that many parameters give bubble walls which can not run away means that the production of entropy at the bubble wall significantly reduces the range in which walls run away , relative to what is thermodynamically consistent .",
