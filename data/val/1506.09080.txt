    "study of global observables of multiparticle production and their universality in different types of high - energy collisions is of a crucial importance for understanding the underlying dynamics of strong interactions .",
    "recently , the universality of multiparticle production in nucleus - nucleus and hadron - hadron collisions has been reported exploiting concept of centrality - defined effective energy employed for the data interpreted in terms of the approach of the dissipating energy of quark participants .",
    "this approach combines the constituent quark picture together with landau relativistic hydrodynamics and interrelates multihadron production in different types of collisions . within this picture one",
    "can successfully explain the scaling between the charged particle mean multiplicity in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions and the universality of both the multiplicity and the midrapidity pseudorapidity density measured in the most central nuclear collisions and in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "the universality of the multihadron production irrespective of the collision species , an intrinsic feature of the dissipating energy approach , is widely discussed nowadays .    in this paper , in the framework of the approach of the dissipating effective energy of constituent quark participants , or , for brevity , the participant dissipating energy ( pde ) approach , we extend the previous studies of the charged particle mean multiplicity to lhc energies . we show that the multiplicity energy dependence of head - on collisions is well described within the proposed approach . in addition , here we study the dependence of the multiplicity on the number of ( nucleon ) participants at rhic and lhc .",
    "we introduce a new scaling , referred to as the energy - balanced limiting fragmentation scaling , which allows us to describe the pseudorapidity density spectra independently of the centrality of collisions . using this scaling ,",
    "a complementarity between the multiplicities measured in head - on nuclear collisions and obtained from the centrality data is found .",
    "the study clarifies some differences of the centrality dependence of multiplicities measured at rhic and lhc .",
    "finally , predictions are made for the charged particle mean multiplicities in @xmath2 and heavy - ion collisions at the lhc .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the pde approach , as it is proposed in .",
    "this approach quantifies the process of particle production in terms of the amount of energy deposited by interacting constituent quark participants inside the small lorentz - contracted volume formed at the early stage of a collision .",
    "the whole process of a collision is then represented as the expansion of an initial state and the subsequent breakup into particles .",
    "this approach resembles the landau phenomenological hydrodynamic approach of multiparticle production in relativistic particle interactions , which was found to be in a good agreement with the multiplicity data in particle and nuclear collisions in the wide energy range . in the picture considered here ,",
    "the landau hydrodynamics is employed in the framework of constituent ( or dressed ) quarks , in accordance with the additive quark model ; for recent comprehensive review on soft hadron interactions in the additive quark model , see .",
    "this means the secondary particle production is basically driven by the amount of the initial _ effective _ energy deposited by constituent quarks into the lorentz - contracted region . in @xmath1 collisions , a single constituent quark from each nucleon is considered to take part in a collision , and the remaining quarks are treated as spectators .",
    "the spectator quarks do not participate in the secondary particle production , but they result in a formation of leading particles and carry away a significant part of the collision energy .",
    "thus , the effective energy for the production of secondary particles is the energy of interaction of a single quark pair ,   1/3 of the entire nucleon energy . on the contrary , in the head - on heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the participating nucleons are considered colliding with all three constituent quarks from each nucleon .",
    "this makes the whole energy of the colliding nucleons ( participants ) available for the secondary particle production . within this picture ,",
    "one expects the results for bulk observables from head - on heavy - ion collisions at the c.m .",
    "energy per nucleon , @xmath3 , to be similar to those from the @xmath1 collisions but corresponding to a three times larger c.m .",
    "energy ,  at @xmath4 .",
    "such a universality is found to correctly predict the value of the midrapidity density in @xmath2 interactions measured at the tev lhc energies .",
    "in addition , the multiplicity measurements in @xmath1 interactions up to tev energies are shown to be well reproduced by @xmath0 data as soon as the inelasticity is set to @xmath50.35 ,   effectively 1/3 of the hadronic interaction energy .",
    "this is in agreement with the dissipation energy picture where the structureless colliding leptons are considered to deposit their total energy into the lorentz - contracted volume , similarly to nucleons in head - on nuclear collisions . for recent discussion on the universality of hadroproduction up to lhc energies , see .",
    "combining the above - discussed ingredients of the constituent quark picture and landau hydrodynamics , one obtains the relationship between charged particle rapidity density per participant pair , @xmath6 at midrapidity ( @xmath7  0 ) , in heavy - ion collisions and in @xmath1 collisions :    @xmath8    in eq.([eqn1 ] ) , the relation of the pseudorapidity density and the mean multiplicity is applied in its gaussian form as obtained in landau hydrodynamics .",
    "the factor @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 . according to the approach considered , @xmath11 is the proton mass , @xmath12 , in nucleus - nucleus collisions and the constituent quark mass in @xmath1 collisions set to @xmath13 .",

    "the centrality is regarded as the degree of the overlap of the volumes of the two colliding nuclei , characterized by the impact parameter .",
    "the most central collisions correspond , therefore , to the lowest centrality while the larger centrality to the more peripheral collisions .",
    "the centrality is closely related to the number of nucleon participants determined using monte carlo glauber calculations .",
    "hence , the largest number of participants contribute to the most central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the centrality is thus related to the amount of energy released in the collisions , to the effective energy , @xmath21 .",

    "energy available in a collision according to the centrality , @xmath22 :    @xmath23    conventionally , the data are divided into centrality intervals , so that @xmath22 is the average centrality per centrality interval ,   @xmath24 for the centrality interval of 20%30% centrality .",

    "considering the limiting fragmentation hypothesis within the effective - energy approach , one expects the limiting fragmentation scaling of the distribution @xmath68 , which is measured at @xmath28 , to be similar to that of the calculated distribution but taken at the effective energy @xmath21 .",

    "energy is appealed to explain different centrality dependence of the data from the two colliders . similarly to calculations in , additional contribution from the fragmentation regions are shown to be needed at rhic . however",

    "meantime , the midrapidity pseudorapidity densities measured at rhic and at lhc do not show different behavior with centrality and are found to be similarly well reproduced by the pde calculations where no preference is given to midrapidity or fragmentation sources .",
    "there are other approaches , which also consider the three effective regions in pseudorapidity density distributions of charged particles produced in @xmath1 and in heavy - ion collisions . in the string percolation model , the fragmentation region",
    "is populated by strings of valence quarks and the midrapidity region by additional short strings between quarks and antiquarks .",
    "in other approaches , one introduces a leading particle activity within the hydrodynamic or thermal pictures of the multiparticle production processes . like in the pde consideration , presented here , a similarity of the mechanism of particle production in @xmath1 and heavy - ion collisions is also assumed in these approaches .",
    "whereas within the pde approach the leading particles resulting from the spectators are considered to be produced in nucleon - nucleon collisions , where a single quark pair interaction is assumed , no leading particle effect is implied for central nucleus - nucleus collisions , where the entire energy of the participants is considered to be available for bulk hadron production . as already noticed above , also no difference in the particle production sources in different pseudorapidity regions",
    "is assumed in the pde approach .",
    "then , the c.m . energy scaling due to the key picture of the constituent quarks , applied to the landau hydrodynamics , allows revealing the universality of the multihadron dynamics in hadronic and nuclear interactions .",
    "given the obtained agreement between the data and the calculations , and considering the similarity put forward for @xmath21 and @xmath28 , one would expect the measured centrality data at @xmath21 to follow the @xmath28 dependence of the mean multiplicity in the most central nuclear collisions . in fig .",

    "it is found to be similar to the power - law @xmath28-fit , eq .",
    "( [ expnaa ] ) , to the head - on collision data shown by the dashed - dotted line .    from this one concludes that within the picture proposed here the data are well reproduced under the assumption of the effective energy which governs the multiparticle production .",
    "this points to the the same energy behavior in multihadron production for all types of heavy - ion collisions , from peripheral to the most central collisions . here",
    ", let us stress an important corollary of the pde approach . as soon as the effective energy in nucleus - nucleus collisions determines the pseudorapidity density at midrapidity , then the midrapidity pseudorapidity densities at the same effective energy but at different c.m .",
    "energy get the same value .",
    "in other words , the densities are defined by the effective energy independent of the energy of the collision .",
    "the observation made here for the multiplicity dependence on the effective energy confirms the observation made earlier for the midrapidity densities , while it adds another important ingredient which takes into account the additional energy - balanced contribution to the mean multiplicity in noncentral nucleus - nucleus collisions .    from the hybrid",
    "fits obtained , we estimate the multiplicity for the future lhc heavy - ion run . since the hybrid fit for the head - on collision data and the fit to the centrality data show slightly different increase with c.m .",
    "energy , the predictions of the two fits are averaged .",
    "hence , the mean multiplicity @xmath98 value is predicted to be about 119 with 5% uncertainty in the most central heavy - ion collisions at @xmath99  tev .",
    "the prediction is shown by the right - inclined hatched area in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] .",
    "this value is close to the value of about 116 one gets from the alice fit and about 108 which one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ ln3 ] ) .",

    "the predictions are made as well for the centrality dependence and are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvsnpart ] .",
    "we give the predictions for @xmath101  tev , considering the recent measurements reported by alice for the rapidity density and expecting the mean multiplicity measurements at this energy .",
    "the two types of predictions are shown .",
    "first , similar to the above predictions made to the head - on collisions , we use the fit functions .",
    "as soon as , within the effective - energy approach , we treat noncentral collisions as central collisions at energy @xmath21 , then we use the head - on collision multiplicity fits to predict the centrality dependence .",
    "this is similar to that made for the existing data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvsnpart ] by the dashed lines .",
    "however , for the predictions , we use the average values of the hybrid and the power - law fits , eqs .",
    "( [ hybnaa ] ) and ( [ expnaa ] ) , as soon as those deviate for @xmath28 above 2.76  tev .",
    "the prediction for @xmath102  tev centrality dependence is shown by the dashed - dotted line .",
    "the centrality and @xmath62 values are alike in the 2.76 tev data shown .",
    "the expectations show an increase of the mean multiplicity with @xmath62 ( decrease with centrality ) from about 52 to about 118 .",
    "the increase looks to be slightly faster than at @xmath103  tev , especially for the peripheral region .",
    "second , the pde set of prediction is made using the calculations based on eq .",
    "( [ pmultc ] ) combining the constituent quark model and the landau hydrodynamics .",
    "this prediction for the centrality dependence is shown by the solid inverted triangles .",
    "one can see that the predictions are close to ones obtained from the head - on collision data fits .",
    "the predictions are compared with the lhc data at @xmath104  tev . to better match the predictions for highly central collisions ,",
    "the 2.76 tev data points are multiplied by 1.3 .",
    "one can see that the predictions are well reproduced by the scaled data .",
    "this indicates no change of the hadroproduction mechanism expected with increase of the c.m .",
    "energy at lhc , in contrast to what is seen as one compares the scaled 200 gev rhic data with the 2.76 tev measurements .",
    "an interesting issue to be addressed in the framework of the pde picture is asymmetric collisions , such as nucleon - nucleus ( @xmath105-nucleus ) ones . in these interactions",
    "the multiplicity is also expected to have no centrality dependence .",
    "this is due to the many nucleon - nucleon interactions of the incident proton with the nucleons of the interacting nucleus while the secondary particles produced in the reaction are assumed to be created out of the c.m .",
    "energy deposited to the interaction zone .",
    "the proton and nucleus are considered to interact via a single pair of constituent quarks , one from the proton and another one from a nucleon in the interacting nucleus .",
    "then , no centrality dependence of the multiplicity is expected in @xmath106-nucleus collisions with the multiplicity values to be similar to that from @xmath1 interactions at the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath107 . as a consequence ,",
    "this , at a given centrality , results in @xmath108 for the ratio @xmath109 .",
    "these features have been indeed obtained in @xmath110-au interactions at rhic . moreover , the effect of the @xmath62-dependence of the multiplicity ratio obtained at rhic has been also observed in hadron - nucleus collisions at lower @xmath111  1020  gev .",
    "these observations seem to be also obtained at lhc , where the dependence of the pseudorapidity density on @xmath28 measured in @xmath106-pb collisions at @xmath112  tev is observed to be consistent with a power - law @xmath39-fit to @xmath1 data and its centrality dependence is shown   to demonstrate the importance of nucleon - nucleon interactions for @xmath106-pb results .",
    "in summary , the multihadron production process in nucleus - nucleus collisions and its universality in nuclear and hadronic interactions are studied .",
    "the study exploits the charged particle mean multiplicity dependencies on the c.m .",
    "collision energy per nucleon , @xmath28 , and on the number of nucleon participants , or centrality , measured in the energy range of a few gev to a few tev .",
    "the study is carried out in the framework of the earlier proposed approach of the dissipating effective energy of constituent quark participants , or the participant dissipating energy ( pde ) approach . in this approach , the participants are considered to form the initial zone of a collision and to determine the production of hadrons at the very early stage of the collision . in this consideration one combines the constituent quark picture with landau hydrodynamics and interrelates the multihadron production in different types of collisions by a proper scaling of the c.m .",
    "energy of collisions .",
    "in particular , an energy - scaling factor of 1/3 in @xmath1 measurements is shown to reveal the universality of the multiplicity dependencies in nucleon - nucleon and nucleus - nucleus interactions .    in the entire available @xmath28 range of about a few tev",
    ", the energy dependence of the multiplicity in head - on collisions is found to be well described by the calculations performed within the effective - energy approach based on @xmath1 data .",
    "meanwhile , depending on the data sample , the calculations are found either to describe the measured centrality dependence or to show some deviation between the calculations and the data .",
    "for the rhic data , the deficit in the predictions is observed for noncentral collisions so that the predictions do not follow a constancy with the centrality as it is observed at rhic .",
    "the lhc mean multiplicity centrality dependence , however , is found to be well described by the calculations including the increase towards the most central collisions .    to clarify the observations , approach of the effective - energy of the quark participants",
    "is applied to the pseudorapidity density distribution measured in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the energy - balanced limiting fragmentation scaling is introduced based on assumption of the similarity of the fragmentation region of the measured distribution in the beam rest frame and that determined from the calculations by using the effective energy .",
    "the revealed scaling allows us to reproduce the pseudorapidity density distributions independently of the centrality of collisions and then to correctly describe the centrality independence of the mean multiplicity measured at rhic .",
    "moreover , this finding provides a solution to the rhic `` puzzle '' of the difference between the centrality independence of the mean multiplicity  the monotonic decrease of the midrapidity pseudorapidity density with the increase of centrality .",
    "the mean multiplicity is shown to get a fraction of additional contribution to account for the balance between the collision c.m .",
    "energy shared by all nucleons and the effective energy of the participants .",
    "however , the midrapidity pseudorapidity density is fully defined by the effective energy of colliding participants . given that the calculations made in the context of the proposed approach are considering central collisions of nuclei , an agreement between the calculations and the lhc data indicates that at tev energies the collisions seem to present head - on collisions of the participants at the c.m .",
    "energy of the scale of the effective energy .",
    "thus , no energy - balanced additional contribution is required even with a relatively small number of participants at tev energies .    based on the above findings , the complementarity of the head - on collisions and the centrality data is shown resulting in the similar energy behavior of the mean multiplicity measurements as soon as the data are considered in terms of the effective energy .",
    "a departure of the c.m . energy dependence of the data from the second - order logarithmic behavior to the power - law or higher - order logarithmic polynomial function one observes at the region of 1 tev suggests a transition to a new regime in nucleus - nucleus collisions at tev energies .",
    "interestingly , these findings made for a full collision rapidity range are similar to those drawn from the studies of the pseudorapidity density and the transverse energy density at midrapidity .",
    "this is also in accordance with the change of the multiplicity dependence on centrality which also indicates a possible change of the regime of multihadron production as one moves from the rhic to lhc energies .    the hybrid and the power - law fits are found to describe well the existing data on the charged particle multiplicity from @xmath1 interactions in the entire c.m .",
    "energy @xmath39 range up to the top tevatron energy of 1.8 tev .",
    "however , in this case no clear change from the power - law behavior to the quadratic log polynomial one is obtained in the multiplicity c.m . energy dependence . moreover , the predictions made here for the mean multiplicity for @xmath39 in the lhc energy range of 2.36 to 13  tev within the pde approach demonstrate a closeness between the predicted values and the lower - energy @xmath39 fit .",
    "one concludes that , in contrast to heavy ions , no change in multihadron production in @xmath2 collisions is expected up to the foreseen lhc energy .",
    "based on the results of the hybrid fits , the predictions for the charged particle mean multiplicity in head - on heavy - ion collisions at @xmath47  5.13 tev at the lhc are given .",
    "within the obtained complementarity of head - on collisions and centrality data , the predictions are made for the mean multiplicity centrality dependence to be measured .",
    "the soon - to - come measurements at the lhc are of crucial importance for further understanding of the multihadron dynamics .",
    "this will shed the light on the universality of the multihadron production process in different types of collisions and clarify the pde approach and the obtained energy - balanced limiting fragmentation which have been shown to successfully describe the features of global key observables by relating hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
