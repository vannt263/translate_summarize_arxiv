    "event arrival times were first converted to the solar system barycenter .",

    "these corrected data were divided into 32 phase bins and folded over a number of trial periods and a pulse period of @xmath28  s obtained .",

    "we next investigated the pulse phase dependence of the various features identified in the phase averaged spectrum .",

    "the same model as used to describe the phase averaged spectrum was fit to each of the spectra .",
    "inspection of the results revealed that the , the central energy of the fe  k line , and the widths of the two fe lines did not vary significantly with pulse phase , and so these were held fixed at the best - fit values given in table  [ tab : ave_fits ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase_dep ] shows the variations in the best - fit spectral parameters as a function of pulse phase .",
    "clear variations in all the parameters , except for the energy of the fe  l line , are visible .",
    "we note that the pulse phase dependence of the blackbody temperature seems to mirror that of the power - law normalization .",
    "it is unclear whether the observed change in the blackbody temperature results from an actual change in the underlying blackbody , or from e.g.incorrect modeling of the power - law continuum .",
    "any such effects are likely to be strongly phase dependent given the large variations in normalizations of the two components ( see fig.[fig : phase_dep ] ) , and we note that the observed change in the blackbody temperature occurs at pulse phases where the blackbody component is faintest .",
    "there is a strong similarity between the pulse phase dependence of the blackbody and 0.94  kev emission features ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_dep ] ) .",
    "this suggests that these spectral components are physically related .",
    "we have searched for any _ orbital _ phase dependence of this relation .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectra were accumulated over orbital phases 0.060.45 and 0.450.72 ( center of eclipse occurs at phase 0.0 ) .",
    "there is no significant difference in the behavior of the different fit parameters in the two data sets .",
    "the lecs results are consistent with the illuminated inner part of the accretion disk being the reprocessing site . in a model where the accretion disk intercepts a fraction of the hard x - ray beam ( which is then reprocessed ) a 180@xmath10  phase difference between the hard x - rays and the reprocessed x - rays is expected . if the disk is tilted with respect to the rotation axis of the neutron star the phase difference can be different from 180@xmath10 . since we find a @xmath1250@xmath10  phase difference , this is consistent with a `` tilted '' disk ( for a more detailed discussion see mccray et al .",
    "@xcite ) . a way to test",
    "this is to observe  at other @xmath6 .",
    "if the tilt of the disk varies with @xmath6 , as predicted by the precessing disk models ( _ e.g. _  gerend & boynton 1980 ) , the phase difference should change .",
    "unfortunately , both the _ bepposax _  observation and that of mccray et al .",
    "( 1982 ) were performed at approximately the same @xmath6 .",
    "we searched for a change in the phase difference using data obtained during the first and last 50  ksec of our observation ( i.e.  a total of @xmath112  ksec exposure time ) .",
    "we find a decrease of 11@xmath3050@xmath10   which is inconclusive , mainly due to uncertainties in the determination of the peak of the broad soft pulse .",
    "choi et al . ( 1994 ) find that the intensity of the 6.4  kev fe  k line is modulated in phase with the `` soft '' component reported by mccray et al .",
    "the lecs data is of insufficient quality to investigate this relation , due to the low count rate and penetration effects in the instrument ( cf .",
    "parmar et al .",
    "however , it appears likely that both the fe l and k lines exhibit a similar modulation , and thus have the same origin .",
    "kallman ( 1995 ) discusses fe l / k emission line ratios and mean line energies in photoionized gases .",
    "the line ratio depends on the shape of the ionizing continuum , the column density of the emitting material and the ionization parameter @xmath31 ( tarter et al .",
    "the mean line energies increase with @xmath31 , ranging from 0.750 to 1.29  kev and 6.40 to 6.95  kev for fe l and k , respectively .",
    "combining the calculations of kallman ( 1995 ) with the line energies and intensities given in table  [ tab : ave_fits ] and assuming a power - law continuum with @xmath2 in the range 0.51.0 allows @xmath31 and  to be constrained to be 10100 and @xmath32  , respectively .",
    "the blackbody component could be reprocessed emission originating at higher optical depths in the disk .",
    "if the reprocessing region is located at the magnetospheric radius of 3000  km , then the derived value of @xmath31 and the peak power - law luminosity of @xmath33 gives an  of only @xmath34@xmath35  for a beam opening angle of 0.1 ( @xmath36 ) .",
