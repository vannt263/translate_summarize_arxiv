    "the bulk of the x  ray emission in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is produced via comptonization of uv photons in the inner parts of the accretion flow close to the central supermassive black hole .",
    "the resulting power law spectrum is modified by a number absorption and emission spectral features due to the reprocessing of this primary continuum ( mushotzky , done & pounds 1993 ) .",
    "they are clear signatures of the presence of large amounts of gas characterized by different physical properties in the circumnuclear region .",
    "one of the most common spectral features is the so  called _ warm _ ( i.e. partially ionized ) _ absorber _ ( halpern 1984 ; pan et al . 1990 ,",
    "turner et al . 1993 ) .",
    "such a component has been found to contribute significantly to the opacity of the x  ray primary emission in @xmath1 50% of the seyfert 1 galaxies with column densities up to  10@xmath2 2 ( reynolds 1997 ) . in particular ,",

    "ray spectra of bright type 1 agns present a wealth of absorption lines ( e.g. collinge et al .",
    "2001 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2001 ; kaastra et al .",
    "2002 ) , which allow to infer a few remarkable conclusions : ( @xmath7 ) warm absorbers usually show a very complex structure , with multiple regions characterized by different ionization states , column densities and velocities ; ( @xmath8 ) the strongest features are due to he and h  like states of o , ne , mg and si ; in addition a blend of m  shell iron inner shell transition ( unresolved transition array or uta ) has been often detected in the range @xmath1 0.700.80 kev ; ( @xmath9 ) the observed blueshift of the absorption lines imply they are originated in an outflow with mean velocities in the range @xmath1 1002500 km / s .",
    "however , two important issues regarding the warm absorbers still remain open , i.e. : the exact location of the absorbing medium and the physical connection between the absorbing materials in the uv and x  ray band . a likely range of distances of the ionized absorbing medium from the central source is @xmath10 @xmath1 0.0110 pc ( krolik 2002 ; behar et al . 2003 ) .",
    "by correlating _",
    "hst _ and _ asca _ data crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that all seyfert galaxies with evidence of uv absorption also exhibit x  ray ionized absorption features .",
    "furthermore , some sources in which uv and x  ray absorbing components share the same outflow velocity space have been observed ( blustin et al . 2003 ; collinge et al . 2001 ; kaastra et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , no clearcut identification of an x  ray warm absorber with an uv counterpart has been reported yet ( see crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 for a review ) .    unfortunately , the sensitivity of current grating spectrometers allows us to analyze just a handful of very bright x  ray sources .",
    "therefore ccd cameras spectroscopy still represents the best available tool to deduce information about the physical properties of the gas in the immediate surroundings of the central x  ray emitting region for most agns ( i.e. those with a  1 mcrab 2 @xmath11 10@xmath12 . ] ) .",
    "we present here the analysis of an  observation of markarian 304 (  @xmath1 0.1 mcrab ) . + markarian 304 ( mkn  304 , pg2214@xmath13139 ) is a seyfert galaxy at @xmath0 = 0.066 . due to the presence of broad emission lines in its optical spectrum ,",
    "mkn  304 has been classified as a type 1 object ( osterbrock 1977 ) .",
    "@xmath14 spectroscopy of this source revealed the presence of strong bump in the uv ( clavel & joly 1984 ) , without absorption lines . on the contrary , a recent @xmath15 observation of mkn  304 ( kriss 2002 ) disclosed broad absorbing features ( with a velocity spread of 1500 km / s ) due to multiple ovi absorption components blended together .",
    "mkn  304 was discovered as x  ray emitting source by _ uhuru _ ( tananbaum et al .",
    "later x  ray observations of this source were performed by _ einstein _",
    "( kriss , canizares & ricker 1980 ) and _ rosat _ ( rachen et al .",
    "1996 ) : both reported evidences of heavy obscuration , with a very flat slope ( @xmath16 0.07 ) in the soft x  ray band .",
    "surprisingly , mkn  304 was not targeted by _",
    "asca _ and _ bepposax _ and , therefore , no further study of its unusual flat continuum was performed .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat _ @xmath17cdm _ cosmology with ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) = ( 0.3,0.7 ) and a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 ( bennett et al . 2003 ) .",
    "mkn  304 was observed by the european photon imaging camera ( _ epic _ ) on board the  space observatory ( jansen et al . 2001 ) between 2002 may 12 15:46:29 ( ut ) and 2002 may 13 00:56:34 ( ut ) . the observation was performed with the  camera ( struder et al .",
    "2001 ) operating in full window extended mode and with the  cameras ( turner et al . 2001 ) operating in full window mode .",
    "all the three  cameras were equipped with the `` thin '' blocking optical filters .",
    "the data files were reduced and analyzed using the standard science analysis system ( @xmath21 ) v.5.4.1 .",
    "we used the epchain and emchain tasks for processing of the raw  and  data files , respectively , in order to generate the relative linearized event files .",
    "x  ray events corresponding to patterns 012 ( i.e. single , double , triple , and quadruple  pixel events ) for the  cameras were selected ; for the , patterns 04 events ( i.e. single and double  pixel events ) were used .",
    "the subsequent event selection was carried out taking into account the most updated calibration files at the time the reduction was performed ( september 2003 ) .",
    "all known flickering and bad pixels were removed .",
    "the event lists were furthermore filtered to ignore periods of high background flaring ( see appendix a ) .",
    "after this screening process ( and taking into account satellite dead times ) the effective net exposure times for the _ mos1 _ , _",
    "mos2 _ and  detectors are 33.4 , 35.5 and 29 ks , respectively .",
    "no exposure is affected by pile  up .",
    "the peak of the x  ray emission is located at @xmath22 = 22@xmath2317@xmath2412.1@xmath25 and @xmath26 = @xmath1314@xmath2714@xmath2821.7@xmath29 , i.e. at a distance of 1.5 arcsecs from the coordinates of the optical nucleus of mkn  304 ( clements 1981 ) .",
    "this is consistent with typical attitude reconstruction uncertainties .",
    "since the cleaned _ rgs _ data did not yield enough photons for a meaningful spectral analysis , they are not discussed in the following .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from the final filtered event lists using a circular region of 24 and 21.5 arcsecs radius for  and , respectively , centered on the observed position of mkn  304 .",
    "backgrounds were estimated from source  free similar regions close to the source on the same ccd .",
    "response matrices and ancillary response files were generated using the rmfgen and arfgen tools in the @xmath21 software . since difference between the _ mos1 _ and _ mos2",
    "_ response matrices are a few percent , we created a combined  spectrum and response matrix .",
    "the  and  spectra were then fitted simultaneously .",
    "both spectra were grouped to give a minimum of 40 counts per bin in order to apply @xmath30 statistics . given the current calibration uncertainties and the detector sensitivities , events outside the 0.312 kev range were ignored in the  spectrum , while , for the , we retained the 0.610 kev band .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using xspec v.11.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "all the models presented in this section and in the following one include absorption due to the line  of  sight galactic column of  = 4.96 @xmath11 10@xmath31 2  ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the photoelectric absorption cross sections were taken from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "the quoted errors refer to the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. @xmath32 = 2.71 ; avni 1976 ) .",
    "we first fitted the  spectra with a power law model in the 212 kev band .",
    "this simple model yielded a very poor fit (= 469(256 ) ) and an extremely flat photon index of @xmath5 0.95 . indeed the convex shape of the data  to  model residuals suggests the presence of heavy obscuration .",
    "[ fig : ext2soft ] displays the results of this fit extrapolated over the 0.312 kev bandpass .",
    "the large deficit in the 0.52 kev band clearly indicates the presence of a strong absorption , while the systematic positive residuals at  0.6 kev may reveal an emission component in excess of the underlying absorbed continuum .",
    "fitting the data over the 0.312 kev band with a power law yielded a  = 2483(367 ) ( see model a in table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "we thus accounted for this ionized absorber component with the multiplicative * absori * model in xspec ( done et al . 1992 ) . in this model",
    "the state of the warm absorber is a function of the ionization parameter @xmath33 defined as @xmath33 = @xmath34/@xmath35@xmath36 , where @xmath34 is the isotropic luminosity of the ionizing source in the interval 5 ev to 300 kev , @xmath35 is the number density of the warm plasma and @xmath10 is the distance between this latter and the central source . in the fit solar elemental abundances were assumed and @xmath33 was left as a free parameter . on the contrary , we fixed the temperature of the absorber to t = 1.5 @xmath11 10@xmath37 k since the statistics did not allow to simultaneously and effectively constrain @xmath38 and @xmath33 .",
    "such a value of @xmath38 falls in the typical range observed for a warm absorber ( reynolds & fabian 1995 ; krolik 2002 and reference therein ) .",
    "we also performed a further set of fits assuming values of temperature in the range 5 @xmath11 10@xmath39 10@xmath40 k , from which turned out that the ionization parameter remains almost constant ( i.e. @xmath3 90100 ) to the variations of temperature .",
    "this fit ( indicated as model b in table  [ tab : results ] ) resulted in a dramatic statistical improvement i.e. at @xmath41 99.99% confidence level according to an @xmath42test once compared to model a , with a  = 617(365 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath43/@xmath44 @xmath1 1.7 remains unacceptable and a large absorption feature is evident in the soft portion of the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "the breadth and depth of this feature suggest the existence of another ionized absorption component with a different value of @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore the derived slope @xmath45 = 1.40@xmath460.04 is significantly flatter than usually observed in unabsorbed seyfert galaxies ( malizia et al .",
    "2003 ) and quasars ( piconcelli et al .",
    "2003 ) , i.e. @xmath47 @xmath1 1.9 .",
    "we then added another * absori * component in the spectral model .",
    "first we fitted the spectrum fixing the temperature of this new component to the same value of the previous one , i.e. t = 1.5 @xmath11 10@xmath37 k. the fit gave a minimum  = 477(363 ) , with a statistical improvement significant at @xmath41 99.99 confidence level .",
    "however , an even better @xmath43 value ( @xmath43 = 441 ) was obtained fixing the temperature of the second ionized component to a lower value , in particular with t = 3 @xmath11 10@xmath48 k. the resulting spectral parameters of this fit ( model c ) are also listed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the @xmath43 value was reduced by @xmath32 = 176 respect to model b , thus the addition of the low - temperature ionized absorption term is significant at a level larger then 99.99% confidence level ( @xmath42test value = 72 ) .",
    "however the reported value of @xmath43/@xmath44 = 1.22 ( null hypothesis probability 0.003 ) is not yet very satisfactory and positive systematic residuals are still present in the data  to  model ratio below 1 kev .         in the reduction of the mkn  304 data ,",
    "we thus apply the following alternative procedure ( `` maxsnr '' hereafter ) to reject the high background level periods .",
    "the underlying idea basically consists of filtering out just those time intervals for which the count rate of the background reach values so high that the snr of the source does not significantly improve ( or even worses ) by including such time intervals in the analysis . to this aim ,",
    "lightcurves of the source and background region , i.e. a proper annulus around the source large enough to provide a good estimation of the background ( with a 120 arcsec radius in the case of mkn  304 ) , are extracted in the energy band for which the snr should to be maximized . in the analysis of mkn  304 data , we have taken into account the 0.51.3  kev ( 0.61.3 kev ) band for ( ) in order to optimize the snr in the band where most of the prominent warm absorber features are located .",
    "lightcurve datapoints for the source and background are sorted for increasing values of the cr of the background region . the cumulative signal  to  noise ( snr@xmath50 ) distribution function is then calculated .    the snr@xmath50 as a function of the increasing background cr builds a curve which monothonically rises up to a peak . after this maximum value ,",
    "the snr@xmath50 distribution indeed flattens or even decreases .",
    "this value is the threshold used to reject the high background periods .",
    "in fact , if included , these periods would not provide any significant improvements to the final snr of the spectrum of the source , but it would increase the background contribution to the raw source spectrum .",
    "this method to filter out high background periods optimizes the duration of the observation useful for a meaningful scientific analysis on the basis of the ratio between the count rates of source and background .",
    "it appears particularly appealing in the case of bright source for which an even `` flaring '' background can represent just a negligible fraction of their cr .",
    "it also has the advantage that the filtering is performed in a particular energy band ( chosen _ a priori _ ) where the snr need be maximized for the accurate study of peculiar spectral features .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] lists the final values of exposure , total counts in the 0.312 kev band , countrate and snr for the @xmath51 camera obtained using the `` maxsnr '' method compared to those derived from the application of the `` standard '' method .",
    "in particular , the method presented here yields a number of counts which is about 5.5 times larger than that resulted from the `` standard '' method .",
    "[ fig : snr ] shows the comparison between the spectra obtained using the two filtering procedures : the higher quality of the  spectrum provided by the `` maxsnr '' method is clearly evident ."
