    "it is standard to interpret cosmological observations simply with the spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models . since the universe is not exactly spatially homogeneous and isotropic , it is not _ a priori _ clear that this is a valid approach .",
    "however , it was argued in @xcite that flrw light propagation relations should be approximately valid for average observations in spacetimes exhibiting compensation of inhomogeneities along light rays .",
    "such considerations have later been studied more thoroughly in @xcite , with the conclusion being that average observations should be well described by the volume averaged dynamics and geometry in ( spatially ) statistically homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with structures evolving slowly compared to the time it takes a light ray to pass through them , _ if _ light samples spacetime fairly . under these requirements , and to the extent that cosmic backreaction ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and a possible local inhomogeneity can be neglected , it is then valid to use flrw models to interpret observations . however , the requirement of tracing spacetime fairly is not necessarily fulfilled for observations involving point - like sources such as supernovae ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the requirement _ is _ on the other hand expected to be fulfilled for observations related to sources with large angular extent such as the cmb @xcite . as pointed out in _",
    "@xcite , analyses of cmb observations depend crucially on the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface , @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore important to know if there are small systematic shifts in the redshift - distance relation in inhomogeneous spacetimes fulfilling the above listed requirements , compared to the relation obtained using the volume averages of such spacetimes ( which correspond to flrw models when backreaction can be neglected ) .",
    "studies involving both perturbation theory @xcite , n - body simulations @xcite and exact , inhomogeneous solutions to einstein s equations ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) imply that small shifts in the average value of @xmath4 due to inhomogeneities indeed occur .",
    "however , as discussed in _ e.g. _ @xcite",
    ", this shift in @xmath3 is already included in standard analyses of the cmb based on perturbation theory .",
    "this conclusion is only valid to the extent that a small average shift in @xmath3 actually is described adequately by perturbation theory .",
    "it is in this respect important to acknowledge that perturbation theory is only an approximation scheme and that subtle effects important for precision cosmology may be beyond its reach .",
    "this makes it important to test results obtained with perturbation theory to make sure that they are actually true for spacetimes exhibiting , especially nonlinear , structure formation .",
    "one tool for performing such tests is swiss cheese models based on the spherically symmetric lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) @xcite structures glued together in areas where they have reduced to flrw  backgrounds \" representing the volume averages of the given swiss cheese models .",
    "these ( toy-)models give a description of spacetimes with energy - density fluctuations on well - defined average flrw backgrounds and can thus be considered as describing  exact perturbations \" on flrw backgrounds .",
    "this makes swiss cheese models based on ltb structures excellent for testing perturbative results . by using swiss cheese models based on ltb structures",
    ", it has been found that there are no large shifts in the average redshift - distance relation except as selection effects arising when only special light rays in a given spacetime are considered ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite vs. @xcite ) .",
    "a noticeable exception is @xcite where a @xmath5 shift in the average redshift - distance relation compared to that computed using volume averaged quantities was found at @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is not entirely clear to what extent this large shift is related to the occurrence of surface layers in the studied model .",
    "results based on swiss cheese models with ltb structures _ should _ be in line with perturbation theory ; it has been shown with direct comparisons that perturbation theory based on ( semi-)nonlinear ltb density fields and the corresponding exact velocity fields reproduces exact light propagation in ltb models very well @xcite ( see also @xcite for the relation between ltb models and perturbation theory ) .",
    "an important factor for the impressive reproductions of light propagation in ltb models with perturbation theory in @xcite is the spherical symmetry of the ltb models ; the reproduction is inhibited for anisotropic szekeres structures because the method employed for obtaining velocity fields leads to artificial non - vanishing peculiar velocity fields outside non - spherically symmetric structures .",
    "that is , the method leads to non - vanishing peculiar velocity fields in regions where the exact anisotropic szekeres models have reduced to flrw models and hence should not give rise to peculiar velocity fields .",
    "this is unfortunate since real structures are not exactly spherically symmetric , making it important to know if spherical symmetry is essential for the agreement between swiss cheese and perturbative results .",
    "it is in this respect notable that anisotropic szekeres models exhibit structure formation that deviates significantly from both that of the underlying ltb models and from predictions of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is very clear from figure 7a in @xcite that light propagation is significantly affected by anisotropy ; in that figure , it is seen that an initially radial light ray following an exact geodesic of an anisotropic szekeres model moves through a significantly different density field than a light ray traced simply by using the born approximation .",
    "such a result is not possible for light rays in ltb models since the spherical symmetry dictates that an initially radial light ray remains so .",
    "the above considerations imply an importance of studying whether the anisotropy of quasi - spherical szekeres structures affects average observations of _",
    "e.g. _ the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering .",
    "however , while there are ample studies involving light propagation in ltb models , only few studies involve observations in swiss cheese models based on anisotropic szekeres structures . in fact , only a single study of average observations in swiss cheese models based on szekeres models seems to exist , namely @xcite .",
    "the results from that paper indicate a small average shift in the angular diameter distance compared to the background value .",
    "the study in @xcite uses an ensemble average which is typical of swiss cheese studies with an important exception being @xcite where line - of - sight averages are used .",
    "as shown in @xcite ( see _ e.g. _ also @xcite ) , second order perturbation theory predicts that ensemble averages lead to a positive shift in the angular diameter distance while line - of - sight averages lead to a negative shift ( with the shift defined as @xmath7 such that a negative shift corresponds to image magnification , and a positive to demagnification ) . in partial contradiction to this , positive shifts are obtained in both @xcite and @xcite , where the shift is , however , not statistically significant in the former .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the ensemble average of the magnification @xmath8 is equal to 1 while its inverse averages to 1 upon line - of - sight averages @xcite .",
    "these results hold at least to second order in perturbation theory , insofar that perturbations to the areas of constant - redshift surfaces are negligible ( which is generally assumed to be the case ) .",
    "however , the study in @xcite finds a low probability of an average @xmath9 equal to @xmath2 while the erratum to @xcite describes a good agreement with an average value of @xmath9 of 1 . in summary",
    ", the studies of average light propagation in swiss cheese models do not seem to be entirely consistent with neither each other nor with perturbation theory .",
    "the swiss cheese models used in @xcite and @xcite differ from each other in significant ways aside from the anisotropy issue .",
    "hence , a comparison between the results in those two papers can not yield much insight into the possible effects anisotropic structure formation has on observations .",
    "the purpose with the work presented here is to obtain such information , _",
    "i.e. _ the study presented here is concerned with determining if the anisotropy of quasi - spherical szekeres structures affects observations such as @xmath3 and whether or not the anisotropy of the szekeres models influences ( dis-)agreement with perturbative results .",
    "the study is conducted by constructing four different swiss cheese models that only differ in the shape of their individual structures .",
    "the structures in two of the models are anisotropic szekeres structures , while their underlying ltb models are used for constructing the other two . by studying swiss cheese models with both anisotropic structures and their  underlying \" spherically symmetric structures",
    ", it is possible by direct comparisons to quantify effects of anisotropy . besides computing the average of @xmath3 in each of the models , the density , the distance - redshift relation ,",
    "the shear and the expansion rate along individual rays are also studied .",
    "this section serves to introduce the szekeres models and specify the particular models used in this study .",
    "in addition , a brief description of the construction of swiss cheese models is given .",
    "the quasi - spherical szekeres models @xcite are exact , inhomogeneous dust solutions to einstein s equations which can easily incorporate a homogeneous component with pressure @xcite such as a cosmological constant . in general , the quasi - spherical szekeres models have no killing vectors @xcite and hence no symmetries . their line element can be written as : @xmath10 subscripted commas followed by a coordinate or its index indicates partial derivative with respect to that coordinate .",
    "the metric function @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are continuous but otherwise arbitrary functions of @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath17 , @xmath14 and @xmath18 represent dipole distortions of the spacetimes of  underlying \" spherically symmetric ltb models .",
    "if they are chosen to be constant , the particular quasi - spherical szekeres model reduces to such an underlying ltb model .",
    "in addition , the quasi - spherical szekeres models have the flrw models as their homogeneous and isotropic limit . the flrw limit is achieved by setting @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the scale factor of the flrw model . in the following",
    ", quasi - spherical szekeres models will be referred to simply as szekeres models .",
    "since ltb models are also strictly speaking szekeres models , szekeres models which are specifically not spherically symmetric are sometimes referred to as anisotropic szekeres models . for a szekeres metric combined with dust and a cosmological constant ,",
    "the diagonal components of einstein s equation yield ( @xmath23 denotes newton s constant ) : @xmath24 @xmath25 the curvature function , @xmath26 , and the integration constant , @xmath27 , both depend on the radial coordinate only while @xmath28 depends on both @xmath15 and @xmath29 .",
    "the top equation is also valid for ltb models , while the expression for the density in the ltb limit reduces to @xmath30 because @xmath31 in the limit of spherical symmetry .",
    ".specification of anisotropic szekeres models and their underlying ltb models . @xmath32 and @xmath33 specify @xmath34 and hence the ltb models while @xmath35 and @xmath36 specify the functions @xmath37 of the anisotropic szekeres models .",

    "light propagation in four swiss cheese models only differing in terms of the shapes of their individual structures was studied . in particular , the redshift - distance relation , shear and expansion rate were studied along light rays initialized equivalently in the four models . despite the anisotropies of the szekeres models , light rays initialized equivalently in the four models were all found to travel through equivalent portions of spacetime . the angular diameter distance along light rays in two of the models , models sz2 and ltb2 , deviate significantly less from the background value than in the other two models , models sz1 and ltb1 .",
    "this is consistent with the much more prominent density contrasts in the latter two models . while the angular diameter distance along equivalent light rays in models sz1 and ltb1 are similar , there is a noticeable difference between the angular diameter distances computed along the equivalent light rays of models sz2 and ltb2 .",
    "this can presumably be attributed the particular anisotropies in the structures of models sz1 and sz2 .",
    "analogous similarities were found for the expansion rate and projected shear along the light rays .",
    "in addition , the integrals of the projected shear and of the fluctuations in the expansion rate along the light rays were found to cancel with each other to a high precision .",
    "this was also found in @xcite and it would be interesting to learn if it is a particular feature of szekers / ltb models or if the feature persists for a larger group of spacetimes .",
    "the line - of - sight average of the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering , @xmath38 , was computed using @xmath39 light rays for each model .",
    "for the two models with largest energy - density fluctuation amplitudes , @xmath38 was found to be of order @xmath40 .",
    "for the two other models it was two orders of magnitude smaller . for three of the four models ,",
    "the shift was found to be negative .",
    "this is in agreement with perturbative results found in @xcite . even in the single case of a positive average @xmath38",
    ", the result can not be claimed to be in discordance with perturbation theory since the result has a very low statistical significance .",
