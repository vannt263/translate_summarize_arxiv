    "the size reduction of devices in microelectronics , and the fundamental limitations encountered or anticipated due to quantum mechanical effects , have turned attention to understanding nanometer scale structures . systems where intrinsic quantum mechanical effects can play an important role and could even be used to advantage are under intense scrutiny .",
    "one recent prominent example of such systems are quantum dot cellular automata .",
    "the original concept of  cellular automata \" was introduced as @xmath0-dimensional arrays containing finite amplitude ( information ) per cell ( or site ) and connected to one another according to certain rules .",
    "this simple definition , however , governs the evolution of the entire array in rather complex ways . @xcite _ quantum _ cellular automata are a natural generalization of this concept , where each site contains a quantum mechanical probability amplitude.@xcite in 1993 , lent and coworkers , @xcite proposed the use of cellular automata architectures , composed of nanometer - scaled quantum devices ( quantum dots ) coupled through carefully chosen hopping and coulomb interactions , to encode _ classical _ binary information in the different charge configurations of the system .",
    "the typical basic element in these _ quantum - dot cellular automata _ ( qca ) is a cell consisting of four quantum dots ( qd ) located at the vertices of a square and connected via tunneling barriers to their neighbors ( see fig .",
    "[ modelo]a ) . for two mobile electrons in each four - dot cell ,",
    "coulomb repulsion between the electrons causes the charge in the cell , in the ground state , to align along either of the two diagonals .",
    "the symmetrical arrangement of the system means that these two `` polarization '' states are degenerate and can be used to represent logic @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the bits in this system .",
    "the degeneracy is split by an appropriately designed driver field which allows control of the polarization of the ground state ( and typically implemented as a second identical cell with externally controlled polarization ) .",
    "tunneling barriers between dots are designed in such a way that intra - cell tunneling is possible , but _",
    "inter_-cell tunneling is not , and only coulomb interaction from cell to cell is possible .",
    "elemental cell designs have been experimentally realized using metal islands , and logic operations and , or and not have been implemented using arrays of such cells suitably arranged .",
    "@xcite also , a clever implementation of qca using magnetic elements has been recently reported .",
    "@xcite     for a target cell with driver at + 1 .",
    "energy in units of @xmath3 mev , and @xmath4 .",
    "sketch at bottom : model qca with four quantum dots per cell .",
    "two charges are allowed to tunnel between nearest neighbors , with probability @xmath5 .",
    "driver cell on right indicates a state with polarization @xmath6 .",
    "( b ) level structure vs.  dot size asymmetry @xmath7 .",
    "notice anticrossings for @xmath8 and 0.2 in excited states .",
    "separation to driver , @xmath9 in both panels.,width=345 ]    although originally proposed as ` classical ' and near dissipationless bit operators , qca could in principle also be used to implement a quantum computer , as discussed recently , @xcite if the entire array system is coherent enough ( and for sufficiently long times ) . in either the classical or quantum operation mode , qca computers ( as well as any other ) should keep errors to a manageable limit .",
    "of special significance in these systems , decoherence and dissipation are external sources of ` error ' originating in the coupling between the system and its surroundings .",
    "other aspects that have to be considered as possible sources of loss of control or desirable operation are imperfections in the dot fabrication , stray charged impurities , and the role of switching fields or drivers .",
    "it is then of interest to study the dynamical evolution of the qca and monitor the charge density distribution over the basic cell elements under the influence of a driver cell , with emphasis on the effects of imperfections and dissipation .",
    "the charge configuration is conveniently monitored through lent s cell _ polarization _ ,",
    "@xcite which is essentially a measure of the degree of alignment of the charges along the diagonals of the square cell : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the charge density at site @xmath12 ( see fig.[modelo]a ) , and the numbering of the sites is in clockwise order . in previous works , the effect of dissipation on qca has been included in the quantum equations of motion in a phenomenological way , @xcite through a damping parameter .",
    "this model is shown to give qualitatively correct results only in the low temperature limit , as it will be evident in our calculations .",
    "also , the temperature dependence of the cell polarization has been studied for the case of a cell composed of two coulomb - coupled double dots , @xcite and the contribution of relaxation processes to the speed of the cell response was discussed using stochastic equations for the population differences and dipole moments of the double dots .",
    "the effects of imperfections have been considered before , with @xcite and without @xcite dissipation , and found to have strong effects in the dynamical response , by delaying or slowing down the response of the target cell , and producing a less than optimal desired polarization . in this paper",
    ", we include the important effect of the environment through a microscopic model of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the thermal bath is modelled with phonons in equilibrium at a given temperature and structural asymmetries are introduced via size variations of the quantum dots .",
    "we should point out that in addition to their relevance as a new computational paradigm , qca arrays provide a conceptually simple , yet intricate and subtle , quantum mechanical system in which to study fundamental coherence and dissipative processes .",
    "the parametrical requirements to make practical qca devices yield a finite set of two - particle states which can be manipulated to yield insights into the loss of coherence in these and general quantum systems . as such , qca provide then a model condensed matter system where dynamics and decoherence can be explored in detail . to this effect",
    ", we use a quantum open systems approach @xcite to study the dynamical evolution of the _ reduced density matrix _ @xmath13 of the system , and evaluate the competition between coherent ( driver cell ) and incoherent ( thermal bath ) field effects in the response of the basic cell .",
    "we study the effects of temperature , electron - phonon coupling intensity , and structural asymmetry on the behavior of the polarization as a function of time .",
    "in particular , we discuss the asymptotic polarization after switching events , and once the driver is in a stationary configuration , for different temperatures and structure parameters .",
    "an analysis of asymptotic fixed points in the resulting dynamics provides information on the system , as we will explicitly demonstrate and discuss later on .    a measure of the mixed character of a system described by a density matrix @xmath14 is provided by the _ linear entropy _ , @xmath15=tr\\{\\hat\\rho-\\hat\\rho^2\\}$",
    "@xcite this quantity , which can be thought of as the lowest order approximation to the von neumann entropy , is also called the _ idempotency defect _ or the _ purity _ of a state . notice",
    "that the linear entropy is zero for a pure state , since @xmath16 in that case .",
    "non - zero values of @xmath15 $ ] provide then a quantitative measure of non - purity of the state of a system . when monitored in time",
    ", the linear entropy provides a convenient measure of how fast the loss of quantum purity occurs in a system in contact with a bath , or the _ increase _ in coherence under appropriate ` pumping ' conditions , as we will discuss below .",
    "other uses of @xmath15 $ ] include the study of quantum manifestations of chaotic behavior in a complex system .",
    "@xcite we explore the influence of temperature , electron - phonon coupling intensity and driver cell switching times on @xmath15 $ ] , in order to understand the process of dissipation in the qca system .",
    "we find in all cases that high dissipation and asymmetry influence adversely the response of the basic cell , as one would intuitively anticipate .",
    "however , the behavior with temperature is quite subtle . for example",
    ", low temperature results in better switching and more faithful following of the driver by the target cell .",
    "higher temperatures eventually produce quenching of the polarization and a dynamical evolution which basically ignores the driver . on the other hand , size defects in the dots",
    "result in lagging of the switching behavior with respect to the driver , and a faster switching window .",
    "this is produced by the pinning of a given polarization state by the energetics of the size defect , so that the driver potential has to apply a strong force before the target cell can follow .",
    "similar lag and/or pinning , as well as sudden switch of the polarization is seen in the case of two target cells being driven by a single cell .",
    "a given cell in the middle of a chain would clearly have to deal with the influence of more than one cell , resulting in a more complex potential landscape and corresponding dynamical behavior .",
    "we also find for a single cell that in the case of low temperature or weak dissipation the cell _ recovers _ dynamical coherence , due to the ` pumping ' of the driver , clearly overpowering the thermal bath .",
    "other regimes will be discussed in detail .",
    "the behavior of the polarization of the basic cell as a function of time when the polarization of the driver is fixed , as well as when it changes linearly , has been briefly discussed recently .",
    "@xcite there , we studied the symmetric ( no defect ) case , but taking account of dissipation in the system . in",
    "what follows , we present a full report of the qca dynamical behavior under different electron - phonon and temperature conditions , and analyze the linear entropy of the system during these processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we describe the model for the entire system , composed of the qca and the thermal bath .",
    "we use an extended hubbard hamiltonian to describe the coulomb interactions present in the system ( target cell(s ) + driver cell ) .",
    "the thermal bath is represented by a set of harmonic oscillators , and the electron - phonon interaction enters as emission and absorption of phonons during electron tunneling events between quantum dots in the system . a markovian approach to the dynamical evolution of the reduced density matrix",
    "is presented in [ sub : mark ] , where the transition rates for the electron - phonon interaction in this system are explicitly obtained . in section [ sec : res ] we present and discuss the behavior of the polarization and linear entropy , as function of relevant parameters , with special emphasis on effects of dissipation and asymmetry .",
    "here , we also discuss the dynamics of multiple cells , as the qca ultimate devices involve multiple cell geometries .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "consider a problem described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 , where the subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for system and reservoir , respectively . in our case",
    ", @xmath20 describes the target cell in the presence of a driver cell which provides external driving fields on the system .",
    "the interactions are introduced via an extended hubbard hamiltonian with both intra- and inter - cell coulomb repulsion terms , as well as intra - cell tunneling , @xmath21 the first three terms describe the _ target _ or active cell and the last term describes the coulomb interaction between the electrons in the target cell and a _ driver _ cell which is externally controlled . here , @xmath22 is the confinement energy level in the @xmath23 quantum dot ( qd ) in the target cell . in this term ,",
    "possible dot asymmetries or local potential variations are introduced by changing the energy in a given @xmath24 qd , @xmath25 , where @xmath7 is the measure of the imperfection due to different dot size or a change in the local environment , and @xmath26 is the energy of the other ( identical ) dots .",
    "the amplitude @xmath27 is the tunneling matrix element between nearest neighbors @xmath28 on the same cell , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are creation and annihilation operators for site @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 is the electron number operator at site @xmath31 , @xmath33 is the coulomb interaction between sites @xmath12 and @xmath31 in the target cell , and @xmath34 is that between site @xmath12 in the driver cell ( with charge density @xmath35 , which in general changes in time ) and site @xmath31 in the target cell . a generalization to multiple cells",
    "is straightforwardly given by inter - cell interactions .",
    "@xcite following the notation of lent _ et al_. , @xcite the distance between nearest - neighbor dots ( length of the square side ) is @xmath36 , while the separation between the target and driver cells , located side by side , is @xmath37 ( see inset fig .",
    "notice we consider spinless electrons , although considering two - particle states with given total spin is also possible in our formalism .",
    "the hamiltonian for the reservoir is given by a set of harmonic oscillators of frequency @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are creation ( annihilation ) operators of phonons .",
    "finally , the electron - phonon interaction is given by a general expression , @xmath41 corresponding to emission / absorption of a phonon for electron tunneling events and with matrix elements given by the coefficients @xmath42 .",
    "notice that the physics of the phonon interactions in the system is well described by the model chosen here .",
    "although phonons are in principle present everywhere , and not only during tunneling events , they only provide an ` on - site ' energy renormalization / shift and broadening , which will be ignored here , as it yields a uniform correction to the entire cell .",
    "in contrast , the phonon - assisted tunneling events described by @xmath43 affect significantly the dynamics of the cell , as they provide an effective coupling mechanism among the different levels in the spectrum and allow for energy relaxation processes .    we assume , as in [ ] , that the quantum dots have a characteristic size @xmath44 nm defined on a gaas / algaas heterostructure , with effective mass @xmath45 .",
    "the typical distance between nearest - neighbor dots is @xmath46  nm , and the dielectric constant of the medium is @xmath47 .",
    "these values give an estimate of the coulomb repulsion between nearest neighbor dots of @xmath48  mev , which is taken as the unit of energy in this paper .",
    "one should notice that the first excited single - particle state in each dot lies at quite a high energy , @xmath49  mev @xmath50 , so that one can safely consider a single orbital per site , although additional single - particle levels in each dot could in principle be included .",
    "notice also that the on - site coulomb energy is quite high and prevents the double occupation of the dot , so that our basis set of states ignores that possibility .",
    "we should comment that successful implementations of qca elements using _ metallic _ islands are in a multiple - orbital regime , since in that case @xmath51 for typical 1@xmath52m - size islands .",
    "the condition of overall electrical neutrality of the target ( and driver ) cell is included in the calculation by distributing a uniform positive background charge @xmath53 throughout the cell ( @xmath54 in each dot ) , which results in multipolar fields from / at each cell .",
    "notice that we study the behavior of the target cell interacting with the driver via coulomb interaction only ( no inter - cell tunneling allowed ) .",
    "this interaction is described by the last term in the hamiltonian @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ h - eq ] ) , and assumed to be time dependent via @xmath35 .",
    "for a fixed driver and no dissipation , the solution can be found by direct numerical diagonalization of @xmath55 . in that case , the effect of various parameters on the polarization have been studied to show that the energy spectrum is strongly influenced by even small defects , which affect the bistability of the cell .",
    "@xcite in the case of a time - dependent driver , we have to take into account that the driver promotes transitions to intermediate excited states .",
    "in fact , the dynamical competition between the driver ( coherent terms in the equation of motion ) and the bath ( dissipative terms ) causes a non - trivial time evolution of the system .",
    "we have studied different ` driving schemes ' but will mostly consider here the case of a driver with a linear switching of its polarization , @xmath56 , for times @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the switching time .",
    "this corresponds to the configuration of charge densities in the driver cell of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "for the four - dot cell arranged on a square , we take @xmath61 for nearest - neighbor dots , while all others scale with their ( inverse ) separation .",
    "we also set all @xmath27 equal to a constant @xmath5 between nearest neighbors only ( not to be confused with time ) .",
    "+      in the interaction picture ( @xmath62 ) , the evolution of the total density matrix is given by @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2 } \\int^t_0 dt ' \\left [ \\hat v_{sr}^{(i)}(t ) , [ \\hat v_{sr}^{(i)}(t'),\\hat \\rho^{(i)}(t')]\\right ] ,   \\label{eq - dentot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the cell - bath interaction operator , and the expansion is valid up to second order in @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite    our approach uses a closed and time - local equation for the _ reduced density matrix _ ( rdm ) : @xmath66 where the trace is carried out over the degrees of freedom of the reservoir , @xmath19 .",
    "the following fundamental assumptions are made in this approach : ( 1 ) the system @xmath18 and reservoir @xmath19 are initially uncorrelated , which implies @xmath67 ; ( 2 ) a stationary reservoir at temperature @xmath68 with equilibrium density matrix @xmath69 , exists at all times ; and ( 3 ) the correlation time @xmath70 in the reservoir is much shorter than characteristic times for the rdm system to change appreciably , meaning that @xmath71 , if @xmath72 , while the state of the reservoir at time @xmath73 has already no correlation with the state at time @xmath5 ( markov approximation ) .",
    "thus one arrives at the time evolution equation for the rdm elements ( details of the derivation can be found in the literature @xcite ) , which in the schrdinger picture is given by @xmath74 the first term on the right represents reversible dynamics (  coherent \" effects ) , in terms of the transition frequencies @xmath75 , while the second term describes relaxation ( irreversible dynamics ) . in this part , the _ relaxation tensor _",

    "the first term ( @xmath85 ) describes the absorption of phonons , while the second ( @xmath86 ) describes phonon emission , both at a frequency given by the system s transition energy @xmath87 .",
    "notice that the matrix elements @xmath88 embody the appropriate selection rules for the different states involved in the transitions . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a model where the amplitude of interaction does not depend on the electronic states of the target cell , and has the form @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the constant prefactor of the electron - phonon interaction and is determined from the deformation potential model .",
    "@xcite we should emphasize that this model introduces dissipation effects only at finite temperature , and can not account for elastic decoherence effects .",
    "@xcite here , @xmath91 describes the frequency dependent amplitude of the electron - phonon interaction in the deformation potential model ; @xmath92 is the density of states in a debye model and @xmath93 is the transition frequency between states @xmath94 and @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that other phonon channels with different dispersion relations and/or matrix elements exist , but we believe that other modes would not be as effective in introducing dissipation in this system ( e.g. , optical phonons occur at energies too high to couple effectively ) , nor qualitatively change the results discussed here . in eq .",
    "( [ eq - rtilde ] ) , @xmath95 is a so - called non - adiabatic parameter whose real part gives a contribution to the time decay of the off - diagonal density matrix elements , and is then directly responsible for the loss of coherence .",
    "these parameters can be written in terms of the transition rates by @xmath96 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath97 is an intrinsic relaxation rate for each transition , which we assume negligible , @xmath98 , as it could be incorporated in the transition frequencies , @xmath99 .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting to point out that eq .",
    "( [ eq - master ] ) , written for the diagonal elements , takes the form : @xmath100 which has a simple interpretation : the probability of finding the level @xmath101 occupied at time @xmath5 , @xmath102 , increases due to transitions from all other levels @xmath94 _ to _ @xmath101 ( first term ) and decreases due to transitions _ from _ @xmath103 to all other levels @xmath94 ( second term ) .",
    "note also that the condition @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - master ] ) corresponds to ` fixed points ' of the dynamics of the system , as both the terms related to coherence , @xmath105 for @xmath106 , as well as the diagonal terms which determine the population in each state , do not change in time .",
    "these fixed point values depend only on the properties of the transition rates and the energy spectrum of the system ( as the external drive reaches a stationary configuration ) , and provide a direct determination of the dissipation times produced by the thermal bath .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq - trans ] ) that the transition rates satisfy @xmath107 which guarantees the detailed balance condition .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we have derived an explicit expression for the transition rates @xmath108 , which would behave at low temperatures , @xmath109 , and/or low dissipation ( small @xmath110 ) as the form used by zozoulenko _",
    "et al . _ , in a qualitative way .",
    "@xcite notice however that the normalization condition in [ ] is an added requirement in their phenomenological approach , while it is included naturally in our treatment .",
    "we should also mention that the detailed balance ratio in ( [ eq - cociente ] ) will determine the fixed point values of @xmath111 and all the corresponding physical properties , including the different state populations .",
    "since these will in general be asymmetric , the polarization value of the qca is reduced , and as we will see later , this results also in a limiting value for the linear entropy . a detailed analysis of the asymptotic fixed points in terms of the structure parameters",
    "will also shed light into the dynamical evolution of the system , as we will discuss .",
    "the solution of the master equation ( [ eq - master ] ) for the time evolution of the rdm is carried out numerically using a runge - kutta fourth order algorithm .",
    "we ensure , by a proper choice of the integration step , that the general normalization property @xmath112 for the rdm is satisfied at all times .",
    "notice that an instantaneous basis is incorporated in the calculation to take into account the evolution of the ground state induced by the time - dependent driver configuration .",
    "the basis functions are then defined by the eigenvalue / eigenvector problem of the coherent hamiltonian of the target cell , @xmath113 .",
    "notice also that the characteristic time variation of the driver @xmath58 is long compared with the target - cell s natural frequencies @xmath114 , so that @xmath115 .",
    "this is effectively the requirement for an adiabatic switching of the driver . as is clear in fig .",

    "this would require @xmath58 to be a few nanoseconds for the adiabatic switching regime to be valid .",
    "the numerical solution of the rdm is used to calculate the dynamics of the polarization in the target cell , as the physical observable of interest here .",
    "the dynamical behavior of @xmath118 , calculated from the charge density in each site as @xmath119 , and of the linear entropy @xmath120 $ ] , are then determined for a given set of parameters . in order to get better insights in the problem",
    ", we also carry out a calculation of the fully coherent dynamics , ignoring the phonon thermal bath ( setting @xmath121 in eq.[eq - trans ] ) . in the coherent limit ,",
    "the relevant parameters for the dynamical evolution are those defining the structure , including the tunneling amplitude @xmath5 , the separation of target and driver cell @xmath37 , the switching time of the linear driver @xmath58 , and the size of the dot asymmetry @xmath7 , if any . for the dissipative problem , on the other hand",
    ", it is clear that in addition to the structure features , the important parameters are the temperature of the thermal bath @xmath68 , and the amplitude of the electron - phonon interaction @xmath90 .",
    "of course , the phonon density of states , as well as the interaction details , will also play a role in the evolution of the system .",
    "our model parameters provide an adequate and realistic description of these systems in semiconducting qca .",
    "figure [ modelo]a shows the level spectrum in the target cell for a fixed driver polarization , @xmath122 , as shown in the inset .",
    "we see that the four - fold symmetry of the structure and consequent degeneracy is broken by the driver , even for @xmath123 .",
    "@xcite moreover , increasing the intra - cell tunneling @xmath5 produces additional level splittings , as one would expect .",
    "we should point out that the polarization of the ground state follows that of the driver , @xmath124 , but increasing hopping @xmath5 reduces that value somewhat .",
    "the first excited state has @xmath125 , and is separated from the ground state by a gap of @xmath126 in the range shown ( our energy units are @xmath3  mev ) .",
    "the four higher states have vanishing polarization , as the charges are located on neighboring sites along the sides of the square .",
    "the basic operation of the qca requires adiabatic evolution from a polarized ground state to the other with opposite polarization .",

    "increasing @xmath5 however , delocalizes the charges in the quantum dots and reduces the polarization of the target cell , as one can see from the long time limits in the figure . in order to look more closely at the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath140 , we analyze this quantity as a function of the tunneling coupling @xmath5 in fig .",
    "we find that , for @xmath138 , @xmath140 attains a minimum value at @xmath143 . from this figure",

    "this change is understandable if one thinks that the target cell closest to the driver ( cell 1 ) is in essence between two cells with different polarization and has its wrong polarization somewhat pinned ( this is behavior also seen in other work @xcite ) .",
    "increasing temperature to @xmath138 makes the switching a bit smoother although still with a sudden change , and with not as good final polarization .",
    "notice in particular that the asymptotic polarization of target cell 2 is poorer than that of cell 1 .",
