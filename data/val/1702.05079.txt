    "in a recent paper  @xcite , the author introduced information systems with witnesses as a logic - style representation of l - domains .",
    "l - domains have independently been introduced by coquand  @xcite and jung  @xcite and are known to form one of the two maximal cartesian closed full subcategories of the continuous domains .",
    "they generalise the bounded - complete ones : whereas in a bounded - complete domain every bounded subset has a global least upper bound , in an l - domain such sets may have different local least upper bounds depending on the upper bounds they have .    the idea to represent classes of domains via logical calculi goes back to dana scott s seminal 1982 paper  @xcite , in which he introduced information systems to capture the bounded - complete algebraic domains .",
    "an information system consists of a set of tokens to be thought of as atomic statements about a computational process , a consistency predicate telling us which finite sets of such statements contain consistent information , and an entailment relation saying what atomic statements are entailed by which consistent sets of these .",
    "theories of such a logic , also called states , i.e.  finitely consistent and entailment - closed sets of atomic statements , form a domain with respect to set inclusion .",
    "a state represents consistent information .",
    "so , any finite collection of substates must contain consistent information as well , and this fact is witnessed by any of its upper bounds .    whereas in scott s approach the consistency witnesses are hidden , in the new approach they are made explicit .",
    "this allows to consider the more general situation in which a finite set of tokens may have different consistency witnesses , and the result of entailment may depend on them .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the theories , or states , of such a more general information system form an l - domain , and , up to isomorphism , each l - domain can be obtained in this way .",
    "moreover , there is an equivalence between the categories of information systems with witnesses and l - domains .",
    "the category of information systems has approximable mappings as morphisms .",
    "these are relations between the consistent subsets of one information system and the tokens of another .",
    "entailment is a particular approximable mapping .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the category of l - domains and scott continuous functions is cartesian closed . because of the equivalence of this category with the category of information systems with witnesses we know that the latter one is cartesian closed as well .",
    "however , this means that in concrete situations we have to pass back and forth between information systems and domains in order to construct the exponent of two information systems with witnesses . in this paper",
    "we present a direct proof of the cartesian closure of the category of information systems with witnesses .",
    "in particular , we present a construction of the exponent .",
    "this will be an information system with witnesses the states of which are exactly the approximable mappings between the information systems under consideration .",
    "whereas for scott s information systems capturing the bounded - complete algebraic domains , the function space construction is straightforward and well understood , the situation is rather intricate in the present case .",
    "this due to the fact that consistency is only locally defined and we have to deal with consistency witnesses explicitly .",
    "moreover , as is known from hoofman s work  @xcite , in the continuous case entailment is required to allow for interpolation .    the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec - dom ] contains basic definitions and results from domain theory . in section  [ sec - infosys ] relevant definitions and facts about information systems with witnesses",
    "are recalled from  @xcite .",
    "approximable mappings between such information systems are considered in section  [ sec - am ] .",
    "section  [ sec - fctsp ] is concerned with the function space construction : an information system with witnesses is presented the states of which are exactly the approximable mappings between two given systems . as is shown in section  [ sec - cc ] , this information system is indeed the exponent of the two given ones .",
