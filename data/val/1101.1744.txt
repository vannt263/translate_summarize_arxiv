    "since gell - mann and zweig @xcite proposed the conception of quark , many authors have used this idea in the study of astrophysical problems @xcite .",
    "just as the discovery of neutron led to the idea of neutron star , the conception of quark naturally stimulated many physicists and astrophysicists to suggest that quark star maybe exists as well @xcite .",
    "in the later decades the research about the nature of quark star was developed .",
    "as is well known , the equation of state ( eos ) of matter plays a key role in the study of the structure of compact stars .",
    "however , at present it is very difficult to obtain the eos of compact matter from the first principle of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in all ranges of density and temperature .",
    "therefore one has to adopt various qcd inspired models to study the properties of dense objects .",
    "for example : the mit bag model @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl)model @xcite , and the perturbative qcd model @xcite .",
    "although all of these models can reflect some basic features of qcd , none of them can provide a complete and consistent framework to work in all ranges of density and temperature .",
    "the mit bag model can provide the quark confinement mechanism , the njl model can describe chiral symmetry breaking of qcd , while the perturbative qcd model works well at high energy scale due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "present astrophysical observations and laboratory experimental data can not enable one to make a clear choice among these models .",
    "so it is worthwhile to develop other models with better qcd foundation to study compact matter .",
    "recently , in ref . @xcite the authors derived a model - independent formula for calculating the eos of qcd at finite chemical potential and zero temperature with the aid of functional integral formalism and obtained an explicit analytic expression for the eos by applying the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dyson - schwinger approach and the model quark propagator proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall apply this eos to the study of structure of quark stars by considering two situations : with the @xmath5 term ( the pressure at zero chemical potential and temperature ) and without the @xmath5 term .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ eos ] , we first give a brief introduction to the model - independent formula for the eos of qcd at finite chemical potential and zero temperature derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and give the explicit analytic expression of the eos obtained using this formula with the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dyson - schwinger approach and the model quark propagator proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . from these results the properties of quark star , such as mass - radius and mass - energy - density relations",
    "are obtained by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation under two conditions : with the @xmath5 term and without the @xmath5 term .",
    "a comparison between our model and other models of quark star is made . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we offer a discussion of our study .",
    "\\(i ) eos of quark matter    it is well - known that in equilibrium statistical field theory @xcite , once the partition function ( or equivalently , eos ) of a system is obtained , then all the thermodynamical variables can be determined .",
    "the calculation of the eos of qcd at finite chemical potential is a contemporary focus .",
    "however , due to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , it is very difficult to get some valuable and reliable results about eos of qcd from perturbation theory at finite chemical potential .",
    "so people have developed various nonperturbative methods for studying strong interaction physics at finite density and zero temperature @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors derived a model - independent formula for calculating the eos of qcd at finite chemical potential and zero temperature with the aid of functional integral formalism .",
    "the expression of the eos derived there reads @xmath6(p)\\gamma_4 \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the number of quark colors and quark flavors , respectively ; @xmath9(p)$ ] and @xmath10(p)\\gamma_4 \\}$ ] are the dressed quark propagator and the quark - number density at finite @xmath11 , respectively . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) it can be seen that in order to obtain the eos at finite chemical potential , a key issue is to know the behaviors of the dressed quark propagator at finite @xmath11 . at present",
    "it is impossible to derive the exact quark propagator at finite @xmath11 from first principles of qcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite a new approximation method for obtaining the fermion propagator at finite @xmath11 was proposed by using the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dyson - schwinger approach and then the validity of this method was discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to obtain the dressed quark propagator at finite @xmath11 , one should specify the dressed quark propagator at @xmath12 in advance . in this work",
    "we choose the following model quark propagator proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath14 , where @xmath0 is a parameter connected to a dynamically generated quark mass .",
    "then , according to the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dressed quark propagator at finite @xmath11 can be written as @xmath15(p)=\\frac{1}{i\\gamma \\cdot { \\tilde p } a({\\tilde p}^2)+b({\\tilde p}^2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 . using the above @xmath9(p)$ ] , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained an explicit analytic expression for the eos by means of the formula ( [ eosformula ] ) .",
    "the quark - number density obtained there is @xmath17 and the pressure @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( the pressure at zero chemical potential ) is calculated from the cornwall- jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) effective action @xcite @xmath23-\\frac{1}{2}\\rm{tr}\\big[1-g_0^{-1}(p)g(p)\\big]\\bigg\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 n_c n_f \\int \\frac{d^4 p}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\bigg\\ { \\ln\\big [ \\frac{a^2(p^2)p^2+b^2(p^2)}{p^2}\\big ] -\\frac{p^2 a(p^2)[a(p^2)-1]+b^2(p^2)}{p^2 a^2(p^2)+b^2(p^2)}\\bigg \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the bare quark propagator . substituting the model quark propagator ( [ pagelsprop ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) , one obtains @xmath25 here , we want to stress that @xmath0 is connected to the dynamically generated quark mass .",
    "when one discusses low energy qcd at finite @xmath11 , it is evident that the dynamically generated quark mass should be @xmath11 dependent .",
    "so , in principle , @xmath0 should depend on @xmath11 .",
    "however , in this work , according to the approximation adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 is taken to be @xmath11 independent ( in fact , the value of @xmath0 can be determined experimentally , for example , from the value of @xmath26 decay constant @xmath3 or determined by @xmath4 annihilation experiment ) .",
    "before we turn to the study of quark star by means of eos ( [ pressure ] ) , it is necessary to have a look at eos ( [ pressure ] ) itself .",
    "first let us see the large @xmath11 behavior of @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath27 , the two step functions in eos ( [ pressure ] ) equal 1 . using the explicit expressions of @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ", one can expand the pressure in eos ( [ pressure ] ) around @xmath30 as follows : @xmath31 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{n_c n_f}{12\\pi^2}\\mu^4 \\bigg [ 1+\\frac{12}{16^{1/3 } } \\bigg(\\frac{m_d}{\\mu}\\bigg)^4+\\bigg(\\frac{m_d}{\\mu}\\bigg)^6+\\cdots \\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation clearly shows that , as @xmath32 , @xmath18 tends to the pressure of a massless free quark gas @xmath33 , and the deviation from the free quark gas result can be expanded in powers of the ratio @xmath34 .",
    "here it is interesting to compare our eos ( [ pressure ] ) with the cold , perturbative eos proposed in ref .",
    "the pressure density to second order in @xmath35 in the @xmath36 scheme obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is quoted as follows : @xmath37   \\bigg(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi}\\bigg)^2 \\bigg\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the renormalization subtraction point .",
    "the scale dependence of the strong coupling constant @xmath40 is taken as @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for @xmath44 . the only freedom in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is the choice of the ratio @xmath45 , which is taken to be 2 in that reference .",
    "the perturbative eos ( [ fps ] ) is applicable only in the chirally symmetric phase , when the chemical potential @xmath11 is larger than @xmath46 , the chiral phase transition point . from eq .",
    "( [ fps ] ) it can be also seen that as @xmath32 , the perturbative eos also tends to the free gas result , and the correction terms are from perturbative contributions . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) and ( [ fps ] ) , it can be seen that for moderate values of @xmath11 there is a quantitative difference between our eos ( [ pressure ] ) and the perturbative eos ( [ fps ] ) : for our eos the correction terms are positive and the pressure is larger than the free quark gas result , whereas for the perturbative eos the correction terms are negative and the pressure is lower than the free quark gas result . here",
    "it also should be noted that in our model @xmath47 sets the scale for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , therefore the correction terms in our eos arise from nonperturbative effects .",
    "second , let us see the small @xmath11 behavior of our eos ( [ pressure ] ) . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) it can be seen that the obtained quark - number density distribution differs significantly from the fermi distribution of a free quark gas .",
    "physically this is a consequence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the low energy region .",
    "we note that when @xmath11 is smaller than a critical value @xmath48 , the quark - number density vanishes identically , and the pressure @xmath18 equals @xmath5 ( i.e. , the pressure of the vacuum ) .",
    "namely , @xmath49 is a singularity which separates two regions with different quark - number densities .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with the general conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite . in that reference , based on a universal argument ,",
    "it is pointed out that the existence of some singularity at the point @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a robust and model - independent prediction .",
    "it should be noted that any eos of qcd at finite chemical potential and zero temperature with good qcd foundation should at least satisfy this requirement and our eos does satisfy it .    from the above analysis",
    "it can be seen that in both the large @xmath11 limit and small @xmath11 limit our eos has the correct behaviors required by qcd , which is quite different from other eoss , such as the perturbative eos ( [ fps ] ) . in addition",
    ", our eos ( 3 ) has another merit that it has a simple analytic form and contains only one adjustable parameter @xmath0 .",
    "so it can be easily applied in practical calculation of quark stars .",
    "therefore , we expect that our eos ( 3 ) can provide a possible new approach for the study of quark stars .    just as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath5 term in the eos is an important quantity , since it enters the energy density , which is relevant for integrating the tov equations . in order to see explicitly the influence of the @xmath5 term to the properties of quark star , in the calculations that follow , we shall distinguish two situations : with the @xmath5 term and without the @xmath5 term .",
    "a discussion on the physical meaning of this term will be given in the final part of this paper .",
    "now let us turn to using eos ( 3 ) to study the properties of quark star . in order to see the behavior of the pressure with the variation of @xmath11 , we plot the @xmath51 curve in fig . [",
    "fig : p ] . here , as in ref .",
    "[ 25 ] , we take @xmath52 in our calculation . from fig . [",
    "fig : p ] it can be seen that the pressure decreases with @xmath11 increasing under condition one ( with the @xmath5 term ) , whereas it increases with @xmath11 increasing under condition two ( without the @xmath5 term ) .",
    "the results of fraga et .",
    "al . @xcite and",
    "sqm1 @xcite are also shown in this figure . in fig . [",
    "fig : pressure - energy ] we make a comparison of the results in the present paper with those in our previous paper @xcite , fraga et .",
    "al . @xcite and the sqm1 models @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the sqm eos is the stiffest and the renombag3r model eos @xcite is the softest .",
    "this can be easily understood since the interaction between particles will soften the eos of the system .",
    "\\(ii ) property of quark star    using the above results , one can obtain the structure of quark star by integrating the tov equation : @xmath53 @xmath54 the calculated mass - radius relations and mass - energy density relations are shown in figs .",
    "3 - 6 , respectively . here",
    ", in order to see the sensitivity of the mass - radius relation on the parameter @xmath0 in our eos ( 3 ) , in the following calculation we will choose two values of @xmath0 : @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is fitted from the value of @xmath3 @xcite and determined by @xmath4 annihilation experiment @xcite , respectively . in order to see clearly the calculated results in figs .",
    "3 - 6 , we list them in table i.    [ tab : a ]    .model parameters and calculational results [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     from table i it can be seen that , for the case without the @xmath5 term , for @xmath1 , the maximal mass @xmath55 , the radius @xmath56 and the mass density @xmath57 , which is similar to the results calculated by means of the eos proposed in ref . @xcite without the @xmath5 term .",
    "the curve of the mass - radius relation is the same as that of a neutron star . for @xmath2 , the maximal mass @xmath58 , the radius @xmath59 and the mass density @xmath60 .",
    "here we note that our results for @xmath2 are very close to the most recent observational data reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in that reference the mass of the pulsar j1614 - 2230 is calculated to be @xmath61 and its radius is between 11 and 15 km ) . as was pointed out in that reference , this result rules out almost all currently proposed hyperon or boson condensate eos , whereas quark matter can support a star of such a mass only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are therefore not `` free '' quarks .",
    "our results support this observational data . for the case with the @xmath5 term , for @xmath1 , the maximal mass @xmath62 , the radius @xmath63 and the mass density @xmath64 . for @xmath2 , the maximal mass @xmath65 , the radius @xmath66 and the mass density @xmath67 .",
    "for these two values of @xmath0 , the curve of the mass - radius relation is the same as that of a typical quark star . from the above results it can be seen that for the case without the @xmath5 term , the structure of the star is sensitive to the value of @xmath0 , whereas for the case with the @xmath5 term",
    ", the structure of the star is insensitive to the value of @xmath0 .    from figs .",
    "5 and 6 it can be seen that the mass density obtained without the @xmath5 term is less than the corresponding one obtained with the @xmath5 term .",
    "the mass density obtained with the @xmath5 term is larger than the corresponding ones in all other models ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is because the eos for this case is soft and leads to a more compact star .",
    "here it is interesting to compare the study in the present paper with that in a previous work by some of the same authors @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath5 term is identified with @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the vacuum bag constant , and @xmath70 is taken as a phenomenological input , whereas in the present paper the @xmath5 term is determined self - consistently in the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dyson - schwinger approach .",
    "as we have mentioned above , in the present paper we consider two conditions : with the @xmath5 term and without the @xmath5 term ( the @xmath5 term is calculated using the cjt effective action ) .",
    "this term is not the same as the bag constant @xmath70 in the mit bag model , because it is positive while @xmath70 is negative !",
    "furthermore , in the calculation of structure of stars this term leads to negative energy density at small chemical potential , which is hard to understand from a physical point of view .",
    "this is one of our motivations for adopting the eos proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the properties of quark star .",
    "in addition , in spite of the progress made in the study of quark stars , there are still some authors who suspect the existence of quark star . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors think that there is no quark matter core in the neutron star .",
    "zel @xcite argued from their observational data that quark star can not exist , because in term of their observational results the mass @xmath71 and the radius @xmath72 .",
    "of course , other authors do not consent to her arguments @xcite , and the discovery of meta - millisecond pulsar is in favor of quark star @xcite .",
    "here we also note that in a recent paper @xcite , the authors argue that their observational data support the existence of quark star with strong interactions .",
    "therefore , the present astronomical observations do not rule out the existence of quark stars .",
