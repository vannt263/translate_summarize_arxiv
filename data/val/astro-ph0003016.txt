    "evidence is accumulating that nearby galactic nuclei commonly harbour massive dark objects @xcite .",
    "these objects are probably black holes , because such remnants from the qso era should be common @xcite and because some nuclear star clusters with the requisite mass and size would be improbably younger that their host galaxies @xcite . given a black hole mass , @xmath4 , a next important step is to constrain the rate , @xmath5 , at which material is being accreted onto the black hole . associated with any black hole",
    "is its eddington accretion rate , @xmath6 , which is the rate necessary to sustain the eddington luminosity . for a 10% radiative efficiency and @xmath7 , @xmath8 . for giant elliptical galaxies hosting black holes ,",
    "accretion - rate estimates have long been available for comparison with eddington rates @xcite .",
    "these estimates are based on @xcite accretion from an interstellar medium with temperature @xmath9  k and pressure @xmath10  @xmath11  k , with the accretion being characterized by a bondi radius @xmath12  pc and a bondi rate @xmath13 .",
    "then a black hole with @xmath14 in a medium with @xmath15 and @xmath16 will accrete at a bondi rate @xmath17  yr@xmath18 , which is almost four orders of magnitude less than the associated eddington rate of @xmath19  yr@xmath18 .",
    "the bondi rate estimates are therefore extremely sub - eddington",
    ". still , such low rates could be pervasive among nearby ellipticals and , moreover , could define a minimum level of activity for ellipticals hosting massive black holes    this letter examines the consequences , in the radio and x - ray regimes , of such low accretion rates in nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "the approach is to obtain deep radio continuum images of four ellipticals studied by @xcite and then interpret those images within the context of canonical advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) , reviewed recently by @xcite .",
    "the radio continuum from an adaf is thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized plasma , and the conversion between the adaf radio power , @xmath20 , and the adaf accretion rate , @xmath21 , is relatively straightforward if the black hole mass is known @xcite .",
    "recent efforts along these lines have focused on galaxies with significant radio emission from nonthermal synchrotron jets @xcite . in constrast , this study examines four quiescent elliptical galaxies previously undetected at radio wavelengths @xcite , thereby minimizing one of the largest potential complications in an adaf analysis - the role of jet outflows .",
    "further evidence for the quiesence of these four galaxies comes from their use as absorption - line templates in optical spectroscopic studies @xcite , plus their weak or undetected x - ray emission @xcite . for these four quiescent ellipticals",
    ", the new radio imaging constrains the adaf accretion rates to be @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 of the eddington rates .",
    "these adaf accretion rates derived at 8.5  ghz have important implications for the levels of x - ray emission expected from these quiescent galaxies .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) , described by @xcite , was used 1999 may 6 - 7 ut in its 1-km configuration to observe ngc4291 , ngc4564 , ngc4621 , and ngc4660 .",
    "data were acquired in dual circular polarizations and at a center frequency 8.4601  ghz with bandwidth 100  mhz .",
    "observations were made assuming a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "the phase calibrator j1153 + 8058 was used for ngc4291 , while j1239 + 0730 was used for the other three galaxies . scheduled on - source integration times were 105 - 120  minutes .",

    "@xmath23 depends in part on the galaxy major axis , @xmath24 , and values for both terms appear in table  1 .",
    "observations of 3c286 were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 3% .",
    "the data were calibrated using the 1999 october 15 release of the nrao aips software .",
    "no self - calibrations were performed .",
    "the aips task imagr was used to form and deconvolve images of the stokes @xmath25 emission from each galaxy .",

    "for the two detected galaxies , quadratic fits in the image plane yielded the peak flux densities tabulated , along with their errors that are quadratic sums of a 3% scale error and @xmath28 . those fits also yielded the following radio positions , along with their 1-d errors , @xmath34 , which are dominated by the peak signal - to - noise ratio @xcite : for ngc4621 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ; for ngc4660 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . each detected galaxy is less than 40% linearly polarized .",
    "radio continuum can be due to thermal synchrotron emission from an adaf onto a black hole , nonthermal synchrotron jets emerging from an adaf , or nonthermal synchrotron jets emerging from a standard accretion disk which itself emits no radio photons . in the radio regime",

    "the distances , @xmath31 , from @xcite are used to convert the new 8.5-ghz detections or limits to the observed powers , @xmath41 , given in the table .",
    "these rank among the the most sensitive radio powers , or power limits , available in the literature for elliptical galaxies @xcite . because emission from nonthermal synchrotron jets could account for some unknown fraction of the radio detections , the observed peak flux densities will in general impose upper limits to any adaf powers , @xmath42 .",
    "the radio power , @xmath20 , predicted for an adaf at a frequency , @xmath43 , depends upon : @xmath44 , the standard shakura - sunyaev parametrization of the kinematic viscosity in the accretion flow ; @xmath45 , the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure ; @xmath46 , the black hole mass in units of @xmath47 ; @xmath48 , the adaf accretion rate normalized to the eddington rate ; and @xmath49 , the equilibrium temperature of the electrons @xcite .",
    "canonical adafs adopt @xmath50 and an equipartition @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , for most cases of interest @xmath49 is fairly insensitive to the other model parameters , so an intermediate value of @xmath52  k is adopted .",
    "these values for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath49 then predict that , at frequency @xmath53  ghz , @xmath54 the values for @xmath42 from this work and for @xmath46 from @xcite , when inserted into equation  ( 1 ) , result in the normalized adaf accretion rates , @xmath48 , given in the table .",
    "these normalized adaf rates are highly sub - eddington , being @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 of the eddington rates .",
    "the latter two cases correspond to the galaxies with radio continuum detections .",
    "canonical adafs exisit only at normalized accretion rates below a critical rate , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the normalized rates , @xmath48 , in the table easily meet this consistency check for canonical , and other reasonable , values of @xmath44 .",
    "for the four quiescent ellipticals in this study , the black hole masses from @xcite yield the tabulated eddington accretion rates , @xmath6 .",
    "those rates are used to convert the normalized adaf rates , @xmath48 , in the table into the absolute adaf rates , @xmath21 , also entered in the table .",
    "the adaf accretion rates derived at 8.5  ghz , in both normalized ( @xmath48 ) and absolute ( @xmath21 ) form , have consequences for the predicted levels of x - ray emission from these quiescent elliptical galaxies , and these predicted levels must not violate the observed levels . only one galaxy , ngc4291 ,",
    "is a weak x - ray emitter and the other three remain undetected in the rosat all sky survey @xcite .",
    "that survey was conducted with the position sensitive proportional counter at soft x - rays ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and at an angular resolution of @xmath56 .",
    "the table gives values for , or upper limits to , the observed soft x - ray luminosities , @xmath57 , scaled to the @xcite distances .",
    "no deprojection analysis has yet been attempted for ngc4291 , since no rosat data from the high resolution imager are available .",
    "data at hard x - rays ( 2 - 10 kev ) are also lacking .",
    "an elliptical galaxy harboring an adaf will be a source of x - rays from the adaf itself and from the galaxy s interstellar medium .",
    "each photon source will be discussed in turn .",
    "the normalized adaf accretion rates derived at 8.5  ghz are so low that bremsstrahlung emission , not inverse compton scattering , will dominate the adaf s x - rays @xcite .",
    "the latter authors provide an expression for the bremsstrahlung luminosity of a canonical adaf that , at the @xmath49 adopted for equation  ( 1 ) , reduces to @xmath58 at a fiducial soft x - ray frequency of @xmath59  hz ; and reduces to @xmath60 at a fiducial hard x - ray frequency of @xmath61  hz . applying the tabulated values for @xmath46 and @xmath48 to equations  ( 2 ) and",
    "( 3 ) yields the tabulated predictions for the soft and hard x - ray luminosities of the adafs .",
    "the predicted luminosities at 1  kev are consistent with the published rosat limits for ngc4564 , ngc4621 , and ngc4660 , as well as for the rosat detection of ngc4291 but only if that detection is dominated by the galaxy s interstellar medium rather than by its adaf @xcite .",
    "note further that the adafs are expected to be six times more luminous at hard than at soft x - rays , so these galaxies must must be considered prime targets for observations in the 2 - 10  kev region with the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "soft x - rays can also arise from an elliptical s general interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "for the galaxies in this study , a bondi analysis of that medium can produce an estimate for the bondi accretion rate , @xmath62 , which can then be compared with the absolute adaf accretion rate , @xmath21 , derived at 8.5  ghz .",
    "the black hole masses from @xcite , in combination with @xmath63 being typical for elliptical galaxies @xcite , results in the bondi radii listed in the table . assuming further that the pressure , @xmath64  @xmath11  k , at the bondi radius satisfies @xmath65 @xcite , then the table gives the corresponding range in bondi accretion rates , @xmath62 .",
    "the bondi rate estimates for @xmath66 are generally consistent with the limits on the absolute adaf rates , @xmath21 , imposed at 8.5  ghz , although there is an order - of - magnitude discrepancy in the case of ngc4291 . in constrast ,",
    "for @xmath67 the bondi rates exceed the adaf rates for all four galaxies .",
    "meaningful comparions between @xmath62 and @xmath21 must clearly await a reliable pressure profile for ellipticals in general or , better still , for the galaxies in this study .",
    "futhermore , integration over any adopted pressure profile should not violate @xmath68 listed in the table .",
    "further radio observations to quantify any jet contamination in ngc4621 and ngc4660 are also needed , for two reasons .",
    "first , removal of jet contamination leads to reduced adaf emission , which in turn implies even lower adaf accretion rates .",
    "second , the presence of jet emission could signify the importance of physical processes ignored in canonical adaf models and explored by @xcite . follow - up vla imaging at other frequencies ,",
    "@xmath43 , but at matched angular resolutions would help assess jet contamination : the flux density from an adaf - dominated source is expected to rise as @xmath69 @xcite , whereas the flux density from a jet - dominated source is expected to exhibit a flatter spectral slope .",
    "although the 500-@xmath29jy  ba@xmath18 upper limits at 5  ghz from @xcite do have similar resolutions , they are too insensitive to impose useful constraints on spectral slopes between 5 and 8.5  ghz . moreover , higher - resolution imaging with the nrao vlba could provide morphological evidence for nonthermal synchrotron jets and spatially separate jet from adaf emission , as was successfully done for the spiral galaxy ngc4258 @xcite .",
    "finally , the image rms values , @xmath28 , achieved in this study required 2 hours of integration time .",
    "similar values for @xmath70 will be achieved after a 2-minute integration with the expanded vla @xcite .",
    "this will make it feasible , for the first time , to target all radio - quiescent ellipticals studied by @xcite , which should significantly advance our understanding of advection - dominated accretion flows as a new class of extragalactic radio emitters .",
