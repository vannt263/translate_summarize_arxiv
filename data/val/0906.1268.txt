    "studying the optical transients ( ot ) of grbs is one of the major tasks of the swift satellite .",
    "however , a significant fraction of grbs does not show detectable ot fluences .",
    "it means in the number of cases one measured only an upper limit instead of a real event . treating only those bursts exceeding the limit of detection with a high certainty one",
    "never can be sure how representative is the sample obtained in this way for the whole population of the grbs detected by the bat .",
    "survival analysis offers a solution to overcome this difficulty .",
    "if one knows a lower / upper bound for the measured data instead of concrete values they are considered as censored . in mathematical terms let we have two independent stochastic variables : @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath5 then @xmath6 is detected , otherwise @xmath7 which is an upper bound for @xmath6 in this way .",
    "a sample representing these observations consists of a mixture of real and censored ( upper bound ) data . in our case",
    "@xmath6 represents the brightness of an ot and @xmath7 an upper bound for the non real ( censored ) detection .",
    "kaplan and meier  @xcite showed it is possible to estimate the true distribution of a sample even in the case of censorship ( for the astronomical context see feigelson and nelson  @xcite ) .",
    "according to kaplan and meier the following estimate gives the survival function :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is is the probability distribution function and    @xmath10^{\\delta_i}\\ ] ]    @xmath11 means the number of data , @xmath12 equals 1 at non censored data and 0 in the censored case .",
    "it means the estimated survival function jumps at real data and remains constant in the case of censoring .",
    "until preparing this work swift observed 144 events and detected ot in 31 cases .",
    "73 bursts have only upper limits and the rest has no optical data . before making the survival analysis the effect of the foreground extinction",
    "has to be removed .",
    "we used the data of schlegel et al .  @xcite . performing the analysis we derived the true cumulative distribution of the v visual magnitudes which can be compared with that of the measured optical events , as displayed in figure [ surv1 ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a homogeneous spatial distribution in euclidean space would resulted in a coefficient of 0.6 instead of 0.234 , as obtained .",
    "this result gives an important constraint on estimating the spatial distribution of ot events .",
    "the bat on the swift satellite measured the fluence , peak flux and @xmath3 duration in the 15 - 150 kev energy range .",
    "we computed the pearson linear correlation between the extinction - corrected @xmath0 visual magnitude of the ots and the logarithms of quantities mentioned .",
    "we obtained significant correlation only with the logarithmic peak flux at the 99.7% level ( see fig .",
