    "however , theoretical work also suggests that some obstacles must be overcome before we can self - assemble information - rich structures of arbitrary size ( dna brick nanostructures are about 1000 components in sizeke2012three , ke2014dna ) .",
    "for one , the growth rate of a structure made of @xmath0 distinguishable components will likely be of order @xmath0 times less than that of the corresponding indistinguishable - particle structure , because only about 1 in @xmath0 inter - component collisions can promote growthedges2014growth .",
    "for another , the energy scale of inter - component bonds must grow on the scale of @xmath1 in order to render the desired structure thermodynamically stable , because bond energies must counter the entropy associated with permuting component types in solutionedges2014growth , murugan2015undesired , frenkel2015order ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this energy scale is , for macroscopic objects with @xmath2 , in excess of @xmath3 .",

    "this is so even if the only interactions present are those designed to stabilize the intended structure  we will call these _ native _ interactions  so suggesting a limit to the scale on which information - rich structures may be self - assembled .    to overcome this limitation one must either seek to make defined _ nonequilibrium _ structuresanz2007evidence , peters2009competing , scarlett2010computational , whitelam2014self , or else engineer an assembly pathway that is immune to the kinetic traps associated with strong native inter - component interactions .",
    "this paper focuses on the second of these options .",
    "we will focus on a 2d assembly scheme , a version of which has been used in experiment to create dna nanotile latticespark2006finite ( that scheme aimed to produce many copies of a small target structure ; here we will be concerned with making one copy of a large target structure ) . in this scheme",
    ", each stage of assembly involves the formation of distinct squares , stabilized by four internal bonds .",
    "each bond is in general mediated by multiple components . in the presence of native interactions only",
    ", each square can be formed only from four particular pieces .",
    "no matter the strength of the bonds between these four pieces , or the order in which bonds are made , no mis - binding can happen during construction of the square .",
    "in other words , this scheme is immune to the kinetic traps associated with strong native inter - component interactions . to enable such an assembly pathway one can either combine reactants in stagespark2006finite , or ` switch on ' inter - component interactions in stages , as illustrated in ( a ) . in the first stage of assembly , selected interactions between monomers promote the assembly of squares of size 4 .",
    "one then turns on additional interactions to promote the formation of second - stage structures , squares of size 16 , and so on , with stage @xmath5 structures being of size @xmath6 .",
    "this process can continue as long as structures can be brought into contact , so permitting the generation of an arbitrarily large information - rich array .",
    "this array could provide a template for building in the third dimension , with e.g. subsequent layers deposited one at a timeademartiri2015programmable ; see panel ( b ) .",
    "the chief drawback of this scheme it that it is , like other forms of hierarchical assemblyvillar2009self , haxton2013hierarchical , madge2015design , particularly susceptible to kinetic traps caused by ` undesigned ' or _ non - native _ interactions , by which we mean interactions that are not required to stabilize the intended structure . such interactions include those between components _ not _ designed to be adjacent in the assembled structure , or interactions between intended neighbors that promote binding incompatible with the target structure .",
    "non - native interactions might arise in experiment because of ` accidental ' complementarity between dna sequences , or because of nonspecific van der waals attractions . `",

    "the hierarchical scheme is likely to be inferior to a non - hierarchical scheme if non - native interactions are not intentionally suppressed .",
    "indeed , the authors of found for dna tiles that the ` square - upon - square ' hierarchical assembly scheme was inferior to a non - hierarchical scheme ( in which all component types were combined directly ) , even when used to make a relatively small @xmath7 array .",
    "despite this finding , we argue here that the hierarchical scheme can in principle be used to build larger information - rich structures than can the non - hierarchical scheme ( which can not tolerate strong native interactions ) , _ if _ one can suppress non - native interactions .",
    "perhaps this could be done by combining dna - mediated interactions with some form of inter - particle repulsion ( we discuss this point further in the conclusions section ) .",
    "if so , the stage - by - stage hierarchical assembly pathway offers a potential route to the assembly of large information - rich structures in thermal equilibrium .    in section  [ model ]",
    "we introduce an off - lattice particle - based computer model that can be used to study stage - by - stage hierarchical assembly . in section  [ results ]",
    "we show that simulations of this model confirm that stage - by - stage assembly results in error - free formation of a desired structure , even in the presence of arbitrarily strong native interactions .",
    "we show that the same scheme fares poorly in the presence of attractive non - native interactions .",
    "we also discuss the efficiency of a conventional self - assembly process in the presence of irreversible or reversible native interactions .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conc ] .",
    "for the trajectory shown in , we plot as a function of time @xmath8 the fraction @xmath9 of the system s mass contained within ( natively - bonded ) clusters of size @xmath10 .",
    "the completion of each stage of assembly corresponds to the point at which each line reaches the value unity , at which point the interactions required to promote the next stage of assembly are automatically switched on .",

    "the idea of assembling structures in a stage - by - stage manner has been studied theoretically in the dna tile literaturedemaine2011one , patitz2010self , abel2010shape , where the possibility of extending stage - by - stage assembly to large scales was noted .",
    "the particular case of square - upon - square assembly sketched in ( a ) has been demonstrated in experiments in which dna tiles formed many distinct @xmath7 arrayspark2006finite . here",
    "we study this process numerically , using off - lattice molecular simulation , in order to demonstrate that it can in principle be used to avoid kinetic traps associated with very strong native interactions .",
    "for the reasons discussed in section  [ intro ] , such avoidance is a necessary feature of a process designed to make large information - rich structures in thermal equilibrium . we shall also show that this scheme is particularly vulnerable to kinetic trapping caused by non - native interactions .",
    "our model of stage - by - stage assembly comprises 1024 hard discs of radius @xmath12 on a smooth , two - dimensional substrate .",
    "each disc is of a distinct type , one of 1024 possibilities , labeled @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "discs are decorated with 4 sticky patches , each of opening angle @xmath15 , arranged in a regular way ( i.e. neighboring patch bisectors are separated by an angle @xmath16 ) , so as to allow self - assembly of a square lattice structure .",
    "as shown in ( a ) , patches @xmath17 are numbered 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 in a clockwise fashion .",
    "discs possess attractive pairwise interactions that are square - well in both anglekern2003fluid and range .",
    "if the centers of two discs @xmath13 and @xmath18 are separated by a distance @xmath19 that satisfies @xmath20 , and if the line joining disc centers cuts through one patch on each disc , then discs receive a pairwise energetic reward of @xmath21 , where    e = f(i , j , p;i,j,p ) _ native + ( 1-f(i , j , p;i,j,p))_non - native .    here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energy scales of native and non - native interactions . unless otherwise stated we took @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath26 depends on the disc- and patch identities involved in the pairwise contact : @xmath17 is the patch number of disc @xmath13 involved in the pairwise contact , and @xmath27 is the patch number of disc @xmath18 involved in the pairwise contact .",
    "@xmath26 is chosen so that the structure shown in ( b ) is the thermodynamically stable one .",
    "this structure , the target for self - assembly , is a square lattice in which disc type @xmath13 is found at the intersection of the the @xmath28th column and @xmath29th row of the lattice , numbered from the bottom left .",
    "that is , the bottom left disc is of type ( 0,0 ) , and the top right disc is of type ( 31,31 ) .",
    "disc types are colored so that the target structure possesses a green - to - blue - to - red color gradient . to stabilize this structure we require @xmath30 to be 1 if patch 1 on disc @xmath13 interacts with patch 3 on disc @xmath31 , or if patch 0 on disc @xmath13 interacts with patch 2 on disc @xmath32 ; these are ` native ' interactions .",
    "otherwise @xmath26 is 0 , indicating a ` non - native ' interaction .",
    "in equation form these requirements read [ direct ] f(i , j , p;i,j,p ) = ( i+1,i ) ( j , j ) ( p,1 ) ( p,3 ) + + ( j+1,j)(i , i ) ( p,0 ) ( p,2 ) , where @xmath33 is 1 if @xmath34 , and 0 otherwise . in pictures , in general , patches are shown white when engaged in a native contact , and black when unbound or engaged in a non - native contact .    to allow assembly of the target structure in a hierarchical manner we further distinguish disc native interactions by ` stage ' . interactions up to stage @xmath5",

    "thus , interactions of stage 1 can promote the formation of squares of 4 discs ( of 256 possible types ) ; stage 1 and 2 interactions allow the formation of 64 distinct square 16-mers ; stage 1 , 2 , and 3 interactions allow the formation of 16 distinct square 64-mers ; stage 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 interactions allow the formation of 4 distinct square 256-mers ; and stage 1,2,3,4 and 5 interactions allow the formation of one square of size 1024 .",

    "disc structures therefore do not dissociate , although they possess internal flexibility on account of the finite range and angular specificity of disc - disc interactions .",
    "discs were initially randomly dispersed and oriented , subject to there being no hard - core overlaps .",

    "for comparison , we also carried out hierarchical simulations in which non - native patch - patch interactions ( those that return zero on the right - hand side of ) were nonzero ( ( b ) , , ) , and we did ` non - hierarchical ' simulations in which all native interactions were turned on from the start of the simulation , i.e. we set @xmath51 for @xmath52 ( , , ) .",

    "the completion of each stage of assembly corresponds to the point at which the individual lines reach the value unity , at which point the interactions required to promote the next stage of assembly are automatically switched on . from trajectory to trajectory we found that that time required to complete each stage varied , the more so as assembly progressed .",

    "there is a slight slowing of assembly , relative to the case of zero non - native interaction , because of brief mutual adhesion of large clusters .    for stronger non - native interactions we found that assembly is arrested prior to stage 4 . in ( a )",

    "but self - assembly done in the presence of strong interactions results in general in kinetic trapping , suggesting a limit to the size of a self - assembled structure built from distinguishable components . here",
    "we have used simulation to show that the stage - by - stage assembly of squares demonstrated in experiment in can work even in the presence of arbitrarily strong interactions , as long as those interactions are the ` native ' ones required to stabilize the target structure .",
    "this property is not shared by most other forms of self - assembly , and is required if one wishes to make large , information - rich structures in equilibrium .",
    "note that we have assembled a single structure of size @xmath61 to demonstrate that error - free hierarchical assembly can occur even in the face of arbitrarily strong interactions .",
    "we stopped at stage 5 of the procedure because simulating larger systems is too time - consuming , but the hierarchical procedure can be used in principle to assemble a single `` information - rich '' structure of any size .",

    "imagine now that we have @xmath61 such reactions occurring in parallel .",
    "provided that disc - disc native interactions are chosen in the appropriate manner , combining the results of all reactions would lead to the hierarchical assembly of a @xmath62-particle structure : imagine a time - series like that shown in in which the smallest discs shown are not monomers but the @xmath61-particle assemblies that result from the first set of reactions .",
    "and so on . size limitations",
    "then result from practical considerations .",
    "one such consideration is that the stage - by - stage scheme is particularly susceptible to kinetic trapping caused by attractive non - native interactions , and so these must be suppressed if the scheme is to be used to make large objects . with dna - mediated interactions alone , as noted in , it seems difficult to guarantee strong native interactions and very weak non - native ones , on account of accidental basepair complementarity .",
    "choosing complementary sequences at random , one would expect two ` non - complementary ' 4-letter sequences of length @xmath63 to be ` accidentally ' complementary in @xmath64 places on average . to suppress non - native interactions it may be necessary to equip components with repulsive interactions intermediate in energy scale between fully - complementary interactions and accidentally - complementary ones .",
    "if this can be done , then in principle the scheme presented in and simulated here can be used to make large objects . however , technical challenges exist , of which four are as follows ( more detailed discussions of several of these points can be found in the dna tile literaturedemaine2011one , patitz2010self , abel2010shape , park2006finite ) .",
    "first , one must be able to ` switch on ' interactions selectively .",
    "perhaps if native interactions correspond to a certain number of fully - complementary basepairs , then selected strands could initially be ` turned off ' or ` protected ' by partially - complementary single strands . at the required stage of the process",
    "the system temperature could be raised slightly , so as to allow thermal dissociation of protector strands only .",
    "protector strands of subsequent stages must be successively more strongly bound , and all must be much less strongly bound than native inter - component bonds .",
    "second , one must be able to monitor the progress of assembly with sufficient precision to know when all the structures in the current stage have assembled ( or wait long enough to be sure that this has happened ) ; premature activation of the next stage s bonds could cause kinetic trapping .",
    "perhaps ` smarter ' ways to vary inter - component interactions without requiring explicit intervention by the user can be developed , by using novel feedback schemesklotsa2013controlling or other nonequilibrium controls of assemblybyun2013unconventional , han2013large , li2014crafting .",
    "third , large clusters diffuse slowly , particular when bound to a surface , and so it is likely that stirring the solution or shaking the surface will be required to allow assembly to proceed beyond a certain lengthscale ( shaking may also help break up kinetic traps caused by residual non - native interactions ) .",
    "fourth , this scheme confronts the challenges inherent to any scheme involving a large number of component types , such as difficulties of synthesis ( the number of dna labels must increase with system size , for instance ; see the si of ) and issues of long timescales .",
    "that said , shows that square - upon - square assembly reactions can be run in parallel : one could in principle combine the outcome of @xmath65 separate hierarchical processes as the starting point for the next stage of assembly , thereby achieving @xmath65-fold speed - up relative to the case of sequential self - assembly .",
    "table  [ table_summary ] compares conventional and hierarchical assembly schemes .",
    "we note finally that the scheme proposed here can not be applied ( without introducing the idea of twist - sensitive , protein - like interactionsmannige2009geometric , levy20063d ) to two - dimensional objects free to move in three - dimensional space : flip over a square and it can bind with its intended partner in a non - ideal way .",
    "a similar observation applies to three - dimensional structures .",
    "therefore , we speculate that building 3d information - rich structures may be best done by using a hierarchical scheme to generate large 2d surface - bound assemblies , and then building layer by layer on top of them .

    "imagine that our goal is to promote the self - assembly , from solution , of a solid , equilibrium structure made of @xmath0 components .",
    "components generally lose translational and rotational entropy upon going from solution to a solid structure , and so the energy scale @xmath66 of inter - component bonds in the solid structure must be large enough that a monomer s energetic gain upon solidification exceeds temperature times the entropic cost of its removal from solution .",
    "if components are distinguishable , and if the solid structure of interest conforms to one particular arrangement of components , then upon solidification one _ also _ loses an entropy @xmath67 per particle , because the number of accessible configurations of the solution phase is @xmath68 times that of its distinguishable counterpart .",
    "the inter - component bond strength @xmath66 must therefore grow on the scale of @xmath69 in order to ensure the stability of a distinguishable structure built from @xmath0 components .",
    "the average bond energy per particle must be at least @xmath70 greater than in the corresponding single - component case , where @xmath71 is the number of contacts made by each particle .",
    "for @xmath0 macroscopic , of order @xmath72 , this excess bond energy exceeds @xmath73 when @xmath74 ( appropriate to the case modeled here or the experiments of ) , and is about @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "a similar result can be obtained by considering the microscopic dynamics of growth .",
    "say that in the indistinguishable case the rate of arrival of a component at a given point on a solid structure is @xmath77 , which is proportional to component concentration .",
    "say that the rate of departure of that particle from the structure is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath71 is the number of bonds made by the particle . in general , the arrival rate must exceed the departure rate in order to ensure stability of the structure with respect to dissolution .",
    "now in the _ distinguishable _ case the arrival rate , for fixed total component concentration , is @xmath80 , because only about 1 in @xmath0 encounters involves the component designed to fit at that point on the structure ( now we imagine for simplicity that the number of components in solution is very large , and does not diminish upon binding ) . so upon going from indistinguishable to distinguishable the rate of arrival of material has dropped by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "to guarantee structural stability , therefore , the rate of departure of material must drop by a similar factor , i.e. @xmath81 . hence stability requires that @xmath82 must increase in proportion to @xmath69 .",
    "we tested this expectation by building the 1024-particle target structure and simulating it ( in the same square simulations boxes that we used for dynamic simulations ) in the presence of native interactions only , and in the presence of native and nonnative interactions of equal strength . in the former case particles",
    "make energetic bonds only if they adopt one particular position in the structure , while in the latter case the energy of the system is invariant under particle permutation , or if particles are rotated by multiples of @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore expect the extra pair energy ( in units of @xmath4 ) required to stabilize the structure in the native - interaction case to be @xmath83 ( for @xmath84 ) . by performing simulations for different values of binding energies we determined that in the presence of native interactions the structure melted for bond energy values @xmath85 between 7.3 and 7.1 , while in the presence of native and nonnative interactions of equal strength the condensed structure melted for values of @xmath85 between 3.8 and 3.6 .",
    "although simulations of this nature do not give us a precise measure of structural stability , the difference between these two ` melting points ' is @xmath86 , consistent with our expectation of 3.66 .",
    "the same considerations also suggest that the growth rate of a distinguishable structure will be a factor of @xmath0 less than that of its indistinguishable counterpart , i.e. @xmath87 upon going from indistinguishable to distinguishable .",
    "let us assume that collisions between squares are uncorrelated events . during stage @xmath5 of assembly",
    "these events occur with mean time @xmath88 , where @xmath89 for translation - limited events , and @xmath90 for rotation - limited events . to go from stage @xmath91 to stage @xmath5 of assembly there",
    "must occur of order @xmath92 events .",
    "so the mean time to complete stage @xmath5 of assembly scales , very roughly , as @xmath93 if assembly is translation - limited , and @xmath94 if assembly is rotation - limited .",
    "the data of ( b ) lie between these extremes but appear to generally increase with @xmath5 , suggesting that assembly is dominated , especially at late stages , by the rotational component of diffusion ."

    "<S> self - assembly in the laboratory can now yield ` information - rich ' nanostructures in which each component is of a distinct type and has a defined spatial position . ensuring the thermodynamic stability of such structures requires inter - component interaction energies to increase logarithmically with structure size , in order to counter the entropy gained upon mixing component types in solution . however , self - assembly in the presence of strong interactions results in general in kinetic trapping , so suggesting a limit to the size of an ( equilibrium ) structure that can be self - assembled from distinguishable components . here </S>",
    "<S> we study numerically a two - dimensional hierarchical assembly scheme already considered in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this scheme is immune to the kinetic traps associated with strong ` native ' interactions ( interactions designed to stabilize the intended structure ) , and so , in principle , offers a way to make large information - rich structures . in this scheme the size of an assembled structure scales exponentially with the stage of assembly , and assembly can continue as long as random motion is able to bring structures into contact . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting superstructure could provide a template for building in the third dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the chief drawback of this scheme is that it is particularly susceptible to kinetic traps that result from ` non - native ' interactions ( interactions not required to stabilize the intended structure ) ; the scale on which such a scheme can be realized therefore depends upon how effectively this latter kind of interaction can be suppressed . </S>"
