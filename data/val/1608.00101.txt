    "one of the most important branches of classical and quantum cryptography is secure multi - party computation ( smc ) ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "smc is a primitive for distributed computation .",
    "it enables the distributed computing of correct output of a function in a situation , where the inputs are given by a group of mutually distrustful users .",
    "a smc is required to be fair , and secure .",
    "specifically , it should not leak the secret inputs of the individual players .",
    "efforts have been made to achieve this in various ways , both classically @xcite and quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "however , in those efforts @xcite , it has been assumed that some of the users follow the protocol honestly ( which implies that some of the users are semi - honest ) . among the variants of smc schemes ,",
    "a specific variant having particular importance is `` socialist millionaire problem '' which was first introduced by yao @xcite in 1982 as a computing task where two millionaires ( alice and bob ) wish to know who is richer without disclosing the amount of their wealth to each other .",
    "subsequently , boudot et al .",
    "@xcite , modified it to a task where the millionaires are only interested to know whether they are equally rich or not .",
    "thus , they wish to compute a function @xmath0 , where the subscripts @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent inputs from alice and bob , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are essentially classical information corresponding to the assets of alice and bob , and a scheme for boudot s version of the socialist millionaire problem is actually a scheme for private comparison of equality of information .",
    "a lot of work has been done on classical private comparison , but as the security of all classical cryptographic schemes are conditional , it can never lead to an unconditionally secure scheme of private comparison .",
    "in contrast , we can achieve unconditional security in the quantum world .",
    "this fact led to many proposals for private comparison of equality of information using quantum resources @xcite , we may refer to all such protocols as protocols for `` quantum private comparison ( qpc ) '' .",
    "before we proceed further , it would be apt to note that qpc problem , the socialist millionaire problem and tierce problem @xcite are equivalent , and in what follows we will mostly refer to all such problems as qpc problem .    in the original definition of socialist millionaire problem , it was a two - party computation task , but a pioneering work of lo @xcite established that two - party secure qpc is not possible .",
    "this implies that to implement a secure qpc , we must have a third party ( tp ) , who would assist the users to compare the equality of their secrets .",
    "interestingly , the tp may be semi - honest @xcite , semi - honest having an intelligent robot @xcite , dishonest @xcite , or almost - dishonest @xcite . despite , the strong proof of lo",
    ", some efforts have been made to achieve qpc without tp @xcite , but they have been found to be insecure and/or unfair @xcite .",
    "thus , in what follows , we will concentrate on three party protocols of qpc , where a tp helps alice and bob to compare the equality of their information . such protocols for qpc have been proposed using different types of entangled states .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a scheme for qpc has been proposed using @xmath5-type state , @xmath6 state was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , bell state was used in @xcite , ghz state was used in @xcite .",
    "further , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a group theoretic structure of the protocols of quantum dialogue was proposed using a large number of different types of entangled states ( e.g. , @xmath7 and brown states ) , and it was shown that the quantum dialogue scheme proposed there can be converted to a protocol of the socialist millionaire problem , which is equivalent to qpc .",
    "thus , in @xcite , several options for realization of protocols for qpc were provided .",
    "further , in the similar line , in @xcite , a set of new options ( e.g. , 4-qubit @xmath8 state , 4-qubit cat state , etc . ) for realization of qd , and thus , qpc have been proposed .",
    "it s already established that the schemes for qpc have useful applications in private bidding and auctions , secret ballot elections , e - commerce , etc .",
    "( @xcite and references therein ) . due to the fact that a scheme for qpc has applications in many fields ,",
    "many variants of qpc have been studied in the recent past .",
    "for example , huang et al .",
    ", have recently proposed a ghz - state - based qpc scheme for @xmath9 users @xcite .",
    "huang et al.s scheme considers an almost - dishonest tp and allows him to compare the equality of the secrets of a subset of users , too .    in",
    "what follows , we plan to propose two protocols for qpc in the line of modified tseng - lin - hwang ( tlh ) protocol , which was proposed in its original form in 2012 @xcite . in the original tlh protocol",
    "a scheme for quantum private comparison was proposed using bell states , but almost immediately after the publication of tlh scheme , yang et al .",
    ", @xcite had shown that there exist a security flaw in the original tlh scheme and other similar schemes , which assume tp to be semi - honest .",
    "yang et al .",
    ", @xcite also proposed a modified scheme which they claimed to be free from the limitations of the previous protocols as their scheme considered a dishonest tp .",
    "subsequently , in an interesting work on cryptanalysis of yang et al.s scheme , it was observed by zhang et al .",
    ", @xcite that yang et al.s scheme was also not completely secure . keeping these facts in mind , here we aim to propose two schemes of qpc that are free from the attacks described earlier and are fundamentally different from all the existing schemes as one of the proposed schemes is semi - quantum in nature and the other one is a completely orthogonal - state - based scheme .    in a practical situation ,",
    "all communication schemes are affected by the noise present in the communication channel .",
    "so it s extremely important to know how qpc schemes behave in the presence of noise .",
    "recently , some efforts have been made to investigate the effect of noise on qpc schemes .",
    "for example , the effects of pauli noise @xcite , and collective amplitude damping @xcite have been studied very recently .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no serious effort has yet been made to rigorously investigate the effect of a complete set of possible noise models on the schemes of qpc .",
    "this paper aims to do that for the protocols proposed in this paper .",
    "remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : protocols - for - quantum ] , we have proposed two schemes of qpc that are fundamentally different from the existing schemes of qpc . in section [ sec : analysis - of - security - efficiency ] , the security and efficiency of the proposed schemes are analyzed .",
    "the effect of various types of noise models on the proposed schemes is are investigated in section [ sec : effect - of - different - noise ] .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce two protocols for qpc .",
    "the first one is an orthogonal - state - based protocol , and the second one is a semi - quantum protocol . here",
    ", we assume that alice and bob wish to compare their assets with the help of a tp .      in quantum cryptography , orthogonal - state - based protocols are of fundamental interest as in contrast to bb84 type conjugate coding based protocol , where the security arises from the conjugate coding or noncommutivity , here ( i.e. , in case of orthogonal - state - based schemes )",
    ", the security arises from the duality ( monogamy of entanglement ) for single particle ( multipartite entangled ) states .",
    "the first ever orthogonal - state - based scheme of qkd was introduced in 1995 @xcite , and is now known as gv protocol . since then several quantum cryptographic schemes based on orthogonal states have been proposed for various cryptographic tasks .",
    "for example , orthogonal - state - based schemes have been proposed for qka @xcite , qsdc @xcite , dsqc @xcite , cdsqc @xcite , etc .",
    "a few of these schemes have also been experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no effort has yet been made to design an orthogonal - state - based protocol for quantum private comparison . in",
    "what follows , the same is proposed in 8 steps , which are denoted by @xmath10 where osb stands for orthogonal - state - based .",
    "this notation is adopted to distinguish steps of this protocol from the steps of our second protocol , which is a semi - quantum scheme , and whose steps are denoted by @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for semi - quantum .",
    "the proposed orthogonal - state - based scheme works as follows :    osb1 : : :    tp prepares @xmath13-epr pairs randomly chosen from the set of    four bell states    @xmath14 .",
    "tp prepares two quantum sequences , namely @xmath15 and    @xmath16 , which contain all the first and second particles    of the epr pairs , respectively .",
    "+    thus , both @xmath15 and @xmath16 , contain    @xmath13 qubits , and if a sequence is transmitted via quantum    channel , we would require to check half of the travel qubits for    eavesdropping .",
    "the same can be done by adding @xmath13 decoy    qubits in each sequence .",
    "this is so because that would provide an    upper bound on the errors in the qubits not checked for eavesdropping ,    and the error would become asymptotically small for large values of    @xmath13 .",
    "osb2 : : :    tp prepares two copies of    @xmath17 .",
    "he uses the first    ( second ) copy as a set of decoy qubits @xmath18    ( @xmath19 ) to be randomly inserted in the sequence    @xmath20 to perform eavesdropping check using    gv - subroutine ( detail of gv - subroutine can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , tp randomly inserts @xmath18 in    @xmath15 ( @xmath19 in @xmath16 ) to    obtain a new enlarged sequence @xmath21    @xmath22 .",
    "later , he sends the quantum    sequence @xmath21 to alice and    @xmath23 to bob .",
    "osb3 : : :    after receiving quantum sequences @xmath24    alice / bob perform gv subroutine for eavesdropping check with the help    of tp . they compute the error rate , if this error rate is more than a    predetermined allowed threshold value , then they abort the protocol    and restarts from obs1 considering that an eavesdropper is present .    otherwise , they proceed to the next step .",
    "+    as the eavesdropping is checked by measuring the decoy qubits , after    this step , alice and bob are left with @xmath25 and    @xmath26 , respectively , because they remove the qubits    measured for eavesdropping check .",
    "osb4 : : :    qubits of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are now    measured in computational basis by alice and bob , respectively . both    would individually obtain @xmath13-bits key strings of bit    values @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponding to the    measurement outcomes @xmath29 and    @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the bit string with alice ( bob )    is denoted as @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "osb5 : : :    alice and bob prepare a shared key @xmath33@xmath34    of @xmath13-bits using an orthogonal - state - based scheme of qkd    @xcite or quantum key agreement ( qka ) @xcite .",
    "osb6 : : :    alice and bob have the private information regarding their assets    which they wish to compare .",

    "meanwhile , bob also encrypts his message @xmath36 with keys    @xmath32 and @xmath33@xmath34 by using    the same operation to obtain    @xmath38 .    here",
    ", the superscript @xmath39 denotes the @xmath39th    bit of the @xmath13-bits string .",
    "alice and bob send the    calculated strings @xmath40 and @xmath41    separately to tp via a public channel .",
    "osb7 : : :    tp generates a classical bit string @xmath42 of    @xmath13-bits corresponding to the choice of the initial bell    states in obs1 , such that for the @xmath39th bell state being    @xmath43    @xmath44 he generates    @xmath39th bit value in @xmath42 as 0 ( 1 ) .",
    "osb8 : : :    tp computes @xmath45 , which is exclusive - or result of    @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 as    @xmath46 .",
    "the    bit value 0 ( 1 ) of @xmath47 corresponds to the same    ( different ) values of @xmath48 and    @xmath49 .",
    "thus , iff    @xmath50 both    alice and bob have the same amount of assets .",
    "checking values of    @xmath47 , tp announces whether alice and bob have equal    amount of assets .",
    "interestingly , following similar argument , the existing controlled qd scheme proposed by some of the present authors in ref .",
    "@xcite can also be modified to design a completely orthogonal - state - based qpc protocol .",
    "however , we are not interested to elaborately discuss another orthogonal - state - based scheme . instead , here , we prefer to propose another foundationally relevant scheme which can work with limited quantum resources .",
    "now , we would try to design a semi - quantum protocol for qpc .",
    "in which , tp would be considered as the only quantum party ( i.e. , possess quantum resources ) while both alice and bob are classical parties . in convention ,",
    "a classical party can only access and process classical piece of information , i.e. , can only work in the computational basis @xcite .",
    "thus , being classical user , alice and bob can only measure and prepare qubits in computational basis .",
    "additionally , they can reflect the qubits without disturbing them .",
    "the first semi - quantum protocol of key distribution ( sqkd ) was introduced in 2007 @xcite .",
    "in which an unconditionally secure quantum key was shared between a classical and quantum party by using measure and resend @xcite and permutation of particles @xcite techniques to avoid eavesdropping . in what follows",

    "in other words , we assume that alice and bob know @xmath51 before they start following protocol for semi - quantum private comparison .",
    "sq1 : : :    same as osb1 , with the only difference that the number of epr states    prepared is @xmath52 sq2 : : :    @xmath15 and @xmath16 the classical users alice    and bob , respectively . as mentioned beforehand",

    "they also store the bit    values obtained in their measurement outcome corresponding to each    measured qubit .",
    "sq4 : : :    after receiving all the qubits from alice and bob , tp performs bell    measurements on the received pairs of qubits ( i.e. ,    @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",

    "we have explicitly shown all the    cases when the initial state was @xmath56 or    @xmath57 .",
    "it is only case 4 , which is of    interest , because only this case leads to successful key sharing    between alice and bob .",
    "case 1 is used for eavesdropping checking ,    i.e. , tp s announcement `` 1 '' for the qubits corresponding to case 1    may be considered as the signature of disturbance caused by eve .",

    "this case would lead to a    key .",
    "sq5 : : :    after the announcement of tp , both alice and bob disclose the    coordinates of the qubits they have measured .",
    "subsequently , both of    them make two separate lists corresponding to qubits falling in cases    1 and 4 .",
    "then , alice and bob check eavesdropping using semi - quantum    subroutine using qubits of case 1 . in which , both the classical    parties ensure that tp s measurement outcome is 0 when both have    reflected the qubits ( case 1 ) . in this case , about one - fourth of the    initial states ( i.e. , @xmath62 bell states ) will be    used for eavesdropping checking .",
    "if the errors are found to be lower    than a tolerable limit , they proceed to the next step , otherwise they    discard the scheme , and restart from sq1 .",
    "+    on the successful completion of this step ( i.e. , if the error rate is    found to be less than the tolerable limit ) , alice and bob obtain    @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively ,    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are    correlated strings of length @xmath62-bits .",
    "sq6 : : :    on request of alice and bob , tp discloses his initial choices of bell    states for @xmath13 cases , that are selected randomly .    subsequently , using the values of @xmath65 and    @xmath66 ,",
    "alice and bob compare the parity values    for the bell states prepared by tp and the bit values obtained by them    for all @xmath13 cases .",
    "if it matches , they proceed , otherwise    they abort .",
    "+    this would check whether tp had genuinely prepared a bell state or    not , which in turn would ensure the correlation in the reduced    @xmath13-bit strings @xmath31 and    @xmath32 .",
    "this disclosure will also be relevant in some of    the intercept and resend attacks of dishonest alice or bob .",
    "this    particular aspect will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "sq7 : : :    same as obs6 .",
    "sq8 : : :    same as obs7 .",
    "sq9 : : :    same as obs8 .",
    "before we analyze the security of the proposed protocols , it would be beneficial to summarize the information known ( or unknown ) to each party . to be specific , in both the protocols proposed in the last section , tp has the information of the initial bell states , which is unknown to both alice and bob .",
    "this ensures 1 bit of ignorance for both alice and bob .",
    "this is so because the initial bell states can be distinguished as parity 0 ( @xmath43 ) state and parity 1 ( @xmath58 ) state . for a parity @xmath27 ( 1 )",
    "state the final key bits obtained by alice and bob would be the same ( complementary of each other ) .",
    "hence , the ignorance due to the lack of knowledge about the initial bell state is 1 bit .",
    "interestingly , the initial choice of bell states also ensure 1 bit of ignorance for tp as he has knowledge about the parity of the initial bell state , but he does not know whether alice s ( or bob s ) measurement outcome was 0 or 1 .",
    "further , alice ( bob ) has the shared quantum key @xmath51 and correlated key @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , which are not known to tp .",
    "it is evident that anyone interested to know the secrets of alice and/or bob ( @xmath35 and/or @xmath36 ) would require all three parts of information .",
    "now , we can consider various possible attacks by each party to gain the information not accessible to them .",
    "for example , tp can try to take benefit of state preparation by preparing a state other than bell state to gain advantage by entanglement swapping attack @xcite .",
    "in fact , he can prepare an arbitrary quantum state to exploit the state preparation , and try to extract correlated keys @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , the unconditional security of the quantum key @xmath51 would maintain security against any such attempt as both alice and bob encrypt their messages regarding asset information @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively using the quantum key @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , it can be viewed as alice and bob performing communication in a secure manner by using a quantum key and the security of message can be attributed completely to the security of the quantum key .",
    "additionally , alice ( bob ) may wish to extract bob s ( alice s ) key @xmath32 ( @xmath31 ) by designing an intercept and resend attack @xcite . the eavesdropping checking mechanism adopted in both the protocols ( by gv and semi - quantum subroutines ,",
    "respectively ) ensures security against this kind of an attack .",
    "it may be noted that the eavesdropping checking procedure adopted here would provide security against both insider and outsider attackers .",
    "a modified intercept and resend attack strategy by a classical alice ( bob ) in sqpc scheme could be to intercept all the qubits sent to bob ( alice ) and keep them in a memory .",
    "though , possession of a quantum memory by a classical party is beyond his / her limits , but it is an interesting scenario to be investigated .",
    "suppose alice measures half of the qubits which tp has sent to her , and follows the same for the corresponding bob s qubits in her possession .",
    "depending upon the outcomes of her measurement , alice prepares new qubits and sends ( the same number of qubits tp would have sent ) them to bob after adding the remaining auxiliary qubits .",
    "bob proceeds with the protocol as expected , then alice intercepts all the qubits bob returns to tp and replaces them with the qubits ( initially sent by tp to bob ) in her possession .",
    "using this approach , she will get @xmath32 completely as it will be prepared using a subset of the string of qubits , she had measured and sent to bob . though this kind of an attack can be circumvented by bob s critical analysis of the final key ( ideally ( i.e. , when alice has not made any attempt to attack the protocol ) , in all those cases , where bob has measured and resend his qubit while alice has not measured her qubit , tp s announcement should have almost equal probabilities for 0 and 1 . however ,",
    "if alice has performed this attack , then tp would broadcast 0s for all these cases . ) .",
    "further , a standard solution would be a strict time checking .",
    "in which , tp announces the sending time of the qubits . using this fact , and the time of receipt of the qubits both alice and bob can check the travel time and discard the protocol if they find any anomaly .",
    "the qubit efficiency of the proposed qpc protocols can be calculated using the quantitative measure proposed in refs .",
    "the efficiency @xmath67 where @xmath68 number of classical bits are transmitted using the total number of @xmath69 qubits , and @xmath70-bits classical communication is involved .",
    "it should be noted that only the classical communication used for decoding the message is considered , not the classical communication required for eavesdropping checking . in both the orthogonal - state - based qpc and sqpc protocols , alice and",
    "bob share their @xmath13-bit secrets , contributing equally in @xmath71 .",
    "the orthogonal - state - based qpc involves @xmath72 qubits , which are shared in a secure manner using @xmath72 number of additional decoy qubits .",
    "finally , alice and bob announce @xmath73 of @xmath13-bits each which is followed by 1 bit of classical communication by tp ( i.e. , the announcement that discloses whether the assets are equal ( say , 0 ) or not ( say , 1 ) ) .",
    "additionally , alice and bob also share a quantum key and the qubits and bits used to obtain this shared key should also be counted in the computation of efficiency . here , we have chosen orthogonal - state - based qka scheme @xcite for considering the resources involved in sharing the quantum key . using shukla",
    "et al.s scheme @xcite , and exploiting the dense coding capacity of the quantum channel used , an @xmath13-bit quantum key can be shared by two parties using @xmath74 qubits ( @xmath72 as quantum channel and @xmath72 decoy qubits ) , which involves @xmath75-bit classical communication .",
    "therefore , total number of qubits used are @xmath76 * * with additional classical communication * @xmath77*. thus , the efficiency of the orthogonal - state - based qpc protocol would be @xmath78 , which becomes 15.38% for large @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , in case of sqpc protocol , @xmath79 qubits are initially prepared by tp , subsequently @xmath80 qubits are prepared by alice and bob ( @xmath74 by each ) as a replacement of the qubits measured by them .",
    "tp announces @xmath80 bit measurement outcomes which alice and bob use to generate their keys with the help of @xmath74 bit of classical messages available with each of them .",
    "finally , alice and bob both share an @xmath13-bit encrypted messages which helps tp to obtain and announce 1 bit final result .",
    "additionally , both classical parties also share a secure quantum key @xcite for which they use @xmath81 bits ( i.e. , tp initially prepares @xmath79 qubits , and alice ( bob ) prepares additional @xmath74 ( @xmath74 ) qubits ) .",
    "similar to the sqpc protocol , tp also announces @xmath80-bit classical communication which is followed by @xmath74-bit announcement by both alice and bob .",
    "it is important to note that alice and bob keep the bit values only for specific announcements by tp . here",
    ", we have considered the asymptotic case where equal probabilities for favorable and unfavorable measurement outcomes of tp has been considered . using all these values",
    "the efficiency of the sqpc protocol is @xmath82 . for large values of @xmath13 ,",

    "we will also study the effect of pauli noise , which affects the qubit independent of its initial state with a certain probability and leaves it unaffected with the remaining probability .",
    "the error caused due to this kind of noise can be studied as bit flip ( bf ) , phase flip ( pf ) , and depolarizing channel ( dc ) noise .    2 .",
    ": :    * bit flip channels : * the bf channel , which flips the qubit with    probability @xmath91 and leaves it unchanged with remaining    probability , can be given by the kraus operators @xcite    @xmath92 and    @xmath93 .",

    "it is interesting that the effect of phase damping noise    on certain scheme can be reduced from the obtained results for phase    flip channels ( @xcite and references therein ) , so we have not    explicitly studied the phase damping kind of noise .",

    "we will use a distance based measure , fidelity , between the quantum state received by the receivers ( alice and bob here ) after the effect of a specific noise channel and the quantum state expected in the ideal condition , when noisy channel do not alter the quantum state .",

    "therefore , the fidelity between the initial ( @xmath100 ) and final ( @xmath85 ) state is @xmath105 here , it is also worth mentioning that the fidelity expression used here is square of the conventional fidelity expression but is also used widely as a measure ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "now , we will discuss the effect of all these noise models on the proposed schemes .",
    "it is noteworthy that the qubits used by alice and bob to prepare their respective keys undergo the same fate in both the schemes .",
    "therefore , the discussion what follows is applicable to both orthogonal - state - based qpc and sqpc protocols . specifically , when both the qubits of the initial state @xmath43 are subjected to ad noise the compact analytic expression of the obtained fidelity is    @xmath106    where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the probabilities of errors in the first and second qubits , respectively .",

    "specifically , we have already mentioned the fidelity between the initial and final state in the ideal conditions is expected to be unity . for the sake of argument , consider that one of the channel ( either tp to alice or tp to bob ) is noiseless , then this unit fidelity falls considerably ( cf .",

    "two protocols for qpc have been proposed .",
    "the essential beauty of the present work underlies in the fact that both of the proposed protocols for qpc are fundamentally different from all the existing protocols of qpc . specifically , the first protocol is designed solely using orthogonal states and the security of the protocol does not rely on conjugate coding .",
    "this is interesting because of the fact that bb84 protocol @xcite for qkd and early protocols of secure quantum communication ( see chapter 8 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , whose security arise from the fact that one can not perform simultaneous measurements in mutually unbiased bases ( conjugate coding ) , led to a perception that unconditional security of qkd and other quantum tasks arises from the conjugate coding ( i.e. , through the use of non - orthogonal states as the states prepared in mutually unbiased bases are not orthogonal to each other ) .",
    "interestingly , in refs . @xcite it has been firmly established that qkd is possible without using non - orthogonal states , i.e. , by using orthogonal states only .",
    "subsequently , a set of orthogonal - state - based protocols for various secure quantum communication tasks has been proposed by some of the present authors @xcite , and those protocols have established that most of the quantum cryptographic tasks that can be performed using non - orthogonal states can also be performed using orthogonal states . specifically , it has been established that one can perform quantum secure direct communication @xcite , qka @xcite , etc . , solely using orthogonal states .",
    "these orthogonal - state - based protocols are fundamentally different from the conjugate coding based schemes as their security does not arise from our inability to perform simultaneous measurement using two mutually unbiased bases .",

    "thus , the first protocol of the present paper is fundamentally different from all the existing protocols for qpc , and it is unique in that sense .",
    "interestingly , the second protocol proposed here is also an orthogonal - state - based , but in the case of the second protocol we did not stress much on this characteristic , because it has another unique characteristic , which has not been explored in any of the existing schemes for qpc : the protocol is semi - quantum in nature , i.e. , it allows some of the users to be classical .",

    "it establishes that conjugate coding is not required and ensuring simultaneous non - availability of all the pieces of information to eve after splitting it into several pieces is sufficient to ensure security of schemes for qpc .",
    "specifically , conjugate - coding - based schemes achieve security by hiding the basis information of two mutually unbiased bases , whereas an orthogonal - state - based employs geographical information splitting using pop technique .",

    "specifically , the qubit efficiency of the sqpc protocol ( i.e. , our second protocol ) is found to be much lower compared to the first protocol where all the users are quantum in nature .",
    "clearly , this happens because in sqpc , a lesser number of parties possess quantum resources and that increases the requirement of @xmath69 and @xmath70 for accomplishing the same task ( i.e. , to communicate the same amount of classical information @xmath68 by following the restrictions of the same cryptographic task ) .",

    "however , it is observed that when both the qubits are subjected to ad noise , the fidelity expressions depend on the parity of the bell state .",
    "further , the study has established that the quantum state is least affected due to dc illustrated through a higher value of fidelity .",
    "interestingly , it has also been observed that the higher error rates in one of the quantum channel can also lead to positive effects .",
    "specifically , a few cases have been observed where the higher decoherence rate in one of the quantum channel had resulted in higher fidelity compared to the situation having lower error rates in the same channel .",
