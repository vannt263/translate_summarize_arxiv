    "one of the predictions of quantum chromodynamics is the possible existence of a deconfined state of quarks and gluons . in relativistic heavy ion collisions , under certain conditions ( sufficiently high energy density and temperature )",
    "ordinary hadronic matter ( where quarks and gluons are confined ) can undergo a phase transition to deconfined matter , commonly known as quark gluon plasma . over the years , nuclear physicists are trying to produce and detect this new phase of matter , first at cern sps and now at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "indeed , it has even been claimed that evidence of new state of matter is already seen at pb+pb collisions at cern sps@xcite .",
    "the claim was based mainly on the experimental @xmath0 suppression and strangeness enhancement . due to intrinsic ambiguities in disentangling similar effects arising from hadronic processes ,",
    "the claim is considered to be rather controversial .",
    "@xmath0 suppression is recognized as an important tool to identify the possible phase transition to quark - gluon plasma . because of the large mass of the charm quarks ,",
    "@xmath1 pairs are produced on a short time scale .",
    "their tight binding also makes them immune to final state interactions .",
    "their evolution probes the state of matter in the early stage of the collisions .",
    "matsui and satz @xcite predicted that in presence of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , due to screening of color force , binding of @xmath1 pairs into @xmath0 meson will be hindered , leading to the so called @xmath0 suppression in heavy ion collisions @xcite . over the years",
    "several groups have measured the @xmath0 yield in heavy ion collisions ( for a review of the data and the interpretations see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in brief ,",
    "experimental data do show suppression .",
    "however this could be attributed to the conventional nuclear absorption , also present in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the latest data obtained by the na50 collaboration @xcite on j/@xmath3 production in pb+pb collisions at 158 a gev is the first indication of the anomalous mechanism of charmonium suppression , which goes beyond the conventional suppression in a nuclear environment .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 yield to that of drell - yan pairs decreases faster with @xmath4 in the most central collisions than in the less central ones .",
    "it has been suggested that the resulting pattern can be understood in a deconfinement scenario in terms of successive melting of charmonium bound states @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that the data can be understood as an effect of transverse energy fluctuations in central heavy ion collisions . introducing a factor @xmath5 , assuming that the suppression is 100% above a threshold density ( a parameter in the model ) , and smearing the threshold density ( at the expense of another parameter ) the best fit to the data was obtained . extending the blaizot s model to include fluctuations in number of nn collisions at a fixed impact parameter",
    ", na50 data could be fitted with a single parameter , the threshold density , above which all the @xmath0 mesons melt @xcite .",
    "assumption that all the @xmath0 mesons melt above a threshold density , implicitly assume that a qgp like environment is produced in the collisions .",
    "na50 data could also be explained in the conventional approach , without invoking qgp like scenario .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data in the comover approach .",
    "there also , the comover density has to be modified by the factor @xmath6 .",
    "introduction of this adhoc factor @xmath6 can be justified in a model based on excited nucleons represented by strings @xcite .",
    "recently we have shown that the na50 data is well explained in a qcd based model @xcite , where formation of @xmath0 from @xmath1 pair is suppressed , due to gain in the relative square momentum of @xmath1 pair as it moves through a nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "some of the @xmath1 pair can gain enough square momenta to cross the open charm threshold , thereby reducing the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "the model predicted large suppression of @xmath0 at rhic energy , in agreement with other model predictions .    in the present paper",
    "we have extended our earlier analysis of na50 data of transverse energy dependence of @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio @xcite , to include the transverse energy dependence of @xmath0 over mb ratio and the dy over mb ratio .",
    "recently capella et al @xcite observed that on the average , a @xmath0 and also a dy event has @xmath7 3 gev less than a minimum bias event .",
    "@xmath4 loss in a @xmath0(dy ) event , though small , can have larger effect beyond the knee of the @xmath4 distribution .",
    "we have also studied the effect of @xmath4 loss in @xmath0 and in dy events .",
    "we confirm the analysis of capella et al @xcite that in the ratio @xmath0 over dy , @xmath4 loss effect gets cancelled .",
    "but the effect is manifested in the ratio of @xmath0 over mb as well as in the ratio of dy over mb .",
    "next , we apply the model to predict @xmath4 dependence of @xmath0 suppression in au+au collisions at rhic energy . at rhic energy",
    ", hard scattering may be important .",
    "suppression increases with hard scattering .",
    "it is also shown that @xmath0 over minimum bias ratio can be used to obtain fraction of hard scattering in the collision .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly present the model of @xmath0 production and absorption in aa collisions . in section 3 ,",
    "we obtain the transverse energy distribution in pb+pb collisions . in section 4 ,",
    "relevant formula s for @xmath0 , dy and mb cross sections will be noted .",
    "analysis of na50 data on the centrality dependence of the ratio s , @xmath0/mb , dy / mb and @xmath0/dy will be presented in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we will show predicted @xmath0 suppression pattern in au+au collisions at rhic energy .",
    "summary and conclusions will be given in section 7 .",
    "qiu , vary and zhang @xcite proposed a model to describe the @xmath0 suppression in nucleon - nucleus / nucleus - nucleus collisions . for the sake of completeness , we will briefly describe the model .",
    "qiu , vary and zhang assumed that the production of @xmath0 meson is a two step process , ( i ) production of @xmath8 pairs with relative momentum square @xmath9 , and ( ii ) formation of @xmath0 mesons from the @xmath1 pairs . step ( i ) can be accurately calculated in qcd .",
    "the second step , formation of @xmath0 mesons from initially compact @xmath1 pairs is non - perturbative .",
    "they used a parametric form for the step ( ii ) , formation of @xmath0 from @xmath1 pairs .",
    "the @xmath0 cross section in @xmath10 collisions , at center of mass energy @xmath11 was then written as ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 runs over all parton flavors , and @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 factor takes into account the higher order corrections .",
    "the incoming parton momentum fractions are fixed by kinematics and are @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "quark annihilation and gluon fusion are the major sub processes for @xmath1 production . in the leading log ,",
    "they are given by @xcite ,    @xmath18 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the qcd running coupling constant and @xmath20 .",
    "in eq.[1 ] @xmath21 is the transition probability that a @xmath1 pair with relative momentum square @xmath9 evolve into a physical @xmath0 meson . in a nucleon - nucleus / nucleus - nucleus collision",
    ", the produced @xmath1 pairs interact with nuclear medium before they exit . observed anomalous nuclear enhancement of the momentum imbalance in dijet production led qiu , vary and zhang @xcite to argue that the interaction of a @xmath1 pair with nuclear environment increases the square of the relative momentum between the @xmath1 pair . as a result , some of the @xmath1 pairs can gain enough relative square momentum to cross the threshold to become an open charm meson .",
    "consequently , the cross sections for @xmath0 production are reduced in comparison with nucleon - nucleon cross section . if the @xmath0 meson travel a distance @xmath22 , the transition probability @xmath23 in eq.[1 ] will be changed to ,    @xmath24    with @xmath25 being the relative square momentum gain per unit length .",
    "qiu , vary and zhang @xcite considered three different parametric forms ( representing different physical processes ) for the transition probability",
    ". all the three forms could describe the experimental energy dependence of total @xmath0 cross section in hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "however , only the following form ,    @xmath26    could describe the experimental @xmath0 data as a function of effective nuclear length @xcite . in fig.1 ,",
    "we have shown the fit obtained to na50 experimental data @xcite on the @xmath0 total cross section as a function of effective nuclear length .",
    "we have used cteq5 m parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the parameter values , @xmath27=0.458 , @xmath25=0.225 @xmath28 and @xmath29=1 are very close to the values obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have assumed that the probability to obtain @xmath4 at impact parameter @xmath30 can be parameterized as ,    @xmath31    the mean value of the transverse energy is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the average transverse energy per participant , and the dispersion is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a dimensionless parameter . the number of participants @xmath36 at impact parameter @xmath37 is calculated as ,    @xmath38    where the transverse density @xmath39 is ,    @xmath40   +    t_b({\\bf    b - s } )    [ 1    - e^{-\\sigma_{nn } t_a({\\bf s})}],\\ ] ]    nuclear thickness function , @xmath41 contain all the nuclear information . in the present calculation , we have used the following parametric form for @xmath42 @xcite ,    @xmath43    with a=0.53 fm , @xmath44 .",
    "the central density is obtained from @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath35 were obtained by fitting na50 experimental transverse energy distribution .",
    "na50 collaboration @xcite did not correct the @xmath4 spectra for the efficiency of target identification algorithm , which is lower than unity for @xmath4 lower than 60 gev . to obtain the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath35",
    "we have fitted the purely inclusive part of the @xmath4 spectra ( @xmath46 60 gev ) .",
    "the fit is shown in fig.2 .",
    "it was obtained with @xmath33=0.274 gev and @xmath35=1.97 .",
    "here we present in brief , the relevant formula s for calculating minimum bias , drell - yan and @xmath0 cross sections .",
    "minimum bias cross sections are easy to calculate .",
    "it is essentially the inelastic cross - section . in the glauber model , at impact parameter @xmath30 minimum bias cross section can be calculated as ,    @xmath47    the drell - yan pairs do not suffer any final state interactions and the cross section at an impact parameter @xmath48 as a function of @xmath4 can be written as ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the drell - yan cross section in @xmath51 collisions .    while drell - yan pairs do not suffer interactions with nuclear matter , the @xmath0 mesons do . in the present model suppression factor",
    "depend on the length traversed by the @xmath1 mesons in nuclear medium .",
    "consequently , we write the @xmath0 cross section at an impact parameter @xmath30 as ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the @xmath0 cross section in @xmath51 collisions and @xmath54 is the suppression factor due to passage through a length l in nuclear environment .",
    "the length @xmath55 that the @xmath0 meson will traverse can be obtained as ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the transverse density [ eq.[15 ] ] .",
    "suppression factor @xmath58 can be calculated using eq.[1 ] , noting that a @xmath1 pair gains relative square momentum @xmath25 , traversing a square of length @xmath22 .",
    "parametric value of @xmath25 , as shown before , was obtained by fitting nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus @xmath0 cross section data containing all @xmath4",
    ". however , eq.[14 ] corresponds to a particular @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , square momentum gain factor needs to be modified .",
    "we modify the momentum gain factor @xmath25 to take into account the @xmath4 dependence as ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the momentum gain factor for all @xmath4 ( which was obtained by fitting experimental data ) .",
    "@xmath61 is the length through which a @xmath0 meson with transverse energy @xmath4 will travel .",
    "the length @xmath61 can be calculated as @xcite ,    @xmath62 p(b , e_t )   }   { 2 \\rho_0 \\int d^2b d^2s t_a({\\bf s } ) t_b({\\bf b - s } ) p(b , e_t)}.\\ ] ]    fluctuations of transverse energy at a fixed impact parameter plays an important role in the explanation of the na50 data . above 100 gev ,",
    "i.e. , approximately at the position of the knee , the 2nd drop in the data is due to the fluctuations in @xmath4 . in order to account for the fluctuations , following capella et al @xcite , we calculate ,    @xmath63    where ,    @xmath64    the function @xmath65 is unity up to the knee of the distribution , and increases thereafter , precisely where the fluctuations dominate .",
    "the replacement ,    @xmath66    then properly accounts for the fluctuations in the @xmath4 distributions .",
    "capella et al @xcite observed that in a @xmath0 event sample and also in a dy event sample , @xmath7 3 gev is taken by the trigger and thus the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter by the other hadrons is slightly less than the corresponding one in a minimum bias event sample . the @xmath4 loss in a @xmath0 event ,",
    "though very small , can have larger effect in the ratio of @xmath0 over mb at the tail of the @xmath4 distribution .",
    "however , in the ratio of @xmath0 over dy the effect of @xmath4 loss cancels out .",
    "exact magnitude of @xmath4 loss in a @xmath0 event is difficult to estimate .",
    "capella et al @xcite single out the nn collision in which @xmath0 ( or dy ) is produced and assumed that in that collision , no other hadrons are produced .",
    "we have implemented this in the present calculation by replacing the number of participants @xmath36 in a @xmath0 or dy event by ,    @xmath67    minimum number of participants being two .    in fig.3 , we have compared the model prediction for the transverse energy dependence of @xmath0 over drell - yan ratio , with the na50 experimental data .",
    "we have assumed the normalization factor @xmath68=53.5 @xcite .",
    "the solid line is the model prediction , obtained without @xmath4 loss consideration .",
    "identical result is obtained when @xmath4 loss effect is taken into consideration . in the @xmath0 over dy ratio ,",
    "the effect get cancelled to a high accuracy .",
    "the model gives good description to the na50 data .",
    "the 2nd drop in the ratio at 100 gev is reproduced .",
    "we note that without @xmath4 fluctuations , that drop is not reproduced .",
    "the result clearly shows that it is not essential to assume a deconfined scenario to explain the na50 data on centrality dependence of @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio .",
    "nuclear absorption alone is capable of explaining the data .    in fig.4 , na50 data @xcite on the centrality dependence of the drell - yan over minimum bias ratio",
    "the data were taken in 1996 using a thick target .",
    "na50 collaboration does not consider the data reliable beyond the knee of the @xmath4 distribution , due to possible contamination of rescattering in the thick target . the solid line is a fit obtained to the data without @xmath4 loss effect .",
    "the ratio saturates beyond 100 gev . when effect of @xmath4 loss in a dy event is taken into consideration ( the dashed line ) the ratio drops beyond 100 gev .",
    "the effect is significant . at large @xmath4 ,",
    "the ratio drops by more than 60% when @xmath4 loss effect is included . indeed",
    ", experimental data do show such a drop , but as told earlier the data are not reliable beyond 100 gev .",
    "the prediction can easily be verified in future experiments .",
    "na50 collaboration reported the preliminary analysis of centrality dependence of @xmath0 over mb ratio @xcite .",
    "in fig.5 , we have shown the preliminary data .",
    "the ratio increases up to the knee of the @xmath4 distribution , there after it decreases .",
    "there is an indication of change in slope around @xmath4=40 gev . in fig.5 ,",
    "dashed and solid lines are model calculations , obtained with and without @xmath4 loss effect .",
    "the model predictions agree with experimental data .",
    "the change of slope around @xmath4=40 gev is also reproduced . as with dy / mb ratio ,",
    "the two predictions differ only beyond 100 gev , where @xmath4 fluctuations dominate . with @xmath4 loss taken into account ,",
    "the ratio drops faster , fitting the data better . here also , the effect is significant , 60% or more at large @xmath4 .",
    "na50 collaboration analyzed the @xmath0 data in two distinct manner .",
    "one is the standard analysis , in which the ratio of @xmath0 over drell - yan ( dy ) was measured . in the other , which is called minimum bias ( mb ) analysis ,",
    "the drell - yan events were replaced by the minimum bias events .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 over minimum bias cross section was then divided by the ratio of theoretical dy over minimum bias cross section to obtain    @xmath69    the standard analysis data cover only up to the knee of the @xmath4-distribution .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0 over dy ratio beyond the knee of the @xmath4-distribution is obtained entirely from the minimum bias analysis . without @xmath4 loss effect , dy / mb remain practically constant beyond 100 gev , and therefore the behavior of @xmath0 over dy and that of @xmath0 over mb is practically the same .",
    "however , present calculations clearly indicate that , due to @xmath4 loss effect , dy / mb does not remain constant but changes quite significantly in this @xmath4 range .",
    "then behavior of @xmath0 over mb and that of @xmath0 over dy are not the same .",
    "true ratio will be flatter than obtained from the minimum bias analysis . as suggested by capella et al , it is better not to superimpose two analysis in a single figure",
    ". models can be tested better by fitting them separately .",
    "present model can be used to predict centrality dependence of @xmath0 over dy in au+au collisions at rhic energy .",
    "experimental @xmath4 distribution at rhic energy is not available , but we can make an educated guess for it .    recent phobos experiment @xcite showed that for central collisions , total multiplicity is larger by 70% at rhic than at sps .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is correspondingly increased @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we rescale the @xmath4 distribution for pb+pb collisions and assume that it represent the experimental @xmath4 distribution for au+au collisions at rhic ( small mass difference between au and pb is neglected ) . at rhic energy ,",
    "the so - called hard component , which is proportional to the number of binary collision , appears .",
    "model dependent calculations indicate that the hard component grows from 22% to 37% as the energy changes from @xmath11=56 gev to 130 gev @xcite .",
    "however we choose to ignore the hard component in @xmath4-distribution .",
    "the multiplicity distribution obtained by the phobos collaboration , in the rapidity range @xmath70 could be fitted well with or without this hard component .",
    "indeed , it appears that the data are fitted without the hard component @xcite .",
    "global distribution e.g. multiplicity or transverse energy distributions are not sensitive to the hard component .    in fig.6 ,",
    "filled circles represent the `` experimental '' @xmath4 distribution for au+au collisions at rhic , obtained by scaling the @xmath4 distribution in pb+pb collisions at sps .",
    "the solid line is a fit to the `` experimental '' @xmath4-distribution obtained with @xmath33=.46 gev and @xmath35=1.97 .",
    "nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section ( @xmath71 ) was assumed to be 41 mb at rhic , instead of 32 mb at sps @xcite .    while the @xmath4 distribution at rhic energy may not depend on the so - called hard component which is proportional to number of binary collisions ,",
    "@xmath0 suppression will strongly depend on the hard component , as it effectively increases the density of the nuclear medium . for @xmath72 fraction of hard scattering , transverse density @xmath73 in eq.[15 ]",
    "is modified to @xcite ,    @xmath74    with @xmath75 . with hard component , transverse density",
    "is increased , as a result , suppression will be increased at rhic energy . in fig.7 ,",
    "solid line is the predicted centrality dependence of the @xmath0/dy ratio without any hard scattering component in the transverse density .",
    "suppression pattern is similar to that in pb+pb collisions at sps energy .",
    "the 2nd drop now shifts at higher @xmath4 .",
    "with 37% hard scattering component in the transverse density ( the dashed line ) suppression increases and the effect of @xmath4 fluctuations , i.e. the second drop is washed out . in fig.7 , we have shown the prediction ( dotted line ) obtained in a model where all the @xmath0 s melts down above a threshold density @xcite .",
    "the prediction also included 37% hard scattering .",
    "it agrees closely with the present model prediction ( dashed line ) .",
    "assumption of @xmath0 s melting above a threshold density implicitly assume qgp like environment is produced in the collision .",
    "very similar prediction for @xmath0 suppression in a confined scenario and in a deconfined scenario , raises the possibility that it may not be possible to confirm the deconfinement phase transition , even at rhic energy , from the @xmath0 data .",
    "recently several authors have proposed that at rhic energy , in a deconfined scenario , recombination of @xmath1 pairs will lead to enhancement of @xmath0 s , rather than its suppression @xcite .",
    "inclusion of recombination effects may mask the large suppression obtained in a deconfined scenario . however , nuclear suppression as calculated presently will remain unaltered",
    ". it may then be possible to distinguish the deconfinement phase transition from the @xmath0 data .",
    "we have also calculated the centrality dependence of @xmath76 and of @xmath77 ratio s at rhic energy .",
    "centrality dependence of @xmath77 is very similar to that obtained in pb+pb collisions at sps energy and is not shown .",
    "centrality dependence of @xmath0 over mb ratio is shown in fig.8 .",
    "the upper panel was obtained without any hard scattering component in the transverse density , while in the lower panel , hard scattering ( 37% ) was included .",
    "as before , effect of @xmath4 loss is observed only beyond the knee of the @xmath4 distribution .",
    "it is interesting to note the difference in the shape of the ratio . without hard scattering component ,",
    "the ratio increases with @xmath4 up to the knee of the @xmath4 distribution , then decreases , a dependence similar to pb+pb data at sps energy . with hard scattering",
    "included , the ratio increases at low @xmath4 , then remains more or less same up to the knee of the @xmath4 distribution . beyond the knee",
    ", it decreases again .",
    "very distinct shape of the two distributions can be used to determine experimentally the fraction of hard processes in the collision .",
    "we have studied the na50 data on @xmath0 suppression in pb+pb collisions at sps energy .",
