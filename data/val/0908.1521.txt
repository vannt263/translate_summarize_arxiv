    "nuclear matter is a hypothetical very large system of nucleons where the coulomb effects of protons are switched off .",
    "such a system is expected to have features of liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "we consider here the equation of state of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter at temperature between 4 and 10 mev and at less than half of normal nuclear density .",
    "we assume that at equilibrium at finite temperature ( three to tens of mev ) and low average density , nuclear matter breaks up into fragments , each with normal nuclear density .",
    "strong support to this assumption comes from data on heavy ion collisions but it is also supported by theoretical modelling .",
    "for example it can be easily shown ( see section iv in @xcite ) , using skyrme type interaction , that the free energy of uniformly stretched nuclear matter is very significantly lowered if the matter is allowed to split into many fragments , each with normal nuclear density .",
    "this is the multifragmentation model .",
    "we use this model to study thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter , particularly phase - equilibrium lines ( the lines of co - existence of liquid and gas phases ) in the @xmath0 plane for both symmetric and asymmetric matter .",
    "this is an extension of the model described in our earlier work @xcite where only one kind of particles was considered .",
    "this one kind of particles however formed clusters whose properties were patterned after actual finite nuclei .",
    "while we hope that the present article is self - contained we will refer to this earlier work for elucidation of some points .",
    "there is a large number of publications on equation of state and phase transitions in nuclear matter .",
    "@xcite comes closest to the spirit of this paper . while there are quite a few common features with this work there are also some differences and we highlight some other aspects .",
    "phase transition in nuclear matter using mean - field theory was studied over many years and we can not attempt an adequate bibliography here .",
    "we mention two papers which critically looked at asymmetric nuclear matter and received a great deal of attention in very recent times @xcite . both of these use mean - field theories and overcome the difficulty of instability through maxwell construction .",
    "the multifragmentation approach is very different .",
    "it is more directly related to actual observables but in its present form it can only be trusted in a low density regime .",
    "but there is no need for maxwell construction .",
    "we briefly review the grand canonical model for multifragmentation @xcite . let the numbers of neutrons and protons in the dissociating system be @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . at finite temperature and in subnormal densities",
    ", these will break up into all possible composites each with some neutrons(@xmath3 ) and protons ( @xmath4)(mass number @xmath5 ) .",
    "we always use the subscripted @xmath6 to refer to the very large system whose thermodynamic properties are being investigated whereas @xmath7 refer to composites which can be small or large .",
    "the properties of the composites are determined by the basic two - body interactions these properties are utilized in the model but interactions between composites are neglected ( except through excluded volume effect ; see discussion later ) by appealing to the short range nature of nuclear forces .",
    "this limits the validity of the model to low densities . here",
    "we will restrict our investigation to densities @xmath8 to 0.5 or less where @xmath9 is the normal nuclear density .",
    "this is the customary practice @xcite .",
    "if the neutron chemical potential is @xmath10 and the proton chemical potential is @xmath11 , then statistical equilibrium implies that the chemical potential of a composite with @xmath3 neutrons and @xmath4 protons is @xmath12 .",
    "the following are the relevant equations for us .",
    "the average number of composites with @xmath3 neutrons and @xmath4 is ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a one body partition function for the composite @xmath16 .",
    "it is a product of two factors ; one arising from the translational motion of the composite and another from the intrinsic partition function of the composite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the volume available for translational motion ; @xmath18 will be less than @xmath19 , the volume to which the system has expanded at break up ( excluded volume correction ) .",
    "we use @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the normal volume of nucleus with @xmath2 protons and @xmath1 neutrons .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 depends upon the intrinsic properties of the composites and contains all the nuclear physics .",
    "we list now the properties of the composites used in this work .",
    "the proton and the neutron are fundamental building blocks thus @xmath23 where 2 takes care of the spin degeneracy .",
    "for deuteron , triton , @xmath24he and @xmath25he we use @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ground state energy of the composite and @xmath28 is the experimental spin degeneracy of the ground state . because we are modeling a system where protons do not carry any charges the ground state energy of @xmath24he",
    "is taken to be that of the triton and the coulomb energy is subtracted from the experimental energy of the alpha particle .",
    "these modifications make insignificant changes .",
    "excited states for these very low mass nuclei are not included .",
    "for mass number @xmath29 and greater we use the liquid - drop formula .",
    "this reads @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the internal free energy of species @xmath32 : @xmath33 the expression includes the volume energy , the temperature dependent surface energy and the symmetry energy .",
    "the values of the paprameters are taken from @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath34 represents contribution from excited states since the composites are at a non - zero temperature . for nuclei with @xmath35=5",
    "we include @xmath4=2 and 3 and for @xmath35=6 we include @xmath4=2,3 and 4 . for higher masses",
    "we compute the drip lines using the liquid - drop formula above and include all isotopes within these boundaries .",
    "there are two equations which determine @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 we want to point out the following feature of the grand canonical model . in all @xmath15 s in the sum in the above two equations , there is one common value for @xmath18 ( see eq.(2 ) ) .",
    "we really solve for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the values of @xmath10 or @xmath11 will not change if we , say , double @xmath40 and @xmath18 simultaneously provided the number of terms in the sum is unaltered .",
    "we then might as well say that when we are solving the grand canonical equation we are really solving for an infinite system ( because we know that fluctuations will become unimportant ) but this infinite system can break up into only certain kinds of species as are included in the above two equations . which composites are included in the sum is an important physical ingredient in the model but intensive quantities like @xmath41 depend not on @xmath40 but on @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    the choice of which nuclei are included in the sum of the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) needs further elucidation .",
    "we can look upon the sum on @xmath3 and @xmath4 as a sum over @xmath35 and a sum over @xmath4 . in principle",
    "@xmath35 goes from 1 to @xmath42 and for a given @xmath35 , @xmath4 can go from 0 to @xmath35 . here for a given @xmath35 we restrict @xmath4 by the drip lines . comparisons with calculations where restrictions by drip lines are not imposed ( as in the copenhagen statistical multifragmentation model ) showed that restrictions by driplines generate imperceptible differences @xcite .",
    "de et al @xcite reach similar conclusion .",
    "let us now consider the restriction on @xmath35 . in principle",
    "this should be @xmath42 but for practical calculations one needs to restrict this to a maximum value that we label as @xmath43 .",
    "earlier calculations with one kind of particles showed that with @xmath44 features of liquid - gas phase transition are not revealed ( see fig.14 in @xcite ) but a high value of @xmath43 at 2000 produces a nearly a perfect model of phase transition ( elaborated in much larger detail in @xcite and in @xcite ) .",
    "we now demonstrate that the multifragmentation model predicts first order phase transition .",
    "there are three signatures we will dwell on .",
    "pressure in the model is given by @xmath45 .",
    "we plot results as function of @xmath46 rather than @xmath47 the connection being @xmath48 .",
    "we have @xmath49 .",
    "we need an asymmetry parameter .",
    "we use both @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we show in fig.1 @xmath52 curves for @xmath53 where the values of @xmath43 are 200 , 400 , 600 , 800 and 1000 .",
    "the temperature used is @xmath54 mev .",
    "for all five choices of @xmath43 pressure against @xmath46 initially rises quite sharply and then flattens out considerably .",
    "the initial stage of fast rise of pressure with density is the gas phase . here",
    "the results do not matter whether @xmath43 is 200 , 400 or larger .",
    "the reason will become clearer later ( it is explained in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "the flattening which follows depend on @xmath43 but above a large enough value of @xmath43 will not change . for one kind of particles",
    "this is reached around 2000 @xcite .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath43=600 is good enough for at least a semi - quantitative estimate of various thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter and we will present results for this value although we did some calculations with other choices of @xmath43 also .",
    "the flattening happens slightly beyond @xmath8=0.1 .",
    "we show results up to @xmath55 arguing that the excluded volume correction for interactions between composites becomes worse with increasing density .",
    "the rise of pressure at small density followed by a flattening of @xmath56 with increasing density is a signature of first - order liquid - gas transition .",
    "we have shown results for t=6.5 mev . beyond a certain temperature",
    "the flatness will disappear showing that there is no more phase transition in the domain @xmath57 .",
    "similarly the flattening of @xmath56 disappears beyond some value of @xmath50 .",
    "the liquid - drop parameters we are using give us for large nuclei the drip - line at @xmath58 ( and of course @xmath59 ) about 2 . hence for larger values of @xmath50 the system can not stay together even at @xmath60=0 .",
    "then we will have a system which has a bound core but always many free nucleons which will dominate the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "this is not a system we want to study .",
    "hence in this work we constrained ourselves to system whose @xmath50 spans 1.0 to 1.8 .",
    "the upper limit is indeed a highly asymmetric system .    below the density where phase transition sets in ,",
    "the system is in pure gas phase . at phase transition point",
    "some liquid will be formed and the fraction of nucleons in the liquid phase will grow at the expense of the gas particles as the density increases .",
    "this can actually be followed .",
    "one also gets a functional definition of what constitutes the gas particles . here",
    "our identification is very different from what is concluded in @xcite but very similar to what is found in our earlier work with one kind of particles @xcite .",
    "lastly , in one component model there is just one @xmath61 which stays constant throughout the co - existence region .",
    "now there are two chemical potentials @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "how do they behave ?",
    "the quantity @xmath62 is the average number of composites with mass number @xmath35 . the quantity @xmath63 gives the fraction of particles tied up in composites with mass number @xmath35 .",
    "this is plotted in figs.2 and 3 for @xmath50=1.0 and @xmath50=1.8 respectively .",
    "first concentrating on fig.2 ( t=6.5 mev ) we see that at density @xmath8=0.1 the nucleons are bound in composites @xmath6450 .",
    "these particles constitute the gas phase . at density @xmath8",
    "= 0.3 some heavy composites with @xmath65 begin to form and the probability of such heavy particles ( with @xmath35 between @xmath43 and @xmath43 - 100 ) begins to increase ( at the expense of the light particles ) as the density increases .",
    "this is a clear evidence of co - existence .",
    "we thus consider light particles ( @xmath66 ) to be gas and heavier particles ( with @xmath35 between @xmath43 and @xmath43 - 135 ) to be liquids .",
    "fig.3 displays similar physics but for @xmath50=1.8 : all gas particles at @xmath8=0.1 and mixture of gas and liquid at @xmath8=0.38 .",
    "we note that even the gas phase in fragmentation model is quite complicated .",
    "it is not just neutrons and protons but other light nuclei as well .",
    "in addition , during co - existence the isotopic content of the gas phase changes continuously as the volume of the container , i.e. density @xmath8 changes .",
    "this is called isospin fractionation and is well - known in literature .",
    "we will briefly come back to this aspect later .",
    "in numerical work involving one kind of particles only @xcite it was demonstrated that in the limit of @xmath67 a constant value of @xmath61 will be achieved in the co - existence region .",
    "this value could be obtained by extrapolation . in the present case",
    "there are two chemical potentials . for @xmath68 , @xmath69 . for @xmath58=1.4 and temperature 6.5 mev",
    "we show in fig.4 the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 as a function of density .",
    "one notices that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 change rapidly in the gas phase and then tend to a constant value . in the limit @xmath67 we expect they will become constants .",
    "we also plot in the same figure @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath61 so defined has a meaning at the three limits:-1 , 0 and + 1 for asymmetry parameter @xmath51 and it is interesting to note that @xmath61 tends to constant value faster than either @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "figure 5 shows that as the temperature increases phase co - existence finally disappears ( from the region @xmath57 ) .",
    "we have shown this for @xmath50=1.0 but this is also true for asymmetric systems provided the asymmetry is not too large as explained earlier .",
    "we show in fig.6 the @xmath52 curves at @xmath60=6.5 mev for three systems with @xmath50=1 , 1.4 and 1.8 .",
    "we can identify from the figure points @xmath71 and @xmath72 on these curves where co - existence sets in .",
    "the values of pressure at these points give us @xmath56 values for co - existence at this temperature for these @xmath50 values .. this is not strictly correct .",
    "the values of @xmath56 increase slightly as one moves towards higher density .",
    "this is because with @xmath43=600 we have not reached asymptotic limits yet .",
    "however , this is adequate for our purpose . repeating this analysis for different temperatures we get co - existence lines in @xmath73 plane for nuclear matter with different asymmetries ( fig.7 ) .",
    "notice that while the co - existence lines for differing asymmetries are different they are quite similar . as usual , points to the left and above the co - existence lines are in the liquid phase and points to the right and below are in the gas phase .",
    "the highest point of a co - existence line in the @xmath73 plane usually identifies critical values @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this is not true in fig.7 . as we consider higher temperatures , points a , b and c ( fig.6 ) will move to the right and up .",
    "they will reach the @xmath75 line .",
    "these define the end - points @xmath76 in fig.7 .",
    "we do not continue to higher densities as the simple approximation of excluded volume as a means of incorporating interactions between clusters becomes progressively worse .",
    "if we accept the validity of the simple multifragmentation model in the region @xmath77 we will have to conclude that the critical point does not exist in the region @xmath78 .",
    "the same conclusion can be guessed from other published work .",
    "multifragmentation with one kind of particles was also studied by bugaev et al @xcite .",
    "this is the same physics problem as considered in @xcite but treated in a different mathematical framework and these authors considered all densities , not just @xmath57 .",
    "they found that one can identify a critical point at @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . at very high pressure",
    "the model must break down but this is an additional confirmation that the simple multifragmentation model in the domain @xmath57 does not contain the critical point .",
    "figure 6 gives the isothermals for @xmath50=1 , 1.4 and 1.8 at 6.5 mev temperature .",
    "drawing isothermals for fixed @xmath50 is physically relevant .",
    "we are assuming that we have a very large system with given numbers @xmath1,@xmath2 whose volume can change depending upon the physical conditions it is subjected to .",
    "if we want to study a different asymmetry we change @xmath50 accordingly and repeat the calculation . to have a complete knowledge ,",
    "calculations should be done for all relevant @xmath50 .",
    "the most asymmetric system we study is @xmath50=1.8 .",
    "of course , since we have no coulomb force the system with @xmath82 has the same thermodynamic properties as the system with @xmath83 .",
    "it is however instructive to consider isothermals of two - component systems in a more general fashion . in a one - dimensional system",
    "there is only one density and an isotherm is a line in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "now we have two densities @xmath84 and @xmath85 and isothermals become surfaces .",
    "let @xmath85 be the x - axis , @xmath84 the y - axis and @xmath56 the z - axis , the equation of state at a given temperature is a surface in this space .",
    "a projection of this surface in two dimensions can be made but for a quantitative study it is more convenient to present contours of constant @xmath56 in @xmath86 plane .",
    "such a plot is shown in fig.8 .",
    "we consider pressure contours in the region bounded by @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the reasons for choosing these boundaries were explained before .",
    "roughly speaking , the contours are either largely radial or circular .",
    "let us first consider an uninteresting gas .",
    "we assume it consists of only neutrons and protons and unlike in the present problem does not form composites .",
    "in such a case constant pressure curves would be @xmath89=constant and these would be straight lines making angle of @xmath90 with the x and y axes .",
    "instead we see at low @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( when one has a gas phase only ) not straight lines but more like concentric circles .",
    "this is because pressure is directly proportional to multiplicity ( section iii ) and multiplicity is a function of asymmetry . in our case , composites are present in the gas phase and the number of composites depend upon the asymmetry of the system .",
    "this causes constant pressure contours in the gas phase to bend from straight lines .",
    "we skip the details why the lines become like circles .",
    "we now try to explain other pressure contours which are largely radial . for this , refer back to fig.6 .",
    "we have mentioned before that in the limit @xmath91 the @xmath52 curves would have zero slopes to the right of points a , b and c on the isothermals .",
    "in such a case constant pressure contour would move exactly radially inwards from the boundary @xmath55 , would later leave the radial pattern , bend and finish at the boundary @xmath92 or @xmath93 whichever is appropriate .",
    "similar behaviour is seen in fig.8 .",
    "thus radial pressure contours reflect regions of co - existence .    as another example",
    "we show in fig.9 the pressure contours at @xmath60=7.5 mev . except near the edges of the boundaries ,",
    "pure gas phase is seen .",
    "we illustrate isospin fractionation in multifragmentation model through an example .",
    "consider multifragmentation of a neutron rich system : @xmath50=1.4 and temperature @xmath60=6.5 mev . at low density",
    "the system is in pure gas phase .",
    "following section iv , the gas phase consists of light particles with @xmath94 and the liquid phase consists of particles with @xmath35 between @xmath43 - 70 and @xmath43 . at higher density ,",
    "both gas and liquid phases are seen ( figs . 2 and 3 ) . in the present example with @xmath50=1.4 , we expect that during co - existence the neutron to proton ratio in the gas phase will rise above 1.4 and the neutron to proton ratio in the liquid phase will fall below 1.4 .",
    "the reason for this is the symmetry energy which preferentially favours formation of larger clusters closest to maximum stability ( i.e.,@xmath95 ) .",
    "this rise of neutron to proton ratio in the gas phase is illustrated in fig.10 .",
    "co - existence sets in a little beyond @xmath8=0.1 . till that point",
    "is reached the neutron to proton ratio in the gas phase is at 1.4 , the ratio of the parent system .",
    "then as the density increases the ratio increases .",
    "fig.10 also shows that even at very low density the ratio of unbound single neutrons to unbound single protons rises very rapidly .",
    "but this has got nothing to do with what is called isospin fractionation .",
    "in fact nothing special happens to this ratio when co - existence sets in .",
    "it is only if the gas phase is considered to be not just single nucleons but includes light particles as well that isospin fractionation becomes an order parameter if @xmath96 1 .    in the present example , at @xmath97 the neutron to proton ratio in the gas phase is 1.485 . in the liquid phase it is 1.375 .",
    "isospin fractionation in mean - field theories is treated in @xcite .",
    "calculations in the lattice gas model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the multifragmentation model , so useful for fitting experimental data in intermediate energy collisions , leads naturally to a model of phase transition for nuclear matter . in a range of temperature and density",
    "first order phase transition occurs .",
    "the gas phase and the liquid phase can be clearly identified .",
    "this is really remarkable .",
    "the model of nuclear multifragmentation may be unique in this respect .",
    "the gas phase consists of light nuclei with @xmath35 up to about 70 . besides these gas particles , there are large blobs of matter ( liquid ) with mass numbers close to @xmath43 with @xmath91 .",
    "the model is appropriate at subnormal nuclear density .",
    "modifications of the simple model are needed to extend the model to higher density but this may not be easy .",
    "actual nuclear systems as created in heavy ion collisions are finite and in addition have coulomb forces .",
    "this makes identification of signals which are finger prints of phase transition difficult .",
