    "with the downscaling of nanoscale electronic devices , the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method has become the most effective and accurate modeling approach in predicting the electronic transport performance .",
    "the self - consistent solution of negf and poisson s equations is capable of accurately modeling coherent as well as decoherent transport by integrating atomic / molecular orbital level physics @xcite .",
    "an aspect of negf , that currently prevents a broader use , is the large computational cost associated with the method .",
    "researchers and analysts have used several approximations to alleviate this cost .",
    "examples include the mode - space approximation @xcite , which couples 1d negf transport simulation to transverse states from solving 2d schrdinger equation on the cross - section , and the restriction to levels of lower accuracy ( such as tight - binding or effective mass levels ) .",
    "although these approximations of negf have successfully predicted the transport characteristics of nanoscale devices @xcite , these alternatives remain unable to capture atomic - scale inhomogeneities , such as surface roughness , unintentional doping , and trapped charges ( see , for example , @xcite for an illustration of the resulting inaccuracy ) .",
    "the modeling of such inhomogeneities requires a full 3d real - space negf simulation .",
    "recent studies @xcite have performed 3d negf simulations to handle these inhomogeneities but with `` coarse discretization '' ( _ i.e. _ small number of atomic orbitals or small number of grid points ) to control the computational cost . to enhance the predictability of these 3d negf simulations , finer discretizations have to be considered .",
    "therefore the computational cost of negf needs to be addressed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a numerical method that significantly reduces the cost of 3d negf simulations .    during a negf simulation ,",
    "the main computational bottleneck is the repeated evaluations of the retarded green s function , @xmath3 , and the lesser green s function , @xmath4 , over a wide range of energy values @xcite .",
    "physical quantities , such as density of states , carrier density , and transmission coefficients , are obtained from the evaluations of these green s functions .",
    "after discretization of the nanoscale device , these repeated evaluations amount to computing entries in the matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 that approximate , respectively , the retarded and lesser green s functions . recall that the matrix @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the system hamiltonian matrix and @xmath10 is the identity matrix .",
    "the self - energy matrix @xmath11 consists of two parts : the contact self - energy @xmath12 and a self - energy to represent scattering mechanisms @xmath13 .",
    "the matrix @xmath6 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 corresponds to the lesser self - energy matrix @xcite . to compute diagonal and desired off - diagonal entries of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the recursive green s function algorithm ( rgf )",
    "@xcite has been the algorithm of choice for many years .",
    "recently , the hierarchical schur complement ( hsc ) method @xcite and the fast inverse using nested dissection ( find ) method @xcite have exhibited significant speed - ups over rgf to evaluate the diagonal entries of @xmath7 . both of these methods have a smaller operation count than the rgf method . our hsc - extension to compute diagonal and desired off - diagonal entries of @xmath6 @xcite",
    "has also demonstrated significant speed - ups over rgf simulations for 2d nanoscale devices . in this paper",
    ", the efficiency of the hsc - extension @xcite over the rgf method is studied for 3d nanoscale devices .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : algorithm ] gives a brief description of the rgf and hsc - extension approaches and discusses the asymptotic operation counts for both approaches when simulating 3d devices .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the runtime analysis for a cuboid structure with a regular mesh and three state - of - the - art nanoscale devices : a graphene - boron nitride device with a multilayer hexagonal mesh ; a silicon nanowire structure with 10 localized atomic orbitals ; and a dna molecule sequence with an unstructured atomic connectivity .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] provides a brief summary of the numerical experiments .",
    "this section briefly describes the rgf method @xcite and the hsc - extension approach @xcite",
    ". then the operation counts for both methods are discussed when simulating cuboid or brick - like nanoscale devices .",
    "the rgf algorithm @xcite evaluates the specific entries of the matrices @xmath7 and @xmath6 when the system matrix @xmath16 is structured as a block - tridiagonal matrix .",
    "the off - diagonal and diagonal blocks of @xmath16 are uniquely associated with layers ( of atoms or of grid points ) orthogonal to the transport direction , usually the @xmath17-direction .",
    "the rgf algorithm is composed of two passes to compute diagonal entries of @xmath7 and two passes to compute diagonal and desired off - diagonal entries of @xmath6 .",
    "the two passes to compute entries of @xmath7 ( or of @xmath6 ) are interpreted as follows :    * the first pass marches one layer at a time from _ left to right _ along the @xmath17-direction and ,",
    "recursively , _ folds _ the effect of left layers into the current layer ; * the second pass marches one layer at a time from _ right to left _ along the @xmath17-direction and , recursively , _ extracts _ the diagonal blocks and the nearest neighbor off - diagonal blocks for the final result .",
    "mathematically , when computing diagonal entries of @xmath7 , the first pass amounts to transforming @xmath16 into a block diagonal matrix @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a lower block - triangular matrix with identity blocks on the diagonal . recall that @xmath16 being a complex symmetric matrix , the block @xmath21-factorization is a particular form of a block lu - factorization .",

    "the first step of the hsc method and of its extension gathers the grid points ( or atoms ) into arbitrarily - shaped clusters .",
