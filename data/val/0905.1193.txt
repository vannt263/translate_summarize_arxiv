    "the bright ( @xmath4 ) b2 iv star was recognized as a pulsating variable of the @xmath0  cep class more than 50 years ago @xcite , and it was believed to be singly periodic until recently .",
    "@xcite studied the star spectroscopically and demonstrated its multiperiodicity .",
    "these authors also examined the claim that @xmath1  peg is a spectroscopic binary and deduced an eccentric ( @xmath5 ) 370.5-day orbit .",
    "this orbital solution was disputed by @xcite who suggested that the orbital eccentricity was spurious and caused by outbursts similar to those of be stars , and favored an orbital period near 6.8  d , in accordance with the original suggestion by @xcite .",
    "the multiperiodic oscillations of are highly interesting because they are caused by two different sets of pulsation modes : two frequencies detected by @xcite correspond to low - order pressure ( p ) and gravity ( g ) modes typical for @xmath0  cep stars , but the other two are high - order g  modes as excited in the slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars .",
    "indeed , is located in the overlap region of both types of variables in the hr diagram ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the frequencies of the two sets of modes are sensitive to the physical conditions in different parts of the stellar interior .",
    "hybrid oscillators therefore offer the possibility to obtain a more complete picture of the physics inside a star using asteroseismology where pulsations act as seismic waves ( see , e.g. , @xcite for case studies )",
    ".    however , the possible binarity of imposes difficulties .",
    "the detection of low - frequency oscillations can be compromised by an inaccurate orbital solution .",
    "photometry does not suffer from this problem ( provided the light - time effect is negligible ) .",
    "consequently , @xcite carried out a multicolor time - series photometric study of , detected four spb - type pulsation modes , and confirmed the two modes of @xmath0  cep type .",
    "one of the latter was identified as radial ; it would be either the fundamental mode or the first overtone , immediately constraining the mean stellar density .",
    "the enormous asteroseismic promise of motivated us to perform a high - precision photometric and radial velocity study of its pulsations , in the hope to detect a sufficient number of p and g modes to sound its interior structure .",
    "was observed with the most satellite @xcite from sep 16 to oct 16 , 2008 . due to the brightness of the target , fabry imaging mode was used , and the data reduction method developed by @xcite to minimize the effects of stray light was employed .",
    "there were over 55000 data points at a cadence of 30  s in the original data set .",
    "these were summed into 4018 0.005-d bins having an rms scatter of 1  mmag per point and an effective nyquist frequency of @xmath692 .",
    "a simultaneous ground - based spectroscopic multisite campaign was organized for pulsational mode identification .",
    "the majority of the data originated from the automatic spectroscopic telescope of tennessee state university ( tsu - ast , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and consisted of 1660 spectra ( 49007100  ) taken over a span of ten weeks ( sep 3 - nov 15 , 2008 ) with an effective nyquist frequency of @xmath668 .",
    "we have reduced these spectra and extracted radial velocities from 34 lines with the techniques described by @xcite .",
    "the external error of these radial velocities is about 0.2 .",
    "this high precision results from @xmath1  peg having a very sharp lined spectrum for a hot star ; @xcite listed @xmath7 ! concerning the star s metallicity , @xcite derived @xmath8 from optical and @xcite determined @xmath9=-0.04\\pm0.08 $ ] from ultraviolet spectra .",
    "additional spectroscopy was carried out at three observatories , and ground - based time - resolved multicolor photometry was acquired at three more sites",
    ". however , the present paper only reports the initial results from the most space photometry and tsu - ast radial velocities .",
    "the heliocentrically corrected data were searched for periodicities using the program period04 @xcite .",
    "amplitude spectra were computed , compared with the spectral window functions , and the frequencies of the intrinsic and statistically significant peaks in the fourier spectra were determined .",
    "multifrequency fits with all detected signals were calculated step by step , the corresponding frequencies , amplitudes and phases were optimized and subtracted from the data before computing residual amplitude spectra , which were then examined in the same way .",
    "this analysis was performed for the most and radial velocity data independently .",
    "we conservatively only accepted signals that exceeded an amplitude signal - to - noise ratio of five in at least one of the data sets and that were prominent in the other .",
    "some steps of this procedure are shown in fig .",
    "fourteen independent signals were detected ; the agreement between the photometric and radial velocity measurements is remarkable . the residual amplitude spectrum after this solution was featureless for the radial velocities . some peaks in the residual most data remained , but to err on the side of caution we did not consider them to be intrinsic to @xmath1  peg .",
    "the frequencies of all these signals are consistent within the errors between the two data sets .",
    "we have determined weighted mean values of those frequencies by computing the formal uncertainties @xcite in the individual data sets and then applying their inverse squared as the weight . with the resulting frequencies fixed , we have re - calculated the amplitudes , phases and amplitude signal - to - noise ratios and list the results in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "all but the two closest frequencies are resolved within our data set .",
    "their difference @xmath10  is 82% of the time resolution of the radial velocity data .",
    "since a significant peak remains after prewhitening @xmath11 we accept @xmath12 , but caution that the parameters of these two variations in table  [ tbl-1 ] may have systematic errors .",
    "we start by examining previous claims that @xmath1  peg is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "our radial velocities were acquired in a period of time where the orbital solution by @xcite predicts a change in radial velocity of about 20 .",
    "our nightly mean radial velocities are constant within @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite claimed an orbit with a 6.816d period and about 0.8radial velocity amplitude .",
    "again , this is inconsistent with our data .",
    "instead , the 1alias of this `` orbital '' period lies well within the domain of the g - mode frequencies ( @xmath14d=0.8533 ) ; the strongest g - mode pulsations have radial velocity amplitudes of 0.7 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath1  peg is not a 6.8-d spectroscopic binary .",
    "the cause of the sporadic radial velocity changes remains to be understood .",
    "the possibility of be - star outbursts @xcite seems remote given that @xmath1  peg likely rotates intrinsically slowly , unlike the be stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    according to the position of @xmath1  peg in the hr diagram determined by @xcite , all signals with frequencies below 1are due to high - order g  modes ;",
    "the remaining variations are caused by low - order p and mixed modes .",
    "@xcite identified @xmath15 as a radial mode and argued that @xmath11 is a dipole mode ; these are the only two modes with reasonably secure identifications . from comparison with pulsation models this author concluded that models in just two small domains of parameter space in the hr diagram are consistent with these mode identifications and with the frequency values . in case @xmath15",
    "is the radial fundamental mode , models around 8.5  m@xmath16 match the observations . if @xmath15 corresponded to the first radial overtone",
    ", models with masses around 9.6  m@xmath16 reproduce @xmath15 and @xmath11 .",
    "all models in the present paper and by @xcite were computed with the the warsaw - new jersey stellar evolution and pulsation code ( e.g. , see @xcite for a description ) , using op opacities , the @xcite element mixture , and providing linear nonadiabatic model frequencies .",
    "no rotation or convective core overshooting was included in the models for simplicity of this preliminary model fitting .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] compares the additional @xmath2 @xmath0  cep - type pulsation frequencies predicted by the two models with our new observations .",
    "all newly detected pulsation frequencies are explained by the 8.5 m@xmath16 model ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . at first sight ,",
    "there are two small inconsistencies : the close doublet @xmath17 only has one theoretical counterpart , and @xmath18 is not well matched by the theoretical value .",
    "the doublet can be explained by possible rotational splitting at @xmath19 , consistent with the very low @xmath20 of the star .",
    "the mismatch for @xmath18 may be more of a problem , but it would not be new : in their analysis of the pulsation spectrum of , @xcite noted the same problem for the highest - frequency p  mode ( @xmath21 , p@xmath22 ) observed .",
    "interestingly , in the present model @xmath18 would also correspond to the @xmath21 , p@xmath22 mode and even the size of the frequency mismatch is similar .",
    "it can be suspected that this mismatch originates from inadequate physics in the models that can be improved through asteroseismology .    the 9.6 m@xmath16 model ( lower panel of fig . [ fig2 ] )",
    "results in poorer agreement between the observed and theoretical frequencies , although the number of theoretically predicted modes in the domain of excited frequencies is larger .",
    "in particular , only one theoretical @xmath21 mode is available to match @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "one would need to invoke rather fast rotation to explain both modes , but in this case @xmath1  peg would be viewed close to pole - on , which would cause heavy geometrical cancellation of just these pulsations .",
    "we conclude that , in all likelihood , @xmath1  peg is a @xmath6 8.5 m@xmath16 star oscillating with a dominant radial fundamental mode . in this case , all the theoretically predicted @xmath25 @xmath0  cep - type pulsation modes are observed .",
    "the amplitudes and phases of the oscillations can be used to type the pulsation modes .",
    "we have computed theoretical radial velocity to light amplitude ratios and phase differences with for the _ most _ bandpass .",
    "the 8.5 m@xmath16 model was used together with static atmospheres @xcite with a metallicity parameter @xmath9=0.0 $ ] and a microturbulence velocity @xmath26 km / s .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical and observed amplitude ratios and phase shifts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ; modes with @xmath27 were considered .",
    "the measured amplitude ratios and phase shifts are consistent with the interpretation that all oscillation frequencies are caused by modes with @xmath28 ; theoretical results for modes with higher @xmath29 are off scale in fig .",
    "this corroborates the identification obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "together with our ground - based multicolor photometry , our radial velocities can be used to constrain nonadiabatic pulsation theory , as empirical determinations of the @xmath30 parameter used to describe the bolometric flux amplitude depending on the surface displacement can be made . in turn , this can be used to choose the most suitable opacities for model calculations @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows a comparison of theoretically predicted g - mode frequencies of our 8.5  m@xmath16 model with the observations .",
    "the frequency separations of the g  modes are well explained by this model : five of the six observed modes may form a sequence of consecutive radial overtones of @xmath21 modes .",
    "the sixth mode would then be @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath21 modes are stable ; a final seismic model must explain their excitation .",
    "we conclude that @xmath1  peg presents sufficient information to carry out detailed seismic modeling of a hybrid pulsator for the first time .",
    "the eight @xmath0  cephei pulsation frequencies restrict the possible models and their parameters considerably .",
    "the observed amplitude ratios and phase shifts between the radial velocities and photometric data provide clues towards the opacities to be used .",
    "theoretical models constrained by such a large set of observables must also reproduce the high - order g  modes and the excited frequency domains .",
    "the present study is a demonstration of the value of combining space photometry with ground - based spectroscopy of bright stars .",
