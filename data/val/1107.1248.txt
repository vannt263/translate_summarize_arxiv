    "this article is dedicated to the construction and the fundamental properties of a model of dissipative transport , describing the electron or hole transport in semiconductors at very low temperature . by `` very low ''",
    "it is meant that the temperature is low enough so as to confine the charge carriers to the impurity band . without dissipation ,",
    "the transport is _ coherent _ and is likely to be described by an anderson model , namely a schrdinger operator on a discrete lattice with a random potential . in _",
    "lightly doped _",
    "semiconductors this model has to be considered in the _ strong localization regime _ as will be explained in section  [ mott09.sec-phys ] .",
    "the main source of dissipation in all solids , including semiconductors , is coming from the _ electron - phonon _ interaction .",
    "namely , the coulomb interaction between electrons and nuclei leads to the slow nuclei motion when an electron is passing by .",
    "the harmonic interaction between nuclei leads , in turn , to the production of acoustic waves , that are quantized , at least if produced in small quantities . these quanta of acoustic waves are called _",
    "phonons_. these waves propagate in the crystal at the speed of sound and can kick another electron eventually , leading to loss of information about the electron quantum state .",
    "there are other sources of dissipation for the electron motion like the direct coulomb interaction between them , spin coupling or photon emission .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the first process is quantitatively more important than all others .",
    "still , even the dominant mechanism for dissipation can be considered as weak in most cases , in particular for the problem considered in the present paper .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to approximate the system by using the so - called _",
    "markov approximation_. as a consequence , the dissipative dynamic can be described through a markov semigroup whose generator is a lindblad operator @xcite , also called nowadays",
    "_ lindbladian_. like in atomic physics @xcite , this lindbladian could be computed from their second order perturbation theory , called the _ fermi golden rule_. it will not be the method used here .",
    "the purpose of the present work will be to construct a lindblad operator that describes phenomenologically the dominant sources of dissipation , and to investigate its spectral properties .",
    "the precise description of the model is given in subsection  [ mott09.ssect-model ] .",
    "the spectral properties are summarized in section  [ mott09.sect-model ] .",
    "the main result is the theorem  [ mott09.th-spectdiss ] , showing that ( i ) such an operator and the dynamical semigroup it generates are well defined even if the system is out of equilibrium and that ( ii ) it forces the return to equilibrium if there is no gradient of chemical potential or of temperature in the system .",
    "however , the main new contribution of the present work lies in the mathematical framework as explained below .",
    "but since the explicit model is strongly dependent of the physical regime that it intends to describe , it will be necessary to describe the physics in detail in order to make sure that the model is realistic ( see section  [ mott09.sec-phys ] ) .",
    "the problem investigated here is motivated by the mechanism called _ variable range hopping conductivity _",
    "it has dominated the study of semiconductors for almost two decades since the work of miller and abrahams in 1960 @xcite and the seminal contribution of mott @xcite predicting the behavior of the conductivity as a function of the temperature .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that this regime is also the dominant contribution in the quantum hall effect @xcite that explains in particular the amazing accuracy of the experiment . for indeed",
    ", the relative error with which the hall conductivity can be measured in a qhe experiment is of the order of @xmath0 due to the smallness of the direct conductivity on the plateau of conductivity @xcite .",
    "the theory of the integer qhe has been made rigorous through the use of the formalism of non - commutative geometry in @xcite . in this latter work",
    ", the problem of dissipative transport was investigated within the so - called _ relaxation time approximation _ ( rta ) .",
    "the rta reduces the dissipative mechanism to only one time scale and allows to consider the charge carriers as independent particles .",
    "as shown in @xcite , when applied to the qhe , this approximation leads to a relative error of @xmath1 with the best data , namely six orders of magnitude larger than what is actually observed  ! !",
    "the reason is that the charge carriers conductivity is suppressed by the variable range hopping , as was shown by mott @xcite .",
    "however , such a mechanism involves an infinite number of time scales .",
    "it was advocated in @xcite that such a mechanism can be represented through a markov semigroup , the generator of which is a lindblad operator .",
    "unfortunately previous attempts to implement this idea have provided mixed results .",
    "the main reason is that the charge carriers , electrons or holes , are fermions and any approximation leading to consider these particles in a semi classical regime fails to include the statistical correlation induced by the electron - phonon interactions . in order to successfully represent this mechanism ,",
    "a mathematical model must take second quantization into account .",
    "the main new contribution of the present paper is precisely to work with a many - body formalism .",
    "since this approach is technically very demanding , the model will be simplified .",
    "the main simplification consists in replacing the anderson model , describing the coherent part of the motion , by a purely potential contribution , neglecting the kinetic part , which , in real semiconductors is indeed extremely small .",
    "this kinetic part will be reintroduced in the dissipative mechanism through a contribution of the tunneling effect between impurities .",
    "even with so many simplifications , the formalism is heavy and will occupy most of this paper .",
    "this is because the random character of the distribution of impurities breaks the translation invariance .",
    "since the early eighties , thanks to using the ideas of non - commutative geometry @xcite , the formalism required to replace the translation group is known ( for instance , see @xcite and references therein ) : a groupoid replaces the group of translations .",
    "the inclusion of the many - body formalism in this framework was developed in the phd thesis of dominique spehner @xcite .",
    "this leads to replace the observable algebra by a _ continuous field _ of @xmath2-algebras over the space describing the disorder .",
    "the notion of continuous field of banach spaces was introduced by tomyama @xcite in the context of the spectral theory for @xmath2-algebras and later developed by dixmier @xcite . while the concept is easy to understand",
    ", it is technically demanding .",
    "then , the coherent dynamics can be defined as a continuous field of dynamics , leading to a continuous field of kms - states describing the equilibrium of the electron gas in the solid . in much the same way",
    ", the dissipative dynamics is defined by a continuous field of markov semigroups . in the present work , various existence results for the dynamics are proposed .",
    "one , mainly the theorem  [ mott09.th-convag ] , is based on the estimates used by bratteli and robinson @xcite to prove the existence of the dynamics in the many - body theory .",
    "the other one , mainly the theorem  [ mott09.th-close ] , uses the continuous field of hilbert spaces generated by the field of kms - states , through the gns - construction , and sees the lindbladian as a non - commutative analog of a _",
    "dirichlet form_. dirichlet forms were introduced by beurling and deny @xcite and the characterization was completed by fukushima @xcite .",
    "the noncommutative dirichlet forms were defined by albeverio and hoegh - krhn @xcite and they were characterized in full generality by cipriani @xcite .",
    "the definition requires some notion of positivity in the hilbert space of the gns - representation .",
    "such a positivity is provided by a cone in the hilbert space , that was identified and characterized in the early seventies by araki @xcite and connes @xcite . in each fiber of the field of hilbert spaces , it is the cone generated by positive elements of the corresponding fiber of the field of observable algebras .",
    "for the sake of the reader , this will be explained in section  [ mott09.ssect-gns ] .",
    "because the formalism required here is so heavy , it seems wiser to restrict the present paper to the description of the dynamics and the return to equilibrium .",
    "however , the real goal is to show that this model is liable to account for the mott prediction concerning the low temperature behavior of the conductivity .",
    "an important result was obtained by @xcite : by looking at the variable range hopping at very large length scale , as a random walk in a random environment the authors could prove that the mott prediction was a lower bound to the diffusion constant .",
    "however , to get an upper bound is highly non trivial . in order to do so , using the present model , it will be necessary to face two challenges .",
    "the first one is the definition of the local currents .",
    "as it turns out , this is not a trivial problem because of possible divergent effects in the infinite volume limit .",
    "it requires insight about the physical nature of currents and of the dissipation mechanisms . with the proper concept , though it is possible to prove rigorously the validity of the kubo formula @xcite whenever the charge carriers can be considered as a continuous fluid .",
    "the other challenge is the discontinuous nature of the variable range hopping mechanism , forcing the charge carriers to hop at distances ten times larger than the average distance between impurities . in particular ,",
    "the _ continuous fluid picture breaks down _  !",
    "this is why miller and abrahams @xcite proposed to see the charge carriers as electric currents in a random network . in the early seventies percolation theory",
    "was successfully introduced into this picture @xcite to justify the prediction of mott . however",
    ", several approximations , justified by the physical situation , require additional work in order to make this argument rigorous within the scope of the present model .",
    "it will be hopefully the subject of a forthcoming publication .    *",

    "part of this work was done in bielefeld with the support of the sfb 701 `` spectral structures and topological methods in mathematics '' during the summers 2009 and 2010 .",
    "thanks the school of mathematics at the georgia institute of technology for support during the spring 2009 .",
    "the content of this section can be found in several textbook , in particular the one by shklovskii and efros @xcite .",
    "the two types of semi - conductors that are the most used and studied today are _ silicon _ and @xmath3 , due to their importance in modern electronics , telecommunication and computer hardware .",
    "silicon is currently obtained , in the industrial process , in a form of cylindrical ingots of about @xmath4 in length and @xmath5 in diameter .",
    "the crystal is perfect with less than @xmath0 impurity or defect per atom .",
    "because silicon has @xmath6 valence electrons , the atomic orbitals hybridate in the @xmath7 form , leading to a diamond crystal , where tetrahedra alternating in a staggered way .",
    "@xmath8 belongs to the column iii of the periodic table , namely it has @xmath9 valence electrons .",
    "@xmath10 has @xmath11 valence electrons and thus , it belongs to the column v. mixed together in equal quantity , @xmath8 and @xmath10 exchange one electron to produce pairs of tetrahedra , leading also to a diamond lattice .",
    "if the electron - electron interactions are ignored , the band spectrum is similar to the one of graphene , namely two bands touch on a conical point exactly at the fermi level , ( the fermi level is the maximum energy of an electron at zero temperature ) .",
    "however , the coulomb interaction between the valence electrons belonging to the same atom , is strong enough to force the opening of a gap at the fermi level , which will be called the _ main gap_. for @xmath12 , this gap is about @xmath13 , which is enormous .",
    "correspondingly , the temperature necessary to allow a large number of electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction band would be @xmath14 . in other words , the clean silicon is a perfect insulator . for @xmath3",
    "the gap is @xmath15 corresponding to a temperature of @xmath16 .    for the purpose of electronic applications ,",
    "the doping is about @xmath17 impurity per atomic site .",
    "such a crystal is called _",
    "lightly doped_. for @xmath18-type doping , the impurities are atoms with one more electron in the valence band than the crystal atoms ( such as @xmath19 ) .",
    "then , an impurity band is created in the gap at a distance of about @xmath20 from the conduction band ( see fig .  [ mott09.fig-band ] ) .",
    "hence , the gap between the impurity band and the conduction band is @xmath21 times smaller than the main gap . in particular , at room temperature , most electrons of the impurity band jump into the conduction band , which explains why semi - conductors are actually conductors .",
    "however , the conduction electron density is controlled by the impurity concentration , namely it is much smaller than in metals . at very low temperatures ,",
    "say around @xmath22 , this gap is too large to allow electrons to jump , so that electrons are confined in the impurity band ( see fig .",
    "[ mott09.fig-band ] ) .",
    "similarly , for a @xmath23-type doping , the impurities are acceptors instead , namely they have one electron less on their valence band than the crystal atoms ( such as @xmath24 ) .",
    "then , a hole - impurity band is created near the valence band at approximately the same distance as before .",
    "similar conclusions arise after proceeding to the _ hole - particle symmetry _ : ( i ) the charge carriers are holes instead of electrons , ( ii ) the origin of the energy is the top of the valence band instead of the bottom of the conduction band and ( iii ) the sign of energy is reversed .    for an impurity concentration @xmath25 per atom ,",
    "the average distance between impurities is given by @xmath26 atomic spacings .",
    "as will be seen in the next section  [ mott09.ssect-hyd ] , an isolated impurity behaves like an hydrogen atom with a re - normalized mass and a re - normalized coulomb coupling constant . in these materials ,",
    "the bohr radius of an impurity is @xmath27 .",
    "hence the average distance between impurities corresponds approximately to @xmath28 .",
    "this gives a band width of approximately @xmath29 , @xmath30 times smaller than the gap between the impurity band and the conduction ( or valence ) band ( see fig .",
    "[ mott09.fig-band ] ) .    in most cases",
    "a semi - conductor has the two types of impurities simultaneously .",
    "in such a case it is called _ compensate_. if @xmath18-type impurities dominate , then all acceptors will get an extra electron since their energy is lower , creating negative ions , and some proportion of the donors will become ionized creating positive charges in the crystal .",
    "the fermi level , namely the maximum energy of an electron at zero temperature , will be located within the donor impurity band at a position depending upon the relative concentration of donor and acceptor .",
    "if the acceptors dominate , some of them will acquire all the electrons coming form the donors and will become negatively charged , while all the donors will be ionized",
    ". the fermi level will then be inside the acceptor impurity band and the conduction will be due to holes instead . in both cases however , the positions of the ions are random , creating a random coulomb field within the crystal which influence the energy level of the impurity electrons .",
    "if one donor impurity is inserted in a perfectly periodic crystal , slater @xcite showed in 1949 using a theorem by wannier @xcite , that the extra electron behaves like in an hydrogen atom , with re - normalized parameters for its mass and the dielectric constant , provided the origin of energies is taken at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "if the impurity is an acceptor instead , a similar argument can be used for holes instead of electrons , using electron - hole symmetry .",
    "if the bottom of the conduction band is an isotropic minimum , the corresponding effective hamiltonian describing the electron near the impurity is given by @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the electron charge , @xmath33 is the effective mass of the electron in the crystal and @xmath34 is the re - normalized coulomb constant in the medium .",
    "the ground state is given by    @xmath35    so that @xmath36 , called the _",
    "bohr radius _ , gives the length scale beyond which the wave function becomes negligible .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath37 given in eq .",
    "( [ mott09.eq-1h ] ) .",
    "the other energy levels are given by @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "in particular the gap between the ground - state and the first excited state is @xmath40 ( see fig .  [ mott09.fig-band ] ) .    as a result",
    ", in the donor case , the lower energy state of the impurity is located in the gap of the crystal , at a distance @xmath41 from the conduction band .",
    "applied to impurities in a crystal , the wannier equivalence theorem provides effective values for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are usually different from the values for the electron in the vacuum . for silicon , this bohr radius is about @xmath21 and @xmath42 @xcite .      in a semi - conductor , there is a density of impurities . even if this density is as small as @xmath17 , as it is for lightly doped media ,",
    "the effect on the charge carrier dynamics is not negligible .",
    "the first important effect occurs if the semi - conductor is compensated . for indeed",
    "since the density of donors and acceptors are not equal , there is a nonzero density of ions in the crystal .",
    "the position of these ions is random .",
    "consequently , they create a static electric field within the crystal , which is also random .",
    "since the charge carriers are confined on the impurity site , they can not move to screen this field .",
    "as a consequence , the effective potential seen by each charge carrier at an impurity site , is itself shifted by a random term . since the distance between ions is very large , the values of potential at each impurity site might be considered as independent random variables . by homogeneity",
    ", they should have the same distribution .    on the other hand ,",
    "since the ground state wave function decays exponentially fast , the tunneling of a charge carrier between two impurity sites is controlled by the overlap of the two wave packets localized on each of the impurities .",
    "this overlap is of the order of @xmath43 if @xmath44 is the distance between the two impurities .",
    "if the average distance between impurities is about @xmath45 , this term is very small ( of the order of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this implies that the effective hamiltonian describing the motion of a charge carrier through the impurity sites is made of two contributions : ( i ) the contribution of the random potential created by the ions in the crystal and ( ii ) the hopping term of the order of @xmath43 .",
    "since this latter contribution is much smaller than the potential contribution , this effective hamiltonian is given by an anderson model in which the kinetic term is much smaller than the potential term .",
    "hence , _ paradoxically , lightly doped semi - conductors , at very low temperature , correspond to a strong disordered anderson model_. in the present paper , the hopping term will be ignored , so that the one - particle hamiltonian will be a pure on - site potential .      in 1968 , mott @xcite proposed the following argument liable to explain the conductivity properties of anderson insulators at low temperature ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "mott assumes that the solid is a @xmath46-dimensional anderson insulator , namely the electrons are strongly localized . in particular , each energy level of the electron energy spectrum is associated with a position in the solid within a ball of diameter given by the localization length @xmath47 ( which can be taken of the order of @xmath36 ) .",
    "moreover , he assumes that the density of states ( dos ) @xmath48 at the fermi level is non vanishing but small enough so as to avoid overlap between electron states . in particular the mean distance between neighboring electron states",
    "is large compared to @xmath47 .",
    "the inverse of @xmath49 is a measure of the mean level spacing between states within a ball of diameter @xmath47 .",
    "the temperature will be small compared with this scale , namely @xmath50 if @xmath51 denotes the boltzmann constant .",
    "then within a small error , all states with energy smaller than the fermi level @xmath52 are occupied , whereas the ones with higher energy are empty .",
    "the probability that a phonon of energy @xmath53 is produced is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "this is true provided @xmath55 .",
    "such a phonon can be absorbed by an electron of the fermi sea localized at @xmath56 , with energy @xmath57 , and cause this electron to hop into a state localized at @xmath58 with energy @xmath59 .",
    "the probability for such an event to happen is controlled by the tunneling effect forcing the electron to move from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the distance between such states , so that the tunneling probability be proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath64 of transfer of an electron at distance @xmath44 from its original location is proportional to @xmath65\\ ] ] by definition of the dos , the product @xmath66 represents the average number of states in an energy interval of width @xmath53 localized in a cube of size @xmath44 .",
    "mott then argued that the most likely value of the radius satisfies @xmath67 the probability of jump @xmath64 is then optimized over @xmath44 and @xmath53 .",
    "this can be done by giving @xmath44 its minimum value compatible with eq .",
    "( [ mott09.eq-nfbound ] ) and by maximizing _ w.r.t .",
    "_ @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the conductivity , which is proportional to the sum of contributions of all such jumps , will be controlled by the maximal value of @xmath64 .",
    "optimizing over @xmath53 leads to @xmath68\\ , , \\qquad { k_{\\mbox{\\tiny \\it b}}}t_0 = \\frac{(d+1)^{d+1}}{d^d}\\frac{1}{n_f \\xi^d}\\,.\\ ] ] then , the phonon energy optimizing @xmath64 is given by @xmath69 , while the average distance of the jump is given by @xmath70 .    clearly , the conductivity is proportional to the probability of transfer of electrons per unit time .",
    "therefore , we expect the conductivity to be proportional to the same factor as a function of the temperature .    for lightly doped @xmath71-semiconductors like silicon ( see @xcite ) , the localization length is given by the bohr radius of the impurity , which is about @xmath21 .",
    "for a concentration of @xmath17 , the mean distance between impurities is @xmath72 which is approximately @xmath73 .",
    "then , the typical width of the impurity band is about @xmath74 . assuming the dos to be flat on it gives @xmath75 which leads to @xmath76",
    "this is huge indeed . at @xmath77 ,",
    "this gives @xmath78 , namely ( i ) the electron hops at about @xmath79 , ( ii ) the conductivity is multiplied by a factor @xmath80 due to this mechanism  !",
    "it turns out that this is exactly what happens in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite : the mott variable range hopping controls the fluctuation of the plateaus , leading to the amazing accuracy of this experiment .",
    "mott s law has been well documented in the experimental physics literature .",
    "a review of the results obtained in the seventies on various semi - conductors can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and some results have been reported in @xcite .",
    "in addition a large part of the book by efros and shklovskii @xcite is dedicated to this effect ( see chapter 9 , in particular and references therein ) .",
    "the previous version of mott s argument is based on a critical assumption summarized by eq .",
    "( [ mott09.eq-nfbound ] ) .",
    "this part of the argument has been the focus of attention of several works in the early seventies @xcite and it is the main topic of a large fraction of the book of shklovskii and efros @xcite . following the description provided by miller and abrahams @xcite ,",
    "the electron conduction is seen as a random resistor network . in the early sixties ,",
    "ziman @xcite suggested that percolation theory should be a key technique to investigate hopping transport .",
    "since then it became indeed increasingly clear that percolation gives the right argument to justify eq .",
    "( [ mott09.eq-nfbound ] ) and mott s prediction .      based upon the argument of mott , it becomes possible to propose a model .",
    "this section will be dedicated to its heuristic description , leaving the rigorous definitions for the sections that follow . all along the present paper , only @xmath18-type doped semiconductors will be considered .",
    "a particle - hole symmetry permits to consider the @xmath23-type case .",
    "let @xmath81 be the lattice @xmath82 .",
    "for any @xmath83 let @xmath84 be a random variable with @xmath85 if and only if an electron state is available at @xmath60 . given a family of random variables @xmath86 each taking values in @xmath87 ,",
    "let @xmath88 be the random subset of @xmath81 containing all sites @xmath60 where @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath88 is the set of sites in the semiconductor on which an impurity electron state is available . in the tradition of solid state physics , and only for the heuristic description of the model , the total number of sites available will be considered as finite .",
    "the electron will be described in the second quantization picture , ( see @xcite ) , through a pair of fermion creation - annihilation operators @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a lattice site , thus obeying the canonical anti - commutation rules which we abreviat by car , @xmath91 here @xmath92 denotes the adjoint of the operator @xmath93 . in this work , for simplicity ,",
    "only spineless electrons are considered , because the model proposed will not couple the spin to the motion .",
    "the quantum dynamics will be made of two parts : ( i ) the coherent part , describing the electron motion in absence of dissipation , and ( ii ) the dissipative part , taking into account the interaction with other degrees of freedom , especially the phonons .    since the dynamic concerns the electron gas , the system will be considered in the _ local equilibrium approximation _ @xcite .",
    "namely the electron gas is seen as the union of _ mesoscopic cells _ with size large enough so that within a _ mesoscopic time _",
    "each such cell has the time to return to equilibrium . on the other hand",
    "the size of the cells is small compared to the size of the sample under consideration . in each mesoscopic cell ,",
    "the electron gas is in an equilibrium state , namely defined by the usual thermodynamic parameters , the temperature @xmath94 ( or rather the inverse temperature @xmath95 ) and the chemical potential @xmath96 .",
    "such mesoscopic cells are opened , namely they allow both energy and electrons to be exchanged from cell to cell . therefore , only the average of the energy and of the particle number is fixed .",
    "in addition , if the system is put out of equilibrium , then both @xmath94 and @xmath96 may vary slowly in space and time , so that the relative variation in each mesoscopic cell is negligible .",
    "the coherent part is given by a hamiltonian and the observables evolve according to the heisenberg equation .",
    "but , because of the local equilibrium approximation and because each mesoscopic cell is opened , the hamiltonian will represent the _ free energy _ of the gas in the mesoscopic cell .",
    "therefore it has the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 represents the mechanical energy of the gas , while @xmath99 is the number of electrons ( in the mesoscopic cell ) .",
    "the mechanical part @xmath98 of this hamiltonian will be reduced to the potential energy of the electrons on the impurity sites , ignoring the hopping term between impurities , since the tunneling effect is so small for lightly doped semiconductors .",
    "the potential will be represented by a family @xmath100 of independent identically distributed random variables , where @xmath101 belongs to the impurity band @xmath102 which is a compact interval . for the sake of the present model",
    ", the distribution will be assumed to be uniform in @xmath102 and it shall be independent of the random variables @xmath103 .",
    "the family of all random variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 will be simply denoted by a random variable @xmath106 .",
    "the corresponding probability space consisting of the compact set of all such families will be denoted by @xmath107 and the corresponding probability measure on the borel sets of @xmath107 by @xmath108 .",
    "many operators such as the free energy depend on the randomness @xmath109 , e.g. the free energy becomes @xmath110 since the electron - phonon interaction is weak , the dissipative part will be given in the markov approximation , in which all degrees of freedom other than the electrons are integrated out , while the time scale for this interaction to rearrange the electron state is considered as negligible .",
    "namely , the dissipative part of the dynamics will be described by the generator of a markov semigroup , which , thanks to the theorem by lindblad @xcite is given by a lindbladian of the form @xmath111 the description of the model will precisely consist in proposing an expression for the @xmath112 s . in order to implement the mott scheme",
    ", these operators should describe the jump of an electron form an impurity site @xmath90 to an impurity site @xmath113 .",
    "the corresponding jump operator , denoted by @xmath114 , should be proportional to @xmath115 , since the later annihilates an electron at @xmath60 and creates one at @xmath61 .",
    "if one of the sites , @xmath60 or @xmath61 , is not in the random lattice @xmath88 , then there ca nt be a jump from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "hence we set @xmath114 equal to zero in this case .",
    "hence , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the probability rate at which the jump arises . following the mott argument",
    ", this jump probability rate needs to take into account the probability of a phonon being absorbed or created by the electrons .",
    "the absorption process is dominated by the probability of a phonon of energy @xmath118 to be created by the thermal bath .",
    "it is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath119 with a good approximation .",
    "but if @xmath120 it follows that @xmath121 . then the electron located at @xmath60 absorbing this energy must find an available site @xmath61 with energy @xmath122 . on the other hand ,",

    "if @xmath404 is the generator of a semigroup @xmath677 on a @xmath2-algebra @xmath185 , then an element @xmath189 is called invariant for the semigroup if @xmath93 is an eigenvector of @xmath554 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath127 for every @xmath678 .",
    "also , if @xmath286 is any state on the @xmath2-algebra @xmath185 then @xmath286 is called @xmath404-invariant if @xmath679 the following result states elementary properties of the jump operators which are defined by eq .",

    "it can be obtained by inspection and the proof will be left to the reader .              in order to justify the need for the thermal bath part of the dissipation operator ,",
    "it is enough to observe that the kinetic part @xmath142 suffers from an annoying disease : since it leaves the number operator invariant , it does not have a unique invariant state .",
    "in fact , varying the chemical potential @xmath96 in produces infinitely many invariant states .",
    "thus , the thermal bath fixes the chemical potential and the kinetic part of the dissipation operator alone can not drive the electron gas towards equilibrium .",

    "in particular its set of invariant state is not reduced to a point .",
    "* proof : * the number operator has been defined in eq .",
    "( [ mott09.eq-nbodynh ] ) for finite volume . as for the hamiltonian dynamics it generates an automorphism group which is defined , in the infinite volume limit by @xmath685 in particular , @xmath680 is invariant by this automorphism group .",
    "therefore , like in proposition  [ mott09.prop-disexists ] , it follows that @xmath686 hence any state generated by a finite volume hamiltonian of the form @xmath687 where @xmath64 and @xmath688 are polynomials , is invariant by @xmath689 .",
    "@xmath228                  [ mott09.prop-uninvst ] the operators @xmath154 and @xmath407 have a unique invariant state given by @xmath294 .",

    "let @xmath93 be a local observable first , namely @xmath518 . then , using the decomposition into monomials @xmath93 can be written as @xmath704 where @xmath705 .",

    "thus @xmath711 .",
    "using this argument inductively on every point of @xmath171 shows that @xmath93 is a multiple of @xmath418 .",
    "if now @xmath712 , then for all @xmath713 there is a finite set @xmath714 and @xmath715 such that @xmath716 . for any finite subset @xmath171 of @xmath81 let @xmath717 be the canonical projection .",
    "the commutation rule above implies that @xmath718 also commutes with all the @xmath162 for @xmath213 , showing that there is @xmath719 such that @xmath720 . for @xmath340 , @xmath721 .",
    "it follows that ( i ) @xmath722 and ( ii ) @xmath723 for @xmath724 .",

    "hence @xmath726 .",
    "this shows that @xmath727 .",
    "3)- by construction , both @xmath407 and @xmath154 leave each @xmath732 invariant .",
    "therefore @xmath733 and @xmath734 are well defined on each of the @xmath732 s and define markov semi - groups ( proposition [ mott09.prop-cplind ] ) .",
    "since the multiples of the identity are the only invariant observables of the semigroups , @xmath127 is a simple eigenvalue of these semi - groups .",
    "consequently @xmath735 and @xmath736 exist for each @xmath737 and , ( since these limits are invariant observable for the corresponding semigroups ) , these limits are multiples @xmath738 and @xmath739 respectively of the identity . since the semi - groups are contractions the result extends by continuity to all elements of @xmath242 .",
    "4)- by eq .",
    "( [ mmstar ] ) it follows that @xmath742 and @xmath743 are states on @xmath242 .",
    "if now @xmath286 is a @xmath407-invariant state and @xmath740 , then @xmath744 similarly , if @xmath286 is a @xmath745-invariant state then @xmath746 .",
    "5)- thanks to proposition  [ mott09.prop-dgsad ] , it follows that @xmath294 is both @xmath747 and @xmath404-invariant , thus @xmath748 and @xmath749 .",
    "therefore @xmath294 is the unique invariant state for @xmath407 and @xmath154 .",
    "as explained in section  [ mott09.ssect-jumpdy ] the dissipation operators , defined previously , define self - adjoint positive operators on the hilbert space of the gns representation .",
    "some spectral properties are given by the following result    [ mott09.th-spectdiss ] ( i ) if @xmath752 and @xmath628 denote the corresponding positive self - adjoint operators acting on the gns representation , then both admit @xmath753 as a simple eigenvalue and both have a positive gap separating zero from the rest of the spectrum bounded from below by @xmath754 .",
    "\\(ii ) let @xmath755 be the closed subspace of @xmath392 generated by vectors in @xmath756 which are orthogonal to @xmath757 .",
    "then both @xmath752 and @xmath628 leave @xmath755 invariant and their restriction to @xmath755 is bounded below by @xmath152 .",
    "* proof : * ( i ) in the hilbert space @xmath392 of the gns representation , monomials in the annihilation - creation operators make up a total set .",
    "this helps creating an orthonormal basis in this hilbert space .",
    "first , for @xmath56 let @xmath758 be defined by @xmath759 it is easy to check that both elements define unit vectors in @xmath392 , and that they are orthogonal to each other . for @xmath760 let @xmath761 be defined by ( omitting the reference to @xmath109 ) @xmath762 if two components of @xmath352 are equal , then @xmath763 .",
    "thus the @xmath352 s will be restricted to the set of elements in @xmath764 made of distinct points . if the order in presenting the points of @xmath352 is changed , then @xmath765 changes sign according to the signature of the permutation .",
    "hence , modulo a sign , @xmath765 depends only upon the set @xmath766 . in much the same way the vectors @xmath767 will be defined as follows        [ mott09.lem-gnsortho ] the vectors in @xmath392 given by @xmath769 , where @xmath770 vary among the set of triplets of three disjoint finite subsets of @xmath771 , including the empty set , make up an orthonormal basis of @xmath392 .    *",
    "proof : * first , these elements define all possible monomials in @xmath242 up to a scalar multiplication .",
    "consequently they generate a dense subspace .",
    "if it is proved that these vectors make up an orthonormal family , then they make up a hilbert basis .",
    "second , due to the factorization property of the equilibrium state @xmath294 and since @xmath770 are disjoint , it follows that @xmath772 again the factorization property of @xmath294 and the commutation rules gives @xmath773 a similar result applies for @xmath774 .",
    "it also applies to @xmath775 once it is remarked that @xmath776 .",
    "hence each of these vectors is normalized .",
    "let now @xmath777 be three disjoint finite subsets of @xmath81 , and let @xmath778 be three other ones , such that these triples are distinct .",
    "then without loss of generality , it can be assumed that @xmath779 . assume first that there is a point @xmath780 .",
    "if @xmath781 , then the inner product @xmath782 will have a factor @xmath783 , if @xmath784 , the factor will be @xmath785 , whereas if @xmath786 it will be @xmath787 .",
    "hence the two vectors are orthogonal .",
    "if @xmath788 , then either @xmath789 , @xmath790 or @xmath791 . in the first case there is @xmath792 . then @xmath793 . if @xmath794 , then the inner product get a factor @xmath795 , whereas if @xmath796 the factor is @xmath797 , which vanishes as well .",
    "the same argument holds in all other cases leading to the result .",
    "@xmath228      * proof : * since elements of @xmath755 are orthogonal to @xmath799 they are generated by linear combination of the @xmath800 s with @xmath801 . since they come from the commutative sub - algebra @xmath802 they are generated by the operators @xmath803 , namely by the @xmath804 s only .",
    "@xmath228    * proof of theorem  [ mott09.th-spectdiss ] ( continued ) : * let @xmath805 be the operator on @xmath242 defined by @xmath806 in much the same way , let @xmath807 be defined by @xmath808 it follows that if @xmath809 with @xmath810 and @xmath811 then @xmath812 and the same holds for @xmath813 . since @xmath814 can only be a linear combination of @xmath815 , it is enough to consider each of these cases . this leads to @xmath816 @xmath817 since @xmath818 it follows immediately that @xmath819 and @xmath820 are both eigenvectors of @xmath745 for the common eigenvalue @xmath821 this means @xmath822 and @xmath823 are eigenvectors of @xmath824 with eigenvalue @xmath825 .",
    "similarly , an elementary calculation shows that @xmath826 where @xmath827    hence , @xmath824 has pure point spectrum .",
    "in addition , @xmath828 vanishes if and only if @xmath829 .",
    "this shows that @xmath799 is the only eigenvector with eigenvalues @xmath753 .",
    "it shows also that @xmath755 is invariant by @xmath752 and , thanks to the corollary  [ mott09.cor-cgortho ] , the restriction of @xmath752 on @xmath755 is bounded below by @xmath152 ( uniformly in @xmath830 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "let @xmath831 , then one has @xmath832 and @xmath833 for @xmath834 .",
    "hence , @xmath407 preserves the sub - algebra @xmath802 .",
    "moreover @xmath835 , showing that @xmath628 leaves the subspace @xmath755 invariant . as @xmath836 it follows that @xmath753 is a simple eigenvalue of @xmath628 and that @xmath628 has at least the same gap as @xmath824 .",
    "@xmath228    [ mott09.rem-gamma3 ] if @xmath152 is not constant but depends on @xmath101 and @xmath139 as specified by remark  [ mott09.rem-gamma2 ] then and are still correct .",
