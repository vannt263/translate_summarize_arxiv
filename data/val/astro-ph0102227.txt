    "spectral features originating as a result of reprocessing of energetic x  ray radiation by cool , optically thick plasma around accreting compact objects can be extremely helpful in constraining the geometry of accretion flows .",
    "indeed , one of the strongest evidences for the existence of accretion discs very close to central black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) came from observations of broad profiles of the fluorescent iron line near 6.4 kev in many seyfert 1 galaxies , the _ asca _ result from ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ) being the best known case .",
    "the broad line profile is unlikely to be explained as a result of comptonization in transmission through a plasma cloud ( fabian et al .",
    "1995 ) , so broadening as a result of doppler effects and gravitational redshift seems to be the main mechanism ( although comptonization in reflection can contribute to the broadening ; karas et al .",
    "quantitative estimates of the distances of the cold plasma from central black holes based on the line profiles indicate an intrinsic dispersion of parameters among the sources ( nandra et al .  1997 ; done , madejski & ycki 2000 ) , but generally yield the distance @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "data analyzed in most cases are integrated over relatively long periods of time ( @xmath3days ) in order to decrease statistical errors .",
    "they are therefore averages over many dynamical timescales , @xmath4 , and correspond to time / space average geometrical / physical conditions in the region where the line is produced .",
    "studies of time variability of the line can add a new dimension to inferences based on averaged spectra , as they can potentially resolve the structure of the x ",
    "rays production region .",
    "reverberation analysis ( investigations of the response of the line to variability of the continuum driving its emission ; blandford & mckee 1982 ) can provide independent constraints on the geometry of the emission region ( e.g.  reynolds et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "indeed , a number of surprising results were obtained in those cases where a good quality of data enabled studies of the line variability .",
    "generally , the line absolute flux appears to be less variable than the flux of the driving continuum .",
    "the best example here is the long campaign of rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15 analyzed in reynolds ( 2000 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . the r.m.s .",
    "variability in the line band was reduced to @xmath5 that of the continuum , due to a combination of constant line flux and flux - correlated spectral changes .",
    "similarly , done et al .",
    "( 2000 ) analyzed observations of another seyfert 1 galaxy ic  4329a and found that the absolute amplitude of the reprocessed component stayed roughly constant as the source brightened , i.e.  the relative amplitude decreased somewhat .",
    "chiang et al .  ( 2000 ) found constant line flux in ngc  5548 , even though the 2 - 10 kev continuum flux varied by a factor of 2 .",
    "however , the lack of response of the line integrated flux to the continuum variability does not mean that there are no changes at all .",
    "the profile of the line clearly responds to the continuum variability .",
    "again , the most striking example is mcg6 - 30 - 15 , where the line profile showed quite dramatic changes ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ) : it was narrow during a high flux state but it was very broad when the source s flux decreased .",
    "interestingly , the total flux of the line photons seems to have been constant in time ( see fig .  6 in iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "a suggestion that the line flux can be constant due to ionization of the reprocessor varying in relation to the primary flux were made by reynolds ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , no physical model was proposed for the flux  ionization dependence .",
    "nayakshin , kazanas & kallman ( 2000 ; hereafter nkk ) pointed out that a reduction of the fe line variability can be expected if the disc develops a hot , ionized layer where the line production is inefficient .",
    "development of such an ionized layer is a necessary consequence of the thermal instability operating in x  ray irradiated plasma ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ; raska & czerny 1996 , hereafter rc96 ) . since the thickness of the hot layer and its radial extent are correlated with the illuminating flux , the efficiency of the line production can indeed be anti - correlated with the source x  ray luminosity .",
    "moreover , changes to the radial location of the line emission region will influence the line profile .",
    "the same idea has been proposed by nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) to explain the x - ray `` baldwin effect '' ( baldwin 1977 ; iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) , i.e.  smaller equivalent width of the line for x - ray brighter sources .",
    "the two effects ( the baldwin effect and the lack of reverberation signatures ) can be simply considered as the same effect looked at statistically in a sample of objects and in a time history of a single object , respectively ( `` ergodic theorem '' ) , although the two phenomena may differ in details : x  ray variability of a single source is probably related to variable output of some magnetic activity , while different ( averaged ) luminosities of sources are probably due to different mass accretion rates .    in this paper",
    "we consider and test this model further , based on computations of vertical structure of illuminated accretion discs in hydrostatic equilibrium ( rc96 ; raska 1999 , hereafter r99 ; see also nkk ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : phys ] we sketch the physics of the thermal instability responsible for the two - layer structure of irradiated accretion discs , in section  [ sec : thickness ] we present our method of computing the thickness of the hot layer and results of such computations , section  [ sec : timing ] contains discussion of consequences of the presence of the hot layer for variability properties of accreting objects , while section  [ sec : specdata ] contains similar discussion on spectral properties .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ sec : discus ] .",
    "our physical picture is based on vertical structure of illuminated accretion discs . as a result of illumination",
    "the topmost disc layer can be strongly ionized , but the level of ionization decreases with depth into the disc . in calculations performed with the assumption of constant density ( ross & fabian 1993 ; ycki et al .",
    "1994 ) , the ionization level at the disc surface is given by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the flux of illuminating x - rays and @xmath8 is the electron number density ) and it smoothly decreases inwards . adjusting any of these parameters it is possible to obtain any specified ionization stage .",
    "the picture is rather different when the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium ( or in fact any condition on gas pressure rather than its density ) is additionally imposed in the illuminated disc ( rc96 ; nkk ) .",
    "solutions corresponding to certain range of temperatures ( and/or ionization parameter @xmath9 , more appropriate than @xmath10 for characterizing solutions with pressure constraints ) are thermally unstable ( field 1965 ; krolik et al .  1981 ) . the condition for instability ( field 1965 ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the heat - loss function , can be expressed as @xmath13 the unstable solutions are thus those located on the part of the @xmath14@xmath15 diagram with a negative slope ( krolik et al .  1981 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism for the instability is the weak dependence of bremsstrahlung cooling on temperature , @xmath16 , which can not balance the photoionization heating on heavy elements caused by hard x  rays . on the lower stable branch at @xmath17",
    "k the plasma is cooled by atomic line emission , while on the upper branch , at @xmath18@xmath19 k , compton heating and cooling are the dominant processes .      in an illuminated accretion disc in hydrostatic equilibrium a movement along the @xmath14@xmath15 curve corresponds to changing the depth into the disc . as a result of the instability ,",
    "a broad range of intermediate ionization of iron is inaccessible to a stable solution .",
    "the uniqueness of the solution is assured only when the basic equations : energy equation , hydrostatic equilibrium and radiative transfer equations are supplemented by the heat conduction equation ( macioek - niedwiecki , krolik & zdziarski 1997 ; r99 ) .",
    "the transition from the hot to cold solution branch is very sharp and its location can be obtained from the general condition of radiative  conductive equilibrium ( raska 2000 ) .",
    "the condition gives the temperature at the transition point @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the surface temperature .",
    "for purely radiation heated disc atmosphere @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inverse - compton temperature ( mckee & begelman 1990 ; raska & czerny 2000a ) . when the @xmath24 heating is also included , @xmath21 is somewhat higher than @xmath23 ( raska 2000 ) . in a good approximation ,",
    "the transition occurs where the upper , stable branch of the @xmath15@xmath14 curve changes to the middle , unstable branch ( rc96 , r99 , nkk ) , the resulting structure is then basically two - layered : the upper , hot layer ( hl ) and the lower , cold layer , although there is a thin transition layer in between the two ( r99 ) . for a sufficiently hard illuminating spectra ( i.e.  high @xmath23 )",
    "iron can be considered completely ionized in the hot layer , while it recombines to below fexi in the cold layer ( nkk ; see also fig .  2 in ycki & czerny 1994 ) .",
    "= 6 cm    the model parameter crucial for spectral / timing predictions is the thickness of the hot layer , @xmath25 . the larger the thickness , the smaller the fraction of primary radiation penetrating to the cold layer and giving rise to the usual reprocessed component .",
    "the reprocessed component is further comptonized as the photons escape through the hot layer .",
    "the result ( at least in the limited energy band corresponding to e.g.   _ ginga _ or data ) is a reprocessed component with amplitude reduced compared to the usual geometrical factor @xmath26 ( eq .  [ equ : refl ] ) , where @xmath27 is the solid angle subtended by the reprocessor from the x  ray source ( done & nayakshin 2001 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the iron spectral features is further reduced by the comptonization .",
    "two most important parameters determining the thickness of the hot layer are : the strength of irradiation compared to internal disc emission , @xmath28 , and the ratio of gravity at the base of the layer to x  ray radiation pressure ( rc96 , nkk ) . following nkk we parameterize the latter by @xmath29 where @xmath30 where @xmath31 for cosmic abundance .",
    "obviously then , the structure of the hot layer has to be solved simultaneously with the structure of the cold disc , since @xmath32 depends on the disc thickness , @xmath33 .",
    "nkk used vertically averaged solutions of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ; hereafter ss ) for the disc in their computations of @xmath25 . they assumed that total pressure , @xmath34 , should be continuous across the boundary between the two layers , and obtained both @xmath35 and @xmath36 individually continuous across the boundary .    in this paper",
    "we explicitly solve equations of vertical structure of the cold disc .",
    "we do this for the @xmath0 ss disc , i.e.  a disc with energy generation proportional to total pressure .",
    "we define the input parameters of the computations in such a way as to make the connection between accretion discs models and observable quantities obvious .",
    "first , we describe calculations at a given radius and then discuss radial dependence of @xmath25 .",
    "the structure of the hl at a given radius is computed by combining the method of rc96 and r99 with computations of the vertical structure of x - ray illuminated discs by raska et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for the hl",
    "we follow closely the method of rc96 and r99 , with the important simplification of neglecting thermal conduction .",
    "the reason is purely practical , as efforts to fully combine proper photo - ionization computations of the hot layer with vertical disc structure have only just begun ( dumont , abrassart & collin 2000 ; raska et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this leaves us with an important problem of selecting proper solution in the zone of instability , where the system of equations has more than one solution for temperature .",
    "we adopt a simple prescription and select the highest value of @xmath14 as the solution . comparing solutions with and without conduction in rc96 and r99 one sees that our procedure may overestimate somewhat the total thickness of the hot and transition layers ( i.e.  the depth of the point where @xmath37 ) . however , the thickness of the hot layer alone is not affected by our neglecting the thermal conduction .",
    "the spectrum of illuminating radiation is assumed to be a power law with a cutoff , @xmath38 , parameterized by the photon spectral index @xmath39 and cutoff energy , @xmath40 .",
    "equations of vertical structure of the cold disc are the same as in raska et al .",
    "we assume that a certain fraction of gravitational energy , @xmath10 , is dissipated within the disc ( but the disc transports all the angular momentum , see e.g.  witt , czerny & ycki 1997 ) .",
    "the remaining fraction , @xmath41 , is dissipated in an active corona and converted to hard x - ray radiation , of which a fraction @xmath42 illuminates the disk , i.e. @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gravitational energy dissipation per unit area of the disc surface .",
    "value of @xmath45 would thus correspond to a stationary illumination by an x - ray producing corona above the disk , assuming isotropic emission ( see e.g.  haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .",
    "we will assume @xmath46 , corresponding to a possible enhancement of the x  ray flux .",
    "such an enhancement can be expected if the x  rays are produced by magnetic flares , due to 1 ) the `` charge '' time of a flare being longer than the `` discharge '' time , 2 ) the collecting area for the flare energy being larger than the illuminated area ( e.g.  haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "we solve the structure of the hl assuming a certain initial geometrical thickness of the total system , @xmath47 .",
    "four parameters , computed at the bottom of the hl , are then used to modify the equations of the disc structure and their boundary conditions :    * location of the bottom of the hl ( height above the equatorial plane ) gives the initial thickness of the cold disc , * the hard x - ray flux attenuated by the hl contributes to heating of the disc .",
    "* the temperature at the top of the cold disc is computed from the eddington approximation , @xmath48^{1/4}$ ] , taking @xmath49 to be equal to the optical depth of the hl , and @xmath50 from both the internal energy dissipation and the irradiation , * gas pressure at the bottom of the hl determines the gas density at the top of the disk .",
    "iterations of the vertical structure of the disc now follow , to compute the disc thickness for given disc dissipation @xmath51 , with the boundary conditions as above .",
    "usually , the converged thickness of the disc is different than the initially assumed one . therefore the final solution ( at a given radius @xmath52 and for an assumed central mass @xmath53 , mass accretion rate @xmath54 , and viscosity parameter , @xmath55 ) is obtained by iterating @xmath47 until a consistent solution is found .",
    "as already mentioned above , we define @xmath25 as the thickness of the layer where temperature changes from @xmath21 down to @xmath56 .    as a reference ,",
    "we compute @xmath25 for parameters appropriate for a seyfert 1 galaxy : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( close to the peak in energy dissipation ) , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath45 ( i.e.  no enhancement ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 kev .",
    "figure  [ fig : vert1 ] shows an example of the vertical structure of the disc with the hot layer .",
    "the thomson thickness of hl is rather small , @xmath64 , irrespectively of @xmath55 .",
    "the `` gravity parameter '' is @xmath65 in this case .",
    "our value of @xmath25 is thus very similar to what nkk obtain for this value of @xmath32 ( see fig .  4 in nkk ) , demonstrating that , despite some approximations in our procedure , our results are accurate .    the main parameter , @xmath32 , is a non - unique function of other parameters of the system . for given @xmath66 and @xmath52 , @xmath32",
    "is determined by a combination of @xmath10 and @xmath67 : both parameters influence the disc thickness and the irradiation flux .",
    "we have therefore extended our reference computations to obtain @xmath25 on a grid of @xmath10 and @xmath67 .",
    "results are plotted in figure  [ fig : cont1 ] , where we show a number of quantities characterizing the disc or the spectrum .",

    "they are defined as ratios of the transmitted and reflected flux to the incident flux , respectively , for a purely scattering atmosphere .",

    "this is a rather approximate estimate of the angle averaged amplitude , since it assumes no photo - absorption in the hl , i.e.  no contribution to the reprocessed spectrum from highly ( but not completely ) ionized elements .",
    "it thus assumes a rather hard illuminating spectrum ( @xmath79 ) giving high @xmath23 .",
    "a more accurate procedure of estimating @xmath77 was employed by done & nayakshin ( 2001 ) , who fitted spectra computed by nkk by a `` cold '' reflection model in the context of _ ginga _ data . for softer illuminating spectra , @xmath80 ,",
    "the reprocessed component contains strong spectral features due to h- and he - like fe ions and it can not be approximated by `` cold '' reprocessing ( nkk ; nayakshin 2000b ) .",

    "we note that the above relations of @xmath87 and @xmath83 with @xmath7 assume implicitly that there are no significant changes of the source geometry ( e.g.  the height of the flare above the disc ) , so that the variability of @xmath7 is solely due to the variable output of the magnetic activity .",
    "the structure of the disc has to be rather different from the standard ss solution , if the hot layer is to be thomson thick(ish ) , @xmath88 .",
    "for half of the total energy dissipated in the active regions , @xmath61 , the illumination flux has to be further enhanced by a factor of @xmath89 relative to the stationary situation in order to obtain @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to the ratio of illumination flux to disc internal flux , @xmath91 . for larger fraction of energy dissipated in the magnetic corona , i.e.  smaller @xmath10 ,",
    "the required ratio @xmath28 is even larger ( e.g.  @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) .",
    "this appears to be due to the disc thickness , @xmath33 , increasing with @xmath10 more slowly than linearly , and thus for @xmath94 to remain constant , @xmath28 has to increase when @xmath10 decreases .    on the other hand",
    ", the presence of the hl will be apparent in observations even if its thickness is rather smaller than @xmath90 . according to our approximate formula (",

    "a consequence of that particular @xmath104 distribution is a relative suppression of highly relativistically smeared component of the reprocessed spectrum . on the other hand , the reprocessed photons that do manage to diffuse from below the hot layer close to the central bh , suffer comptonization smearing , which in practice may be difficult to distinguish from relativistic smearing ( see sec .",

    "the model requires @xmath164 in order to obtain quantitative agreement with the data , i.e.  @xmath165 of the soft flux crossing an active region .",
    "it has to be remembered however that the observed correlation , particularly among different objects , is more likely to be due to changes of geometry driven by e.g.  @xmath66 rather than varying output of magnetic activity , and thus parameterizing the correlation by our parameters @xmath10 and @xmath67 may not be sufficient .",
    "another correlation applicable to agn observations may be the @xmath87@xmath39 ( anti)correlation plotted in figure  [ fig : r_vs_gamma]b .",

    "( [ equ : fhard ] ) holds ) , the predicted @xmath87@xmath39 anticorrelation is obtained .",
    "however , an opposite effect seems to be observed in the data from observing campaigns of some agn , where the spectrum generally softens ( @xmath39 increases ) when the observed x  ray flux goes up ( ngc 5548 , chiang et al .",

    "at least in ic  4329a the spectral analysis of done et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reveals that this is not an artifact of limited band pass of instruments .",
    "if this observational result is generic , it would mean changes of the flares geometry correlated with their luminosity , so that the relation between @xmath87 and @xmath7 can be reversed .",
    "from the discussion of variability ( sec  [ sec : reductvar ] ) , we need a correlated increase of @xmath25 with the flare luminosity .",
    "if this is to be accompanied by a softening of the spectrum , the flare s geometry has to change in such a way , that the intercepted soft luminosity is larger than the increased hard luminosity ( @xmath166 has to decrease ; eq .",

    "[ sec : rad1 ] .",
    "the line generation is then suppressed at small @xmath52 , which means that the inner disc radius determined from the line profile may be larger than @xmath167 .",
    "we quantified this effect in our model , since indeed the line observed in a number of sources is narrower than in the extreme case of mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( ic  4329a , done et al .",
    "2000 ; cyg x-1 , done & ycki 1999 ; gs  2023 + 338 , gs  1124 - 68 , ycki , done & smith 1997 , 1998 ) .",

    "ratios of the reprocessed spectra to the reference case of no hot skin ( so full relativistic smearing ) , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : smearats ] .",
    "the magnitude of the effect obviously depends on the thickness of the hl . even for the thickest hl considered ( @xmath168 , maximum @xmath169 ) ,",
    "the `` wiggles '' in the ratio plots are only a few percent , for pure reprocessed component , i.e.  no contribution from primary photons .",
    "it would then be rather difficult to detect such an effect in the data , the more so that the additional broadening due to comptonization in the hl ( not included here ) , is strongest for the thickest hl .",
    "qualitatively then , reduction of effective amplitude of the reprocessed component is much more prominent , than any changes to the profile of the line ( as is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : smearats ] ) .",
    "= 0.45    one can estimate the maximum magnitude of the suppression of the broadest line component , noticing that it will occur for @xmath104 being a step function : @xmath25 very large for radii @xmath170 , and @xmath171 otherwise .",
    "in other words , no observable reprocessed component is produced for @xmath172 ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "this obviously means a reduction of the effective amplitude of the reprocessed component , which one can relate to @xmath173    to do so , we write @xmath174 , i.e.  @xmath77 is the reflection albedo ( ratio of flux of reflected radiation to the flux directed towards an observer ) , normalized to the albedo @xmath175 of cold reflection , expected from an isotropic source above a flat disc . both fluxes can be written as radial integrals , e.g.   @xmath176 averaged over many dynamical time scales , the radial distribution of energy generation in the active corona can be expected to follow the gravitational energy dissipation prescription .",
    "if isotropy of emission is assumed , then @xmath177 if a purely scattering layer of a thickness giving a transmission probability @xmath178 ( reflection probability @xmath179 ) covers the reflecting disc up to a radius @xmath173 , then @xmath180 and @xmath181 the resulting function @xmath182 is plotted in figure  [ fig : rin_vs_r ] for @xmath183 , which maximizes @xmath173 for any @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath184 ( no hot layer ) we obviously obtain @xmath185 , but for any @xmath186 the amplitude @xmath77 decreases dramatically with increasing @xmath173 , i.e.  when the ionized zone becomes more extended .",
    "the reason for the dramatic decrease is that the emission is strongly concentrated towards the center .",
    "interestingly , many galactic black hole binaries show @xmath187 and @xmath188 , in accord with the relation shown in figure  [ fig : rin_vs_r ] , but we note that , with the assumption of perfect reflectivity , the geometry here is equivalent to the disc being truncated at @xmath173 , and replaced by central x  ray source .",
    "we also emphasize that the assumption @xmath189 , is not justified by our present understanding of the model .",
    "= 0.45      the observed equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe line appears to be anticorrelated with average 210 kev luminosities of the sources ( iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) , in a similar manner as ew of civ @xmath1901550 line is anticorrelated with the uv continuum luminosity ( baldwin 1977 ) .",
    "this could be explained by the presence of the hot layer , since indeed @xmath25 is larger for larger @xmath7 , although in this case we expect the flux to be driven by accretion rate , rather than @xmath10 and/or @xmath67 . since the average x  ray luminosity can be expected to be proportional to the accretion rate @xmath191 , we have computed the ew varying either @xmath53 or @xmath66 and keeping the other parameter constant .",
    "we again assumed that situation at @xmath59 is characteristic to the whole disc , and we adopted @xmath61 and @xmath45 .",
    "results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewlum ] show that indeed the ew of the line ( @xmath192 ) decreases with @xmath66 .",
    "the reason for the underlying increase of @xmath25 with @xmath66 is that the increase of @xmath33 with @xmath66 is slower than linear .",
    "the gravity parameter @xmath193 then decreases with @xmath66 .",
    "we note that the vertically averaged ss solution predicts @xmath194 and , in consequence , constant @xmath25 in the regime of @xmath195 and @xmath196 . in our vertically explicit solution @xmath35",
    "is not neglected .",
    "contribution from convective energy transfer contributes to departures from the ss solution as well .",
    "presence of a hot , ionized layer on top of an x  ray illuminated accretion disc has inevitable observational consequences .",
    "most importantly , it reduces the amplitude of the effective , observed `` cold '' reprocessed component . since the thickness of the hot layer ( hence the reduced amplitude )",
    "is correlated with the x  ray flux , a number of observable correlations follow from this model .",
    "generally , the predicted fe fluorescent line originating from the disc is weaker ( relative to the continuum ) when the source is brighter ( provided that the illuminating spectrum has @xmath197 so that there is no he - like fe in the hot layer ; nkk ) .",
    "this effect can be used to explain two observed phenomena .",
    "firstly , the reduction of the amplitude of variability of the line with respect to the driving continuum ( @xmath198 kev ) in agn monitoring campaigns ( reynolds 2000 ; done et al .  2000 ;",
    "chiang et al .  2000 ) .",
    "quantitatively , our computations indicate that it is not possible to obtain constant absolute line flux constant .",
    "that is , the relative amplitude of the reprocessed component decreases more slowly than @xmath199 .",
    "nevertheless , reduction of the variablity amplitude by a few per cent is possible .",
    "however , the variability reduction is inversly related with the mean amplitude of the reprocessed component ( i.e.  observed at the mean flux level ) .",
    "thus , in sources like mcg6 - 30 - 15 , where @xmath200 , this effect should actually be negligible .",
    "moreover , the x  ray continuum in is rather soft ( @xmath80 ) , which implies a contribution from a highly ionized reprocessed component ( nkk ) , that does not seem to have been observed in this source .",
    "perhaps the hot skin developes on accretion discs in the other seyfert 1 galaxies , where both @xmath201 and @xmath3constant fe line flux was observed ( ic  4329a , done et al .",
    "2000 ; ngc  5548 , chiang et al .",
    "quality of current data should be good enough to quantitatively test the model relation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : reductvar ] .",
    "second , the decrease of the ew of the fe line in brighter sources ( x  ray `` baldwin effect '' ) can be explained , if the inverse relation between efficiency of the line production and x  ray flux is applied to a sample of objects .",
    "this is not quite a trivial statement , since different average x  ray luminosities of sources are rather due to different mass accretion rates , than a variable output of some magnetic activity .",
    "the model is also able to explain the correlation between the amplitude of the reprocessed component and x  ray spectral index , again observed both in a sample of objects ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ) , and in the time history of a single object ( gx  339 - 4 , gilfanov et al .",
    "2000 ; gs  1124 - 68 , ycki et al .  1998 ) .",
    "our computations of the correlation give perhaps somewhat different shape to what is observed , although the observed correlation is also subject to instrument  related uncertainties .",
    "another relation often looked for in data and used to constrain theoretical models is a relation between spectral index and hard x  ray flux .",
    "this is usually more difficult to obtain from data because of uncertain corrections from limited detector band pass to the entire x  ray band .",
    "perhaps the most robust result was obtained by done et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for ic  4329a , where broad band spectral analysis revealed that the spectrum became harder when the x  rays ( @xmath202 kev ) decreased .",
    "similar relation was reported for ngc  5548 ( magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ; chiang et al .",
    "2000 ) although this involved flux in 210 kev band . on the other hand the soft x  ray",
    "transient gs  1124 - 68 ( nova muscae 1991 ) showed a clear hardening of its spectrum during its decline phase ( ycki et al .",
    "1998 ; ycki 2001 ) , which was however correlated with an _ increase _ of the @xmath203 flux by @xmath204 per cent ( so called re - flare ) .",
    "the model discussed in this work predicts anti - correlation of @xmath39 and @xmath87 , i.e.  hardening of the spectrum when a source brightens , unless there are correlated changes of the x  ray source geometry and its luminosity .",
    "the structure of the hot layer and resulting correlations between observables may also depend upon the model adopted for the underlying accretion disc .",
    "in this paper we adopted the @xmath0 ss prescription for viscosity .",
    "however such discs are subject to a number of instabilities in the parameter range appropriate to agn .",
    "classical theory predics thermal and viscous instability whenever contribution of gas pressure to @xmath205 drops below 0.4 ( kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 ) , which in practice means the region within a few hundreds @xmath206 , for @xmath66 a few per cent .",
    "therefore , models with a different viscosity prescription were sometimes considered , e.g.  @xmath207 , which are free from those instabilities .",
    "solving the vertical structure of @xmath207 discs for a number of ( @xmath208 ) values we find that the disc height is very similar ( less than 1 per cent difference ) to that of the corresponding @xmath0 disc .",
    "the resulting relations between observable quantities are then practically identical to those for @xmath0 discs .",
    "our current understanding of mechanisms providing viscosity strongly points out towards the magneto - rotational instability as the source of turbulence responsible for the viscosity ( see balbus & hawley 1998 for review ) .",
    "global magnetohydrodynamical simulations reveal the disc structure very different from the smooth , classical , hydrodynamical models ( hawley 2000 ) . the spatial and temporal structure is highly turbulent and inhomogeneous , displaying fractal - like scalings ( kawaguchi et al .",
    "the relevance of the presented model to such inhomogeneous , clumpy discs needs further studies .",
    "the presented model is currently one of at least three general scenarios within which it is possible to explain bulk of observed data from low / hard states of agn and gbh : the other two are the cold disc with inner hot flow model ( esin et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ; raska & czerny 2000b ) and relativistically outflowing plasma model ( beloborodov 1999ab ) .",
    "none of them fully addresses all complexities of observed spectral and timing data , but all three account for the main facts : the range of observed spectral indices , the @xmath77@xmath39 correlation , relativistic smearing of fe reprocessed features ( see poutanen 1998 for review and e.g.  di salvo et al .",
    "2001 for application to cyg x-1 )",
    ". it also seems possible to incorporate into all of them the basic x  ray timing observables : the shape of psd , time lags , auto- and cross - correlation functions ( poutanen & fabian 1999 ; bttcher & liang 1999 ; see review in poutanen 2000 ) .",
    "clearly , further progress can only be made if the models are developed in more details incorporating more relevant physical processes .",
    "confronting detailed , quantitative predictions with good quality spectral and timing data should hopefully enable distinguishing which , if any , of our current ideas are closest to reality .",
    "* the model does predict certain reduction of the variability of the fe line , compared to the variability of its driving continuum , although it does not seem possible to obtain absolutely constant line flux .",
    "* the anti - correlation of the equivalent width of the line and average source luminosity ( the x  ray `` baldwin effect '' ) is reproduced in the model .",
    "* reduction of the amplitude of the observed , `` cold '' reprocessed component is more evident than any reduction of the spectral broadening ( due to relativistic effects and comptonization ) of the line . *",
    "the model is able to quantitatively explain the observed @xmath77-@xmath39 correlation . * the geometry of the x ",
    "ray sources is quite tightly constrained , if the model is to explain both timing and spectral observational data .",

    "<S> the ionized skin appears as a result of the thermal instability of x  ray irradiated plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we test this hypothesis by computing the thomson thickness of the hot skin on top of the @xmath0 shakura  sunyaev disc , by simultaneously solving the vertical structure of both the hot skin and the disc . </S>",
    "<S> we then compute a number of relations between observable quantities , e.g.   the hard x  ray flux , amplitude of the observed reprocessed component , relativistic smearing of the line , the r.m.s .  </S>",
    "<S> variability of the hard x  rays . </S>",
    "<S> these relations can be compared to present and future observations . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that this mechanism is unlikely to explain the behaviour of the x  ray source in mcg6 - 30 - 15 , where there is a number of arguments against the existence of a thick hot skin , but it can work for some other seyfert 1 galaxies .    </S>",
