    "invisibility cloaks that were introduced ten years ago @xcite are undoubtedly the most popular application of artificial materials @xcite , since they offer an unprecedented control over light trajectories @xcite . in order to make objects invisible to electromagnetic radiation , numerous methods have been suggested in the past few years .",
    "the first attempt can be traced back to kerker and his consideration of core - shell dielectric bodies .",
    "he noted forty years ago that in the static regime , some combinations of dielectric functions lead to cancellation of the scattering cross - section of coated ellipsoidal and spherical inclusions @xcite . al and engheta further investigated the scattering cancellation technique and have shown that the use of plasmonic materials can lead to invisibility via the polarizability engineering of the coating shell @xcite .",
    "this technique has the advantage of being robust @xcite and experimentally realizable @xcite .",
    "it has also many applications in sensing @xcite or imaging @xcite .",
    "variants of this technique have been also investigated , e.g. by using plasmonic nano particles for optical cloaking @xcite or mantle covers @xcite .",
    "different methods based on homogenization have been also shown to lead to broadband cloaking of electromagnetic waves @xcite .    in the same vein",
    ", the scattering cancellation technique has been successfully adapted to other kinds of waves .",
    "in fact , chen _ et al . _ have shown that spherical objects can be made invisible to acoustic pressure waves by coating them with ultra - thin tailored shells with properly designed acoustic impedance @xcite .",
    "the same technique has shown its potential even for the scalar elasticity domain ( thin - plates ) , where waves obey the fourth order scalar biharmonic equation @xcite , or thermal waves @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the propagation of diffuse photon density waves ( dpdw ) .",
    "these describe the propagation of light waves in a highly scattering medium , i.e. a turbid medium such as human body tissues , cloud or milk @xcite . in this case ,",
    "photons experience multiple scattering phenomenon before being absorbed by the medium or escaping it .",
    "even though , the individual photons follow random paths , macroscopically , they behave like a photon density wave , described by a helmholtz - like differential equation and experiencing usual wave phenomena such as refraction @xcite scattering @xcite , or even cloaking based on transformation optics @xcite .",
    "we will propose thus to analyze the scattering of dpdw from core - shell structures and derive the conditions of scattering cancellation and resonant scattering regimes .",
    "the latter scenario may have promising applications in medical tissue imaging @xcite by rendering objects more visible or improving the capabilities of hamr technology @xcite .",

    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "in particular , one can notice that the real part @xmath20 tends asymptotical to the limit @xmath21 when the frequency goes to zero , and is much higher than the imaginary part , due to absorption .",
    "at higher frequencies ( @xmath22 ) , the real and imaginary parts are equal [ since @xmath23 is purely imaginary , as can be seen from the low frequency regime in fig .  [ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "in this section , we assume that generation of macroscopic waves ( dpdw ) from sinusoidally modulated point sources in a turbid medium is possible @xcite . these are spherical waves that propagate outwards from the point source , and are incident on a core - shell ( spherical ) structure , as schematized in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . the scattering ( and absorbing ) object (",

    "[ fig1](a ) ] and applying the convenient boundary conditions . without loss of generality , we assume the origin of the spherical coordinates to coincide with the center of the core - shell .",
    "let us consider to begin , heterogeneous scattering objects , i.e. with finite values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "outside the structure ( region 0 ) , the general solution is the well - known superposition of incident and scattered waves , i.e. @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the spherical wave created by the source and incident into the structure of fig .",

    "the coefficients of the developments ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) can be determined using the following assumptions : ( i ) @xmath6 is finite for @xmath49 .",

    "this means that the terms for which @xmath61 are identically zero .",
    "these boundary conditions yield , therefore , the different coefficients .",
    "in particular , the scattering coefficients @xmath62 can be re - expressed as @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are given by the complex - valued determinants @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",

    "it is obtained by integrating the scattering amplitude and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath70 in the limit of small scatterers ( long diffusion length @xmath71 ) , only few scattering orders contribute to the scs . here , we assume that the first two orders ( @xmath72 for the monopole , and @xmath73 for the dipole mode , unlike in the electromagnetic case , where the first dominant mode is the dipole one ) are significant . in this scenario",
    ", one has @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , canceling these two modes , i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 , will ensure that @xmath77 , and the _ diffusive _ scattering from the object will be suppressed .",

    "( [ phi_inc]),([phi_scatt ] ) and ( [ phi_shell ] ) remain unchanged but the fluence field becomes identically zero inside the core , i.e. @xmath85 .",

    "the setup of the scattering problem is identical to what was discussed earlier , except that the scattering reduction is achieved here by a 3d surface , instead of a thick shell .",
    "our aim in the following is to show the possibility of drastically reducing the scattering from spherical heterogeneities by properly tailoring the surface impedance .",
    "there are two boundary conditions that should be satisfied at the surface of both spherical obstacle ( on @xmath54 ) and the cloak ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "the spherical bessel functions can be simplified and the approximate cloaking condition ( for the reactance ) can be written as @xmath104 this clearly demonstrates that by properly choosing the diffusive surface reactance ( @xmath105 ) , it is possible , in the quasistatic limit , to suppress the few dominant scattering multipoles .",

    "[ fig3](a ) ] , respectively . when it is surrounded by the cloak , both forward and backward scattering",
    "are nearly vanished , with not too much difference between the dpdw diffusing in homogeneous medium and the wave bent by the cloak .",
    "this reduction of scattering is achieved thanks to the proper choice of the surface diffusive impedance ( reactance ) , which restores almost uniform amplitude all around the cloak .",
    "to conclude , we have studied analytically and numerically cloaking mechanism based on the scattering cancellation technique in the context of diffuse photon density waves . in particular , we have shown that both a cloaking shell with convenient diffusivity and photon lifetime or mantle shell with tailored impedance , can drastically reduce the scattering from a spherical obstacle .",
    "we believe that our results help making the cloaking theory one step closer to its practical realization for diffusive light .",
    "this mechanism can also be used to build noninvasive medical imaging devices ( e.g. , ultrasound imaging ) with moderately broadband features .",
    "finally , our analysis of the light diffusion equation carried out in this paper has unveiled some new mathematical and physical features of dpdw cloaking , unseen in the context of heat diffusion , but also in acoustic , optical or mechanical waves .",
    "geometric transform based designs of light diffusion cloaks should thus lead to a whole new range of exciting effects that would require specific theoretical , numerical and experimental investigation .",
