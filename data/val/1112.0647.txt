    "the concept of determinants evolved as early as 1545 when girolamo cardano tried to solve systems of linear equations .",
    "the mathematics community slowly realized the importance of determinants ; we had to wait for more than 200 years before someone formally defined the term `` determinant '' .",
    "it was first introduced by carl friedrich gau  in his _ disquisitiones arithmeticae _ in 1801 .",
    "determinants possess many nice properties and formulas such as multiplicativity , invariance under row operations , cramer s rule , etc .",
    "every student nowadays learns how to compute the determinant of a specific given matrix , say , with fixed dimension and containing numeric quantities as entries . on the other hand , there are lots of matrices with symbolic entries that have a nice closed - form formula for arbitrary dimension .",
    "the first example in the history of mathematics and still the most prominent one is the vandermonde matrix .",
    "starting in the mid 1970 s , the importance of evaluating determinants became even more significant when people related counting problems from combinatorics to the evaluation of certain determinants .",
    "evaluating determinants of matrices whose dimension varies according to a parameter is a delicate problem but at the same time a very important one . around the same time",
    "the field of computer algebra emerged .",
    "doron zeilberger was amongst the first mathematicians to realize the importance of computer algebra algorithms for combinatorial problems , special function identities , symbolic summation , and many more . in his paper",
    "@xcite he built the bridge between these two topics , namely , symbolic determinant evaluation and computer algebra , and since then his _ holonomic ansatz _ has been successfully applied to many problems related to the evaluation of determinants .",
    "the most prominent one is probably a notorious conjecture from enumerative combinatorics , the so - called @xmath0-tspp conjecture , which was the only remaining open problem from the famous list  @xcite by richard stanley ( it also appeared in  @xcite ) until it was recently proved  @xcite using zeilberger s holonomic ansatz .    in this paper , we solve some of the problems that are listed in christian krattenthaler s complement  @xcite to his celebrated essay  @xcite ( the attentive reader may already have observed that our title is an allusion to this reference ) . at the same time",
    "we show that the holonomic ansatz can be modified in various ways in order to apply it to particular problems that could not be addressed with the original method .",
    "for sake of self - containedness we recall briefly the original holonomic ansatz for determinant evaluations as it was proposed by zeilberger  @xcite .",
    "its steps are completely automatic and produce a rigorous proof  provided that they can be successfully carried out in the example at hand . in particular",
    ", the approach relies on the existence of a `` nice '' description for an auxiliary function ( it appears as @xmath1 below ) ; if such a description does not exist then the holonomic ansatz fails .",
    "that s why we call it an `` approach '' or an `` ansatz '' , rather than an algorithm .    generally speaking ,",
    "zeilberger s holonomic ansatz addresses determinant evaluations of the type @xmath2 where the entries @xmath3 of the @xmath4 matrix  @xmath5 and the ( conjectured ) evaluation  @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is required for all @xmath8 ) are explicitly given .",
    "the underlying principle is an induction argument on  @xmath9 .",
    "the base case @xmath10 is easily checked .",
    "now assume that the determinant evaluation has been proven for @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , it follows that @xmath12 is nonzero by the general assumption on  @xmath6 .",
    "hence the rows of @xmath13 are linearly independent and thus the linear system @xmath14 has a unique solution . in the well - known laplace expansion formula ( here with respect to the last row )",
    "@xmath15 the expression @xmath16 is called the @xmath17-cofactor of  @xmath5 .",
    "the minor @xmath18 is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing the @xmath9-th row and the @xmath19-th column .",
    "the above linear system has been constructed in such a way that the entry  @xmath1 in its solution is precisely the @xmath17-cofactor of  @xmath5 divided by its @xmath20-cofactor ( which is just the @xmath21-determinant ) .",
    "this fact can easily be seen by cramer s rule , i.e. , by considering the matrix @xmath22 that we obtain from @xmath5 by replacing the last row by the @xmath23-th row . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the laplace expansion of @xmath22 corresponds exactly to the @xmath23-th equation in our linear system .",
    "now the determinant of @xmath5 is given by @xmath25 to complete the induction step it remains to show that this expression is equal to  @xmath6 .",
    "the problem is that we can not expect to obtain a closed - form expression for the quantity  @xmath1 ( otherwise , we certainly would be able to derive a closed form for the determinant and we were done ) .",
    "instead , we will guess an implicit , recursive definition for a bivariate sequence  @xmath1 and then prove that it satisfies @xmath26 from the first two identities which correspond to the linear system given above , it follows that our guessed  @xmath1 is indeed the normalized @xmath17-cofactor .",
    "identity   then certifies that the determinant evaluates to  @xmath6 .",
    "hence the sequence  @xmath1 plays the rle of a certificate for the determinant evaluation .",
    "now what kind of implicit definition for  @xmath1 could we think of ?",
    "of course , there was a good reason for zeilberger to name his approach the `` holonomic ansatz '' .",
    "that is to say , because he had the class of holonomic functions ( or better , sequences ) in mind when he formulated his approach . in short ,",
    "this class consists of multi - dimensional sequences that satisfy linear recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients , such that the sequence is uniquely determined by specifying _",
    "finitely many _ initial values ( we omit some additional technical conditions here ) .",
    "what makes the use of this class of sequences convenient is the fact that it is not only closed under the basic arithmetic operations ( addition , multiplication ) , but also under more advanced operations such as specialization , diagonalization , and definite summation ; all these are needed to prove , , and .",
    "moreover , there exist known algorithms for performing zero tests and the previously mentioned operations . for more details on holonomic functions and related algorithms",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus if the matrix entries  @xmath3 are holonomic and if luckily the auxiliary function @xmath1 turns out to be holonomic , then the approach will succeed to produce a recurrence for the quotient @xmath27 .",
    "in the context of enumerating certain classes of plane partitions , namely , cyclically symmetric ones and descending ones , george andrews  @xcite encountered an intriguing determinant which he posed as a challenging problem . in krattenthaler s survey  @xcite , it appears as _",
    "problem 34_. this conjecture does not even deal with a closed - form evaluation , but it is `` only '' about the quotient of two consecutive determinants ; a situation that strongly suggests to employ zeilberger s holonomic ansatz !    [ thm.34 ] let the determinant  @xmath28 be defined by @xmath29 where  @xmath30 is an indeterminate and @xmath31 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "then the following relation holds : @xmath32    by looking at the first few evaluations of  @xmath28 ( for @xmath33 they are explicitly displayed in  @xcite ) , we see that only the quotient @xmath34 is nice , but not @xmath35 .",
    "the reason is the occurrence of irreducible nonlinear factors that change every two steps , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 share the same `` ugly '' factor ( thus their quotient is nice ) , but in @xmath38 the `` ugly '' part will be different ( and therefore the quotient @xmath35 does not factor nicely ) .",
    "we first tried zeilberger s original approach on the determinant  @xmath28 .",
    "but we did nt even succeed to guess the recurrences for  @xmath1 as they either are extraordinarily large or do not exist at all .",
    "moreover , we have good reasons to believe that the quotient @xmath35 is not holonomic ( see section  [ sec.chall ] ) , in which case we know a priori that the approach can not succeed",
    ".    therefore we have to come up with a variation of zeilberger s approach , that pays attention to even  @xmath9 only .",
    "this means that we consider the normalized cofactors @xmath1 only for matrices of even size .",
    "the new identities , to be verified , will be @xmath39    in order to come up with an appropriate guess for the yet unknown function  @xmath1 , we compute the normalized cofactors for all even - size matrices up to dimension  @xmath40 .",
    "this gives a @xmath41 array with values in @xmath42 that is used for guessing linear recurrences for  @xmath1 .",
    "for this step , kauers s mathematica package ` guess ` has been employed , see  @xcite for more details . to give the reader an impression of what the output looks like",
    ", we display the results here in truncated form : whenever the abbreviation @xmath43 appears , it indicates that this polynomial can not be factored into smaller pieces , and that for better readability it is not displayed in full size here .",
    "@xmath44    @xmath45    when translated into operator notation , the two recurrences   and   constitute a grbner basis of the left ideal that they generate in the corresponding operator algebra . as a consequence it follows that they are compatible ; this means that starting from some given initial values , these recurrences will always produce the same value for a particular @xmath46 , independently from the order in which they are applied .",
    "the support of the recurrences suggests that fixing the initial values @xmath47 and @xmath48 is sufficient : would produce @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , and then could be used to obtain the full array of values @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately it is not that easy , since there are two disturbing phenomena .",
    "the first is the factor @xmath52 that appears in both leading coefficients .",
    "hence for computing @xmath53 none of the recurrences is applicable and we are stuck . note that the factor @xmath54 in the leading coefficient of   is not a problem since we can use   instead .",
    "we overcome the problem with @xmath53 by finding a recurrence of the form @xmath55\\ ] ] in the ideal generated by and  .",
    "the coefficient  @xmath56 does not vanish for @xmath57 , and thus , together with the additional initial value  @xmath58 , the recurrence allows to compute the values  @xmath53 .",
    "the second unpleasant phenomenon is the free parameter  @xmath30 which can cause the same effect for certain choices .",
    "for example , if @xmath59 then we can not compute @xmath60 from the given initial values since both leading coefficients vanish simultaneously by virtue of the factors @xmath54 and @xmath61 . we handle it by restricting the parameter  @xmath30 to the real numbers @xmath62 for a certain @xmath63 , and by showing that all our calculations are sound under this assumption ( in most cases we use @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) .",
    "but since the determinant for every @xmath66 is a polynomial in  @xmath30 we can extend our result afterwards to all @xmath67 .",
    "alternatively , one can argue that @xmath30 is a formal parameter and therefore expressions like @xmath68 are not zero as they are considered as elements in the polynomial ring @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "we have now prepared the stage for executing the main part of zeilberger s approach .",
    "identity   is easily shown with the help of recurrence  : substituting @xmath70 produces a recurrence for the entries  @xmath53 , which together with the initial values implies that @xmath71 for all  @xmath9 .",
    "identities   and are proven automatically as well , since they are standard applications of holonomic closure properties and summation techniques ( creative telescoping ) . for these tasks",
    "we have used the first author s mathematica package ` holonomicfunctions `  @xcite . the interested reader is invited to study our computations in detail , by downloading the electronic supplementary material from our webpage  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we propose a variant of zeilberger s holonomic ansatz , described in section  [ sec.zeil ] , that enlarges the class of determinants which can be treated by this kind of ansatz .",
    "the condition @xmath72 for all @xmath8 imposes already some restriction . for example , when studying a pfaffian  @xmath73 for some skew - symmetric matrix  @xmath74 , one could be tempted to apply zeilberger s approach to the determinant of  @xmath74 ; recall that @xmath75 .",
    "the problem then is that @xmath76 is zero whenever the dimension of  @xmath74 is odd .",
    "hence one would like to study the quotient @xmath77 instead of the forbidden @xmath27 ; as in the previous section , @xmath9 has to be restricted to the even integers .",
    "this dilemma can be solved by modifying zeilberger s ansatz subject to the laplace expansion of pfaffians , see  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there are determinants which do factor nicely for even dimensions but not for odd ones . also here",
    ", we expect the quotient @xmath78 to be nice , whereas the expression @xmath27 might not even satisfy a linear recurrence and hence could not be handled by zeilberger s holonomic ansatz at all .",
    "similarly when the closed form  @xmath6 is different for even and odd  @xmath9 : while here the original approach could probably work in principle , one may not succeed because of the computational complexity that is caused by studying the quotient @xmath27 , which is expected to be more complicated than @xmath78 .",
    "see theorems  [ thm.35 ] and  [ thm.36 ] below for such examples , which actually have motivated us to propose the following variant .    as we announced",
    "we now generalize zeilberger s method in order to produce a recurrence for the quotient of determinants whose dimensions differ by two . as before , let @xmath79 and let @xmath6 denote the conjectured evaluation of  @xmath80 , which for all @xmath9 in question has to be nonzero .",
    "we pull out of the hat two discrete functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 and verify the following identities :    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    then the determinant evaluation follows as a consequence , using a similar induction argument as in section  [ sec.zeil ] .",
    "let s try to give the motivation for this approach which also explains why it works .",
    "the idea is based on the formula for the determinant of a block matrix : @xmath86 we want to divide the matrix  @xmath87 into blocks such that @xmath88 is a @xmath89 matrix .",
    "let @xmath90 denote the @xmath91 matrix whose first column is @xmath92 and whose second column is @xmath93 . with this notation ,",
    "the two equations   can be written as @xmath94 where the conditions of equation   have been employed to constitute the identity matrix  @xmath95 .",
    "now by the induction hypothesis we may assume that @xmath96 equals @xmath97 , which by our general assumption is nonzero .",
    "thus the above system determines  @xmath98 uniquely and we can write @xmath99 .    finally , we obtain the missing part from the block matrix formula that gives us the quotient @xmath100 , as the determinant of the @xmath89 matrix @xmath101 this is exactly what is expressed in equation  , with all matrix multiplications explicitly written out .    even though it turned out during our research that there is no need to apply the double - step method in the present context , we decided to keep it , as we are sure that it will be useful for future use .",
    "let us also remark that it is straight - forward to generalize this idea in order to produce a triple - step method , etc .",
    "but since the identities to be verified become more and more complicated , we do nt believe that these large - step methods are relevant in practice .",
    "the next determinants we want to study appear as _ conjecture  35 _ and _ conjecture  36 _ in  @xcite .",

    "but still , the evaluation is given as a case distinction between even and odd dimensions of the matrix .",
    "[ thm.35 ] let  @xmath30 be an indeterminate and @xmath9 be a nonnegative integer",
    ". then the determinant @xmath102 equals @xmath103 if @xmath9 is even , and it equals @xmath104 if @xmath9 is odd .",
    "we could try to solve this problem directly , either by zeilberger s original ansatz or in the way we did in section  [ sec.34 ] .",
    "however , this does not work in practice as the computations become too large ( in the second case we were even able to guess the recurrences for @xmath1 , but their size destroyed any hope to prove and  ) .",
    "next , we could give the double - step method a try , which we described in section  [ sec.double ] .",
    "we succeeded to make the proof for some concrete integer  @xmath30 , but again , it seems intractable for symbolic  @xmath30 .",
    "instead we make a small detour and break this determinant into pieces in order to make the calculations smaller . to obtain the desired result ,",
    "we put these pieces together by the desnanot - jacobi adjoint matrix theorem , also known as dodgson s rule ; this formula gave rise to a celebrated algorithmic determinant evaluation method as well  @xcite , but that approach is different from our usage of dodgson s rule .",
    "let us introduce the following notation @xmath105 so that our determinant   is denoted by  @xmath106 . in this notation",
    "the desnanot - jacobi identity is stated as follows : @xmath107 after substituting @xmath108 and @xmath109 in   and using the fact that @xmath110 ( to be shown later ) we have @xmath111 from which the desired quotient can be obtained : @xmath112 similarly , we substitute @xmath109 and @xmath113 into   and use the fact that @xmath114 ( again , to be shown later ) , to derive the quotient of even determinants @xmath115 we now use the first variation of zeilberger s ansatz ( see section  [ sec.34 ] ) to derive recurrences for the quotients @xmath116 , etc . which appear on the right - hand sides of and  . since the arguments closely follow the lines of the proof of theorem  [ thm.34 ] , we do nt detail further this part and refer to the electronic material  @xcite .",
    "although for our purposes it would suffice to work with these recurrences , we succeed in solving them in closed form : @xmath117 these quotients immediately give closed - form evaluations of the corresponding determinants ( see also theorems  [ thm.b01 ] and  [ thm.b10 ] ) .",
    "it remains to justify the assumptions @xmath110 and @xmath114 that were used to derive and  .    in order to evaluate the quotient",
    "@xmath118 we need to modify the method presented in section  [ sec.34 ] : we apply laplace expansion with respect to the first row of the matrix , instead of the @xmath9-th row , and we normalize the auxiliary function  @xmath1 in such a way that @xmath119 .",
    "if we come up with a recursive description of some function  @xmath1 and are able to verify the following identities , then we are done : @xmath120 as before , the details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "last but not least we have to argue that @xmath121 vanishes .",
    "krattenthaler kindly pointed us to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  11 ) ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  35 ) ) which contains this statement .",
    "anyway we have produced an alternative , computerized proof : actually it is very simple , since we just have to come up with a guess for the coefficients of a linear combination of the columns ( or rows ) that gives 0 , and then prove that our guess does the job .",
    "hence we find a recursive description of a function @xmath1 for @xmath8 and @xmath122 , such that @xmath123 and such that there is an index  @xmath19 for which @xmath124 . for guessing , we compute @xmath1 for all  @xmath9 up to some bound and normalize them .",
    "luckily the nullspace of the above system has always dimension  @xmath125 , otherwise it would be trickier to find a suitable linear combination ( however , in our problem this is no surprise since we are finally aiming at proving that the minor @xmath126 of this matrix evaluates to some nonzero expression ) .",
    "so we are successful in guessing the recurrences of @xmath1 and use them to prove @xmath127 this concludes the proof of theorem  [ thm.35 ] .    since the evaluations of the determinants @xmath128 and @xmath129 are interesting results in their own right , but are somehow hidden in the proof of theorem  [ thm.35 ] , we are going to state them explicitly here .",

    "analogously to ",
    ", we apply a variation of zeilberger s approach to derive a recurrence for @xmath144 the result is @xmath145 which reveals that the quotient  @xmath146 is constant .",

    "as mentioned above , lascoux found that the more general determinant @xmath149 factors completely for odd natural numbers @xmath9 and  @xmath150 , and its complicated evaluation , which was figured out by krattenthaler , appears as _ conjecture  37 _ in  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the formula given there holds only for @xmath151 ; otherwise the kronecker delta does not show up in the matrix and the evaluation is much simpler .",
    "we can not attack this determinant directly with zeilberger s ansatz since the matrix entries do not evaluate to polynomials in  @xmath30 for concrete integers @xmath23 and  @xmath19 , as long as @xmath150 is kept symbolically .",
    "therefore the guessing for @xmath1 will not work .",
    "a different strategy would consist in finding some connection between the cases @xmath150 and @xmath152 ; then induction on @xmath150 would provide a proof , using theorem  [ thm.35 ] as the base case @xmath153 .",
    "unfortunately we were not able to achieve this goal .",
    "we want to conclude our article with a challenge problem for the next generation of computer algebra tools . in section  [ sec.34 ]",

    "but so far nobody has come up with a closed form for the determinant  @xmath28 .",
    "we now present a conjectured closed form , which , however , we are unable to prove with the methods described in the present paper .",
    "we have already remarked in section  [ sec.34 ] that the quotient @xmath154 most probably is not holonomic ; in that case zeilberger s holonomic ansatz and our variations of it are not applicable .",
