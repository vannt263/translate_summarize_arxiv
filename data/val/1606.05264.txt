    "the large scale universe has a long standing problem puzzling the researchers , which is known as the accelerated expansion of the large scale universe  @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the central problems among the others .",
    "the minimal model to solve the problem is @xmath4cdm standard model of modern cosmology , where the cosmological constant plays the role of the dark energy .",
    "however , it is well known , that @xmath4cdm model poses two problems . mainly , the value of the cosmological constant estimated from the observational data compared to the value estimated from quantum field theory , is very small  ( @xmath5 order ) .",
    "even , if we change our believe to quantum field theory , we can reduce this difference up to @xmath6 , which is still very big  @xcite  ( and references therein ) .",
    "surprisingly , mentioned problem can be avoided if we consider dynamical dark energy models  @xcite  ( and references therein ) .",
    "one of the first attempts to construct the dynamical dark energy models , was the replacement of the cosmological constant via the dynamical cosmological constant .",
    "this is very interesting research direction attracting appropriate attention in literature and , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the reader can find some phenomenological forms of the varying cosmological constant model .",
    "recently , various attempts to construct new models of the varying cosmological constant has been considered too  @xcite .",
    "obtained results from the cosmographic analysis of suggested models do seem very promising . another interesting class of the dark energy candidates , could be generated using the scalar fields . among them",
    "are quintessence , phantom and quintom dark energy models  ( to mention a few and see ref .",
    "@xcite for an appropriate discussion ) . on the other hand , a special attention to the scalar field models of the dark energy",
    "is explained due to their applicability to the cosmic inflation puzzle . in history of our universe",
    "the cosmic inflation has a special place , because according to recent understanding , all required seeds to have our universe has been established namely during this accelerated expansion  @xcite  ( and references therein ) .",
    "there is an impressive amount of work , where the dark energy models with an explicitly given energy density have been involved to complete the darkness of the large scale universe . among them",
    "is the generalized ghost dark energy  ( @xmath7 corresponds to the ghost dark energy case )  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants , while @xmath11 it is the hubble parameter of the universe .",
    "recently , various phenomenological modifications of the ghost dark energy have been considered .",
    "cosmographic analysis of the models revealed their viability and applicability to the problem of the accelerated expansion of the large scale universe according to the recent observational data  @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for considered cosmological models , with the varying ghost dark energy models , describing the large scale universe , have been demonstrate massless particle creation possibility in an appropriate radiation dominated early universes  @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "this fact makes these models more attractive .",
    "more about technique behind massless particle creation in an expanding radiation dominated universe , reader can find in references of  @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "another option to represent the darkness of our universe it is the dark fluid . actively discussed models of the dark energy fluids are barotropic dark fluid , polytropic dark fluid , chaplygin gas and van der waals gas  ( with various modifications of mentioned fluids , including modifications via viscosity )  @xcite  -@xcite . very often , we can meet various modifications and parameterizations of the eos parameter of the dark fluid .",
    "a parameterization of the eos parameter of the dark fluid involving the deceleration parameter @xmath12 has been considered recently in ref  @xcite .",
    "seems that a parametrization of this kind is very natural , since origination of the dark energy in our universe will be directly related to the accelerated expansion according to such approach . moreover",
    ", the opposite statement also could be correct .",
    "another parameterization considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , is related directly to the scalar model of the dark energy .",
    "the authors , have suggested to consider a scalar field model of the dark energy described by the following energy density and pressure @xmath13 @xmath14 which is kind of a joint model of the quintessence and phantom dark energy models , if we consider @xmath15 as a dynamical function defined on @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "another interesting aspect in study of the accelerated expansion of the low redshift universe and the dark energy , it is various tools able to distinguish them among each other .",
    "one of such tools it is the statefinder analysis suggesting to study the following two parameters  @xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 it is the scale factor of universe , while @xmath12 it is the deceleration parameter defined as @xmath20 it is s geometrical tool and has been applied successfully to many cosmological models since it has been proposed .",
    "other possibilities allowing us to distinguish the dark energy models are @xmath21  @xcite , @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath1  @xcite and statefinder hierarchy analysis  @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 analysis suggests to study behavior of the dark energy in @xmath22 and @xmath23 plane , where @xmath22 it is the derivative of the eos of the dark energy with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath0 analysis suggests to study the following parameter @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath11 it is the hubble parameter and @xmath27 it is the value of the hubble parameter at @xmath28 .",
    "the three - point diagnostic @xmath1 @xmath29 where the two point @xmath0 does read as @xmath30 is developed for mentioned purpose , too . on the other hand , the statefinder hierarchy analysis requires to calculate and study the following parameters @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 etc . , where @xmath12 it is the deceleration parameter , while @xmath34 reads as @xmath35 with @xmath36 statefinder hierarchy for @xmath4cdm model during the cosmic expansion is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "however , for the models with a dynamical dark energy and dark matter , @xmath38 are varying quantities and @xmath4cdm model can be chosen as a reference frame to emphasize possible deviations .",
    "statefinder hierarchy analysis together with the growth rate study provides significantly important information about the model .",
    "therefore , there is an active research to provide a closer look to the cosmological models via last two studies , too .",
    "phase space analysis it is an elegant mathematical tool allowing to understand behavior of the low redshift universe .",
    "moreover , it allows easily to find appropriate tracker solutions and demonstrate a solution to the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "phase space analysis removes needs to solve the field equations  @xcite  ( and references therein ) . taking into account the importance of above mentioned tools , in this paper we will have a look to the cosmological models via @xmath0 and @xmath1 analysis to complete the estimation of the present day values of @xmath2 and @xmath39 parameters , when there are specific forms of the interaction between the dark energy and dark matter .",
    "we will address the next section to the details of the cosmological models defined according to general relativity and in the same section we will include an appropriate discussion on the forms of the interaction term . the lack of the fundamental theory , still leaves the questions open concerning to the form and the reasons of having an interaction inside the darkness of the large scale universe . on the other hand , available data is not enough to have appropriate statistical analysis allowing to gain more information concerning to these questions .",
    "in literature , there is an appropriate discussion on this topic and we refer the reader to the references of this work for an appropriate information  @xcite  -  @xcite and references therein . to finalize this section",
    ", we would like very briefly mention about modified theories of gravity .",
    "modified theories of gravity are attractive , since they are trying to explain the observational data providing different background dynamics to universe . if we apply modified theories of gravity , we do not need to introduce the dark energy by hand as in case of general relativity , since an appropriate modification provides an additional term in the field equations , which can be interpreted as the dark energy . in this case , the origin of the dark energy it is in the heart of the modified theory , but each modifications provides its version of the dark energy .",
    "therefore the modification of general relativity it is one step forwards towards the solutions of the large scale universe , but not the final one .",
    "this is the reason for looking for other radical ways to solve the problems  @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : intmgr ] we will present a detailed description of the suggested cosmological models containing interacting generalized holographic dark energy model with a nojiri - odintsov cut - off . in section  [ sec : intm ]",

    "<S> moreover , we assume specific forms of the interaction between these two components and besides the cosmographic analysis , we discuss appropriate results from @xmath0 and @xmath1 analysis and organize a closer look to the models via the statefinder hierarchy analysis , too . in this way we study mainly </S>",
