    "in preparing a second edition of _ time reversibility , computer simulation , and chaos_@xcite we are presently summarizing some of the recent work in this field in a pedagogical form . we would appreciate readers suggestions as to topics which ought to be included or expanded .",
    "one such topic is considered here , `` fluctuation theorems '' .    by",
    "now there is a voluminous literature devoted to fluctuation theorems of the type described first in 1993 by evans , cohen , and morriss@xcite .",
    "these theorems relate the relative probabilities of sufficiently - long forward and reversed nonequilibrium trajectory segments to the corresponding external entropy produced along the forward trajectory@xcite .",
    "the time - reversibility of deterministic thermostated motion equations simplifies such calculations .    among the simplest applications",
    "is the `` galton board '' problem , the field - driven motion of a point particle through a periodic array of hard - disk scatterers@xcite .",
    "we illustrate that application here as a worked - out pedagogical exercise problem .",
    "this problem makes contact with other areas of the research literature : periodic orbit analysis@xcite and the effects of finite precision on simulation results@xcite .",
    "we simplify the analysis by considering a phase - space distribution representing a single periodic orbit .",
    "the orbit is long enough ( millions of collisions and billions of timesteps ) to closely approximate a full nonequilibrium ensemble average .",
    "the orbit lengths used appear in table i. they are sensitive to the exact details of the trajectory calculation .",
    "related examples of the underlying galton board problem have been discussed at length in the literature@xcite .",
    "table i. number of decimal digits @xmath0 , number of collisions , number of timesteps , and collision rate @xmath1 in typical periodic orbits where each collision is centered in a phase - space cell described with a spacing of @xmath0 decimal digits .",
    "the fourth - order runge - kutta timestep is 0.0005 .",
    "the correlation dimension @xmath2 from reference 19 predicts orbit lengths of order @xmath3 for @xmath4 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "consider the longtime phase - space probability density @xmath5 generated by motion in a nonequilibrium steady state . besides the details of the time - dependent coordinates @xmath6 and momenta @xmath7 ,",
    "included also is at least one thermostat variable @xmath8 , which defines the external time - dependent entropy production rate @xmath9 required to maintain the steady state . when nos - hoover thermostats are used the friction coefficient(s ) @xmath10 are independent variables , obeying their own differential equations : @xmath11 \\ \\ } \\ .\\ ] ] and guaranteeing that the thermostated momenta included in the sum(s ) have longtime average kinetic temperature(s ) @xmath12 .    in the one - body galton board simulation problem analyzed in sections iii and",
    "iv @xmath8 is not an independent variable , but is instead an explicit linear function of the momentum , a `` gaussian thermostat '' , keeping the kinetic temperature constant : @xmath13    to simplify our analysis we consider here computational models `` solved '' by generating finite - difference approximations to their system trajectories .",
    "finite - difference schemes in bounded phase spaces eventually begin to repeat their history . estimating the number of steps both prior to and during the repetition is analogous to solving the `` birthday problem '' , `` how large must a randomly - chosen group of people be to make it likely that two share the same birthday ? '' .",
    "similarly , random jumps in an @xmath14-state phase space suggest a longest periodic orbit length of order @xmath15 jumps , a second - longest orbit shorter by a factor of @xmath16 , a third - longest orbit shorter by @xmath17 , and so on .",
    "thus in practice there are only a few ( @xmath18 ) _ periodic orbits _ in a finite - precision phase space@xcite with their combined lengths less than twice that of the longest periodic orbit . in a _",
    "situation , with a multifractal attractor having a reduced phase - space dimensionality , there are even - fewer , even - shorter paths .",
    "the details can be expressed in terms of the multifractal distribution s `` correlation dimension '' , which gives the dimensionality of nearby pairs of trajectory points@xcite .    by considering only the longest most - likely of these numerical orbits ,",
    "the resulting `` natural measure '' in the space is a constant , @xmath19 at each of the @xmath20 discrete points of the orbit and is zero elsewhere in the space . in a typical nonequilibrium",
    "steady state the length of this longest single orbit exceeds the combined lengths of all the rest in the fine - mesh limit@xcite . with double - precision arithmetic",
    "the typical mesh size is of order @xmath21 .",
    "all of the longest - orbit system variables , including @xmath22 the rate of external entropy production due to the thermostat , are necessarily periodic functions of time with period @xmath23 , the orbit length .",
    "the external entropy produced per period is a positive constant , @xmath24 .",
    "because the nonequilibrium motion equations underlying our continuous - time problem are all _ time - reversible _ , we can also usefully imagine a highly - improbable time - reversed _",
    "backward _ version of the periodic orbit .",
    "see figure 2 for a four - digit example .",
    "this `` repellor '' trajectory , the time - reversed attractor , is a bit artificial .",
    "it can be generated in either of two fully - equivalent ways : [ 1 ] solve the differential equations for @xmath25 as usual , but with a _ negative timestep _ @xmath26 or [ 2 ] take the stored solution of the equations with a positive @xmath27 and change the signs of the @xmath7 and @xmath28 . because a finite bounded phase - space distribution requires that the lyapunov instability@xcite of the reversed orbit necessarily exceeds that of the forward attractor , the reversed orbit can only be generated in the two ways just mentioned .",
    "fluctuation theorems describe the _ relative probability _ of finite - but - large _ segments _ of such forward - backward pairs .",
    "unlike the central limit theorem , which predicts the longtime ( gaussian ) _ shape _ of the probability distribution , the fluctuation theorems instead predict ratios of forward / backward probabilities . by considering the simplest computational case where the phase - space motion is periodic , but dissipative",
    ", the discussion of this single - orbit problem avoids the need to address ergodicity as well as sign changes in the values of the local ( coordinate - dependent ) lyapunov exponents .",
    "consider an observation time @xmath29 ( perhaps as small as a single timestep and possibly as large as the total length @xmath30 of the periodic orbit under consideration ) .",
    "averaging the location of the observation time over the entire orbit gives exactly the same rate of external entropy production ( due to the thermostat ) as characterizes the full orbit : @xmath31 the @xmath32 done ( by a driving external field ) , summed up over the entire orbit , is necessarily equal to the total @xmath33 extracted by the constant - temperature thermostat .",
    "dividing by the thermostat temperature @xmath34 gives the corresponding entropy produced , @xmath35 . in the special case we consider in sections iii and iv the kinetic temperature is fixed by using a `` gaussian '' thermostat .",
    "gauss _ principle of least constraint _ provides a basis for this approach .",
    "the principle suggests using the smallest possible rms force to constrain the kinetic temperature t. this `` least '' force is linear in the momentum .",
    "we define the kinetic temperature @xmath34 in the usual way : @xmath36 .",
    "fluctuation theorems with fluctuating temperatures and with stochastic thermostats have also been considered and tested@xcite .",
    "the relative probabilities of the forward `` attractor '' and reversed `` repellor '' orbits ( if we now imagine them as the two infrequently communicating parts of an ergodic steady continuous distribution ) can be expressed in terms of their orbit - averaged lyapunov exponents .",
    "the entire spectrum of lyapunov exponents , both positive and negative , can be determined using a finite - difference algorithm , as described by bennetin@xcite , or by using continuous - time lagrange multiplier constraints@xcite .",
    "the positive exponents , which describe spreading , can be used to express the loss rate of probability density from the neighborhoods of the forward and backward orbits .",
    "these loss rates for the attractor @xmath37 and repellor @xmath38 must balance in a steady state . averaged over a single periodic orbit , this balance expresses the attractor and repellor probabilities in terms of the dissipation induced by the thermostat : @xmath39 = f_r\\exp",
    "[ \\sum_{\\lambda_r > 0 } -\\lambda_r\\tau ]   \\longleftrightarrow \\frac{f_a}{f_r } = \\frac{e^{\\sum \\lambda_a\\tau } } { e^{-\\sum \\lambda_r\\tau } } = e^{\\langle \\dot s\\rangle \\tau / k } \\ .\\ ] ] because the positive exponents on the repellor are simply reversed - sign versions of the negative exponents on the attractor the two lyapunov - exponent sums can be combined : @xmath40 = \\ln \\biggl[\\frac{f_a}{f_r}\\biggr ] =   \\sum_{\\lambda_a > 0 } \\lambda_a\\tau - \\sum_{\\lambda_r > 0 } \\lambda_r\\tau \\equiv \\sum_a \\lambda \\tau = \\langle \\dot s \\rangle\\tau /k \\ . \\ \\ \\ [ ft]\\ ] ] the usual statement of this fluctuation theorem [ ft ] includes the proviso that the averaging time @xmath30 must be sufficiently large .",
    "it is evident that the steady state quotient @xmath41 is typically positive , as the second law states , so that the longtime expression @xmath42 $ ] fails as @xmath23 approaches zero .    for gauss or nos - hoover thermostats the equality between the complete sum of all the local lyapunov exponents and the external rate of entropy production is an identity . for the galton board example which we detail in section",
    "iii this equality follows directly from an application of liouville s theorem to the nonhamiltonian equations of motion suggested by gauss principle .",
    "the fluctuation theorem illustrated here was first demonstrated , numerically , for a manybody shear flow@xcite .",
    "we illustrate the same theorem in the next section for a simple pedagogical example , the thermostated one - particle galton board@xcite .",
    "we divide up a single relatively - long finite - precision periodic orbit into portions @xmath29 .",
    "evidently the overall averaged dissipation rate for these portions is the same as the rate for the entire orbit @xmath43 so that we can test the applicability of the theorem as a function of the sampling time @xmath29 .",
    "the galton board problem provides an instructive example of all these ideas . a point particle with unit mass",
    "is accelerated to the right by a field @xmath44 through a triangular lattice of fixed disk scatterers . for this problem the average current @xmath45 , dissipated energy , and entropy production",
    "are all simply related : @xmath46 the speed @xmath47 of the point particle , as well as its `` temperature '' @xmath48 , is kept constant by the friction coefficient @xmath49 : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the instantaneous external entropy production rate .",
    "the complete set of motion equations for the isokinetic galton board is the following : @xmath52 by switching to polar momentum coordinates these trajectory equations can be integrated analytically@xcite , though here we choose to use the equally accurate ( machine accuracy ) fourth - order runge - kutta integration for simplicity s sake .",
    "the hard - disk elastic force @xmath53 is the reflective interaction of the point particle and the fixed scatterer , where the collision location and direction are given by the angles @xmath54 defined in the caption of figure 2 .",
    "the collisional `` jumps '' in the phase - space orbit contribute to the lyapunov instability of the problem , but make no contribution to the work done by the field or to the heat extracted by the thermostat and converted to external entropy production .",
    "in the numerical work the coordinates and momenta are rescaled ( with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and the scatterer diameter all equal to unity ) , @xmath57 whenever the accurate runge - kutta trajectory returns @xmath58 values inside the scatterer radius of 1/2 .",
    "we apply this model to the fluctuation theorem by considering the situation indicated in figure 1 for a periodic unit cell .",
    "the figure shows an illustrative trajectory portion made up of @xmath59 timesteps , with @xmath60 . in the equilibrium case ,",
    "with zero field , the scatterer collisions make all velocity directions equally probable so that the probability density for @xmath61 diverges at @xmath62 : @xmath63 @xmath64 with the field turned `` on '' the downhill directions become more probable , as is illustrated by the trajectory segment of figure 1 and by the two probability densities , normalized for 400 momentum bins , shown in figure 3 . with the field",
    "`` off '' , and all velocity directions equally likely the probability density for @xmath65 diverges at the extrema , @xmath66 .",
    "the low - field dynamics is lyapunov unstable@xcite , with two nonzero lyapunov exponents , @xmath67 at zero field , and @xmath68 with a field strength of @xmath69 .",
    "these data for the galton board , and many others , for simple models and for manybody systems , are available in christoph dellago s 1995 dissertation@xcite .",
    "if the field strength is large enough , short periodic orbits with both exponents negative ( 20 collisions for @xmath70 and 2 collisions for @xmath71 ) can be stabilized in the infinitesimal - mesh limit .",
    "see figures 2 and 5 of reference 7 .",
    "to avoid such nonergodic situations we choose a field strength @xmath72 , for which the conductivity ( current divided by field ) is 0.0734 , significantly reduced from the lowfield@xcite green - kubo value of 0.10 , and corresponding to a current @xmath73 @xmath74 and a mean squared current of 0.574 .",
    "these latter numerical results were obtained in 1987@xcite .    the probability densities for four different sampling times",
    "are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the longest time shown corresponds to approximately 178 collision times , while the shortest is about 1/6 of a collision time .",
    "let us turn to the analysis of the sampling - time dependence of these results from the longtime standpoints of the fluctuation theorem and the central limit theorem .",
    "the `` fluctuation theorem '' expresses the ratios of probabilities of forward and reversed processes , but not their shapes , ending up with expressions like this : @xmath75_{\\delta \\tau } = \\frac{+\\sigma \\delta \\tau}{k } \\ , \\ ] ] valid in the limit that @xmath29 is sufficiently large .",
    "the central limit theorem , also valid for large @xmath76 , can be expressed similarly : @xmath75_{\\delta \\tau } = -\\frac{(+\\sigma - \\langle \\sigma \\rangle)^2}{2\\sigma^2 } + \\frac{(-\\sigma - \\langle \\sigma \\rangle)^2}{2\\sigma^2 } = + \\frac{2\\sigma \\langle \\sigma \\rangle}{\\sigma^2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where the average entropy production here is @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the `` standard deviation '' of the gaussian . equating the two expressions ( fluctuation theorem and central limit theorem ) gives an explicit large-@xmath29 expression for @xmath79 : @xmath80    a visual inspection of the current probabilities for a relatively large time averaging interval @xmath81 ( nearly 200 collisions ) reveals noticeable deviations from a smooth gaussian shape .",
    "much larger intervals are not practical because the probability of observing negative currents becomes small . for example",
    ", for a time interval of @xmath82 , where we never observed a `` negative entropy production '' in our table i sample length of @xmath83 , the probability of the zero - current gaussian relative to its maximum ( at an entropy production rate of 0.66 ) is @xmath84 = \\exp[-(0.66/4 ) \\times 100 ] = \\exp[-16.5 ] \\simeq 7\\times 10^{-8 } \\ .\\ ] ]    for this example problem it is evident that the two longtime relations are only semiquantitative ( with errors of a few percent ) and do nt give the detailed shape of the probability distribution . to illustrate the fluctuation theorem relationship in the usual way we plot the ( logarithm of the ) probability ratio for a range of sampling times , from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "the data shown in figures 5 and 6 , all for a single typical 12-digit periodic orbit , demonstrate that the fluctuation theorem , like the central limit theorem , is indeed a useful semiquantitative guide provided that the sampling time is more than a few collisions and that the entropy production rate is not too large .",
    "the fluctuation theorem provides accurate estimates for the relative probability of forward and reversed steady - state phase - space trajectories .",
    "the theorem illustrates the usefulness of coarse - grained probability densities in microscopic interpretations of macroscopic thermodynamics .",
    "results for short - term nonequilibrium fluctuations ( most of the data in figure 4 ) are highly model dependent , and still lack accurate theoretically - based estimates .",
    "the fluctuation theorem looks very much like onsager s ( or gibbs ) relation for probablities in terms of a nonequilibrium phase - space entropy , @xmath87 even though the nonequilibrium entropy does not exist@xcite outside the linear - response regime .",
    "the fluctuation theorem goes beyond the central limit theorem ( which also applies to nonequilibrium steady states ) and so can be used to give an explicit prediction for the halfwidth of the large-@xmath29 gaussian distribution : @xmath88_{ft } = \\delta \\tau\\sigma /k \\ \\simeq \\",
    "\\ln \\biggl[\\frac{{\\rm prob}(+\\sigma)}{{\\rm prob}(-\\sigma)}\\biggr]_{clt } = 2\\sigma\\langle\\sigma\\rangle/\\sigma^2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the standard deviation , and accordingly should be @xmath89 .",
    "the two theorems taken together do provide a useful semiquantitative guide to nonequilibrium fluctuations far from the linear - response regime .",
    "the relationship between the length of coarse - grained periodic orbits and the multifractal correlation dimension can be derived from a statistical viewpoint , by imagining random jumps among @xmath14 phase space states , resulting in an orbit length somewhat less than @xmath15 . in the present work",
    "the `` jump '' from one collision to the next can be viewed as such a process .",
    "many generalizations of this simple isokinetic model have been elaborated in the literature . by adding a magnetic field@xcite the time - reversibility of the equations of motion",
    "can be eliminated , but with the results still obeying the fluctuation theorem .",
    "a nos - hoover thermostat@xcite allows for fluctuations in the kinetic energy , but without affecting reversibility . in both these cases",
    "the fluctuation theorem is obeyed for sufficiently large times .",
    "results in the short - time limit , instantaneous fluctuations in the entropy production rate , are more highly model dependent and still can not be predicted theoretically .",
