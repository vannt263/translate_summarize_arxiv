    "there is evidence for magnetic fields on small upto very large scales .",
    "going beyond stars there are observations of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium of galaxies and cluster of galaxies .",
    "important tracers of galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields are diffuse synchrotron radiation and faraday rotation .",
    "synchrotron radiation is emitted by electrons spiralling around the magnetic field lines and the emissivity is determined by the energy spectrum and number density of the electrons , the frequency and the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "due to its high degree of intrinsic linear polarization the polarization of the diffuse synchrotron radiation can be used to determine the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "its degree of polarization is determined by the spectral index of the energy spectrum of the electrons .",
    "for example , in the milky way the degree of polarization in a homogeneous magnetic field is 75% @xcite",
    ". a lower degree of polarization could indicate inhomogeneities in the magnetic field or the electron distribution .",
    "the magnetic field component along the line of sight , @xmath0 , determines the faraday effect .",
    "the polarization plane of a linearly polarized wave with wave length @xmath1 passing through a magnetized medium is rotated by an angle @xmath2 where the rotation measure @xmath3 is given by the intgral over the path length , @xmath4 ( rad m@xmath5 ) where @xmath6 is the electron density @xcite . unless there is independent information about the electron energy distribution the magnetic strength",
    "is determined assuming equipartition .",
    "this means equalizing the energy densities in the magnetic field and electrons . in our own galaxy",
    "this hypothesis can be tested .",
    "it is found to be in good agreement with magnetic field estimates using independent information of cosmic ray energy distributions @xcite .",
    "zeeman splitting of spectral lines is another possibility though generally it is very limited due to the much larger line width @xcite .    over recent years",
    "methods are being developed to detect truly cosmologically magnetic fields , not associated with any virialized structure .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of some tev blazars in the tev and gev range hint at the presence of a cosmological magnetic field pervading all space @xcite .",
    "tev blazars are a type of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) which produce @xmath7 ray photons in the tev energy range .",
    "these photons can not travel very far from the source since they interact with the extragalactic background light producing electron positron pairs .",
    "these particles interact with the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) via inverse compton effect thereby emitting secondary photons in the gev energy range .",
    "thus an electromagnetic cascade takes place .",
    "the trajectories of the electrons and positrons in this cascade are deflected if the cascade takes place in a magnetized medium .",
    "this could then lead to time - delayed observation of the gev signal , the detection of an extended emission of an initially point - like source or the absence of power in the gev part of the energy spectrum of the source since the charged particles have been deflected out of our line of sight .",
    "observations of any of these effects imply a lower bound on any cosmologically magnetic field .",
    "an interesting example is the tev blazar 1es0229 + 200 . from the observations of hess and veritas telescopes indicate no significant time variability in the tev energy flux over the time scale of observation of 3 yr .",
    "the corresponding fermi / lat data of this source show a lack of power in the gev energy range . depending on the particular model of the geometry and parameters of the electromagnetic cascades the lower limit of the intergalactic magnetic field",
    "is estimated to be larger than @xmath8 g @xcite or @xmath9 g @xcite .",
    "agns are thought to produce cosmic rays , in particular protons .",
    "these interact with the cmb photons as well as the ebl photons and produce secondary high energy photons at energies above tev @xcite . including the cosmic ray contribution solves certain puzzles with the tev data such as lack of time correlations and leads to a limit of @xmath10 g @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields play an important role in the physics of star formation as they allow to reduce angular momentum of the protostellar cloud during collapse .",
    "moreover , the magnetic pressure acts against gravitational collapse .",
    "thus the presence of magnetic fields has an important effect on the distribution of stellar masses as well as density perturbations which will be discussed in more detail in section [ sect3 ] .    in general magnetic fields in spiral galaxies",
    "have a regular component and a random component .",
    "depending on the location within the galaxy the regular or the random component can be dominant .",
    "typically the field strength of the regular component in spiral galaxies is of the order 1 - 5 @xmath11 g @xcite .",
    "there are examples of galaxies with much stronger regular magnetic fields of upto 15 @xmath11 g such as in the interarm region of ngc 6946 @xcite . in general , the magnetic field in the spiral arms",
    "is dominated by the random component which is due to star formation and expansion of supernovae remnants leading to turbulence in the interstellar medium , thereby entangling the magnetic field lines .",
    "the total magnetic field strengths , including the regular and random components , is on average of the order of 9 @xmath11 g , however , it in the prominent spiral arms of m51 it is of the order of 30 - 35 @xmath11 g @xcite .    over recent years",
    "the number of faraday rotation measures @xmath3 to estimate the magnetic field in our own galaxy has increased significantly thanks to , e.g. , the national radio astronomy observatory vla sky survey ( nvss ) of polarized radio sources . in @xcite 37543 @xmath3s have been derived .",
    "the galactic magnetic field has three different components , namely , the central region , the halo and the disk . the galactic halo magnetic field in the solar neighbourhood",
    "is found to be of the order of @xmath12 @xmath11 g .",
    "the central region is associated with a highly regular magnetic field of strength upto milligauss concentrated in filaments @xcite .",
    "the local regular disk magnetic field is @xmath13 @xmath11 g and the total magnetic field strength @xmath14 @xmath11 g @xcite .",
    "multiple field reversals are observed in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "this is rather unusual and has not been observed in other spiral galaxies .",
    "however , it might actually be the result of us observing from within the galaxy , meaning that observations trace different volumes , or due to large - scale anisotropic field loops @xcite .",
    "observations of clusters of galaxies indicate magnetic fields of the order @xmath11 g .",
    "faraday rotation measurements of the coma cluster yield a field strength of 2 @xmath11 g @xcite .",
    "the structure of the magnetic field depends on the type of cluster .",
    "the random component is of the order of @xmath11 g for non - cooing flow clusters , such as the coma cluster with larger correlation length ( 10 - 30 kpc ) and can reach several @xmath11 g for cooling flow clusters such as the hydra a cluster and shorter correlation lengths @xcite .",
    "there are also observations of magnetic fields associated with high redshift galaxies .",
    "in particular in @xcite faraday rotation measures of 268 quasars and radio galaxies upto a redshift @xmath15 were determined .",
    "it was found that these objects are endowed with @xmath11g - level magnetic fields indicating that they were generated very quickly at early cosmological epochs .",
    "the wealth of observations of magnetic fields in the universe naturally leads to the question of their origin .",
    "clearly the presence of magnetic fields in high redshift objects puts their time of generation long before the present epoch .",
    "indications of void magnetic fields not associated with any gravitationally bound structures add a novel aspect since in this case the generation mechanism can not rely directly on , say , amplification mechanisms during gravitational collapse or dynamo mechanisms .    for galactic magnetic fields",
    ", it is generally assumed that a galactic dynamo is operating thereby amplifying an initial seed field .",
    "depending on the efficiency of the dynamo the magnetic seed field can be as small as @xmath16 g @xcite . taking into account the contribution of dark energy observed in our universe",
    "significantly relaxes the lower bound on the field strength to explain the present day galactic magnetic field of @xmath11g - level , lowering it to @xmath17 g @xcite .",
    "the standard mechanism is the @xmath18 mean field dynamo theory .",
    "the key equation is @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the resistivity of the plasma .",
    "@xmath21 can be approximated by @xmath22 so that the last term can be written in terms of a decay time @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "it turns out that in the galaxy the last term can be neglected since for a typical gas temperature of @xmath25 k the resistive term @xmath26",
    "@xmath27s@xmath28 @xcite implies a decay time of @xmath29 years where @xmath30 is the correlation length of the magnetic field . neglecting the resistivity term in equation ( [ e1 ] ) the mean field @xmath31-@xmath32 dynamo is determined by splitting the velocity as well as the magnetic field in a mean part , indicated by an index 0 , and a random part , indicated by a @xmath33 .",
    "ensemble averaging over the fluctuations yields to @xcite @xmath34 solving the corresponding evolution equation for the magnetic field fluctuation @xmath35 in terms of the turbulent velocity @xmath36 in the quasilinear expansion leads to @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the correlation time .",
    "hence @xmath31 is determined by the kinetic helicity of the random velocity field . @xmath40 which determines the diffusion which smoothes out the turbulent magnetic field component @xcite .",
    "finally the mean field dynamo equation reads @xcite @xmath41 applied to the galactic disk it is appropriate to use cylindrical coordinates and the mean velocity is expressed in terms of the galactic rotation .",
    "the key ingredients for the mean field dynamo to work are differential rotation of the galaxy ( @xmath32 ) and turbulent motion ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "there are certain problems with the @xmath31-@xmath32 mean field dynamo such as achieving enough turbulence and hence amplification , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the problem of cluster magnetic fields is still much less understood than that of galactic magnetic fields . as mentioned above clusters of galaxies",
    "are endowed with magnetic fields at @xmath11g - level and coherence lengths of order 10 kpc .",
    "the source of the cluster magnetic fields could be , for example , outflows from active galaxies thereby transporting bubbles of magnetized plasma into the intergalactic medium . though this could only act as seed fields for the cluster fields and",
    "would need further amplification .",
    "however , in this case the @xmath31-@xmath32 mean field dynamo does not work since galaxy clusters are found to have only very weak rotation .",
    "small scale turbulent dynamo action is a possibility though the origin of turbulence in clusters is still not resolved @xcite .",
    "all dynamo mechanisms have in common the need for an initial seed magnetic field . broadly speaking there are two different classes of generation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "one class of models puts the generation of large scale magnetic fields in the very early universe during inflation .",
    "similarly as density perturbations , which seed large scale structure formation , are generated starting with quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field and subsequent amplification on super horizon scales , magnetic fields are generated by amplification of perturbations in the electromagnetic field .",
    "first proposed in @xcite it was immediately clear that within standard electrodynamics the field strength of the generated magnetic fields falls short of the required minimal magnetic field @xmath42 g , and even the less stringent bound in the presence of a cosmological constant , in order to seed the galactic dynamo .",
    "it is common to use the ratio of magnetic field energy density over photon energy density @xmath43 since for a frozen - in magnetic field @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the scale factor .",
    "since the photon energy density has the same scaling with @xmath45 , @xmath46 is a constant in this case . @xmath47",
    "g corresponds to @xmath48 and @xmath49 g to @xmath50 . for a stochastic magnetic field @xmath46",
    "is calculated using the energy density stored in the mode with comoving wave number @xmath51 , that is @xmath52 .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the energy density stored in the mode with comoving wave length @xmath1 is of the order of the energy density in a thermal bath at the gibbons - hawking temperature of de sitter space.thus at first horizon crossing the magnetic energy density is given by @xmath53 where the constant energy density during inflation is given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the scale factor at the time when the comoving length scale @xmath1 was crossing the horizon during inflation .",
    "@xmath56 is the planck mass . at the end of inflation",
    "this implies @xmath57 thus at a galactic scale , @xmath58 mpc , and typical values for @xmath59 and the reheat temperature @xmath60 , say @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 gev , @xmath46 is of the order of @xmath63 which is much below the required minimal value even in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , in the case of a flat background , it is necessary to go beyond the standard model .",
    "the key point is to effectively change the amplification on superhorizon scales .",
    "there are different possibilities of modifying the standard four dimensional electromagnetic lagrangian such as coupling to curvature terms , coupling to a scalar field or extra dimensions .",
    "there are models for which cosmologically relevant magnetic fields can be generated during inflation , for an extensive review see @xcite .",
    "for open universes standard electrodynamics is sufficient @xcite ( see however @xcite ) . in general ,",
    "the correlation length is not a problem for magnetic fields generated during inflation but rather the field strength .",
    "this is exactly the opposite in the second class of generation mechanisms of large scale magnetic field . for this type of models magnetic fields",
    "are generated after inflation during some phase transition such as the electroweak or qcd phase transition .",
    "the underlying idea is charge separation as in a battery mechanism .",
    "magnetic fields generated in phase transitions have non vanishing magnetic helicity enabling inverse cascade processes .",
    "the correlation lengths of magnetic fields generated , e.g. , during the electroweak phase transitions would have correlation lengths of the order of 1 au .",
    "however , this could be increased by inverse cascade transferring power from smaller to larger scales ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic fields are determined by their energy density and pressure as well their anisotropic stress .",
    "these are additional contributions that have to be taken into account when describing the evolution of the perturbations in the primordial plasma which later on in the evolution of the universe provide the inhomogeneities in the gravitational potential necessary for galaxy formation and large scale structure in general .",
    "moreover , magnetic fields also change the evolution of the baryon velocity due to the contribution of the lorentz force term .",
    "long before recombination electrons and baryons are tightly coupled with the photons due to thomson scattering of photons off free electrons .",
    "thus long before decoupling the lorentz term also effects the evolution of the photons .",
    "all of this leads to important effects of primordial magnetic fields present before decoupling on the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies and polarization of the cosmic microwave background as well as the matter power spectrum @xcite-@xcite .",
    "observations exclude the presence of any homogeneous magnetic field on large scales of present day field strength larger than @xmath64 g @xcite . therefore assuming a gaussian random field it is completely determined by its two point function , in fourier space , ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the power spectrum of the symmetric part related to the magnetic energy density",
    ", @xmath67 is the power spectrum of the asymmetric part related to the magnetic helicity and a hat indicates a unit vector .",
    "typically , for these power spectra a power law is assumed .",
    "moreover , since magnetic fields suffer viscous damping before decoupling @xcite there is a upper cut - off @xmath68 .",
    "in addition to the parity even modes helical magnetic fields induce odd parity modes in the cmb such as cross correlations between the e and b polarization , as well as between temperature and the polarization b mode @xcite . using data from the cmb experiments wmap , quad and acbar @xcite put an upper limit on a non helical magnetic field of 6.4 ng at a scale of 1 mpc .",
    "there is a characteristic signature of magnetic fields in the linear matter power spectrum at small scales .",
    "the origin is in the lorentz term in the baryon velocity equation which leads to the evolution of the total matter perturbation @xmath69",
    "@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the magnetic energy density in terms of the the photon energy density and @xmath73 is the lorentz term where @xmath74 is the magnetic anisotropic stress . during matter domination on small scales",
    "the resulting linear matter power spectrum is then behaves as @xmath75",
    ". therefore the magnetic field adds power on small scales which is absent in the standard @xmath76cdm model without a magnetic field .",
    "there is observational evidence for large scale magnetic fields in the universe on a large range of scales . over decades",
    ", there has been a multitude of detections of magnetic fields in galaxies , including our own milky way , and cluster of galaxies .",
    "these are typically in the range of @xmath11 g . in recent years observations of tev blazars point towards the presence of a truly cosmologically ,",
    "that is , void magnetic field in the femto gauss range .",
    "observations of the cmb put an upper limit in the ng range .",
    "it is generally assumed that a dynamo mechanism amplifies an initial seed magnetic field to the present day @xmath11 g level .",
    "the origin of the initial seed magnetic field is still an open problem .",
    "there is a range of proposed mechanisms taking place during inflation in the very early universe . in a flat universe",
    "it requires breaking conformal invariance of standard electrodynamics .",
    "the problem here is to achieve strong enough magnetic fields but the correlation length is not a problem . on the contrary",
    ", magnetic fields generated after inflation , during a phase transition can be very strong however their correlation length is very small since it is limited by the horizon size at the time of generation .",
    "this problem could be alleviated by using inverse cascade operating due to the helical nature of the fields .",
    "magnetic fields present before decoupling have an influence on the cmb as well as the matter power spectrum which will offer new possibilities of constraining a truly cosmological magnetic with future experiments .",
