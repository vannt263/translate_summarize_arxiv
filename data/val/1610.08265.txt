    "gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , standard model(sm ) etc . at finite temperatures are relevant for describing the phase transitions in the early universe and in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the pure gauge parts of these theories undergo the confinement - deconfinement ( cd ) transition  @xcite at high temperatures .",
    "the corresponding pure gauge euclidean actions are invariant under a class of gauge transformations represented by the center @xmath6 of the @xmath7 group .",
    "this @xmath6 symmetry  @xcite plays an important role in the cd transition . in many ways ,",
    "the nature of the cd transition is found to be similar to the transition in spin systems with @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the deconfined phase by a non - zero thermal expectation value of the polyakov loop .",
    "this leads to @xmath8 degenerate phases in the deconfined state .    in the fundamental representation",
    ", it is believed that the @xmath6 symmetry is explicitly broken in the presence of the matter fields .",
    "this explicit breaking affects the nature of the cd transition and the thermodynamic behavior of the phases themselves .",
    "it weakens the cd transition and , in the deconfined phase , all but only one of the @xmath8 phases become meta - stable .",
    "the explicit breaking vanishes when the matter fields are infinitely heavy .",
    "so it is expected that the explicit @xmath6 symmetry breaking is small for large dynamical masses of the matter fields . in the mean field approximation of qcd ,",
    "the explicit symmetry breaking turns out to be an effective `` uniform '' external field acting on the polyakov loop  @xcite when the fermion masses are large .",
    "the strength of the external field grows as the masses decrease .",
    "non - perturbative lattice studies find that the cd transition becomes weaker with the decrease in the fermion masses in the large mass region  @xcite consistent with the findings of the mean field approximation .",
    "however , an extrapolation of this effective external field to the chiral limit fails to explain the nature of the cd transition and the polyakov loop behavior . in this case",
    ", the nature of the cd transition turns out to be the same as the chiral transition  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , in the chiral limit , the effective external field is a fluctuating and non - uniform dynamical field instead of a fixed uniform field .",
    "it is expected that the explicit breaking of @xmath6 due to bosonic matter fields also depends on mass .",
    "perturbative calculations show that the explicit symmetry breaking increases with decrease in mass in presence of fermionic matter fields  @xcite",
    ". a straightforward extension of these 1-loop calculations for bosonic fields gives similar results .",
    "for the massless case , the explicit symmetry breaking for @xmath9 is so large that there are no meta - stable states in the deconfined phase .",
    "these calculations , however , are not reliable near the cd transition . hence , non - perturbative studies of the effects of the matter fields near the cd transition are required . for heavy higgs fields ,",
    "non - perturbative calculations find that above the cd transition point the temperature dependence of the polyakov loop expectation value shows critical behavior , i.e @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "recent study of the @xmath6 symmetry  @xcite shows that the strength of the explicit symmetry breaking vanishes even for a large but finite higgs mass .",
    "these results indicate clear deviations from those of perturbative calculations in presence of matter fields .",
    "it is not clear whether the conventional expectation that the transition becomes weaker with the mass of matter fields , which is observed in qcd , also holds in the case of @xmath11higgs . to address this issue , we study the cd transition in the presence of massless higgs using non - perturbative monte carlo simulations . we also compare the non - perturbative and perturbative results away from cd transition . to simplify our study",
    ", we consider @xmath9 and vanishing higgs quartic coupling .    from lattice simulations",
    ", it is known that the thermal average of the polyakov loop  @xcite has strong cut - off dependence .",
    "the polyakov loop expectation value decreases with the number of temporal cites ( @xmath1 ) of the euclidean lattice .",
    "however , the nature of the pure gauge cd transition does not depend on @xmath1  @xcite . in the presence of massless higgs ,",
    "this transition is found to be dependent on @xmath1 . in this study , we find that this transition is a cross - over for @xmath2 and second order for @xmath4 .",
    "these results suggest that in the continuum limit the cd transition is second order .",
    "we also look at the distribution of the polyakov loop values in the thermal ensemble .",
    "the distribution in the case of @xmath4 clearly exhibits the @xmath5 symmetry , which also explains why the cd transition is second order .",
    "this is surprising as one would expect maximal symmetry breaking as is observed in perturbative calculations  @xcite as well as in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "coincidentally the realization of the @xmath12 symmetry occurs only when the system is in the higgs symmetric phase .",
    "this suggests that the strength of the higgs condensate may be playing the role of the effective external field for the cd transition .",

    "@xmath5 flip of the gauge fields are always accompanied by `` realignment '' ( @xmath97 ) of the higgs configuration .",
    "as soon as the higgs fluctuations are frozen / fixed , the explicit breaking of @xmath5 reappears .",
    "the reason why the @xmath5 realization happens for @xmath4 and not for @xmath59 and @xmath57 is the increase in the phase space of @xmath30 field with @xmath1 . with the increase in the phase space , it is more likely that for a given @xmath30 there exists a @xmath39 which can compensate for the increase in action due to @xmath5 rotation of the gauge fields .",
    "we find that the likelihood of finding such a @xmath39 increases with @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath5 symmetry in our simulations only implies that a @xmath39 exists for every statistically significant @xmath30 .",
    "it is obvious that there will be @xmath30 configurations for which there wo nt be any @xmath39 even in the limit @xmath98 .",
    "this is expected to happen when the higgs field acquires a condensate . in this sense ,",
    "the restoration / realization of the @xmath5 symmetry is not exact , and the explicit symmetry breaking is not zero but statistically insignificant .",
    "our results may have important implications for the study of @xmath6 symmetry in the presence of matter fields .",
    "conventionally , it is expected that in the massless limit there will be maximal breaking of the @xmath5 symmetry and the cd transition will be a crossover . @xmath99-loop",
    "perturbative calculations  @xcite for fermions suggest that the explicit breaking for the massless case will be so large that there will be no meta - stable states in the entire deconfinement phase . a straightforward extension for bosonic fields gives similar results . however , our non - perturbative results suggest that the explicit breaking is so minimal that meta - stable states tend become degenerate with the stable state in the continuum",
