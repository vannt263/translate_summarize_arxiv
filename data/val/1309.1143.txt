    "majorana fermionic states , first introduced in 1937 by e. majorana @xcite as real solutions of the dirac equation , have recently generated a lot of interest in condensed matter physics because of their exotic properties @xcite . unlike the usual dirac particles , the majorana fermions obey non - abelian statistics , which open the perspective of their use in topological quantum computation @xcite . their existence has been predicted in various systems : fractional quantum hall systems @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , optical lattices@xcite , p - wave superconductors @xcite , insulating @xcite and semiconducting nanowires with strong spin - orbit coupling such as inas or insb @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the latter are expected to exhibit end majorana fermionic states in the presence of an applied zeeman field and in the proximity of an s - wave superconductor ( sc ) .",
    "a topological nanowire can be modeled as a one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding chain , for which majorana fermions can form in certain regimes of parameters @xcite .",
    "besides , several studies of various two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems have pointed out the possibility to generate majorana fermions inside a vortex core as a consequence of symmetry breaking , e.g. due to the presence of an impurity , as well as diffusive majorana edge states @xcite .",
    "however , most of these studies rely on square - lattice models . the study of majorana fermions in a honeycomb lattice , like that of graphene , has received less attention @xcite .",
    "the most known and studied material exhibiting a honeycomb - lattice structure is graphene ; this is one of the most intriguing materials discovered during the last decade @xcite .",
    "its elementary excitations are dirac fermions , massless relativistic particles described by a 2d dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the exotic properties of graphene led to an extensive theoretical and experimental study focusing on both monolayer and bilayer graphene , and taking into account features such as straining and curvature , disorder , etc .",
    "( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility to get majorana fermionic states in honeycomb - lattice structures is the main topic of this paper . in particular , we focus on a nanoribbon ( nr ) with zigzag edges .",
    "the properties of such ribbon can be described by mapping it to a one - dimensional dimer chain model .",
    "taking inspiration from the analysis of a 1d wire @xcite , for which the majorana physics is well understood , we study the possibility of emergence of majorana fermions when the nr is brought in the vicinity of an s - wave superconducting substrate , in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling and of an in - plane zeeman field .",
    "in particular , at @xmath0 , and for a specific value of anisotropy corresponding to the merging of the two dirac cones @xcite , the dimer chain is exactly mapped onto a simple one - dimensional monomer chain describing a topological nanowire , for which the majorana physics has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "thus , in this limit , we can predict exactly the parameter regimes that support the existence of majorana fermions in the anisotropic nr .    we show that majorana fermionic edge states can form in various other situations , for both anisotropic and isotropic lattices , and we provide some examples of such situations .",
    "we test that these zero - energy states are indeed majoranas by using a tight - binding model and an exact diagonalization numerical technique which allows us to evaluate their wave - functions and calculate the majorana polarization introduced in refs .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the tight - binding model of the honeycomb lattice , we introduce the hamiltonians of the extra physical processes that may yield to the formation of majorana fermions , the rashba spin - orbit coupling , the zeeman field , and the s - wave superconductivity , and we describe the corresponding band structure for an infinite system . in section iii we consider finite size nanoribbons and we study the conditions for the emergence of majorana edge states in these systems .",
    "section iii a describes the mapping of a two - dimensional zigzag nr onto a one - dimensional dimer chain .",
    "section iii b is devoted to the particular value of anisotropy for which the dimer chain becomes a simple one - dimensional monomer chain , and the system can be solved exactly . in section iii c",
    "we provide examples of forming majorana fermions in an isotropic nr with zigzag edges .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "we first review the band structure of the honeycomb lattice . let us denote @xmath1 and @xmath2 the basis vectors that span the triangular bravais lattice . the interatomic distance @xmath3 , which for graphene is 0.142 nm , is taken to be @xmath4 in what follows . in this basis , each unit cell is described by a pair of integers @xmath5 , or equivalently by @xmath6 , and contains two inequivalent atoms , labeled a and b , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ honeycomblattice ] .",
    "the bulk band structure of a honeycomb lattice is well described using a tight - binding approach in which each electron may hop between two sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 with a given amplitude @xmath9 . in this work",
    "only nearest neighbor hopping processes are considered , with fixed amplitudes @xmath10 and a variable amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding second - quantized hamiltonian in real space is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the nearest neighbor atoms , @xmath14 is the chemical potential , and @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) annihilates an electron with spin @xmath17 on an atom a ( resp .",
    "b ) in the unit cell defined by @xmath18 .    the corresponding energy spectrum is presented in fig .",
    "[ bulk spectra ] for two particular values of the hopping amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath19 , two inequivalent fermi points lie at the corners of the brillouin zone , and the dispersion relation around these points is conical ( the red areas in the figure ) . for the peculiar value @xmath20 , these dirac fermions merge into a single time - reversal invariant point where the dispersion remains linear along the y - axis , whereas it becomes quadratic along the x - axis@xcite .",
    "although these fermions are responsible for the peculiar properties , such as edge states and a different type of quantum hall effect , in what follows we focus mainly on the dispersion around the zero momentum ( the blue region in fig .",
    "[ bulk spectra ] ) , as it is this region of momentum space which controls the formation of majorana fermions .",
    "@xmath21 { fig2a }     \\includegraphics[trim = 7 mm 5 mm 25 mm 20 mm , clip , width=4.3cm]{fig2b}\\\\ \\end{array}$ ]      as shown in previous works @xcite , majorana fermions appear at the boundaries of topological superconductors . in order to study their emergence in honeycomb - lattice structures ,",
    "we consider processes similar to those proposed to form majoranas in a one - dimensional monomer chain @xcite , i.e. applying a zeeman field to a system with strong spin - orbit interaction and in the vicinity of an s - wave superconductor .    in the most well - known hexagonal - lattice system ,",
    "graphene , while the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) is naturally present , its strength is very weak @xcite . that can be enhanced by different methods , _",
    "e.g. _ applying a perpendicular electric field @xcite or a non - uniform magnetic field @xcite , tuning the local curvature of the sheet @xcite , or doping by 3d or 5d transition metal adatoms @xcite .",
    "the rashba soi hamiltonian can be written as @xmath22 where the rashba spin orbit - coupling of strength @xmath23 tends to align the spins in a direction defined by the nearest neighbor vectors @xmath24 .",
    "the vector @xmath25 describes the spin pauli matrices and @xmath26 is an out - of - plane unit vector .",
    "the s - wave superconductivity is induced in the system by proximity effect and is described by a uniform on - site superconducting order parameter @xmath27 whose hamiltonian can be written as @xmath28    finally , a magnetic field @xmath29 is introduced , resulting in an out - of - plane zeeman potential @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the land g - factor and @xmath32 the bohr magneton .",
    "this zeeman hamiltonian is described as follows @xmath33      the electronic structure of an infinite honeycomb lattice in the presence of these processes can be a good starting point to predict in what circumstances majorana fermions may form in a nanoribbon .",
    "the bulk band structure of the complete system is presented in fig .",
    "[ ky - spectrum ] for two sets of parameter values .",
    "one important ingredient is the chemical potential which we take to be of the order of the bandwidth , @xmath34 .",
    "this choice will be justified rigorously in the next section .",
    "here we only note that , under these circumstances , each energy band is ellipsoidal in the vicinity of @xmath35 , such that the gap closing occurs at this zero momentum in the spectrum and is given by the condition @xmath36 for instance , the dispersion relation depicted in fig .",
    "[ ky - spectrum ] exhibits zero - energy band crossings if @xmath37 . for such values of parameters ,",
    "one expects that the introduction of edges in the system will give rise to new states inside the gap that do not correspond to any of the bands in the bulk spectrum . on the contrary , the dispersion relation plotted in fig .",
    "[ ky - spectrum ] for @xmath38 exhibits no band inversion at zero energy , and consequently no extra states besides the bulk states are expected to show up by the introduction of edges .",
    "we conjecture that this is a general feature of this model if the rashba soi is sufficiently small not to affect the band inversion mechanism . as we show in what follows , these new states are actually majorana edge states .",
    "thus , the infinite - system band structure provides us with a good starting point to search for majorana fermions in a finite size nanoribbon .",
    "@xmath39{fig3b.pdf}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=7cm]{fig3a.pdf}\\\\ \\end{array}$ ]",
    "we now introduce edges to the honeycomb - lattice structure and describe the resulting ribbon as a 1d chain of @xmath40 dimers .",
    "the system is constructed as follows : iterating periodically the ab dimer pattern ( presented in fig .",
    "[ honeycomblattice ] ) @xmath40 times along the @xmath41-direction leads to a chain of @xmath40 dimers , which is then infinitely repeated along the @xmath42-direction .",
    "the ribbon has two zigzag edges , one made of a atoms only , and the opposite made of b atoms exclusively . assuming a tight - binding model with only nearest neighbor hopping , and with an intra - dimer hopping parameter which depends on the momentum component parallel to the edges , the second quantized total hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath43\\notag \\\\               & + t_ka^{\\dagger}_{\\sigma}(k , n)b_{\\sigma}(k , n ) + t_3a^{\\dagger}_{\\sigma}(k , n)b_{\\sigma}(k , n-1)\\notag \\\\               & + i\\big[\\lambda^{\\sigma}_{k } a^{\\dagger}_{\\sigma}(k , n)b_{-\\sigma}(k , n)+\\lambda^{\\sigma }        a^{\\dagger}_{\\sigma}(k , n)b_{-\\sigma}(k , n-1)\\big ]",

    "thus , the initial 2d system is described as a 1d chain of n dimers , for each value of @xmath48 ( see fig .",

    "( respectively in the opposite direction ) .",
    "the direct connection between two identical atoms with opposite spin is given by the on - site pairing potential @xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 represents the k - dependent hopping amplitude inside a dimer , while @xmath11 labels the hopping amplitude between dimers .",

    "for the one - dimensional finite - size system at @xmath52 ( which corresponds to @xmath53 for the nr ) it has been shown that a zero - energy pair of end majorana states forms for @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the existence of majorana states in the two - dimensional anisotropic nanoribbon should be controlled by the same criterion .",

    "[ bandstructuresisotropicbis ] .",
    "while not shown here , majorana dispersive states form for the same parameter values also if the ribbon has armchair edges .",

    "first , we consider a single impurity in the nanoribbon , we model the impurity as an on - site shift of the chemical potential .",
    "the impurity acts as an island on which the topological condition is violated . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ majoranapolarizationdisorder ] , a localized impurity state forms in the vicinity of the impurity , exhibiting a dipole majorana - polarization structure .",
    "a similar structure has been observed in the presence of disorder in one - dimensional wires @xcite .",
    "@xmath70{fig9a.pdf } \\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{fig9b.pdf } \\end{array}$ ]    however , we show that the edge structure is not affected by this type of bulk disorder .",
    "we have checked that the integral of the majorana polarization is conserved and equal to one in this situation , same as in the absence of the impurity .",
    "thus we expect that the majorana modes that we found are stable with respect to bulk disorder .",
    "then , we consider a ribbon with irregular edges , as presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ majoranapolarizationdisorder ] .",
    "same as in the previous case , the irregularity is modeled with the help of a fluctuating chemical potential .",
    "we find that the majorana modes are stable also with respect to this kind of disorder .",
    "the majorana polarization shows how the formation of the majorana mode along the edges of the ribbon is independent of the local armchair or zig - zag nature of the edge .",
    "we have checked that the integral of the majorana polarization is indeed conserved in this situation .",
    "we have studied the possibility to form majorana edge states in isotropic and anisotropic nanoribbons in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling , a zeeman field and in the proximity of an s - wave superconductor .",
    "we have described a mapping between a zigzag nr and a one - dimensional dimer chain .",
    "this reduces to a 1d chain of monomers for a particular value of anisotropy for which the two dirac cones merge into a single one . in this limit",
    "we can thus describe exactly the conditions to obtain majorana fermionic states .",
    "we have tested numerically the formation of majorana states by using a tight - binding model and an exact diagonalization technique , as well as the majorana polarization .",
    "we have provided a few examples for the formation of majorana fermionic states in both isotropic and anisotropic honeycomb lattice structures with zigzag and armchair edges .",
    "our analysis shows that for rashba spin - orbit couplings of the order of @xmath71 and for a doping corresponding to @xmath69 , majorana fermions can form in isotropic nanoribbons .",
    "it remains to be seen if , and for which systems , large enough dopings and spin - orbit couplings can be achieved experimentally to attain the regime of formation for the majorana fermions . achieving",
    "the corresponding spin - orbit coupling value in graphene for example does not seem to be an insurmountable barrier .",
    "we have shown that any small but finite value for the rashba spin - orbit coupling would suffice to form majorana states ; moreover it has been proposed that rashba couplings of the order of @xmath72ev can be induced in graphene using adatoms@xcite . on the other hand",
    "it would be hard to dope graphene to chemical potentials of order @xmath67 , such dopings may be eventually achievable in the future in other systems such as cold - atom hexagonal - lattice structures .",
    "our work also opens the perspective to look for other spin - orbit or magnetic mechanisms that can also be envisaged to give rise to majorana states in two - dimensional honeycomb - lattice structures .",
