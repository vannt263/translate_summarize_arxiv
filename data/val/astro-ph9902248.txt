    "cosmologists interested in the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) must observe from within the milky way .",
    "thus , they must measure and subtract foreground emissions from the milky way .",
    "three important components of foreground emission have long been recognized : 1 ) thermal emission from dust , 2 ) synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated by magnetic fields , and 3 ) bremsstrahlung ( `` braking '' radiation or `` free - free '' emission ) from free electrons accelerated by interactions with ions in a plasma .",
    "a fourth component associated with rotating dust has also been proposed recently ( draine & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "this review addresses the galactic free - free emission and its tracer h@xmath0  light .",
    "it treats the warm ionized medium ( wim ) as an unavoidable foreground that must be accounted for in the interpretation of microwave observations of the cmb .",
    "that is , it treats the wim phenomenologically and does not discuss why the wim is the way it is .    from that viewpoint ,",
    "the problem with free - free radiation is two - fold .",
    "first , whereas at low frequencies ( @xmath1  ghz ) synchrotron emission dominates , and at high frequencies ( @xmath2  ghz ) dust emission dominates , in between ( @xmath3  ghz ) free - free emission is as bright or brighter than the other two .",
    "that is , we have leverage on synchrotron and dust , but not free - free .",
    "we need a tracer of free - free to solve the first problem ( lack of leverage ) , and that tracer is h@xmath0  light",
    ". the second problem has been  until very recently  the lack of all - sky observations of h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0  data that solve the second problem now exist and are being calibrated and rendered into a template suitable for decontaminating the free - free foreground .",
    "this review is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is a short historical vignette to give context to modern efforts .",
    "section 3 lists other reviews similar to this one .",
    "section 4 relates h@xmath0 and free - free emissions in equation 4 , figure 1 , and table 1 .",
    "section 5 describes and compares the two principle techniques for observing h@xmath0 , fabry - perot spectroscopy and narrowband imaging .",
    "typical results are shown and inherent challenges are noted .",
    "section 6 addresses the association of dust and ionized gas .",
    "finally , section 7 concludes with a short summary of how the h@xmath0  data will be used in practice to decontaminate the microwave observations .",
    "it is interesting to compare today s remote and robotic  observing in section 5 with heroic efforts from a century ago .",
    "e. e. barnard claims to have seen _ with his own eye _ that which we now call `` interstellar cirrus . ''",
    "he photographed filaments of dust in the taurus region , far from the bright reflection nebulosity of the pleiades , and remarked `` it was the knowledge of their existence by visual observations alone that led me to make the photographs '' ( barnard 1896 ) .",
    "for one such photograph , a 10-hour exposure , barnard kept the plate in the camera for over fifty hours .",
    "unsatisfied with the duration of the exposure at the end of the first night , he waited for a second night , but it was cloudy , so he resumed the exposure the third night , after re - aligning the guide star to its original location .",
    "barnard s photographs of the filaments streaming away from the pleiades look astonishingly like the 100  image of iras ( cf .",
    "plate 10 of barnard ( 1900 ) or plate 8 of barnard ( 1928 ) , which is in arny ( 1989 ) , to the iras image of souras ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "those same filaments absorb background h@xmath0 ( figure 5 ) , which is unusual at moderate galactic latitudes and contrary to the positive correlation between h@xmath0 and dust discussed in section 6 .    the h@xmath0 line is included in the pass band for the red plates of the national geographic society / palomar observatory sky survey ( poss 1 ) , and these show very bright emission nebulae . because they lack the sensitivity to detect the low - surface - brightness wim , the poss plates can give a false impression that ionized gas exists only in stromgren spheres , when in fact most ( 90% ) of the milky way s ionized gas is outside individual stromgren spheres around ob stars ( reynolds 1993 ) .",
    "the next generation plates ( poss 2 ) are sensitive to emission of @xmath4  r , or @xmath54 times fainter than poss 1 , but for both poss 1 and poss 2 , it is impossible to identify and quantify the emission specifically from the h@xmath0 line because the filters are broadband .",
    "sivan ( 1974 ) conducted a photographic survey in search of the wim , reaching a limiting brightness of 15 r and covering low galactic latitudes ( @xmath6 20 ) at a resolution of approximately 10 .",
    "later , parker , gull , and kirschner ( 1979 ) , using an image tube camera , produced an atlas of images in four emission lines ( [ sii],h@xmath0 + [ nii ] , o[iii ] , h@xmath7 ) and the blue continuum ( 4220  ) , which covered low galactic latitudes ( @xmath8 ) at an angular resolution of 0.6  and sensitivity of 15 r.",
    "in this section i note briefly recent reviews similar to this one .",
    "each of the other reviews describe the physical relationship between the h@xmath0 and free - free emissions and their implications for observing the cmb .",
    "smoot ( 1998 ) reviews the topic as it was in january , 1998 .",
    "valls - gabaud ( 1998 ) , bartlett & amram ( 1998 ) , and marcelin _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) are similar to each other , each with a slightly different emphasis .",
    "( valls - gabaud , bartlett , and amram are co - authors of marcelin _",
    "et al . _ ) .",
    "valls - gabaud ( 1998 ) is notable for its thorough discussion of the proportionality between the brightness temperature due to free - free @xmath9 and the surface brightness in h@xmath0 , @xmath10 .",
    "this review necessarily repeats some of the material in the aforementioned reviews and adds to them the advances of 1998 , by the end of which the h@xmath0 sky had been observed very nearly in its entirety .",
    "because there are treatises on the topic of electron - ion interaction ( e.g. mezger & henderson 1967 ; osterbrock 1989 , jackson 1975 ) , and because the papers cited in the previous section summarize the topic , we do not repeat that information here except to note the most basic formulae .",
    "both free - free and recombination radiation ( e.g. h@xmath0  ) are proportional to the emission measure , @xmath11 at moderate galactic latitudes , the h@xmath0 emission ( which traces the free - free emission ) has been modeled as ( reynolds 1992 ) @xmath12 where 1 rayleigh ( r ) is defined as @xmath13 which for h@xmath0 corresponds to an emission measure em = 2.75 @xmath14pc for gas at 10@xmath15  k ( reynolds 1990 ) , or @xmath16 erg @xmath17 s@xmath18 sr@xmath18 , or @xmath19 erg @xmath17 s@xmath18 arcsec@xmath20 . like",
    "the other constituents of the milky way , the h@xmath0   varies considerably across the sky .",
    "the ratio of free - free brightness temperature @xmath9 to the h@xmath0 surface brightness @xmath10 for case b recombination is ( valls - gabaud 1998 ) @xmath21}\\over{i_\\alpha [ r ] } } = 10.4 \\nu^{-2.14 } t_4^{0.527 } 10^{0.029/t_4 } ( 1 + 0.08)\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the observing frequency in ghz , and the last factor ( 1 + 0.08 ) assumes that helium ( 0.08 by number with respect to hydrogen ) is entirely in the form of he@xmath23 , which creates free - free emission like hydrogen , but of course does nt emit h@xmath0 light . this relation is the basis for using h@xmath0 as a tracer of free - free .",
    "it plotted in figure 1 and is tabulated below .",
    ".free - free to h@xmath0 ratio [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     smoot ( 1998 ) has collected estimates of the slope of the correlation of h@xmath0 and dust , and of free - free and dust ; those are reproduced in table 2 .",
    "the aforementioned result , i@xmath24 to 2.0 r / ( mjy  sr@xmath18 ) , and a result of lim _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) are included also .    from data like those in table 2",
    ", it has been noted that the h@xmath0 observations imply less radio emission per unit dust emission than is observed in microwaves ( kogut 1997 ; smoot 1998 ) .",
    "if true , this might be evidence of an additional mechanism for microwave emission emanating from dust , perhaps of the sort described by lazarian ( in this volume ) and plotted in figure 1 .",
    "we can test the hypothesis that a single value for the ratio i@xmath25 is consistent with the data in table 2 . in doing so",
    ", we assume the measurements are not biased and that the error distributions are normal ( a.k.a .",
    "gaussian ) . as a practical matter",
    ", we do not include results that lack formal error estimates.3 ( finkbeiner 1999 ) . ]",
    "the maximum likelihood value is 0.86 ( @xmath260.2 ) r / ( mjy  sr@xmath18 ) .",
    "no individual result differs from the maximum likelihood value by more than 2.3 times the respective standard deviation . for the 6 measurements and 1 degree of freedom , the minimum @xmath27 , which occurs 2% of the time by chance alone .",
    "the lim et al ( 1996 ) result may be affected by anisotropy in the cmb ( kogut 1997 ) , and if we disregard it , then for the 5 remaining measurements , the minimum @xmath28 , which occurs 5% of the time by chance alone .",
    "therefore , these data do not refute the hypothesis convincingly , especially if one considers the additional possibilities of bias in the means and non - gaussian errors .",
    "kogut _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) report a good correlation between free - free emission and dust on @xmath29  angular scales observed with cobe s dmr .",
    "mccullough ( 1997 ) reports a weak correlation between h@xmath0 emission and dust on @xmath30  angular scales .",
    "that the correlation weakens with decreasing angular scale can be understood with a simple geometric model in which neutral dusty clouds are externally ionized from a source emanating from the galactic plane .",
    "a good example is shown in figure 6c and d. the dust cloud has a `` silver lining '' of h@xmath0 emission on the side of cloud nearest the galactic plane .",
    "the same phenomenon is evident in another cloud at higher latitude ( mccullough 1997 ) .",
    "the external ionization creates a skin of ionized gas preferentially on the side of the cloud nearest the galactic plane .",
    "the narrowness of the h@xmath0 lining indicates that the source of ionization does nt penetrate far into the cloud .",
    "( the 100  surface brightness implies a@xmath31 mag , so h@xmath0 light can pass through the cloud with minor attenuation . )",
    "if the surface of a cloud is uniformly ionized , for example by external photoionization , the `` silver lining '' effect will occur wherever the cloud s surface is tangent to the line of sight , due to the longer path length .",
    "this model predicts that the degree of correlation between dust and ionized gas ( observed by h@xmath0 or free - free emission ) will be a ) weak on angular scales smaller than the size of a typical cloud but b ) stronger on much larger angular scales .",
    "( 1998 ) report wham data showing h@xmath0 emission with little if any association with other emissions such as x - ray , infrared , or 21-cm . on the whole ,",
    "narrowband images support this view , namely that in many cases , there is no obvious relationship between ionized gas and other constituents .",
    "however , in some case such as those discussed in the previous paragraphs , the detail revealed in the narrowband images clearly show a physical association .",
    "in other cases , the velocity revealed by spectroscopy is critical to our understanding .",
    "halpha observations completed in the past year will provide a template of the free - free emission from the milky way .",
    "the h@xmath0 sky has been observed with a high - sensitivity fabry - perot spectrometer from the northern hemisphere , and with a narrowband imager from the southern hemisphere .",
    "approximately 38% of the h@xmath0 sky has been observed with both instruments .",
    "both surveys are sufficiently sensitive to detect warm ionized hydrogen gas at all galactic latitudes .",
    "a simple geometric model is proposed to explain observed correlations between ionized gas and dust .",
    "astronomers interested in the cmb will create maps that are free of free - free for free ( i.e. without paying a noise penalty inherent in multi - frequency estimates of free - free emission ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to quantify the location and the brightness of another foreground such as that from rotating dust grains by comparing the h@xmath0 template with the templates of synchrotron , free - free ( directly - observed in microwaves ) , and thermal dust .",
    "we have benefited from the help of the wham team , in particular matt haffner , ron reynolds , and steve tufte .",
    "students that have assisted us are bender , chen , farney , hall , hentges , khosrowshahi , logan , oh , pulokas , raschke , schneider , seaton , and tajima .",
    "we also appreciate the assistance of the staff of ctio in installing and maintaining our robot . the authors research has been supported by grants from the national science foundation , las cumbres observatory , dudley observatory , the fund for astrophysical research , the research corporation , nasa , swarthmore college , and the university of illinois at urbana - champaign .",
