    "entanglement , first noted by einstein and schrdinger , is one of the most important features of a many - body quantum system . nowadays",
    ", it is a crucial physical resource widely used in quantum information processing ( qip ) , as in quantum communication @xcite and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the characterization of entanglement , especially at a quantitative level , is fundamentally important . compared with bipartite entanglement ,",
    "which is now well understood in many aspects , the characterization of multipartite entanglement is still very challenging though a lot of effort has been made ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that a good entanglement measure should be non - negative , invariant under local unitary ( lu ) transformation , and nonincreasing on average under local operations and classical communications ( locc ) , i.e. , entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "recently , based on quantitative complementarity relations ( qcrs ) @xcite , an average multipartite correlation measure @xmath0 is introduced , which was proved to satisfy the first two conditions @xcite . from much numerical analysis ,",
    "it was conjectured that @xmath0 also has the entanglement monotone property and thus may be able to characterize the multipartite entanglement in a four - qubit pure state @xcite .",
    "however , the analytical proof of the conjecture is extremely difficult for a general quantum state . in this sense",
    ", it seems helpful to look into the conjecture in certain cases , which , on one hand , allows us to obtain exact results , and , on the other hand , gives us useful information beyond bipartite entanglement .",
    "cluster states , which are typically multipartite entangled states , are utilized in quantum error - correcting codes @xcite and tests of quantum nonlocality @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are also a universal resource in one - way quantum computation @xcite . in optical systems ,",
    "a four - qubit cluster state has been prepared and applied to the grover search algorithm @xcite more recently , a six - photon cluster state was also produced @xcite .",
    "so , in order to make better use of the cluster state , it is quite desirable to explore quantitatively the entanglement in this kind of system .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the multipartite quantum correlations in four - qubit cluster - class states . here , by a cluster - class state , we mean the output state of a cluster state under stochastic locc ( slocc @xcite ) . for this class of quantum states ,",
    "we prove exactly that the average multipartite correlation @xmath0 is entanglement monotone .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the three- and four - qubit correlations @xmath1 and @xmath2 are also entanglement monotone when setting @xmath1 to be a mixed three - tangle .",
    "more intriguingly , a set of hierarchy entanglement measures are thus obtained rigorously in the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the entanglement monotone property of multipartite correlations in the cluster - class states is proven exactly . in sec .",
    "iii , we address several relevant key issues and give a brief conclusion .",
    "before analyzing these quantum correlations , we first recall the qcrs and the definition of average multipartite quantum correlation . as an essential principle of quantum mechanics",
    ", complementarity often refers to mutually exclusive properties . the quantitative version of the complementarity relation in an @xmath3-qubit pure state is also provided and formulated as @xcite @xmath4 , where the linear entropy @xmath5 characterizes the total quantum correlation of qubit @xmath6 with the remaining qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a measure of single - particle property . for an @xmath3-qubit pure state , the linear entropy",
    "is contributed by the different levels of quantum correlation , i.e. , @xmath9 , in which @xmath10 represents the genuine @xmath11-qubit correlation for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "based on the qcrs , an average multipartite correlation measure in a four - qubit pure state is introduced @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sum of the single residual correlations and @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 ( here , the square of the concurrence quantifies the two - qubit correlation ) .",
    "it is conjectured that @xmath0 is entanglement monotone and can characterize the multipartite entanglement in the system .",
    "however , the proof of this property is extreme difficult for a generic quantum state , although a numerical analysis supports the conjecture .    due to the important applications in qip ,",
    "cluster states have been paid more and more attention in recent years . as shown in fig.1 ,",
    "these states are associated with graphs where each vertex represents a qubit prepared in the initial state @xmath17 and each edge represents a controlled phase gate applyed between two qubits @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the multipartite quantum correlations in four - qubit cluster - class states that are related to the cluster states by slocc .",
    "in the following , we will analyze the entanglement monotone property of the average multipartite correlation @xmath0 and the three- , and four - qubit correlations @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in this class of quantum states .      in one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattices",
    ", the four - qubit cluster state can be written as @xmath18 after lu transformation .",
    "the entanglement monotone property requires that the correlation @xmath0 does not increase on average under locc .",
    "it is known that any local operation can be implemented by a sequence of two - outcome positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) such as @xmath19 which satisfies @xmath20 @xcite . according to the singular - value decomposition @xcite",
    ", the povm operators can be written as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unitary matrices , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are real numbers in range @xmath27 . due to the lu invariance of the @xmath0 , we need only to consider the diagonal matrices .",
    "the output state of @xmath28 under a general povm operator ( i.e. , the slocc operation ) has the form @xmath29 where the normalized parameters @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are complex numbers and we refer to @xmath32 as the cluster - class state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the form of this quantum state is not changed under the next povm , the entanglement monotone property of @xmath33 will be satisfied only if the quantity is nonincreasing under the first level of the povm .    for the quantum state @xmath32 , the two - qubit reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath34 reads @xmath35 note that the two - qubit quantum correlation may be defined as @xmath36 , where the concurrence @xmath37 $ ] with the decreasing positive real numbers @xmath38 being the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath39 @xcite . after a simple calculation",
    ", we get @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath41 and @xmath42 for other subsystems .",
    "the linear entropy of qubit-@xmath43 , @xmath44 ) @xcite can quantify the total quantum correlation between two subsystems @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "so , the multipartite correlation related to qubit @xmath43 , i.e. , the residual correlation , is @xmath46 with a similar derivation , we can obtain @xmath47 , which means that the single residual correlation @xmath48 is invariant under permutations of qubits and the average correlation @xmath49 .    under the povm @xmath19 performed on the subsystem @xmath43 , two quantum states @xmath50 and @xmath51 are available with probabilities @xmath52",
    "$ ] for @xmath53 .",
    "note that the linear entropy and the concurrence are invariant under determinant one slocc operation ( i.e. , for the quantum states @xmath32 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , the two meaures are invariant if the povm operator satisfies @xmath56 ) @xcite ; we can obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 . with a similar deduction as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can derive the following relation : @xmath59 combining the permutation invariance of the @xmath48 , we can draw the conclusion that the single residual correlation @xmath60 is entanglement monotone and can characterize the multipartite entanglement in the system .    for this kind of quantum state , the contour plot of @xmath0 versus the non - normalized real parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "is depicted in fig.2.1 , where the parameters @xmath63 are fixed . in the regions near @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the multipartite entanglement has larger values , as the quantum state @xmath32 tends to the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state . in the regions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath0 has smaller values , as the quantum state approaches the product state .",
    "in particular , when the real parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the multipartite entanglement reaches the maximum @xmath70 .",
    "in this case , the quantum state can be rewritten as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this state is the generalized bell state , i.e. , the maximal bipartite entangled state between subsystems @xmath34 and @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath75 is a product state , @xmath76 is a ghz state .",
    "when @xmath75 is a bell state , @xmath76 is a cluster state @xmath77 .    in two - dimensional lattices",
    ", the four - qubit cluster - class state has the form @xmath78 where the parameters @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are also complex .",
    "this kind of quantum state is related to the box cluster state ( @xmath79 ) via slocc . for the cluster - class state , we can obtain the concurrences @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the other subsystems .",
    "unlike in the 1d case , the single residual correlation @xmath82 is not permutation invariant and does not satisfy the entanglement monotone property . as an example",
    ", we consider the quantum state @xmath83 , where the non - normalized coefficients @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . after a simple calculation",
    ", we have @xmath87 and @xmath88 . under the povm performed on qubit @xmath43 ( here @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) ,",
    "the change of the residual correlation is @xmath91 .",
    "however , the average multipartite correlation @xmath92 is entanglement monotone , which can be proven as follows .",
    "first , we consider the povm @xmath19 performed on the subsystem @xmath43 . due to the lu - invariant property of the @xmath0 , we need only consider the diagonal matrices in the singular - value decomposition form , as the output states , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are obtained with the probabilities @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the correlation @xmath97 can be separated into two components @xmath98 and @xmath99 , on which the effects are different under the povm .",
    "the component @xmath100 is invariant under the determinant one slocc . with this property , we can derive @xmath101\\zeta_1(\\psi^{(2)})$ ] , where @xmath102 ( in the general case , this quantity is not guaranteed to be non - negative ) . for the component @xmath103 , the change is @xmath104 $ ] , which is equivalent to the changes of the linear entropies induced by the mixed state decomposition of subsystems @xmath105 for @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "after some tedious calculation , the change of the average multipartite correlation is @xmath107/p_1p_2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is obviously a non - negative number .",
    "this means that the correlation @xmath97 does not increase on average under the povm performed on qubit @xmath43 .",
    "but , since the quantities @xmath100 and @xmath103 are variant under the permutation of two qubits , we still need to consider the povms performed on the subsystems @xmath108 , and @xmath109 . after a similar analysis",
    ", we can derive the change of the correlation under the povm on qubit @xmath110 as @xmath111/p_1p_2 $ ] , which is also non - negative .",
    "for the povm on the subsystem @xmath112 , one can separate the correlation @xmath0 into two components @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( the non - negative property of @xmath115 is guaranteed by the monogamy relation @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath116 is nonincreasing due to the slocc invariance , and @xmath115 is non - increasing because of the concave and convex properties of the linear entropy and the concurrence , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 is also nonincreasing under this povm .",
    "the case of the povm on the subsystem @xmath109 is similar . according to the above analysis",
    ", we can draw the conclusion that the correlation @xmath97 is entanglement monotone and can characterize the multipartite entanglement in the system .    in fig.2.2 ,",
    "the change of @xmath97 with the non - normalized real parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 are fixed ) is plotted .",
    "when @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath117 and the quantum states tend to the four - qubit product state .",
    "when @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the multipartite entanglement has rather large values ( @xmath120 ) , where the quantum state approximates to the product state of a single - qubit state and a three - qubit ghz state .",
    "the maximum @xmath70 appears at the point @xmath121 , where the quantum state is just the box cluster state @xmath122 .",
    "finally , we address the entanglement monotone property of @xmath0 in a three - dimensional cluster - class state , which is a trivial case .",
    "this state has the form @xmath123 and relates to the four - qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger state via the slocc operation .",
    "the quantum state @xmath124 is invariant under the permutation of qubits and all its two - qubit concurrences are zeros . under the next level of the povm , the same properties still hold .",
    "so , the single residual correlation @xmath125 is entanglement monotone and satisfies @xmath126 .",
    "it is obvious that the average correlation @xmath127 is also entanglement monotone and can characterize the multipartite entanglement in the system .      in a four - qubit pure state @xmath128",
    ", there are five multipartite correlation parameters ( c.f . the venn diagram in @xcite ) , i.e. , one genuine four - qubit correlation @xmath129 and four three - qubit correlations @xmath130 . according to the qcrs",
    ", we have a set of equations @xcite @xmath131 where @xmath15 is the single - residual correlation related to qubit @xmath6 , and the subscripts @xmath132 .",
    "note that these four equations are unable to determine completely the five correlation parameters .",
    "in fact , at least one additional independent relation for either @xmath1 or @xmath2 is needed in this case .",
    "as is known , the mixed three - tangle is a good entanglement measure for a three - qubit mixed state ; it is defined as @xcite @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the pure state three - tangle @xcite and the minimum runs over all the pure state decompositions of @xmath135 . however , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath136 is not compatible with the qcrs in some specific four - qubit pure states [ for example , the quantum state @xmath137 @xcite ] .",
    "so , for the cluster - class states , it is necessary to check whether or not the @xmath136 can quantify correctly the @xmath1 in the qcrs . if @xmath136 does this , we are able to obtain the genuine four - qubit correlation @xmath2 in terms of eq . ( 11 ) .    for the cluster - class state @xmath32 in 1d lattices , the three - qubit reduced density matrices have the form @xmath138 , in which @xmath139 and @xmath140 are two - qubit entangled states .",
    "if one uses the mixed three - tangle to quantify the three - qubit correlation , the relation @xmath141 can be obtained . substituting this relation into eq .",
    "( 11 ) , one can solve the genuine four - qubit correlation @xmath142 . according to the analysis in sec .",
    "iia , we know that the quantity @xmath143 satisfies all three requirements of an entanglement measure . therefore , for the cluster - class state @xmath32 , a set of correlation measures @xmath144 which all are entanglement monotone [ we define @xmath145 can characterize the genuine two- , three- , and four - qubit entanglement in the system . for the cluster - state @xmath124 in 3d lattices ,",
    "the case is similar .",
    "its three - qubit reduced density matrix is @xmath146 and the corresponding three - tangle @xmath136 is zero . after using @xmath136 to quantify the correlation @xmath1",
    ", one can solve the correlation @xmath147 , which is also entanglement monotone .",
    "so , the correlation measures @xmath144 can characterize the different levels of entanglement in the cluster - class state @xmath124 .    in the cluster - class state @xmath83 ,",
    "the situation is non - trivial .",
    "if one uses the mixed three - tangle to quantify the correlation @xmath1 , it is straightforward to find that @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "substituting the two zero @xmath1s into eq . ( 11 ) , one can obtain the other three multipartite correlations @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 . at this stage , we need to consider _ whether or not the mixed three - tangle @xmath136 is compatible with the qcrs in this system and whether the correlation @xmath2 is appropriate to characterize the genuine four - qubit entanglement_.    we first analyze the compatibility of @xmath136 with the qcrs in the system .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath153 into its eigenstates can be written as @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",

    "similarly , for the quantum state @xmath169 , we can obtain @xmath170 as well .",
    "so , in any pure state decomposition of @xmath153 , the entanglements of subsystems @xmath34 and @xmath171 are both zeros",

    "therefore , in the cluster - class state @xmath83 , the mixed three - tangle @xmath136 can quantify correctly the correlation @xmath1 and is compatible with the qcrs .    with the qcrs",

    "since the correlation @xmath2 is invariant under the permutations of qubits , we only need consider the povm @xmath19 performed on the subsystem @xmath43 in which the diagonal matrices are @xmath179 and @xmath180 , respectively .",
    "after the povm , two output states are available with probabilities @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , and the change of the correlation is @xmath181 . due to the non - negativity of the two factors in @xmath182 @xcite , the correlation",
    "@xmath183 is entanglement monotone .",
    "therefore , the set of correlation measures @xmath144 is able to characterize the entanglements of two , three , and four qubits in the cluster - class state @xmath83 , namely they can be good entanglement measures for the corresponding multi - body systems .    in fig.3 ,",
    "the variations of the two- , three- , and four - qubit entanglements with the non - normalized parameters @xmath61 and @xmath184 are plotted .",
