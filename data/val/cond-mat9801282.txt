    "renormalization group ( rg ) theory made tremendous progress in understanding the physics of phase transitions of the second order ( for review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it allows one to calculate critical exponents with a very high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "moreover , it predicts a series of qualitative effects , such as the transformation of a continuous phase transition in some anisotropic systems into jump - like phase transitions due to the fluctuation interaction @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these transformations can not be proven rigorously within the framework of rg .",
    "it is just a general belief that a flow of rg trajectories out of the region of stability of a ginzburg - landau - wilson functional corresponds to a first order phase transition driven by fluctuations .",
    "there is a possibility that either such a treatment is incorrect or that such a flow away is a result of approximations , e.g. , the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "therefore , the treatment of these systems with the help of exactly solvable models , which at least partially take into account fluctuation effects , may clarify the situation .",
    "if an exactly solvable model yields results analogous to the ones of rg theory , it would be a serious argument in support of the reality of these qualitative effects .",
    "in this paper we consider phase transitions in a system with two coupled scalar order parameters described by the ginzburg - landau - wilson functional @xmath1 + \\frac{1}{2}w\\phi _ { 1}^{2}({\\bf x})\\phi _ { 2}^{2}({\\bf x})\\right\\ } , \\label{glw}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is a trial critical temperature for the field @xmath4 .",
    "according to the mean field theory , lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the @xmath7 plane are lines of the second order phase transitions into phases @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively [ fig .",
    "however , the rg analysis shows that disorder ",
    "order phase transitions in the system described by the functional ( 1 ) can be of the first order@xcite .",
    "our goal is to compare results of the rg theory with results of the exactly solvable model described below .",
    "our model uses a simplified physical picture of phase transitions . while preserving the symmetry of the system , it takes into account interaction of fluctuations with equal and opposite momenta only .",
    "this can be provided by splitting a @xmath10-function , @xmath11 , which is responsible for the momentum conservation , into a product of two @xmath10-functions , @xmath12 . in coordinate space",
    "such a splitting corresponds to the following reduction of the interaction terms in the functional ( [ glw ] ) @xmath13 ^{2 } ,   \\label{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the volume of the system . in its simplest version",
    "the model has the same critical asymptotics @xcite as the spherical model @xcite .",

    "there are two ordered phases , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , that are separated by a line of the first order phase transition . at the second case there is an additional ordered phase , @xmath43 , which is separated from the other two phases by lines of the second order phase transitions .",
    "below we reconstruct these diagrams in the framework of the exactly solvable model .",
    "this diagram is the most interesting one since it can be substantially modified by the interaction of fluctuations .",
    "there are four different solutions of eqs .",

    "the phase transition into an ordered phase is a continues one .",
    "however , as one can see from eq .",

    "comparing free energies for the phases @xmath76 , @xmath60 and @xmath42 one can show that for @xmath77 and when conditions of inequalities ( [ 1order - condition ] ) are true , the lower energy corresponds to the `` anomalous '' , from the mean field theory point of view , phase @xmath78 , @xmath60 .",
    "only if @xmath79 the transition happens into the `` normal '' phase , @xmath80 , @xmath60 .",
    "the analogous result has been obtained in the rg  theory @xcite where it was shown that in the system with competing order parameters , when @xmath81 and trial critical temperatures , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are close to each other , the transition into the ordered phase is of the first order into the anomalous phase with the lower trial critical temperature .",
    "such a phase is stabilized by the interaction of critical fluctuations , and when the temperature decreases further another phase transition into the `` normal '' phase must occur . since the transition into the `` normal '' phase is the transition of the order - order type it must also be of the first kind . hence , the fluctuation interaction splits the continuous phase transition , predicted by the mean field theory , into two transitions of the first order .",
    "the effect must disappear when fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "the model provides a simple way of regulating the strength of fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations are suppressed in systems with long - range interactions .",
    "the parameters @xmath84 represent the radii of interactions in the original system in which critical behavior is described by ginzburg - landau functional ( [ glw ] ) . the ginzburg number , @xmath85 that defines the width of the domain where fluctuation are essential , is proportional to @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "so , setting @xmath88 we suppress fluctuations . in this case",
    "the order parameter ( [ order - p-1 ] ) becomes proportional to @xmath89 and the transition becomes of the second order .",
    "it is interesting to note that the effect of inducing the first order transition into the phase @xmath76 , @xmath60 is controlled only by the fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath90 ( and , of course by the coupling , @xmath91 , between modes ) .",
    "using the model , the phase diagram corresponding to the first order phase transition into the anomalous phase is schematically shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in the mean field theory the case of @xmath92 corresponds to the phase diagram with the tetracritical point shown in fig .",
    "according to the model , the phase @xmath78 , @xmath60 corresponds to the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ saddle1 ] ) and ( [ saddle2 ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath93 defined by eq . ( [ order - p-1 ] ) , which independently of the sign of @xmath91 , always has a solution and the transition is of the second order .",
    "the critical temperature in this case is defined by @xmath94    the rg  theory , however , allows for a fluctuation induced first order phase transition when @xmath92 and @xmath95 .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to that the model takes into account fluctuations in a limited manner .",
    "the transition between ordered phases is described by eqs .",
    "( [ saddle1 ] ) and ( [ saddle2 ] ) with @xmath96 @xmath97@xmath98 these equations have ordinary mean field theory solutions @xmath99 which exists when @xmath100 according to eqs .",
