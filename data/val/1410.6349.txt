    "the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) is the phenomenon of electric charge separation along the external magnetic field that is introduced by the chirality imbalance  @xcite .",
    "it is proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite that off - central relativistic heavy - ion collisions can create strong transient magnetic fields due to the fast , oppositely directed motion of two colliding nuclei .",
    "the magnetic field perpendicular to the reaction plane is aligned .",
    "extremely strong ( electromagnetic ) magnetic fields are present in non - central collisions , albeit for a very short time . thus , relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide a unique terrestrial environment to study qcd in strong magnetic field surroundings  @xcite .",
    "this so - called chiral magnetic effect may serve as a sign of the local p and cp violation of qcd . by using relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    ", one can investigate the behavior of qcd at extremely high - energy densities .    in non - central collisions",
    "opposite charge quarks would tend to be emitted in opposite directions relative to the system angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry in the emission of quarks would be reflected in an analogous asymmetry between positive- and negative - pion emission directions .",
    "this phenomenon is introduced by the large ( electro- ) magnetic field produced in non - central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the same phenomenon can also be depicted in terms of induction of electric field by the ( quasi ) static magnetic field , which happens in the occurrence of these topologically nontrivial vacuum solutions .",
    "the induced electric field is parallel to the magnetic field and leads to the charge separation in that direction .",
    "thus , the charge separation can be viewed as a nonzero electric dipole moment of the system .",
    "experimentally , rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite have published the measurements of cme by the two - particle or three - particle correlations of charged particles with respect to the reaction plane , which are qualitatively consistent with the cme . a clear signal compatible with a charge dependent separation relative to the reaction plane is observed , which shows little or no collision energy dependence when compared to measurements at rhic energies .",
    "this provides a new insight for understanding the nature of the charge - dependent azimuthal correlations observed at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "recent years , lots of attentions  @xcite have been paid to the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) .",
    "it is shown that this effect originates from the existence of nontrivial topological configurations of gauge fields and their interplay with the chiral anomaly which results in an asymmetry between left- and right - handed quarks .",
    "the created strong magnetic field coupled to a chiral asymmetry can induce an electric charge current along the direction of a magnetic field .",
    "the strong magnetic field will separate particles of opposite charges with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "recently , possible cme and topological charge fluctuations have been recognized by qcd lattice calculations in gauge theory  @xcite and in qcd + qed with dynamical @xmath1 quark flavors  @xcite .",
    "thus , such topological and cme effects in qcd might be recognized in relativistic heavy - ion collisions directly in the presence of very intense external electromagnetic fields .",
    "lots of analytical and numerical calculations indicate existence of extremely powerful electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "they are the strongest electromagnetic fields that exist in nature  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite has discussed the electromagnetic response of the plasma produced by relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is found that the effects to have an important impact on the field dynamics .",
    "an exact analytical and numerical solution for the space and time dependencies of an electromagnetic field produced in heavy - ion collisions was presented in ref  @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed that nuclear matter plays a crucial role  @xcite in its time evolution .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used the wood - saxon nucleon distribution instead of uniform distribution to improve the calculation of the magnetic field of the central point for non - central collision in the rhic and lhc energy regions . in this paper , we will use the improved magnetic field model to calculate the spatial distribution feature of the chiral magnetic field in the rhic and lhc energy regions .",
    "the dependencies of the spatial features of magnetic fields on the collision energies , centralities , and collision time will be systematically investigated , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the key points of the improved model of magnetic field are described in sec .",
    "the calculation results of the magnetic field are present in sec .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "the improved model of magnetic field mainly contains three parts :    \\(1 ) as shown in fig.1 , two similar relativistic heavy nuclei with charge @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 are traveling in the positive and negative @xmath4 direction with rapidity @xmath5 . at @xmath6",
    "they go through a non - central collision with impact parameter @xmath7 at the origin point .",
    "the center of the two nuclei are taken at @xmath8 at time @xmath6 so that the direction of @xmath7 lies along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the region in which the two nuclei overlap contains the participants , the regions in which they do not overlap contain the spectators .    as the nuclei are nearly traveling with the speed of light in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments , the lorentz contraction factor",
    "@xmath10 is so large that the two included nuclei can be taken as pancake shape(as the @xmath11 plane ) .",
    "we use the wood - saxon nuclear distribution instead of uniform nuclear distribution  @xcite .",
    "the wood - saxon nuclear distribution forms is : @xmath12    here @xmath13 = 0.54 fm , @xmath14 = 0.17 @xmath15 and the radius @xmath3=1.12 a@xmath16 fm . considering the lorentz contraction ,",
    "the density of the two - dimensional plane can be given by :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the normalization constant .",
    "the number densities of the colliding nuclei can be normalized as    @xmath19    \\(2 ) secondly , in order to study the strength of the magnetic field caused by the two relativistic traveling nuclei , we can split the contribution of particles to the magnetic field in the time @xmath20 .",
    "the specific forms of expression for the contribution of particles to the magnetic field in the following way    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the the contributions of the spectators and the participants moving in the positive or negative @xmath4 direction , respectively . for spectators",
    ", we assume that they do not scatter at all and that they keep traveling with the beam rapidity @xmath5 . combining with eq.(2 ) , we use the density above and give    @xmath24\\frac{(\\vec{x}^\\prime_\\bot-\\vec{x}_\\bot)\\times\\vec{e}_z } { [ ( \\vec{x}^\\prime_\\bot-\\vec{x}_\\bot)^2+\\tau^2\\sinh(y_0\\mp\\eta)^2]^{3/2 } } , \\label{eq : eq5 } % eq.5\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the proper time , @xmath26 $ ] is the space - time rapidity , and    @xmath27 .",

    "the contribution of the participants to the magnetic field can be given by    @xmath30^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } \\label{eq : eq8 } % eq.8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    \\(3 ) in the third part , in order to study the spatial distribution of the magnetic field , we will calculate the @xmath31 and @xmath32 components of the chiral magnetic field from spectator and participant nuclei .",
    "the specific forms of the contribution of @xmath31 and @xmath32 components from the spectator and participant nuclei are given as follows : @xmath33 \\frac{(x^\\prime - x ) } { [ ( \\vec{x}^\\prime_\\bot-\\vec{x}_\\bot)^2+\\tau^2\\sinh(y_0\\mp\\eta)^2]^{3/2 } } , \\label{eq : eq9 } % eq.9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 component of magnetic field from spectators , and the @xmath9 component of magnetic field from spectators is given by : @xmath36 \\frac{(y^\\prime - y ) } { [ ( \\vec{x}^\\prime_\\bot-\\vec{x}_\\bot)^2+\\tau^2\\sinh(y_0\\mp\\eta)^2]^{3/2 } } , \\label{eq : eq10 } % eq.10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the other hand , the @xmath35 component of magnetic field from participants is given by : @xmath37^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } \\label{eq : eq11 } % eq.11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the @xmath9 component of magnetic field from participants is given by : @xmath38^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } \\label{eq : eq12 } % eq.12\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in order to study the dependencies of magnetic field @xmath39 on proper time , we show the dependencies of magnetic field @xmath39 ( at central point @xmath40 ) on proper time @xmath41 at @xmath0 = 200 gev for au - au collisions with b=8fm and @xmath0 = 2760 gev for pb - pb collisions with b = 8 fm , respectively . from fig.2(a , b ) , one can find that at small proper time the magnetic field is mainly from the contribution of spectator nucleons , but as the proper time increases , more and more large contribution of the magnetic field is from participant nucleon .",
    "figure 2(c , d ) show the comparisons of the magnetic field and the ratio of @xmath42 at @xmath0 = 200 gev and @xmath0 = 2760 gev .",
    "one can find that at smaller proper time @xmath41(@xmath43 fm ) the magnetic field at @xmath0 = 2760 gev is greater than that of @xmath0 = 200 gev , but when @xmath44 fm , the magnetic field at @xmath0 = 2760 gev is less than that of @xmath0 = 200 gev . from fig.2(d )",
    "one can find that the contribution of magnetic field from participant nucleons increases with the increase of proper time .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependencies of magnetic field @xmath39 ( at central point @xmath45 ) on central of mass energy @xmath0 at different proper time @xmath41 .",
    "it is argued that at smaller proper time ( @xmath41 = 0.001 and 0.0001fm ) the magnetic fields increase with the increase of the cms energy ( @xmath0 ) , but with the increase of proper time ( @xmath41 ) , the magnetic field decreases sharply with increasing collision energy of @xmath0 .",
    "it is found that when @xmath41 = 3 fm and @xmath46 gev , the magnetic field approaches zero .    for consistency with the experimental results ,",
    "we take au - au collision with rhic energy region and pb - pb collision with lhc energy region . when studying the spatial distribution characteristics of magnetic field",
    ", we choose the spatial regions of -10.0 fm @xmath47 10.0 fm and -10.0 fm @xmath48 10.0 fm .",
    "figure 4 shows the magnetic field spatial distributions of @xmath32 with different collision energies @xmath0 = 62.4 gev , 130 gev and 200 gev and proper time @xmath49 fm .",
    "the collision energies shown in fig .",
    "4 are in rhic energy region .",
    "the spatial distributions of @xmath32 show obviously axis symmetry characteristics along @xmath50 and @xmath51 axes .",
    "there is a peak around central point @xmath40 , and the magnetic field get smaller and smaller when the location go farther away from the center position .",
    "when @xmath49 fm ,    on both sides of @xmath51 line , there are two symmetrical peaks .",
    "these two peaks are almost connected when @xmath0 = 62.4 gev . as the collision energy increases ,",
    "the two peaks start to separate and expose the valley between the two peaks when @xmath0 = 130 gev and 200 gev .",
    "the maximum of magnetic field @xmath32 in rhic energy region reaches @xmath52 mev@xmath53 .",
    "compared with fig.4 , fig.5 shows the magnetic field spatial distributions of @xmath32 in the lhc energy region . when the collision energy rises up to 900 gev in lhc energy region , the distribution features of magnetic field have some differences from that of the rhic energy region .",
    "for example the magnetic field distribution peak around @xmath50 and @xmath51 becomes flat at @xmath0 = 900 gev , and begin to appear the phenomenon of two peaks . the maximum of magnetic field @xmath32 in lhc energy region reaches @xmath54 mev@xmath53 , which is larger than that of rhic energy region at @xmath41 = 0.0001 fm .    from fig.2 to fig.5 , we argue that the magnetic field spatial distributions of @xmath32 are highly inhomogeneous .",
    "the distribution features in the rhic energy region is different from that of the lhc energy region .",
    "it is argued that at smaller proper time ( @xmath41 = 0.001 and 0.0001fm ) the magnetic fields increase with the increase of the cms energy ( @xmath0 ) , but with the increase of proper time ( @xmath41 ) , the magnetic field decreases sharply with increasing collision energy of central of mass @xmath55 .    the above",
    "we make a discussion of magnetic field spatial distributions with the collision energy and impact parameter relations , we will make a study of magnetic field with the proper time .",
    "the magnitude of magnetic field is presented as :    @xmath56    sometimes , one often takes the @xmath35 component @xmath32 to approximately replace @xmath39 .",
    "this is the reason that @xmath32 is usually larger than @xmath31 . in order to verify the rationality of the substitution , we need a detailed study the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath39 .",
    "figure 6 shows the dependencies of the ratio of @xmath57 on @xmath9 and @xmath35 at @xmath0= 200 gev and at different proper time @xmath41 = 0.02 , 0.2 and 2.0 fm , respectively .",
    "the fig.6(a , c and e ) are for @xmath57 with @xmath35 at different proper time . from fig.6(a , c and e )",
    ", one can figure out that the ratio of @xmath57 with @xmath35 change is between 0.9 to 1.0 . in this case",
    ", one can approximate the @xmath32 instead of @xmath39 .",
    "compared with the relation of ratio @xmath57 with @xmath35 , the relationship of ratio @xmath57 with @xmath9 shown as fig.6(b , d and f ) is obviously different .",
    "the main different is the dip located at @xmath50 .",
    "the minimum value of the ratio at @xmath50 can be decreased to 0.5 .    in order to study the spatial distribution of magnetic field on proper time",
    ", we show the dependencies of magnetic field @xmath32 and @xmath31 ( at points @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) on proper time @xmath41 at @xmath55= 200 gev for au - au collisions with b=8fm and @xmath55 = 2760 gev and 7000 gev for pb - pb collisions with b = 8fm , respectively . from fig.7",
    ", one can find that at small proper time the the magnetic field increases with the increase of the collision energy , but the magnetic field of @xmath55 = 7000 gev decrease more quickly than that of @xmath55 = 200 gev with the increase of proper time .",
    "fig.7(c , d ) show that there is a relatively flat region with proper time at point @xmath60 than that at point @xmath58 .",
    "it is shown that an enormous magnetic field can indeed be created in off - central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the magnetic field distributions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are highly inhomogeneous , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 distributions are completely different . the enormous magnetic field is produced just after the collision , and the magnitude of magnetic field of lhc energy region is larger that of rhic energy region at the small proper time(@xmath61 fm ) .",
    "we are really surprised to find that the magnetic field in the lhc energy region decreases more quickly with the increase of the proper time than that of rhic energy region .",
    "as the proper time @xmath41 increases to a certain value @xmath62 fm , the magnitude of magnetic field in the rhic energy region begin to be larger than that of lhc energy region .",
    "the dependencies of the ratio of @xmath57 on @xmath9 and @xmath35 at different collision energies at rhic and lhc and at different proper time are analyzed in this paper . in most cases , the ratio @xmath57 approaches @xmath63 , so this is a good approximate by using @xmath32 to approximately replace @xmath39 .",
    "but one should note that the ratio @xmath57 is between @xmath64 along @xmath50 line .",
    "we systematically study the spatial distribution features of chiral magnetic field in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at energies reached at lhc and rhic with the improved model of chiral magnetic field in this paper .",
    "the feature of chiral magnetic fields at @xmath0= 900 , 2760 and 7000 gev in the lhc energy region and @xmath0 = 62.4 , 130 and 200 gev in the rhic energy region are systematically studied .",
    "the dependencies of the magnetic field on proper time for at rhic and lhc energy regions , respectively . comparing with that of rhic energy region",
    ", one finds that the magnitudes of the magnetic fields with proper time fall more rapidly at lhc energy region .",
    "the variation characteristics of magnetic field with impact parameter at rhic energy region are different from that of lhc energy region .",
