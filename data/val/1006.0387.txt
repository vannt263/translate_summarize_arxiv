    "one of the strongest arguments for studying a fully relativistic formulation of fluid dynamics is the large value of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath2 measured in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite .",
    "these measurements indicate that a new phase of matter , the quark - gluon plasma , is created , which behaves like an almost perfect fluid .",
    "an indication for this is the good agreement between experimental data and theoretical calculations using ideal fluid dynamics , where the viscous transport coefficients vanish ; see , e.g. refs .",
    ",  @xcite .    in nature , the viscous transport coefficients can not vanish but must have lower bounds @xcite .",
    "small viscous corrections are always needed in fluid dynamics to make the flow laminar and stable .",
    "it was later confirmed by calculations within viscous fluid dynamics @xcite and microscopic transport theory @xcite that the shear viscosity has to be sufficiently small in order to keep the agreement with the @xmath2 data .",
    "these calculations suggest that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath3 .    in heavy - ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies",
    "the system expands very fast and gradients in the matter are very large .",
    "it is still an open question to what extent fluid dynamics is applicable in describing the dynamics of such a system .",
    "fluid dynamics is an effective theory that describes the macroscopic evolution of the system close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "its applicability requires that either the viscosity or the gradients are small , or both . on the other hand ,",
    "microscopic transport models can be used for systems which are also strongly out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , a comparison between the microscopic approach and fluid dynamics can provide the limits and accuracy of the fluid - dynamical description .",
    "in this work we will compare solutions of the relativistic boltzmann equation with those of second - order fluid dynamics as derived by israel and stewart ( is ) @xcite .",
    "such a comparison has been previously presented for the bjorken scaling solution @xcite in ref .",
    "the scaling solution provides a simple test case with ( initially ) arbitrarily large expansion rate .",
    "it was concluded that for a good agreement between the fluid - dynamical and kinetic calculations a knudsen number @xmath4 is required .",
    "the knudsen number is the ratio of the mean - free path of the particles and the length scale of the variation of macroscopic fields ( such as the energy density ) .",
    "for the same scaling solution , an extension of the is theory was studied and compared to the kinetic solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bjorken scaling solution is , however , restrictive in the sense that there are no pressure gradients in the local rest frame ( lrf ) of matter . in this paper",
    "we will complement these earlier works by studying the relativistic riemann problem .",
    "this was already investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we continue this line of study with more extensive and detailed comparisons between the fluid - dynamical and transport approaches . the existing analytic solution in the perfect - fluid limit , i.e. , for @xmath5 , makes it possible to check the numerical convergence of the approaches . to our best knowledge",
    "this type of study was never accomplished for relativistic shock phenomena .",
    "the present work is yet another step toward understanding how highly - energetic jets created in the initial stage of an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision interact with the hot and dense medium .",
    "if the latter is a strongly interacting fluid , one expects the creation of shock waves which resemble mach cones . however , if matter is only weakly interacting , these shock waves should be smeared out and a clean mach - cone signal can not be observed @xcite .",

    "[ sec : kinetic_to_is ] the dissipative fluid - dynamical theory of israel and stewart is introduced .",

    "[ sec : numerics ] by a short introduction to the numerical methods we use . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tests ] the relativistic riemann problem and its analytic solution in the perfect - fluid limit are presented .",
    "we demonstrate that numerical calculations using both approaches reproduce the analytic solutions very accurately . in sec .  [",
    "sec : viscous_riemann ] we show comparisons with non - zero viscosities and demonstrate how the agreement between the two approaches deteriorates with increasing viscosity .",
    "these results are then analyzed in terms of a relevant knudsen number in order to estimate the applicability of the is theory .",
    "as in the ideal case , we have found a scaling behavior of the relativistic riemann problem with non - zero viscosity .",

    "we assume that there are no external forces .",

    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the boltzmann h - theorem implies that the entropy production is positive and vanishes in equilibrium _",
    "the particle four - flow and energy - momentum tensor can be decomposed with respect to an arbitrary time - like four - vector @xmath13 , normalized as @xmath14 .",
    "this is chosen in such a way that it can be interpreted as the collective four - velocity of the matter .",
    "the frame where @xmath15 is called the local rest frame . with the help of the transverse projection operator @xmath16 , the most general decomposition can be written as [ n_mu ] n^ & = & n u^ + v^ , + [ t_munu ] t^ & = & e u^ u^ - p^ + w^u^ + w^u^ + ^ , where @xmath17 is the lrf particle density and @xmath18 is the lrf energy density . the spatial trace of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath19 denotes the isotropic pressure .",
    "this is the sum of equilibrium pressure and bulk viscous pressure , @xmath20 .",
    "the flow of particles in the lrf is v^ = ^ _ n^ , while the flow of energy - momentum in the lrf is w^ = ^ t _ u^. the heat flow @xmath21 is defined as q^= w^- h v^ , where @xmath22 is the enthalpy per particle .",

    "the lrf frame particle density and energy density are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "for a system that deviates from local thermodynamical equilibrium , the definition of the flow velocity may follow eckart @xcite or landau and lifshitz @xcite . using eckart s definition of the flow velocity , [ eq_hydro_kinetic : eckart_velocity ] u^_e = , the lrf flow of particles vanishes , @xmath32 , while the flow of energy is given by the heat flow , @xmath33 .    in landau",
    "s frame the flow of matter is tied to the flow of energy , [ eq_hydro_kinetic : landau_velocity ] u^_l = ; hence the flow of energy - momentum vanishes , @xmath34 .    for processes close to equilibrium ,",
    "the above definitions and decompositions are related to each other @xcite .",
    "therefore up to second order in deviations from local equilibrium , that is , @xmath35 , we get u^_l = u^_e + .",
    "this means that the non - equilibrium part of the particle four - flow in landau s frame is related to the heat flow in eckart s frame , that is , @xmath36 .",
    "fluid dynamics is an effective theory for the slow , long - wavelength dynamics of a given system . for systems with well - defined quasi - particles ,",
    "fluid dynamics can be derived in terms of a power series in the knudsen number kn = , where @xmath37 is the mean - free path of the particles and @xmath38 is a macroscopic length scale over which macroscopic fields such as energy density , particle density , or temperature vary .",
    "fluid dynamics as an effective theory can be systematically improved by successively including higher - order terms in @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath39 we obtain an effective theory that does not contain any powers of @xmath39 , corresponding to the limit @xmath40 , that is , the ( unphysical ) limit where @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to infinite scattering rates , and thus the system instantaneously assumes local thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "this is the perfect - fluid limit . to first order in @xmath39",
    ", we obtain the relativistic generalization of navier - stokes theory .",
    "this effective theory is plagued by instabilities and acausalities @xcite .",
    "these problems can be circumvented by including terms of second order in @xmath39 , such as in the fluid - dynamical theory of israel and stewart used in this work .",
    "the fluid - dynamical limit can be derived for any kind of system , that is , its applicability is not restricted to dilute gases , as is the case for the boltzmann equation .",
    "however , since it is an expansion around the perfect - fluid limit , we expect its validity to be restricted to dynamics close to local thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the coefficients of fluid dynamics as an effective theory can be computed by matching to an underlying microscopic theory . in our case , this is the kinetic theory of ultrarelativistic boltzmann particles , described by the boltzmann equation with elastic binary collisions .",
    "note , however , that the matching procedure is not unique @xcite .    in our case",
    "the matching procedure is as follows .",
    "we expand the single - particle distribution function around local thermodynamical equilibrium , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 measures the deviation from the equilibrium distribution function [ eq_distribution ] f_0(x , p ) ( e^p^ u_/+ a)^-1 . here",
    "@xmath44 corresponds to bosons ( fermions ) , and @xmath45 corresponds to boltzmann particles .",
    "the inverse temperature is given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the fugacity .",
    "the validity of the expansion around @xmath48 requires that @xmath49 . in order to match to fluid dynamics as an expansion in powers of @xmath39 , one possibility is to assume that @xmath50 is a series in powers of @xmath39",
    "this approach was pioneered by hilbert , and by chapman and enskog @xcite .",
    "another method was proposed by grad @xcite and was generalized to relativistic systems by israel and stewart @xcite . in this approach , [ eq : f_expansion ] ( x , p ) = + _ p^ + _",
    "p^ p^ , where the coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are the expansion parameters and therefore @xmath54 .    for each non - equilibrium state given by @xmath55 the corresponding equilibrium state @xmath48 is defined by the landau matching conditions @xcite , such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these conditions together with the gibbs equation ensure that the equilibrium part of the pressure is given by the equation of state @xmath58 .    the coefficients of the expansion , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , are determined using eq .   in eqs .   and .",
    "comparing the outcome with eqs .   and , one finds that the parameters of the expansion are proportional to the dissipative quantities @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "thus the deviation from equilibrium is proportional to the ratio of dissipative quantities to local equilibrium quantities , that is , @xmath63 .",
    "however , if the dissipative quantities are close to the navier - stokes values ( see later ) , then these ratios are proportional to the local knudsen number .",
    "the macroscopic equations for the evolution of dissipative quantities can be obtained from the third moment of the single - particle distribution function @xcite . here",
    "we recall the result of this laborious calculation by israel and stewart as presented by huovinen and molnr @xcite . in this paper",

    "the microscopic time scales in the is equations are given by the relaxation times of dissipative quantities @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are of the order of the mean - free path between collisions .",
    "the relevant macroscopic scales can be estimated from the gradients of the primary fluid - dynamical variables .",
    "for example , these can be given in terms of the expansion rate @xmath76 , in terms of the energy density gradient @xmath77 , or in other ways .",
    "if the knudsen number is sufficiently small , then at late times @xmath78 , heat flow and shear viscosity will approach their navier - stokes values , that is , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "the is equations reduce to the navier - stokes equations . furthermore ,",
    "in the limit when all dissipative quantities approach zero , the is equations reduce to the perfect - fluid equations .      for the sake of simplicity , we assume an ultrarelativistic massless boltzmann gas with conserved particle number . in this case , the bulk viscosity vanishes , and the equation of state is simply @xmath83 , where the speed of sound is @xmath84 . for gluons ,",

    "another difference can be seen by inspecting the fugacity and shear pressure in the region where the contact discontinuity would be in the perfect - fluid case . in this region",

    "a similar shock structure was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , called the `` double - shock '' phenomenon by the authors .",
    "it is important to note that in that case a different numerical method , namely , the smoothed particle hydrodynamics , was used to solve the equations of dissipative fluid dynamics , corresponding to the simplified is equations without heat conductivity .",
    "the simplified or truncated is equations only take into account the relaxation term to describe the time evolution of dissipative quantities .    , for @xmath202.,width=325 ]    in the fluid - dynamical calculation this discontinuity originates from the initial discontinuity . in the early stage of the evolution",
    "the effective pressure @xmath205 and velocity take almost constant values near the discontinuity .",
    "the velocity and the gradient of the effective pressure are the driving forces of the expansion .",
    "therefore , if they are constant , nothing happens to the structures in the solution and the original discontinuity disappears very slowly , such that parts of it are still visible in the later stages of the evolution .",
    "a similar difference between the bamps and vshasta results is seen at the right edge of the shock wave .",
    "this part of the profile is again not described correctly by is fluid dynamics , and the difference is already visible for smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "the same is true also for the head of the rarefaction fan , although it is less visible for small viscosities .",
    "this kind of discontinuous behavior can be seen in all relevant fluid - dynamical quantities .    in the bamps calculation",
    "the original discontinuity disappears immediately .",
    "this is because in kinetic theory the evolution near the very steep density gradient is well approximated by free streaming or diffusion of particles , which smooths out all sharp structures very rapidly .",
    "free streaming of particles drives the system immediately far out of thermal equilibrium , hence can not be correctly described by second - order dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "this phenomena was studied and explained in non - relativistic systems m. torrilhon @xmath206 @xmath207@xcite .",
    "they concluded that the viscous fluid - dynamical solutions of the riemann problem actually lead to discontinuous solutions .",
    "for example , in the non - relativistic 13-field equations the system has five instead of three characteristic waves .",
    "although dissipation leads to the attenuation of these waves and smoothing of discontinuities , this can only happen after a sufficiently long time . in case",
    "we include higher moments of the distribution function we will find more characteristics and therefore more discontinuities but with smaller amplitude .",
    "there is an infinite number of moments , which form a hierarchy of equations . therefore by taking into account higher moments the approximations to the boltzmann equation become more precise , which in turn leads to a better approximation for smooth profiles . on this account",
    "we note that there are more recent studies showing that with a special regularization technique the grad s 13-moment method leads to much better results @xcite .",
    "so far these methods have been studied only in the non - relativistic case , but nevertheless they point toward a solution .      as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsec : is_1plus1 ] we neglected the term that couples the heat flux to the shear pressure from the heat - flow equation .",
