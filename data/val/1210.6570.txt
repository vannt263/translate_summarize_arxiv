    "two of the main magnetic fusion energy designs are the axisymmetric tokamak and the non - axisymmetric stellarator .",
    "tokamaks have seen significant heat loss due to turbulence,@xcite while stellarator losses have traditionally been dominated by their larger neoclassical transport .",
    "studying turbulent transport in stellarators is increasingly important , however , as modern stellarator designs ( such as wendelstein 7-as ( w7-as),@xcite wendelstein 7-x ( w7-x),@xcite the national compact stellarator experiment ( ncsx),@xcite the large helical device ( lhd ) @xcite , and the helically symmetric experiment ( hsx ) @xcite ) have shown or are designed to have improved neoclassical confinement and stability properties .",
    "therefore , turbulence could be increasingly relevant in stellarator experiments .",
    "several gyrokinetic studies of drift - wave - driven turbulence in stellarator geometry have been done@xcite with a variety of gyrokinetic codes , such as gs2,@xcite gene,@xcite gkv - x,@xcite and full.@xcite these codes have all been linearly benchmarked against each other for non - axisymmetric geometries.@xcite progress has even been made in optimizing stellarator designs to have reduced turbulent transport.@xcite    besides comparing good stellarator configurations ( as was done in refs .",
    ", among others ) , one would like to compare stellarator confinement with that of tokamaks .",
    "the relative benefits of each device are important to consider when designing the next generation of experiments .",
    "a few previous comparison studies have been done , such as those in refs . . here",
    ", the gyrokinetic turbulence code gs2@xcite is used to compare microinstability of the electrostatic adiabatic ion temperature gradient ( itg ) and the electrostatic collisionless kinetic itg modes in the quasi - axisymmetric national compact stellarator experiment ( ncsx ) design to that of a highly - elongated tokamak . because this tokamak and ncsx geometry differs so significantly , it is hard to pinpoint what parameter has the greatest effect , but overall effects will be examined .",
    "itg mode - driven turbulence has been connected experimentally to measured heat losses in both tokamaks ( e.g. ref . ) and the lhd.@xcite there is much variability in stellarator designs , and it is unclear without more study which modes will dominate in each .",
    "preliminarily , ref . suggests that itg transport in ncsx may be larger than that of etg ( see figs .",
    "8 - 9 of that paper ) .",
    "while only the itg mode thresholds are compared in this paper , further study could show that other modes dominate in this case and in other devices .    in section [ sec : ncsxtok ] , a simple comparison metric",
    "is defined for use in this paper .",
    "sections [ sec : miller]-[sec : ncsx ] describe the tokamak and stellarator configurations : a miller equilibrium for the highly - elongated tokamak , and a numerical equilibrium for ncsx .",
    "next , growth rates and critical temperature gradients are compared for the itg mode in sections [ sec : adie]-[sec : kine ] . finally , the study is concluded in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "to understand the trade - offs between stellarator and axisymmetric geometry and their confinement capabilities , designs can be compared computationally .",
    "one metric of confinement quality is the ratio of the core temperature to the pedestal temperature , @xmath3 , as fusion reactors need very high core temperatures , and high core temperature implies good confinement .",
    "this ratio is related to the critical temperature gradients .",
    "if @xmath4 , temperature - gradient - driven instabilities are marginally stable  a reasonable assumption in a reactor plasma , as temperatures inside the pedestal will be so high that profile stiffness will ensure that gradients are close to marginal stability .",
    "this is demonstrated by fig .",
    "3 of ref . , which shows that fusion power ( and thus the temperature profile ) depends primarily on the pedestal temperature and not the beam power , for the case of balanced beams .    at marginal stability",
    "( assuming @xmath5 is independent of minor radius ) ,    @xmath6    the minimum temperature is at the edge where @xmath7 is maximum , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the minor radius . in this simplified story ,",
    "another approximation will be made , that @xmath10 occurs at @xmath11 .",
    "so , @xmath12 .",

    "@xmath10 is set by non - transport mechanisms and can not be arbitrarily high , leaving @xmath17 as the important parameter in equation [ eqn : coretemp ] . if an alternative fusion device design could increase @xmath17 by just @xmath18 , this would increase the central temperature by @xmath19 , and more than double the fusion power .",
    "( a caveat  this is a simple estimate , and does not take into account the fact that mhd stability changes with higher pressure peakedness . ) in this paper , the critical ion temperature gradients are compared for ncsx and a strongly - shaped tokamak design .",
    "the stated stellarator minor and major radii are the average values .",
    "ncsx runs were compared to a potential high - elongation tokamak based on a composite of aries - at @xcite and jet h - mode shot @xmath2052979 .",
    "it is well known that tokamak performance improves at high elongation and triangularity @xcite ( in large part because this leads to more plasma current at fixed @xmath21 ) , so when designing future tokamaks , one would like to use the highest possible values of elongation and triangularity , though elongation is limited by vertical stability control if it becomes too large .",
    "some initial studies of shaping effects with gs2 were carried out in ref . , using a range of shapes scaled from the particular jet shot @xmath2052979 ( available in the iter profile database @xcite ) .",
    "this jet shot , described in more detail in refs .",
    ", was chosen as a representative h - mode plasma that has been studied in detail by gyrokinetics codes before .",
    "parameters for this paper were chosen from shot @xmath2052979 , but the shaping parameters were scaled to the higher levels achievable in tokamaks .",
    "these values of edge elongation and triangularity are from aries - at , which generally tried to maximize these parameters subject to engineering and vertical stability constraints .",
    "this jet shot has a conventional @xmath21 profile , while the aries - at design study assumed that a reversed shear scenario can be stably maintained in steady state .",
    "the composite tokamak of this paper has a conventional @xmath21 profile .",
    "the miller equilibrium @xcite for this prototypical or generic strongly - shaped tokamak was set up in the following way .    the shaping study in ref",
    ". chose to focus on the radius @xmath22 in order to be fairly near the plasma edge where shaping effects are stronger , but not too far out because because gyrokinetic codes often do not compare well with experiments near the edge ( perhaps because edge turbulence is driven by mechanisms other than itg / tem modes that require higher resolution than usual or additional effects that are not included in present gyrokinetic codes ) .",
    "therefore , the study in this section uses @xmath22 .    just inside the separatrix at the @xmath23 poloidal flux surface ,",
    "the jet shot had an elongation of @xmath24 and triangularity of @xmath25 , while the core elongation is @xmath26 . at the radius of interest , @xmath22 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and",

    "effects that might change this result include finite beta modifications to the equilibrium and the nonlinear dimits shift,@xcite which could increase each critical gradient , but the required nonlinear simulations are beyond the scope of this work .",

    "while from equation [ eqn : coretemp ] it is clear that @xmath1 is the relevant parameter for determining the core temperature , in the axisymmetric community , the threshold for the itg instability is usually expressed in terms of @xmath2 , which is often the key parameter numerically .",

    "therefore , the local value of the logarithmic gradient , @xmath80 is much larger than the average @xmath81 .",
    "this is enhanced by the larger average aspect ratio @xmath82 relative to the tokamak @xmath83 , and is partially compensated by the fact that the local radius of curvature of the magnetic field , @xmath84 ( evaluated at the outer midplane of the @xmath22 flux surface in the left panel of figure [ fig : cross ] ) is somewhat smaller than the average radius of curvature @xmath85 in ncsx .",

    "]    restating this concern , one may have thought that if ncsx and a tokamak had the same normalized temperature gradient , @xmath1 , the itg modes would be much worse in ncsx due to a much higher @xmath78 than the tokamak .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : ncsxaries ] showed that ncsx has a somewhat higher critical gradient in terms of @xmath1 , so the hypothesis that ncsx and a tokamak are similar when expressed in terms of @xmath78 must be incorrect . indeed , this is strikingly illustrated in figure [ fig : ncsxariesrltloc ] ( same data as fig .",
    "[ fig : ncsxaries ] , renormalized ) , which shows that ncsx has in fact much lower growth rates than a tokamak for the same @xmath78 .",
    "this is probably because the parallel dynamics are in fact not negligible in ncsx .",
    "the eigenfunctions , as seen in figure [ fig : ncsxaries_efcns ] , are more localized along a field line in ncsx than in a tokamak , possibly through some combination of the stabilizing effects of a narrower bad - curvature region ( i.e. , a shorter connection length between good and bad curvature regions ) and stronger local magnetic shear .",
    "these effects should be investigated more thoroughly in the future .",
    ", except the x - axis is normalized by the local magnetic field radius of curvature @xmath88 , instead of @xmath9 .",
    "this demonstrates that ncsx ( blue crosses ) performs much better than would be expected if the instability was the same at the same @xmath89 , presumably indicating that additional stabilizing effects in the parallel dynamics are important in ncsx .",

    "this particular tokamak equilibrium is a composite of jet h - mode shot @xmath2052979 and aries - at .",
    "ncsx had a similar linear critical temperature gradient @xmath17 to the tokamak case for itg modes with adiabatic electrons , though its growth rates were higher than the tokamak s beyond marginal stability .",
    "however , for itg modes with kinetic electrons , ncsx s critical gradient @xmath90 is approximately @xmath91 higher than the tokamak s , which would correspond to an approximately @xmath92% increase in the fusion power for ncsx relative to the tokamak .",
    "the growth rates in ncsx remained less than for the tokamak until @xmath93 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is an important figure of merit because it characterizes the core to edge temperature ratio ( if the plasma is near marginal stability as expected in typical hot reactor regimes ) .",
    "while the parameter @xmath94 is often a useful stability parameter in tokamak cases , it was found that stabilizing effects in the parallel dynamics in stellarators can make it a less relevant measure for stellarators . upon rescaling the kinetic itg mode data as a function of @xmath2 , it was found that ncsx appears even more stable .",
    "future work that should be done includes using gs2 s nonlinear capabilities to compare heat fluxes for various fusion energy devices . including more physical effects , such as non - zero density gradients and collisionalities , would create a clearer picture of their relative confinement properties .",
