    "first - principles electronic - structure calculations have made a large contribution to the understanding of materials .",
    "density - functional theory@xcite has proven itself as an extremely versatile and efficient tool to provide quantitative information of real materials .",
    "while a number of open challenges such as strong correlations , embedding of environments , various property calculations remain , much of the methodology has matured and has been implemented into efficient program packages .",
    "the development of electronic - structure methods not only has the goal of _ simulating _ nature , but also aims to develop an _ efficient language _ that allows to describe and rationalize the properties and the behavior of real materials in simple terms .",
    "this second aspect in turn has been an inspiration for the development of algorithms that are efficient on the computer .",
    "both , the pseudopotential approach@xcite and the augmented wave methods @xcite , which have been linked by the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite , stand in this tradition .",
    "the pseudopotential approach emphasizes the free - electron - like features , while the augmented wave methods provide , for example , a sound basis for a tight - binding description of the electronic structure@xcite , which is central to the natural language of chemists .    a central point in discussing the electronic structure",
    "is the separation of the chemical effects of the valence electrons from those of the core electrons .",
    "one can say that augmented wave methods and the pseudopotential approach came to life by providing their own answer to this problem .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a tool to exploit this separation of core and valence states from a different point of view .",
    "this tool is a representation of the atomic wave functions in terms of node - less radial functions .",
    "the node - less wave functions provide a description of the pauli repulsion by the core electrons by an effective potential and thus provides a canonical pseudopotential .",
    "the construction described here , is currently used for the pseudization of wave functions in the paw method , which is analogous to the construction of pseudopotentials .",
    "it is also used for the natural choice of tight - binding orbitals , which will be used to incorporate strong correlations into a dft environment .",
    "the concept of node - less wave functions have been introduced by topiol , zunger and ratner@xcite to construct the first ab - initio pseudopotentials .",
    "the resulting pseudopotentials exhibited a divergent term at the atomic site which was a disadvantage for plane wave calculations . by relaxing the direct connection to the atomic wave function",
    ", the divergent term could be avoided , which lead to the norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite used until today .    in this paper , we extend the concept of zunger et al . by providing a construction that provides direct contact to the underlying physics of the atom .",

    "the radial part of the wave function starts at the origin with a high power of @xmath16 .",
    "the depression of the wave function near the nucleus can be loosely attributed to the pauli repulsion of the core electrons , that repel the valence electrons from the core region .",
    "the leading power of the node - less wave functions near the origin is @xmath17 the leading - order term is derived in appendix  [ sec : powerorigin ] .",
    "the exponential function with the yet unspecified parameter @xmath18 has been added , because it provides a good description of the qualitative behavior of the wave function over a fairly wide region near the origin .",
    "[ eq : leadingpoweru ] shows that node - reduced partial waves start out at the origin with a increasingly high power , as @xmath19 is increased .",
    "we found it surprising that no trace of the nodal structure is left near the origin .",
    "now , we introduce energy - dependent partial waves via the differential equation @xmath20 we will call them _ node - reduced partial waves _ , because their number of nodes is @xmath21 less than that of the regular partial wave @xmath0 at the same energy .",
    "this construction allows one to effectively remove the core states from the shape of the wave function and from the scattering properties .",
    "the boundary conditions at the origin of the node - reduced partial waves are chosen analogously to those for @xmath14 , namely @xmath22 @xmath23 is identical to the regular energy - dependent partial wave @xmath0 with the normalization from eq .",

    "[ eq : qsequence ] , we can construct all @xmath26 from the energy - dependent partial wave @xmath0 , if the latter is normalized such that the leading term at the origin remains energy - independent .",

    "[ eq : psiofefromqofe ] sheds some light on the question of the node - less - ness of the wave function @xmath14 :    we will show later , that the assumptions of the nodal theorem for the node - reduced wave functions is violated in the scattering region . nevertheless , the assumptions are valid in the energy region of bound states .",
    "it is our hope that a variant of the nodal theorem can be found that holds for the entire energy region .",

    "thus the number of nodes increases by one at each energy @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "we can also exclude that nodes leave the interval at the center , because the leading order of the taylor expansion about the origin is , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : qofen ] , energy independent .",
    "if a node would migrate across the origin , the leading order of @xmath39 would change sign in contradiction to eq .",

    "thus , for reasonable assumptions , these arguments show that the bound wave functions are free of nodes . in the scattering region at high energies though , the assumptions made are violated .",

    "a second difficulty of constructing pseudo wave function is to avoid artificial core - like states .",
    "they can be induced by the proximity to semi - core states that are excluded from the valence shell . because the pole of the logarithmic wave function of these states may be noticeable , the pseudized wave functions try to reproduce this pole resulting in artificial undesired states . when the node - reduced wave functions are used as basis for the construction of the pseudo - potential ,",
