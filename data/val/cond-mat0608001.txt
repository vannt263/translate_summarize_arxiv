    "metallic electrons confined to one dimension exhibit a plethora of intriguing effects , driven by interactions and the coupling to impurities and defects @xcite . at low energies a clean system is described by the concept of a spinful _ luttinger liquid _ ( ll ) @xcite , with properties very different from those of a fermi liquid : the quasiparticle pole vanishes identically and only collective modes remain , separately carrying spin and charge .",
    "the response of an ll to the addition of a local potential scatterer also differs dramatically from that of a fermi liquid : the repulsive electron - electron interaction produces long - range density oscillations that get tangled up with the impurity potential in such a way as to suppress the single - electron spectral weight close to the impurity , as well as the conductance through it @xcite : in the zero - temperature limit and with a spin - rotational invariant interaction the impurity effectively cuts the system in two parts , with ",
    "open  boundaries ( hard walls ) replacing the impurity .",
    "the case of a magnetic impurity @xmath0 which interacts dynamically with the conduction electrons @xmath0 is similar : in the zero - temperature limit the physics is that of two lls separated by open boundaries , with the finite-@xmath1 response governed by a scaling operator that tunnels electrons through the boundaries @xcite .",
    "the pictures that emerge in both cases are universal in the sense that all response functions depend only on the electron - electron interaction , with critical exponents which for a spin - rotational interaction is coded by the single ll _",
    "charge parameter _ @xmath2 .",
    "details of the coupling of the electrons to the impurity , or the structure of the impurity potential , are irrelevant .",
    "the fact that an impurity in an ll drives the system to an _ open boundary fixed point _",
    "@xcite has spurred considerable theoretical work on properties of lls with an open boundary condition ( obc ) @xcite . added interest comes from the fact that many measurements on one - dimensional electron structures @xmath0 such as the single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) @xcite , or quantum wires , realized in gated semiconductor heterostructures @xcite or grown on metallic substrates @xcite @xmath0",
    "are expected to be significantly influenced by electron scattering from the edges , where the confining potential to a first approximation can be treated as an obc .",
    "most work to date has focused on the _ local spectral weight _ ( lsw ) of an ll with an obc , yielding predictions for single - electron tunneling and photoemission measurements close to an edge @xcite or close to an impurity at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .",
    "measuring the energy @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) with respect to the fermi level , the low - temperature lsw @xmath5 close to an open boundary scales as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 for a repulsive electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with that of a clean system probed away from its edges , where @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "experiments on swcnts seem to agree with the theoretical prediction that the tunneling rate of electrons should follow a characteristic power law with temperature @xcite , with a significant reduction of tunneling into the end of a tube as compared to tunneling into its interior (  bulk  regime ) @xcite .",
    "oscillation patterns that suggest spin - charge separation have also been seen in the tunneling conductance between two quantum wires produced by cleaved edge overgrowth @xcite , in qualitative agreement with theoretical results . in another line of research ,",
    "photoemission spectroscopy measurements on quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors have been interpreted within a picture where the one - dimensional chains in the samples are cut by impurities into disconnected pieces , each modeled as an ll with obcs . again using results for the lsw ,",
    "it has been argued @xcite that this approach gives better agreement with experiments than conventional theory where photoemission spectra are compared to predictions from ordinary `` bulk '' ll theory @xcite . however , this alternative interpretation remains controversial and the issue has been difficult to settle , much due to the fact that photoemission measurements on these materials are subject to a variety of subtle effects .    the most direct way to probe an lsw is via scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "these experiments are delicate , as the stm tip must be positioned at a very small distance from the sample for electrons to tunnel @xcite .",
    "while this is feasible for swcnts , the high - precision stm experiments that have been carried out have probed tubes deposited on metallic substrates .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the electron - electron interaction from screening charges , and early results were successfully interpreted within a free electron model @xcite . in another effort",
    "stm measurements were performed on swcnts freely suspended over a trench @xcite , thus bypassing the problem with screening charges . however , the resolution achieved in this experiment was not sufficient to test for the expected ll scaling at small energies . in more recent experiments swcnts deposited on atomically clean au(111 )",
    "surfaces were studied by high - resolution stm spectroscopy @xcite , revealing that the electronic standing waves close to the end of a tube have en enhanced charge velocity which may imply spin - charge separation , and _ a fortiori _ ll behavior @xcite .",
    "turning to theory , the spectral properties of lls with obcs are by now fairly well understood , although some open problems remain .",
    "maybe most pressing is the question about the very applicability of ll theory : what is the energy scale @xmath9 below which the power law in eq .",
    "( [ powerlawboundary ] ) becomes visible ? obviously , an answer to this question is essential for making sensible predictions for experiments . from numerical and other studies of the one - dimensional hubbard model @xcite it is known that the decrease of the lsw @xmath0 as predicted by ll theory @xmath0 is often preceded by a sharp increase , and that this effect is particularly pronounced near an edge @xcite or close to an impurity @xcite .",
    "the effect is expected to be generic for any one - dimensional metallic system where the amplitude for back - scattering is larger than for forward scattering .",
    "for some systems with a ( weakly screened ) long - range interaction , such as the carbon nanotubes , back - scattering gets suppressed above a threshold temperature , and one expects the asymptotic ll scaling in eq .",
    "( [ powerlawboundary ] ) to be visible at accessible energy scales , as is also suggested by experiments @xcite .",
    "more work is needed , though , to obtain a reliable estimate of the crossover scale @xmath9 , given data from the underlying microscopic physics .",
    "we shall not address this issue here , but rather revisit the problem of determining the full coordinate- and temperature dependence of the lsw of one - dimensional interacting electrons with an obc , assuming that the energy scale is sufficiently low for ll theory to be applicable . knowing the detailed structure of the lsw is important for making predictions of future high - precision stm measurements of ll systems , of which the swcnts are presently the prime candidates @xcite . in earlier works the zero - temperature properties of the lsw @xcite , as well as the finite temperature properties of the uniform part of the lsw ( neglecting friedel oscillations ) @xcite ,",
    "have been reported . here",
    "we treat the full problem at a finite temperature and exhibit the lsw for different choices of interaction strength and band filling .",
    "we shall find that close to an open boundary the line shape of the lsw has a marked asymmetry as a function of energy with respect to the fermi level , a property that arises from the phases that appear in the single - electron green s function , and which has not been examined before .",
    "the form of the asymmetry in the neighborhood of the fermi level resembles a fano line shape , a feature expected universally whenever a resonant state ( like that induced by a magnetic impurity in an electron system ) interferes with a non - resonant one @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the origin of the asymmetric line shape in the present case is very different , and is formed by an interplay between electron - electron interaction and scattering off the open boundary .",
    "the asymmetry is fairly robust against thermal effects , suggesting that fano - like line shapes produced by the reflection of interacting electrons off boundaries can be observed at temperatures higher than those originating from their interference with a resonating level .",
    "having access to the full lsw we will also be able to give a systematic description of how charge- and spin separation shows up as an oscillation pattern when being close to an edge ( or , an impurity , at low temperatures ) .",
    "this information , which we extract for different temperatures , can be directly translated into a prediction of the measured differential conductance when probing an ll system by stm .",
    "also , given the full lsw we derive its crossover from boundary to thermal scaling near the fermi level .",
    "the thermal effects soften the power law singularities of the lsw , since the non - chiral terms in the electron greens s function produce a leading scaling term that is linear in energy at higher temperatures .",
    "this softening should not be confused with the averaging effects that always occur when the experimental tunneling currents are calculated by integrating over the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we review some basics about temperature - dependent local spectral weights and stm currents . in sec .",
    "iii we derive an exact representation of the local spectral weight for a luttinger liquid with an open boundary , paying due attention to the phase dependence that has not been examined in earlier studies . in this section",
    "we also show how to adapt the theory for applications to scanning tunneling microscopy of swcnts .",

    "in order to calculate tunneling currents e.g.  from an stm tip we will consider the transition rate of adding electrons to an ll system at a position @xmath11 and with energy @xmath3 , @xmath12 this expression follows from fermi s golden rule assuming a tunneling hamiltonian of the form @xmath13 , and treating the tip as a reservoir with unit probability that an electron is available for tunneling . here",

    "in fact , the result which we derive in the next section , using bosonization , reveals a surprising asymmetric energy dependence of the lsw close to the fermi level for a semi - infinite ll with an open boundary condition ( obc ) .    before taking on this task ,",
    "let us recall how scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) is used to experimentally probe the lsw close to edges and impurities . in the simplest approach , when the stm tip is assumed to couple only to the conduction electrons ( thus neglecting tunneling into localized impurity levels ) the tunneling current is given by the integrated difference between the transition rates @xmath32 and @xmath33 , weighted by the corresponding probabilities that an electron [ hole ] is available in the tip for tunneling to [ from ] the sample . with an applied voltage @xmath34 one thus has : @xmath35   d \\omega \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & 2 \\pi e",

    "it is clear that we recover the conventional formula for tunneling at zero temperature @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the local single - electron density of states for a conduction electron in the sample , and @xmath37 is the density of states of the stm tip measured relative to the fermi energy . by differentiating , the local differential tunneling conductance can then be directly related to the local density of states in eq . ( [ i ] )",
    "@xmath41 this expression remains valid at a finite temperature @xmath1 , provided that the thermal length @xmath42 is larger than any other characteristic length @xmath43 of the experimental setup ( such as the distance between the stm tip and the edge of the sample ) .",
    "the speed @xmath44 that determines @xmath45 is that of the spin collective modes ( which in a one - dimensional interacting electron system are slower than the collective charge modes ) .",
