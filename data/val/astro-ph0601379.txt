    "observations of quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo s ) in the x - ray light curves of black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries have motivated the theory of relativistic `` diskoseismology '' , the study of hydrodynamic oscillation modes of geometrically thin accretion discs ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "standing waves with discrete frequencies can exist in such discs because the radial profiles of general relativistic test particle oscillation frequencies can create finite regions where modes are trapped . because the disc is considered to be geometrically thin",
    ", radial pressure gradients are usually negligible in the equilibrium structure of the accretion flow , which is presumed to consist of fluid rotating on nearly circular geodesics",
    ".    however , radial pressure gradients themselves can permit the existence of discrete modes because they produce a disc , or torus , of finite extent . at least in the case of black hole x - ray binaries , qpo s are only observed in the `` hard '' and `` steep power law '' spectral / variability states ( e.g. @xcite ) , states in which the flow is not solely composed of a standard geometrically thin accretion disc .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that radial pressure gradients may be important in trapping modes , and various groups have recently explored the possibility that accretion tori may explain observed qpo s , e.g. @xcite for low frequency qpo s , @xcite for high frequency qpo s . geometrically thick tori may form in stellar collapse , and modes of dense tori around black holes have also been suggested as a detectable source of gravitational waves ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a complete analysis of the spectrum of modes in tori has not yet been done except in the limiting case of constant specific angular momentum , slender tori in a newtonian point mass gravitational potential @xcite . in this paper",
    "we greatly generalize that early work and present a rather complete analysis of the oscillation modes of non - self - gravitating , polytropic , hydrodynamic tori with small cross - section and arbitrary specific angular momentum distributions .",
    "the torus equilibria are assumed to be stationary and axisymmetric , and orbit in an arbitrary background spacetime which is itself axisymmetric and possesses reflection symmetry .",
    "although limited to slender tori , our work here could be numerically extended to thicker tori by tracking all the mode frequencies .",
    "armed with a complete understanding of all the mode frequencies and their physical properties , it should be possible to better identify what modes might be responsible for observed qpo s .",
    "an analysis of torus oscillation modes is also useful as a code check for global numerical simulations of accretion flows . in part because of their finite spatial resolution , these simulations generally use tori rather than geometrically thin discs as initial conditions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that global simulations of non - radiative , magnetized accretion flows often produce small , albeit highly variable , hot inner tori near the innermost stable circular orbit @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the basic equations describing the equilibria and linear perturbations of relativistic slender tori .",
    "we then make some general remarks about the types of modes and their classification in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present complete solutions for all the modes of relativistic fluid tori in four special cases where this can be done analytically .",
    "then in section 5 we show how the low order modes of the general torus can be derived exactly , and also present numerical solutions for higher order modes .",
    "in section 6 we compare these analytic results with numerical simulations of oscillating hydrodynamic tori , and we finally summarize our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "readers who are primarily interested in applications to qpo s should focus on sections 5 and 7 .",
    "there we identify a robust new candidate for the modes comprising the observed 3:2 ratio of high frequency qpo s in black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "we apply our analytic results for these mode frequencies to gro  j1655 - 40 in figure 9 .",
    "we remind the reader that slender hydrodynamic tori are violently unstable to the papaloizou - pringle instability @xcite .",
    "perhaps even more important , in the presence of a weak magnetic field , they are unstable to the development of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence due to the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "whether or not the hydrodynamic modes we discuss here can survive these instabilities or even exist is a problem which still needs to be investigated , and we discuss this briefly in section 7 .",
    "we consider an ideal , hydrodynamic flow in a stationary , axisymmetric spacetime with reflection symmetry .",
    "the line element may be expressed as @xmath0 we take the metric to have signaure @xmath1 . because of the assumed symmetries , the metric coefficients @xmath2 depend on @xmath3 and @xmath4 only , and remain unchanged under the transformation @xmath5 .",
    "we will restrict consideration throughout this paper to flows which are isentropic , and in fact polytropic .",
    "hence the internal energy per unit volume @xmath6 ( including rest mass ) , pressure @xmath7 , and rest mass density @xmath8 , all measured in the fluid rest frame , are related by @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the polytropic index and @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "we use units where @xmath12 here and throughout this paper .",

    "this extremum is of course located at the pressure maximum @xmath26 .",
    "linear perturbations of a test particle about this circular geodesic lead to radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations .",

    "@xcite have shown that the resulting perturbation equations can then be combined into a single , second order partial differential equation in terms of a single scalar perturbation variable .",
    "in order to follow the notation of recent work on oscillations of tori @xcite , we define this variable slightly differently as @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "we denote this scalar variable by @xmath60 , as this was the notation first used in the original newtonian study of global instabilities of tori @xcite .",
    "the perturbation equation for tori could be derived by changing variables and taking the appropriate limit of the general equation of @xcite , but we sketch the direct derivation here in order to include some intermediate results which will be useful .",

    "it is important to note that they are , necessarily , _",
    "identical _ in mathematical form to the corresponding equations for a polytropic slender torus in a newtonian gravitational potential with axisymmetry and reflection symmetry .",
    "all the interesting effects boil down to three characteristic frequencies : the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath39 , the vertical epicyclic frequency @xmath40 , and the characteristic frequency of inertial modes at the pressure maximum @xmath75 .",
    "the slender torus always admits a trivial zero velocity , zero corotating frequency mode , with @xmath60 being independent of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and @xmath76 . in the constant specific angular momentum case",
    ", this is the mode which corresponds to the principal mode of the papaloizou - pringle instability when the torus has finite thickness @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the slender torus ( even in the baroclinic case ) also always admits incompressible modes corresponding to global oscillations of the entire torus at the epicyclic frequencies of the external spacetime : @xmath77 and @xmath78 the fluid velocity for these modes is spatially constant over a torus cross - section .",
    "broadly speaking , the remaining modes are of three general types : surface gravity waves , internal inertial waves , and acoustic waves .",
    "the last two classes are easily revealed in a wkb analysis of equation ( [ eqwpde ] ) .",

    "this dispersion relation immediately gives two solutions describing the high wavenumber behavior for acoustic and inertial waves : @xmath84 respectively .",
    "this justifies our claim that @xmath85 is the characteristic frequency of inertial oscillations in the fluid .    according to the equilibrium equation ( [ eqf ] ) , surfaces of constant density and pressure have perfectly elliptical cross - section in @xmath86 coordinates .",
    "the slender torus equilibrium is therefore perfectly reflection - symmetric about @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "all the slender torus modes can therefore be assigned a definite parity with respect to each of these reflections , and we note these parities throughout the rest of the paper . in general , thicker tori remain reflection symmetric about the equatorial plane , and so modes will continue to have a definite @xmath89parity .",
    "a well - defined @xmath90parity only exists in the slender torus limit , however .",
    "in addition to the parities , we will also label modes with non - negative integer quantum numbers @xmath91 and @xmath92 which are derived from the extreme limits of a constant specific angular momentum slender torus in a newtonian point mass potential and a general slender torus with an incompressible equation of state @xmath93 .",
    "these limits are discussed in sections 4.1 and 4.3 below .",
    "physically , @xmath94 modes have an acoustic character , and have frequencies which diverge in the incompressible limit .",
    "increasing @xmath91 and @xmath92 corresponds to shorter spatial scales of variation in the mode eigenfunction on a torus cross - section .",
    "the tori we are analyzing in this paper are violently unstable @xcite .",
    "this instability is not captured by our equations , because its growth rate happens to vanish in the slender torus limit .",
    "however , for tori of finite thickness , the corotation mode becomes the principal mode of the papaloizou - pringle instability @xcite .",
    "in addition , the slender torus limit loses the corotation and lindblad resonances normally associated with nonaxisymmetric spiral waves in discs .",
    "there are four special cases where a complete solution to the mode spectrum of the slender torus can be derived analytically .      in a newtonian @xmath95 potential ,",
    "the two epicyclic frequencies are both degenerate with the orbital angular velocity : @xmath96 .",
    "if in addition the torus has constant specific angular momentum , then @xmath97 and equation ( [ eqf ] ) implies that isobaric surfaces have circular cross - section in the variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 . by changing variables",

    "the @xmath105 , @xmath106 modes correspond to the global radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations of the entire torus , which in this case have frequencies that are degenerate with the orbital angular velocity .",

    "a specific angular momentum distribution which is at the opposite extreme to that just considered is a `` keplerian '' distribution , where every fluid element in the slender torus has the same specific angular momentum as that of a circular geodesic in the equatorial plane . in this case",

    "in addition , we find that all other modes , apart from the trivial corotation mode , have frequencies which approach the radial epicyclic frequency .",

    "the prominent peaks at @xmath182 and @xmath183 in figure [ fig : fragile1 ] are likely not true oscillation modes .",
    "the nonlinear interaction of two waves with frequencies @xmath184 and @xmath185 , if not forbidden by selection rules ( parity , etc . ) , will produce modulation at  combination frequencies \" @xmath186 .",
    "the three peaks may then be explained as @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , we find numerically that there is a higher order even - even parity mode with frequency @xmath190 , implying a near resonance with @xmath191 .",
    "lastly , we note that there is a chance near resonance @xmath192 . in the slender torus , this interaction",
    "is forbidden by the parity selection rule for the radial direction . however , this parity rule is strictly valid only for the infinitely slender torus , and may still occur in our numerical simulations .     for a torus with @xmath178 .",
    "each of the eigenfrequencies from table 2 are identified .",
    "the units of the vertical axis are arbitrary , while the horizontal axis has been scaled with the reciprocal of the orbital period at the pressure maximum .",
    "[ fig : fragile1],width=604 ]    , but for a constant specific angular momentum torus with each of the eigenfrequencies from table 4 identified .",
    "[ fig : fragile2],width=604 ]",
    "we have presented a rather complete discussion of the oscillation modes of non - self - gravitating , relativistic , polytropic tori in an arbitrary axisymmetric spacetime with reflection symmetry , in the limit where the tori are very slender .",
    "non - slender torus oscillation modes can be explored numerically , and some work on this has already been done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it would also be possible to examine the behavior of modes for thicker tori analytically using perturbative methods , generalizing the technique employed by @xcite .",
    "all the slender tori considered in this paper are hydrodynamically unstable to the nonaxisymmetric , papaloizou - pringle instability ( ppi ) @xcite .",
    "they would also develop magnetohydrodynamical turbulence in the presence of a weak magnetic field because of the mri @xcite .",
    "almost all simulations examining oscillations of tori , including those presented in this paper , have been axisymmetric and neglected magnetic fields , so both of these instabilities have not been allowed to develop .",
    "a major outstanding issue is therefore which , if any , of the hydrodynamic torus modes survive these instabilities .",
    "a preliminary investigation of this has been done by @xcite , but more work needs to be done .",
    "at least in radially extended tori , the ppi can be suppressed by dynamical accretion through the torus inner edge @xcite . moreover",
    ", the mri appears to dominate the ppi when magnetic fields are included , and generally leads to a near - keplerian distribution of specific angular momentum in the flow @xcite . if modes which are essentially hydrodynamic in nature can exist in the presence of mri turbulence , then the near keplerian limit is therefore probably of most interest .",
    "the turbulence itself may then determine the mode amplitudes , but all of these questions remain to be investigated .",
    "a systematic understanding of all the types of modes which may be present , as we have done in this paper , should aid such investigations .",
    "figure [ fig : sigmavskappa ] shows that all mode families converge to the epicyclic frequencies or vertical sound waves in the keplerian limit .",
    "if physical discs are indeed nearly keplerian , this greatly simplifies seismology as only a few distinct frequencies exist . but how close are real discs to the keplerian limit ?",
    "equation ( 8) can be rewritten in terms of the angular momentum gradient for keplerian motion , @xmath193 , by differentiating equation ( 6 ) and substituting into equation ( 8) .",
    "the result is exactly the same as for @xmath194 in equation ( 16 ) , with @xmath195 , the angular momentum gradient for the fluid torus , replaced by @xmath193 .",
    "the difference of these two quantities becomes @xmath196 which manifestly goes to zero in the keplerian limit .",
    "@xcite present plots of @xmath197 and @xmath198 ( averaged against density over spherical shells ) against radius for mri driven accretion onto kerr black holes . in the region of the  inner torus \" ( see their figure 3 )",
    ", they find @xmath198 has a similar slope as @xmath197 , but is smaller by @xmath199 , the difference going to zero at the marginally stable orbit . using equation [ eq : diff ] , this implies @xmath200 in our notation .",
    "hence figure 2 shows that low order modes should be quite accurately described by the keplerian limit , while the deviation from the keplerian limit increases with number of nodes .",
    "for emission from an optically thick region , flux variations from the photosphere become smaller as more angular nodes are included due to averaging of hot and cold spots .",
    "hence low order modes , which are more nearly in the keplerian limit , are also likely more observable .    in view of this , the lowest order breathing mode / vertical acoustic wave and the vertical epicyclic mode may be an attractive candidate for a pair of modes which have a near 3:2 commensurability for radiation pressure - dominated ( @xmath151 ) tori , as this persists in the keplerian limit .",
    "this is in contrast to the plus mode and radial epicyclic mode pair , whose frequency ratio approaches unity in the keplerian limit . identifying the vertical epicyclic mode with the lower of the two observed frequencies also allows the black holes to have any spin parameter , in contrast to the case where the lower of the two frequencies is identified as the radial epicyclic mode .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : nuepi1655 ] for the case of gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "this source has a mass of @xmath201  m@xmath202 @xcite , and models which identify the 300  hz qpo as the axisymmetric radial epicyclic mode require @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "the same is true for diskoseismology models which identify the 300  hz qpo with an axisymmetric `` @xmath204-mode '' , which has a frequency below the radial epicyclic frequency within the mode trapping region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is in conflict with recent continuum spectral fitting results which suggest a lower black hole spin @xcite .",
    "if the 300  hz qpo is instead the axisymmetric vertical epicyclic mode , any spin is possible .",
    "many other mode pairs would probably also work , especially if we consider nonaxisymmetric ( @xmath159 ) modes .",
    "however , one still needs to explain why the qpo s occur at the actual observed frequencies , i.e. what singles out a preferred radius for the torus in this source .",
    "more work needs to be done to investigate how torus oscillation modes might manifest themselves in x - ray light curves and power spectra .",
    "some work has been done based on tracking photon geodesics from the torus to the observer @xcite , but additional work needs to be done on the photon emission mechanism of the tori themselves .",
    "the difficulties that some diagnostics have in identifying torus oscillation modes in numerical simulations , even when they are present in the initial conditions as discussed in section 6 above , should serve as a warning to numericists searching for qpo s in their simulations .",
    "the x - ray observations generally have nothing to do with these diagnostics .",
    "it remains unclear whether tori are appropriate models for the flow geometry for the `` steep power law state '' @xcite where high frequency qpo s are seen in black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "@xcite suggest that the steep power law state consists of a standard geometrically thin disc sandwiched between a magnetized corona which has sucked up much of the accretion power out of the disc .",
    "oscillation modes that are analogous to the torus modes with vertical reflection symmetry _ might _ exist in such a magnetized corona , because the vertical velocities vanish in the equatorial plane , where the high inertia disc is located .",
    "we hope that our comprehensive hydrodynamic mode analysis may act as a foundation for investigation of these and the other questions noted above .    ,",
    "appropriate for gro j1655 - 40 , and various black hole spins @xmath205 as labelled .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines indicate the frequencies of the observed high frequency qpo s in this source .",
    "models which identify the 300 hz qpo as the axisymmetric radial epicyclic mode require @xmath203 .",
    "dotted lines show the lowest order breathing mode frequency for the same black hole spins and both constant specific angular momentum tori and tori in the keplerian limit .",
    "models which identify the 300 hz qpo with the vertical epicyclic mode and the 450 hz qpo with the breathing mode can work for any spin .",
