    "it is a well known property of bose - einstein condensates with attractive interatomic interactions that stationary solutions to the gross - pitaevskii equation exist only in certain regions of the parameter space governing the physics of the condensates .",
    "for example , for the case of an attractive s - wave contact interaction it was theoretically predicted ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and experimentally confirmed @xcite , that the condensate collapses when , for given negative scattering length , the number of particles becomes too large . in an alternative experiment @xcite the collapse",
    "was induced by tuning the scattering length in the vicinity of feshbach resonances by adjusting an external magnetic field .",
    "huepe et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the critical parameter values where collapse occurs in fact correspond to bifurcation points of the solutions to the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation and analyzed the linear stability of the solutions .",
    "quite recently it was demonstrated @xcite that similar behavior persists in bose - einstein condensates where , in addition to the short - range ( van der waals - like ) interaction a long - range `` gravity - like '' , attractive @xmath0 interaction is present .",
    "such monopolar quantum gases could be realized according to odell et al .",
    "@xcite by a combination of 6 appropriately arranged `` triads '' of intense off - resonant laser beams . there ,",
    "too , when crossing the borderlines in the parameter space , spanned by particle number , scattering length and trap frequency , at which a stationary ground state of the extended gross - pitaevskii equation comes into being , a second , excited , state of the condensate is born in a tangent bifurcation .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to examine these bifurcations from the point of view of the theory of `` exceptional points '' , since at the bifurcation points both the eigenvalues and the wave functions of the two states are identical , a situation well known from studies of exceptional points @xcite , which have been investigated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in a wide variety of physical systems .",
    "exceptional points can appear in systems described by non - hermitian matrices which depend on a two - dimensional parameter space . at critical points in the parameter space ( exceptional points ) a coalescence of two eigenstates can occur , where _ both _ the eigenvalues _ and _ the eigenvectors of the two states pass through a branch point singularity and become identical .",
    "there is only one linearly independent eigenvector of the two states at the exceptional point .    in the quantum mechanics of linear schrdinger equations ,",
    "exceptional points are investigated in open systems in which resonances exist .",
    "examples are discussed , e.g. , for complex atoms in laser fields @xcite , a double @xmath1 well @xcite , the scattering of a beam of particles by a double barrier potential @xcite , and the hydrogen atom in static external fields @xcite .",
    "the existence of resonances is important for the occurrence of exceptional points in quantum systems because the coalescence of two eigenstates is not possible in the case of hermitian hamiltonians describing bound states . in the latter case",
    ", there is always a set of orthogonal eigenstates which never become identical .",
    "the situation is different for resonances , which can , e.g. , be described by _",
    "non_-hermitian hamiltonians . in this case , the eigenstates have not to be orthogonal and a coalescence can occur .",
    "in this paper we will reveal the existence of exceptional points also in quantum systems described by _ nonlinear _ schrdinger equations . as a model system we choose bose - einstein condensates with attractive @xmath0-interaction and concentrate on the case of self trapping , i.e. , condensation without external trap , which is a feature of such systems @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the bifurcations of the two stationary solutions to the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation at critical physical parameter values exhibit the typical structure known from studies of exceptional points in linear systems .",
    "we should point out that the effect is not restricted to condensates with @xmath0-interaction .",
    "our model system has the great advantage that simple approximate analytic solutions exist , which can be used for the investigation of the exceptional points .",
