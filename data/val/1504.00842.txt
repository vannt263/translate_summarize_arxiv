    "the cosmological constant problem regards the huge discrepancy between natural theoretical value and the observed value .",
    "while quantum field theory predicts a huge value ( of the order of the planck scale ) , the observed value is consistent with that of the dark energy , which is more than 120 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "this problem has already been discussed in literature in the context of a nonminimally coupled scalar field , and it was observed that the mechanism works , but the price to pay is that the effective gravitational coupling constant goes to zero , which is not acceptable  @xcite . in this",
    "we point out that this is indeed the case when one considers the problem in the jordan frame . however , the analysis in the einstein frame warrants further investigation , and that is precisely what we do here .    in section  [ jordan frame analysis ]",

    ", one must not mess up with any of the processes in the early universe that are known to work .",
    "these include : nucleosynthesis , photon decoupling and the growth of large scale structure ( not enough is known about inflation , baryogenesis , dark matter production , neutrino decoupling , and cosmic neutrino background to place meaningful constraints on our model ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis and photon decoupling remains unaffected by the scenario considered here , because in the tight coupling limit discussed in section  [ adding matter fields ] , case a , both the effective cosmological constant @xmath85 and matter density scale in the einstein frame as free matter does ; for example @xmath183 and @xmath184 for relativistic and nonrelativistic fluids , respectively .",
    "the tight coupling regime in section  [ adding matter fields ] means that the cosmological constant contribution @xmath85 and matter @xmath172 remain in balance throughout the history of the universe ( from the moment the tight coupling approximation holds ) . during that time the scalar field @xmath8 incessantly decays into matter .",
    "the decay channel must remain open up to late times , which means that @xmath8 must decay ( not only ) into baryons and leptons of the standard model , but also to ( almost ) massless particles such as photons and massless scalars ( which must be therefore chosen outside the standard model ) .",
    "if one produces primarily photons , their energy will redshift fine ( during matter era ) , but one will be able to see this as a faint diffuse background source of very long wavelength stochastic photon radiation which , when included , will increase the photon - to - baryon ratio , leading thus to a potentially observable phenomena .",
    "if the decaying product is an ultralight scalar outside the standard model , its energy density will redshift as radiation , and at the moment we do not see how one would observe it .    as regards the growth of structure , since background matter evolves according to the standard law , @xmath185 , where @xmath186 and @xmath187 , matter perturbations will perceive the einstein frame hubble rate , @xmath188 , and thus grow in the same way as in the standard (",
    "minimally coupled ) cosmology . at late times ( after nucleosynthesis , at which @xmath189 ) the production of electrons , baryons or even neutrinos is kinematically forbidden , and hence the effective cosmological constant decays can not affect the growth of structure .",
    "these remarks imply that in our model we expect the same growth of structure as in the standard @xmath25cdm model .",
    "note that our model does not violate the weinberg s no go theorem  @xcite for the following reasons .",
    "strictly speaking , weinberg s theorem applies to static situations , in which one seeks a solution to the cosmological constant by adjusting the scalar field value to a suitable constant , and the corresponding metric is also time independent , while in our model both the scalar field and the metric are dynamical .",
    "further criticism of the scalar field adjustment mechanisms in  @xcite refers to the observation that any adjustment mechanism implies in the jordan frame an effective newton constant that asymptotically vanishes in time .",
    "we address this issue by postulating that the observers ( us ) perceive the universe expansion in the einstein frame , in which the effective newton constant does not change in time .    at the end",

    "namely , we know that the einstein frame potentials , ( 1 ) @xmath228 with @xmath229 and @xmath230 with @xmath231 could be used to get a sufficiently fast scaling of @xmath85 with time to suppress the effective einstein frame cosmological constant . indeed , in the former case we have @xmath232 and in the latter case the energy density averaged over an oscillation cycle will scale as , @xmath233  @xcite , such that @xmath234 when @xmath231 .",

    "one can try to repair the problem by adding a constant to @xmath197 and still keeping the coefficient of the @xmath198 term negative .",

    "in this appendix we consider some simple decay channel candidates , to see if one can get a growing @xmath157 .",

    "to be kinematically allowed , @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is the effective @xmath177 mass that corresponds to that decay channel .",
    "thus we have the following conditions , @xmath271 which can not be satisfied since @xmath272 ( due to the evolution ) and @xmath273 ( because gravity must be in its perturbative regime ) .    therefore , we need to look harder for an interaction that works .",
    "one possible way out is to admit non - canonical couplings .",
    "taking , for example , @xmath274 in  ( [ typical interactions : einstein frame:2 ] ) results in the photon effective cubic coupling , @xmath275 .",

    "one can show that attempting to introduce a power - law nonminimal coupling into the yukawa and @xmath284 interaction does not open any kinematically allowed decay channel .",
    "but can we construct a decay with canonical couplings that works ?",
    "let us consider the following simple bilinear lagrangian density , @xmath285 when the cubic interaction is extracted , one gets a decay , @xmath286 , but this channel has a very small ( classically zero ) phase space , and hence we shall neglect it . on the other hand , @xmath8 will constantly convert into @xmath177 through the bi - linear coupling term ( mass oscillations ) . in flat space these ( neutrino - like ) mass oscillations",
    "do not induce any decays , because they are reversible ( formally , the decay rate for that process is zero ) .",
    "however , in an expanding universe , the created @xmath177 particles are massless , and their energy density redshifts as @xmath287 ( the corresponding @xmath3 ) , such that the process is not any more reversible : more energy gets transferred from @xmath8 into @xmath177 than _ v.v _ , and one effectively gets a decay .",
