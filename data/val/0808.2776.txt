    "our purpose in this short review is to summarize some of the recent progress in the study of black hole solutions in higher dimensional classical general relativity .",
    "there are already several excellent reviews of complementary aspects of this constantly growing subject .",
    "these include [ ] and [ ]",
    ". our goal here will be a more modest one  to provide an illustration of some of the key lessons in this field , outline some of the most interesting future directions and equip the reader with a first guide to the literature .",
    "we will focus on stationary black holes solutions in pure einstein gravity with simple kaluza - klein or flat minkowski space asymptotics .",
    "this is a minimal setup , which one can envision extending in many different directions , @xmath0 change the asymptotics , add more fields , more charges , supersymmetry @xmath1 despite the apparent simplicity of our setup ( indeed solutions in this setup will be classified by a small number of asymptotic charges ) , we will discover that by changing the spacetime dimension a rich pattern of interconnecting phases with different horizon topology and stability properties arises .",
    "classical general relativity in four spacetime dimensions has an obvious motivation : we live in an observably four - dimensional world .",
    "why then venture into a different dimension ?",
    "there are several good reasons for that :    * string theory contains gravity and typically requires more than four dimensions .",
    "in fact , spacetime dimension itself is a dynamical concept in string theory .",
    "string theory may not have proven itself as the true theory of the nature so far , but it has had considerable success in explaining the microscopic degrees of freedom of black holes .",
    "the first successful statistical counting of black hole entropy was performed for a five - dimensional black hole [ ] . *",
    "the ads / cft correspondence relates a gravitational theory on asymptotically ads spaces in @xmath2 dimensions to a non - gravitational quantum field theory ( qft ) in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "black holes in this context are useful for the analysis of the finite temperature properties of the qft . *",
    "if large extra dimensions [ ] are realized in nature , higher dimensional black holes may arise as important physical objects with observable signatures in accelerators or in the universe ( for a review see [ ] ) .    besides any potential applications classical general relativity in higher dimensions has an interest of its own . as we change the number of spacetime dimensions we discover new features with no counterpart in lower dimensions .",
    "the appearance of some differences is perhaps expected .",
    "after all , by increasing the number of spacetime dimensions we increase the number of degrees of freedom of the graviton and it is natural to expect that the theory will become more versatile . what is interesting to distinguish are precisely those properties of the theory that are dimension - dependent .",
    "in the following sections , we will encounter various instances where the standard lore of pure gravity in four dimensions breaks down as the spacetime dimension increases .",
    "two of the most salient new features that we will encounter are the following .",
    "the solutions of the vacuum einstein equations @xmath4 are constrained by powerful uniqueness theorems in four dimensions .",
    "a black hole is uniquely specified by the adm mass @xmath5 and the angular momentum @xmath6 measured at infinity [ ] . the unique stationary solution is the kerr black hole    [ novelaaa ] @xmath7 @xmath8    @xmath9 is newton s constant . for @xmath10",
    "we recover the unique static black hole solution : the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the generalization of the kerr black hole solution in more than four dimensions is provided by the myers - perry solution [ ] . for a certain range of mass and angular momentum this is not anymore the unique stationary solution .",
    "the first explicit example of this violation of a uniqueness theorem was found by emparan and reall [ ] in five dimensions .",
    "the new solution that does not exist in four dimensions is a black ring , @xmath11 a black hole with horizon topology @xmath12 .",
    "the black ring solution brings forth the violation of another uniqueness theorem that holds in four dimensions : the horizon topology uniqueness theorem . in four dimensions ( with flat space asymptotics ) , one can show on general grounds that the horizon topology is unique . hawking s horizon topology theorem [ ]",
    "states that the integrated ricci scalar over the two - dimensional horizon should be a positive number .",
    "hence , the horizon topology can only be a sphere .",
    "this is no longer the case in more than four dimensions .",
    "generalizations of hawking s horizon topology theorem have been considered in [ ] .",
    "the resulting restrictions on topology turn out to be less restrictive in higher dimensions .",
    "for example , one can show that the horizon must be positive yamabe type , @xmath11 it must be a manifold with an everywhere positive ricci scalar . in five dimensions",
    "the only allowed horizon topologies seem to be @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in six dimensions",
    "many more choices appear to be allowed by topology , @xmath0 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or even @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a two - dimensional riemann surface with genus @xmath19 . in more than six dimensions",
    "even a partial classification of allowed horizon topologies is currently lacking .",
    "another intriguing feature of higher dimensional gravity is the ubiquitous appearance of horizon instabilities and the dynamical transition between phases with different entropy and horizon topology .",
    "an example that arises in various contexts is the gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability [ ] , a long - wavelength instability that arises when the horizon has extended directions . in that case",
    ", the unstable mode evolves towards breaking up the horizon into smaller pieces . the possibility of the formation of a naked singularity during this process points towards a violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "a related feature is the presence of merger points",
    ". these are points in the black hole phase diagrams , where black holes with different horizon topology meet in a topology changing transition .",
    "another interesting property of higher dimensional gravity is the appearance , in some cases , of a critical spacetime dimension , where some properties of the above patterns may change abruptly as we change the dimension .",
    "finally , various bounds that exist in four dimensions ( like the kerr bound @xmath20 ) are lifted in higher dimensions .",
    "it is possible , although not exhibited in full generality , that a dynamical version of these bounds and a new version of black hole uniqueness is reinstated in higher dimensions by demanding stability [ ] .",
    "the issue of perturbative stability becomes more complicated when additional fields , besides the graviton , are present .      the reasons that are responsible for the richness of higher dimensional gravity are also responsible for its complexity and our limited efficiency in uncovering its full breadth of solutions . here",
    "are some of the methods that have been used successfully in this endeavor .",
    "the complexity of the equations can be reduced , in general , by assuming certain symmetries . in such cases , a clever ansatz for the form of the solution , or a clever choice of the coordinate system may simplify the equations considerably .",
    "an example of this strategy is the weyl ansatz [ ] for static and stationary solutions with @xmath21 commuting killing vectors in @xmath22 dimensions .",
    "this method has been used successfully to find exact solutions in five and six - dimensional kaluza - klein ( kk ) spaces , and rotating black ring solutions in five dimensional asymptotically flat space .    in some cases , when an exact solution is known , many more can be generated with methods such as the inverse scattering method [ ] .",
    "this method has been extremely efficient for five - dimensional stationary black hole solutions in flat space .",
    "unfortunately , this method is not as helpful for similar purposes in higher dimensions . for a further solution generating mechanism see [ ] .      in certain cases",
    ", we have no analytic tools to determine the exact solution , but we happen to know the solution is a certain regime of parameters .",
    "then , one may attempt to find the solution with a perturbative expansion around the known limit .",
    "an example of such a method is the matched asymptotic expansion that has been employed succesfully in [ , ] .",
    "this method applies in problems that contain two ( or more ) widely separate scales .",
    "we will review its basic features in section [ phases ] .      when the analytical methods fail , the only way to proceed is by numerical methods . in the context of kk black holes",
    "these techniques have been successfully applied in [ ] for non - uniform black strings and in [ ] for localized black holes ( see section [ kk ] for the definition of these objects ) .",
    "the combination of approximate ( semi - exact ) analytical methods and numerical analysis may be our best bet in generic situations where exact solutions seem out of reach .      in this review we will focus on black hole solutions of the vacuum einstein equations @xmath4 in @xmath23 dimensions .",
    "section [ kk ] reviews the case of kk asymptotics .",
    "section [ phases ] reviews the case of stationary rotating black hole and black ring solutions in flat space with a single angular momentum .",
    "several interesting open problems are summarized in the final section [ final ] .",
    "kaluza - klein black holes will provide our first illustration of the novel features of higher dimensional gravity",
    ". our definition of kaluza - klein black holes in @xmath24 dimensions will be the following : vacuum solutions of the pure gravity einstein equations with at least one event horizon that asymptote at infinity to @xmath3-dimensional minkowski spacetime times a @xmath25-torus @xmath26 .",
    "for concreteness , we will mostly discuss here static and neutral solutions in the @xmath27 ( @xmath11 the @xmath28 ) case .",
    "we will discover that certain aspects of the kk discussion in this section are instrumental in uncovering some of the crucial properties of rotating black holes and black rings in flat space in the next section .",
    "a lengthy review of complementary aspects of the subject presented in this section can be found in [ ] .",
    "for any spacetime which asymptotes to @xmath29 we can define the mass @xmath5 and tension @xmath30 .",
    "these two asymptotic quantities can be used to parametrize the various phases of kk black holes in a @xmath31 phase diagram , which will be defined in a moment .    for any localized static object",
    "the mass and the tension can be determined from the asymptotics of the metric @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",

    "for more details on the gravitational tension of black holes and branes we refer the reader to [ ]",
    ".    it will be convenient to define the following set of dimensionless quantities @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the entropy . for later purposes it will also be useful to define the quantities @xmath42 where @xmath22 is the total spacetime dimension ( here @xmath43 ) .",
    "the program set forth in [ ] is to plot all phases of kaluza - klein black holes in a @xmath31 diagram .",
    "one can show on general grounds [ ] that the relative tension @xmath44 should always lie within the range @xmath45 .",
    "the upper bound follows from the strong energy condition .",
    "the lower bound was found in [ ] .",
    "there are three main types of neutral and static black objects on @xmath34 with a single connected horizon and @xmath46 symmetry  the uniform black string , the non - uniform black string and the localized black holes .",
    "the former two have an event horizon with topology @xmath47 and the latter horizon topology @xmath48 .",
    "all these phases are depicted for @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ figkk ] , which is based on the numerical results of refs .",
    "the most prominent features of this diagram are the following .",
    "* the uniform black string and gregory - laflamme instabilities . *",
    "the metric of the uniform black string solution is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the metric element of a @xmath52-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "this metric is simply the direct sum of the @xmath3-dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini static black hole with an extra flat @xmath53 direction .",
    "this phase has constant relative tension @xmath54 .",
    "a crucial feature of the uniform black string solution is the gregory - laflamme instability ",
    "a long - wavelength instability [ ] associated to a mode that propagates along the direction of the string ( the @xmath53 direction ) and grows exponentially with time .",
    "the instability occurs for any @xmath55 . for @xmath56",
    "the string is believed to be classically stable . for @xmath57",
    "there is a marginal , static mode which signals the emergence of a new branch of black string solutions that are non - uniform along the circle .",
    "an analytic formula for the gregory - laflamme mass @xmath58 is not known .",
    "numerical estimates can be found in [ ] and are summarized in [ ] . a large @xmath3 analytical expression was derived in [ ] .    *",
    "the non - uniform black string , the localized black hole and a merger . * the new non - uniform branch emanating at @xmath58 ( the blue line in fig .",
    "[ figkk ] ) has the same horizon topology as the uniform black string @xmath47 , but a smaller relative tension @xmath59 .",
    "the analytic form of the non - uniform black string is not known .",
    "perturbatively around @xmath58 one finds that the relative tension behaves as @xmath60 the qualitative behavior of the non - uniform branch depends on the sign of @xmath61 .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out [ ] that there is a critical dimension @xmath62 where @xmath61 changes sign .",
    "@xmath61 is positive for @xmath63 and negative for @xmath64 .",
    "the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ figkk ] includes an additional branch ( the purple branch ) that comes off the origin @xmath65 .",

    "it has horizon topology @xmath48 .",
    "the existence of such solutions is intuitively clear . in the small mass limit @xmath66 and to leading order , this is simply a @xmath67-dimensional schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the presence of the periodic boundary conditions in @xmath53 deform the finite @xmath68 solution away from schwarzschild .",
    "the exact analytic form of this branch is also unknown .",
    "it is possible , however , to analyze the metric of small black holes analytically by using the method of asymptotic expansions [ ] .",
    "this method sets up a perturbative expansion around the small mass limit @xmath69 .",
    "a similar approach in the next section will teach us about higher dimensional black rings in an ultra - spinning regime .",
    "[ figkk ] suggests that the above two branches meet at a topology changing transition point .",
    "the scenario of such a transition was suggested early on by kol [ ] .",

    "clearly new possibilities arise as we increase the dimension of the compact manifold .",
    "an example that will be relevant for the discussion of the next section is the case of the torus ( @xmath78 ) .",

    "in this section we will summarize what is known about the phases of neutral rotating black holes in the @xmath22-dimensional mikowski space @xmath82 .",

    "the two disconnected horizons are in thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath11 they have the same temperature and horizon angular velocity .    the neutral black rings and saturns that we consider here have several types of instabilities",

    "indeed , in our phase diagrams , we fix the total @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the black saturn , but the mass and spin of its two constituents are not fixed separately .",
    "instead , under thermal equilibrium we demand only that the temperature and angular velocity of the black ring and the central black hole are equal .",
