    "when an astronomical object ( lens ) is closely aligned with a background star ( source ) , the light from the source is deflected by the gravity of the lens , resulting in brightening of the source star .",
    "the magnification of the source flux is related to the projected lens - source separation by @xmath3 where the separation @xmath4 is expressed in units of the angular einstein radius @xmath5 .",
    "the einstein radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens system by @xmath6 where @xmath7 mas @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the mass of the lens , @xmath10 is the relative source - lens parallax , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the distances to the lens and source star , respectively .",
    "the relative motion between the source , lens , and observer leads to light variation of the source star ( lensing event ) .",
    "the first microlensing events were detected by @xcite and @xcite from the experiments conducted based on the proposal of @xcite . with the development of observational strategy combined with upgraded instrument",
    ", the detection rate of lensing events has been dramatically increased from several dozen events per year during the early phase of lensing experiments to more than a thousand events per year in current experiments .",
    "the magnification of source star flux increases as the lens approaches closer to the source star . for a small fraction of events ,",
    "the lens - source separation is even smaller than the source radius and the lens passes over the surface of the source star .",
    "these events are of scientific importance due to various reasons .",
    "first , a high - magnification event with a lens passing over a source star provides a rare chance to measure the brightness profile of a remote star .",
    "for such an event , in which the lens - source separation is comparable to the source size near the peak of the event , different parts of the source star are magnified by different amounts .",
    "the resulting lensing light curve deviates from the standard form of a point - source event @xcite and the analysis of the deviation enables to measure the limb - darkening profile of the lensed star @xcite . with the same principle ,",
    "it is also possible to study irregular surface structures such as spots @xcite .",

    "the light curve at the moment of the entrance ( exit ) of the lens into ( from ) the source surface exhibits inflection of the curvature .",
    "the duration of the passage over the source as measured by the interval between the entrance and exit of the lens over the surface of the source star is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the source radius in units of @xmath5 ( normalized source radius ) , @xmath15 is the lens - source separation normalized by @xmath5 at the moment of the closest approach ( impact parameter ) , and @xmath16 is the time scale for the lens to transit @xmath5 ( einstein time scale ) .",
    "the impact parameter and the einstein time scale are measured from the overall shape of the light curve and the duration of the event . with the known @xmath15 and @xmath16 combined with the measured duration of passage over the source",
    ", the normalized source radius is measured from the relation ( [ eq3 ] ) . with the additional information about the angular source size , @xmath17 , then the einstein radius and the lens - source proper motion",
    "are measured as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . for general lensing events ,",
    "the einstein time scale is the only measurable quantity related to the physical parameters of the lens .",
    "however , the time scale results from the combination of 3 physical parameters of the mass of the lens , @xmath9 , the distance to the lens , @xmath11 , and the lens - source transverse speed , @xmath20 , and thus the information about the lens is highly degenerate . the einstein radius , on the other hand ,",
    "does not depend on @xmath20 and thus the physical parameters of the lens can be better constrained . for a fraction of events with long time scales , it is possible to additionally measure the lens parallax , @xmath21 , from the deviation of the light curve induced by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun . with the einstein radius and the lens",
    "parallax measured , the physical parameters of the lens are uniquely determined @xcite .",
    "third , high - magnification events are sensitive to planetary companions of lenses .",
    "this is because a planet induces a small caustic near the primary lens and a high - magnification event resulting from the source trajectory passing close to the primary has a high chance to produce signals indicating the existence of the planet @xcite .",
    "for an event with a lens passing over a source star , the planetary signal is weakened by the finite - source effect @xcite .",

    "most stars in the galactic bulge are too faint for spectroscopic observations even with large telescopes .",

    "modeling the light curve of each event is conducted by searching for a set of lensing parameters that best describes the observed light curve .",

    "to the first order approximation , the finite - source effect is described by the normalized source radius , @xmath76 . for more refined description of the deviation ,",
    "additional parameters of the limb - darkening coefficients , @xmath77 , are needed to account for the variation of the deviation caused by the brightness profile of the source star surface . with the coefficients ,",

    "the direction of the parallax vector corresponds to the lens - source relative motion in the frame of the earth .",
    "the size of the parallax vector corresponds to the ratio of the earth s orbit , i.e. 1 au , to the einstein radius projected on the observer s plane .    for a high - magnification event ,",
    "the peak of the light curve can exhibit additional deviations if the lens has a companion . for a planetary companion located near the einstein ring of the primary lens or a binary companion with a separation from the primary substantially smaller or larger than the einstein radius ,",
    "a small caustic is induced near the location of the primary lens .",
    "then , the source trajectory of a high - magnification event passing close to the primary lens has a high chance to approach the caustic , resulting in a perturbation near the peak of the light curve .",
    "description of the perturbation induced by a lens companion requires 3 additional parameters of the mass ratio between the binary lens components , @xmath84 , the projected separation in units of the einstein radius , @xmath85 , and the angle between the source trajectory and the binary axis , @xmath86 .    for each event , we search for a solution of the best - fit lensing parameters by minimizing @xmath73 in the parameter space . for the @xmath73 minimization",
