    "as the ability to manipulate small particles or groups of small particles has advanced , there have been a growing number of studies examining the effect of local perturbations such as driving a single probe particle through a particle assembly in colloidal @xcite and granular @xcite media . the fluctuations and transport characteristics of the probe particle",
    "can undergo pronounced changes depending on the ordering of the surrounding media , the particle - particle interactions , the temperature , and the magnitude of the external force on the probe particle .",
    "in systems with short range interactions such as disks or granular particles @xcite , the velocity of the probe particle can drop under even a small change in the bulk media density as the jamming transition is approached . for bulk densities below jamming ,",
    "the external force needed to move the probe particle is small or absent and the probe particle velocity distribution is bimodal @xcite .",
    "close to jamming , the external force needed to push the probe particle through the medium becomes finite and rapidly increases , while the velocity fluctuations are intermittent and have a power law distribution that has been interpreted as arising due to criticality associated with the jamming transition @xcite .    for systems with longer range interactions such as charged colloids",
    ", there is an elastic or coupled flow regime at low drives where the probe particle drags the entire assembly of particles without any local tearing @xcite . at higher drives",
    "there can be a well defined transition to a plastic response regime where the probe particle induces tearing rearrangements in the surrounding media , and the velocity of the probe particle differs from that of the particles it is dragging . the velocity - force curves in these systems can be used to identify the critical driving force separating the elastic and plastic regimes .",
    "the velocity increases as a power law with increasing external force in the plastic regime , similar to the behavior observed for plastic depinning of vortices @xcite and colloids @xcite in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "it is also possible to consider the motion of a forced particle through a surrounding medium in the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "such a situation has been studied for dragging individual vortices in type - ii superconductors @xcite , where a driven vortex interacts with the intrinsic pinning in the sample as well as with the surrounding vortices . in this case",
    ", the probe particle can be indirectly pinned due to its interaction with bulk particles that are strongly directly pinned by the substrate , causing the appearance of a threshold depinning force for the probe particle @xcite . at higher drives ,",
    "the bulk pinning can counterintuitively lower the effective drag on the probe particle .",
    "this occurs since the drag originates when having a portion of the surrounding particles move with the probe particle , so that when the quenched disorder strongly immobilizes the surrounding particles , they can no longer move with the probe particle , leading to an effective decoupling of the probe particle from the surrounding media @xcite . for probe particles driven through crystalline structures in the absence of quenched disorder , shear thinning",
    "@xcite and directional locking effects occur where the amount of drag on the probe particle depends on the orientation of the drive with respect to the symmetry directions of the crystalline structure .",
    "flow along a symmetry direction produces a lower drag since the probe particle can move easily between particles in the background lattice without constantly generating new topological defects , while for other driving directions , the probe particle induces the formation of local topological defects , leading to increased drag @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that for driving along symmetry directions , the drag increases as the bulk melting temperature is approached due to the formation of topological defects in the region surrounding the probe particle , leading to a local melting transition @xcite .    here",
    ", instead of a single driven probe particle , we consider the case of a localized quasi - one - dimensional region of particles driven externally along a line .",
    "the drive is parallel to the orientation of the line .",
    "such a geometry could be created using a laser beam directed along the sample edge , with magnetic particles driven by a magnetic strip , or with particles coupled to a mechanical external drive or driven with one - dimensional arrays of optical traps @xcite .",
    "driven line geometries have already been realized for particles with yukawa interactions in dusty plasmas , where a laser beam pushes particles only along a line @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to create systems with bulk pinning and an easy flow channel in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "a key difference between the point probe particle and the line probe considered here is that the line probe more directly mimics a shear response .",
    "if the system is strongly coupled , then an elastic response will occur in which the particles in the system move along with the particles in the driven line . here",
    "we study the case of a line of particles driven along a symmetry direction of the background lattice for monodisperse ordered , bidisperse ordered , and bidisperse disordered systems , both for pin - free samples and for samples that have pinning present in the bulk .",

    "this occurs when the particles in the driven channel partially decouple from the bulk particles and are able to move past them .",
