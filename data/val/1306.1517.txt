    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite or generally the gauge / gravity duality , has provided us very effective tools to study the properties of the strongly coupled quantum field theories which live on the boundary of certain gravitational backgrounds .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of the gauge / gravity duality is that it is a kind of strong - weak duality . in view of this duality , various important phenomena of the strongly coupled field theories can be studied by performing calculations on their dual weakly coupled gravity side .",
    "recently , motivated from the study in condensed matter physics , many attempts have been made in constructing bulk gravitational solutions to model numerous types of strongly coupled phenomena in condensed matter systems , especially close to the phase transition or quantum critical points , including the superconductor ( superfluid ) phase transition @xcite , fermi and non - fermi liquids @xcite , superconductor - insulator transitions @xcite etc , for recent review , see @xcite .",
    "there are also some quantum phase transition systems in condensed matter physics which contain the lifshitz - fixed points have received much attention . on one hand , these developments successfully extended the gauge / gravity duality into the more general form , namely , non - relativistic version @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "they allow us to study strongly coupled systems toward realistic laboratory conditions by holographic principle , which may also be used as a test for the gauge / gravity duality itself .",
    "this paper focuses on dealing with lifshitz field theory in the framework of the non - relativistic gauge / gravity duality .",
    "following our previous work @xcite , we continue studying the holographic optical conductivity in the quantum field theory which is dual to the lifshitz black brane with two independent @xmath1 gauge fields @xcite . to compare with the phenomena in condensed matter physics , we work in a @xmath2-dimensional lifshitz spacetime , _",
    "i.e. _ , the dual field theory is @xmath3-dimensional , and we focus on the case of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "when @xmath6 , the lifshtiz black brane will return to the usual reissner - nordstrm ( rn)-ads black brane , therefore , the optical conductivity we obtain is similar to those studied in previous ads / condensed matter literatures , such as @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath0 the optical conductivity , especially its ac part , shows interesting behavior which is less discussed before as far as we know .",
    "more explicitly , we find that the optical conductivity will possess a non - trivial scaling with respect to the frequency in large frequency regime when @xmath0 , such as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a function of @xmath5 .",
    "this feature is very interesting , since in the previous literatures people argued that the large frequency behavior of the electric conductivity in @xmath3-dimensional field theory will approach to a constant due to the dimensionless of the conductivity @xcite . while in this paper we do find a counterexample .",
    "we argue from the viewpoint of non - relativistic gauge / gravity duality that the particular scaling behavior of the optical conductivity with respect to large frequency is caused by the couplings between the dilaton and the electromagnetic fields in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) theory .",
    "this kind of non - minimal coupling will probably introduce extra dimensional scale into the boundary field system , which results in the peculiar evolution of the optical conductivity associated with the frequency . for earlier studies on holographic properties of charged dilatonic black brane in emd theory with non - minimal coupling in asymptotically ads spacetime ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , we surprisingly find from the condensed matter literatures that there indeed exists a similar universal behavior of the optical conductivity in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional condensed matter systems , such as @xcite , in which the authors studied the optical conductivity in various disordered solids both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "we observe that the optical conductivity studied in the present holographic model has very like behaviors to those in disordered solids in the extreme disorder limit for both high and low frequencies , at least qualitatively . in order to figure out this interesting phenomenon in more detail , we extend our previous study on the optical conductivity @xcite into various temperatures and find that in the low frequency regime , the optical conductivity will decrease as the temperature decreases , which is consistent with the experiments in @xcite qualitatively .",
    "in particular , at zero temperature the conductivity will vanish , which suggests that the conducting electrons will be frozen at zero temperature .",
    "in addition , we show that all the optical conductivities will have the same scaling with respect to the frequency",
    "whatever the temperature is for the fixed @xmath5 in the high frequency regime .",
    "this robust phenomenon for the high frequency behavior of the conductivity is also in accordance with the experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also find a linear relation between the logarithmic of the optical conductivity versus the reciprocal of the temperature in some regime of the temperatures , which is qualitatively similar to those in disordered solids @xcite , as well .",
    "all of these consistencies of the holographic optical conductivity with those in various disordered solids allow us to guess that there might be some deep relationship between them , although the underlying precise details are not very clear at present .",
    "strictly speaking , there are no apparent disorder parameters in our model , namely , there is neither spatial inhomogeneity in the background spacetime , nor interaction terms randomly distributed on the spatial coordinates like those studied in @xcite . however , we want to point out that the fluctuation of the second @xmath1 gauge field in our construction could be interpreted as the impurity field @xcite , which interacts with the first @xmath1 gauge field indirectly through the dilaton field .",
    "the homogeneous optical conductivity may relate the extreme disorder limit of disordered solids in which local randomly varying mobilities of charge carriers cover many orders of typical length scale of the condensed matter system @xcite .",
    "the rest parts of this paper is organized as follows : the configuration of the asymptotic lifshitz brane is briefly introduced in section [ sect : intro ] ; we show the numerical results of the optical conductivity in section [ sect : conduc ] ; the conclusions and discussions are drawn in section [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "the bulk gravitational theory we consider is the @xmath2-dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) theory with the action @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cosmological constant , @xmath11 @xmath12 are the @xmath1 gauge field strengths associated with two independent gauge fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the dilaton field , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the coupling constants between the gauge fields and the dilaton .",
    "the dynamical equations in the bulk are @xmath18 one of the solutions for the above emd theory is a kind of charged lifshitz black brane derived in @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the curvature radius of the lifshitz spacetime , @xmath21 is the scalar field amplitude , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively related to the mass and charge of the black brane .",
    "the hawking temperature of the lifshitz black brane and the entropy density of boundary non - relativistic field are respectively t=()^z+1(-)s= , where we have denoted the location of the outer event horizon to be @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "in this section , we will numerically compute the optical conductivity of the non - relativistic quantum field theory dual to the above charged lifshitz black brane .",
    "gauge field @xmath26 in the linear perturbation limit , i.e. , the bulk effective action is expanded up to the second order which corresponds to the tree level approximation from the boundary quantum field theory side .",
    "note that the optical conductivity of the disordered solids is related to the hopping of electrons or ions , thus it is more appropriate to consider the charge transport of the fermions , namely , to compute the optical conductivity from the bulk charged fermions .",
    "however , such optical conductivity is from the one - loop bulk effective action contribution , see @xcite for related studies in ads spacetime .",
    "we expect that the optical conductivities obtained by these two methods reveal different aspects of the boundary condensed matter system and we will further study their relationship in another work . ] we will show that the holographic optical conductivity is qualitatively similar to those in various of disordered solids in condensed matter systems . in order to calculate the electric conductivity @xmath27 , we will turn on the @xmath28direction perturbation of the gauge field @xmath26 , and also the perturbation along @xmath29-component of the metric , _",
    "i.e. _ , we will work out the electric conductivity with backreaction .",
    "is divergent at the boundary @xmath30 , it plays a key role in supporting the geometry of the lifshitz spacetime instead of contributing to the free charge of the electromagnetic field ; while @xmath31 is the real free electromagnetic field . besides",
    ", our numeric results also show that the perturbation of @xmath32 , say @xmath33 , is divergent at the boundary .",
    "thus only the fluctuations of @xmath34 , namely , @xmath35 is the genuine electromagnetic perturbations , which will contribute to the electric conductivities .",
    "therefore , we only need to turn on the perturbations @xmath35 and @xmath36 , while turning off the perturbation @xmath33 . in the following",
    "we will refer to the perturbations @xmath35 as @xmath37 .",
    "] specifically , we will set the perturbation of gauge fields as @xmath38 , as well as the perturbations of the metric along @xmath29-direction to be @xmath39 .",
    "is the transverse channel and @xmath36 is the shear channel , they are both vector modes and their eoms can be obtained by applying the combined variation ( diffeomorphism + @xmath1 gauge transformation ) to the bulk maxwell equation , which only results in two independent eoms for @xmath35 and @xmath36 as eq.([eomhtx ] ) and eq.([eoma2x ] ) . while other linear perturbations are decoupled with the vector mode and will not affect the calculation on the optical conductivity . ]",
    "it turns out that the coupled linear eoms for the perturbations are , [ eomhtx ] h_tx-2r h_tx+&=&0 , + [ eoma2x ] a_x+(++_2)a_x+(-)a_x&=&0 . for @xmath30 , eq .",

    "explicitly , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants for @xmath6 ; @xmath46 is a constant while @xmath49 for @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant ; @xmath46 is a constant while @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",

    "however , in condensed matter physics , the electric conductivity will not always tend to a constant even in @xmath3-dimensional field theory .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the author studied the optical conductivity for various disordered solids in @xmath3 dimensions both from the experiments and model building , and showed that there does exist a nontrivial scaling behavior of the electric conductivity in the large frequency regime , which is independent of details of the disordered solids .    in order to compare our holographic results to the results in condensed matter physics",

    "it can be found that the behavior of the conductivity is very similar to those in @xcite , at least qualitatively .",
    "we need to point out that although the coincidence of the holographic conductivity with those in disordered solids are very surprising , the underlying detailed correspondence between these two aspects are still unclear so far . unlike previous attempts on studying the impurities and disordered systems via gauge / gravity duality in which interactions randomly distributed spatially are added in the action @xcite , there are no such interaction terms introduced in our model instead of two spatial uniformly distributed @xmath1 gauge fields coupled with the dilaton in eq.([emd1 ] ) . however , we find that the peculiar frequency dependence of the holographic optical conductivities in eq.([largeom ] ) stem from the coupling of the dilaton with the second maxwell field in eq . , _",

    "in order to see more clearly how we obtain this particular feature in the optical conductivity , we compare our calculations with those performed in the lifshitz black brane which is a solution of the emd theory with only one @xmath1 gauge field ( it has a similar role as @xmath32 in our case ) @xcite . rather than two gauge fields case , the single @xmath1 gauge field can only supports the geometry of a neutral lifshtiz spacetime . to study the conductivities",
    ", additional probe gauge field needs to be added into the background , it is shown that this kind of probe gauge field actually had the same @xmath67 dependence as @xmath26 in our paper . however , the key difference was that the probe @xmath1 gauge field added in @xcite is minimally coupled , namely , it does not couple with the background dilaton .",
    "however , we have a natural interaction between the dilaton and the gauge field @xmath26 in the action and consequently , the effect of the dilaton @xmath15 will enter into the coefficient of @xmath68 , _",

    "] besides , the rest terms in eq . are the same as those in @xcite when approaching the boundary @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , this dilaton contribution to the coefficients of @xmath68 is very crucial . it will modify the expansions of @xmath37 near the boundary , and finally make the conductivity varies as well . turning on the backreaction in the @xmath29 component",
    "will only affect the conductivity in the low frequency regime . because the metric fluctuations will only enter into the coefficients of @xmath37 , and it has a higher order of @xmath72 than the term contains @xmath74 .",
    "in our paper , it is @xmath75 which will decay more rapidly than the term @xmath76 which contains @xmath74 when @xmath30 , please see eq .. therefore , the backreaction will have a minor modification on the large frequency behavior of the conductivity .",
    "this can also be understood physically , because for large frequency the frequency energy will be dominant than other ingredients , such as the temperature , chemical potential , etc .",
    "this is also the origin of the universality that the high frequency behavior of the conductivity is robust against the temperature . ]",
    "physically , we speculate that the interactions between the dilaton and the maxwell fields will give extra dimensional scale into the boundary field system and consequently render the conductivity not to tend to a constant at high frequency .",
    "although there are a lot of works studying the conductivity in dilaton gravity from the gauge / gravity duality before , such as @xcite , they mainly focus on the relativistic case , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 .",

    "therefore , they studied the conductivity for a @xmath81-dimensional field theory , if compared to our backgrounds . ]",
    "we also find that the high frequency behavior of the conductivities have the same slope whatever the temperature is .",
    "this kind of universality of the optical conductivity was also similar to those analyzed in @xcite .",
    "this property can be understood from what we have mentioned in the footnote [ f2 ] that for large frequency , the frequency energy will dominant , therefore , the temperature effect will be minor .    @xmath62",

    "<S> surprisingly , we find that the optical ac conductivity satisfies the nontrivial ( non-)power law scaling in the high frequency regime rather than approaching to a constant when the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 , which is qualitatively similar to those in various disordered solids in condensed matter systems . besides , this ( non-)power law scaling behavior shows some universality , which is robust against the temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the peculiar scaling behavior of ac conductivity may stem from the couplings of the dilaton field with the gauge fields and also the logarithmic behavior near the boundary in the lifshitz spacetime . </S>"
