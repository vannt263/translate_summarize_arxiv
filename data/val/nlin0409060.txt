    "after the prediction of self - trapping @xcite of an optical beam in a nonlinear medium resulting in an optical soliton @xcite , there have been many theoretical and experimental studies to stabilize such a soliton under different conditions of nonlinearity and dispersion .",
    "a bright soliton in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension ( d ) in kerr medium ( cubic nonlinearity ) is unconditionally stable for positive or self - focusing ( sf ) nonlinearity in the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xcite .",
    "however , in ( 2 + 1)d and ( 3 + 1)d , in homogeneous bulk kerr medium one can not have an unconditionally stable soliton - like beam @xcite .",
    "( if the nonlinearity is negative or self - defocusing ( sdf ) , any initially created soliton always spreads out @xcite . )",
    "if the nonlinearity is positive or of sf type , any initially created highly localized soliton is unstable in both ( 2 + 1)d and ( 3 + 1)d @xcite .",
    "such a confined wave packet in ( 3 + 1)d is often called a light bullet and represents the extension of a self - trapped optical beam into the temporal domain @xcite .",
    "the generation of a light bullet is of vital importance in soliton - based communication systems . on the experimental front strong stabilization of ( 2 + 1)d discrete vortex solitons in a sf nonlinear medium",
    "have been observed in optically induced photonic lattices @xcite .",
    "such solitons , however , can only be modeled by a more complicated nonlinearity in the nls in contrast to the simple cubic kerr nonlinearity considered in this paper .",
    "recently , through a numerical simulation as well as a variational calculation based on the nls it has been shown that a soliton in ( 2 + 1)d @xcite can be stabilized in a layered medium if a variable kerr nonlinearity coefficient is used in different layers @xcite .",
    "a weak modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient along the propagation direction leads to a reasonable stabilization in ( 2 + 1)d @xcite . a much better stabilization results if the kerr coefficient is a layered medium is allowed to vary rapidly between successive sdf and sf type nonlinearities , i.e. , between positive and negative values @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years optical soliton formed by a controlled variation of dispersion coefficient ( dispersion - managed optical soliton ) in a kerr medium has been of general interest in communication @xcite .",
    "a dispersion - managed soliton allows robust propagation of pulses and is favored over normal solitons .",
    "the recent stabilized optical beam in a nonlinear waveguide array in ( 1 + 1)d @xcite , called diffraction managed soliton , is quite similar to the present dispersion - managed optical soliton .",
    "that problem was described @xcite by the one dimensional nls with a periodic dispersion coefficient .",
    "such a periodic variation of the dispersion coefficient leads to a greater stability of the soliton during propagation in ( 1 + 1)d @xcite .",
    "more recently , abdullaev _ et al _ @xcite have shown by a variational and numerical solution of the nls that by employing a rapidly varying dispersion coefficient it is possible to stabilize an optical soliton in ( 2 + 1)d over large propagation distances .    the possibility of the stabilization of an optical soliton in ( 2 + 1)d by dispersion management @xcite and kerr singularity management @xcite as well as in ( 3 + 1)d by kerr singularity management @xcite in sf medium has led us to investigate the possibility of the stabilization of an optical soliton in ( 3 + 1)d by dispersion management .",
    "however , some of these studies were concerned with the stabilization of bose - einstein condensates @xcite using the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite which is very similar to the nls structurally .",
    "the extension of the problem of stabilization of optical soliton from lower to higher dimensions , e.g. from ( 1 + 1)d to ( 3 + 1)d , is of great interest in the actual three - dimensional world .",
    "it is also more challenging due to the possibility of violent collapse in sf medium in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "we begin the present study with a time - dependent variational solution of the nls with a rapidly oscillating dispersion coefficient in ( 3 + 1)d .",
    "the variational method leads to a set of coupled differential equations for the soliton width and chirp parameters , which is solved numerically by the fourth - order adams - bashforth method @xcite .",
    "the variational solution illustrates that a ( 3 + 1)d light bullet can be stabilized over a large propagation distance in a kerr sf medium with a rapidly oscillating dispersion coefficient for beam power above a critical value .",
    "next we turn to a complete numerical solution of the partial differential nls by the crank - nicholson method @xcite .",
    "the complete numerical solution demonstrates the stabilization of a light bullet over large propagation distance by dispersion management in ( 3 + 1)d sf kerr medium .",
    "we also compare the present stabilization of a light bullet by dispersion management with the stabilization obtained by applying an oscillating kerr nonlinearity as suggested in ref .",
    "we find that both schemes leads to comparable stabilization of a light bullet over a large propagation distance of few thousand units .",
    "although , the present work is of primary interest in the generation of robust optical solitons , it is also of interest from a mathematical point of view in nonlinear physics in the stabilization of a soliton in three dimensions .",
    "moreover , this investigation has interesting implication in the study of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the quantum nonlinear equation governing the evolution of the condensate , known as the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , is identical with the ( classical ) nls @xcite , for the evolution of optical soliton , although the interpretation of the different variables of these two equations is different . in recent years",
    "there has been experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of bose - einstein condensates in periodic optical - lattice potentials generated by a standing - wave laser beam . by an effective - mass description , the gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate in a periodic optical - lattice potential",
    "can be reduced to a dispersion - managed nls , where the effective mass could be positive or negative @xcite .",
    "there has already been experimental application of such dispersion management to bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the effective mass can be varied by changing the parameters of the periodic potential @xcite .",
    "once a controlled variation of the effective mass would be possible , it might be possible to stabilize a bose - einstein condensate in this fashion .    in sec .",
    "ii we present a variational study of the problem and demonstrate the possible stabilization of a light bullet in ( 3 + 1)d . in sec .",
    "iii we present a complete numerical study based on the nls to study in detail the stabilization of a dispersion - managed light bullet .",
