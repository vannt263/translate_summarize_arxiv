    "the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have both reported an excess in the diphoton channel at an invariant mass of about @xmath0  gev corresponding to a local ( global ) significance of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , respectively .",
    "the result is of course not conclusive , but if the excess were confirmed , this would be the first sign of new physics at the terascale energies .",
    "the simplest explanation requires the production of an @xmath8-channel spin-0 or spin-2 resonance according to the yang ",
    "landau theorem  @xcite .",
    "the observed cross section of roughly @xmath9  fb is relatively large and thus it is natural to assume that the new resonance is produced via the strong interaction and have a large decay rate into diphotons",
    ". a light quark initiated resonance would be in severe tension with the lhc run - i , since the parton luminosity ratio between @xmath10  tev and @xmath3  tev is relatively small for light quark initial states . as a consequence ,",
    "the resonance would have been observed at lhc run - i if it were produced via quark  antiquark initial states . for a gluon induced resonance",
    "the tension with @xmath3  tev is reduced but still significant  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "associated production with @xmath2 quarks does not suffer from @xmath3  tev constraints . moreover ,",
    "the reported event topology is consistent with the single production of a resonance , i.e.   non - resonant production of the @xmath0  gev particle in a cascade decay @xcite is disfavored since no additional activity was observed in the peak - region events .",
    "finally , the apparently large width of around 45  gev , preferred by atlas , points to large couplings to its daughter particles . however , strict constraints exist on decays of heavy resonances into electroweak gauge bosons and light standard model ( sm ) fermions and thus the resonance should decay into final states which evade all current experimental searches , implying e.g.  a large invisible decay rate or decays to quarks and gluons",
    ". another way out ( which we actually consider in this paper ) would be the presence of two overlapping resonances with narrow widths which allow to explain the large width within the current experimental accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the observed diphoton rate can not be explained with a sm - like higgs boson because its tree - level decays into third generation quarks and/or gauge bosons are too large compared to the loop induced decays into diphoton final states .",
    "however , simple extensions of the sm higgs sector such as a singlet extension or two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) are also plagued with too small diphoton rates and the way out is to introduce new vector - like fermions : see e.g.  @xcite ; see @xcite for an overview .",
    "there are only a few phenomenologically viable explanations within the framework of supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite .",
    "it seems to be impossible to find a solution within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "new vector - like fermions and singlets have to be added to the particle spectrum of the mssm in order to explain the diphoton excess  @xcite .",
    "other susy solutions either involves @xmath11-parity violation  @xcite or assume a very low susy breaking scale  @xcite .    the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) ",
    "see  @xcite for a review  is a well - motivated supersymmetry - inspired extension of the sm . beyond the elegant features of supersymmetric models in view of the hierarchy problem or one - step unification , and their potential in terms of dark matter ( dm )",
    ", the original purpose of the nmssm rests with the ` @xmath12-problem '  @xcite of the simpler mssm : this issue is addressed via the addition of a singlet superfield to the matter content of the mssm , the ` @xmath12'-parameter then being generated dynamically when the singlet takes a vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v . ) .",
    "additionally , the nmssm has received renewed attention ever since the higgs discovery in the run - i phase of the lhc  @xcite , due to its interesting features in terms of a supersymmetric interpretation of the observed higgs signals ",
    "see  @xcite for a recent analysis and list of references .",
    "while several versions of the nmssm can be formulated , we will focus here on the simplest one , characterized by a @xmath13-symmetry and cp - conservation .",
    "let us stress here that we will not include new exotic matter but rely strictly on the simple matter content of this model .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to present a phenomenologically viable scenario accounting for the diphoton excess at @xmath1  gev in the context of the nmssm .",
    "this explanation rests on the possibility that a @xmath14 process ",
    "see figure  [ fig : process ]  could not be distinguished from a diphoton signal in the experimental searches  @xcite .",
    "the nmssm higgs sector then offers a suitable framework to embed this topology : @xmath15 can be identified with a very light cp - odd singlet decaying dominantly into a diphoton pair , while heavy cp - even doublet and the cp - even singlet have to be combined to mimic a @xmath0  gev resonance with adequate properties . note that contrarily to the proposals which we mentioned earlier , the mechanism that we consider does not rely on the ad hoc inclusion of additional matter ( e.g.  vector - like fermions ) and uses only the existing features and degrees of freedom of a rather simple and well - motivated model . while our project was in its finalizing stages , we became aware of another recent proposal to explain the diphoton signals within the nmssm  @xcite , which shares some traits with our interpretation but also differs in several respects .",
    "the diphoton decay of the pseudoscalar in  @xcite relies on a substantial ` quasi - mixing ' of this higgs state with the @xmath16-meson : this requirement induces substantial limits from @xmath17-decays and results in a quite constrained regime . in our case",
    ", we consider the mixing with the @xmath18 and estimate this effect more quantitatively using the chiral perturbation theory for pions .",
    "moreover , we shall propose a wider selection of benchmark points , illustrating the flexibility of the mechanisms that we employ .",
    "furthermore , we shall analyze in further detail how our scenario compares to the experimental data and study complementary signatures .    in the following section",
    ", we will detail how the nmssm provides an acceptable framework for the @xmath1  gev signal and address several phenomenological issues which constrain the parameter space .",
    "we will thus propose specific examples of nmssm points satisfying these requirements before discussing their relevance in fitting the diphoton excess in section  [ sec : collider ] .",
    "then we consider other experimental signatures that are specific to our model and have promising prospects in the run - ii , including the decays of the light pseudoscalar to @xmath19 pairs .",
    "we also discuss possible experimental signatures from the higgsino , slepton , and heavy higgs bosons sector .",
    "we will conclude with a brief summary in the last section .",
    "the nmssm higgs sector  see e.g.  @xcite  consists of two doublets , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , coupling in a type ii fashion at tree level , as well as a singlet @xmath22 .",
    "once the goldstone bosons are rotated away , one is left with a pair of charged states @xmath23 , two doublet and one singlet cp - even degrees of freedom , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , and finally one doublet and one singlet cp - odd components , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the simplest , @xmath13- and cp - conserving version of the nmssm , which we are considering in this paper , counts seven parameters in the higgs sector , which can be denoted as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31  three soft squared masses , @xmath32 , @xmath33  two yukawa - like supersymmetric couplings , @xmath34 and @xmath35  the two corresponding trilinear soft couplings .",
    "it is customary to use the minimization conditions of the higgs potential to trade three of these parameters , e.g.  the soft squared masses , for the higgs v.e.v.s , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( so that @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 .",
    "the electroweak properties then imply the identification @xmath40  gev , @xmath41 representing the fermi constant .",
    "moreover , in order to provide a more physical handle on the parameter space , we define @xmath42  which is analogous to its mssm ` @xmath12 ' counterpart and also sets the tree - level mass of the higgsino states  and @xmath43  which sets the scale of an approximate higgs @xmath44-doublet , generally heavy , i.e.  @xmath45  gev , if one wants to avoid the complications of light non - sm - like doublet states . at tree level .",
    "we will prefer @xmath46 in the following since it leads to slightly simpler expressions . ] in the following , we shall employ the parameter set @xmath47 .      in",
    "order to fit the diphoton excess , we want to employ the @xmath14 topology .",
    "obviously , @xmath48 would be a cp - even ( in order to allow a decay to two lighter identical states ) higgs state at @xmath1  gev , while @xmath15 could be in principle cp - odd or cp - even : given the limited pool of higgs states in the nmssm and the fact that we will have another use for the cp - even singlet ( see below ) , this state will be identified , however , with the singlet - like pseudoscalar . for its diphoton decay to be indistinguishable from a single photon , this higgs state would have to be light enough : @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "we observe that this scenario with a light cp - odd state is phenomenologically viable , in view of the current status of collider constraints .",
    "however , severe limits intervene at low mass from , e.g.  flavor observables or the properties of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath50  a sizable branching fraction @xmath51 would be at odds with the measurements of atlas and cms in the lhc run - i phase .",
    "note that the @xmath15 state can not be dominantly doublet in view of the consequences for the spectrum : this would indeed imply the presence of a light charged higgs ( likely in contradiction with limits from top decays @xcite ) and a light cp - even doublet state ( in tension with lep @xcite and likely to open up sizable unconventional decays of @xmath50 ) .",
    "we complete this discussion with a remark concerning the naturalness of a light cp - odd higgs in the nmssm : in two specific limits , this particle appears as the pseudo - goldstone boson of an approximate symmetry of the higgs sector :    * for @xmath52 , i.e.  @xmath53 , the higgs potential is invariant under a @xmath54 peccei  quinn symmetry , under which the charges @xmath55 of the doublets and singlet satisfy @xmath56 ; * for @xmath57 , one obtains another @xmath54 symmetry , with the higgs charges @xmath58 satisfying @xmath59 : this is the @xmath11-symmetry limit since the higgs charges for the specific choice @xmath60 coincide with those that these fields would receive under a genuine @xmath11-symmetry ( also broken by the gaugino masses ) of the nmssm with unbroken supersymmetry . note that with our choice of parameters , @xmath61 ( by definition of @xmath46 ) .",
    "we will see that , in the scenario under consideration , the factor @xmath62 has to be small , so that the @xmath11-symmetry limit can be invoked    most of the characteristics of the nmssm which intervene in the interpretation of the signal at @xmath1  gev and the subsequent constraints can be understood from the relations at tree level .",
    "this follows from the fact that the relevant physics is driven by comparatively heavy or singlet - like states , for which the radiative corrections are relatively mild in proportion .",
    "we shall therefore propose a discussion at tree level in the following .",
    "note , however that loop corrections play a crucial role for the mass of the sm - like higgs state so that we will employ tools including leading radiative effects in the numerical analysis ( see below ) . of course",
    ", the exact correlations at tree level are slightly displaced by loop corrections so that small adjustments in the choice of parameters will prove necessary and the relations that we derive below should not be understood as rigid constraints , but rather as qualitative guidelines / trends .    in the base @xmath63 , the tree - level squared - mass matrix for the nmssm cp - odd sector reads @xmath64\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we observe that the singlet squared - mass @xmath65 is largely determined by the choice of @xmath35 ( since the other terms are small ) .",
    "in particular , low values of @xmath35 ensure that the singlet is light .",
    "note also that in this case @xmath66  as we will see later , @xmath67  gev .",
    "the subdominant doublet component of the light cp - odd mass state @xmath68 can be obtained as approximately : @xmath69 from now on , we identify this light state @xmath70 to the state @xmath15 of the @xmath14 topology .",
    "now we will address the decays of @xmath70 .",
    "for the mass range under consideration , @xmath71  gev , the interplay of the pseudoscalar with the strongly interacting sector is non - trivial . in a naive partonic approach ,",
    "the diphoton decay is significantly suppressed ",
    "@xmath72  for a usual nmssm pseudoscalar , as long as the competition of the hadronic and muonic final states remains open . then , below three times the pion mass ( the decay to two pions would violate parity ) , hadronic final states seem inaccessible so that the pseudoscalar would then mainly decay to muons or , below the @xmath73 threshold , to @xmath74  @xmath75 at @xmath76  mev , and the @xmath19 final state would eventually dominate at lower masses ( @xmath77  mev ) . moreover ,",
    "in such a regime , the pseudoscalar would appear as relatively long lived below the dimuon threshold : the diphoton and @xmath19 final states are essentially mediated by the small doublet component of @xmath70 , resulting in the following ( approximate ) widths ( for @xmath78  mev ) : @xmath79\\simeq(1.6\\cdot10^{-13})\\,m_{a_1}\\,(p_d\\tan\\beta)^2\\;,\\\\   & \\gamma[a _",

    "the decay length of @xmath70 at rest is then of order @xmath84 .",
    "including the boost factor in the considered topology would lead to a decay length of about @xmath85  m at the lhc , i.e.  to an invisible pseudoscalar .",
    "this picture is over - simplistic , however .",
    "as @xcite already noticed , hadronic effects could substantially affect the decays of @xmath70 .",
    "if one were to disregard the tripion threshold for strong - interacting decays , the @xmath86 and @xmath87 final states would completely dominate the partonic decays of @xmath70 , which highlights the sensitivity of the pseudoscalar to the strong sector .",
    "in particular , considering the couplings of the pseudoscalar to mesons , one can write the following operators : @xmath88 such terms induce a mixing of the higgs pseudoscalars with the pseudoscalar mesons or , in other words , open the possibility for @xmath89 or @xmath90 decays ( the latter being the choice of @xcite ) .",

    "these production cross sections and branching ratios allow us to derive the relevant cross section for the @xmath368 process ( we assume @xmath151\\simeq0.99 $ ] ) : this quantity is documented for our points in the last two lines of table  [ brprod ] , at @xmath3 and @xmath165  tev .",

    "these figures shall be analyzed with further detail in the following section .",
    "we consider resonant @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) production , @xmath371 where @xmath372 stands for the rest of the event .",
    "due to the large boost of @xmath70 , the two photons of the @xmath70 decay will be very collimated and thus the opening angle between both photons in the electronic calorimeter will be well below the angular resolution of electromagnetic calorimeters @xcite . therefore , our final state resembles a resonant diphoton final state .",
    "the atlas conference note  @xcite studied the signature of a 125  gev higgs boson decaying to four photons at @xmath373 tev with the full data set .",
    "the search estimates the efficiency of photon - pair identification as a single photon at about @xmath374@xmath267 for photons with @xmath375 and mass @xmath376@xmath377 .",
    "the efficiency heavily depends on the mass of the heavy resonance , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : deta ] which shows the @xmath378 decay where @xmath16 denotes the pseudorapidity .",
    "the dark ( blue ) curve shows the result for a higgs boson mass of @xmath379 , while the light ( beige ) curve for @xmath380 .",
    "as expected the opening angle of the photons from the 750 gev resonance is much smaller compared to the 125 gev case .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the exact efficiency without performing a full detector simulation .",
    "hence , we will choose @xmath381 in the remainder of the paper .",
    "in any case , our conclusions will not considerably change if we assume a higher efficiency as the one from the atlas study  @xcite .",
    "this means that about @xmath382 of all four - photon events within the fiducial region will be classified as diphoton events .",
    "this choice is further supported by the analysis in ref .",

    "we have implemented the 8 and 13 tev diphoton searches from atlas and cms @xcite into the checkmate 1.2.2 framework  @xcite with its analysismanager @xcite .",
    "checkmate 1.2.2 is based on the fast detector simulation delphes 3.10 @xcite with heavily modified detector tunes and it determines the number of expected signal events passing the selection cuts of the particular analysis .",
    "the selection cuts for both atlas and cms analyses are shown in table  [ tab : selection13tev ] .",
    "the resulting signal efficiency varies between 20@xmath385 and 60@xmath385 depending on the signal region , the experiment and the center - of - mass energy .    using the above setup we calculate the expected number of events in the signal regions centered at 750  gev for each parameter point * p1**p9 * in four 8 tev searches and in two 13 tev searches .",
    "the results are collected in table  [ events ] . for reference , in column two and three we provide the observed number of events above the sm background ( `` sig . '' ) and the observed @xmath386 exclusion limits calculated using ` checkmate `  @xcite .",
    "our benchmark points offer a range of cross sections for the desired signal , from @xmath387 to @xmath388  fb at 13  tev , as listed in table  [ brprod ] .",
    "points * p1 * , * p3 * , * p4 * and * p8 * fit exactly the claimed event rate from atlas  @xcite , but predict too many events in the cms signal region @xcite ; see also the discussion in  @xcite .",
    "the remaining points fulfill all constraints . in a model",

    "a similar analysis for the 8  tev data yields @xmath391 , while a combination of all the available data gives a range of cross sections @xmath392@xmath393 at 13 tev .",
    "the exact result depends on the details of the production mechanism , but our benchmark points cover well the desired range .",
    "the best fit to all data is provided by point * p5*.    in fig .",
    "[ fig : double_resonance ] , we show the diphoton invariant mass distribution of our diphoton signal for two different bin sizes .",
    "we consider benchmark point * p6 * for illustration .",
    "the distribution with the large bin size of 40 gev corresponds to the experimental bin size of the atlas study @xcite , as shown in the left panel .",
    "the experimental photon energy resolution of about 510@xmath385 would allow for a higher precision @xcite but due to the small statistical sample , both experiments have to choose a rather large bin size .",
    "one can clearly see that our benchmark point with two scalars can not be distinguished from a wide resonance with the current data . for comparison",
    "we have included into this plot the original data from atlas after subtracting the expected background .",
    "one can see that the events predicted for our * p6 * benchmark provide a good reproduction of the experimental shape .",
    "we also display in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : double_resonance ] the invariant mass distribution with a @xmath358  gev binning .",
    "while currently the experimental resolution in @xmath394 exceeds 10  gev , one can speculate that further improvements during the current lhc run will be made . with",
    "the accuracy of @xmath395  gev and an increased luminosity , the broad excess , provided it is real , might be resolved as two narrow resonances @xcite .",
    "our estimate of the number of signal events in table  [ events ] has a theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the choice of the parton distribution function , missing higher - order calculations and the details of the parton shower as well as the fragmentation induce an uncertainty on the signal rate .",
    "however , our final - state configuration is relatively simple and thus the details of the mc tuning will not significantly alter our results .",
    "the size of the uncertainty from the pdfs can be sizable .",
    "the variation between the different pdfs changes the hadronic cross section .",
    "in addition , the scale dependence of the production cross section on the renormalization and factorization scale affects the signal rate .",
    "we estimate the sum of these effects to be of the order of 10@xmath385  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the normalization can heavily depend on the value of the bottom yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "finally , we did not model the detector response of identifying a photon from the pseudoscalar decay into the diphoton state but rather choose a flat efficiency factor of @xmath396 . here",
    ", one can assume a conservative uncertainty of about @xmath397 on the signal rate due to the uncertainty in the photon identification .",
    "we conclude that the total uncertainty is of the order of @xmath398 , plus an additional uncertainty from the definition of the bottom quark mass .",
    "so far we have assumed that our signal in eq .",
    "( [ eq : signal ] ) mimics the diphoton signal since the two collimated photons of the light - pseudoscalar decay are indistinguishable from an isolated photon .",
    "however , if the four - photon final state was discriminated from the diphoton signature , it would be a strong hint at our scenario",
    ". references  @xcite considered photon jets ( two or more collimated photons ) at hadron colliders . in particular ,",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of photon conversion into @xmath19 pairs and its discriminating power between photon jets and isolated photons . for a photon jet ,",
    "the probability of photon conversion is higher than for a single photon , and ref .",
    "@xcite showed that already several tens of events are sufficient to discriminate between both hypotheses and a few hundred events allow for a @xmath399 discrimination assuming prompt photons .",
    "however , their conclusions assume a pseudoscalar mass of 1  gev and the results are very sensitive to this parameter . for long - lived pseudoscalars ,",
    "the discriminating power is reduced since photon conversion can not start before the pseudoscalar decay . as a consequence ,",
    "the discriminating power becomes worse for increasing lifetimes .",
    "apart from the diphoton signal , which is the main motivation of the current study , the nmssm parameter points discussed here also have additional distinctive features closely related to the diphoton signal .",
    "we shortly discuss these collider signatures .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the light pseudoscalar , @xmath70 , has a small branching fraction of @xmath400 for decays to electron pairs . because of its short life - time it would typically decay promptly to a highly collimated @xmath19 pair , so - called `` electron jet '' .",
    "such electron jets , prompt or displaced , were searched for by the lhc experiments as they can appear in many different models of new physics . in our case , two signatures can appear : two high-@xmath401 electron jets or one electron jet and an energetic photon .",
    "note that even though we have suppressed the branching ratio of the sm - like higgs boson to pseudoscalars such a signal is also possible apart from the decays of the heavy higgs states .",
    "for the 125  gev higgs an associated production of @xmath402 ( where @xmath403 denotes the sm - like higgs boson ) was studied by atlas  @xcite .",
    "the obtained limit is weak and together with the already mentioned suppression of @xmath404 this is an unlikely discovery channel .",
    "the searches for the direct production of the scalar decaying to two electron jets could provide further constraints , but the limits have been obtained only for the light sm - like higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this signature might become interesting in the current run once the diphoton signal is firmly confirmed .",
    "corresponding studies directly applicable to the heavy higgs particles have also been performed  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that for a hypothetical scenario with a 1  tev scalar resonance , the sensitivity of the cms search  @xcite is in the fb range .",
    "while the discussed 8  tev searches lack the sensitivity to constrain our scenario now , they clearly offer interesting prospects for observing electron decay modes of @xmath70 ( possibly accompanied by the photon jet from the opposite decay chain ) at the increased center - of - mass energy and the high luminosity run of the lhc .",
    "our scenario can also be probed via the `` classic signature '' for additional heavy neutral higgs bosons , @xmath405 , where the limits are set in the @xmath406@xmath163 space . within the mssm , assuming the additional higgs bosons at a mass around @xmath407  gev , the ( expected ) limits on @xmath163 are around @xmath408 based on run  i data  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in our nmssm scenario",
    "we have three higgs bosons with a mass around 750  gev contributing to this search channel , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath366 , where the overall number of @xmath409 events is roughly 25% lower than in the mssm , mainly due to the decay of @xmath410 .",
    "consequently , a similar , but slightly higher limit on @xmath163 can be set in our nmssm scenario .",
    "with increasing luminosity this limit could roughly improve to @xmath411@xmath203 at the lhc after collecting 3003000/fb of integrated luminosity ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the proposed scenario could eventually lead to an observable signal in the @xmath409 searches for heavy higgs bosons at the lhc , depending on the details of the scenario ( value of @xmath163 , masses of electroweak particles etc . ) .",
    "another prediction that arises for parameter points considered in this study are light higgsinos . with the masses of @xmath321@xmath329  gev they are well within the kinematic reach of the lhc . however , the small mass differences , @xmath412 , within the light higgsino sector hinder their observation at the lhc . if all the non - higgsino susy particles are sufficiently far in mass ( points * p1**p4 * , * p8 * , * p9 * ) , the decay of the second neutralino , @xmath413 proceeds almost exclusively via the light pseudoscalar @xmath70 . with the following significant branching ratio to a soft @xmath414 pair",
    "the observation in the soft di- and trilepton searches  @xcite becomes practically impossible .",
    "the radiative production at a high - energy @xmath19 collider remains a valid possibility though  @xcite .",
    "finally , light smuons are required in order to obtain phenomenologically viable muon anomalous magnetic moment and to counteract the effects of a very light pseudoscalar . for our parameter points",
    "we fix slepton masses at @xmath329@xmath330  gev . while this is close to the existing simplified model limits , see e.g.  @xcite , in our case due to the significant branching ratio @xmath415 these constraints are significantly relaxed .",
    "nevertheless , if the slepton and higgsino spectra are favorable , the observation in the current lhc run is plausible .",
    "we have proposed an nmssm scenario that can explain the excess in the diphoton spectrum at @xmath0  gev recently observed by atlas and cms . in our scenario",
    "the heavy neutral ( and charged ) higgs bosons have a mass around @xmath416 , while one light cp - odd higgs boson has a mass around the mass of the pion , @xmath417 .",
    "the @xmath0  gev excess is generated by the production of the heavy neutral cp - even higgs bosons , which subsequently decay to two light pseudoscalars .",
    "each of these pseudoscalars then decays , mainly via the mixing with the @xmath18 , to a collimated photon pair that appears as a single photon in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the mass gap between heavy higgses of @xmath418 mimics a large width of the @xmath380 peak .",
    "furthermore , the production of the heavy neutral cp - even higgs bosons may contain a large component of @xmath419 initial state , thus ameliorating a possible tension with @xmath3  tev data compared to other production modes .",
    "the main virtue of our scenario is that all necessary properties to fit the signal can be united in a phenomenologically realistic way within as theoretically simple a model as the nmssm , without e.g.  requiring additional ad hoc matter .",
    "we derived the nmssm parameter space in which this scenario can be realized .",
    "it is characterized by a heavy higgs boson mass scale , @xmath46 , around @xmath380 . the yukawa - like couplings @xmath32 and @xmath33 are found to satisfy @xmath420 and @xmath280 .",
    "the @xmath12 parameter is given by @xmath421 , or @xmath422 .",
    "we furthermore find @xmath423 , @xmath424 and @xmath425 . due to this choice of parameters",
    "the two neutral heavy cp - even higgs bosons are strongly mixed doublet / singlet states and the light cp - odd higgs boson can have a mass around @xmath426 .",
    "the light cp - even higgs boson with sm - like properties can have a mass around @xmath427 , mainly by choosing the scalar top parameters accordingly .",
    "the parameter choice furthermore forbids a large decay rate of the sm - like higgs boson to the two light cp - odd states , which would be in contradiction with the lhc measurements .    in order to validate our scenario",
    "we have chosen nine benchmark points , all satisfying the above constraints , but with a strong variation within the allowed intervals . using state - of - the - art tools , including higher - order corrections ,",
    "these points have been analyzed to reproduce the observed `` excess '' in the diphoton search at the lhc run - ii , including detector simulation and efficiencies .",
    "we have furthermore checked explicitly that these points fulfill all other experimental constraints .",
    "these include lhc higgs ( and susy ) searches , higgs boson rate measurements , as well as flavor observables and electroweak precision data .",
    "we have shown explicitly that the two collimated photon pairs would be seen as a single photon each , applying the same settings as in the atlas / cms analyses .",
    "finally , we have analyzed how our scenario can be probed in the upcoming continued lhc run - ii .",
    "possibly striking features are the absence of any other relevant decay mode , such as the decay to massive gauge bosons , as well as an increased rate of photon conversion to electron jets with respect to the `` simple '' diphoton decay mode , or the distinction of a photon pair from a single photon",
    ". furthermore , the heavy neutral higgs bosons should be visible in the conventional @xmath409 searches at high luminosity .",
    "other characteristic features of our scenario are relatively light higgsinos and possibly sleptons that can be probed at the lhc run - ii . using these characteristics , our scenario should be distinguishable from most other physics scenarios that have been proposed to explain the lhc diphoton `` excess '' .",

    "<S> a mass gap between heavy higgses mimics a large width of the @xmath0  gev peak . </S>",
    "<S> the production mechanism , containing a strong component via initial @xmath2 quarks , ameliorates a possible tension with @xmath3  tev data compared to other production modes . </S>",
