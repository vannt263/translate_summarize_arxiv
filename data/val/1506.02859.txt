    "[ sek1 ] that , all curves related to the different anisotropy in the exchange interactions have tricritical points , at which plotted phase diagrams end . at this point , the second order magnetic phase transition meets the first order one .",

    "besides , when we compare the value of the critical temperature in the case @xmath84 , we can see that this value is slightly lower than the value obtained within the da @xcite , which is @xmath85 . thus it is expected that , the critical values are slightly lower than the da @xcite for the anisotropic heisenberg model .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in order to investigate the behavior of the hysteresis loops with the variation of the hamiltonian parameters , we can use quantities which are related to the shapes of the hysteresis loops , namely hysteresis loop area ( hla ) , coersive field ( cf ) and the remanent magnetization ( rm ) . since the evolution of the hysteresis loops with the variation of the temperature is trivial",

    "but for the values that provide @xmath88 , the @xmath79 axis becomes hard direction and when the value of @xmath78 lowers , the spins tend to align in @xmath89 plane , which can be regarded as easy plane .",
    "thus we can say that , the disordered phase of the system can be related to the random alignment of the spins in @xmath79 direction ( @xmath86 and @xmath90 ) , as well as random alignment of spins in @xmath89 plane ( @xmath88 ) .    in order to see the effect of the crystal field on the hysteresis behavior",

    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) and ( [ sek4 ] ) ( a ) at large negative values of crystal field ) we can say that this nonzero hla do not originate from the symmetric hysteresis loops around the origin .",
    "because of the large negative values of the crystal field , the system can not stay in the ferromagnetic phase , then the hysteresis loops of this region correspond to the paramagnetic phase . since corresponding cf and rm values are zero at large negative values of the crystal field , with nonzero hla there has to be loops which are not symmetric about the origin in the @xmath93 plane .",
    "the hysteresis loops for selected hamiltonian parameter values from this large negative valued crystal field region can be seen in fig .",

    "[ sek5 ] that , the loops related to the anisotropic heisenberg model lie inside of the loops for the ising model .",
    "this is consistent with the results shown in figs .",
    "[ sek2]-[sek4 ] , which conclude that , decreasing anisotropy ( i.e. rising @xmath17 ) causes to a decline in the hla , rm and cf .",

    "[ sek5 ] ( d ) is double hysteresis behavior .",
    "when the crystal field decreases , first the hysteresis loops get narrower ( compare loops in figs .",
    "[ sek5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) , then after a specific value of @xmath78 , loops start to split up ( see [ sek5 ] ( c ) ) , after this double hysteresis loop behavior survives .",
    "this result can explain the constant and nonzero behavior of the hysteresis loops with decreasing @xmath78 , at constant temperature .",
    "since the large negative value of @xmath78 forces the spins to align in @xmath89 plane , the double hysteresis loop behavior , which appears in large negative values of the crystal field may come from the forced alignment of the spins from this plane to the @xmath79 direction .",
    "we can see this situation by defining a quantity @xmath100 , which is the measure of the number of spins aligned in @xmath89 plane . in fig .",
    "[ sek6 ] we depict the `` hysteresis '' loops for the @xmath101 , with same parameters used in fig .",

    "[ sek6 ] ( d ) , magnetic field can induce the transition to alignment of the spins from the @xmath89 plane to the @xmath79 axis , when the value of the magnetic field large enough .",
    "this situation is consistent with the results given in fig .",
    "[ sek5 ] .",
    "we can summarize these results as : the decreasing crystal field gives rise to double hysteresis behavior .",
    "this double hysteresis loop behavior comes from the transition between the states which are consist of aligned spins in @xmath89 plane and spins in @xmath79 direction .",
    "this mechanism is different from the mechanism which explains the hysteresis behavior in positive valued crystal field .",
    "the double hysteresis loops have been observed experimentally in different systems , for example in mn- doped ( pb , la ) @xmath102 ceramics @xcite , and in @xmath103 superlattices @xcite . in addition , triple hysteresis behaviors have been observed experimentally , such as single chain magnets with antiferromagnetic interchain coupling @xcite and in molecular - based magnetic materials @xcite , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 multilayered nanowires @xcite .    in theoretical explanations ,",
    "this double ( or triple ) hysteresis loop behaviors mostly attributed to the exchange interaction ratios in the nano material .",

    "it is observed that , when the absolute value of @xmath108 increases , then the hysteresis curve changes from one central loop to triple loops @xcite . also , it was shown within the eft formulation based on a probability distribution method that , trimodal random field distribution on the s-1 ising nanotube could give rise to double hysteresis loops when the system passes from the ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic one @xcite .",
    "in addition to such studies , we show in the present work that , double hysteresis loop behavior can also occur in bulk systems as explained above .",
    "lastly , one important study deals with the s-1ising model with transverse crystal field ( in @xmath109 direction ) within the eft with probability distribution technique @xcite . in this work the authors can not find double hysteresis loop behavior due to the transverse alignment of the crystal field .",

    "the effects of the crystal field and anisotropy in the exchange interaction of the anisotropic s-1 heisenberg model on the hysteresis behavior have been obtained within the effective field theory with two spin cluster .",

    "the value of @xmath17 makes no important difference in the hysteresis loops in low @xmath113 and positive @xmath78 region .",
    "however in the negative @xmath78 region one fundamental distinction appears for hysteresis loops that have different values of @xmath17 , namely double hysteresis loop behavior .",
    "double hysteresis loop behavior appears for low values of @xmath113 and @xmath17 , when @xmath78 takes large negative values .",
