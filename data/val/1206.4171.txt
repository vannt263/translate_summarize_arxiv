    "a two - level transition of the central ion is driven by two laser pulses separated by a time interval @xmath5 and which perform a @xmath1 and @xmath4 rotation of the dipole , respectively .",

    "figure  [ fig : signals](c ) , finally , corresponds to the situation when the equilibrium configuration of the crystal is always a zigzag , which experiences a shallower potential when the central ion is excited . here , the quench is also associated with a displacement of the equilibrium positions .",
    "similar to case ( b ) , the signal decays and exhibits revivals .",
    "the decay of the visibility in ( b ) and ( c ) arises from the entanglement of the spin excitation with the crystal degrees of freedom , and the revivals are a signature of quantum coherence that is stored in the whole system .",
    "similar revivals have been experimentally observed for a single trapped ion  @xcite .",
    "they are here an intrinsic property of the many - body system and , as we will argue in the following , are a scalable feature that appears close to criticality .",
    "+   +    the details of the model that determine the properties of the overlap integral , and thus of the visibility , are reported in the next section .",
    "we note that in eq .",
    "we assumed that there is no mechanical effect associated with photon absorption and emission .",
    "this is the case when the internal transition is excited by means of a radio - frequency field  @xcite , or by a raman transition with co - propagating beams  @xcite .",

    "we shall consider that the ions vibrate about their classical equilibrium positions , with displacements from equilibrium that are much smaller than the inter - particle distance  @xcite .",
    "this situation can be achieved by laser cooling a hot cloud of ions confined in an electromagnetic trap , e.g. a paul or penning trap  @xcite.the spin - dependent potential can be an optical potential , like a tightly focussed laser beam propagating along and aligned with the chain axis , as discussed in  @xcite . since this potential depends on the internal state",

    "one observes a main peak corresponding to the mode whose frequency goes to zero when @xmath63 approaches @xmath183 and the crystal in the excited state becomes unstable .",
    "close to @xmath183 one observes two signals which become more visible , that are at twice the zigzag eigenfrequency and at the sum of the zigzag mode frequency with the axial breathing mode frequency .",
    "they hint at the presence of single - mode and multimode squeezing due to the quenching , suggesting that some entanglement between the modes is generated by the quench .",
    "we now summarize our findings . in the first place",
    ", the visibility decays fast to zero when the quench is performed between motional states whose classical equilibrium configurations differ .",
    "the decay is faster when the two structures have different symmetries , and thus different spectral properties , such as when the quench is across the phase transition linear - zigzag .",
    "nevertheless , the visibility exhibits revivals as a function of the time after the quench .",
    "these revivals occur at the frequency of the lowest normal mode of the zigzag structure , which becomes unstable at the instability and corresponds to the zigzag mode of the linear chain .",
    "this mode is in fact the one which has the largest overlap with the difference between zigzag and linear structures .",
    "this feature of the visibility is scalable , the periodicity of the revival remains in fact finite as the size of the chain is increased .",
    "the height of the peaks , however , decays as @xmath6 is scaled up , consistently with the fact that the amplitude of excitation of the zigzag mode by a displacement of the central ion decreases as the size of the chain is increased . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "hence , the surviving feature is the decay of the visibility signal at short times , corresponding to the fact that the quantum superposition of the spin irreversibly dephases .",
    "when instead the quench is between two linear chains , there is a quasi - periodic rephasing of the system , corresponding to the creation of squeezing by sudden changing the trap frequency and thus the normal mode frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations decays to zero while the visibility reaches a constant value which approaches unity as @xmath63 is increased .",
    "before we conclude this subsection , we remark that the dynamics we consider in this paper is unitary : decay of the overlap signal is solely due to dephasing in the dynamics of internal and external degrees of freedom , while external sources of decoherence and noise have been neglected .",
    "they are expected to introduce a damping factor in the overlap signal , setting an upper bound for partial revivals decreasing with time .",
    "some estimates have been already provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was argued that for the parameters of existing set - ups the revivals of the visibility should be observed . in particular , the main source of noise in ion traps is considered to be patch potentials at the electrodes  @xcite . the measured heating rates depend strongly on the actual set - up of the experimental apparatus , the smaller heating rates which have been reported correspond to timescales of the order of several milliseconds , which would allow one to observe several revivals of the visibility .",
    "the other important point regards the assumption that the chain is initially in the ground state of the vibrational excitations .",
    "ground state cooling of ion chains composed to up to 4 ions have been successfully demonstrated in  @xcite , the visibility signals is degraded as the temperature @xmath195 of the chain is increased .",
    "the functional dependence of the visibility on @xmath195 is subject of ongoing studies .",
    "the dynamical properties of an ion crystal after a quench have been theoretically investigated , when the quench is performed by creating coherent superpositions of motional states close to and across the linear - zigzag structural transition .",
    "these dynamics have been related to the visibility of the signal when ramsey interferometry is performed on one ion of the chain .",
    "the visibility decays at short times as the internal state becomes entangled with the motional state of the crystal , but exhibits periodic revivals at longer times , determined by the frequency of the zigzag mode .",
    "further periodic signals appear at multiples of the zigzag mode and at sums of different motional excitations , suggesting squeezing and entanglement in the vibrational motion generated by the quench of the trap frequency .",
    "these spectral properties persist as the number of ions increases , even though the heights of the revivals decrease .",
    "these results are based on a theoretical model which we report in detail and which allows one to calculate the visibility for different parameter regimes .",
    "this model is valid as long as as the harmonic theory of the crystal is applicable and is thus reliable for the parameters we consider in this paper .",
    "our analysis shows that , if the crystal is initially in the motional ground state , these features can be observed for parameters that are consistent with ongoing experimental work .",
    "the signal is however degraded as the temperature is increased , the functional dependence of the visibility signal on the chain temperature is object of ongoing studies .",
    "we conclude by observing that the visibility signal allows one to study the behaviour of the soft mode across the classical phase transition",
    ". extensions of these studies to the parameter regime where quantum effects at the phase transition are relevant  @xcite would allow one to extract the corresponding quantum fidelity , in the spirit of the work performed in  @xcite , and will be subject of future studies .",

    "@xmath217 can be written as @xmath218 we take the derivative of @xmath211 and obtain a first - order differential equation which contains all operators .",
    "the contributions from @xmath219 and @xmath220 cancel out by choosing @xmath221 , so that @xmath222 $ ] , hence demonstrating eq .  .",
    "this procedure can be generalized to show the equality @xmath223 } e^{-\\frac{\\tanh\\lambda}{2}a^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath224 are the annihilation and creation operators of a harmonic oscillator .    moreover",
    ", we can use the procedure sketched above in order to disentangle the multimode squeezing operator : @xmath225 with @xmath226 this can be done after observing that , since @xmath227 is complex symmetric , we can perform takagi s factorization  @xcite @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is unitary and @xmath230 is diagonal with @xmath231 real and non - negative ( this factorization exists for any complex symmetric matrix ) .",

    "therefore , operators of different modes factorize as @xmath237 , and one finally obtains @xmath238 the terms belonging to different modes commute now , so bringing factors with operators @xmath239 to the left and factors with @xmath240 to the right and writing them as a function of operators @xmath241 and @xmath242 , one obtains eq .  .",
