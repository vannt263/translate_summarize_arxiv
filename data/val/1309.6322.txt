    "for more than one hundred years , formidable work has gone into recording and preserving optical images of the celestial sphere .",
    "coordinated large - scale efforts began with the carte du ciel project ( see review by * ? ? ? * ) and continued with dedicated , deep surveys such as those carried out with the palomar oschin schmidt and the uk schmidt telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres , respectively .",
    "the photographic plates from these surveys have been digitized and processed by several groups to create the digitised sky survey ( dss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and all - sky astrometric and photometric catalogs such as the us naval observatory - b catalog ( usno - b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the second generation guide star catalog ( gsc - ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the digitized palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the supercosmos sky survey ( sss ; * ? ? ?",
    "ongoing efforts such as the digital access to a sky century at harvard ( dasch ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are processing hundreds of thousands of plates of shallower depth to provide hundreds of epochs of photometry over the entire sky .    these data , when combined with modern very wide - field optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ?",
    "* ) , provide more than fifty years of astrometry from which very high quality proper motions can be derived over a large part of the sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the long time baselines between observations also have a high legacy value for the study of optical variability .",
    "the investigation of long period variable stars , cataclysmic binaries , quasars and the search for rare objects such as novae and r crb stars all benefit from observations that span decades or more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for example , the timing of outbursts from recurrent novae , changes in the periods of mira variables , and observations of late thermal pulses such as those from fg sge @xcite or wise j1810 - 3305 @xcite provide insight into the late stages of stellar evolution and mass loss",
    ". however , the photometric accuracy of historical catalogs is typically much worse than modern optical photometric surveys . indeed , the authors of usno - b state that the photometry is probably the weakest aspect of the catalog @xcite .",
    "the lack of accurate photometry and the presence of spurious objects in such catalogs diminish their legacy value .    in this paper , we present an effort to improve the photometry of tens of millions of point sources over time scales spanning 60 years .",
    "we take advantage of the high photometric accuracy of sdss to recalibrate a large fraction of usno - b and to create a precision multi - band two - epoch photometric catalog .",
    "we develop a careful recalibration process that maximizes the size and reliability of the catalog while minimizing the presence of spurious objects or unreliable photometric measurements .",
    "we make the full catalog publicly available and include metadata that describe the quality of the data . in  [ sec : source ] , we describe our source catalogs , the cross - matching procedure , spurious objects , and the common photometric system . in  [ sec : pre - flag ] , we describe a process for identifying blended objects .",
    "we outline the photometric recalibration in  [ sec : recal ] , followed by the identification of anomalous magnitudes in  [ sec : consistent ] .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : results ] and include a comparison of our results with previous work by others . the limitations of the catalog are given in ",
    "[ sec : limitations ] .",
    "we provide suggested applications of the catalog in  [ sec : applications ] and summarize our work in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "a flowchart summarizing our work is shown in figure [ fig : flowchart ] ; the reader is advised to refer to this figure throughout the paper .",
    "the usno - b catalog is a compilation of optical astrometric and photometric measurements for more than a billion objects over the entire sky @xcite .",
    "it is derived from digital scans of original or glass copies of 7,435 schmidt plates that were taken between 1949 and 2002 as part of the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , eso / serc , and anglo - australian observatory uk schmidt surveys @xcite .",
    "the catalog provides up to five photometric measurements for each object in five bands ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; named after the plate emulsions ) .",
    "the five bands are alternatively referred to as one of three colours : blue ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , red ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and infrared ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the effective wavelengths of bands @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath1 4100 , 6500 , 4700 , 6600 , and 8400  with full - width at half - maxima of @xmath1  1500 , 450 , 1500 , 800 , and 1700 , respectively .",
    "@xcite report that the photometry is complete to @xmath10 mag , although this varies by up to @xmath1 2 magnitudes from plate to plate .",
    "the five filter measurements were taken at different epochs ; the time between epochs varies from hours to decades .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the catalog is @xmath1 0.2 ; this is the median dispersion of the positions of a given object imaged on multiple overlapping plates .",
    "the catalog matches objects on plates from different epochs to calculate proper motions .",
    "however , these proper motions are normalized to another astrometric catalog , and hence they are relative and not absolute .",
    "the photometric accuracy for point sources in usno - b is difficult to estimate , but is reported by @xcite as 0.3 mag .",
    "this number is the standard deviation of the photometric solution among a large set of calibration stars .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite and demonstrated by @xcite , the systematic uncertainty in the photometry can often exceed 0.3 mag by several magnitudes .",
    "for the purposes of this work , there are a few advantages of using the usno - b catalog over other historical catalogs that are based on many of the same photographic plates , such as the guide star catalog @xcite , the supercosmos sky survey catalog @xcite , and the digitized second palomar observatory sky survey @xcite .",
    "the usno - b catalog has a wider range of epochs and/or sky coverage compared to other catalogs . as noted by @xcite , usno - b",
    "has a higher threshold for rejecting possible false detections ( e.g. , plate artifacts / defects , diffraction spikes ) and therefore includes many real objects that are not reported in other catalogs .",
    "most importantly , the original survey and plate identification are reported for every object , enabling a robust and accurate photometric recalibration ( see  [ sec : recal ] below ) .",
    "several of the poss , eso / serc , and aao surveys used plates that overlap , i.e. a small fraction of the plates cover the same part of the sky .",
    "these overlap regions were used to aid in the photometric calibration . however , the photometry of each cataloged object in usno - b is from a single plate .",
    "we also note that within overlap regions , objects grouped together by plate identification do not always form a distinct boundary on the sky .",
    "we selected all objects in usno - b that lie within @xmath11 of the areal footprint of the dr9 catalog of sdss - iii ( @xmath1 14,500 deg@xmath12 ) .",
    "the extra @xmath11 boundary is included to allow for the cross - matching of objects with large or inaccurate proper motions .",
    "a total of @xmath1 260 million objects satisfy this criterion ( see figure [ fig : flowchart ] ) .",
    "approximately 77% of these usno - b objects were observed as part of one of the poss surveys for all five bands ; the remaining 23% were observed as part of the southern eso / serc or aao uk schmidt surveys in at least one band .",
    "the usno - b catalog does not provide directly the epoch of the photometry for every object .",
    "we derived the ut date and time ( at mid - exposure ) for most entries in the catalog by using the plate identifications and data available through the image and catalog archive hosted by usno .",
    "this resource provides information for all of the ` blue ' and ` red ' , i.e.  the @xmath13 and @xmath9 bands .    for most of the `",
    "infrared ' @xmath5 band plate epochs , we used data available through the german astrophysical virtual observatory .",
    "a small number of @xmath5 band plates ( 25 ) were taken as part of the serc - i survey but were assigned plate identifications from poss - ii infrared ( ir ) survey ; these plates filled in gaps in the northern poss - ii ir survey .",
    "we identified the epochs for 14 of these 25 plates in the mikulski archive for space telescopes .",
    "the epochs for the remaining 11 @xmath5-band plates ( @xmath14 1% of the sky ) are unidentified .",
    "objects that are on plates with unidentifiable epochs remain in the list of @xmath1 260 million objects , but are noted as having missing epochs .",
    "all of the epochs ( @xmath15 ) are recorded in units of decimal years with a precision of 10@xmath16 years , for a temporal resolution of @xmath1 1 hour ( the exposure time for individual plates varies from @xmath1 5 minutes up to 3 hours ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is an ongoing effort to obtain high precision photometry and spectroscopy of a large fraction of the northern sky @xcite .",
    "the survey commenced in the year 2000 and provides nearly simultaneous imaging in five optical and near infrared bands ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the survey is now in its third phase ( sdss - iii ) and has made data available through data release 9 ( dr9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dr9 imaging data cover more than 14,500 deg@xmath12 with a 50% completeness limit for point sources of @xmath18 mag ( about one magnitude fainter than usno - b ) , and a relative photometric accuracy of @xmath19 .",
    "the global absolute astrometric precision of the survey is 01 ( rms ) ; the reported proper motions are based on the method described in @xcite .",
    "dr9 provides five band photometry for @xmath20 470 million unique stars , quasars and galaxies .",
    "it provides additional five band photometry for @xmath20 320 million objects derived from repeat observations of the same part of the sky . to avoid ambiguity , we only consider ` primary ' measurements , i.e.   those that are classified as the ` best ' observation for each object .",
    "we also exclude objects that have moved during the @xmath1 70 seconds that elapse between observation in different filters ( e.g. , main belt asteroids ) .",
    "we further refine our selection in order to choose appropriate objects that can be robustly matched to those in usno - b .",
    "the full list of our selection criteria applied to dr9 are :    1 .",
    "the object is classified by dr9 as an unresolved point source , e.g. a star or quasar .",
    "the classification is accurate for objects brighter than @xmath1 22 mag @xcite .",
    "this criterion applies to about half of all unique objects ( @xmath1 260 million ) .",
    "we exclude galaxies because the photometric calibration in usno - b is not appropriate for extended sources .",
    "2 .    the object s magnitude is brighter than that at which the completeness of usno - b is less than 10% ( @xmath21 or @xmath22  22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this enables the cross identification of objects with extreme colours or those that are potentially variable objects that were brighter than the usno - b sensitivity limit at the usno - b epoch .",
    "this criterion reduces the sample to @xmath1 99 million objects .",
    "the object was observed under photometric sky conditions or was calibrated based on overlaps with calibrated data ; this reduces the sample size to @xmath1 90 million objects .",
    "the photometric pipeline reports that the object has reliable photometry in each of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands .",
    "this criterion excludes objects that are saturated ( @xmath26 12 mag ) , are near the chip edge , have a bad point spread function ( psf ) , are not deblended accurately , etc .",
    "this reduces the sample to @xmath1 77 million objects .",
    "the proper motion is reported as reliable , following the recommendations of @xcite .",
    "this criterion uses the results of @xcite and requires that an object is a ) matched to exactly one usno - b object within 1@xmath27 ( after a correction for proper motion ) ; b ) is identified on four or more usno - b plates , and c ) has an uncertainty in each celestial coordinate of @xmath28 0.35 .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite do not report the identity of the match in usno - b ( see  [ sec : xmatch ] below ) .",
    "this criterion reduces the sample from dr9 to @xmath1 44 million objects .",
    "we convert the mean time of the observations in the @xmath29 , and @xmath25 bands for each object to decimal years with a precision of 10@xmath16 years , the same precision as for the usno - b epochs .",
    "the full details of the selection criteria , including the constraints on various photometric flags , are given in appendix [ sec : app ] .",
    "an accurate comparison between objects in usno - b and dr9 requires a careful cross matching between the two catalogs , incorporating proper motion measurements .",
    "for example , the longest interval between the photographic plate and dr9 observations is @xmath1 60 years ; the distribution of time intervals between observations is shown in figure [ fig : histo epochs ] .",
    "( note that some @xmath5 band observations were taken more than 2 years after the sdss data . ) over the course of 60 years , 10% of the dr9 objects have moved by more than 1 .",
    "the proper motions reported by dr9 are calculated using the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite do not report the identities of the cross matched objects .",
    "in addition , while their proper motions are placed in an absolute reference frame , they are based on the less accurate proper motions reported by usno - b itself .",
    "consequently , we performed an independent cross matching procedure described below .",
    "the usno - b catalog reports celestial coordinates at the equinox j2000 and at epoch 2000.0 .",
    "the usno - b coordinates were converted by @xcite to epoch 2000.0 using the proper motions reported by usno - b itself .",
    "these proper motions are only relative measurements , not absolute , and suffer from a larger uncertainty compared to those of @xcite . for example",
    ", about 500,000 objects in usno - b have proper motion values that differ by more than 10 milli - arcseconds per year from their proper motions in dr9 .",
    "the dr9 catalog reports celestial coordinates at the equinox j2000 but at the epoch of each individual dr9 observation . in order to account for these discrepancies in the coordinate systems in the two catalogs ,",
    "we cross match our sample of usno - b and dr9 objects in two stages .    in the first stage ,",
    "we convert all dr9 objects to the epoch 2000.0 using the proper motions reported in dr9 .",
    "we then match all usno - b objects with valid coordinate uncertainties to dr9 objects ( at epoch 2000.0 ) using the quad - tree cube algorithm of @xcite .",
    "we allow for multiple objects in each catalog to be matched to multiple objects ( many - to - many ) with a large matching radius of 30 .",
    "the large matching radius was chosen to correct for potentially highly incorrect proper motions reported by usno - b .",
    "in the second stage , we convert the coordinates of each preliminarily matched usno - b object back to the mean epoch of the corresponding usno - b observation using the proper motions reported by usno - b .",
    "( this mitigates the potentially adverse effects of incorrect usno - b proper motions . )",
    "we then convert these coordinates to the epoch 2000.0 using the dr9 proper motion of each of their cross matched dr9 counterparts .",
    "we recalculate the angular separation between each matched usno - b and dr9 pair and retain the closest match .",
    "we discard objects with a minimum angular separation @xmath30 1@xmath313.5@xmath3 ) .",
    "the final ( one - to - one ) cross matched catalog contains 43,873,069 objects , as shown in figure [ fig : flowchart ] .    unless specified otherwise , references to dr9 and usno - b objects in the rest of the paper refer to this sample of @xmath1 44 million objects and not to other data those catalogs .",
    "the usno - b catalog is known to contain many objects that are not astrophysical @xcite .",
    "defects or emulsion flaws in the original plates , satellite or meteor trails , and optical artifacts near bright stars are reported as objects in the original catalog .",
    "we chose our selection criteria for dr9 objects in (  [ sec : dr8 ] ) to strongly suppress the inclusion of these artifacts .",
    "for example , it is unlikely for plate artifacts to have reliable proper motions and to be matched to point sources in dr9 .    in order to quantify the potential contribution of spurious sources",
    ", we compared our cross matched catalog to the results of @xcite .",
    "they used computer vision techniques to identify diffraction spikes and annular reflection halos among the entries in usno - b .",
    "they took advantage of the common spatial pattern among these optical artifacts to detect them automatically .",
    "they found that @xmath1 2% of entries are identified as spikes or halos . by comparison ,",
    "0.06% of objects in our cross matched catalog are classified as spikes or halos by @xcite .",
    "this implies that our selection criteria have reduced the rate of spurious sources by a factor of 2/0.06 = 30 .",
    "however , this also shows that @xmath1 24,000 objects in our catalog are classified as spurious .",
    "the automatic classification scheme of @xcite is statistical and some objects classified as spurious may be real .",
    "we therefore retain these potentially spurious objects in our catalog and note that they may not be real ( see table [ tab : columns ] below ) .      in order to compare accurately the photometry of objects in usno - b and dr9",
    ", the photometric measurements must be placed onto a common system .",
    "this can be done by carefully selecting well - calibrated , cross - matched objects in both catalogs and constructing a transformation function through a least - square minimization scheme , as done by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite from a sample of objects in sdss early data release , data release 1 , and data release 2 , respectively .",
    "however , the usno - b photometry suffers from large systematic errors and requires recalibration @xcite .",
    "in addition , any relative changes in magnitude between the two catalogs , such as those caused by variability , are not very sensitive to the particular transformation functions . therefore in order to avoid the introduction of conflicting photometric conversion systems , we adopt the transformations from the sloan system to the usno - b system as originally described by @xcite . for each usno - b band ,",
    "the transformations are : @xmath32 where @xmath21 and @xmath25 are the point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes reported by dr9 in the relevant band ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 band data are not used here ) .",
    "dr9 reports multiple magnitudes for each object using several different algorithms ; the psf magnitudes are more accurate than the model magnitudes or composite model magnitudes also listed for each source ( see  [ sec : limitations ] below ) .",
    "@xmath35 are the magnitudes of a dr9 object in the usno - b system ; we use @xmath36 as the generic term for these magnitudes .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath37 to refer to the original magnitudes of a usno - b object in the usno - b system ; we use @xmath38 as the generic term .",
    "we calculate the uncertainty in @xmath36 using the 1@xmath3 errors reported by dr9 in each filter and propagating them according the equations above .",
    "these errors are generically referred to as @xmath39 .    for several of the historical surveys on which usno - b is based ,",
    "different filters were used with plates of the same emulsion . in principle",
    ", a distinct photometric system should be created for each unique combination of emulsion and filter . however , the usno - b data require a full recalibration ( described below ) and the recalibration process implicitly accounts for the effect of different filters .",
    "we therefore avoid introducing the complication of multiple photometric systems for each band .",
    "there are several astrophysical objects in usno - b with photometry that may be adversely affected by their proximity to other objects , either astrophysical or artificial in origin .",
    "it is important to identify such objects with inaccurate photometry in order to minimize their influence on the photometric recalibration process described in ",
    "[ sec : recal ] below .",
    "there are two cases for which the photometry may be inaccurate because of this effect .",
    "one case is where the photometry is influenced by proximity to artifacts from very bright stars .",
    "the other case applies to objects that are very close to one another and suffer from adverse effects of blending .",
    "the two cases are discussed below in  [ sec : blend bright ] and  [ sec : blended ] , respectively , and are summarised in figure [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "our selection criteria for dr9 objects excludes bright stars but does not exclude objects that are near bright stars ( step # 4 in  [ sec : dr8 ] ) .",
    "the dr9 pipeline measures accurately the brightness of objects near bright stars ( or reports that it can not be measured reliably ) . however",
    ", usno - b does not measure these objects accurately and it does not indicate if the measurements are reliable .",
    "a visual inspection of photographic plate and dr9 images ( along with dr9 and original usno - b magnitudes ) shows that there are many objects within a few arcminutes of bright stars that have highly inaccurate usno magnitudes , even those that are not on diffraction spikes or near the edge of reflection halos .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure [ fig : thumbnail bright star ] .",
    "we identify all usno - b objects that are within an exclusion radius of a bright star . because the asymmetric artifacts near bright stars are not well fit to a model",
    ", we calculate the exclusion radius empirically from a visual inspection of plate images . for each usno band , we inspect a large sample of images in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) available through the skyview virtual observatory .",
    "the images are of the same plates ( or glass copies ) of ones used to create usno - b .",
    "the images are centered on bright stars in the tycho-2 catalog @xcite .",
    "we chose up to 5 randomly selected stars in 20 narrow magnitude bins for stars brighter than 12th magnitude ; we found that stars fainter than this do not have spikes or halos and are well fit by gaussian point spread functions .",
    "for each image , we estimate the maximum angular radius of the spikes or halo centred on the bright star .",
    "this subjective estimate of the radius is conservative ; we chose a radius that was well outside the visible optical artifacts .",
    "this method is also insensitive to the lossy compression of the dss images .",
    "the results of the visual inspection are shown in figure [ fig : bright star width ] .",
    "the filled circles show the maximum radius of artifacts for the sample of stars in each magnitude bin .",
    "the vertical dotted lines show the full range of estimated radii of artifacts in each bin .",
    "a least - squares model fit to the filled circles is shown as a solid line .",
    "we use the parameters of this model to estimate the exclusion radius for every bright star in the usno - b catalog . for this calculation",
    ", we use the magnitude from tycho-2 rather than the magnitude reported by usno - b ; usno - b magnitudes are not reliable for these bright stars . for usno bands @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 , we used the tycho @xmath40 magnitude ; the @xmath41 magnitude was used for bands @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 .    any object that falls on or within the exclusion radius of a bright star",
    "is classified accordingly .",
    "for each usno - b band , there are @xmath20 200,000 - 700,000 of these tagged objects in the cross matched catalog ( @xmath1 1% of entries ) .",
    "note that the practical limitation on visually inspecting every bright star implies that there could be objects with inaccurate photometry near bright stars that are missed by this process .",
    "we note that our model fits in figure [ fig : bright star width ] compare favourably to the results of @xcite who measured similar parameters with computer vision techniques ( cf . their figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "however , we can not use the cleaned usno - b catalog of @xcite because it only removed objects in narrow annular rings from halos and objects that are part of diffraction spikes ; their catalog did not remove real objects that are very close to bright stars . the number of objects that we identify as being near bright stars is more than an order of magnitude greater than those classified as spikes or halos by @xcite . through the identification of these objects ,",
    "we improve significantly the reliability of the photometry of the objects in our catalog .",
    "we used a different process to identify objects that are blended with very nearby objects ( but are not bright enough to cause optical artifacts ) .",
    "the typical full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of point sources on the usno - b photographic plates ( @xmath1 3 ) is much greater than the median @xmath24-band fwhm of point sources in dr9 ( 13 ) .",
    "this creates two undesirable possibilities when comparing objects in usno - b with those in dr9 :    1 .",
    "two or more adjacent objects within usno - b can have overlapping full - width half - maxima . in this case , the magnitude of one or more of these objects may be severely over- or under estimated in usno - b .",
    "one object in usno - b may be cross matched to a dr9 object that has one or more other dr9 objects very nearby . in this case , the single usno - b object may actually be a blend of two more objects that are resolved in dr9 .",
    "an example of this situation is shown in figure [ fig : thumbnail blended sdss ] .",
    "we determine the apparent angular sizes of usno - b objects empirically , using dss images of randomly selected , isolated point sources spanning a wide range of magnitudes .",
    "we calculate the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of more than 175 objects per band from a two - dimensional gaussian fit to each star .",
    "the hwhm was taken to be the larger of the widths in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and only circular fits ( axis ratio between 0.8 and 1.2 ) are recorded . objects with non - circular widths are not used in this calculation .    the results are shown in figure [ fig : faint star width ] .",
    "we find a non - linear negative correlation between hwhm and the usno - b magnitude , @xmath38 , with a typical range of half - widths of @xmath44 .",
    "we fit models consisting of second - order polynomials ( with a constant minimum value at faint magnitudes ) to the data ; the least - squares best fits are overlaid in figure [ fig : faint star width ] .",
    "we calculate the hwhm of every object in the cross matched catalog using the best fit model parameters .    in order to assess whether a usno - b object is blended in scenario ( 1 ) above ,",
    "we calculate the angular separation between all pairs of usno - b objects .",
    "an object and its neighbors are tagged as blended if the angular distance to any neighbor is less than the linear sum of the hwhm of the object and its neighbor . in each band ,",
    "@xmath1 1.5 million objects ( @xmath45 of entries in our cross matched catalog ) are tagged this way .    in order to assess if a usno - b / dr9 cross matched object is blended under scenario ( 2 ) , we calculated the angular separation between all pairs of objects within the original dr9 ( of which the dr9 objects described above in  [ sec : dr8 ] are a subset ) .",
    "if we had only considered objects in our cross matched catalog , several usno - b objects would be classified incorrectly as unblended . for this superset of objects in dr9 , we select all objects that could have been detected on the original usno - b plates .",
    "we selected point sources and extended sources , and relaxed the selection criteria for some of the photometric pipeline flags ; this superset contains @xmath1 200 million objects ( see appendix [ sec : app b ] for the full list of selection criteria ) .",
    "we calculate the hwhm of the superset of dr9 objects using the composite model magnitudes from dr9 converted to the usno system .",
    "the composite model magnitude is the linear combination of an exponential model fit and a de vaucouleurs model fit that best fits the image ; the psf magnitudes are not appropriate because we have included non - stellar sources in the sample .",
    "we tag a usno - b object as blended if its angular distance to a dr9 object ( that has an overlapping hwhm with another dr9 object ) is less than the sum of the hwhm of the dr9 objects .",
    "for each band , there are @xmath20 500,000  1 million objects ( @xmath1 1%-2% of entries ) that suffer from this kind of blending ; more than 80% of these blended objects are tagged as blended in more than one band .",
    "a simpler , alternative approach to identifying blended objects is to require that an object in one catalog is matched to exactly one object in another catalog within a large radius , as done by @xcite .",
    "however , our empirical approach accounts for the variable effective size of objects and retains genuine objects that might have been otherwise rejected .",
    "our method also takes into account the higher angular resolution of the dr9 images compared to those from which usno - b were derived .",
    "another approach is to consider the classification flags provided by usno - b that distinguish stellar from non - stellar objects .",
    "however , the relatively low accuracy of the classification ( @xmath1 85% ; * ? ? ? * ) and the large number of objects in our cross matched catalog implies that a large number of false objects would be retained and a large number of real objects would likely be removed if this was adopted .",
    "the photometry in usno - b suffers from systematic inaccuracies that exceed the reported errors .",
    "the authors of usno - b point out that the photometry is the weakest aspect of the catalog @xcite .",

    "the deficit of objects in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : weird histos ] near @xmath48 mag is likely due to a mismatch of the calibration curves ; the ` pileup ' of objects at one value of magnitude in the other panels is likely due to an anomalous calibration curve .    by taking advantage of the high photometric accuracy of dr9",

    "the reason is that a number of steps in the recalibration process are dependent explicitly or implicitly on the photometry of the dr9 counterparts ( discussed in detail below ) .",

    "they refer to the work of @xcite , which describes a similar algorithm in more detail using data from sdss dr2 .",

    "this table is based on the recalibration work of @xcite .",
    "there are several key differences between the algorithms of @xcite and @xcite compared to our work .",
    "our selection of data from the sdss data is more restrictive and is designed to suppress the inclusion of spurious usno - b objects . we identify objects that may suffer from blending effects in a robust way , and exclude them as calibration objects",
    "when determining the blended status of objects , we account for the variation of object size with magnitude .",
    "we also account for the variable magnitude limits on each plate rather than adopting a fixed cutoff for the entire catalog . during the recalibration",
    ", we reject bad model fits based on the distribution of parameters from all model fits .",
    "we have found a number of causes for the spurious nature of large amplitude variable candidates and have implemented automated techniques for identifying them .",
    "we compare our results to other historical catalogs based on the same photographic plates as an additional check on the quality of the recalibration . by using the tags for unblended and consistent objects , most of the large amplitude variable objects in our catalog",
    "are real ( see  [ sec : limitations ] below ) . finally , we provide object identifications and epochs in our catalog that enable the analysis of variable objects in a convenient way .",
    "none of these were done by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "our catalog is significantly larger compared to the catalog of @xcite , primarily because of the larger areal coverage of dr9 relative to dr2 . in each band , there are @xmath1 30  40 million objects in our catalog that have photometry that is likely to be reliable ( quality flag equal to 0 ) .",
    "this number is about a factor of 15 larger than the number of objects in @xcite that are reported to have good photometry .",
    "quantitative illustrations of the differences between our results and previous work are shown in figures [ fig : histo sesar ] and [ fig : histo aihara ] .",
    "figure [ fig : histo sesar ] compares our results with the publicly available data from @xcite in the @xmath6 and @xmath8 bands ; data for the other usno - b bands is not publicly available .",
    "we selected objects from @xcite that are identified by them as having good photometry .",

    "the figure shows that for objects with @xmath105  mag , our recalibrated data have a distribution that is significantly narrower and more symmetric than those recalibrated by @xcite .",
    "this implies that for objects with large values of @xmath106 , many of the recalibrated magnitudes reported by @xcite are likely to be inaccurate .",
    "the claim by @xcite that their candidate variables are not dominated by spurious sources is not likely to be true for the most highly variable candidates .",
    "figure [ fig : histo aihara ] compares our results with the recalibrated usno - b magnitudes available through dr9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a12 ) .",
    "the dashed red and dotted blue lines show @xmath99 and @xmath107 from a12 , respectively , for the same objects ( the area under the curves are identical ) .",
    "note that a12 do not indicate the quality of the recalibrated magnitudes ; we show the recalibrated usno - b magnitude of every object in our catalog ( but with @xmath108 from a12 ) .",
    "the solid black line shows @xmath101 from our catalog for the same objects , but with the constraint that the objects are tagged as unblended and consistent with other catalogs ( the area under the black curve is smaller than the red and blue curves ) .",
    "the figure shows that many of the recalibrated magnitudes reported by a12 are inaccurate and they offer little or no improvement over the original usno - b magnitudes , especially for objects with @xmath109 mag .",
    "our selection criteria and recalibration process are designed to maximise the size and reliability of the catalog while minimizing the presence of spurious objects or unreliable photometric measurements .",
    "however , there is a very small percentage of objects with inaccurate photometry in our catalog . in order to quantify the degree of contamination , we visually inspected dss and sdss images centered on the objects with the 100 highest values of @xmath100 ( i.e. , @xmath110 mag ) .",
    "we only considered objects that are not spikes or halos (  [ sec : spurious ] ) , are unblended (  [ sec : blended ] ) , are away from bright stars (  [ sec : blend bright ] ) , are consistent with external catalogs (  [ sec : consistent ] ) , and have reliable uncertainties (  [ sec : recal 2 ] ) .",
    "we find that 32% of these objects have abnormal properties that strongly indicate that they are not genuine variables .",
    "the most common abnormal properties are , in descending order :    1 .",
    "the object overlaps with an artifact on a usno - b plate and was not removed by our selection criteria (  [ sec : dr8 ] ) or recalibration (  [ sec : recal ] ) ; this affects 16% of the sample .",
    "two examples of this are shown in figure [ fig : thumbnail artefacts ] .",
    "these objects could be detected automatically through psf fitting to images or through other computer vision techniques .",
    "note that these artifacts do not appear to be associated with bright stars and therefore are not classified as artifacts by @xcite .",
    "the proper motion of the object or of other objects very nearby is inaccurate ; this affects 5% of the sample .",
    "this can lead to one of two adverse scenarios .",
    "one scenario is where an object is blended at the epoch of the usno - b measurement ( but reported as a single object in the usno - b catalog ) .",
    "however , it is not blended at the dr9 epoch because the blended object has moved outside the blending ` radius ' .",
    "therefore it is not identified as a blended object .",
    "this usually happens for objects with underestimated proper motions ; see figure [ fig : thumbnail proper motion ] for an example .",
    "another situation is where a stationary object is reported to have a large proper motion in usno - b and , as a result , is matched to the wrong dr9 object .",
    "almost all of the objects that suffer from either of these effects are from the earliest epoch measurements in usno - b ( i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath8 bands ) .",
    "the brightness of the object in usno - b is overestimated because the object is blended with one or more very faint stars , or with an extended galaxy , or with a bright star .",
    "this affects 5% of the sample .",
    "these objects are not tagged as blended because the objects they are blended with were not included in the ` superset ' of dr9 objects described in ",
    "[ sec : blended ] and appendix [ sec : app b ] .",
    "however , relaxing some of the selection criteria would introduce a large number of objects that are either a ) not astrophysical , or b ) do not have reliable photometry .",
    "the usno - b magnitude is inconsistent with nearby objects of similar brightness on the same plate .",
    "this applies to 4% of the sample and occurs when the gsc - ii or sss magnitude is also incorrect .",
    "the radial profile of the light from the object appears to be more consistent with a galaxy rather than a star or quasar .",
    "this typically occurs for objects with profiles that have a bright core and symmetric , extended wings ; it is found in 1% of the sample . in these cases ,",
    "the flux reported by usno - b is overestimated and it is not appropriate to use the psf magnitude in sdss .    we compared the number of spurious large amplitude variables in our catalog with the results of @xcite .",
    "there are a factor of 240 more objects with @xmath111 mag in @xcite compared to the number of unblended and consistent objects our catalog .",
    "if we assume that a ) there are the same number of genuine large amplitude variables in the two catalogs and b ) 67% of objects in our catalog with @xmath112 mag are genuine , then the probability that a large amplitude variable candidate is genuine is a factor of 240/0.67 @xmath1 360 higher for our catalog than for @xcite .",
    "a similar comparison of our data with the @xcite catalog shows that the probability that a large amplitude variable candidate is genuine is a factor of 58 times higher for our catalog than for @xcite .",
    "however , we caution that a visual inspection of plate images is still recommended in order to rule out a non - astrophysical cause for apparent variability of any particular object .    without visually inspecting all the images ,",
    "it is difficult to estimate precisely the fraction of variable sources across the catalog that are real .",
    "however , we manually inspected a random sample of 500 objects with @xmath87 mag and found that for 98% of them , the variability could not be attributed to any of the reasons listed above .",
    "this implies that the probability that a variable candidate is genuine is significantly larger for objects with smaller values of @xmath100 .",
    "another limitation to our catalog is that it can not be used to identify objects that are transient , e.g. objects that are detected in one of usno - b or dr9 , but not in the other .",
    "therefore there is an upper limit to the largest change in magnitude that we can identify ( about 6 magnitudes ) .",
    "most of the reliable objects in the catalog ( @xmath30 99% ) are bounded by 14 @xmath113 20 ; the bright end is usually set by the condition that objects are not saturated in dr9 and the faint end is set by the sensitivity of the photographic plates from which usno - b are derived . in principle , transients could be identified by searching for bright objects in dr9 that have no usno counterparts .",
    "the reverse scenario would be overwhelmed with artifacts and other spurious sources .",
    "we also note that our avoidance of extended sources means that this work is not sensitive to detecting extragalactic supernovae associated with resolved galaxies .",
    "one principal application of the catalog is that of an accurate historical archive .",
    "the catalog provides an accurate photometric record of stars and quasars over @xmath1 1/4 of the sky over the past @xmath114 60 years . with the growing number of wide - field surveys at all wavelengths ,",
    "the catalog is a valuable resource for retrieving accurate optical magnitudes and colors over long time periods . a star or quasar that is in the original usno - b catalog and within the dr9 footprint , but is _ not _ in our catalog implies that the usno - b photometry is not likely to be correct .",
    "figure [ fig : histo mags ] shows the distribution of recalibrated magnitudes ( @xmath73 ) for all objects in our catalog ( solid black ) and for those that are candidate variables at the 4@xmath3 level ( dashed blue ; see  [ sec : vars ] below ) .",
    "the figure shows that the sensitivity of usno - b ( the mode of the frequency distribution ) is approximately 20.0 , 18.5 , 20.0 , 19.0 , and 17.5 mag for bands @xmath54 and @xmath5 , respectively . in order to minimise the probability",
    "that an object in our catalog is spurious , we recommend applying a filter that only selects objects with an artifact tag equal to 0 , a quality flag equal to 0 and consistency flag that indicates the photometry is in agreement with other catalogs .    to aid the comparison of our catalog to other surveys , we have derived the transformation from the ( recalibrated ) usno - b photometric system to sdss .",
    "this transformation was calculated by selecting cataloged objects that are unblended , not near artifacts of brights stars , and have reliable uncertainties .",
    "we minimized the absolute difference between the dr9 magnitude and ( @xmath73 ) and calculated the following transformation functions : @xmath115 where @xmath116 are psf magnitudes from dr9 in the sdss system , and @xmath117 are the recalibrated usno - b magnitudes in the usno - b system .",
    "we caution that the transformation may be inaccurate for objects with usno - b colors that deviate significantly from 0.0 .",
    "after the transformation , the standard deviation of the difference between the sdss and usno - b magnitudes is @xmath1 0.12 mag .",
    "these transformation functions are provided as a convenience to users of the catalog ; the values of @xmath21 and @xmath25 from equations [ eq : usno1 ] - [ eq : usno3 ] are not given in the catalog .",
    "another principal application of the catalog is the identification and analysis of stars and quasars that vary optically over time scales of up to 60 years ( see figure [ fig : histo epochs ] ) .",
    "the combination of the large sky coverage , sensitivity , and long time scales makes the catalog suitable for discovering optical outbursts from rare objects such as dwarf novae @xcite and fu ori stars @xcite , or the dimming of rare r crb stars @xcite .",
    "the size of the catalog makes it suitable for studying the ensemble properties of variable quasars or subclasses of common variable stars ( e.g. rr lyrae , miras , eclipsing binaries , etc . ) with a photometric accuracy of @xmath1 0.1 mag .",
    "an accurate classification of the variable objects ( not provided by our catalog ) is required for a robust analysis , and such a classification is best done through multi - wavelength photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "we note that approximately 570,000 objects in our catalog ( @xmath1 1.3% ) have optical spectra available through dr9 that could be used to aid in the classification .",
    "the classification could also be assisted through the repeated observations in sdss ; there are one or more additional photometric measurements in dr9 for @xmath1 2.8 million objects in our catalog ( @xmath1 6% ) .",
    "however , single - epoch optical colors are still a useful indicator of an object s classification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : all stars cmd ] shows a color - color diagram of @xmath1 37 million objects in our catalog , using the single - epoch @xmath118 and @xmath119 colors from sdss dr9 .",
    "the magnitudes have been corrected for interstellar extinction using the dust model of @xcite and assuming the dust acts as a foreground screen to each object . to avoid areas of the sky where the dust correction is very large and therefore uncertain ( e.g. near the galactic plane )",
    ", we only show objects with extinction corrections of 2.0 magnitudes or less in each sdss band .",
    "the color bar scale shows the density of objects in color - color space .",

    "the dashed red lines outline the boundaries defined by @xcite that are used to classify point sources",
    ". the locus of points near @xmath122 are consistent with low - redshift quasars , and the locus of points near @xmath123 are consistent with rr lyrae stars .",
    "figure [ fig : var stars cmd ] again shows the density of cataloged objects in color - color space , but only for a subset of the objects in figure [ fig : all stars cmd ] .",
    "this subset consists of 74,062 objects that have significantly different magnitudes in usno - b compared to dr9 in the usno - b @xmath7 band .",
    "only objects that are variable at the 4@xmath3 level , i.e. @xmath1244@xmath125 , are shown .",
    "each object is also constrained to have a quality flag equal to 0 and to be consistent with gsc - ii .",
    "( the distributions of variables in color - color space for other usno - b bands are very similar to figure [ fig : var stars cmd ] and hence are not shown . )",
    "the fraction of objects with colors that are consistent with low - redshift quasars is 35 times higher for the variables ( 27.8% ) than for the catalog as a whole ( 0.8% ) quasars are well known to vary in the optical over a range of time scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this is consistent with our results .",
    "in addition , more than 80% of the 4@xmath3 candidate variables that have spectra in dr9 are classified spectroscopically as quasars ; this fraction is four times higher than the number of quasars among all objects with dr9 spectra .",
    "a quantitative comparison between the two figures also shows that the number of objects with colors consistent with rr lyrae stars is five times higher for the variables ( 2.6% ) than for the catalog as a whole ( 0.5% ) .",
    "these results show that the combination of variability and single - epoch colors could be used to increase the classification accuracy .",
    "we note that our results are consistent with a similar analysis performed by @xcite , however our sample size of candidate variables ( @xmath1 74,000 ) is a factor of 25 larger than their sample ( @xmath1 3,000 ) .",
    "with such a large catalog of candidate variables , it is interesting to note how many of these objects may be new discoveries .",
    "there are 247,511 unique objects that meet our criteria for 4@xmath3 variables in at least one of the usno - b bands ; the distribution of @xmath73 for these objects is shown in figure [ fig : histo mags ] as a dashed blue line . note that the criteria for 4@xmath3 variables in our catalog includes two additional requirements : that the quality flag is equal to zero , and the consistency flag is set to true .",
    "we include a column in our catalog ( table [ tab : sample ] ) that indicates if an object meets these criteria .",
    "the distribution of @xmath101 as a function of @xmath36 for these variable candidates is shown in figure [ fig : delta mag vars ] .",
    "we compare our candidate variable objects with those in the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) international variable star index ( vsx ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vsx is a compilation of entries in several catalogs of optically variable stars , e.g. , the general catalog of variable stars @xcite , the northern sky variability survey @xcite , and the optical gravitational lensing experiment @xcite , along with newer discoveries reported by aavso members and confirmed by aavso staff .",
    "the vsx catalog is updated weekly and provides a classification of the variable stars of all types . as of 2013 june 30 , the catalog contains entries for 243,610 variable stars .",
