    "the study of resolved photon processes  @xcite i.e. , photon induced processes where the partons in the photon take part in the ` hard ' scattering process , is useful to improve our understanding of the interactions of high energy photons with other hadrons as well as with each other .",
    "in addition , these processes serve as an extra laboratory to study aspects of perturbative and nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the status of the study of the ` resolved ' processes at hera and tristan / lep , in relation to the measurements of 2gam  at the   colliders like",
    "petra / pep / tristan / lep , is similar to the study of large  jet production at isr which confirmed the parton structure of proton which had been revealed in the dis experiments at slac .",
    "the first experimental verification of the ` resolved ' processes came at tristan @xcite .",
    "the higher energy and statistics at hera @xcite have since then provided a lot of interesting information about photons and their interactions , in the study of these processes  @xcite . in this",
    "talk i summarise the current experimental information on 2gam  and highlight interesting features of the new analysis of jet production in resolved processes at hera .",
    "i discuss the role that the study of resolved contributions can play in clarifying our understanding of the dynamics of the charmonium production .",
    "i will then proceed to discuss new issues such as resolved processes with photons of nonvanishing virtuality as well as the experimental determination of the transverse momentum ( ) distribution of partons in the photon .",
    "lastly i will talk about predictions for  of an eikonalised minijet model , which uses the above measurement .",
    "as is well known the photon structure function 2gamdescribes the ` strong ' interactions that the @xmath0 developes through @xmath1 vertex . a large amount of data on 2gam  has been accumulated in",
    "the ` hard ' @xmath2 dis scattering in the single tag  experiments since the first measurements of 2gam  by pluto @xcite .",
    "the predictions of perturbative qcd have two basic features :    * 2gam  rises linearly with @xmath3 and the scaling violations are of an entrirely different nature as compared to the case of the proton structure function . * the parton densities in a photon  peak at large unlike the parton densities in a proton .",
    "both these features have been experimentally verified .",
    "[ fig1 ] , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , shows the expected linear rise of integrated 2gam  ( a factor of @xmath4 has been taken out ) with @xmath5 .",
    "a few more points can be made .    1 .   the measurements of 2gam  , along with certain theoretical assumptions about the charm quark contribution , yield directly the  for light quarks over a wide range of @xmath6 : @xmath7 , and upto @xmath8 .",
    "the gluon distribution  is obtained from the dis measurements only indirectly , using qcd evolution equations .",
    "the charm quark distribution in photon , is correlated with the gluon distribution  and is not at all well determined . lep2 offers a good chance for its determination .",
    "4 .   as opposed to 1984 , when there was only one parametrisation  @xcite for , obtained using fits to the early dis data , now at least twenty different parametrisations  @xcite ( inlcuding lo and nlo fits ) are available . these are not just different fits but involve different assumptions about the nonperturbative part of the 2gam  and hence an accurate determination of  will test these assumptions as well .    as a result of 1 ) above the  in all the parametrisations are very similar .",
    "it is not so for .",
    "this can be seen from    fig .",
    "hence , it is important to be able to obtain information about  from alternative sources .",
    "production of high  jets in effective  and  collisions , which can be studied in photoproduction experiments at @xmath9 collider ( hera ) and in no - tag two - photon experiments in  colliders ( tristan , lep ) , was found to be dominated by the ` resolved ' contributions @xcite and hence a good place to study the gluon density in the photon .",
    "although the original experimental observation  @xcite of the resolved contribution was in jet production in  collisions , the more recent experimental and theoretical developement has happened in the study of jet production in resolved processes in  collisions .",
    "the    two diagrams in fig .  [ fig3 ] , give the ` direct ' and ` resolved ' contributions respectively . in the ` direct ' ( ` resolved ' )",
    "processes all ( only a fraction ) of the photon energy is available for the hard scattering process .",
    "hence the fraction of the photon energy carried by the jets , , is @xmath10 for these two processes .",
    "this can separate the two processes if  can be reconstructed experimentally .",
    "note here that a neat separation between the two in terms of the diagrams is possible _ only _ at the lo level . at nlo",
    "one has to be more careful in the separation between the two in the theoretical calculations .",
    "however , operationally the difference between the two is clear : only for the resolved processes does one have a remnant jet activity in the direction of the photon ( i.e. the electron ) .",
    "this , along with the other two original predictions  @xcite , viz .",
    ", that the ` hard ' resolved jets will be closer to the proton direction than for the ` direct ' process and that the former will dominate upto large values of , were qualitatively confirmed by the earliest measuements .",
    "the dijet angular distributions expected in the lo direct(resolved ) contribution are @xmath11 corresponding to the spin 1/2(1 ) exchange in the subprocess responsible for the jet production .",
    "the  in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , is essentially the fraction of the photon s momentum that appears in the high - jets . as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the angular distributions obtained by separating between the resolved and direct processes based on @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , show this difference quite clearly .    as a matter of fact early study of the differential distributions of the inclusive jet cross - sections , showed that photonic parton densities as given by the lac3 parametrisation , which was already disfaovured by the  jet data , was quite strongly ruled out , despite the uncertainties in the analysis which we shall mention next .    since the early analysis ,",
    "newer developements have been theoretical nlo calculations  @xcite and the incorporation of these in the analysis of the newer 1994/1995 hera data  @xcite . even using lo analysis",
    "some general observations can be made .",
    "it is seen @xcite that the dominance of the inclusive jet spectrum by the resolved contributions is somewhat reduced from the naive expectations , by stricter jet cuts ; however , sensitivity to the   can be increased by rapidity cuts .",
    "it is therefore indeed possible  @xcite to try and use the data on inclusive jet photoproduction and dijet photoproduction to determine the .",
    "however , inspite of the clear _ qualitative _ evidence for the resolved processes provided by the data , a detailed analysis had showed certain discrepancies between the data and theoretical predictions at low   and high @xmath14 of the jet .",
    "it was realised that part of this is caused by the ` underlying ' event which can also contribute to the transverse energy activity around a ` hard ' jet . in the ` resolved ' events the remnant photon jet causes changes in the hadronic activity of the event as compared to the direct events .",
    "it was demonstrated  @xcite that choice of a cone angle of 0.7 rather than the ususal 1.0 , is more appropriate for photoproduction of jets in the resolved processes .",
    "[ fig5 ] , taken from @xcite , shows that indeed the data are well described by the nlo calculations for all  and @xmath14 . in general ,",
    "the data are better described by a mc which includes multiple interactions ( mi )  @xcite .",
    "the h1 data  @xcite also show a direct correlation between the energy flow outside the jet and , again demonstrating the importance of an underlying event and need to understand it completely to analyse the dijet and inclusive jet data .",
    "the dijet data have been used to extract an effective photon structure function given by @xmath15 , by h1 in anology to the @xmath16 case .",
    "the dijet data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , taken from  @xcite .",
    "the effective parton densities in the photon shown in fig.[fig6](b ) show a striking linear rise with @xmath5 . however , the present data and analyses do not distinguish between the recent nlo parametrisations like grv , sas and gs  @xcite .",
    "the above discussion shows that the analysis of the inlcusive jet cross - sections and dijet data has now come of age .",
    "a combined analysis with the jet data from  experiments , both tristan and lep-2 , along with the hera data , are likely to increase our understanding of the photonic parton densities .",
    "our increased knowledge of the protonic parton densities from hera will play a very important role here .",
    "the gluon distribution of a target is probed effectively if one can isolate hard processes where the gluon contributes dominantly . both at hera and at the  colliders ,",
    "the direct photon and heavy quark production are subjects of experimental investigations to get more information about .",
    "the event rates for these are much smaller than the for jet production .",
    "however , the extra information they can provide makes the study well worth it . for direct photon studies ,",
    "complete nlo calculation is available @xcite . in the case of resolved processes",
    "there are additional technical issues involved as compared to the corresponding @xmath17 case , due to the additional contributions coming from the fragmentation of a parton into a photon .",
    "all of these issues have been satisfactorily addressed in the theoretical calculations .",
    "the experimental investigations have just started  @xcite and the experiment has demonstrated the ability of picking out the direct photon events . unlike the case of jet production , here",
    "the resolved contribution , though signficant , is not dominant .",
    "the current sample shows clearly only the existence of the direct contribution . but",
    "analysis of more data certainly holds promise .",
    "heavy quark and quarkonium production is mostly dominated by the direct contributions and the use of these to determine   requires 1 )  a good knowledge of the  and 2 ) good set of cuts to separate the two from each other . actually , since heavy quark production at hera is used as a probe for determination of  the latter",
    "are essential for that purpose as well . the same kinematic feature which makes the jets in resolved processes come out closer to the proton direction , can be used to isolate the two by using simple rapidity cuts  @xcite .    in case of quarkonium production",
    "the second use of study of resolved processes is manifest .",
    "the dynamics of quarkonium production and the colour octet contribution to the production , has been a subject of a lot of attention in the past few years .",
    "the size of the colour octet matrix elements as extracted from the hera data and from the tevatron data are in disagreement .",
    "one possible explanation is the apparent breakdown of some of the basic assumptions of the nrqcd calculations in the region of large inelasticity @xmath18 .",
    "as has been discussed elsewhere in the proceedings  @xcite , it has been shown that the colour octet resolved contribution to @xmath19 production , dominates at small inelasticity of @xmath19 , where the uncertainty in the nrqcd calculations is small .",
    "hence studying the @xmath19 production at small @xmath18 at hera will help pin down the the colour octet matrix elements and shed light on the discrepancy and might even rule out  @xcite the nrqcd model of @xmath19 production .",
    "this is where one can see the use of resolved processes as a laboratory of qcd .",
    "study of inclusive charm production at hera can also be used to obtain an effective lo measurement of the charm density  @xcite .",
    "there also one can use effectively the same rapidity cuts as mentioned above to separate the much more abundant direct contribution .",
    "thus the field of better determination of gluon and charm quark density in the photon using the abovementioned hard processes is just opening up .",
    "theoretically the gluon and the charm densities in the photon are correlated .",
    "the perturbative part of @xmath20 is easily calculable .",
    "it is the nonperturbative part , which can not be calculated , that is closely correlated to the .",
    "the upcoming analysis of the two photon data will offer a way to measure the charm contribution to 2gam  and hence shed more light on the issue .",
    "in a hadron like proton the internal transverse momentum distribution of the partons is taken to be normally gaussian . however , in the case of photon since the parton content can in principle be traced back to a hard @xmath21 vertex , the transverse momentum distribution is expected to be different .",
    "it is expected to be @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "zeus performed a determination of this distribution by essentially measuring the transverse momentum of the remnant jet ( i.e the jet in the direction of the electron ) in a jet event .",
    "this measures the  distribution of the parton which participated in the hard scattering process .",
    "the measurement by zeus  @xcite gave a distribution in ageeement with the above expectation and yielded a measurement of @xmath23 gev , this is indeed a preliminary measurement .",
    "inclusion of such intrinsic  has also improved the agreement with data on dijet rates and transverse momentum distribution in  scattering in the analysis by opal . in the next section",
    "i will discuss an eikonalised model prediction for  which makes use of this measurement .",
    "the parton densities in virtual photon can be completely computed in perturbative qcd when the virtuality of the photon ( @xmath24 ) is much higher than @xmath25 . for quasi real photons",
    "@xmath26 the parton densities can not be calculated from first principles , but those are the ones that are parametrised from data . since , in most photon - induced processes , the contribution to the resolved cross - sections from virtual photons will be significant only for low virtuality , @xmath27 , it is essential to have a model for these  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of jet production with virtual photons with small but _ nonvanishing _ virtuality , is now avalaible from h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite both .",
    "the current results are well described by some of the available parametrisations  @xcite .",
    "however , feasibility of the measurement is demonstrated and we can expect more results from the analyses .",
    "the resolved contribution to hard processes , like jet production ( say ) , increases strongly with the energy of the photons . as a matter of fact",
    "it was observed  @xcite that the minijet cross - section , _",
    "minijet()|_^s _ d d ( ) [ sigjet ] is completely dominated by the resolved contribution and rises like a power of @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is the square of the centre of mass energy .",
    "this combined with the phenomenon of beamstrahlung can cause very large backgrounds at the future linear colliders  @xcite . to assess this correctly one has to see how much of this rise gets reflected in the rise of total inelastic cross - sections .",
    "this is also another example where investigations in issues involving resolved processes , function as a theoretical laboratory . to that end here",
    "i will describe a model for the calculation of total inelastic cross - section in minijet model , trying to make a special effort to determine the various parameters / inputs from the data involving resolved photons rather than as model assumptions .",
    "the ` minijet ' cross - section has to be eikonalised so that unitarity is not violated . in general for photon induced processes , the inelastic cross - section obtained by eikonalisation ( and hence unitarisation ) of the minijet cross - section is given by @xmath29\\ ] ] with the average number of collisions at a given impact parameter @xmath30 given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability that the colliding particles @xmath33 are both in a hadronic state , @xmath34 describes the transverse overlap of the partons in the two projectiles normalised to 1 , @xmath35 is the non - perturbative part of the cross - section while @xmath36 is the hard part of the cross  section ( of order @xmath37 or @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively ) .",
    "notice that , in the above definitions , @xmath41 is a cross - section of hadronic size since the factor @xmath42 has already been factored out .",
    "we have , @xmath43 the overlap function @xmath34 is then , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fourier transform of the b - distribution of partons in the colliding particles .",
    "normally , @xmath46 is obtained using for @xmath45 the electromagnetic form factors of the colliding hadrons . in general , for photons people have normally used the form factor for a pion .",
    "we  @xcite take a slightly different approach and calculate the ` b- distribution ' of the partons by taking the fourier transform of the transverse momentum distribution of the partons , which in the case of the photons is expected to be , at least for the perturbative part , f ( ) = c ( k_t^2 + k_0 ^ 2 ) . as said in the earlier section @xmath47",
    "has actually been measured by zeus to be @xmath48 gev .",
    "it turns out that the form of @xmath49 with this transverse momentum ansatz and that for the pion form factor ansatz , are the same , differing only in the value of the parameter @xmath47 which is @xmath50 gev for the @xmath51 form factor case . thus one can asses the effect of changing the ansatz for the @xmath46 for photons by simply changing the value of @xmath47 .    for the soft part of the cross - section we use a parametrisation ,",
    "@xmath52 we then calculate values for @xmath53 and @xmath54 from a best fit @xcite to the low energy photoproduction data , starting with the quark parton model ( qpm ) ansatz @xmath55 and the form factor ansatz for the @xmath56 . the best fit value for   that we get is 2 gev",
    ". it might be possible to improve quality of the fit by using a energy dependent , but this needs to be investigted further .",
    "the value of 2 gev is also comparable to the value 1.6 gev obtained  @xcite from a fit to the description of minimum bias events in @xmath57 collisions .    for @xmath40 collisions",
    ", we repeat the qpm suggestion and propose @xmath58 we now apply the criteria and parameter set used in @xmath39 collisions to the case of photon - photon collisions , i.e. @xmath59 , @xmath60 gev , a(b ) from the transverse momentum ansatz with the value @xmath61 gev . the results of our calculation are shown    fig .",
    "[ gamgam ] .",
    "the highest of the two full lines corresponds exactly to the same parameter set used in the photoproduction case and appears to be in good agreement with the preliminary results from the opal  @xcite collaboration , whereas the l3 results  @xcite , everything else being the same , would favour a higher @xmath47 value .",
    "the following can be noticed here from the newer data and model calculation :    * the data on  rise faster with the energy than the predictions of the regge - pomeron ideas and the rise is consistent with predictions of the eikonalised minijet models where the parameters are fixed by fits to the photoproduction case . *",
    "these calculations use also more uptodate photonic parton densities and the parameters of the eikonalised minijet model are related here to measured properties of photon induced reactions .",
    "thus we see that the hera data have really lived upto the expectations  @xcite that the photoproduction data , dominated by the resolved processes , would yield information on the photon structure .",
    "the study of two photon processes at the  collider lep2 , and further analysis of heavy flavour ( closed and open ) production , direct photon production at hera is sure to give more information on the parton content of the photon as well as on the way high energy photons interact with each other and matter .",
    "in addition the resolved processes are proving their potential as a laboratory for qcd .",
