    "in a recent feuilleton @xcite we agitated for serious consideration of the possibility that the grand unification gauge group becomes strongly coupled above the scale of perturbative unification ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this behaviour is inevitable in any gut containing higgs fields capable of giving realistic fermion mass relations ( fm higgs ) at tree level @xcite since the casimir indices of such representations are generically large and hence drive the gauge coupling into the strongly coupled regime above their mass thresholds ( the problem is especially acute in so(10 ) susy guts that employ * 126 * -plets but the behaviour is generic ) .",
    "we argued that the almost superstitious avoidance of asymptotically strong ( as ) models in the literature was unjustified . the intuitive picture that emerges when the basic reversal of roles between the perturbative gauge non - singlet and the confined gauge singlet phases is accounted for , is quite appealing and does not violate any canon .",
    "rather it raises the possibility of quite novel solutions and insights into the hoary puzzles of unification physics .",
    "even if unrealized in nature it would constitute a remarkable logical completion that needs no banishment to the realm of the unthinkable .    reversing the usual logic that sees fermion masses as a peripheral or second order issue relative to the primary fact of symmetry breaking we argued that their necessity in an important component of the inner rationale for symmetry breaking in the standard model ( sm ) and guts .",
    "the sm ensures an observable electromagnetic u(1 ) gauge symmetry only by ensuring that all charged particles are in fact massive .",
    "if this were not so then the massless charged particles would completely screen the u(1 ) charge at low energies thus rendering it unobservable .",
    "moreover there are other pathologies associated with massless charged particles ( of any spin ) in both quantum and classical dynamics and this makes it all the more plausible that ensuring their absence in the sm via the formation the higgs condensate is a rationale behind the formation of the higgs condensate itself .",
    "the sm fermion mass spectrum is thus an important clue for the choice of higgs representations and so to the mode of symmetry breaking of the gut in which the sm is embedded . in a truly minimal ( tm ) model the low energy fermion mass and gauge coupling data and the fermion mass ( fm ) higgs representations needed to fit",
    "it should determine the pattern and modality of unification completely . in our proposal",
    "it is the low energy data itself that forces us to take seriously the possibility of strong gauge couplings above the gut scale .",
    "else we must abandon painstakingly developed and otherwise sensible ( susy ) guts e.g @xcite where the presence of @xmath2 is used to implement see - saw mechanisms for neutrino mass in an so(10 ) susy gut while preserving r - parity to low energies .",
    "the casimir index of these two higgs multiplets alone is thrice that of the gauge fields !",
    "furthermore , the presence of effectively exact supersymmetry at the gut scale ( @xmath3 ) fairly cries out for exploitation , given all the attendant simplifications .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of `` realistic '' sqcd where the supersymmetry breaking scale completely dominates the condensation scale ( @xmath4 ) and relegates the conclusions derived from susy qcd largely to the realm of the qualitative @xcite and the inapplicable .",
    "as we have shown elsewhere @xcite susy makes the analysis of symmetry breaking patterns and phenomenology tractable even in very complex models .",
    "the enhanced analyzability is conferred by the special holomorphicity and non renormalization properties of supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "thus n=1 strongly coupled susy guts are prime candidates for application of the techniques developed for the analysis of phase portraits of susy gauge theories @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , asymptotically strong ( as ) models have received at most passing mention in the enormous literature devoted to the dynamics of susy gauge theories . from time to time , the possibility of as unified theories ( albeit with considerably larger gauge groups than standard guts ) has been resurrected @xcite but no particular merit of uniqueness or genericity has been available to justify the extensions proposed .",
    "moreover it was unclear how any significant step beyond the bald statement of uv strength could be made about the uv dynamics of such theories and its relevance to the structure of the low energy theory .",
    "in @xcite we proposed that the ( scale inverted ) analogy of as theories with familiar strong coupling qcd dynamics suggests a very appealing intuitive picture of the effect of as .",
    "since the low energy and long distance theory is weakly coupled the principal effects of the strong coupling in the uv are likely to be in the formation of condensates that break gauge symmetry and thus define the vacuum of the perturbative effective gauge theory at larger length scales @xmath5 .",
    "such condensates would also directly modify our picture of the nature of elementary particles at the smallest scales where the gauge flux would be strongly self attracting .",
    "this picture also suggested a close connection with dual unification @xcite in which matter elementary particles are seen as monopole solitons of a dual gauge theory .",
    "indeed the dual unification picture becomes much more coherent , consistent and plausible when seen as the dual of an as susy gut ; as indeed is _ required _ by its very assumptions .",
    "for these reasons we think it necessary and possible to investigate the scenario in which fm higgs residuals with mass thresholds just above the scale of perturbative unification ( @xmath1 ) drive the gauge coupling into the strong coupling regime at a scale @xmath6 which is quite close to @xmath1 in realistic models .",
    "the energy ranges that need to be characterized divide naturally into three : * i )  * the uv strong coupled regime ( @xmath7 ) * ii ) * the perturbatively coupled supersymmetric intermediate regime @xmath8 and * iii ) * the standard low energy mssm / sm regime below the supersymmetry breaking scale : @xmath9 .",
    "we shall take the pragmatic epistemic position that the theoretical task is no more than to construct economical and minimal models within which each of these qualitatively distinct regimes can be quantitatively characterized and their dynamics _ understood _ via simple `` pictures '' of the processes involved .",
    "the relation and translation between the effective theories that characterize each regime , and their derivation from the underlying fundamental gauge theory , is @xmath10 as familiar from qcd and chiral perturbation theory @xmath10 expectedly a difficult problem that we may expect to resolve only semi - quantitatively in an analytic context .",
    "we argue that the novel interpretative context of uv condensation ( regime * i * ) and gut scale to qcd scale liberation of gauge variant degrees of freedom(regime * ii * ) makes available new - and pleasing - possibilities that can further our insight into the nature of elementarity and unification . for clarity and definiteness",
    "we choose a simple renormalizable as model consisting of n=1 susy su(2 ) gauge theory coupled to a chiral multiplet transforming as a * 5 * dimensional su(2 ) irrep and ask what are the effective theories that characterize its behaviour in the regimes described above .",
    "we make the plausible assumption that in the crucial intermediate energy perturbative regime * ii * the relevant degrees of freedom are the usual gauge non - singlet ones described by the n=1 susy ym lagrangian with a renormalizable tree level superpotential @xmath11 _ and a dynamically induced superpotential arising from non - perturbative dynamics in a manner consistent with holomorphicity , anomalies and global ( super)symmetries in complete analogy with the well established dynamical superpotentials that arise in the af case _ @xcite . in region * i * we take the relevant degrees of freedom to be (  t hooft anomaly matched ) gauge singlet chiral moduli interacting via the same dynamical superpotential as in the perturbative regime but differing in ( at least ) an independent and unknown kahler potential .",
    "we assume that the deviations from the canonical form of the kahler potential ( and the gauge kinetic chiral functions ) in the perturbative region * ii * are negligible ( see section ii ) .",
    "this ansatz is in accord with the standard picture of confinement enforced on non - gauge particles by singular wave function renormalization , and , correspondingly , the divergence of their renormalized effective masses . in the perturbative region * ii * we can extract significant information using the definition of the moduli as polynomial composites in the chiral multiplets .",
    "region * iii * or the susy ew breaking / qcd confining regime is governed by the standard mssm / sm dynamics .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we set out our scenario and intuitive picture of how an as gut works . in section",
    "iii we define and discuss the strongly coupled su(2 ) gauge plus quintet higgs model referred to above and obtain the possible vevs of the higgs fields . in section",
    "iv we discuss the pattern of dynamical symmetry breaking ( dsb ) and gaugino condensation implied by the vevs of section iii and the constraints on the dynamical superpotential that may be inferred using the konishi anomaly@xcite and decoupling arguments . in section v we discuss the lessons and implications of our simple model for the project of constructing viable realistic as guts .",
    "we conclude in section vi with a discussion of the appealing relation asguts necessarily and naturally enjoy with the dual unification picture @xcite in which the elementary particles of the sm appear as monopoles of a dual gauge group and how it resolves otherwise problematic features of those models .",
    "we thus motivate a new , supersymmetric , version of the dual unification scenario@xcite .",
    "finally we discuss the asgut novel cosmogony implied by _",
    "liberation _ of degrees of freedom by _ cooling _ in asgut thermodynamics .",
    "a plausible picture of the dynamics of as theories may be drawn using the analogy with the known features of ir strong gauge theories . the reversal of the roles of small and large length scales in the case of as theories turns the usual picture of confinement `` inside out '' .",
    "it is this conceptual leap , diametrically opposed yet closely analogous to the inbred picture of qcd and its effective low energy theory of colour singlet hadrons that jumps the barrier to realizing that as theories can be an equally consistent `` other half '' of the space of yang mills theories .",
    "when the gauge coupling becomes strong one expects gauge singlet condensates ( in particular the gaugino condensate familiar from susy qcd ) to form and to be characterized by a scale @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) at which the ( one - loop ) rg equations indicate a divergence in the gauge coupling . above @xmath14",
    "the gauge non - singlet degrees of freedom become confined due to singular wavefunction renormalizations which give them infinite effective masses .",
    "thus the residual dynamics must involve suitable gauge singlet degrees of freedom .",
    "it is natural to choose the d - flat moduli which are so central in asymptotically free ( af ) susy theories for the leading role in the as uv dynamics as well since their masses are less than the typical energies in region * i*. as in the af case the t hooft anomaly matching conditions@xcite serve as a valuable cross check of the completeness and consistency of the set of modes retained .",
    "the electric permeability of the uv condensates must exhibit the peculiar inversion referred to above : self attraction of a point particle s electric flux ( equivalently strong screening by the condensate ) implies that it should form a gauge singlet tangle or ball of size @xmath15 surrounding the putative point charge .",
    "this tangle will not be resolvable by any gauge non singlet probe : _ thus conferring an elementary size on fundamental gauge non - singlet particles_. on larger scales however the electric flux is weakly coupled and hence the gauge charge of an elementary particle will appear as the source of flux streaming out freely ( on scales @xmath16 ) from a gauge singlet core ( see fig.1 ) characterized by the gauge charge as a `` surface '' parameter ( somewhat like the quantum numbers of a black hole in the horizon - membrane picture @xcite ) .",
    "such a structure could be described as a soliton or bag of the chiral gauge singlet dynamics used to characterize the high energy phase of the theory married to the perturbative gauge theory at the core boundary .    since the gauge coupling is small below @xmath1 the low energy dynamics",
    "is a perturbative theory of gauge non - singlet particles interacting with the massless gauge bosons of the gauge symmetry left unbroken by the condensation at the uv scales .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to qcd where the perturbative dynamics is indifferent to the confining condensates precisely because the energy scales of the perturbative theory are much _ larger _ than those of the qcd condensates ( @xmath17 functions as an ir cutoff ) .",
    "our prescription for unravelling the very novel features presented by as uv condensation is thus to replace the fundamental gauge theory by effective field theories in each of the dynamical regions . for region *",
    "i * ( energy scales @xmath18 ) we propose a theory of the anomaly matched gauge singlet chiral moduli ( @xmath19 ) of the fundamental n=1 susy gauge model interacting according to a dynamical superpotential @xmath20 ( in addition there is the tree superpotential of the fundamental theory which depends on the masses and couplings @xmath21 of the chiral multiplets @xmath22 ) which represents the strong coupling dynamics .",
    "the kahler potential in region * i * @xmath23 is a highly non perturbative object representing the condensation of the moduli theory and the confinement of the gauge and gauge variant chiral modes .",
    "however one could still apply supersymmetric chiral perturbation theory techniques to it in direct analogy with the af case @xcite .",
    "many of the features of @xmath24 can be deduced or constrained on the basis of ( super)symmetry , holomorphicity and decoupling requirements @xcite . in the perturbative regime * ii * , @xmath25 , we have the _ effective spontaneously broken _ gauge theory of modes left light by the uv condensation of the gauge singlet moduli .",
    "such a theory will be described by three functions : the kahler potential @xmath26 , the superpotential @xmath27 and the chiral gauge kinetic coupling function @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on region * ii * and the effects coded in the superpotential @xmath24 assuming the kahler potential and gauge kinetic function are effectively canonical .",
    "note however that while a canonical kahler potential for the perturbative modes is a reasonable assumption , the effects of a non - canonical gauge kinetic function can be critical for issues of supersymmetry breaking in the presence of gravity @xcite .",
    "indeed it is very interesting to study@xcite the generation of non - canonical structure in this function in @xmath29 as theories ( or perturbations thereof ) where one can seek to apply the techniques developed @xcite for n=2 af theories .",
    "an important consistency check on the set of gauge singlet moduli retained in the uv effective theory of region * i * is that they should satisfy the t hooft anomaly matching conditions @xcite for the unbroken global symmetries of the model with respect to the anomalies calculated using the gauge non singlet or fundamental spectrum . in ir strong models this set",
    "is found to exclude the glueball chiral superfield @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the ( bare ) chiral gauge supermultiplet in ` holomorphic ' normalization@xcite .",
    "we also find that the anomaly matching conditions exclude s from the singlet spectrum for region i. as in the ir strong case , s plays a vital role in understanding the strong coupling condensates since the konishi anomaly @xcite furnishes the value of the gluino condensate ( i.e the scalar component of @xmath32 ) in terms of the expectation value of the chiral condensates . in the initial studies",
    "@xcite low energy effective actions were built including this glueball field .",
    "then one can code in the anomalies of the theory into the effective lagrangian since the glueball superfield @xmath32 contains @xmath33 in its auxiliary component .",
    "however it was argued @xcite that the effective low energy action can lead to misleading and ambiguous answers if only a partial set of the `` heavy '' degrees of freedom is included in it .",
    "this caveat is supported by the fact that inclusion of the glueball field s along with the singlet moduli in the effective theory typically violates the t hooft anomaly matching conditions for the unbroken global symmetries .",
    "on the other hand it is not clear that inclusion of a finite set of additional composite fields could not cancel the contribution of the glueball field .",
    "then this additional anomaly matched set , being qualitatively lighter than the coloured fields which have receded to infinite running mass , could play a useful role in describing the dynamics of modes with masses less than or near to the confinement scale or even of massless modes that could appear as bound states . in any case the action with @xmath32 can serve the useful functions described above even if it is not trustworthy for quantitative dynamics .",
    "the konishi anomaly relations@xcite are superfield @xmath34 ward - takahashi identities that arise when the non - invariance of the path - integral measure under an arbitrary chiral superfield rephasing of _ individual _ chiral superfields @xmath22 is taken into account . in the absence of sources it reads ( @xmath35 is the gauge vector superfield )    @xmath36\\phi_{(i ) } + \\phi_{(i)}{{\\partial w_{tree}}\\over { \\partial\\phi_{(i ) } } }   + { { 2t_{(i)}}\\over { 32\\pi^2 } } w^{a\\alpha } w^a_{\\alpha } \\big\\rangle \\label{kar0}\\ ] ]    the lowest component of the konishi anomaly yields a very useful set of relations involving the gaugino condensate @xmath37 and vevs of the different invariants formed from chiral superfield scalar components corresponding to the chiral invariants occurring in the tree superpotential @xmath38 :    @xmath39    there is no sum over the index @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the index of @xmath42th representation in the normalization where the fundamental is @xmath43 , and @xmath38 is the tree level superpotential of the underlying gauge theory .",
    "the vev of the anticommutator with the supercharge @xmath44 above vanishes to the accuracy that supersymmetry is preserved . on dimensional grounds",
    "its value can be tentatively estimated as @xmath45 or perhaps as @xmath46",
    ". a clearer understanding of its role can come about only once the source of supersymmetry breaking in the theory is specified ( see section 6 ) and the effect of soft supersymmetry breaking terms on the derivation of the konishi identities eqn.([kar0 ] ) determined . in eqn.([kar ] ) , in the limit of exact supersymmetry , the glueball field s is not renormalized perturbatively and nor is @xmath47 or the operators @xmath48 .",
    "thus we may expect that this relation is rg invariant and should be respected at all scales to the accuracy to which supersymmetry is preserved .",
    "on the other hand , since a realistic model will have soft susy breaking masses that violate susy explicitly in the lagrangian , the assumptions of the derivation of eqns([kar0],[kar ] ) will not hold and thus , at least till we have better control on the mechanisms of susy breaking in asguts , we should not trust these relations to an accuracy better than @xmath45 or perhaps @xmath49 .",
    "these equations thus impose strong restrictions and requirements on the pattern of condensates in the theory . in the presence of a tree superpotential",
    "we expect that gaugino condensation at a scale @xmath50 implies uv condensation of moduli ( and relations among different moduli vevs ) and vice versa at least as long as supersymmetry is unbroken . in the perturbative theory",
    "the moduli are defined as polynomials in the gauge variant chiral fields and their ( large ) vevs determine the broken symmetry of the low energy gauge theory while characterizing it in a gauge invariant way .",
    "a subtle but inescapable possibility in this regard is that of _ quantum _ phase transitions in which e.g the product of two higgs fields obtains an expectation value but _ not _ the fields themselves .",
    "this is a real possibility since the scale of perturbative unification @xmath1 is sufficiently close to the uv strong coupling scale @xmath51 to make quantum condensates important .",
    "however we shall resist the temptation of invoking such condensates , until and unless it is unavoidable , so as to retain maximal calculability in the effective gauge theory below the gut scale .",
    "the effective low energy field theory must thus be shown to be compatible with the these very novel quantum vevs of gauge singlet composite operators which preserve all the symmetries of the theory , by definition .",
    "our model consists of a n=1 susy su(2 ) gauge theory coupled to a su(2 ) * 5 * -plet ( @xmath52 spin @xmath53 ) chiral superfield presented as a symmetric traceless @xmath54 matrix : @xmath55 .",
    "the additional feature relative to the familiar adjoint representation is that such a complex symmetric matrix can not , in general , be diagonalized by a complex orthogonal transformation .",
    "however one observes that firstly the ( upper triangular ) jordan canonical form of @xmath56 is    @xmath57    so that @xmath58 are dependent on only two independent complex numbers @xmath59 and as such only two of them , say the quadratic and cubic invariants @xmath60 , need be considered independent .",
    "this can also be seen from the less familiar result that complex orthogonal transformation by @xmath61 can be used to put @xcite a complex symmetric matrix in a block diagonal canonical form :    @xmath62    where a diagonal block @xmath63 is either a @xmath64 submatrix consisting of an eigenvalue of @xmath65 or a @xmath66 symmetric submatrix of form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an eigenvalue and @xmath69 has all its eigenvalues zero , all its eigenvectors quasi - null and an eigenspace of dimension @xmath70 . the matrices @xmath69 arise because in general a complex symmetric matrix can have invariant eigen - subspaces of zero euclidean length .",
    "however in the present instance the additional freedom associated with these subspaces is irrelevant to definition of the gauge singlet moduli and also to the extremization of the superpotential w.r.t the field @xmath56 .",
    "the d - terms can be written as a commutator @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "after fixing the @xmath72 gauge freedom by putting @xmath56 in the canonical form ( [ canon ] ) one sees that the pseudo - moduli contained in @xmath69 must vanish so that one can work with the diagonal form .    the index of the * 5 * -plet ( in the normalization where the fundamental has index @xmath43 ) is @xmath73 .",
    "thus this theory has a one loop gauge beta function @xmath74 and hence its coupling grows in the ultraviolet . in the absence of a superpotential the underlying theory has @xmath75 symmetry under which the chiral superfield @xmath56 has charge 1 and in addition a @xmath76 r - symmetry under which the grassman coordinate @xmath77 has charge 1 , the gaugino -1 and the components @xmath78 of @xmath56 have charges ( 0,1,2 ) respectively .",
    "both these symmetries have mixed @xmath79 anomalies but the linear combination    @xmath80    generates a non anomalous u(1 ) r symmetry .",
    "the charges of the various chiral superfields and components ( and of the holomorphic parameters introduced below ) are given in table i.    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table 1 : * @xmath81 charges of fields and parameters .    the contributions of the elementary fermions to the @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( gravitational ) anomalies are @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "the fermionic components of the moduli fields i.e @xmath86 have @xmath83 charges 3,7 and hence precisely match these anomalies .",
    "the glueball field @xmath87 can not therefore be consistently included alone in the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the most general renormalizable tree superpotential is    @xmath88    prima facie this potential violates all the @xmath89 symmetries .",
    "however by considering@xcite the parameters @xmath90 as expectation values of chiral fields one can exploit the holomorphicity of the susy theories w.r.t chiral fields and hence we assign the charges shown in table i to @xmath91 and @xmath92 so as to formally preserve the @xmath89 symmetries .",
    "the one loop gauge coupling evolution in the range @xmath93 is    @xmath94    if the higgs field decouples completely and leaves an unbroken pure @xmath52 gauge theory below the scale @xmath91 the in the range @xmath95 the gauge coupling evolves as @xmath96    here @xmath51 is the scale where the ( one - loop ) running coupling of the as model diverges ( henceforth abbreviated to @xmath50 ) and @xmath97 the corresponding scale for the effective theory in which the higgs multiplet has decoupled completely without breaking the symmetry .",
    "it can also happen that the higgs multiplet breaks the symmetry partially : i.e in this case down to u(1 ) . in that case",
    "the low energy theory will be a pure @xmath89 gauge theory coupled to charged higgs remnants ( if any ) and the @xmath98 gauge coupling evolves accordingly and must be matched at the scale @xmath91 to the coupling in the high energy theory .",
    "however , in more complicated models with larger gauge groups , the low energy symmetry can be non - abelian .",
    "let @xmath99 be a notional low energy scale where the gauge coupling of the low energy effective theory is specified , then by matching gauge couplings of the uv and ir theories at the threshold @xmath91 ( in the dr scheme)@xcite one gets    @xmath100    it is important to note that the decoupling parameter @xmath101 must be taken to zero as @xmath102 while keeping @xmath97 constant for consistency .",
    "when building effective superpotentials invariant under all symmetries ( anomalous or not ) it is also useful to assign @xmath103 the charges 20,16,0 and use @xmath50 to adjust dimensions in dynamical expressions@xcite .",
    "proceeding in the familiar way @xcite one finds that the symmetries of the theory restrict the dynamical superpotential to the form    @xmath104    note that the exponent of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 is the index of the higgs , n=2 the gauge casimir ) is @xmath107 and thus has the form familiar from qcd but is positive due to a double negative ( numerator and denominator ) . as is well known , these exponents are determined by symmetry and dimensional analysis coupled with the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the unknown function @xmath108 is a power series    @xmath109    as in the case of qcd such a function can , presumably , arise via ( fractional ) instanton or other non - perturbative effects .",
    "our basic assumption and approximation is that @xmath24 is non zero and admits an expansion in the perturbing parameters @xmath110 .",
    "as we shall see , the presence of such a function , which respects all symmetries and anomalies , allows one to implement the demands of decoupling in a straightforward manner and presents no difficulties of the sort one might expect to encounter if it was forbidden for deep reasons . on the contrary , we show that the consistency of the physical picture requires a dynamical superpotential , or at least a constraint implementing condensation .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that even in the well studied case of susy qcd the amplitude of the induced superpotential is only reliably calculable@xcite , so far , in the case @xmath111 while the amplitudes in all cases where fractional powers of @xmath112 enter are deduced only on the basis of decoupling .",
    "note that if the function @xmath108 respects the form of the ( fractional ) instanton expansion then ( schematically )    @xmath113    where we have written the instanton suppression factor @xmath114 as @xmath115 using the one loop definition of @xmath50 .",
    "thus in eqn.([what ] ) @xmath116 . since we regard the superpotential parameters as small perturbations to the main dynamics we see that to leading order in @xmath117 we can write    @xmath118 \\label{w}\\ ] ]    where @xmath119 are dimensionless and we have dropped the constant term as irrelevant .",
    "our assumption is thus that , at least in the perturbative regime , the superpotential @xmath24 represents the main non - perturbative effects .",
    "its implications for the vacuum structure can be evaluated by extremizing it w.r.t the perturbative field @xmath56 .",
    "the same result may also be obtained by demanding @xcite that a superpotential dependent on @xmath120 and the glueball field @xmath32 reproduce the abj anomalies and be invariant under the @xmath121 symmetry . in that case one",
    "finds that    @xmath122 -8 s ln s\\ ] ]    satisfies all the conditions imposed even if @xmath123 is taken to be an arbitrary power series in its arguments .",
    "from such a superpotential one could , given h , eliminate @xmath120 using the vacuum equations of motion , to obtain a superpotential @xmath124 which can be used to characterize the gaugino condensate in the vacuum of the low energy pure gauge theory . in the process",
    "one finds , to leading order in @xmath110 the konishi anomaly relation eqn([kar ] ) .",
    "conversely , in the same approximation , if one eliminates the field @xmath32 in favour of @xmath120 one finds @xmath125 .",
    "the konishi relation eqn.([kar ] ) between gaugino ( @xmath32 ) and chiral multiplet ( @xmath120 ) condensates is then readily seen to follow from from the extremization of the total superpotential .",
    "the effects of the @xmath90 dependence of @xmath123 appear as corrections .",
    "recently remarkable claims have appeared @xcite regarding the calculability of the full ( @xmath90 ) corrections to @xmath126 and @xmath127 via large @xmath128 matrix models ( at least in theories where the chiral multiplets can be written as matrix representations of the gauge group ) .",
    "such results would permit evaluation of the chiral condensates and ( via a legendre transform ) construction of @xmath24 .",
    "moreover the konishi relation eqn([kar ] ) is a rigorous relation that should be obeyed to all orders in the parameters @xmath90 and this will also constrain @xmath123 . since we are here working only to leading order in @xmath90",
    "the form of our superpotential is already consistent with the konishi anomaly relation as explained .",
    "one gets    @xmath129    the @xmath130 refers to taking the scalar component and will be implicit hence forth .",
    "since the limit @xmath131 should be nonsingular for as theories , the behaviour of the unknown dynamical function @xmath132 as @xmath133 is constrained . if @xmath134 are the exponents of g in these limits then one obviously has @xmath135 since these represent the conditions required to approach @xmath136 at constant @xmath137 , and @xmath138 at constant @xmath139 , respectively , without @xmath24 becoming singular .",
    "the vanishing of the @xmath140 terms gives    @xmath141    where @xmath142    the solutions to these equations can be divided into    *",
    "a ) * singlet mode solutions which arise when @xmath143 .",
    "* b ) * perturbative mode solutions which arise when @xmath144 are both non zero .",
    "multiplying the two equations in @xmath145 using eqns.([wxwy ] ) we get    @xmath146    thus given @xmath132 one can determine @xmath147 , while the second of eqns([wxwy ] ) fixes @xmath139 once the value of @xmath148 is found :    @xmath149    we now perturb in the small parameter @xmath150 .",
    "three types of solutions can exist depending on the solution @xmath151 of the equation    @xmath152    these are    * @xmath151 non - zero and finite and determined by [ v0 ]    @xmath153    * @xmath154 * iii ) * @xmath155 .",
    "the exponents and amplitudes of perturbation in the small parameter @xmath156 are defined as :    @xmath157    when @xmath158 are non zero one finds @xmath159    continuing one can find the higher order corrections .",
    "thus @xmath160 and @xmath161 are determined in terms of @xmath151 and the derivatives of @xmath132 at @xmath151 .",

    "the construction of the possible form of the dynamical superpotential is now a very complex project since the number of chiral invariants even in the @xmath294 sector is very large .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves here to considering how the symmetry breaking in a successful model might proceed and the restrictions on the pattern of condensates discernable on the basis of the konishi anomaly .",

    "the latter alternative represents a regression to the pre - calculable or ad - hoc stage as far as the effective theory of interest is concerned .",
    "the price of the first illustrates the adage concerning free lunches !    to proceed further",
    "let us now add a single family of matter fields i.e include the two additional invariants @xmath308 .",
    "the ka equations are now @xmath309 whose solution is : @xmath310    while the argument concerning fine tuning still holds for the @xmath311 condensate relations we see that some new feature must intervene to avoid invoking `` quantum vacua '' if we are to avoid catastrophic violation of baryon and lepton number through vevs of the sfermions in the matter * 5,10 * ! although we can invoke the violation of supersymmetry and thus of the konishi anomaly relations ( [ kar ] ) by terms @xmath312 a further fine tuning to ensure that @xmath313 seems required .",
    "an even more rigorous fine tuning is required if one insists that each equation be modified only by terms @xmath314 since the @xmath315 vevs must vanish very strictly .",
    "a decision on the consistency of the former choice requires a review of the derivation of the konishi anomaly in the presence of soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the possibility that the vevs of the composite invariants involving matter superfields are non zero while the vevs of the fields themselves are not also deserves further consideration , particularly since it would contribute novel features to the effective theory ( analogous to instanton - chiral fermion vertices but now with chiral scalars disappearing into the vacuum in gauge and b - l invariant combinations ) .",
    "one can continue in this vein , adding the invariants @xmath316 containing @xmath317 , but we omit the details as the point regarding the necessity of fine tuning have already been made clear .",
    "although many details need to be worked out we see that so far the truly minimal(tm ) asgut program has not run into manifestly insuperable obstacles of interpretation or consistency and can even furnish a low energy effective theory largely identical to that of standard susy guts with , however , a radically modified picture of the root dynamics that engendered it and a way of generating the exponential gauge hierarchy of gut theories that is intrinsic to the rg running that suggested it s existence in the first place @xcite .",
    "since we are very far from verifying any feature of the standard susy gut dynamics at the unification scale it would be premature to foreclose the option of asymptotic strength . in the next section",
    "we shall see that asguts offer further novel insights into elementarity and a qualitatively new cosmogony .",
    "our new picture ( fig.1 ) of an elementary particle bears an intriguing duality to the picture of standard model particles as monopoles formed in the breaking of a dual unification group down to a dual standard model @xcite . in both pictures",
    "elementary particles have a core of very small size : @xmath318 in the dual unification picture and @xmath319 in the asgut picture .",
    "the monopole core of higgs / gauge magnetic energy is naturally dual to the tangle of electric flux that forms at the core of the elementary particle in the as theory with both representing concentrations of mass - energy of utterly tiny size .",
    "thus it is very natural to identify @xmath320 i.e @xmath321 .",
    "we argue below that asguts present ready answers to some of the difficulties faced by dual unification models when we make this identification of the dual unification scale @xmath322 not with the perturbative electric unification scale @xmath1 but with the uv condensation scale @xmath51 .",
    "monopole solutions of the classical equations of motion make sense only in the regimes where the gauge coupling @xmath323 is small",
    ". therefore the electric dual of the magnetic coupling @xmath324 will be large at the same energy scale i.e _ the electric theory should be as_. furthermore the discrepancy between the large mass one would expect for a weakly coupled monopole with a core of size @xmath325 and the gev scale masses of sm particles ( at the ew scale , or even -after renormalization - at the perturbative unification scale @xmath1 ) receives an elegant explanation in terms of the rapid growth of the effective mass of sm non singlet masses with the growth of the gauge coupling and the vanishing of their wave function renormalization constant as the confinement scale @xmath12 lying above @xmath326 is approached : the huge dual model soliton mass at @xmath322 can thus be identified with the large mass of the gauge variant particles as they approach confinement . correspondingly the dual model s monopole mass @xmath327 will fall as its coupling grows strongly below @xmath12 to match the rapidly falling electric coupling . in other words",
    "the dual identification @xmath328 is also naturally implied .",
    "this picture is also in accord with the large values of the magnetic coupling that may be expected on the basis of the known values of the couplings of the sm and the duality relation @xmath329 .",
    "these show that the dual gauge group may be expected to be confining at all energies below @xmath330 corresponding to confinement of its particles and of monopoles of standard guts and providing a clear reason for their non observation .",
    "_ this constitutes a novel and robust solution of the monopole problem@xcite of guts .",
    "_    finally , in the context of a supersymmetric as gut one enjoys the additional bonus of complete supermultiplets of dual monopoles dual to the chiral supermultiplets containing the fermions and sfermions of the mssm .",
    "this avoids the necessity of conferring a half integer spin on the bosonic monopoles by delicate additional mechanisms @xcite : both quarks and squarks arise together . since the dual model is af , these arguments motivate a supersymmetric dual unification scenario @xcite using e.g an af @xmath331 gauge theory with adjoint higgs broken to @xmath332 at a scale @xmath333 .    the high temperature behaviour of as theories and in particular asguts is also remarkable .",
    "one expects that the growing gauge coupling at high temperature will cause all the gauge variant fields to condense and their fluctuations will acquire infinite effective masses leaving behind only a few gauge singlet degrees of freedom associated with the d - flat chiral moduli , which typically have masses in the region of @xmath50 , to carry the entire energy content of the ( cosmological ) system .",
    "conversely _ cooling _ below @xmath51 liberates the gauge degrees of freedom and the gauge variant fermions and scalars !",
    "it is this pleasing cosmogony in which the `` featureless '' ( i.e sm singlet ) but ultra - energetic initial plasma freezes out into a manifold plurality that inspired the name _ pleromal _ @xcite .",
    "these considerations motivate a detailed study of the pleromal gauge singlet dynamics at high temperatures .",
    "this may be undertaken using standard susy sigma model techniques .",
    "the relation of asguts to gravitation is clearly of possible fundamental importance .",
    "we restrict ourselves to remarking here that the common feature of asymptotic strength of gravity and asguts , together with susy @xcite and the closeness @xmath334 is a plausible motivation for re - evaluating the program of induced@xcite ( super)@xcite - gravity in the context of a susy asgut with background metric and gravitino fields in the fundamental lagrangian introduced to permit the implementation of ( super ) general coordinate invariance . as is well known @xcite this scenario by passes the no - go theorems limiting the generation of massless particles with spin greater than @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "a large number of complex dynamical issues must be resolved before the viability of realistic asgut or as - technicolour scenarios can be established .",

    "<S> using a simple asymptotically strong n=1 susy su(2 ) gauge theory coupled to a * 5 * -plet chiral superfield we demonstrate the plausibility of the `` truly minimal '' asymptotically strong grand unification scenario proposed by us recently . assuming a dynamical superpotential consistent with the symmetries and anomalies is actually induced non - perturbatively we show the gauge symmetry is dynamically and spontaneously broken at a uv scale that is generically _ exponentially _ larger than the scales characteristic of the effective low energy theory . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern of condensates in a semi - realistic @xmath0 asgut is analyzed using the konishi anomaly assuming condensation occurs as shown by our toy model . </S>",
    "<S> the necessarily complementary relation of asguts to the dual unification program and the novel cosmogony implied by their unusual thermodynamic properties are also discussed .    </S>"
