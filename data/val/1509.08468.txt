    "as gas rich starburst galaxies and massive mergers , ultraluminous and luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirgs ) in the local universe provide valuable insight and context for phenomena that impact galaxy formation and evolution at high redshift .",
    "ulirgs , with total l@xmath1/l@xmath2 are overwhelmingly represented by systems in the latest stages of a merger between two gas - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "the strong infrared luminosity ( l@xmath1 ) in local lirgs is powered by star formation and in some cases agn , both driven by galaxy mergers and interactions .",
    "lirgs ( l@xmath1/l@xmath3 ) in the high redshift universe may commonly be mergers , as supported by observational evidence of disturbed morphologies in submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) and an increase in merger activity with redshift  @xcite . in the local universe , however ,",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath4 ) of lirgs show little or no evidence of ongoing or past strong interactions ( @xcite ,  howell et al . in prep ) . in order to fully understand the processes that govern star formation and black hole assembly a clear and complete picture of the evolution u / lirgs in the local universe is essential .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) furnishes one of the most powerful tools for the study of nearby u / lirgs . through its ability to both spatially and spectrally map a galaxy",
    ", it provides a wealth of spatially resolved information tracing the kinematics of the gas and stars , variations in the radiation field and sources of ionizing photons , metallicity and chemistry in the ism , maps of extinction and gas flows .",
    "ifs studies in recent years have enabled the discovery of extended shock excitation in several nearby galaxies , notably in u / lirgs and other massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite identified extended liner - like emission resulting from shocks in a small sample of ulirgs .",
    "@xcite found widespread shock - excitation in the extended emission associated with outflows in a study of several galactic wind - bearing galaxies .",
    "a larger ifs study found a significant fraction of tidally induced shock excitation in nearby lirgs @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered extended shocks caused by gas accreting on to a giant brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) . finally , @xcite found extended shock excitation caused by a galactic wind in the m82-like galaxy ngc 839 and widespread shocks in the late - stage lirg mergers ngc 3256 and ic 1623 @xcite . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "new slow shock models were employed to analyze the shocked gas . in all of the above cases , shock excitation exhibits characteristics of extended liner - like emission with broadened line profiles .",
    "the shock excitation seen in the lirgs ngc 839 , ngc 3256 and ic 1623 is associated with moderately broadened emission line profiles and enhanced emission line ratios of lower ionization species such as [ sii]@xmath5   and [ oi]@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the shocks themselves are due to major gas flows caused by the merger process . during a major merger",
    ", gas is driven inwards by tidal forces , which can result in shock excitation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this infalling gas fuels massive bursts of star formation and agn activity which in turn drive massive galactic outflows and further shocks into the ism and beyond . in an effort to determine the contribution from shocks in u / lirgs and the relationship between shocks and merger progress , we have searched for similar signatures in a larger ifs sample of 10 nearby u / lirgs @xcite .",
    "we find many of the galaxies in our sample , especially those in later - stage mergers , exhibit evidence of significant ongoing shock excitation in their optical spectra . to characterize the relative contribution from shocks throughout the merger process , we extend and expand upon the analyzes from our previous work in @xcite with a sample of u / lirgs covering the entire merger sequence .",
    "this paper presents a comprehensive study of the emission line properties of the wide field spectrograph ( wifes ) great observatory all - sky lirg survey ( goals ) sample ( wigs ) , with an emphasis on understanding the shock emission observed . the sample",
    ", observations and analysis are described in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the emission line ratio maps and diagnostic diagrams for the sample are discussed in section 4 .",
    "a summary of the velocity dispersion distributions for the wifes goals sample is given in section 5 .",
    "section 6 summarizes the various diagnostics as a function of merger stage . the total contribution from shocks as a function of merger stage , the potential impact of shock excited gas on observational interpretation , and the potential overlap with agn / composite galaxies is discussed in section 7 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "we use the cosmological parameters assumed in the summary of the goals sample  @xcite , based on the five - year wmap results @xcite : h@xmath7=70  km  s@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9=0.72 , and @xmath10=0.28 .",
    "our targets are u / lirgs drawn from the great observatory all - sky lirg survey ( goals ) sample @xcite .",
    "goals is a multi - wavelength survey of the brightest 60@xmath11 m extragalactic sources in the local universe ( @xmath12 ) with redshifts z @xmath13 0.088 .",
    "goals is a complete subset of the iras revised bright galaxy sample ( rbgs ) @xcite .",
    "objects in goals cover the full range of nuclear spectral types and interaction stages and may serve as useful analogs for comparison with high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the goals u / lirgs represent an entire array of merger stages from isolated starburst systems to massive post - mergers as well as galaxies in compact groups .",
    "the goals systems include starburst galaxies , agn , composite systems , liners and e+a galaxies .",
    "while the ulirgs in goals are composed entirely of major mergers , the lower luminosity lirgs represent a variety of systems - some past or future ulirgs , others simply undergoing intense bursts of star formation driving up the infrared luminosity temporarily @xcite .",
    "our sample consists of targets observable from the south .",
    "our observations were conducted with the wide field field spectrograph at the mount stromlo and siding spring observatory 2.3 m telescope .",
    "wifes is a , dual beam , image - slicing integral field unit ( ifu ) described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have previously presented analysis of smaller portions of the wifes goals dataset in @xcite . in short , a single pointing from our dataset provides a data cube @xmath14 , sampled with @xmath15 spaxels in double binning mode .",
    "the typical seeing was @xmath16 .",
    "the setup used for our observations produces a spectral coverage of 3700 - 5700   for the blue spectra , at a spectral resolution of r@xmath17 ( @xmath18 km s@xmath8 ) and 5700 - 7000   for the red spectra at a resolution of r@xmath19 ( @xmath20 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "thus , the data have sufficient spectral resolution in the red to allow detailed dynamical studies , while the total wavelength coverage ( 3700 - 7000  ) is sufficient to support excitation and chemical abundance analyzes .",
    "the data were taken over 5 separate observing runs in july , august and september 2009 and march and may 2010 .",
    "observations were begun shortly after the instrument was commissioned , prior to the availability of nod - and - shuffle mode .",
    "hence data taken in 2009 are taken primarily in classical observing mode with separate observations of the sky throughout each evening , while observations carried out in 2010 primarily use nod - and - shuffle mode for sky subtraction .",
    "table a.1 lists the systems and dates observed , with the number of individual wifes pointings and total exposure times for each pointing , divided among two to five exposures .",
    "figure a1 shows our wifes pointings overlaid on digitized sky survey ( dss ) images for each system listed in table a.1 .",
    "we observe a total of 27 goals systems with a wide variety of properties described in section 2.3 .",
    "observations were generally aligned and/or mosaiced to cover the entire galaxy or galaxies in each system .",
    "the data were reduced and flux calibrated using the wifes pipeline , briefly described in @xcite , which uses iraf routines adapted primarily from the gemini nifs data reduction package .",
    "cosmic ray removal was performed on the raw data frames prior to reduction with the `` dcr '' routine @xcite .",
    "the bias subtraction is somewhat complicated by the use of quad - readout with four amplifiers on each ccd to decrease chip read - out time .",
    "additionally , there is a slight slope and instability in the bias across each region of the chip .",
    "bias frames are taken immediately before and after each set of observations and a 2-d fit of the surface is subtracted from the temporally nearest object data in order to avoid adding additional noise to the data .",
    "any resulting residual is accounted for with a fit to unexposed regions of the detector .",
    "quartz lamp flats are used to account for the response curve of the chip and twilight sky flats are used to correct for illumination variation along each of the slitlets .",
    "spatial calibration is carried out by placing a thin wire in the filter wheel and illuminating the slitlet array with a continuum lamp .",
    "this procedure defines the center of each slitlet .",
    "the individual spectra have no spatial distortion because the camera corrects the small amount of distortion introduced by the spectrograph .",
    "thus only low - order spatial mapping of the slitlets is required .",
    "wavelength calibration is performed using cuar and near arc lamp observations to provide sufficient lines in both the blue and red arms of the camera .",
    "arc lamp data were taken in between sets of object exposures .",
    "each of the 25 slitlets is then rectified by the pipeline into a full data cube ( one for each camera ) sampled on a common wavelength scale .",
    "telluric absorption features were removed from the resulting red data cubes using observations of b - stars or featureless white dwarfs ( typically also used as flux standards ) taken at similar air mass .",
    "the effects of differential atmospheric refraction are calculated and corrected by the pipeline for the blue data cubes .",
    "flux calibration of each individual data cube was carried out using flux standards observed throughout each night .",
    "standard stars are taken from the wifes observing manual @xcite .",
    "individual data cubes were flux calibrated using the standards observed nearest in time and air mass .",
    "the individual data cubes are binned by 2 pixels in the spatial direction to increase signal to noise and produce square spatial pixels ( spaxels ) 1x 1 .",
    "observations taken in march 2009 were binned during the data reduction process , observations taken in may 2009 and later were binned on - chip .",
    "typical seeing achieved at sso during our observations is @xmath21 , with some variation , on par with the spaxel size for our data cubes .",
    "individual data cubes thus consist of 25x38 1square spaxels , producing over 900 spectra . in practice ,",
    "a few rows of spaxels are trimmed from the top and bottom of the individual cubes , corresponding to the edges of the slitlets .",
    "finally , the individual reduced , flux - calibrated data cubes are median combined and sampled to a common spatial grid using overlapping features found in each pointing .",
    "this is done for both single pointing and for mosaiced observations .",
    "combined data cubes were aligned astrometrically by comparing a pseudo ` r - band ' image generated using the red spectrum from each spaxel with either dss r - band or hst data when available .      in all , 27 systems comprising nearly 40 individual galaxies were observed .",
    "the sample was selected to cover a range of infrared luminosities , merger stages and nuclear activity .",
    "basic sample properties are shown in table 1 .",
    "the final sample comprises 4 ulirgs and 23 lirgs .",
    "this represents a slightly larger fraction of ulirgs than the goals sample itself , which has 23 ulirgs and 198 lirgs .",
    "we apply the merger stage classification used in @xcite , adopted from @xcite .",
    "isolated systems ( `` iso '' ) have no neighbors within a projected distance of 100 kpc , wide pairs ( `` a '' ) are separated by a distance of greater than 10 kpc , close pairs ( `` b '' ) are separated by less than 10 kpc and latest - stage , coalesced mergers are a combination of the original diffuse , compact and old merger class ( `` cde'')-defined by an increase in compactness in k - band and decreasing to no evidence of any tidal features .",
    "this somewhat coarse sampling of the merger process is necessary given the small number in each class : two isolated systems , five wide pairs , ten close pairs and nine late - stage mergers .",
    "none the less , we are still able to trace bulk changes in the properties of our sample as a function of merger stage",
    ". individual notes about each system are provided in the appendix .    to avoid contamination by agn ionization in our analysis of shocks , four galaxies with strong optical , mid - ir and x - ray agn signatures",
    "are removed from the various merger stage bins and treated separately .",
    "the isolated galaxy iras f21453 - 3511 , the closely interacting pair iras f23128 - 5919 and the coalesced mergers iras 13120 - 5453 & f16164 - 0746 are all dominated by an agn , as detected via [ ne v ] in mid - ir spitzer spectroscopy @xcite and x - ray color / spectroscopy from chandra observations @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are not included in their respective merger classes for the analysis of shocks for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the possibility of lower - level agn activity in other systems is further discussed in section 7.3 .",
    "once the agn are removed , there are three isolated galaxies ( `` iso '' ) , four close pairs ( `` a '' ) , nine close pairs ( `` b '' ) and seven coalesced systems ( `` cde '' ) .",
    "the average log(l@xmath22 for the four classes are @xmath23 respectively , and @xmath24 for the four agn .",
    "the key data products required for our work are accurate emission line fluxes and emission line kinematics at the highest possible spatial resolution , with as few confounding spectroscopic fitting parameters as possible . in order to tailor the final data product derived from the cubes to the needs of the analysis , in - house idl routines combined with existing idl software",
    "were used to analyze the spectra from each final data cube .",

    "the wifes uhspecfit package cycles through the red and blue cubes for a single object , fitting the blue and red spectra from a given spaxel simultaneously . for each spectrum",
    ", the package performs an initial fit to the continuum and emission lines , checks whether any emission is found in the strongest lines ( h@xmath0and [ nii ] ) and if so performs a second , final fit using the first fit as input estimators . after fitting every spectrum in the data cube in this fashion ,",
    "the final data product is a data structure with spectral fits as well as all of the parameters necessary to reconstruct the emission line component fits for each line of each spectrum , as well as the errors on those parameters .",
    "the details of the fitting routine are further described in the following subsections .",
    "the first step in fitting a spectrum in all cases was to fit and subtract a stellar continuum using stellar population synthesis models from @xcite .",
    "this is done in order to obtain a pure emission line spectrum while accounting more accurately for stellar features that underlie the emission lines in several systems .",
    "an idl routine , ibackfit @xcite , fits a linear combination of stellar templates to the stellar continuua .",
    "ibackfit employs a least - squares analysis using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm via mpfit @xcite .",
    "ibackfit was applied in each case only to the blue spectrum , which holds the majority of the stellar spectral features in the wifes data .",
    "the best - fitting combination of templates was then combined with a functional fit and extrapolated to the entire data cube .",
    "no information from stellar template fitting ( i.e. stellar population age , metallicity , etc . ) was derived for the work in this paper .",
    "the continuum - subtracted spectrum is then fit with several gaussian emission lines using routines built using the mpfit package .",
    "the list of emission lines is chosen by the user prior to running uhspecfit .",
    "the emission lines fit in the wifes goals data include [ oii ]  3727,3729 , h@xmath26 , h@xmath27 , h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , [ oiii ]  4959,5007 , [ oi ]  6300,6364 , [ nii ]  6548,6583 , h@xmath30 and [ sii ]  6717,6731 .",
    "the [ oii ]   and [ sii ]   doublet flux ratios were allowed to vary within the upper and lower theoretical limits and the flux ratios of the [ oiii ] , [ oi ]  and [ nii ]  doublets were fixed to their prescribed theoretical values ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "emission line gaussian peaks are constrained to be greater than or equal to zero .",
    "one , two or three gaussian components are fit to every emission line , to account for the complex line profiles seen in several of the wifes goals systems .",
    "prior to running uhspecfit on a galaxy , mpfit was used to fit one , two and three gaussian components to the [ nii]+h@xmath0lines .",
    "an example of this process is given in figure 1 .",
    "each resulting one , two and three gaussian component fit was checked by eye . upon inspection , the best fit was chosen based on both quantitative comparison of the respective @xmath31 as well as a qualitative assessment of the goodness of fit and consistency with features in surrounding fits within a single galaxy , similar to the method employed by @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath31 does not markedly improve when an extra gaussian component is added , fewer components are used to avoid over - fitting the emission lines .",
    "consideration is also given to emission line fits in neighboring spaxels within a single cube when choosing whether to add additional gaussian components .",
    "the best fit emission line widths and redshifts are then passed to uhspecfit , which holds them fixed while simultaneously varying the remaining parameters .",
    "the resulting emission line fits to the rest of the spectrum were then again inspected by eye to ensure poorly and erroneously fit lines are rejected .",
    "this method resulted in more reliable , consistent fits with uhspecfit .",
    "all emission lines are fit simultaneously , but the redshift and velocity width of each gaussian component are fixed to be the same value for every emission line .",
    "the relative velocities are fixed separately for the red and blue data cubes to allow for variation in wavelength calibration and resolution between the red and the blue spectra .",
    "this assumption implies that the line - emitting gas in a single spaxel is produced in the same region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of a successful multi - component emission line fit to key diagnostic lines in a single spectrum .    the errors in the parameters used in fitting the emission lines are calculated by the fitting code , which includes propagation of the variance spectra .",
    "the parameters include the gaussian widths ( velocity dispersions ) ratio of dispersions between the blue and red spectra , individual gaussian peaks , redshift and any slight deviation between the blue and red wavelength calibrations .",
    "once a galaxy has been run through uhspecfit , we generate maps of the recessional velocity , velocity dispersion and emission line fluxes of each emission line component as well as maps of the total emission line flux of several strong lines .",
    "in addition to manual inspection of the emission line fits , a final s / n of 5 is used as a cutoff to create the total flux maps and a s / n of 3 cutoff as measured between component peaks and continuum noise is applied to the individual component maps . in all , @xmath32 spectra are analyzed in this paper , with @xmath33 individual gaussian components above the s / n cutoff .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath34 individual gaussian components in the `` iso '' galaxies , @xmath35 in `` a '' , @xmath36 in `` b '' , @xmath37 in `` cde '' and @xmath38 in the agn .",
    "the lower number of gaussian components in the cde bin despite the higher number of galaxies reflects both the small spatial extent of the emission line gas and the higher average distance to the coalesced merger galaxies .",
    "our emission line maps and diagrams provide an overview of the distribution of spaxels spaxels dominated by enhanced low ionization species emission as well as some indication of the underlying power source and metallicity . for our purposes ,",
    "the maps and diagnostic diagrams are most useful in spatially separating regions dominated by hii - region emission , shock emission and agn emission .",
    "the observed emission line ratios are governed by the overall flux of ionizing photons , the hardness of the radiation field and the metallicity of the gas . by taking emission - line ratios that are sensitive to abundance and with a variety of ionization potentials ,",
    "the source of ionizing radiation can be determined ( e.g. @xcite ) . with a harder radiation field",
    "than young stars or radiative shocks , agn - ionized gas has generally higher log([oiii]/h@xmath39 ) emission line ratios than hii - region and shock emission , with log([oiii]/h@xmath39 ) of order unity to a factor of several times unity .",
    "hii - regions exhibit a range of emission line ratios , with low ionization species - to - h@xmath0ratios ( log([nii]/h@xmath0)<-0.4 , log([sii]/h@xmath0)<-0.3 and log([oi]/h@xmath0)<-1.0 ) .",
    "hii - regions show a large range of log([oiii]/h@xmath39 ) emission line ratios ( log([oiii]/h@xmath39from -1.0 to 0.8 from high to low abundance respectively ) as a result of less efficient cooling leading to higher ionization parameters and thus higher [ oiii]/h@xmath39 .",
    "shocks with velocities of @xmath40 km  s@xmath8 , on the other hand correspond to enhancements in lower ionization lines ( [ nii ] , [ sii ] , [ oi ] ) , and some enhancement in [ oiii]/h@xmath39 in higher metallicity systems @xcite .",
    "both the distribution of line ratios and the values of the line ratios themselves provide useful information about the source(s ) of ionizing radiation in a galaxy .",
    "emission line ratio maps are generated using the total line fluxes spaxel by spaxel , which effectively traces the dominant power source .",
    "line ratio diagnostic diagrams provide a more detailed perspective of the sources of ionizing radiation at work in a given system @xcite . when combined with the spatial information from the line ratio maps , a clear picture of one or more power sources present in a galaxy",
    "is revealed .",
    "figure 3 shows how the diagrams and line ratios maps appear for three systems with very different sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "some of the galaxies in our sample appear to be dominated entirely by hii region emission , with no indication of any other source of ionizing radiation .",
    "iras f17222 - 5953 is a good example of such a system , as seen in figure 3 .",
    "the line ratios fall entirely within the hii - region portion of the diagnostic diagram .",
    "the [ oiii]/h@xmath39and [ nii]/h@xmath0ratios fall as a function of radius due to the presence of a metallicity gradient @xcite .",
    "the gradient and line ratios are entirely consistent with other star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "some of the galaxies in our parent sample exhibit a blend of strong agn activity blended with star formation .",
    "iras f21453 - 3511 , shown in fig .",
    "3 , is a good example of this behavior .",
    "the diagnostic diagrams in these galaxies have very strong [ oiii]/h@xmath39 , moving into the seyfert / agn portion of the diagnostic diagram .",
    "line ratio maps tend to show the highets emission line ratios in the nucleus , corresponding to the agn , decreasing with distance from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "finally , some galaxies show evidence of star formation blended with composite / liner - like emission .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 with the close pair iras f01053 - 3511 , which shows extended liner - like emission well outside the nuclear regions , which are dominated primarily by star formation . extended composite / liner emission alone , however , does not confirm the presence of shocks @xcite .",
    "extended low - ionization emission regions ( liers ) can be caused by a number of mechanisms , including heating by post - agb stars @xcite and diffuse ionized emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "example emission line ratio maps are shown in figure 3 , with the remaining galaxy emission - line maps given in the appendix .",
    "emission line ratio maps are generated using the total line fluxes spaxel by spaxel , which effectively traces the dominant power source .",
    "for instance , in figure 3 large portions of the merging system iras f01053 - 1746 are dominated by emission line ratios consistent with star formation while there is evidence of enhanced emission line ratios in areas of lower h@xmath0surface brightness ( as traced by the contours ) .",
    "as is noted in  @xcite , even in some portions of iras f01053 - 1746 dominated by hii  region emission there may be a contribution to the emission from shocks that can be separated kinematically , but the total flux will show hii  region - like line ratios overall",
    ".    systems dominated entirely by hii  region emission include iras f13373 + 0105 w & e , iras f17222 - 5953 , iras f16443 - 2915 n & s. these systems exhibit line ratios consistent with hii  region emission ( see also section 4.2 ) across the entire line ratio map , with no indication of any other significant source of ionizing flux .    in some systems",
    "the line ratio map provides an immediate indication that there may be an agn present . in systems with a strong agn ,",
    "the nuclear regions tend to be dominated by strong line ratios in every map , including [ oiii]/h@xmath39 . we are able to resolve and separate regions of star formation and agn ionization in the maps of iras f21453 - 3511 and iras f23128 - 5919 , both of which show a combination of seyfert ii nuclei and ongoing star formation @xcite .    in many of the emission line maps ,",
    "galaxies show enhanced low - ionization line ratios away from the nucleus and in inter - galaxy regions with hii - region like line ratios in the nuclear regions : this radial rise in line ratios is opposite to the drop in line ratios seen in agn - dominated systems .",
    "as shown in @xcite , underlying shock excitation combined with a lower contribution from star formation with increasing radius reveals itself as stronger low - ionization line ratios away from the nucleus .",
    "some examples include iras f12043 - 3140 , iras f15107 + 0724 , iras f17138 - 1017 , iras f20551 - 4250 and iras f21330 - 384 in some cases this may be enhanced by galactic winds @xcite , as in iras f02072 - 1025 and irasf f10257 - 4339 @xcite .",
    "dust lanes also serve to bury ongoing star formation , enhancing shock - like line ratios , shock - like ratios . especially where shocks are caused by outflowing gas , the passage of dense clouds of gas through a substrate of more diffuse ism , or through cloud - cloud collisions .",

    "line ratio diagnostic diagrams provide a more detailed perspective of the sources of ionizing radiation at work in a given system @xcite . when combined with the spatial information from the line ratio maps , a clearer picture of the combined power sources",

    "the diagrams for the remaining 30 data cubes , including diagrams with individual line components rather than total flux , are shown in the appendix .",
    "traditionally , emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams have been applied to nuclear spectra of u / lirgs to investigate the presence of agn ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "systems with resolved agn activity provide a good example of the power of ifs . iras f21453 - 3511",

    "the rest of the spaxels form a sequence stretching towards the hii  region portion of the diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios decrease away from the nucleus .",
    "the combination of line ratio maps and diagnostic diagrams provides a way to disambiguate the difference between agn enhanced emission and shock enhanced line ratios .",
    "@xcite discuss in detail this method for the systems iras f02072 - 1025 , f01053 - 1746 , f10257 - 4339 but the same effect can be seen in , for example , iras f12043 - 3140 and iras f21330 - 3846 .",
    "the latter two systems show a sequence of spaxels in the line diagnostic diagrams indicating enhanced line ratios consistent with some contribution from non - hii region emission .",
    "the enhanced line ratios in the emission line maps of these systems are not consistent with agn but with shock excitation due to the merger process .",
    "as described in @xcite , the presence of slow shocks leads to liner - like line ratios in the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the [ sii]/h@xmath0and [ oi]/h@xmath0ratios in particular are enhanced in the presence of shocks due to their low ionization potential , as is seen in great detail in iras f01053 - 1746 and f10257 - 4339 @xcite .",
    "liner - like line ratios are seen in extranuclear regions in some other systems as well ( e.g. iras f20551 - 4250 ) .",
    "two of our systems , iras f13373 + 0105 and f18341 - 5732 exhibit evidence of nuclear liner activity , which are more likely associated with the traditional low - luminosity agn explanation for liner emission , whether it be photo - excited @xcite or shock excited @xcite .",
    "the underlying metallicity of the gas also affects the line ratios seen in the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "iras f17222 - 5953 and 13373 + 0105 w are good examples of this effect : both galaxies have an intrinsic metallicity gradient which create the sequence of values seen in the [ nii]/h@xmath0diagrams @xcite .",
    "most of the galaxies that show hii  region emission have spaxels that correspond to intrinsically high metallicity gas , with the exceptions being iras f01053 - 1746 and f18093 - 5744 c&n .",
    "velocity dispersion provides a separate , independent test for the presence of shock emission @xcite . here",
    "we examine the velocity dispersions of the emission line gaussian components .",
    "velocity dispersions associated with hii  regions are typically a few tens of , while low - velocity shocks and agn line profiles can have velocity dispersions in excess of 100  @xcite . in their discussions of the high velocity dispersions in the sins sample ,",
    "@xcite note that the turbulent star formation , shocks and stellar feedback can drive up velocity dispersion as well @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the correlation between average velocity dispersion and star formation surface density seen in , for instance , the sample of @xcite .",
    "we analyze the distribution of velocity dispersions fit to the individual components in each system .",
    "an example histogram of velocity dispersions is shown in figure 4 , with the remaining systems shown in the appendix .",
    "the dispersion distribution is shown as both the fraction of the total number of profiles at a given @xmath41 and as a fraction of the total f@xmath42 in a given velocity bin .",
    "all gaussian components detected in at least one emission line are included in the velocity dispersion distribution histograms .    in systems mainly dominated by star formation ( e.g. iras f16443 - 2915 n / s , f17222 - 5953 )",
    "the majority of the velocity dispersions are consistent with the expected @xmath41 of a few tens of .",
    "as noted in @xcite , galaxies with a significant contribution from shocks show a significant contribution between  @xmath41=100 - 200 , consistent with the shock velocities derived from line ratios ( e.g. iras f01053 - 1746 , f02072 - 1025 , f10257 - 4339 , @xcite ) .",
    "many galaxies also exhibit a significant number of components with @xmath41 between 40 - 90 , likely consistent with disc turbulence .",
    "the galaxies in our sample that show unambiguous agn signatures also show some contribution at significantly higher velocity dispersions , of 300 - 600 .      in their lower spectral resolution ifs survey of u / lirgs , @xcite established a correlation between velocity dispersion and emission line ratio , which they attributed to shocked gas components .",
    "in @xcite we see the same correlation for iras f01053 - 1746 and f10257 - 4339 , consistent with the other signatures of shock excitation @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the galaxies in the wifes goals sample which have line profiles fit with elevated velocity dispersion components reproduce this enhancement in [ nii]/h@xmath0 , [ sii]/h@xmath0  and [ oi]/h@xmath0  with respect to velocity dispersion , regardless of the excitation mechanism . the exceptions to this rule appear to be iras f18093 - 5744 c & s. iras f18093 - 5744 c in particular shows the opposite trend : a component with elevated velocity dispersion and correspondingly lower [ nii]/h@xmath0 , [ sii]/h@xmath0  and [ oi]/h@xmath0  ratios .",
    "iras f18093 - 5744 c is a compact wolf - rayet galaxy with the emission driven by young , bright stars @xcite .",
    "our data show two narrow components with an underlying broad component seen in the @xmath41 vs. ratio diagrams .",
    "this broader component is elevated in [ oiii]/h@xmath39 , and can be seen in the diagnostic diagram in the appendix , corresponding to lower metallicity gas , consistent with the analysis in @xcite .",
    "all line diagnostic methods described in section 5 have been applied to each galaxy in our sample .",
    "we now track how they change , if at all , as a function of merger evolution . we group spaxels from galaxies in each of the four merger stages as outlined in section 2 .",
    "the four positively identified agn are placed in a separate group .",
    "we now examine the overall shape of the line ratio diagnostic diagrams , velocity dispersion distribution and @xmath41 vs. line ratio diagrams for each merger stage .",
    "figure 5 shows the three diagnostic diagrams for each merger group and the agn .",
    "the points are generated using the total flux line ratios in each spaxel for every galaxy in a given merger class . in the case of the close pair stage ,",
    "the data points are somewhat dominated by iras f01053 - 1746 & f10257 - 4339 , but the other individual galaxies in this merger stage group have line ratios that fall in consistent regions of the diagnostic diagram .",
    "the agn stage is likewise dominated by iras f21453 - 3511 and f23128 - 5919 which have comparatively spaxels in their diagnostic diagrams , though the relatively fewer points from the other two agn are again consistent .",
    "the overall shape of the diagnostic diagrams shows an increasing number of spaxels in the composite region of the [ nii]/h@xmath0line ratio diagnostic diagram in later merger stages .",
    "this result is consistent with the work of @xcite which shows an increasing fraction of composite behavior with merger stage .",
    "there is a much narrower range of spaxels in the hii  region portion of the [ nii]/h@xmath0diagram for the `` cde '' galaxies , which is primarily a result of the flattening and dilution of metallicity gradients as mergers progress : we discuss this effect further in @xcite .",
    "the same effect is seen in individual systems in the `` b '' stage .      as in the case of line ratio evolution with merger stage",
    ", there is also clear evidence of an corresponding evolution in the observed velocity dispersion . in figure 7 , we show the change in the overall velocity dispersion distribution as a function of merger stage .",
    "the isolated systems are dominated primarily by narrow hii  region - like velocity dispersions , though there is a tail of higher dispersion spaxels corresponding to some turbulence and the liner emission in iras f18341 - 3413 . in the widely separated pairs",
    "the peak in both number of profiles and total h@xmath0flux shifts slightly to the right and the tail of broader spaxels grows , indicating an increase in turbulent star formation .",
    "figure 7 compares the velocity dispersion distribution for the isolated , `` cde '' and agn systems .",
    "the agn galaxies show a stronger high-@xmath41 component above 350 km / s that is not seen in the other distributions .    in the closely interacting pairs ,",
    "the shape of the dispersion distribution begins to change significantly : a strong tail of higher @xmath41 line profiles is seen in both fractional number and total f@xmath43 .",
    "this is consistent with the increase in outflows as the merger progresses , as seen in previous ifu studies ( @xcite ) , and in section 5 above . at the latest merger stages ,",
    "the velocity dispersion distribution is fairly flat from narrow to broad line components , indicating a significantly increased contribution from turbulent star formation and shocks in the emission line gas .",
    "figure 8 shows the evolution of the line ratio versus @xmath41 with merger stage .",
    "the overall shape of the diagrams tells the same story as the diagnostic diagrams and velocity dispersion distributions taken together : there is an overall trend in the total number of spaxels with enhanced velocity dispersion and emission line ratio as a function of merger stage .",
    "the agn show a bimodal distribution in the line ratio vs. @xmath41 , owing mainly to the difference in line ratio values at high velocity dispersion between iras f21453 - 3511 and f23128 - 5919 which dominate these figures .",
    "this is likely due to a difference in metallicity between the agn - illuminated gas in the two systems .",
    "in the absence of an agn , a relative increase in the velocity dispersion and shift of the strong emission line ratios in the diagnostic diagram towards the liner region is indicative of gas excited by slow shocks @xcite .",
    "moreover , high-@xmath41 and liner - like line components are not restricted to the nuclear regions of our non - agn systems , again consistent with widespread shock excitation caused by merger - driven gas flows as the source of ionization for the observed emission ( @xcite , see also individual system notes in appendix ) .",
    "we therefore interpret the overall relative increase in velocity dispersion , particularly in the absence of any detectable influence from an agn , as an increased relative contribution from slow shock excitation in our sample and discuss the relative strengths of each velocity component in our sample .      with the simple correlations established in the previous sections , @xmath41 can be used as a proxy for the total contribution from hii  region emission , turbulent star formation and shocks .",
    "the histograms of the distribution of @xmath41 discussed in section 5 and shown in figures 6 and 7 allow us to establish approximate cutoffs between the three components . for the discussion here",
    "we establish an upper limit of @xmath41=50  for pure hii  region emission and @xmath4490  for spaxels that are primarily dominated by shock excitation in the absence of an agn .",
    "figure 9 shows the change in the total fraction of f@xmath42 in each component as a function of merger stage .",
    "the fraction in each component is the total of the profiles in each merger stage bin .",
    "there is a minimal flux - weighted contribution of a few percent from a higher @xmath41 , shock - dominated component in the three isolated galaxies and in the widely separated pairs in our sample .",
    "the turbulent , mid - range @xmath41 component increases as the galaxies begin to interact , but stays roughly flat throughout the merger process .",
    "most interestingly , however , is the rapid increase in a high-@xmath41 component from wide to close pairs and from close pairs to late - stage mergers . by the `` cde '' stage , just over half of the total f@xmath42 we measure",
    "lies in high velocity dispersion line emission .",
    "the low-@xmath41 component is consistent with the velocity dispersions seen in star forming regions , while the mid-@xmath41 component is likely associated with regions of more turbulent star formation seen in strongly star bursting systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the highest observed velocity dispersions , above 90 , are caused by even more turbulent activity in the ism of u / lirgs .",
    "the most likely culprit is shocks caused by merger - driven gas flows , such as galactic winds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these lower velocity shocks exhibit velocity dispersions consistent with the outflow velocity and the observed high-@xmath41 gas , on the order of 100 - 200@xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath41 component observed in our systems is also correlated with elevated emission line ratios , as seen by @xcite and consistent with the radiative spectra of gas ionized by shocks .",
    "this combined elevation in emission line ratios and velocity dispersions increases as a function of merger stage , and in the 7 latest merger - stage systems , there appears to be a significant contribution to the optical spectra from merger - induced shocks .",
    "there is the possibility of contribution from a less luminous agn ( classical liner ) , which can similarly increase observed emission line ratios and velocity dispersions .",
    "the spatial and spectrally resolved information provided by our ifs observations , however , show not only elevated @xmath41 and line ratios in the nuclear regions , but at many kpc from the nucleus , more consistent with widespread shocks ( see appendix c ) .",
    "we discuss further possible contamination from agn in section 7.2 .",
    "the conclusion that the composite spectra we observe are due to shocks assumes that there is no appreciable contribution to the optical spectra from an agn .",
    "although we have excluded the four agn - dominated galaxies from our merger stage discussion , there remains the question of any low - level agn contribution to the optical spectra in some of our systems .",
    "this is of somewhat more of a concern in the latest - stage mergers in our sample , as the optical emission is concentrated primarily in the nuclear regions .",
    "although none of the galaxies in the merger sample have detectable [ ne v ] emission in the mid - ir , this does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a lower - luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "further , not all of the galaxies in our sample have been observed with chandra , and some systems that have been observed with chandra but show x - ray emission consistent with intense star formation may still harbor compton - thick agn @xcite .",
    "another measure of agn activity that can be derived from the mid - ir data is 6.2@xmath11 m  pah equivalent width ( eqw ) . in agn",
    "dominated spectra the hot dust continuum depresses the 6.2@xmath11 m  eqw and the pahs that generate the feature are apparently destroyed in the euv photon field @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined 6.2@xmath11 m  pah eqw values from nuclear spectra for the entire goals sample , setting a value eqw@xmath45@xmath11 m  for galaxies that are dominated by starburst and eqw@xmath46 for galaxies dominated by an agn .",
    "galaxies with eqw values that fall between these values are considered composite systems .    to make a more conservative estimate of the shock fraction in the late stage mergers galaxies with 6.2@xmath11 m  pah eqw @xmath47@xmath11 m",
    "are removed from the `` cde '' bin ( these include iras 08355 - 4944 , f10038 - 3338 , f17207 - 0014 and f20551 - 4250 , with 6.2@xmath11 m  pah eqw of 0.19 , 0.03 , 0.31 and 0.10@xmath11 m  ) .",
    "this leaves 3 coalesced mergers , iras f12592 + 0436 , f17138 - 1017 and f22467 - 4906 which have eqw of 0.55 , 0.68 and 0.45@xmath11 m  respectively .",
    "the total number of components with h@xmath0above the s / n cutoff in these three galaxies is @xmath48 .",
    "the new velocity dispersion distribution and shock fraction are shown in figures 11 and 12 .",
    "interestingly , when the potential low - luminosity agn bearing galaxies are excluded the fraction of emission from broad , slow - shock dominated velocity dispersion components goes up , moving from roughly 55% to nearly 70% of the observed h@xmath0flux . in fig .",
    "10 iras f17138 - 1017 is classified as a composite system , while f12592 + 0436 and f22467 - 4906 host extended liner - like emission , though in the complete absence of any indication of agn activity these three systems are clear examples of shock - driven lier hosts , with lier emission contaminating and in some cases dominating the observable optical emission line gas .",
    "our results indicate an overall increase in the total contribution from shocks to the global optical spectra of middle and late stage merging u / lirgs .",
    "the u / lirgs in the wifes goals sample contain buried star formation that is so extinguished as to be unobservable at optical wavelengths , which may account in part of the relative increase from non - hii region emission to the total observed emission line flux .",
    "a prime example of this is iras f01053 - 1746 , which has an extended shock - like region in the optical cospatial with a strong ir source indicative of buried star formation @xcite .",
    "indeed , as noted in @xcite , the total luminosity of the shocks in iras f01053 - 1746 is a negligible fraction of the bolometric luminosity , though they can still act as a means of removing energy from the infalling gas over the time scale of the merger process .",
    "regardless , the _ observable _ optical emission in our sample shows a combination of hii - region emission and ionization by slow shocks , increasing as a function of merger stage .",
    "this combination manifests in some systems as a `` composite '' spectrum , though in this case `` composite '' means starburst+shocks rather than starburst+agn .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we showed that when only nuclear spectra are considered , 75% of the `` composite '' galaxies in our sample are composite simply due to a sizable contribution from shocks to their emission line spectra .",
    "we have analyzed wifes optical integral field spectroscopic data cubes of 27 systems from the goals sample , 23 of which are a combination of at least two interacting galaxies , ranging from widely separated pairs approaching first pericenter to coalesced systems on their way to becoming elliptical merger remnants .",
    "our analysis focuses on continuum - subtracted emission line gas , in particular through a decomposition of individual emission line profiles into one , two or three distinct kinematic components .",
    "we use the results of our emission line fits to create line ratio maps , line diagnostic diagrams and velocity dispersion distributions for each individual galaxy observed .",
    "we consider h@xmath0-flux weighted line component velocity dispersion distributions to avoid over - weighting regions of low - surface brightness emission .",
    "the results from each galaxy are placed into bins according to merger stage and the evolution of the emission line ratios and velocity dispersions are tracked as a function of merger progress .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * isolated systems and wide pairs are dominated primarily by hii - region emission ( @xmath4975% and @xmath4955% of h@xmath0emission respectively ) , with line profiles primarily @xmath41 of a few tens of . * all interacting systems exhibit emission with slightly higher",
    "velocity dispersions ( 50<@xmath41<90 ) , likely associated with turbulent star formation ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "this component makes up roughly 30% of the total observed h@xmath0flux throughout the merger process . * closely interacting pairs and coalesced mergers show a strong @xmath41 component above 100  and an increasingly dominant contribution contribution from composite and liner - like emission line ratios . in the absence of an agn , we assume the broadened @xmath41 component above 90  is tracing an increasing fractional contribution from shocks , passing 50% of the total observed h@xmath0flux in the coalesced mergers .",
    "we consider the ifs data of 4 agn - dominated systems in our sample separately .",
    "the agn dominant systems are detected in [ ne v ] in the mid - ir and show agn - like x - ray colors and spectra in chandra and xmm - newton data @xcite .",
    "we consider the role that less dominant agn may play in the latest stage mergers in our system by using the mid - ir diagnostic 6.2@xmath11 m  pah eqw as a proxy for agn activity .",
    "our conclusions are :    * the 4 agn show a significant component at @xmath41 of 300 - 500  and emission line ratios clearly approaching and entering the seyfert region of the emission line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the agn also contain shock - like velocity dispersions , driven either by the agn itself , galactic winds ( observed in blue - shifted na d absorption ) or merger - induced gas flows * when the low 6.2@xmath11 m  eqw coalesced mergers are removed from the non - agn sample , the shock - like high-@xmath41 component increases to 70% of the observed h@xmath0emission in the remaining three systems .",
    "@xcite note that some galaxies show strong evidence for enhanced h@xmath50  emission due to starburst - driven outflows and shocks rather than agn , with correspondingly low pah 6.2@xmath11 m  eqw , lending further ambiguity to the picture .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy is clearly a powerful tool for distinguishing non - agn composite emission , particularly in systems where widespread shocked ism is expected due to a powerful starburst or an ongoing gas - rich interaction .",
    "recent multi - wavelength studies of systems from the goals sample and elsewhere have shown promising routes to further study the impact that shocks have on the environment of u / lirgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "new surveys of hundreds and thousands of galaxies with ifu spectroscopy , namely califa , sami and manga @xcite are revealing a complex mix of forces at work in less luminous galaxies , including liner excitation in non - mergers caused by shocks as well a warm ionized interstellar medium heated by old stars and uv photons that escape hii regions @xcite .",
    "the combination of complementary , resolved multi - wavelength data that probes the multiple sources of activity will be the key to understanding the complex interplay between star formation , shocks , agn and the ism in galaxies throughout the universe    the authors acknowledge arc support under discovery project dp0984657 .",
