    "dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxies in the universe . understanding their formation and evolution is an important step in understanding the evolution of all galaxies since they are likely the building blocks of more massive systems like the milky way . because the basic properties of dwarf galaxies ( luminosity , stellar and gaseous mass , star formation rate ( sfr ) , and metallicity ) are very different from those of massive galaxies , detailed studies of the former objects provide us with an important tool to understand better how the astrophysics of star formation and galaxy evolution depend on these characteristics .",
    "the dwarf galaxies of the local group , in particular , provide a wealth of information about their evolution ; unlike more distant objects , we are able to resolve them into individual stars to study the characteristics of their stellar populations and to create detailed star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",

    "consequently , ` stacked ' images that have relative photometric errors of @xmath810% were used rather than the ` photometric ' images since image processing , including co - addition and astrometric calibration , were already performed on the former .",
    "no photometric calibrations have yet been released for the v and i data . consequently , to calibrate the magnitude offsets between instrumental and true magnitudes , we compared our photometry to that of the photometrically calibrated hubble space telescope ( hst ) local group stellar photometry archive @xcite .",

    "as described in  2 we created a master photometry list , which includes detections in v , i , and all four irac bands .",

    "is segregated into sections consisting of blue objects ( a ) , agb stars ( b ) , rsgs ( c ) , and red giants ( d ) , enabling us to ascertain where these stellar types lie in the ir cmd ( described below ) , as the infrared colors of the objects detected with irac are much less sensitive to effective temperature than those in the optical .",
    "the loci of stellar types were conservatively chosen , with gaps between them , so that stars will not be misidentified solely due to photometric errors ( though as we discuss below , reddening from dust absorption can certainly lead to such misidentification ) .    the 3.6  absolute magnitude versus [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] ir cmd is shown in figure [ ir_cmd ] .",
    "the basic structure of the ir cmd is a vertical distribution of stars with [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] very near zero .",
    "this vertical feature contains all objects where both the 3.6 and 4.5  bands sample the rayleigh - jeans tail of the planck function .",
    "any unreddened object with spectral type earlier than g0 will have [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] very close to zero , while k0@xmath2m5 stars become progressively _ bluer _ to a color of @xmath20.25 due to co absorption at 4.6  @xcite .    a vector showing 10 visual magnitudes of extinction @xcite as well as the agb limit are included in the ir cmd .",
    "while the reddening vector takes into account the wavelength dependent extinction from dust , it does not include the circumstellar emission , which can be significant at longer wavelengths .",
    "the agb limit was determined by assuming a bolometric correction at 3.6  of + 3 magnitudes for an m5 star , + 2 magnitudes for a g0 star and m@xmath16=@xmath27.1 @xcite , and is depicted in figure [ ir_cmd ] as a line connecting the agb limit for these two stellar types . above the plotted agb limit",
    "we detect two optically classified rsgs and one optically classified agb star .",
    "the object optically classified as an agb star lies just within the blue boundary of region ( b ) and could easily be a slightly reddened rsg .",
    "there are also six objects brighter than , but redward of the agb limit that are optically classified as agb stars . based on their positions in the optical cmd , the",
    "brightest three of these six objects are likely reddened rsgs , while the fainter three are consistent with mass - losing agb stars ( see  [ mass_loss ] for a description of the effect of mass - loss on the [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] color ) .",
    "there is considerable overlap in the lower part of the ir cmd between stellar types .",
    "however , the luminosity of the red giant branch tip ( trgb ) does enable us to separate red giants from the other stellar types .",
    "figure [ lum_fn ] shows the 3.6  luminosity function for all objects detected at both 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "based on the abrupt drop in the 3.6  luminosity function , we adopt a 3.6  absolute magnitude of the trgb to be @xmath26.6 .",
    "this value for the trgb is slightly brighter than the value adopted by @xcite for the lmc ( l@xmath17  =  @xmath26.4 ) , though given the uncertainty in the distance modulus to wlm ( @xmath11 0.08 magnitudes ) and the bin size of our luminosity function ( 0.25 magnitudes ) these values agree reasonably well . for the objects detected at both 3.6 and 4.5 , 79% of the total 3.6  flux of 46.5 mjy",
    "is from stars brighter than the trgb , which are predominantly agb stars .",
    "the right panel of figure [ ir_cmd ] shows the ir cmd of objects detected in v , i , and at 3.6 and 4.5 , separated according to their optically selected stellar type .",
    "the optically detected agb stars have typical ir colors of @xmath20.25@xmath9[3.6]@xmath2[4.5]@xmath90.25 , with the exception of a few luminous red sources .",
    "the rsgs have a similar distribution , although no rsgs with red ir colors are detected , as any reddening would cause a rsg to be misidentified as an agb star in the optical .",
    "nearly all of the blue objects detected in the optical and ir are found between @xmath28@xmath9m@xmath13@xmath9@xmath25 and @xmath20.3@xmath9[3.6]@xmath2[4.5]@xmath90.5 .",
    "we also detect a few ir luminous ( m@xmath13  @xmath8  @xmath29 ) unresolved  regions that are coincident with strong h@xmath6 emission .",
    "the optically identified red giants are peaked at m@xmath13  =  @xmath26 , due to our completeness limit ( see figure [ ir_cmd ] ) , and have a large range in color @xmath20.5@xmath9[3.6]@xmath2[4.5]@xmath91 . as we will discuss in  [ complete ] ,",
    "there are also a large number of optically classified red giants that lie above the trgb in the ir , which are consistent with the colors of reddened agb stars .",
    "figure [ ch4_cmd ] is the cmd for all sources detected at both 3.6 and 8.0 . because of both reduced sensitivity ( 1-@xmath18 point source sensitivity of 4.4 @xmath19jy ) and fainter emission from stellar photospheres , we detect significantly fewer sources at 8.0  than in the shorter wavelength bands .",
    "however , the longer wavelength baseline can be useful for separating sources enshrouded in circumstellar material ( such as carbon stars ) due to the emission from dust at 8.0 . in this cmd ,",
    "apparently two separate populations are present ; a narrow distribution with @xmath212@xmath9m@xmath13@xmath9@xmath29 and [ 3.6]@xmath2[8.0 ]  @xmath8  0 that are indicative of the brightest agbs and rsgs that also have [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ]  @xmath8  0 , consistent with normal agbs or rsgs not undergoing mass - loss , and another , much broader , distribution with @xmath212@xmath9m@xmath13@xmath9@xmath29 and 1@xmath9[3.6]@xmath2[8.0 ]  @xmath94 that are likely agbs losing significant mass .    in figure [ xy ]",
    "we show the right ascension and declination of point sources based on their optical / ir classification .",
    "the optically classified blue objects are strongly concentrated in the regions of active star formation and the northern arc , while the agb stars are much more smoothly distributed .",
    "the red giants are also smoothly distributed over the face of wlm , though this plot shows the effect that crowding from both blue objects that are very bright in the optical , and red giants , whose stellar density increases toward the center of wlm , have on the completeness of fainter sources such as red giants ( e.g. , there are ` holes ' in the detected red giant distribution toward the center of wlm , particularly at the locations of recent star formation ) .",
    "table [ stats ] lists many of the detection statistics for our optical and infrared photometry . for the region in wlm with coverage in all four irac bands",
    "we detect 2855 , 2019 , 300 , and 122 point sources at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 , respectively . for the same region",
    "we detect 4989 objects in our matched v and i photometry .",
    "we find 46 objects ( 38% of all 8.0  detections ) that are detected in all four irac bands with no optical counterpart . of these",
    ", 5 have 3.6 and 4.5  fluxes consistent with rsg stars ( i.e. , they are above the agb limit ) , while the remaining 41 stars could be either rsgs or agbs .    in the ir cmd",
    "we find a population of bright , red objects to the right of the main vertical distribution of stars ranging from m@xmath13  =  @xmath210 and [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ]  =  0.3 to m@xmath13  =  @xmath27.5 and m@xmath13@xmath2[4.5 ]  =  1.2 .",
    "eleven of the 31 objects are detected in the optical , with seven being agb stars , two unresolved  regions coincident with strong h@xmath6 emission , and two objects that are probably foreground giants .",
    "it is likely that many of the objects not detected in the optical are dust enshrouded agb stars , since only the brightest and bluest of these objects are detected optically and the majority of these are optically classified as agbs ( see the discussion in  [ mass_loss ] ) .",
    "due to the micro - jy point source sensitivity of irac with our integration time , we should be able to detect the entire population of the agb stars in wlm , excluding only those objects that were not detected due to crowding .",
    "however , uniquely determining the true stellar types of the detected objects can be challenging , as the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these stellar types , with the exception of unresolved  regions , are indistinguishable from one another .",
    "figure [ sed ] shows the irac seds for the all of the agb stars , rsgs , and blue objects detected in all four irac bands and the lggs v and i images .",
    "this plot shows the similarity between the infrared fluxes of agbs and rsgs .",
    "although it is challenging to distinguish between agb stars and rsgs using irac data alone , the combination of optical and near - ir data provide a powerful method of detecting candidate agb stars in galaxies past the immediate vicinity of the milky way , since rsgs are generally easily identified in optical cmds .",
    "one of the goals of our study is to determine the fraction of agb stars seen in the ir that were not detected in the optical due to extinction by circumstellar material . to estimate this fraction",
    ", we make the approximation that all objects above the trgb in the ir cmd are agb stars . while there is contamination above the trgb from rsgs and blue objects ,",
    "the number of these objects detected in the optical contribute @xmath2010% of the population above the trgb in the ir .",
    "of the 691 stars brighter than the trgb in the ir , 39% are not detected in v and i. there are also 29 objects brighter than the trgb in the ir cmd , but lie within region ( d ) of the optical cmd ( the region surrounding red giants ) at positions such that they could have been reddened from above the trgb via the reddening vector shown in figure [ optical_cmd ] .",
    "we find it likely that these 29 objects are agb stars whose optical fluxes suffer extinction by circumstellar material .",
    "it is important to consider the effects of photometric scatter as well as errors due to blending , crowding , and even on our adopted value of the trgb on these completeness statistics . by shifting our adopted value of the trgb ( m@xmath13  =  @xmath26.6 ) up or down by 0.5 magnitudes , the fraction of optically detected agb stars changes by only a few percent",
    "this is not unexpected though .",
    "most of the agb stars detected in the ir but not in the optical are considerably brighter than the trgb , because the mass - loss phase that hides agb stars in the optical typically takes place at luminosities above the trgb . therefore ,",
    "even if a number of sources were scattered from above the trgb to below , or visa versa , the fraction of optically detected agb stars would change very little .",
    "this problem is more significant , however , for the number of agb stars misidentified as red giants because of the large number of optically identified red giants just below the trgb . if we shift the adopted value of the trgb to be 0.5 magnitudes fainter , the fraction of objects we would classify as agb stars in the ir , but optically identified as red giants would increase from 4% to 8% .",
    "because the average 3.6  photometric error at the trgb is only 0.1 magnitudes , it is unlikely that the fraction of agbs misidentified as sub - trgb red giants in the optical has been effected by more than 12% .",
    "further , in the most crowded region of our irac images , we detect only 0.04 stars at 3.6 and 4.5  per area the size of the 3.6 micron fwhm disk .",
    "consequently , we do not anticipate crowding or blending effects to contribute significantly to the overall photometric errors of our sources , although it certainly may affect some of them .    in summary",
    ", we find that 43% of the agb stars in wlm are enshrouded with enough material to make them either undetectable or misidentified in the optical cmd , even though in v and i the 50% completeness level is nearly three magnitudes below the trgb .",
    "this number of optically - undetected agb stars is consistent with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that find a significant fraction of the agb population ( in particular the carbon stars ) in an obscured state .",
    "future investigations of other galaxies from this same observing program will allow us to determine the dependence of this fraction on the metallicity of the host system .",
    "it should again be noted that we are ignoring the faint end of the agb distribution , i.e. , any agbs fainter than the trgb .",
    "the completeness fraction discussed above has important implications for the intermediate age sfh one would derive from galaxies like wlm .",
    "programs that derive sfhs from optical cmds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would tend to over - predict the number of detected agb stars , based on the number of main sequence stars , since many of the agbs have been reddened beyond the optical detection limit .",
    "consequently , it is important to apply either corrections to the number counts in this part of the cmd , or weighting functions to give more confidence to the number of detected intermediate age main sequence stars , rather than the agb stars .",
    "as shown here , at least for wlm , there must be allowance for a factor of 2 in the disparity between the number of main sequence and agb stars used to measure the intermediate age star formation rate .",
    "if such disparities are not accounted for , one will underestimate the true star formation rate over the past few gyr .",
    "@xcite studied the carbon stars in wlm using narrow - band optical filters centered on the cn and tio absorption features . at 3.6 and 4.5",
    "we detect nearly all of the 111 carbon stars detected by @xcite that are within our coverage area ( our entire irac coverage area is within the @xcite field ) .",
    "the remaining 11 objects were not detected in the irac data due to crowding , but were detected in the @xcite optical data . in figure [ bat_cmd ]",
    "we plot our irac photometry of the carbon stars identified by @xcite .",
    "the carbon stars span a relatively wide range of absolute 3.6  magnitudes ( from 15.75 to 18 ) and [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors ( from @xmath20.3 to 0.6 ) .",
    "the @xcite photometry is valuable in its ability to distinguish between carbon - rich and oxygen - rich agb stars .",
    "however , the 111 carbon stars and 12 m - type agbs detected in the @xcite study comprise only @xmath818% of the agb stars detected in our irac data .",
    "this is surprising , given that the broadband portion of their data are shown to be complete 1 magnitude below the trgb , and other comparable studies @xcite have estimated completeness near 90% .",
    "there are two explanations that could lead to this disparity .",
    "either @xcite have overestimated their completeness limit , or in this work we have underestimated the contamination above the trgb from stellar types other than agb stars .",
    "we know from comparison with the optical data (  [ photometry ] ) that at least 10% of the stars above the trgb in the ir are not agb stars .",
    "however , for contamination of other stellar types to be solely responsible for the difference between these two studies , this fraction would need to be 90% , i.e. , there would need to be vastly more optically undetected rsgs , foreground stars , or other objects besides agbs .",
    "this seems unlikely , considering the relative number of optically detected rsgs and agbs shown in figure [ optical_cmd ] , and the very small number of expected foreground stars .",
    "it is clear from figure [ bat_cmd ] that the carbon stars detected in the narrow - band study have relatively blue [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors , with only very bright carbon stars being detected with even moderately red colors .",
    "we also detect a number of objects with m@xmath13 between @xmath27 ( i.e. , the faintest carbon stars detected by the narrow - band study ) and the trgb .",
    "the red agbs that were not detected by @xcite can be explained by circumstellar material reddening them beyond their detection limits . however , the faint agbs with blue [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors that were not detected are somewhat more perplexing . because agb stars can not become carbon stars until after thermal",
    "pulsing begins ( when they are somewhat brighter than the trgb ) , we would expect the region between the trgb and the faintest carbon stars to be filled with oxygen - rich agbs . if the agbs we detect between the trgb and the faintest carbon stars are oxygen - rich agbs , they would not be expected to have significant mass - loss rates , and consequently should be detectable in the optical .",
    "one possible explanation for these non - detections is that a brightness limit in the @xcite data was created by the requirement that the combined broad- and narrow - band photometric errors be small , which would tend to remove faint , low signal - to - noise detections .",
    "there are also a number of objects with m@xmath13 between @xmath27 and the trgb that have red [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors . because agbs just above the trgb are not expected to have large mass - loss rates , the red colors of many of these objects are likely due to point source blending or photometric scatter , rather than objects with significant mass - loss .",
    "it is instructive to compare these completeness results with the deep near - ir imaging of ngc  6822 by @xcite .",
    "they detect a total of 6195 agb stars in their j and k@xmath21 imaging ; of which 4684 are oxygen - rich and 1511 carbon - rich for a carbon star to m - type agb ( c / m ) ratio of 0.32 .",
    "when including i , j , and k@xmath21 they find 2161 oxygen - rich and 500 carbon - rich agbs for a c / m ratio of 0.23 .",
    "this is in comparison with the @xmath81800 agb stars ( 904 carbon stars and c / m  =  1.0@xmath110.2 ) detected in the narrow - band optical study of ngc  6822 by @xcite .",
    "the fraction of agbs ( both c and m - type ) detected in the optical study of @xcite is somewhat artificially inflated though , since the field of view of their study was larger than that in the near - ir study of @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to note that while the @xcite optical study detected significantly fewer agbs total , the c / m ratio they found was higher .",
    "this is contrary to what we would predict , given the assumption that carbon stars should be more difficult to detect in the optical .",
    "it is not clear what the implications of this incompleteness are for studies of the effect of host galaxy metallicity on the c / m ratio .",
    "because agb winds composed of oxygen - rich compounds are less efficient at absorbing visible photons than those that are carbon - rich @xcite , optical studies should be more adept at detecting m - type rather than carbon - rich agbs .",
    "consequently , the incompleteness of the @xcite study may mean the c / m ratio may be even higher than the value they derive , c / m  =  12.4 , with a large uncertainty because of the difficulty in distinguishing between m - type agbs and foreground galactic dwarfs .",
    "on the other hand , there are a number of agbs not detected in the @xcite study between the trgb and the faintest carbon stars , which is where we would expect oxygen - rich agbs to reside .",
    "this leads us to conclude that many more m - type agbs were not detected , lowering the assumed c / m ratio .",
    "shorter - wavelength near - ir images of wlm ( such as in the j , h , and k@xmath21 bands ) would be extremely useful in this case , since they could be used to distinguish between oxygen- and carbon - rich agb stars and are also less effected by extinction from circumstellar material than the optical studies .      using the dust radiative transfer models from @xcite",
    ", we can estimate wind optical depths ( @xmath22 ) and mass - loss rates ( mlrs ) for the agb stars in our irac data .",
    "@xcite presents a number of models including carbon- and oxygen - rich agbs and post - agbs with varying effective temperatures and wind compositions ( including amorphous carbon ( amc ) and silicon carbide ( sic ) for the carbon stars and aluminum oxide ( alox ) and silicates ( si ) for oxygen - rich agbs ) . in figure [ groen ]",
    "we show representative models , displayed as tracks indicating where an agb in wlm would move with increasing @xmath22 or mlr of a given composition .    for the carbon - rich agbs",
    ", these models show very little difference in the position on the cmd between winds composed of 100% amc or 85% amc and 15% sic . at large @xmath22",
    "there is also very little difference between effective temperatures ranging from 2650 k to 3600 k. at small @xmath22 ( @xmath23  @xmath8  10@xmath24 ) , cooler effective temperatures correspond to the same m@xmath13 magnitude but redder [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors .",
    "if the main vertical distribution in our ir cmd is composed of carbon stars with negligible mlrs , the majority have effective temperatures slightly cooler than 3600 k. it is interesting to note that while some of the spread in color of the vertical distribution is certainly due to increasing photometric scatter with increasing m@xmath13 magnitude , this spread is also consistent with the range of modeled effective temperatures .    for the oxygen - rich agbs at a given effective temperature ,",
    "varying the composition of the wind from 100% alox , to 60% si and 40% alox , and to 100% si yield tracks roughly the same shape .",
    "however , increasing the si fraction shifts the tracks redward .",
    "changing the spectral type for a given wind composition from m0 to m6 to m10 produces brighter m@xmath13 magnitudes and redder [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors .",
    "because of the similarities between the tracks of oxygen- and carbon - rich agbs , we can not distinguish between them in our cmd .",
    "however , we can still investigate the mlrs of agb stars by comparing the distribution of our sources to the various models .",
    "the [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] color of agb stars corresponds to a unique @xmath22 , which in turn corresponds to a mlr , scaled by the square root of the stellar luminosity and by the inverse of the dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath25 ) for a given stellar / wind composition , as prescribed by @xcite .",
    "we calculated the total mlrs by binning the agbs according to the modeled optical depths and applying the appropriately scaled mlr , given the stellar color and luminosity .",
    "@xcite estimates the metallicity of wlm 1 - 2.5 gyr ago ( an appropriate timescale for the formation of the current agb population ) to be [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath21.13 , while the current metallicity of wlm , as measured by both the nebular oxygen abundance @xcite and blue supergiants @xcite is [ o / h ]  =  @xmath20.8 .",
    "these upper and lower limits give us a reasonable range of values for the expected metallicities of the agb population , and also allow us to estimate an uncertainty in the calculated mlrs . assuming the dust - to - gas ratio scales as @xmath25  =  @xmath26  10@xmath27}$ ] and @xmath26  =  0.005 @xcite , we adopt @xmath28  =  3.7 - 7.9@xmath29 .    if the entire agb population is composed of carbon - rich agbs with t@xmath30  =  3600 k and wind composition of 85% amc and 15% sic we derive a total mlr of  =  1.1 - 2.4@xmath010@xmath1 .",
    "if instead we assume a population with the same properties except t@xmath30  =  2650 k , we find a similar total mlr of  =  0.9 - 1.9@xmath010@xmath1 .",
    "in both of these cases we are not including the contribution from sources bluer than the model colors ; however , these objects contribute a negligible amount to the total mlr . ninety percent of the total mlr from both models are from sources with [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ]  @xmath31  0.5 , and over 50% of the mass - loss is from sources with [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ]  @xmath31  1.0 .",
    "the total mlrs are a factor of 3.3 higher if the population is composed of oxygen - rich agbs with 60% silicate and 40% alox winds , and a factor of 2.9 higher for oxygen - rich agbs with 100% silicate winds .",
    "we are particularly interested in the sources redward of the main stellar distribution ( shown in the box in the right panel of figure [ groen ] ) .",
    "these sources are well modeled by both oxygen - rich agbs with @xmath23  =  3.0 and carbon - rich agbs with @xmath23  =  0.54 .",
    "the only models ruled out by these data are an entire population of oxygen - rich agbs with a wind composed of 100% aluminum oxide ( at any t@xmath30 ) , since even at the largest modeled @xmath22 ( @xmath23  =  18.5 ) these objects do not become red enough to reproduce the observed distribution .",
    "it is appropriate to calculate a more conservative mlr , based solely on these objects , since many sources that are consistent with having moderate mlrs may have artificially red colors due to photometric scatter and/or point source blending .",
    "the mlrs calculated using only these objects are 0.8 - 1.6@xmath010@xmath1  for carbon stars with t@xmath30  =  3600",
    "k and 0.7 - 1.4@xmath010@xmath1  for t@xmath30  =  2600 k. this box was chosen somewhat arbitrarily , however , moving the blue boundary of the box to include agbs with moderate [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors changes the total mlr by less than 10% , since the overall mass - loss is dominated by the handful of very red sources .    because the mass - loss rates we derive are so strongly dependent on the few reddest sources in this galaxy , it is imperative that we be confident that these sources are real and have not been created by photometric errors or the faulty merging of photometry from different filters . of the 33 sources in the ` conservative ' box in figure [ groen ] , all",
    "are also detected at 5.8  and all but one are detected at 8.0 .",
    "additionally , the seds of these objects show no unexpected features , such as those that would be obvious if the the flux in one filter from a red giant was merged with the other three filters from an agb star .",
    "some caution is in order here , however , because the total mass - loss in wlm is dominated by only a few sources and the super - wind phase of mass - loss for an individual agb star is very short ( @xmath8 5@xmath010@xmath32 years ; @xcite ) compared to evolutionary timescale for the entire stellar population .",
    "consequently , the mass - loss measured at the present epoch may not be representative of the average mass - loss over an extended period in the galaxy .",
    "we compare these mass - loss values with the models from @xcite which estimate the return of material into the ism from a single - age stellar population .",
    "they find 26 - 46% of the initial stellar mass is returned into the ism via supernovae and agb winds , depending on the assumed imf , and show most of this material is returned within the first gyr .",
    "@xcite finds the star formation rate over the last gyr in one hst / wfpc2 field in wlm to be 1@xmath010@xmath1 . within this wfpc2 field",
    "we detect seven agbs in the ir that contribute a total mlr of 1.8 - 3.8@xmath010@xmath24 .",
    "consequently , our conservative mlr represents a 18 - 38% return of mass into the ism .",
    "@xcite showed that about half of the total mass - loss an agb star experiences occurs in the dust - enshrouded phase . because the agbs we use to calculate this rate all have red [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors that are indicative of the dust - enshrouded phase , to estimate the total mass - loss from these objects it is reasonable to adjust this value upward by a factor of two , to 36 - 76% .",
    "these values are probably overestimated , given that they are higher than the @xcite prediction and we are not measuring the contribution of material from supernovae and massive agbs that have already died .",
    "some possible explanations for this overestimation are the lower limit for our assumed dust - to - gas ratio may be too low , which would increase the derived mlr for a given wind optical depth , and also any ` burstiness ' in the true star formation rate , which could either raise or lower the calculated fraction being returned to the ism compared to the average value over the past gyr . given the fluctuations observed in the star formation histories of dis , the factor of two agreement is probably quite reasonable .",
    "in figure [ comp_frac ] we show a histogram of the fraction of objects brighter than the trgb that were detected in the optical as a function of [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] color ( left panel ) and optical depth for carbon - rich agbs with 85% amc and 15% sic wind and two different effective temperatures ( right panel ) .",
    "this figure clearly shows the trend of decreasing optical completeness with increasing mlr , which supports our conclusion that the agb stars misidentified or not detected in the optical have been reddened by circumstellar material .",
    "@xcite report that there are very few optically detected carbon stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) with mlrs above 10@xmath33 , and none above 10@xmath34 .",
    "they adopt a value of  =  5@xmath010@xmath33  as the critical value above which no carbon star will be detected optically .",
    "we detect no agbs optically with [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ]  @xmath31  1.0 ( @xmath22  =  1.3 ,  @xmath8  5@xmath010@xmath34  assuming l  =  3000 l@xmath35 ) and only one with [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ]  @xmath31  0.85 ( @xmath22  =  0.7 ,  @xmath8  2@xmath010@xmath34 ) out of the 14 agbs detected in the ir . given the difference in metallicity of the lmc and wlm ( @xmath8 0.7 dex ) and its effect on the derived mlr , these values are in agreement with the @xcite result .    figure [ mbol ] shows the mlr versus bolometric luminosity for all of the objects brighter than the trgb in our ir cmd .",
    "filled circles represent the mlrs and luminosities assuming all of the agbs are carbon - rich with dust - to - gas ratios of 7.9@xmath010@xmath24 , winds composed of 85% amc and 15% sic , and t@xmath30  =  2650 k. open circles are for the same composition with t@xmath30  =  3600 k. we also show the classical single - scattering mass - loss limit ( bottom dashed line ) and the empirical maximum mass - loss limit found for the lmc ( top solid line ) as plotted in @xcite .",
    "because we do not know the effective stellar temperature a priori , some mlrs can be overestimated in the case of the t@xmath30  =  3600 k template or underestimated for t@xmath30  =  2650 k , since there is a degeneracy in our cmds between stars with cool effective temperatures and stars with warmer effective temperatures but significant mlrs .",
    "consequently , some caution should be taken in strictly interpreting this plot .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio assumed for this plot is the upper limit of the two values we consider in this paper . by instead assuming the lower limit ,",
    "all mass - loss rates would be scaled upward by approximately a factor of two .    despite these uncertainties",
    ", there is a remarkable consistency between the agb populations of wlm and both the lmc and smc @xcite . under the assumption of t@xmath30",
    "=  2650 k , the empirical maximum mlr found in the lmc by @xcite is in excellent agreement with the agbs in wlm .",
    "we also detect many agbs that are consistent with @xmath36  =  10@xmath37  and m@xmath16  =  @xmath24 .",
    "agbs with these properties were also seen in the lmc @xcite , though relatively few due to sensitivity considerations .",
    "@xcite show that these objects could not exist if the wind - driving mechanism was purely by the classical method of radiation pressure accelerating dust grains whose momenta are coupled to circumstellar gas @xcite .",
    "these observations support those of @xcite , suggesting another mechanism may be at work .",
    "one of the reasons for observing galaxies in the ir is to obtain accurate measurements of their stellar masses . when using luminosity measurements to estimate stellar masses at any wavelength , it is important to understand the stellar types contributing to that luminosity . in the optical ,",
    "the luminosity can be dominated by massive , young stars that describe only the very recent star formation rate , while in the near - ir the luminosity is from old red giants ( in the short - wavelength near - ir ) or intermediate age agb stars ( in the irac bands ) .",
    "nearby galaxies offer us the opportunity to determine precisely which stars contribute to a galaxy s total luminosity as a function of wavelength . as we note in  [ agb ] , for the point sources detected at 3.6 and 4.5",
    ", 79% of the total flux is from agb stars , in contrast with optical and shorter wavelength near - ir studies .",
    "@xcite used 4.5  luminosities to estimate total stellar masses of nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "we recover 83% of the total 4.5  flux @xcite find for wlm in point sources we detect at both 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "although the 4.5  luminosity of wlm is dominated by the light from agb stars , because the evolutionary phase of agb star production is relatively long , the 4.5 luminosity is a fairly robust measure of the stellar mass ( i.e. , short - term variations in the sfh are averaged out ) .",
    "however , for smaller galaxies or galaxies with unusual sfhs , the 4.5  luminosity may be less directly connected to the stellar mass .",
    "@xcite provided a method of estimating the masses of stellar clusters based on the number of stars brighter than the trgb in the l@xmath17 band ( 3.76 ) and the age of the cluster . performing this calculation for wlm",
    "is somewhat difficult because , unlike stellar clusters , its stellar population is not single aged .",
    "however , by adopting an age of 2 gyr for the stellar population ( i.e. , the age of the recent star forming event that formed a significant fraction of the stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we arrive at a total stellar mass of 1.1@xmath010@xmath38",
    ". because of the range in age of the stellar population and our incomplete sky coverage this value is probably uncertain by at least 50% ; however , it is reasonably consistent with the @xcite value of 1.8@xmath010@xmath38 .",
    "we have presented /irac imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "v and i optical data from the lggs @xcite were combined with these observations to help determine the stellar types of objects detected in the ir .",
    "we find that above the trgb at 3.6 , 39% of the objects were undetected in the optical and 43% were undetected or misidentified , even though the @xcite data are 50% complete 3 magnitudes below the trgb .",
    "it is likely that many of these objects were not detected in the optical due to dust production in the winds of the agb stars , which efficiently absorb visible photons while ir radiation is relatively unaffected .    comparing our photometry with the narrow - band optical study of wlm @xcite",
    ", we detect nearly all of the objects they classify as carbon stars with a few exceptions , mostly due to crowding effects .",
    "however , of the 691 stars we detect and classify as agbs only 18% were detected by the narrow - band study .",
    "it is unclear what effect this may have on the assumed c / m ratio , since there is evidence that both mass - losing carbon stars and m - type agbs both escaped detection in the @xcite study .",
    "additionally , we detect a significant population of objects with positions on the ir cmd consistent with mass - losing agbs . for these objects",
    "we derive a conservative total mlr for the galaxy of 0.7 - 1.6@xmath010@xmath1  yr@xmath4 , assuming the entire population is composed of carbon stars .",
    "if we include all of our 3.6 and 4.5  detections , we find a total mlr of up to 0.9 - 2.4@xmath010@xmath1  yr@xmath4 , which is likely an overestimate due to the inclusion of objects photometrically scattered to their relatively red positions in the ir cmd .    for the region of the galaxy covered by the hst / wfpc2 study of @xcite ,",
    "we find 36 - 76% of the initial mass in stars formed over the last gyr is currently being returned into the ism via mass - loss from agb stars , assuming half of the total mass lost by an agb star occurs in the dust enshrouded phase .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than expected , given a total of 26 - 46% is estimated to be returned from the entire stellar population @xcite , and our data are not sensitive to the contribution from supernovae and agbs that have already died .",
    "the prescription we use may systematically overestimate the mlrs .",
    "we find the distribution of mlrs and bolometric luminosities of agbs and rsgs are very similar to those in the lmc and smc @xcite and the empirically derived maximum mlr of the lmc @xcite is in excellent agreement with our data .    finally , we show that the agb stars , which trace the intermediate age stellar population , provide the dominant contribution to the luminosity in the irac bands , while studies at shorter wavelengths can preferentially detect either much younger sources ( in the optical ) or older age populations ( short - wavelength near - ir ) .",

    "<S> we find 39% of the infrared - detected agb stars are not detected in the optical data , even though our 50% completeness limit is three magnitudes fainter than the red giant branch tip . </S>",
    "<S> an additional 4% of the infrared - detected agbs are misidentified in the optical , presumably due to reddening by circumstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results with those of a narrow - band optical carbon star survey of wlm , and find the latter study sensitive to only 18% of the total agb population . </S>",
    "<S> we detect objects with infrared fluxes consistent with them being mass - losing agb stars , and derive a present day total mass - loss rate from the agb stars of  =  0.7 - 2.4@xmath010@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of mass - loss rates and bolometric luminosities of agbs and red supergiants are very similar to those in the lmc and smc and the empirical maximum mass - loss rate observed in the lmc and smc is in excellent agreement with our wlm data . </S>"
