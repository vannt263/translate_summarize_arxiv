    "since the concept of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) was originally put forward by bose and einstein , the dilute bose gas , as a many - body system which displays macroscopic quantum phenomena such as superfluidity , has been extensively studied theoretically .",
    "the microscopic description of bec started with bogoliubov theory@xcite , in which the destruction and creation operators for the macroscopically - occupied lowest - energy mode is specially treated as c numbers , known as bogoliubov replacement . based on bogoliubov replacement ,",
    "the green s function methods were applied to a dilute bose gas at zero temperature key-5,key-6,key-7 .",
    "hugenholtz and pines @xcite showed that for a repulsive interaction , the pole of the one - particle green s function , approaches zero for zero momentum , which means a gapless excitation spectrum ( usually we call it as goldstone theorem @xcite ) .",
    "hohenberg and p.c .",
    "martin described bec as spontaneous global @xmath0 symmetry breaking by introducing external sources , which are set negligibly small in the end key-8 .",
    "the interpretation of bec as symmetry breaking makes the quantum field - theoretic treatment very convenient , in which the expectation value of the field operator describes the density as well as the wavefunction of the condensed bosons and hence is also called `` macroscopic wavefunction '' .",
    "the effective action approach @xcite is usually employed and kinds of approximations can be easily formulated in this framework , such as bogoliubov approximation , popov approximation and hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation as discussed in detail in the references @xcite .",
    "however for the bosonic model , if we use the simplest non - perturbative calculation , hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation , the spectrum obtained is gapped even in the broken phase .",
    "goldstone theorem is violated in such approximation @xcite .",
    "though in the popov approximation , the spectrum remains gapless , the method is not self - consistent and we will also show that we can not apply this method to one dimensional bosonic model .",
    "@xmath1 derivable theory , self - consistent approximation method beyond hfb , including some higher two particle irreducible ( 2pi ) diagrams to the effective action , is often used in studying bec systems .",
    "the spectrum obtained in the @xmath2 derivable theory is also gapped @xcite .    in the self - consistent theories such as hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation ,",
    "the ward identity from @xmath0 symmetry is not preserved due to partial resummations of some feymann diagrams .",
    "therefore , the goldstone theorem is violated and the resulting excitation spectrum is gapped even in the symmetry breaking phase .  in order to preserve the ward identity , we should incorporate the contributions of some other feymann diagrams and thereby remove the gap @xcite .",
    "it is called `` covariant gaussian approximation '' in @xcite and we will call it `` improved gaussian approximation '' ( iga ) . in principle",
    "we can apply similar method to the @xmath2 derivable theory beyond hfb ( we will call it the improved @xmath2 derivable theory , or idt in short ) , but the theory becomes too complex ( involving integral equations which can not be solved analytically ) @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "interest in 1d bose gas has been revived due to its experimental realization with ultracold bosonic atoms key-22,key-23,key-24,key-25 . in one dimension ( 1d ) , at finite temperature",
    ", the excitation spectra are gapped .",
    "however , the 1d bose gas at zero temperature contains gapless spectra and the system is algebraic long range order . in a trapped 1d gas , the bose - einstein condensation ( bec )",
    "regimes of a true condensate , quasicondensate regime and the regime of a trapped tonks gas ( gas of impenetrable bosons ) at finite temperature have been identified in @xcite .",
    "the stability and phase coherence of trapped 1d bose gases was studied in @xcite .",
    "most of the other relevant works are summarized in the review article @xcite . in highly anisotropic traps , where the axial motion of the atoms is weakly confined while the radial motion is frozen by the tight transverse confinement",
    ", the shape of the bose - condensed systems reduces to one dimension .",
    "if the characteristic range of the interatomic potential is much smaller than the typical length of the radial extension , the system can be described by the lieb - liniger model @xcite , in which the contact potential strength @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the 1d scattering length@xcite .",
    "the lieb - liniger model can be exactly solved by the bethe ansatz and two types of excitations ( named type i and type ii ) have been found .",
    "type i excitations are gapless with a linear dispersion in the long wavelength limit and reduce to the bogoliubov excitations in the weak coupling limit .",
    "type ii excitations , the fermionic excitations which are prominent in the strong coupling regime , have no equivalent in the bogoliubov theory . j. s. caux _",
    "_ et al.__key-29 studied the one - particle dynamical correlation function of the lieb ",
    "liniger model by using the abacus method @xcite , for a wide range of values of the interaction parameter .    in this paper",
    "we will apply iga to the 1d bose gas at zero temperature .",
    "this system can be described by the lieb - liniger model ( llm ) , which has been exactly solved by the bethe ansatz .",
    "we can compare the result of the iga method with the exact one in order to test the precision and validity of the iga method . in the future",
    ", we shall apply iga to 2d or 3d bose gas at finite temperature , as in high dimension we can not apply the bethe ansatz method to obtain the exact solution , iga or idt is the only approach we can rely on . in higher dimension , the quantum and thermal fluctuations are weaker than in 1d , the result obtained by iga or idt should be better qualitatively and quantitatively than that in 1d .    in this paper , we shall study llm by using iga , and focus our attention on the excitation spectrum .",
    "we will follow @xcite and present iga method by solving dyson - schwinger equations which are generated by functional differentiation of the effective action .",
    "we will show that only the bogoliubov excitation spectrum ( or type i excitation ) can be obtained by iga . by comparing with the results of the bogoliubov approximation and type i excitation based on the exact solution @xcite , we find that the spectrum obtained in this way is good improvement to the spectrum in the bogoliubov approximation . in order to obtain type ii excitation , we speculate that we shall use more general @xmath6 derivable theory beyond iga ( we will leave it as our future work ) .",
    "if we study high dimension bosonic system , there will be no type ii excitation , iga will give more accurate results quantitatively .",
