    "in recent years we have been scrutinizing planck scale physics through many theories , proposals , ideas , etc , all this effort expended in order to improve our understanding of the nature behaviour at shortest distances ( as well as in the beginning our universe @xcite ) . in particular , it is widely aimed by these proposals achieve a better description of a quantum theory of gravity , or at least to make contact with the phenomenology of quantum gravity and hence gain insights about the fundamental structure of space and time at planck scale .    within the class of theories to describe planck scale physics , at the quantum realm",
    ", we can cite string theory and loop quantum gravity as those most prominent candidates up - to - date .",
    "our main interest is to put at the same level a steady description of both quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "an interesting outcome of these proposals is the presence of a minimal measurable length scale @xcite , this can be incorporate at the quantum theory by the so - called generalized uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "another consequence of known theories of quantum gravity is the breaking of ( some ) symmetry groups . in particular",
    ", a well known scrutinized consequence is the violation of the underlying lorentz symmetry @xcite , since a definitive description of the space - time is expected not to be in terms of a classical smooth geometry .    among the broad class of attempts trying to encompass and describe consistently lorentz violating effects @xcite",
    ", we shall focus in exploring features of very special relativity ( vsr ) @xcite in this paper .",
    "the cornerstone from this proposal is that the laws of physics are not invariant under the whole poincar group but rather are invariant under subgroups of the poincar group preserving the basic elements of special relativity , but at the same time enhancing the lorentz algebra by modifying the dynamics of particles .",
    "for instance , conservation laws and the usual relativistic dispersion relation , @xmath1 for a particle of mass m , etc , are preserved in this case .",
    "in particular , within this proposal , one can use in the realization of vsr the representations of the full lorentz group but supplemented by a lorentz - violating factor , such that the symmetry of the lagrangian is then reduced to one of the vsr subgroups of the lorentz group .",
    "these effects can then be encoded in the form lorentz - violating terms in the lagrangian that are necessarily nonlocal . as an example",
    ", one can observe that a vsr - covariant dirac equation has the form @xmath2 where the wiggle operator is defined such as @xmath3 , with the chosen preferred null direction @xmath4 so that it transforms multiplicatively under a vsr transformation .",
    "next , we can square the vsr - covariant dirac equation , and we find @xmath5 we thus immediately realize an interesting observable consequence of vsr that is to provide a novel mechanism for introducing neutrino masses without the need for new particles @xcite",
    ". moreover , the vsr parameter @xmath6 sets the scale for the vsr effects . among the most interesting analysis involving vsr effects",
    "we can cite a realization of vsr via a lightlike noncommutative deformation of poincar symmetry @xcite , studies on dirac equation @xcite and hydrogen atom @xcite , as well as gauge theories @xcite and curved spacetime field theories @xcite , gravitational and cosmological models @xcite .",
    "as it concerns our interest , vsr - effects have been discussed in the context of @xmath7-dims electromagnetic theories : abelian and non - abelian maxwell theories @xcite , chern - simons theory @xcite and born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite . by different reasons ,",
    "we have seen recently a renewed interest in studying lorentz - violating modifications of the maxwell - chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "although of the interesting features obtained in those analysis , one may wonder what the ( nonlocal ) vsr - effects may influence the behaviour of a lower - dimensional electromagnetic theory , for instance in a @xmath8-dimensional spacetime @xcite , where we will work with the sim@xmath0 subgroup ( of the @xmath9 lorentz group ) that preserve all the aforementioned conditions , in particular that a given null - vector is preserved up to a rescaling .",
    "subgroup can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ]    it worth notice that different approaches have been used to consider mass effects in @xmath8-dims generalized electrodynamic theories @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) electrodynamics describe a single massive gauge mode of helicity @xmath10 , the so - called topologically massive electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "hence , we expect that the vsr setting will not modify maxwell - chern - simons theory only by adding massive effects , since a topological mass is already present , but rather that the vsr - effects will be prominent in changing the theory s dynamics in a significant and novel manner .",
    "in this letter we will examine the maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics in a vsr setting .",
    "we start sec.[sec2 ] by reviewing the fundamental aspects from the sim@xmath0vsr gauge invariance , which allow us to determine the vsr - modified abelian field strength to be used in our analysis . in sec.[sec3 ] , we define our sim@xmath0vsr maxwell - chern - simons theory . afterwards , we determine the dispersion relation and discuss the electrostatic solution for the equations of motion in the presence of a pointlike charge .",
    "in addition , we compute the field energy and gauge - invariant potential between two opposite charges . along the analysis",
    "we will comment at pertinent points the differences obtained by vsr deformations in view of the usual mcs theory . in sec.[sec4 ] we summarize the results , and present our final remarks .",
    "let us start by discussing the sim@xmath0 vsr gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "an important remark to bear is that although the vsr subgroups do not admit invariant tensors , they select a preferred null direction . for this matter , the first point in order to develop the gauge invariance is to realize that the gauge transformation of a gauge field in vsr is modified so that @xmath11 where the wiggle operator is defined such as @xmath3 , but now with the chosen preferred null direction given as @xmath12 and multiplicatively covariant under the sim@xmath0 subgroup of the @xmath8-dims lorentz group @xcite .",
    "next , let us consider a charged scalar field @xmath13 with an infinitesimal gauge transformation given as usual by @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , we know that in general a covariant derivative must satisfy the transformation property @xmath15 hence , it can be showed that the covariant operator defined as the following @xmath16 satisfies the condition . besides , in the same way as we have defined the wiggle operator @xmath17 from the raw derivative @xmath18 , we can generalize the covariant derivative @xmath19 to a wiggle operator @xmath20 so that it reduces to the operator @xmath17 when the limit @xmath21 is taken .    hence , with the above definitions the field strength associated to the operator @xmath22 can be computed as usual by the following quantity @xmath23\\varphi =- if_{\\mu\\nu}\\varphi$ ] .",
    "this can be shown to result into @xmath24 this field strength can be seen as the raw definition of the @xmath25 gauge field strength .",
    "however , one can easily realize that this field - strength does not coincide with the sim@xmath0 wiggle operator @xmath26 on one hand , the wiggle definition @xmath27 is gauge invariant and it will be used to describe massive gauge fields .",
    "now , on the other hand , we can realize that the difference between the raw and wiggle field - strength must be gauge invariant as well , so that we can write the following expression for wiggle field strength @xmath28    some remarks are now in place . by means of illustration , in showing how to describe massive gauge fields ,",
    "let us consider a vsr modified maxwell action , @xmath29\\label{eq:1.8}\\ ] ] it is interesting to notice that this action can be augmented by further quadratic terms in * @xmath30 * as well as by gauge invariant coupling to matter fields @xcite .",
    "in particular , this prescription also works to generates mass for the matter fields .",
    "the field equations follow straightforwardly as @xmath31 now , by taking a vsr - type lorenz gauge condition , @xmath32 , we find that @xmath33    with this discussion we see that a massive gauge field , defined in terms of the ordinary derivative , can be described suitably in a gauge - invariant fashion when written in terms of the wiggle operator . moreover , this may be considered our starting point in defining our model of interest .",
    "by means of discussion , let us now add a ( electrostatic ) source term @xmath45 into the lagrangian . thus , a new set of field equations now read @xmath46 hence , for the temporal component of , we find a modified gauss s law @xmath47 where we have defined the wiggle electric and magnetic fields such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "besides , it follows that for @xmath50 in , we have the relation @xmath51 finally , we can use the relation to rewrite in the following form , @xmath52    in particular , we can consider a simple scenario in order to solve ( i.e. eq . ) , this can be chosen by taking the current density for a pointlike charge @xmath53 .",
    "hence , one can easily solve to find @xmath54 finally , we can determine the electric field by replacing back into @xmath55 one can see that the wiggle derivative results into @xmath56 , where the unit vector is given as @xmath57 .",
    "let us now concentrate in computing the nonlocal term of the above expression .",
    "this can be worked out by means of the following representation @xmath58 besides , the above derivative has been calculated by means of standard manipulations : one can make use of newton s binominal to rewrite @xmath59 conveniently as @xmath60 , so that we can compute the operation @xmath61 .",
    "finally , one can solve the integration in and find that @xmath62\\right)\\right]+\\lim _ { \\rho \\rightarrow \\infty}\\lambda\\left(\\rho\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq:2.17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus see in that as a consequence of the nonlocality of the vsr - effects the distribution @xmath63 $ ] is not regular , diverging as @xmath64 .",
    "nonetheless , in the first term of , we have a finite and well - behaved contribution , which we shall consider in our following analysis while disregarding the non - regular @xmath65 contribution .",
    "this approximation is valid since the finite part is sufficient to propagate vsr deviations .",
    "therefore , from the above discussion , we find that the wiggle electric field is then given by @xmath66\\right)\\right]\\right].\\label{eq:2.12}\\ ] ] the complete expression for the electric field can be rewritten in polar coordinates , so that @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we find that it now reads @xmath68\\right)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq:2.10}\\ ] ]    by means of illustration , let us consider a fixed angle @xmath69 , so that we can examine the electric field short distance behaviour . with these considerations , we find @xmath70\\simeq -\\frac{g}{2\\pi}\\left[\\frac{1}{r}-\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{4}r\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq:2.18}\\ ] ] hence , we see that the electric field @xmath71 at the sim@xmath0 mcs theory is still non - regular at the origin , as @xmath72 , due to the usual mcs part .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth of mention that the sim@xmath0vsr contribution already gives a well - behaved and regular contribution .",
    "we will observe further this positive consequence of vsr acting as a regulator of singular points when computing the interparticle potential ( see sec.[sec:3.2 ] ) .",
    "is of our interest to proceed and compute the total amount of energy stored in the electrostatic field of a pointlike charge , @xmath73 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be evaluated as usual @xmath74 .",
    "however , notice that the chern - simons contribution , @xmath75 , is already coordinate invariant @xcite , without additional metric factors ; so that the cs mass term does not contribute to @xmath76 ( as expected from a topological term ) .",
    "hence , we find in our case , that the energy - momentum tensor is simply given as @xmath77 so , in the electrostatic limit we find @xmath78 .",
    "thus , by using the solution we have that @xmath79\\right]\\right]^{2 } .\\ ] ] the angular integration can be computed by means of standard results , so that we get @xmath80\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced into the numerator a @xmath81 factor , as @xmath82 , so that we can compute the radial integration exactly . a straightforward computation of the remaining integration results into the following expression for the field energy @xmath83.\\label{eq:2.11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we thus find a regularized divergence in the first term of the field energy ; moreover , we clearly see that this divergent term is inherent from the usual mcs theory ( a similar fact is also present in the maxwell theory at @xmath7-dims . ) .",
    "so , in order to compare the field energy between the mcs and sim@xmath0vsr mcs theories , we shall consider only the finite contribution from the energy expression .",
    "first , for the vsr parameter @xmath84 , we find the usual mcs ( finite ) contribution @xmath85\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while , the sim@xmath0vsr ( finite ) contribution @xmath86 follows by taking @xmath87 in , i.e. @xmath88",
    ".    we can easily compute and find @xmath89 has one zero point in @xmath90 , while @xmath86 has one zero points in @xmath91 .",
    "so the vsr - modified mcs contribution has a shorter range of positivity than the usual mcs contribution .",
    "this is depicted in the figure [ fig1 ] .      in this last part of our analysis",
    "we will compute the vsr contribution for the static potential energy @xmath92 between pointlike sources .",
    "this study is well motivated since it is usually chosen to describe bound states of particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "moreover , we will show that the vsr - effects can be chosen conveniently so that the potential is well - behaved and regular . a suitable framework to compute the potential",
    "is found to be in terms of physical gauge - invariant objects @xcite .",
    "let us start by defining the vector gauge - invariant field by @xmath93 where the contour @xmath94 is chosen such as a spacelike path from the point @xmath95 and @xmath96 , on a fixed slice time . without loss of generality , we consider here a straight path @xmath97 parametrized by @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) ; besides , we can take by simplicity the fixed ( reference ) point to be @xmath100 .",
    "this construction for a gauge - invariant variable is , in fact , closely related to the poincar gauge conditions @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    within our interest",
    ", we can work out the expression under the above consideration , and after some manipulation , we find that its temporal component reads @xcite @xmath103    a remark is now in place .",
    "on one hand , the interaction energy @xmath92 of a quantum mechanical system is usually computed by means of a perturbative analysis , i.e. @xmath104 , where the complete hamiltonian is obtained by a canonical analysis following dirac s procedure . moreover , in this case one have dirac s gauge - invariant fermion  antifermion physical state @xmath105 . on the other hand ,",
    "instead , we may equally consider the gauge - invariant field in as to provide an equivalent but rather simple framework to compute the expression for the potential @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we can consider the scenario of a pair of static pointlike ( opposite ) charges , i.e. @xmath106 $ ] , where @xmath107 . in this case",
    ", the potential is then defined as @xmath108\\label{eq:3.7}\\ ] ] hence , in order to compute first the field @xmath109 from we take the electric field solution eq .. after some straightforward manipulation , we get the following expression @xmath110\\right)\\right]\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\frac{g}{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{mr}dwk_{1}\\left(w\\right)\\left[1+w^{2}\\left[a^{2}\\ln w - b^{2}\\right]\\right ] , \\label{eq:3.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made a change of variables @xmath111 and defined by simplicity @xmath112 .",
    "\\label{eq:3.12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integration in can be readily computed , and the complete expression for the gauge - invariant field reads @xmath113\\biggr ] .",
    "\\label{eq:3.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noticing the singular behaviour of @xmath114 on .",
    "since the expansion of @xmath115 for @xmath116 goes as @xmath117 , we thus see that the lower limit from the first term is not regular .",
    "this is indeed the case in the usual mcs theory , where such a term is usually disregarded .",
    "surprisingly , we see that the novel coefficient ( vsr dependent ) of this term can be chosen conveniently in such a way that this divergence is removed .",
    "hence , for the case when the identity for coefficient holds @xmath118 , it yields for @xmath119\\biggr]\\label{eq:3.4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    otherwise , we can conceive this choice for the coefficient as if we are taking the following value for the vsr parameter @xmath120 where we can think that such relation holds for a fixed value of @xmath121 . in this case",
    ", it also follows that @xmath122.\\label{eq:3.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides , the missing piece to evaluate the potential @xmath92 is obtained by taking the limit @xmath72 in , @xmath123 $ ] . finally , under the above considerations and by collecting the results and substituting them back into , we find for the potential the following result @xmath124\\bigg ] .",
    "\\label{eq:3.8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at last , we see that the vsr deformed expression shows a significant departure from the usual behaviour of the mcs theory , see figure [ fig2 ] . by means of illustration",
    ", we can consider the short distance regime of the potential , i.e. @xmath125 , this results into the simple ( confining ) expression @xmath126.\\label{3.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at first sight , this simplified expression might looks exactly the same as the one obtained in the usual mcs theory , since if we consider the short distance regime we have @xmath117 ( see for @xmath127 ) .",
    "however , notice two major differences : one , the vsr - modified potential is completely regular and finite under the condition @xmath118 , i.e. , we have removed the term @xmath128 ; second , the effective mass @xmath129 is shifted from the usual mcs parameter @xmath130 .",
    "at last , since the vsr deformed potential displays a confining behaviour at short distance ( i.e. @xmath131 as @xmath132 ) , it can used to describe stable bound states of particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "in this paper we have studied a vsr inspired modification of maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics . the analysis consisted in formulating a sim@xmath0vsr topologically electrodynamics , with the expectation that the nonlocal effects would contribute not only as massive contributions but rather in a significant way showing a distinct departure from the usual mcs theory .",
    "we started with a brief construction of the sim@xmath0 abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "hence , with a proper definition for the wiggle field strength we proposed a sim@xmath0vsr mcs theory . by adding an electrostatic source , we have determined the vsr - modified solution for the electric field .",
    "in particular , we showed that at short distances , although the usual mcs contribution is still singular , as @xmath133 , the vsr - effects give a finite contribution in this case .",
    "next , the electrostatic field energy has been computed , and was used in order to compare the vsr contributions in face of the usual mcs result . at last ,",
    "we have made use of the gauge - invariant formalism in order to compute the static potential between opposite charges .",
    "surprisingly , we found that vsr - effects contribute so that the usual ( mcs ) singular contribution for the potential can be suitably removed for a particular choice of the vsr parameter .",
    "hence , in addition to its regular form , the complete expression for the vsr modified ( confining ) potential shows a prominent and health departure from the mcs theory as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
