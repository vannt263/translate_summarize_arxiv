    "@xmath0 is a vector space @xmath1 together with a bilinear mapping @xmath2 satisfying the derivation form of the jacobi identity @xmath3 for all @xmath4 . every lie algebra is a leibniz algebra , but the bracket in a leibniz algebra need not be skew - symmetric .",
    "one of the outstanding problems in the theory of leibniz algebras is that of finding an appropriate generalization of lie s `` third theorem '' , which associates a ( local ) lie group to any ( real or complex ) lie algebra . the most challenging aspect of the problem is to determine what should be the correct generalization of the notion of group .",
    "so little is known about what properties these group - like objects should have that loday dubbed them  coquecigrues \" @xcite .",
    "the author and a. weinstein made an attempt to understand coquecigrues in @xcite by using smooth , nonassociative multiplications defined on reductive homogeneous spaces that are associated to leibniz algebras .",
    "however , as already discussed in that paper , the objects studied therein are not a satisfactory solution to the coquecigrue problem , because in the case where the given leibniz algebra is a lie algebra , the object associated to it in @xcite is not the lie group . at the very least , the correct generalization of lie s third theorem to leibniz algebras should reduce to the usual theorem for lie algebras ; that is , the coquecigrue of a lie algebra should be a lie group .",
    "this paper offers a different partial solution to the coquecigrue problem . by dissecting one of the proofs that the tangent space at the unit element of a lie group is a lie algebra",
    ", we find that the essential properties leading to the jacobi identity are not so much encoded in the group multiplication as they are in conjugation .",
    "this is hardly an original observation .",
    "for instance , recently it has been made in a categorical context by crans , who is interested in the similar problem of the relationship between lie @xmath5-groups and lie @xmath5-algebras @xcite . in any case , the observation that conjugation is what induces the jacobi identity leads us to consider _ lie racks _",
    ", that is , ( pointed ) manifolds with a smooth , left distributive binary operation .",
    "we propose that whatever the correct notion of coquecigrue might turn out to be , the leibniz algebra of a coquecigrue should be obtained from differentiating a lie rack structure associated to the coquecigrue .",
    "our primary example ( example [ ex : lie - rack ] ) of a nongroup lie rack is a product of a lie group and a vector space upon which the group acts ; we call these linear lie racks .",
    "the notion of lie rack itself might seem to be a reasonable candidate for coquecigrue , but this is premature , because it turns out that every leibniz algebra can be realized as the tangent leibniz algebra of some rack , but in the lie algebra case , the rack in question is not the conjugation rack of the lie group . however , there are other rack structures that are more promising , at least in the split case . in theorem",
    "[ thm : split - rack ] , we show that the leibniz algebra @xmath1 associated to a linear lie rack splits over its ideal @xmath6 generated by squares , that is , there exists a lie algebra @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , a direct sum of vector spaces . in this case , @xmath1 is the demisemidirect product of @xmath6 with @xmath9 in the sense of @xcite .",
    "conversely , if @xmath1 is a split leibniz algebra , then there exists a linear lie rack with @xmath1 as its tangent leibniz algebra .",
    "there are algebraic structures that are intermediate between racks and groups considered as racks .",
    "one such structure , which is suggested by the work of loday @xcite , is the notion of _ digroup_. we will give an axiomatic description of digroups in  4 , but essentially , they are sets @xmath10 with two binary operations @xmath11 and @xmath12 so that , in the jargon of semigroup theory @xcite , @xmath13 is a right group , @xmath14 is a left group , and there are some compatibility conditions ensuring that the sets of unit elements of the two structures coincide . using basic semigroup theory , we show that every digroup is a product of a group and a  trivial \" digroup .",
    "conjugation in groups generalizes to digroups so that every digroup has an associated rack structure . in the smooth case",
    ", then , every lie digroup @xmath10 ( that is , digroup in which @xmath11 and @xmath12 are smooth operations with respect to an underlying manifold structure ) has an associated leibniz algebra @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a distinguished unit element .",
    "the rack structure associated to a linear digroup is a linear lie rack , and conversely , every linear lie rack is induced by a linear digroup structure . as a corollary , we obtain lie s third theorem for split leibniz algebras : to each split leibniz algebra @xmath1 , there exists a lie digroup @xmath10 such that @xmath17 is a leibniz algebra isomorphic to @xmath1 .    within a span of a year , the notion of digroup discussed in this paper has been introduced independently three times .",
    "the first appearance of the definition and a discussion of basic properties seems to have been that of the author @xcite in a conference talk on 4 august 2004 .",
    "next appeared a preprint of k. liu @xcite , and then another by r. felipe @xcite . in each case , not only were the definitions of digroup nearly identical , but so was the choice of the term  digroup \" to denote the concept .",
    "this is not as surprising as it might seem : the definition of dimonoid ( which probably should have been called disemigroup ) and the ",
    "di- \" terminology are already contained in the work of j. loday @xcite .",
    "digroups are just dimonoids in which every element is invertible in an appropriate sense .",
    "thus one should really see the notion of digroup as being already implicit in loday s work .",
    "the observation that a digroup is a right group and a left group with a common set of unit elements seems to be new to this paper .",
    "additional recent papers on digroups and/or coquecigrues are @xcite , and liu has published a monograph @xcite , which also contains a wider notion of digroup than that studied here .",
    "worth mentioning is the interesting work of t. datuashvili @xcite , who has approached the coquecigrue problem from the point of view of generalizing the magnus - witt functor from the category of groups to the category of lie algebras .",
    "i would like to thank alan weinstein for introducing me to the problem of  integrating \" leibniz algebras .",
    "after witnessing @xcite , he made a couple of key remarks which greatly helped to simplify the presentation of the notion of digroup .",
    "he also made very useful comments on an early version of this paper .",
