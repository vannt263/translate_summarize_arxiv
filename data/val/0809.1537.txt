    "the simple , but nontrivial , geometry of the cone appears as an effective geometry in such diverse physical entities as cosmic strings @xcite , defects in elastic media @xcite , defects in liquid crystals @xcite and so on .",
    "accordingly , the dynamics of a quantum particle in a conical background has been profusely studied with very different motivations @xcite .",
    "an important issue concerning the cone is the fact that the conical background is naturally associated to a curvature singularity at the cone tip .",
    "the simplest way of dealing with this singularity is to impose the vanishing of the wavefunction at the cone tip as was done in @xcite .",
    "in fact , this is only one of the possible boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "a more general treatment can be done by use of the self - adjoint extension method @xcite .",
    "apparently this leads to a family of boundary conditions but , in fact , only the boundary condition corresponding to the actual physics of the problem should hold .",
    "this was done , for example , in @xcite .",
    "another problem that requires self - adjoint extension involves a potential which goes with the inverse squared distance .",
    "this pathological potential has deserved some attention recently ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) although it has been addressed already in 1950 by k. m. case @xcite .",
    "the main problem with this potential is that the energy levels are unbounded from below making the bound states unstable .",
    "different schemes of regularization have been used to approach this problem including radial cutoff @xcite or self - adjoint extension @xcite . in this article",
    ", we are interested in applying the self - adjoint extension approach to study the quantum dynamics of a neutral particle confined to a conical surface .",
    "as it will be seen below , besides the singularity at the cone tip , there is also a contribution from a inverse squared distance interaction .    when a quantum point particle moves confined to a surface embedded in ordinary 3-dimensional euclidean space , it is subjected to a geometric potential @xcite .",
    "it happens that , for the cone , part of this potential depends on the inverse squared distance from the cone tip .",
    "using polar coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we introduce the following line element @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "metric ( [ string1 ] ) describes a cone if @xmath6 .",
    "figure 1 shows the making of a cone from a planar sheet where an angular section was removed with posterior identification of the edges . if @xmath7 is the angle that defines the removed section then the remaining surface corresponds to an angular sector of @xmath8 .",
    "this is exactly what metric ( [ string1 ] ) describes .",
    "the incorporation of the term @xmath9 to the planar metric in polar coordinates makes the total angle on the surface be @xmath10 , since @xmath6 . by identification of the length of the circle without the sector , @xmath11 , with the length of the complete circle it turns out to be on the cone , @xmath12",
    ", we get the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the opening angle of the cone ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is clear then that @xmath15 tells how `` pointed '' is the cone .",
    "the closer @xmath15 gets to 1 ( or , equivalently , @xmath14 to @xmath16 ) the flatter is the cone . for @xmath17",
    "the cone turns into a plane . if @xmath18 , relation ( [ string1 ] ) still holds and the conical surface corresponds to the insertion of a sector ( _ i.e. _ @xmath19 ) .",
    "we call the resulting surface an anti - cone",
    ".    .,height=75 ]    notice that the line element ( [ string1 ] ) is just the @xmath20 , @xmath21 section of the metric of the cosmic string spacetime @xmath22 where , in this case , @xmath15 is related to the linear mass density @xmath23 of the string by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant and @xmath26 is the speed of light .",
    "usually , only @xmath27 is considered in cosmology , since @xmath18 corresponds to a negative mass density string . for the general case we are treating here we consider both possibilities .",
    "we will see that this has important consequences on the number of bound states .",
    "let us consider a neutral particle confined to a conical surface . as a consequence of the nontrivial topology of the cone and also",
    "because of two - dimensional confinement , the geometric potential should be taken into account @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean curvature and @xmath30 is the gaussian curvature of the surface . for the cone @xcite , @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0-function singularity in the gaussian curvature corresponds to the tip of the cone which , from now on , we refer to as `` defect '' because of its topological defect characteristics . also ,",
    "depending on @xmath15 , both curvatures will contribute with either attractive or repulsive potentials .    the neutral particle , with its motion confined to the conical surface ,",
    "is therefore subjected to a resultant potential given by @xmath33    real systems have finite radius defects meaning that the curvature singularity is smoothed across the defect diameter .",
    "therefore , let us consider a conical defect with a nucleus with radius @xmath34 which is small as compared to the overall dimension of the system .",
    "we replace the gaussian curvature contribution to the potential by a short - ranged potential supported inside the nucleus of the defect , that is , we have @xmath35 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the particle , in this case , is @xmath36\\psi+u_{short}(\\rho)\\psi = e\\psi,\\label{full}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 . here",
    ", @xmath30 turns into ( [ gauss1 ] ) in the limit @xmath38 .    following kay and studer @xcite",
    ", we solve this problem by modelling it by boundary conditions .",
    "we substitute the true problem above by @xmath39\\psi_{\\eta}=e\\psi_{\\eta},\\label{ideal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath40 labeled by a parameter @xmath41 which is related to the behavior of the wavefunction in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "but we can not impose any boundary condition ( _ e.g. _ @xmath43 at @xmath44 ) without discovering which boundary conditions are allowed to equation ( [ ideal ] ) .",
    "this is the scope of the self - adjoint extension @xcite .",
    "we finish this section by remarking that the problem of a dipole in a conical background is qualitatively the same since the conical topology introduces a self - interaction which goes with the inverse squared distance to the cone vertex @xcite . moreover , the dependence of this self - interaction on the cone opening angle is the same as the one that appears in the mean curvature contribution to the geometric potential . for these reasons",
    ", our results also shade some light onto the dipole problem @xcite .",
    "in order to proceed to the self - adjoint extension of ( [ ideal ] ) , we use the tensorial decomposition @xmath45 . as we can see in @xcite , the operator @xmath46 is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath47 .",
    "then , putting the wave function in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 ... is the angular momentum quantum number , we arrive at the modified bessel equation @xmath50\\phi_{\\eta}=0 ,   \\label{dipocone}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , since we are looking for bound states , and with @xmath52 notice that @xmath18 implies @xmath53 for all allowed values of @xmath54 . on the other hand , when @xmath27 we have @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath53 for @xmath57 ... there is no choice of @xmath54 that will give @xmath58 , except @xmath56 , but then @xmath15 would have to be @xmath59 ( flat space ) .",
    "now , to find the full domain of @xmath60 in @xmath61 , we have to find the deficient subspace of ( [ dipocone ] ) .",
    "to do this , we have to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath62 where @xmath63 $ ] comes from equation ( [ dipocone ] ) , for each case : @xmath55 and @xmath53 .",
    "the only square integrable functions which are solutions to equation ( [ eigen ] ) are the modified bessel functions @xmath64 such that @xmath65 where @xmath66 if @xmath53 or @xmath67 if @xmath55 .",
    "the dimension of such deficient space is @xmath68 . because of this",
    ", the domain of ( [ dipocone ] ) in @xmath69 is given by the set of functions @xmath70,\\label{domain}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , is the wavefunction when we do not have @xmath73 .",
    "the last term in ( [ domain ] ) gives the correct behavior of the wavefunction when @xmath74 .",
    "the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent the _ a priori _ choices of boundary conditions .",
    "as we shall see below , the physics of the problem determines these parameters without ambiguity .",
    "in fact , @xmath76 cancels out of the calculations such that we only have to determine @xmath41 , which describes the coupling between @xmath73 and the wavefunction .",
    "then it must be expressed in terms of @xmath15 , the defect core radius @xmath34 and the effective angular momentum @xmath77 .",
    "the next step is to find a fitting to @xmath41 compatible with @xmath73 .",
    "we shall do this in the next two sections for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 cases , respectively .",
    "there is only one possibility here , which is @xmath56 and @xmath27 .",
    "now , @xmath80 is the effective potential that includes the centripetal term and the contribution from the mean curvature .",
    "the contribution from the gaussian curvature to the potential is @xmath81 then , in this case , @xmath82 and therefore attractive ; @xmath83 , repulsive . we will see below that , even with this very short range repulsion , the attractive @xmath84 potential guarantees a bound state .    in this section",
    "we find a fitting formula for @xmath41 following the procedure described by kay and studer @xcite .",
    "first , we write ( [ full ] ) , the true problem , for @xmath85 , the @xmath86 or static solution : @xmath87+u_{short}(\\rho)\\right\\}\\phi_{static}^{true}=0   \\label{statictrue}\\ ] ]    since we are considering the defect core radius @xmath34 , the gaussian curvature ( [ gauss1 ] ) must be written as @xmath88 where the constant @xmath89 was inserted for convenience - for the case we are studying it is in fact 1 , but if we make @xmath90 we are choosing the boundary condition @xmath91 .",
    "then , we require that @xmath92 where @xmath93 comes from ( [ domain ] ) . for @xmath79 the wavefunctions ( [ domain ] )",
    "are given in terms of @xmath94 , the modified bessel function @xcite of purely imaginary order .",
    "since @xmath95 we use the expansion for small @xmath96 , @xmath97\\left[1+o(x^2)\\right]\\label{nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "now , taking into account ( [ domain ] ) , we arrive at @xmath98 where @xmath99 + e^{i\\eta}\\sin\\left[\\nu   \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{+2mik_{0}}\\rho/2\\hbar\\right)+\\nu\\gamma\\right ] \\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath100 .",
    "now , integrating ( [ statictrue ] ) from @xmath101 to @xmath34 we have @xmath102 considering that @xmath103 we have @xmath104 so , from ( [ fit ] ) , ( [ derivadaleft ] ) and ( [ derivadaright ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath105 which gives us the parameter @xmath41 in terms of the physics of the problem , that is , the correct behavior of the wave functions when @xmath42 , or the coupling between the short - ranged potential @xmath106 and the wavefunctions .",
    "next , we will find the bound states of the hamiltonian and we will see that the formula ( [ firstfit ] ) gives us the spectrum without any arbitrary parameter . for that , we must solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath107\\phi_{e}=-e\\phi_{e } , \\label{eigenvalue}\\ ] ] whose general solution is given by @xmath108 since this solution belongs to the domain of the hamiltonian that appears in equation ( [ dipocone ] ) , it is of the form ( [ domain ] ) , that is , @xmath109.\\label{domain2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the expressions ( [ domain2 ] ) and ( [ nu ] ) , we arrive at @xmath110\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath111.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the above expressions for @xmath112 and @xmath113 in ( [ firstfit ] ) we get @xmath114=\\lambda\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)-\\frac{\\nu^{2}}{2}. \\label{cot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath115 , the inversion of equation ( [ cot ] ) yields @xmath116.\\label{novel}\\ ] ]    notice that the case studied in this section , @xmath55 , corresponds to @xmath27 .",
    "this means that , while the mean curvature contributes attractively , the gaussian curvature contributes with a repulsive short - ranged potential .",
    "equation ( [ nu2 ] ) implies that the only allowable value for the angular momentum is @xmath56 , meaning that we have a single bound state .",
    "if we make @xmath90 in equation ( [ cot ] ) we obtain the result of reference @xcite : @xmath117\\label{moraes},\\ ] ] with @xmath118 , which corresponds to imposing the condition that the wavefunction vanishes at @xmath74 , or an infinitely high barrier there .",
    "here , we have two possibilities :    * @xmath27 and @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 , @xmath83 * @xmath18 and @xmath122 @xmath120 @xmath121 , @xmath123    in the first case , even though the contribution from the mean curvature to @xmath124 is attractive , @xmath124 itself is not , then there are no bound states . in the second case , the attractive @xmath0-function potential guarantees one bound state for specific values of @xmath54 , as it will be seen below .    in this case equation ( [ statictrue ] ) is written as @xmath125+u_{short}(\\rho)\\right\\}\\phi_{static}^{true}=0 .",
    "\\label{xinegative}\\ ] ] then , solving equation ( [ eigen ] ) , we arrive at the set of functions @xmath126.\\label{domainxi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these functions are square integrable only in the range @xmath127 but , since we can not have @xmath58 , we are restricted to @xmath128 .    now , following the procedure for the case @xmath78 above , and taking into account that @xcite , for @xmath129 , @xmath130\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath131 , we find the energy spectrum to be @xmath132^{1/\\left|\\nu\\right|}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dependence of the bound states on the angular momentum @xmath54 is analyzed below .",
    "in the case studied in this section we have two constraints : @xmath128 and @xmath18 .",
    "the first one , combined with equation ( [ nu2 ] ) , implies that @xmath133 the inequality on the left hand side is always obeyed since @xmath18 .",
    "the right hand side inequality gives us the maximum value of @xmath54 for each value of @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , we have bound states for + @xmath134 and so on .",
    "notice that the case studied in this section , @xmath53 , corresponds to the quantum problem in the anti - cone ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this makes the mean curvature potential repulsive and the short - ranged potential , due to the gaussian curvature , attractive .",
    "therefore , the gaussian curvature is the sole responsible for the bound states .",
    "notice also that , the arbitrary boundary condition , @xmath43 at @xmath44 , used for example in references @xcite , is not allowed since @xmath135 is not regular there . in other words , if this boundary condition is used there are no bound states for @xmath18 .",
    "many authors have discussed separately the quantum dynamics of a particle in the presence of spacial singularities or else , ill - behaved potentials , like the inverse squared distance potential and the @xmath0-function potential . in a single toy model we study these anomalous conditions in a unified way which clarifies the meaning of the boundary conditions usually taken for granted in such problems , like imposing that the wavefunction vanishes at the origin , for example .",
    "in fact , this imposition is quite arbitrary .",
    "the self - adjoint extension introduces a natural way of finding the appropriate boundary condition which describes the physics of short - ranged potentials .",
    "a common interpretation @xcite of the self - adjoint extension is that it gives a family of solutions associated to a certain freedom on choosing the boundary conditions .",
    "however , by considering a finite - sized defect and shrinking its radius to zero we fixed the boundary condition , as done in @xcite .",
    "our toy model consists in a neutral particle in a two - dimensional conical surface .",
    "the conical geometry introduces an inverse squared distance potential due to the mean curvature which can be either attractive or repulsive , depending on the cone parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the conical geometry is also responsible for a @xmath0-function interaction which , again , can either be attractive or repulsive , depending on the cone parameter @xmath15 .",
    "table i reveals that , even in the case of a repulsive effective potential ( @xmath18 ) , the attractive short - ranged potential guarantees bound states for the values of the angular momentum specified in ( 40 ) .",
    "conversely , when the short - ranged potential is repulsive ( @xmath27 ) an attractive effective potential potential assures one bound state ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "and , when @xmath27 , for @xmath136 , we have both @xmath124 and @xmath137 repulsive , giving no bound states .",
    "since our schrdinger equation is singular at @xmath74 we solved the problem paying attention to the correct behavior of the wavefunction there . using the self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian operator",
    "this behavior appears naturally , but we had to fit the extension parameter in terms of the known physics of the system when @xmath138 .",
    "this procedure gave us exact analytical expressions for the energy levels .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the `` usual '' boundary condition @xmath43 at @xmath74 , which corresponds to an infinite barrier there , gives bound states only for the case @xmath18 , or the anti - cone .    without using the self - adjoint extension we can follow the usual way to deal with delta - potentials",
    "( see for example @xcite ) . however , the self - adjoint extension approach is a more direct procedure to find the physics compatible with short - ranged potentials .",
    "the reader can compare , for example , the aharonov - bohm - coulomb problem discussed by hagen and park @xcite and by park and oh @xcite .",
    "the same non - relativistic spectrum was achieved in both articles but with much less work in the second , where the self - adjoint extension was used .",
    "another example of the importance of the method is given in reference @xcite where we studied the gravitational bound - state aharonov - bohm effect due to a cosmic string .",
    "this effect was initially @xcite predicted for the hypothetical case of a cosmic string surrounded by a cylindrical wall . by using the correct boundary condition , as given by the self - adjoint extension",
    ", we were able to show in @xcite that the effect is still there without the need of the wall .",
    "in summary , the self - adjoint extension approach is a powerfull method if we are interested in the quantum dynamics of particles in spaces with singularities .",
