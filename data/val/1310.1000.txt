    "recent progress in the growth of chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) diamonds is challenging readout electronics developers . because of its large bandgap of 5.5 ev and very low boron and nitrogen impurity concentrations @xmath01 - 5 ppb  @xcite cvd diamond has a negligible intrinsic noise at room temperature .",
    "in fact , the mean leakage current of a typical device is less than 1 pa . combining this with a very high carrier mobility of about @xmath1c/(v/@xmath2 m ) , allowing for a complete charge collection in few ns ( 8 ns for 500 @xmath2 m thick device biased at 1 v/@xmath2 m ) , results in an intrinsic noise charge collected within the duration of the signal of the order of @xmath30.05 electrons . except for very slow , cryogenic , charge sensitive amplifiers , able to reduce the rms noise to a few electrons ,",
    "such precision is out of reach of modern fast amplifiers .",
    "indeed , the best broadband amplifiers have input referred noise rms of @xmath4 electrons corresponding to the input referred noise of 10 @xmath2v ( 50 @xmath5 input impedance ) in 8 ns signal . even conventional charge amplifiers with 50 - 300 @xmath2s decay time have more than 200 electrons rms noise . therefore , for diamond detector applications",
    "the dominant ( by three - five orders of magnitude ) source of noise is the readout electronics .    in the present note we present a series of tests on various fast amplifiers aimed to identify the best solution for nuclear and particle physics applications .",
    "these applications demand a measurement of both the energy released in the bulk of the diamond by ionizing particles and the time .",
    "these tests were performed using various radioactive sources .",
    "we selected a 4.7 x 4.7mm2 , 500 um thick single crystal cvd diamond detector capacitance can be estimated according to the plain    we selected 4.7@xmath64.7 mm@xmath7 , 500 @xmath2 m thick single crystal cvd diamond detector produced by diamond detectors ltd  @xcite .",
    "the crystal has two electrodes deposited on its upper and lower major surfaces , made of few nm of dlc followed by 100 nm of gold .",
    "each contact is bonded via a gold microwire onto pcb and then to its sma connector in such a way that both contacts can be read out independently .",
    "detector capacitance can be estimated according to the plane capacitor equation ( neglecting eventual fringe field contribution ) : @xmath8 this result is in good agreement with the value measured by hp 4280a capacimeter .",
    "the diamond detector was polarized at 1 v/@xmath2 m by means of ortec 710 bias supply .",
    "this value remains below detector breakdown voltage ( at 1.4 v/@xmath2 m discharges , likely to be attributed to crystal defects or contact disuniformity , occur ) allowing for complete charge collection  @xcite .    in the present work , we used two types of readout : one - side readout , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_single ] and two - side readout , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_double ] .",
    "the one - side readout was used to characterize energy resolution of of various amplifiers . in this case",
    "the diamond was polarized by applying 1 v/@xmath2 m bias voltage from the readout side and the other contact was connected to ground .",
    "schematic drawing of the experimental setup in case of the one - side readout . ]",
    "schematic drawing of the experimental setup in case of the two - side readout . ]",
    "the two - side readout was used to study ideal timing resolution of the cvd diamond detector .",
    "indeed , the major contribution to both energy and timing resolutions come from the readout electronics and in particular from the first amplification stage . using the same diamond detector signal",
    "read out independently from opposite sides by two separate amplifiers allows to study the electronic contribution to the timing resolution using realistic signals .    for single amplifier characterization measurements",
    "the diamond detector was connected to the amplifier input through a 2.4 cm huber & suhner sma `` i '' connector , while the second sma connector of the detector was shorted to ground by sma tap .",
    "the overall capacitance of the system in front of the amplifier ( `` i '' connector , two sma connectors of detector case and sma tap ) was found to be 6.6 pf .",
    "the amplifier output was connected to the digitizer via 1.5 m huber & suhner sucoflex 104 cable .",
    "the amplified signal was read out by sis3305 digitizer with analog bandwidth of 2.2 ghz .",
    "the digitizer was operated in four - channel interleaved 5 gs / s mode .",
    "for timing response measurements with small signals an additional amplifier philips scientific 744 with bandwidth of 1.8 ghz and gain @xmath9 was inserted between primary amplifier output and digitizer input .",
    "the data measured by the digitizer was acquired through the vme bus by concurrent technologies vx 813/091 single board computer ( sbc ) which incorporates a tsi148 vme controller .",
    "a simple daq program was developed using dma transfer of digitizer memory to the sbc memory .",
    "the data were saved on the local compact flash disk and transferred to workstation for the off - line analysis .",
    "in order to measure coincidence events and to reduce accessible energy threshold the standard sis3305 digitizer firmware rev.1c.0b had to be modified .",
    "sis3305 digitizer features three xilinx fpgas on - board , two virtex 5 fpgas serve as interfaces for the two 2.5 gs / s adc cores , and one virtex 4 fpga manages the board vme interface .",
    "partially precompiled firmware of adc fpgas was acquired from the manufacturer for our purposes .",
    "this firmware version 1c.0b included only simple internal triggers : data acquisition is started when one adc sample goes above or below imposed threshold in one of digitizer channels .",
    "it also includes a schmidt trigger , which fires when one adc sample goes above ( below ) a first threshold and turns off when after another single adc sample is below ( above ) a second threshold .",
    "the trigger was modified using the xilinx ise design suite version 13.2 .",
    "first of all a trigger that fires when a configurable number of samples is above ( below ) a given threshold was implemented . for the initialization of this parameter for each channel we used bits 30 - 26 of the corresponding sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 and sis3305_trigger_gate_lt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 ( 0x2020 - 0x203c and 0x3020 - 0x303c ) registers  @xcite .",
    "this allows to select the number of consecutive samples above / below threshold in selected channel in the range from 1 to 32 ( 5-bit word ) corresponding to time interval from 0.8 ns to 25.6 ns .",
    "the 4.8 ns long channel s trigger - valid signal goes on when the number of consecutive samples above / below threshold in given channel reaches the configured value . in case of the 2 or 4 channel interleaved modes ( 2.5 gs / s and 5 gs / s ,",
    "respectively ) an asynchronous and of the corresponding channel trigger - valid signals is taken and then synchronized with 250 mhz system clock to give the final adc core internal trigger .",
    "the acquisition mode is determined by the first three bits of sis3305_event_config_adc1_4 ( 0x2000 ) or sis3305_event_config_adc5_8 ( 0x3000 ) register . in this way",
    "the real number of samples above / below threshold in 2 or 4 channel interleaved modes is equal to the configured value multiplied by 2 or 4 , respectively .",
    "the adc core internal trigger signal can be extended from its natural length of 4 ns up to 128 ns by configuring bits 14 - 10 of sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 ( 0x2020 ) register .",
    "this 5-bit word allows to modify the coincidence time window with precision of 4 ns .",
    "it has to be mentioned that since many firmware blocks were provided in a precompiled form we had to follow its existing design .",
    "in particular , the data from each adc input channel acquired at 1.25 gs / s rate are split in adc - fpga in six parallel 208.3 mhz flows .",
    "this architecture limits the trigger selectivity in the 2 or 4 channel interleaved modes .",
    "indeed , the length of trigger - valid signal from each adc channel is 4.8 ns , therefore imposing only one sample above / below threshold in one of interleaved modes ( 2 or 4 channels ) there is a probability to trigger on accidental coincidence of background hits ( whose rate @xmath10 ) in selected channels within @xmath11 ns time window of @xmath12 ) . in order to prevent this possible background the continuity of trigger condition among interleaved channels",
    "can be activated by an additional configuration flag .",
    "setting bit-15 of sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 ( 0x2020 ) register the difference between indexes of trigger samples within 6-sample data blocks from interleaved adc channels is checked to be not larger than unity .",
    "the coincidence between two adc cores ( channels 1 - 4 and 5 - 8 ) is implemented in the vme - fpga by an asynchronous and between two adc core internal trigger signals , then synchronized with 125 mhz system clock and extended to 32 ns length . setting bit-20 of sis3305_trigger_out_select_reg ( 0x40 ) register allows to route the coincidence signal onto a lemo trigger out connector . thus connecting the latter to the lemo trigger in connector and enabling the external lemo trigger in bit in sis3305_control_status ( 0x0 )",
    "register and external trigger bit in sis3305_event_config_adc1_4/5_8 ( 0x2000 and 0x3000 ) register allows to measure coincidence events only .",
    "the coincidence interval can be configured with 4 ns steps up to 128 ns as explained above .",
    "similarly , bit-21 of sis3305_trigger_out_select_reg ( 0x40 ) register allows to trigger on or of two adc core internal triggers .",
    "this feature permits to acquire both adcs when one of two adc cores had an internal trigger .",
    "it has to be noticed that in this modified firmware the schmidt trigger has been removed and therefore trigger - off setting in bits 25 - 16 of sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 and sis3305_trigger_gate_lt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 registers ( 0x2020 - 0x203c and 0x3020 - 0x303c ) are not more significant .",
    "moreover , the internal trigger logic in the 2 channel interleaved mode ( 2.5 gs / s ) assumes that two pairs of channels are : 1 and 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "this modified firmware is available at  @xcite .",
    "the noise level referred to the input was measured simultaneously with signal acquisition by comparing the voltages in the samples before the signal peak to the baseline voltage .",
    "this was done for the full digitizer sampling rate of 5 gs / s and summing four interleaved channel amplitudes to restrict the sampling rate to 1.25 gs / s ( sis3305 digitizer analog bandwidth is 2.2 ghz ) .",
    "the resulted distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_distr ] and their rms values are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_rms ] .",

    "in many experiments the amplifier can not be installed close to the detector .",
    "insertion of a cable between detector and the amplifier introduces noise and signal distortions , in particular when the impedance of the cable and amplifier is not well matched .",
    "this is particularly important for charge and transimpedance amplifiers .",
    "standard broadband amplifiers featuring 50 @xmath5 input impedance are almost insensitive to the insertion of the input cable . in our application",
    "the presence of a @xmath131.5 m long cable is mandatory .",
    "hence we tested transimpedance and charge amplifiers cividec c6 and cividec cx with four different cables : 150 cm of 50 @xmath5/87 pf / m sf105 ( indicated as rg58 ) , 150 cm of 75 @xmath5/67 pf / m rg59 , 166 cm of 93 @xmath5/44 pf / m rg62 , 616 cm of 185 @xmath5/22.3 pf / m rg114 .",
    "the comparison of signals produced by cividec c6 and cividec cx amplifiers connected to the detector via different cables is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cable_distortion ] .",
    "distortion of the signal from diamond detector introduced by insertion of various cables between detector and cividec c6 transimpedance amplifier ( left ) and cividec cx charge amplifier ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   distortion of the signal from diamond detector introduced by insertion of various cables between detector and cividec c6 transimpedance amplifier ( left ) and cividec cx charge amplifier ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    using the cividec c6 amplifier , the insertion of a cable leads to strong signal reflections , reducing for higher impedance cables and almost absent for 185 @xmath5 rg114 cable . from this",
    "we deduce that the amplifier input impedance is about 200 @xmath5 .",
    "using cividec cx amplifier cable insertion leads to signal suppression proportional to the overall capacitance of the cable .",
    "indeed , the rg62 cable with 44 pf / m capacitance shows smallest suppression , while rg114 with 22.3 pf / m capacitance exhibits larger suppression because its 4 times larger length . this can be better quantified by measuring peak amplitude of the output signals as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : cable_resolution ] .",
    "cividec c6 amplifier energy resolution changes by about 10% with rg114 and rg62 cables , while no effect is observed for other cables . for cividec cx amplifier insertion of any cable leads to 30 - 40% resolution loss .",

    "a number of modern commercial amplifiers for diamond detectors were characterized for typical nuclear and particle physics applications . these include four broadband amplifiers one transimpedance amplifier and one charge amplifier .",
    "we compared their energy and timing resolutions in order to select the best candidate for measuring 200 kev deposited energy signals . among these amplifiers",
    "only cividec c6 and cividec cx amplifiers are able to reach energy thresholds as low as 100 kev",
    ". however , the latter one is charge amplifier featuring very long signals , not suitable for for timing application . the obtained timing resolution at 200 kev of the only amplifier which met our requirements , the cividec c6 , was found to be 1.2 ns ( resolution of two cividec c6 amplifiers in coincidence ) , which was factor of 6 larger than our target resolution of 200 ps .",
    "this resolution could be further reduced by a factor @xmath14 by differential readout of the detector , but would remain factor of 4 above the requirement .",
