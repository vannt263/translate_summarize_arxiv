    "the structure of the solar corona out to a few solar radii is dominated by the magnetic field .",
    "knowledge regarding the coronal magnetic field is therefore important to understand physical processes like flares and coronal mass ejections .",
    "unfortunately direct measurements of the magnetic field are difficult for the following reasons : the high plasma temperature in the corona broadens the line profile orders of magnitudes above the zeeman splitting .",
    "in addition coronal lines are optical thin and consequently the line - of - sight integrated character of the measurements complicates their interpretation .    it has been proposed to use magnetic sensitive coronal line observations in order to constrain the coronal magnetic field ( see , e.g. , , ) . demonstrated that zeeman - effect measurements can be performed . however , due to the line - of - sight effect the interpretation of these lines is difficult . also , recent measurements of chromospheric and lower coronal magnetic fields were made for a few individual cases , e.g. @xcite .",
    "such multi - wavelength spectropolarimetric observations have not been done routinely in the past but are believed to become much more commonplace , and reliable , in the near future .    as an alternative to these direct measurements",
    ", methods have been developed to use the magnetic field observed on the photosphere for an extrapolation into the corona .",
    "the extrapolation is not free from assumptions regarding the coronal plasma .",
    "it is helpful , that the low and middle corona contains a low @xmath0 plasma which allows to neglect the plasma pressure in first order and use a force - free magnetic field model .",
    "a force - free magnetic field is characterized by the electric currents parallel to the magnetic field lines , i.e. , @xmath1 where the coefficient @xmath2 is constant along the field lines but may vary between different field lines . since ( [ curlb = ab ] ) due to its intrinsic non - linearity",
    "is difficult to solve , simplifications of ( [ curlb = ab ] ) are sometimes used like potential fields ( @xmath2 = 0 , i.e. , no currents ; see e.g. @xcite ) and linear force - free fields ( @xmath2 = const ; see e.g. ) .",
    "the non - linear force - free case is challenging both theoretically due to the non - linearity of the underlying mathematical problem and observationally because a measurement of the full magnetic vector on the photospheric is required . for investigations of instabilities like filament eruptions",
    ", it is essential to consider the general non - linear force - free field case , because with the simplified field models mentioned above the free magnetic energy which might drive the instability can not be described    moreover , a comparison between extrapolations and measured fields @xcite in a newly developed active region revealed that a non - linear model agrees better with the observations than a potential and linear force - free magnetic field model @xcite .",
    "a non - linear force - free extrapolation of coronal magnetic fields from measured photospheric data is a challenging problem for several reasons .",
    "the magnetic field in the photosphere is not necessary force - free ( see ) and one would rather prefer to use the vector - magnetic field at the basic of the corona as boundary condition for a non - linear force - free extrapolation , but here measurements are usually not available .    another problem is the @xmath3 ambiguity in the transversal components of the photospheric data , which has to be removed with e.g. the minimum energy method @xcite .",
    "an additional complication is that the transversal components are more difficult to measure and bear much more noise than the line - of - sight component . for the data of the solar - flare telescope ( sft ) used in section [ sec5 ] , for example , the noise level is about @xmath4 for the line - of - sight magnetic field and @xmath5 for the transverse field .",
    "the full disk vector magnetograph solis ( synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun , u.s",
    ". national solar observatory , kitt peak ) is expected to have a noise level of about @xmath6 in the line - of - sight and about @xmath7 in the transverse components ( c. keller , private communication ) .",
    "the reason for the much higher noise in the transversal magnetic field @xmath8 compared with the line - of - sight field ( @xmath9 ) can be understood by the way how the photospheric magnetic field is derived from the four measured stokes components .",
    "roughly @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the circular polarization and @xmath12 is a constant .",
    "then @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the noise in @xmath15 .",
    "this photon noise is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "even if the @xmath16 and @xmath17 signals are generally weaker than the @xmath11 signal , the major source of errors in the force balance is the noise in @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are linear polarization intensities and @xmath20 is another constant .",
    "then @xmath21 as a consequence the transvers magnetic field noise is in particular high in weak field regions . in strong field regions vector",
    "magnetic field measurements based on full stokes spectro - polarimetry generally yield uncertainties of a few degrees in the orientation angles of the field vector in active regions .",
    "this situation is also constantly improving with improved instrumentation .",
    "for the practical computation of the coronal magnetic field it is also helpful if the boundary data are smoothed to some degree .",
    "short wavelength fluctuations in the surface magnetic field die out rapidly with height ( for a potential field with @xmath22 for scales of horizontal wavenumber @xmath23 ) .",
    "hence , boundary data with scales much finer than the height of the numerical box require a very fine grid to be sufficiently resolved but they hardly have a effect on the result , except in a very small boundary layer above the surface . to keep the numerical effort limited ,",
    "the boundary data are therefore usually smoothed . in this context",
    "it should also be noted that the force - free equation ( [ curlb = ab ] ) is scale invariant if @xmath2 is rescaled appropriately .",
    "hence , by smoothing of the boundary data we do not lose any physics which we have not already cast away by the restriction to a stationary force - free field model .",
    "a more fundamental requirement on the boundary data is its consistency with the force - free field approximation .",
    "as has been shown by , a balance of the total momentum and angular momentum exerted onto the numerical box by the magnetic field leads to a set of boundary integral constraints for the magnetic field .",
    "these constraints should also be satisfied on the solar surface for the field at the coronal base in the vicinity of a sufficiently isolated magnetic region and in a situation where there is no rapid dynamical development .    in summary , the boundary data for the force - free extrapolation should fulfill the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the data should coincide with the photospheric observations within measurement errors .",
    "the data should be consistent with the assumption of a force - free magnetic field above .",
    "3 .   for computational reasons ( finite differences ) the data should be sufficiently smooth .    within this work",
    "we describe a numerical procedure , written in idl , which pre - processes vector magnetograph data so that the above conditions are satisfied as close as possible .",
    "we outline the paper as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we specify how to check if a given measured vector magnetograms is consistent with the assumption of a force - free magnetic field above .",
    "we describe , how to derive consistent force - free boundary conditions for a force - free magnetic field extrapolation from the measured data in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we use a known semi - analytic force - free model to check our method and we apply the method in section [ sec5 ] to an example of the observed vector magnetogram .",
    "in the following we assume that the @xmath24 ambiguity in the measured transverse components has been removed and the magnetogram has been observed close to the disk center .",
    "`` close '' here means that the vertical component @xmath25 in our numerical box can be more or less identified with the line - of - sight component and bears a smaller measurement error than the horizontal components @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "since , as stated above , the measurement error between the line - of - sight and the transverse components differs by about one order of magnitude , the angle between line - of - sight and vertical should not exceed @xmath28 0.1 radian .",
    "another a - priori assumption about the photospheric data is that the magnetic flux from the photosphere is sufficiently distant from the boundaries of the observational domain and the net flux is in balance , i.e. , @xmath29 generally , the flux balance criterion has to be applied to the whole , closed surface of the numerical box .",
    "however , we can only measure the magnetic field vector on the bottom photospheric boundary and the contributions of the lateral and top boundary remain unspecified . however , if a major part of the known flux from the bottom boundary is uncompensated , the final force - free magnetic field solution will markedly depend on how the uncompensated flux is distributed over the other five boundaries .",
    "this would result in a major uncertainty of the final force free magnetic field configuration .",
    "we therefore demand the flux balance to be satisfied with the bottom data alone .",
    "if this is not the case , we classify the reconstruction problem as not uniquely solvable within the given box .    used the virial theorem to define which conditions a vector magnetogram has to fulfill to be consistent with the assumption of a force - free field above .",
    "we repeat here the force - free and torque - free condition and refer to the paper of @xcite for details .    1",
    ".   the total force on the boundary vanishes @xmath30 @xmath31 2 .",
    "the total torque on the boundary vanishes @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    note that if condition 1 ) is fulfilled , the constraints 2 ) are independent on where the origin for @xmath35 is located . in our code",
    "the origin is usually at the lower left corner of the bottom boundary face .    as with the flux balance ,",
    "the aly integral criteria in general have to be applied to the whole surface of the numerical box .",
    "since we assumed that the photospheric flux is sufficiently concentrated in the center and the net flux is in balance , we can expect the magnetic field on the lateral and top boundary to remain small and hence these surfaces will not yield a large contribution to the integrals of the aly - constraints above .",
    "we therefore impose the aly - criteria on the bottom boundary alone",
    ".    already pointed out that the magnetic field is probably not force - free in the measured region because the plasma @xmath0 in the photosphere is of the order of one and pressure and gravity forces are not negligible .",
    "we however expect that the observed photospheric field is , after removing scales below a super - granular diameter by smoothing , representative for the field at the coronal base . in the corona , however we have @xmath36 and consequently the magnetic field should be close to force - free in a stationary situation .    to quantify the quality of vector magnetograms with respect to the above criteria we introduce three dimensionless parameters :    1 .",
    "the flux balance parameter @xmath37 2 .",
    "the force balance parameter @xmath38 + @xmath39 3 .",
    "the torque balance parameter @xmath40 + @xmath41    an observed vector magnetogram is then flux - balanced and consistent with the force - free assumption if : @xmath42 .",
    "even if we choose a sufficiently flux balanced isolated active region @xmath43 we find that usually the force - free conditions @xmath44 are not fulfilled for measured vector magnetograms .",
    "we conclude therefore , that non - linear force - free extrapolation methods may not be used directly on observed vector magnetograms , in particular not on the very noisy transverse photospheric magnetic field measurements .",
    "the large noise in the transverse components of the photospheric field vector ( @xmath45 the horizontal @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the bottom boundary ) gives us the freedom to adjust these data within the noise level .",
    "we use this freedom to drive the data towards being more consistent with aly s force - free and torque - free conditions .    as a measure",
    ", how well a photospheric magnetic field agrees with aly s criteria , the observed data and the smoothness condition , we define the following functional which adds up the chi - square deviations from all individual constraints : @xmath46 where @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ % torque l_2 & = & \\left [ \\left(\\sum_p x   \\left(b_z^2-b_x^2-b_y^2 \\right ) \\right)^2                + \\left(\\sum_p y   \\left(b_z^2-b_x^2-b_y^2 \\right ) \\right)^2          \\right .",
