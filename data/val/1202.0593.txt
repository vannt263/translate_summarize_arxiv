    "stokes parameters are used to characterize the polarization state of light : the stokes i parameter tells us about the intensity , q and u about the linear polarization and v about the circular polarization @xcite .",
    "the variation of these parameters across a spectral line are called stokes profiles . when the light beam comes from a static atmosphere , the stokes i , q and u profiles are symmetric functions , and stokes v is antisymmetric showing two lobes of opposite signs with respect to the central wavelength .",
    "however , the stokes v signals coming from the solar atmosphere rarely are purely antisymmetric , i.e. , the two lobes are different either in shape , in amplitude or in area . the asymmetry of the stokes v is generally described in terms of the difference between the amplitudes ( or the areas ) of each lobe normalized to their sum .",
    "the asymmetry in the stokes v profile requires a velocity gradients in the atmosphere where the radiation is coming from ( @xcite among others ) . in case of extreme asymmetries , one of the lobes of stokes v is missing .",
    "these are referred as single - lobed stokes v profiles .",
    "such large asymmetries can not be explained with a velocity gradient alone , and require gradients of the magnetic field vector .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the single - lobed stokes v profiles observed in the quiet sun .",
    "these profiles show only one lobe , or two lobes with one reduced by a very large extent .",
    "profiles of this type were first described by @xcite and studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former author studied the amount of blue - only and red - only single - lobed stokes v profiles in the quiet sun .",
    "@xcite observed a ratio of blue - only to red only profiles of 4:1 .",
    "he associated the blue - only profiles with magnetic structures exhibiting downflows whereas the red - only profiles seemed to be related to upflows .",
    "he used a large scan area , so he could not observed the temporal evolution of these signals . therefore , although he proposed several scenarios , he could not explain the phenomena behind them .    to explain the existence of stokes v profiles with strong asymmetry several theoretical models featuring large gradients in velocity and magnetic field have been suggested .",
    "if the stratification is simple enough , the blue - only lobe in the stokes v profile is stronger ( weaker ) than the red lobe if the los velocity gradient as a function of depth is opposite ( equal ) to the magnetic field strength gradient @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that single - lobed profiles can be produced when the line of sight passes through a magnetopause , i.e. , a separatrix layer dividing the atmosphere vertically in two regions with different magnetic fields .",
    "magnetopauses occur frequently in the solar atmosphere .",
    "examples are the canopies created by expanding flux tubes in the network and the interfaces between different magnetic components in sunspot penumbrae ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that a tiny loop expanding towards the upper layers , being smaller than the spatial resolution , could create single - lobed stokes v profiles if the expansion of the magnetic field lines in one of the footpoints of the loop is larger than in the other . in this case , the footpoint related with the large expansion would create asymmetric stokes v profiles ( without extreme asymmetry ) , while the footpoint with normal expansion would produce symmetric stokes v profiles of opposite sign .",
    "the superposition of both profiles - as a result of limited spatial resolution - would cancel one of the lobe and , therefore , the observed profile would be a single - lobed stokes v profile(see figure  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite synthesized single - lobed stokes v profiles under the misma assumption .",
    "this type of unusual stokes v profiles has been related with upward traveling shocks driven by an aborted convective collapsed @xcite .",
    "they have been observed in convective collapse events that take place simultaneously in the photosphere and chromosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that stokes v profiles with large amplitude asymmetries are exclusively located at the boundary between regions with small - scale abnormal granulation and much larger normal - looking granules .",
    "recently , @xcite have successfully inverted single - lobed stokes v profiles located either in the neutral line of opposite polarity patches or in the _ very _ quiet sun .    the identification of the physical mechanism(s ) behind the single - lobed circular polarization profiles observed in the quiet sun represents both an observational and a theoretical challenge",
    "here , we use all the tools at our disposal to shed light on these intriguing profiles . we analyze a large number of spectropolarimetric measurements taken by hinode at high spatial resolution in order to determine the observational properties of the profiles in a statistically significant way ( sections  [ sec_datos]-[sec_solardisk ] ) and to investigate their temporal evolution ( section  [ sec_temp ] ) .",
    "we also apply stokes inversions to the data based on models with discontinuities along the line of sight ( section  [ sec_inv ] ) .",
    "the inversions successfully reproduce the observed spectra . finally , we search for single - lobed stokes v profiles in 3d magnetoconvection simulations of the quiet sun and study the magnetic and dynamic topologies associated with them .",
    "our combined approach allows us to draw a general picture of this phenomenon .",
    "a complementary analysis of single - lobed profiles in 3d magnetoconvection simulations has been performed recently by @xcite .",
    "the data used in this paper were obtained by the spectro - polarimeter ( sp ) located in the focal plane package ( fpp ) of the solar optical telescope ( sot , @xcite ) on board the hinode satellite @xcite .",
    "this instrument , hereafter referred to as hinode sot / sp measures the four stokes parameters of the lines at 6301 and 6302    with spectral sampling of 21.5 @xmath0  .",
    "the spatial scale can be 0.15  or 0.30  for the x direction ( perpendicular to the slit direction ) and 0.16  or 0.32  for the y direction ( parallel to the slit ) .",
    "for the first time , these data allow to investigate the four stokes parameters of the single - lobed stokes v profiles under seeing - free conditions and with unmatched spatial resolution .",
    "we use 72 data sets spanning a wide range of observational conditions : exposure time ( 1.6 , 3.2 , 4.8 , 8.0 , 9.6 and 12.6 s ) ; signal to noise ratio ( between 500 and 1000 , calculated as the inverse of the standard deviation , is calculated over 11 stokes v maps normalized to the intensity of the continuum from the first 11 spectral positions in the continuum of the observed profile , i.e. from 6300.90   to 6301.13  . ] , @xmath1 ) ; position on the solar disk ( 56 maps with 1.00 @xmath2 0.75 , 8 maps with 0.75 @xmath2 0.50 and 8 maps with 0.50 @xmath2 0 ) ; and spatial scale ( as mentioned above ) .",
    "our data sets contain scans of large quiet sun regions and narrower scans with typical widths of 2 - 10 granules , for a variety of heliocentric distances .",
    "table [ latabla ] in the appendix summarizes the basic parameters of the different observing runs .",
    "all the analyzed profiles have been calibrated using _",
    "_ routines .",
    "to identify single - lobed profiles , we have developed a code that checks the shape of the stokes v spectra and flags the ones that have only one lobe .",
    "this code was applied to almost @xmath3 pixels corresponding to the 72 selected observations .",
    "the code looks into the shape of the stokes v profiles , and takes into account the following constraints :    * the maximum ( minimum ) signal must be greater ( smaller ) than 4 ( -4 ) times @xmath1 . * at least three wavelength points",
    "must show signals above ( below ) the 4@xmath1 ( -4@xmath1 ) threshold . * simultaneously , the other lobe and the minimum ( maximum ) of the whole stokes v profile must be greater ( less ) than -3@xmath1 ( 3@xmath1 ) . * in the continuum , the circular polarization signal can never exceed @xmath4 3@xmath1 .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied by one of the lobes of 6301   or 6302  then the profile is flagged as a single - lobed profile . for 6301  ,",
    "the blue lobe goes from 6301.18@xmath5   ( @xmath6 ) ) in the measurement of the spectral line positions but it is present and the same in all the observational data studied in this work unless noted . ] to 6301.50   ( @xmath7 ) , and the red lobe from 6301.50   to 6301.82   ( @xmath8 ) . for 6302  ,",
    "the blue lobe is between 6302.17   ( @xmath6 ) and 6302.49   ( @xmath7 ) , while the red one goes from 6302.49   to 6302.82 (@xmath8 ) .    in order to relate the location of the single - lobed stokes v profiles with physical parameters ,",
    "we have extracted several line parameters from the observed stokes spectra :    * stokes i map : for the slit reconstructed stokes i map we used 8 spectral positions on the continuum , located between 6303.12   and 6303.27  .",
    "* stokes v map : in this case we used 36 spectral positions located on the blue wing of the stokes v profiles of 6302  , roughly from 6301.72   to 6302.49  . * doppler velocities , determined through line bisectors .",
    "we use the line bisector at the 70% intensity level ( the midpoint between the flanks of the line at that intensity ) minus the line core wavelength position of the average quiet sun profile .",
    "the difference is converted into velocity and expressed in km s@xmath9 .",
    "thus , the zero velocity is given by the local average quiet sun profile * the mean circular polarization degree is calculated as : @xmath10 * the mean linear polarization degree is calculated as : @xmath11 * the mean total polarization degree is calculated as : @xmath12    the integrals are evaluated from @xmath13=6301.29   to @xmath14=6301.71   in the case of 6301  , and from @xmath13=6302.27    to @xmath14=6302.70   for 6302  .",
    "these wavelength intervals cover all the relevant polarization signals , avoiding the contribution of the continuum .",
    "in figure 1 we show examples of blue - only and red - only stokes v profiles ( left and right panels , respectively ) .",
    "there are clear stokes q and u signals associated with the blue - only profiles , indicating the existence of inclined magnetic fields with respect to the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , both q and u are asymmetric profiles . for the red - lobe profile",
    "the stokes q and u signals are much smaller and appear to consist of a single lobe on the red wing of the lines . the continuum intensities are larger than 1 and around 1 for the blue - only and red - only profiles , respectively .",
    "this means that the blue - only profile corresponds to a bright structure in the intensity map .",
    "let us concentrate on a small region ( @xmath15 ) of one large scan for showing the location of the blue - only and red - only profiles .",
    "the measurements displayed in figure  [ comparai ] , were taken on september 24 , 2007 at 20 h 42 min ut .",
    "the spatial sampling is @xmath16 and @xmath17 in x and y direction respectively ; the exposure time is 12.8 s and its location is the center of the solar disk ( @xmath18 ) . figure  [ comparai ] shows that the blue - only profiles tend to be located in the outer part of the granules ( blue contours ) .",
    "in contrast , the red only profiles are mainly located in the intergranular area ( red contours ) .",
    "figures  [ perfazules ] and  [ perfrojos ] show the spatial distribution of the stokes v profiles in an area of 9 px @xmath19 9 px ( 1.35@xmath19 1.44 ) around the yellow crosses displayed in figure  [ comparai ] .",
    "for reference , the border of granules are represented by the black intensity contour .",
    "figure  [ perfazules ] makes it clear that there are no regular stokes v profiles of opposite polarities close to the blue - only profiles .",
    "this suggests that the processes leading to the absence of one lobe in stokes v are not related to the horizontal mixing of atmospheres with different physical conditions . in the case of red - only profiles ( figure  [ perfrojos ] ) , there are some asymmetric stokes v signals of opposite polarity nearby , but they seem to be related with the expansion of the granular edge in the intergranular lane ( see section  [ sec_temp ] ) .    .",
    "the horizontal lines mark @xmath20 ( dot - dot - dot - dashed lines ) and @xmath21 ( dot - dashed lines ) levels .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the nominal position of the core of the 6301   and 6302   lines .",

    "we have examined the location of the single - lobed profiles on the stokes i and v maps , dopplergrams , and polarization degree maps to understand the general behavior with respect to the intensity , velocity and magnetic field .",
    "in addition , we have calculated histograms for these physical quantities . for clarity , we only show the previously selected case , and the mean ranges for these quantities using the full data set .    the left panel of the first row in figure  [ mapas_histos ] shows the stokes i map of the studied case .",
    "we have selected 5 interesting locations marked with numbers and arrows . at first glance",
    ", this figure tells us two interesting properties of the single - lobed stokes v profiles : ( i ) the single - lobed profiles tend to appear in small patches .",
    "the red patches are very small and sometimes extend over one pixel only .",
    "by contrast , the blue patches are well - defined spatial structures , although they may look point - like too .",
    "( ii ) the majority of red - only profiles are located in intergranular lanes .",
    "the blue - only profiles are very often sited on the outer part of the granules , sometimes in intergranular lanes , and in a few cases in the center of granules .",
    "the right panel in the first row of figure  [ mapas_histos ] displays the histogram of the intensity normalized to the quiet sun continuum .",
    "although the distribution is rather broad -notice that the y axis is displayed in logarithmic scale- , it is clear that the blue - only profiles are more correlated with the brighter structures than the red - only profiles . except for the scans located very close to the limb",
    ", all the other data sets show this behavior . on average , the distribution associated with the blue - only profiles",
    "has the maximum at @xmath22 and spans the range @xmath23\\pm0.05 i_{c}$ ] . for the red - only profiles",
    "the maximum is located at @xmath24 and the range is @xmath25\\pm0.05 i_{c}$ ] .",
    "the ranges are very similar in both cases , but the distribution of the red - only profiles is always located to the left ( darker ) in comparison to the blue - only profiles , as it is shown in figure  [ mapas_histos ] . near the limb ,",
    "the ranges in intensity are similar for red - only and blue - only profiles , and the maximum are for both cases located at @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , it is hard to distinguish where these profiles are located .",
    "this is a consequence of the low intensity contrast at the limb .",
    "in addition , one should keep in mind that observations close to the limb refer to higher layers of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the dopplergram and the velocity distribution are shown in the second row of figure  [ mapas_histos ] . similarly to the intensity distribution , the velocities associated with single - lobed stokes v profiles show a broad range of variation , but there is a trend of the blue - only profiles to be associated with upflows ( negative velocities ) .",
    "the red - only profiles tend to be associated with downflows ( positive velocities ) . on average ,",
    "the maximum of the velocity distribution for the blue - only profiles is -0.8 km s@xmath9 , within the range [ -2,+1 ] km s@xmath9 . for the red -",
    "only profiles the maximum is 0.8 km s@xmath9 , with values ranging from -1  to + 2  km s@xmath9 .",
    "therefore , their velocities are roughly shifted + 1 km s@xmath9 with respect to those of the blue - only profiles . for the single - lobed stokes v profiles closer to the limb the ranges are [ -2,+3 ] km s@xmath9 and [ -2,+2 ] km s@xmath9 for the blue - only and red - only profiles , respectively",
    ". these results are in disagreement with @xcite : on average , he associated both the blue - only and red - only profiles with downflows , although the former had stronger downflows than the latter .",
    "now we describe the five locations marked in figure  [ mapas_histos ] that we consider interesting to analyze in more detail .",
    "locations # 1 and # 2 are two examples of large size patches .",
    "the first extends almost over the whole granule , while the second covers the outer part of two granules and the intergranular lanes .",
    "location # 1 sits in an upflow region ( dark areas in the dopplergram shown in figure  [ mapas_histos ] ) ; the lower part of location # 2 is also in an upflow region , but most part of it is in a transition region with velocities close to zero ( grey color in the dopplergram ) .",
    "location # 3 is just over the outer part of the granule with a high intensity and large upflows .    in the same figure ,",
    "the locations # 4 and # 5 show red - only profiles .",
    "the former is located in an intergranular lane , with strong downflows ( bright areas in the dopplergram ) .",
    "location # 5 is a structure nearly @xmath27 in size .",
    "it is over a transition region in the middle of two granules .",
    "it is not so well - defined as an intergranular region in the intensity map , but it is more evident in the dopplergram . in the dopplergram , this region",
    "is correlated with a narrow bright ( downflow ) intergranular lane and with the grey areas of the outer part of the neighboring granules .",
    "looking at the mean polarization degree maps we find other interesting properties of the single - lobed stokes v profiles .",
    "the third and the fourth row of figure  [ mapas_histos ] respectively show the mcpd and mlpd maps ( left ) and their distributions ( right ) .",
    "single - lobed profiles tend to be located at the periphery of magnetic flux concentrations showing strong linear and/or circular polarization signals .",
    "this fact can be seen at locations # 1 , # 2 and # 3 , where the contours are surrounded by strong magnetic components .",
    "these locations are close to magnetic structures but not exactly on them .",
    "the locations # 4 and # 5 are partially over magnetic structures with weak signals in the polarization degree maps .",
    "this is the most common behavior for the single - lobed stokes v profiles , as it can be seen in the distributions of the polarization degree shown in figure  [ mapas_histos ] .",
    "the mean circular polarization degree histogram follows a linear power law of index @xmath28 in the range [ 0.0008,0.04 ] .",
    "however , for the blue - only and red - only profiles the mean circular polarization degree histogram follows a sharper linear power law of index @xmath29 and @xmath30 for blue - only and red - only profiles , respectively , both in the range [ 0.0015,0.005 ] .",
    "the mean linear polarization degree histogram follows a linear power law of index @xmath31 in the range [ 0.0015,0.005 ] . in a similar manner ,",
    "the mean linear polarization histogram for red - only and blue - only profiles follows a power law of index @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , in the range of [ 0.0015,0.003 ] .",
    "both the blue - only and the red - only profiles are related with modest values of the longitudinal component and with the weaker transversal field components . in summary ,",
    "the single - lobed stokes v profiles are either close to strong magnetic structures -but not inside them- or over weak structures with both components of the magnetic field .",
    "the locations of the single - lobed stokes v profiles do not show a preference with the polarization sign of structures , i.e. , these profiles appear with the same probability near positive and negative magnetic fields ( see stokes v map in the left panel in figure  [ comparai ] ) .",
    "if we look in a larger area , as the one shown in figure  [ network0 ] , we can see how the single - lobed stokes v profiles are around abnormal granulation areas ( as region # 1 and # 4 ) but also in normal granulation regions ( as region # 2 and # 3 ) .",
    "this observation contradicts the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the single - lobed stokes v profiles are in the borders of the network patches -usually showing abnormal granulation pattern in continuum images- but never inside them .",
    "in addition , the single - lobed stokes v profiles are also present in the internetwork , where the granulation has normal properties .    figures [ network1 ] and [ network2 ] show the mcpd and mlpd for the same area as in figure  [ network0 ] . the large patches with strong signal form the network .",
    "the single - lobed stokes v profiles are never located inside these patches . rather , they surround the network and internetwork elements .",
    "the arrows mark the locations of several single - lobed stokes v profiles showing both circular and linear polarization signals , i.e. , where the magnetic field is inclined .",
    "figure [ lospeq ] shows the mcpd and mlpd maps in an area of roughly @xmath34 around the selected positions mark with arrows in figures  [ network1 ] and  [ network2 ] .",
    "as one can see , location # 1 and # 2 are in small patches with linear polarization signal and surrounded by network patches with strong circular polarization .",
    "location # 3 corresponds to an internetwork patch with strong linear polarization signal surrounded by small patches with weak circular polarization .            .",
    "bottom : the same zoomed areas for the mlpd displayed in figure  [ network2 ] .",
    "the three blue - only patches located in the center of the images have associated transversal polarization signal .",
    "the cases # 1 and # 3 are surrounded by structures with longitudinal component of the vector magnetic field .",
    "the case # 2 has simultaneously both components of * b*. the thresholds for the mcpd and mlpd maps are respectively @xmath35 and @xmath36.[lospeq],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "as mentioned above , we have examined 72 observing runs to search for single - lobed stokes v profiles . here , we present the behavior of these profiles with respect to their location on the solar disk . in table",
    "[ latabla ] we summarize the statistical properties of the profiles .",
    "the last 4 columns of the table give the following parameters : the signal to noise ratio ( _ s / n _ ) ; the percentage of blue - only profiles among the stokes v profiles with absolute signal greater than @xmath37 we refer to them as _ ` b ' _ and _ ` r ' _ respectively . ] ; the percentage of the red - only profiles , and the ratio between the blue - only and red - only profiles ( annotated as b / r ) .    we have plotted the number of occurrences of the blue - only and red - only profiles taking into account their location on the solar disk and exposure times in figure  [ b_texp ]",
    ". the color of the points codes the exposure time .",
    "sometimes , there is overlap between data points .",
    "for instance , at ( 1.0,1.6 ) there is a red point ( 12.8 s ) that overlaps a pink point ( 9.6 s ) .",
    "the fraction of blue - only profiles in the disk - center is roughly 4% .",
    "the plot shows that the fraction of blue - only profiles decreases as the observation is made closer to the limb ( roughly 1.6% near the limb ) .",
    "there is a decreasing trend in the fraction for the points of the same color as they are located closer to the limb ( left side of the plot ) .",
    "this fact does not depend on the exposure time , i.e. , the number of blue - only profile  decreases in the full range of circular polarization signal , not only in the stronger ones ( observed in the center of the solar disk with short exposure time ) , but also in the weaker ones ( observed in the limb with longer exposure time ) .    in contrast , the fraction of red - only profiles remains fairly constant for different positions on the solar disk ( roughly 2% ) .",
    "there is a slight increase of the green points , i.e. , from 1.3% in the disk - center to 3.2% at @xmath38 ( corresponding to observations with exposure time of 1.6 s ) .",
    "if we pay attention to the other colored points , the overall impression is that the variation with the heliocentric distance of the number of occurrence is nearly constant .",
    "the ratio of blue - only to red - only profiles is shown in figure  [ br_texp ] .",
    "this quantity drops from about 2 - 4 near the disk center to 0.5 as the limb is approached .",
    "this strong variation is mainly due to the strong reduction of the number of blue - only profiles toward the limb , not to changes in the red - only profiles which remain more or less constant .",
    "we have calculated the area occupied by the single - lobed stokes v profiles as the number of these profiles with respect the total number in every single map . in the region close to the center of the solar disk ,",
    "say @xmath39 , the blue - only profiles occupy 1% and the red - only profiles 0.4% of the solar surface .",
    "these values change as shown in figure  [ br_texp ] , where we see that the area occupied by them is 0.9% and 0.7% at @xmath40 , and 0.5% and 0.8% at @xmath41 for the blue - only and red - only profiles respectively .",
    "therefore , on average , the single - lobed stokes v profiles occupy less than 2% of the solar surface .     and their location on the solar disk .",
    "the vertical dashed line delimits the population i ( right ) and ii ( left ) ( see appendix ) .",
    "the color code stands the exposure time of the observations ( see the legend in the plot ) .",

    "the single - lobed stokes v profiles appear after the granule is formed , and the strength of the signal and size of the patch increases with time until the granule starts to disappear . from the available time - series , before of the images shown in the plot , the profiles in this area are noisy and start to show a single lobe ( similar to the first profile displayed in figure  [ evol_azu_ii ] ) . at these instants ,",

    "this could be due to several reasons : i ) we did not degrade the profiles to the hinode spatial and temporal resolution ; ii ) the vertical spatial resolution of the model may be not good enough to produce sharp jumps in the photosphere ; iii ) the magnetic field configuration might be too simplistic ; iv ) the amount of magnetic flux emergence in the box is probably different from that occurring in the quiet sun",

    "* the ratio of blue - only to red - only profiles drastically decreases from the center to the limb of the solar disk .",
    "this variation can be traced back to a strong reduction of the number of blue - only profiles .",

    "* the area occupied by the single - lobed stokes v profiles on the solar surface is less than 2% ( @xmath761% of the area is occupied by blue - only profiles and @xmath760.4% by red - only profiles ) .",

    "they are often located in places where there are simultaneously both circular and linear polarization signals , which suggests that they are associated with inclined fields , or that they occur because of a sudden change in the direction of the magnetic field . *",
    "both the blue - only and red - only profiles show weak or modest circular polarization signals and weak linear polarization signals . *",
    "the evolution of the single - lobed stokes v profiles is related to the evolution of the granules and intergranular lanes that host them .",

    "the number of single - lobed profiles and the statistics from the simulations are quiet similar to the observations , but there exist small differences that might be caused by missing physics ( see section  [ sec_con ] ) .",
    "the statistical and physical properties of the single - lobed stokes v profiles tell us that they can not be explained as the superposition of opposite - polarity stokes v profiles or as unusual events on the solar surface . on the contrary ,",
    "they show clear features associated with physical processes that could involve a sharp or drastic change of the orientation and strength of the magnetic field occurring mainly between the outer part of granules and the adjacent intergranular lanes .    from the few temporal evolutions that we studied , the blue - only profiles suggest a magnetic flux emergence processes , with lifetime comparable to the granulation lifetime .",
    "therefore , these patches first appear with weak polarization signal , then increase in size and strength . finally ,",
    "the blue - only patches disappear , but small stokes v signal remain in the region where the blue - only patches were sited for roughly one minute .",
    "we do not detect linear polarization with this profiles at the end , the signal in stokes v disappears with the disappearance of the granule , perhaps as result of a submergence process .",
    "we used the sirjump inversion code on this study after selecting suitable cases .",
    "this code can handle strong variations of the vector magnetic field and velocity along the line of sight , i.e. , it can model a magnetopause or slab structure in the pixel .",
    "in fact , both the inversion and the numerical simulations indicate that single - lobed profiles can be produced by discontinuities along the line of sight . in the simulations a wide range of atmosphere give rise to stokes v profiles with only one lobe .",
    "however , most of them are related to emerging magnetic field ( blue - only ) and disappearing or submerging magnetic field ( red - only ) .",
    "therefore , the statistical comparison between observations and simulations provides a tool to determine both the magnetic field topology in the quiet sun and its emerging and disappearing process in the local granulation .",
    "the lifetime of the single - lobed stokes v profile  must tell us the duration of the emergence and the submergence , i.e. , the duration of the fundamental input and output processes of magnetic flux .",
    "the absence of blue - only profiles near the limb might be due to these small structures being located in the lower - middle atmosphere while the red - only profiles might be located more or less equally at different heights or with some preference higher layers ( this is supported by what we observed in the inversions and in the forward model ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the simulation has a small discrepancy with the observations in the statistics .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the following reasons :    * the vertical spatial resolution of the simulations is not good enough . *",
    "the spatial resolution of hinode was not taken into account . *",
    "the amount of mean magnetic field , or the simplified initial magnetic configuration , may be off .",
    "* it is probably necessary to input periodically a specific amount of new emerging magnetic flux in the simulation .",
    "the input of new flux might require a different type of magnetic field configuration in the bottom boundary .",
    "moreover , the duration of each patch with new flux should last as long as the mean lifetime of the blue - only profiles ( as shown in section  [ sec_temp ] ) .",
    "once the simulations have good grid resolution and the synthetic profiles have been convolved with the spatial and spectral psf , then any remaining discrepancies between observations and simulations must tell us with which frequency , where , and how long new and small structures of magnetic field have to be injected . in order to approach a realistic simulation of the convection zone and photosphere of the quiet sun , the simulations must to reproduce the statistic study presented here ( sections  [ sec_spatial]-[sec_solardisk ] ) .",
    "we have focussed our attention on the quiet sun , but plage , active regions , and ephemeral regions might behave differently .",
    "thus , it is important to carry out similar studies in those structures for a better understanding of their magnetic topology and evolution .",

    "<S> these profiles require the presence of a velocity gradient along the line of sight , possibly associated with gradients of magnetic field strength , inclination and/or azimuth . </S>",
    "<S> we have focused our study on the stokes v profiles showing extreme asymmetry in the from of only one lobe . </S>",
    "<S> using hinode spectropolarimetric measurements we have performed a statistical study of the properties of these profiles in the quiet sun . </S>",
    "<S> we show their spatial distribution , their main physical properties , how they are related with several physical observables and their behavior with respect to their position on the solar disk . </S>",
    "<S> the single lobed stokes v profiles occupy roughly 2% of the solar surface . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we have observed their temporal evolution and have retrieved the physical conditions of the atmospheres from which they emerged using an inversion code implementing discontinuities of the atmospheric parameters along the line of sight . in addition , we use synthetic stokes profiles from 3d magnetoconvection simulations to complement the results of the inversion . </S>",
    "<S> the main features of the synthetic single - lobed profiles are in general agreement with the observed ones , lending support to the magnetic and dynamic topologies inferred from the inversion . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of all these different analysis suggests that most of the single - lobed stokes v profiles are signals coming from magnetic flux emergence and/or submergence processes taking place in small patches in the photospheric of the quiet sun . </S>"
