    "the great efforts devoted to the synthesis and investigation of nanosize magnetic molecules are motivated both by interests in fundamental physics and by the envisaged technological applications .",
    "for instance , some of these systems have shown phenomena such as quantum tunneling of magnetization between quasi - degenerate levels , slow relaxation at low @xmath2 , and revealed to be promising for high density information storage and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the magnetic core of molecular magnets is constituted by transition metal ions sorrounded by an organic shell which prevents intramolecular magnetic interactions . as a result",
    ", the microscopic properties of these nanoscale clusters can be investigated by means of bulk samples . among these systems , there are homonuclear antiferromagnetic ( af ) ring - shaped molecules formed by @xmath3 transition metal ions in an almost planar ring . in particular , in even membered rings",
    "the dominant af exchange interactions lead to a singlet @xmath4 ground state and the energy spectrum is characterized by rotational bands , with the lowest - lying levels approximately following the so - called land s rule @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the magnetization and the phonon - induced relaxation in the heterometallic ring cr@xmath0ni .",
    "this compound derives from the even membered af ring cr@xmath5 and thus provides a opportunity of a deeper insight in the role of topology in the static and dynamical quantum properties of magnetic wheels @xcite .",
    "cr@xmath0ni compound is obtained by the chemical substitution of a cr@xmath6 ion with a ni@xmath7 ion in the structure of the cr@xmath5 ring .",
    "this leads to a new molecular system formed by an odd number of unpaired electrons with dominant af nearest neighbour interactions as inferred by susceptibility measurements @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 ground state has been shown to be suitable to encode a qubit @xcite .",
    "the magnetic molecule has been theoretically analyzed within a spin hamiltonian approach , with the hamiltonian given by : @xmath9}\\nonumber\\\\ + \\sum_{i > j}\\textbf{s}(i)\\cdot\\textbf{d}_{ij}\\cdot\\textbf{s}(j)-\\mu_b\\sum_i{g_{i}\\textbf{h}\\cdot\\textbf{s}(i)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the spin operator of the the @xmath11th ion in the molecule ( @xmath12=3/2 for cr@xmath6 ions , and @xmath12=1 for the ni@xmath7 ion ) .",
    "the first term of the above equation is the dominant nearest neighbour heisenberg exchange interaction .",
    "the second and the third terms describe the uniaxial local crystal fields and anisotropic intracluster spin - spin interactions respectively ( with the @xmath13 axis assumed perpendicular to the plane of the ring ) . the last term represents the zeeman coupling with an external field @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters of the above hamiltonian were determined by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments @xcite . in order to corroborate the microscopic description of the cr@xmath0ni from ins data ,",
    "a detailed study of high field magnetization is very powerful .",
    "in fact , with high pulsed fields up to almost 60 t , spin multiplets not accessible to a standard ins experiment can be explored . in fig.[fig : cr7nim - article]a the magnetization curve as a function of the magnetic field @xmath14 is reported . a clear staircase structure with plateaus at @xmath15 , @xmath16 and odd multiples of @xmath17 reflects the change in the ground state due to the external field at the level anticrossing fields @xmath18 .",
    "an hysteresis of the measured magnetization curves has been observed .",
    "the effect arises from the non - equilibrium condition due to the high pulsed magnetic field with a few millisecond duration @xcite and has been discussed in terms of phonon bottle - neck effects and magnetic foehn effects @xcite .",
    "there is a very good agreement between the measured and calculated magnetization curves .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig.[fig : cr7nim - article]b where the positions of the main peaks of the calculated and measured @xmath19 matches correctly .",
    "the smaller peaks in the experimental @xmath19 are due to level anticrossings between excited energy levels .",
    "the effects are caused by the non - equilibrium exeperimental conditions and are not included in equilibrium calculations reported in fig.[fig : cr7nim - article ] @xcite .",
    "these results confirm that the microscopic picture derived from ins experiments @xcite perfectly holds even at very high applied magnetic fields .",
    "ni ( top ) and derivative @xmath19 ( bottom ) at t=1.3k .",
    "red ( dark gray ) and black lines represent the down and up experimental magnetic field processes respectively .",
    "the dashed blue lines represent the theoretical calculation with the following parameters : @xmath20=16.9k , @xmath21=19.6k , @xmath22=-0.3k , @xmath23=-4k , @xmath24=1.98 , @xmath25=2.2.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "a major obstacle to the proposed technological applications of magnetic molecules is constituted by phonon - induced relaxation .",
    "in fact , molecular observables , e.g. the magnetization , are deeply affected by the interaction of the spins with other degrees of freedom such as phonons @xcite . here",
    "we investigate the molecular spin - spin correlations through an approach based on a density matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the irreversible evolution of the density matrix @xmath26 can be determined through the secular approximation and focusing on time scales detectable by low - frequency techiques such as nmr . within this theoretical framework , a general expression for the quasi - elastic part of the fourier transform of cross correlation functions",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dimension of the hilbert spin space of the molecule , @xmath29 is the equilibrium population of the @xmath30th level and @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the @xmath30th eigenstate of the spin hamiltonian , while @xmath33 is the so called rate - matrix .",
    "the @xmath34 element @xmath35 of @xmath33 represents the probability per unit time of a transition between eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath36 induced by the interaction of the spins with phonons . by assuming that spin - bath interaction takes place mostly through modulation of local crystal fields",
    ", the rate matrix can be calculated on the basis of the eigenstates of molecular spin hamiltonian by first - order perturbation theory . with the choice of a spherical magnetoelastic ( me ) coupling @xcite the transition rates @xmath35 are given by : @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 the gap between the eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath36 of the molecule .",
    "in the last equation @xmath40 are quadrupolar operators @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath41 represents the spin - phonon coupling strength , which can be determined by comparing the theoretical results with experimental data .",
    "in fact , the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath1 probes the fluctuations of molecular observables , thus giving information on the relaxation dynamics @xcite . exploiting the moriya formula @xcite",
    ", the proton nmr @xmath1 can be evaluated in absolute units using as inputs the positions of the cr and ni ions and of the hydrogens of the molecule : @xmath42 where the @xmath43 are the fourier transforms of the cross correlation functions from eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) calculated at the larmor angular frequency @xmath44 , while the @xmath45 are geometric coefficients of the hyperfine dipolar interaction between magnetic ions and protons probed by nmr .     for different values of the applied field along z ( parallel to the ring axis).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the occurence of a peak in the proton nmr @xmath1 has been clearly explained in homonuclear ring - shaped molecules with small anisotropy such as cr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this case @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of @xmath48 @xcite : @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "this equation shows that the spectrum of fluctuations of @xmath48 is given by a sum of @xmath28 lorentzians , each with characteristic frequency @xmath50 , given by the eigenvalues of @xmath51 . for a wide range of @xmath14 and @xmath2 in these systems",
    "only a single relaxation frequency @xmath52 significantly contribute to @xmath53 . as a result ,",
    "if the dominant frequency @xmath52 intersects the larmor angular frequency , i.e. when @xmath54 , at the temperature @xmath55 the proton nmr @xmath1 shows a sharp peak @xcite .",
    "being an heterometallic ring , this explanation does not hold for cr@xmath0ni and eq.([eq : t1 ] ) has to be used .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations show that a peak in the reduced @xmath56 occurs in agreement with experimental data ( see fig.[fig : cr7ni - t1-hz ] ) . by fitting the observed peak position",
    "we have obtained @xmath57thz@xmath58 .",
    "a magnetization study of the heteronuclear antiferromagnetic ring - shaped nanomagnet cr@xmath0ni has been performed . a clear step - wise increase of magnetization with increasing field is observed .",
    "the very good agreement of high field magnetization measurements up to almost 60 t with calculation shows the spin hamiltonian approach to be suitable even at very high fields .",
    "the relaxation dynamics of the compound has been investigated by the proton nuclear - spin relaxation rate @xmath1 .",
    "our calculations are in very good quantitative agreement with experimental data .",
