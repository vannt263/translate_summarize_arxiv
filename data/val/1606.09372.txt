    "cooperative processes in atomic systems are of major interest as they occur in a wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "paradigmatic examples of cooperative processes are supperadiance and subradiance .",
    "the former stands for the enhanced - and the latter for the reduced - spontaneous emission of light by excited atoms placed in vacuum .",
    "these quantum many - body effects are the subject of intense research for more than sixty years ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they have recently regained attention in various contexts such as photon localization  @xcite , single photon cooperative emission  @xcite , non - equilibrium phase transition in dilute thermal gases of rydberg atoms  @xcite , cooperative lamb - shift  @xcite or superradiant clock laser  @xcite .",
    "superradiance was first predicted by dicke in his classic paper of 1954  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly interpreted as a cooperative behaviour , assisted by the electromagnetic field , in which the atoms successively synchronize their dipoles . during this evolution ,",
    "the atomic state is restricted to the symmetric subspace of the global hilbert space and the coherence created during the emission cascade leads to an enhanced spontaneous emission rate , proportional to the square of the number of atoms . in the superradiance effect ,",
    "the perfect synchronization of dipoles is the sole consequence of the indistinguishability of atoms in the sample . as long as it is impossible to tell from which atom a photon is emitted , the various de - excitations paths interfere together .",
    "constructive interference gives rise to superradiance whereas destructive interference leads to subradiance .",
    "subradiant states are of particular interest for atomic implementations of qubit systems as they can be immune against decoherence due to spontaneous emission @xcite .    for atoms to be indistinguishable , two requirements must be met : i ) the interatomic distance should be much smaller than the wavelength @xmath3 of the emitted radiation , and ii ) each atom should experience the same dipole - dipole shift due to the surrounding atoms .",
    "as soon as one of these requirements is not met , superradiance / subradiance will be altered @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "a dephasing between the atomic dipoles will occur which has the effect of coupling the global state vector to states of lower symmetry and reducing the coherence .",
    "the effects of the finite size of the atomic sample , i.e.  of the breakdown of condition i ) , have been studied by many authors .",
    "they can be accounted for by introducing the cooperativity parameter , @xmath4 with @xmath5 the number density , quantifying the reduction in emission rates  @xcite . for closely packed atoms ,",
    "@xmath6 and superradiance is pronounced , while it is suppressed for @xmath7 .",
    "the effects of dipole - dipole interactions , i.e.  of the breakdown of condition ii ) , have also been studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "they are significant when the atomic distribution is no longer invariant under permutation of the particles .",
    "hence , they are present as soon as the number of atoms exceeds two .",
    "the description of these effects involves a huge amount of degree of freedom as compared to the non - interacting case and it is therefore a hard task to solve the equations describing the atomic dynamics . in the literature , several methods have been proposed , such as effective two - atom master equation  @xcite , quantum trajectory approach @xcite and optimally convergent quantum jump expansion @xcite .",
    "remarkably , some analytical solutions exist @xcite , however their expressions are often quite involved except in few particular cases , which makes it difficult to extract the main features of these effects .    in this paper , we study the combined effects of the breakdown of conditions i ) and ii ) on superradiance and subradiance .",
    "this is particularly interesting as these conditions are generally incompatible : small interatomic distances lead to small finite - size effects but to large dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we provide quantitative results about the impact of dipolar interactions on the dynamics of a finite - size atomic sample of @xmath8 and @xmath9 atoms by solving the full master equation for randomly distributed atoms in space .",
    "we analyse the time evolution of the radiated energy rate and of a proper measure of coherence of the atomic system for two different initial states : a fully - excited state and a decoherence - free state ( in the absence of dipolar interactions ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the system under investigation and the master equation governing its dynamics . in section iii",
    ", we explain our method to study the combined effects of finite - size and dipole - dipole interactions on cooperative processes .",
    "section iv is dedicated to our results for the two different situations considered above : superradiance and subradiance .",

    "we consider a system of @xmath10 identical two - level atoms at fixed positions @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field , initially in vacuum .",

    "we consider that the atomic levels are coupled by @xmath20-polarized light , so that @xmath18 can be taken real .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath39 ( eq .  ( [ lsh ] ) ) describes the conservative dipolar interactions between neutral atoms , that can be interpreted as virtual transverse photon exchanges between excited and ground state atoms @xcite .",
    "the dissipator @xmath40 ( eq .  ( [ dissipator ] ) ) accounts for dissipation , i.e.  photon emission .",
    "the internal dynamics of the atoms depend both on their relative positions @xmath41 and on the atomic transition wavelength @xmath42 through the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath35 on which the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath29 depend ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fij ] ) and ( [ eq : gammaij ] ) ) . in particular , the rate of energy released by the atoms is known to depend drastically on the dimensionless parameter @xmath44  @xcite",
    "two limiting regimes appear when this ratio is large or small compared to unity . for the sake of clarity and to introduce notations , we briefly outline the main features associated to these two regimes .    for distant atoms ( @xmath45 ) , one has @xmath46 in this regime , dipolar interactions are negligible and the master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) describes @xmath10 independent emitters .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the positive semidefinite matrix @xmath47 with entries @xmath30 has a @xmath10-fold degenerate eigenvalue equal to @xmath48 , the decay rate of an isolated atom .",
    "superradiance and subradiance are completely suppressed in this regime .    for spatially close atoms ( @xmath49 ) , one has @xmath50 in this regime , cooperative effects play a prominent role and collective spontaneous emission processes , such as superradiance or subradiance , are observable .",

    "this particular form of the dissipator , in terms of collective spin operators , hightlights the indistinguishability of atoms regarding dissipation processes and preserves the symmetry of the atomic state . from a physical point of view",
    ", it is impossible to track down the atom that has emitted a photon when @xmath49 , because then the wavelength of the radiation is much larger than the size of the atomic sample .",
    "the atomic state evolves in the symmetric subspace of the global hilbert space , spanned by the dicke states @xmath55 of maximal cooperation number @xmath56 .",
    "dicke states are defined as simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the collective spin operators .",
    "the corresponding time evolution , a cascade down the @xmath55 ladder , is commonly interpreted as a consequence of the phase - synchronization of the atomic dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "the rate at which this evolution occurs can be interpreted in terms of interference between multiple emission paths  @xcite .",
    "however , apart from these two limiting regimes , dephasing between atomic dipoles occurs during the dynamics .",
    "dipole - dipole interactions lead to excitation trapping in the system , thereby contributing to a decrease of the photon emission rate .",
    "the decay rates , given by the real part of the eigenvalues of the liouvillian @xmath60 , depend on the particular atomic arrangement through the dipole - dipole shifts @xmath29 and dissipation rates @xmath30 .    in the following , we shall refer to the _ pure superradiant regime _ as the regime in which @xmath61",
    "in the general case of random atomic distributions , dipole - dipole interactions couple symmetric states ( in particular the fully excited state ) to states with lower symmetry .",
    "the number of available states increases exponentially with the number of atoms and it quickly becomes intractable to extract the main features of the dynamics as a function of the different parameters , even when analytical solutions exist . in most analytical works ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the solutions exhibit complicated expressions and the main features of the dynamics are difficult to extract from them . for this reason ,",
    "we choose to adopt a statistical approach in order to extract the typical behavior of the atomic dynamics .",
    "our numerical procedure is as follows .",
    "we generate random atomic distributions in spherical containers with an average interatomic distance @xmath2 . for each distribution , we compute the radiated energy rate ( [ eq : int ] ) and the coherence ( [ eq : coh ] ) from the full solution of the master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) .",
    "finally , we compute average values over all distributions ( typically a few thousands , see appendix for further details ) of the radiated energy rate and the coherence defined below . note that , in the simulations , all random atomic distributions are characterized by the same magnitude of the key parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the procedure is then repeated for different values of @xmath0 .    since dipole - dipole interactions do not alter the atomic dynamics when there are only @xmath62 atoms , we focus on systems made of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath9 atoms in the following .",

    "in this paper , we studied the interplay between finite - size effects and dipole - dipole interactions on the cooperative dynamics of two - level atoms coupled to the electromagnetic field in vacuum .",
    "we first investigated the case of an initial fully - excited state which is known to lead to superradiance in the small sample limit ( superradiant limit ) .",
    "our statistical approach allowed us to observe a reduction of the radiated energy rate , as in previous works  @xcite , but also to show the existence of an optimal value of @xmath0 for which superradiance is the less affected .",
    "this optimal value , of the order of @xmath150 for @xmath148 and increasing with @xmath10 , was shown to result from the competition between finite - size effects and dipole - dipole interactions which is the most pronounced when the size of the atomic sample is of the order of the radiation wavelength .",
    "we also investigated the time evolution of the coherence of the atomic state and showed again the existence of a value of @xmath0 ( slightly different from the one for the energy rate ) for which the coherence is maximum .",
    "we then moved our focus to a three - atom system initially in a subradiant state which is dark in the superradiant limit .",
    "we found that the dynamics for different values of @xmath0 display common features : for @xmath171 , the energy rate and coherence reach a maximum and decrease algebraically at large times .",

    "exponential decays are recovered as is typical for independent spontaneous emissions .",
    "surprisingly , for the range of intermediate values @xmath181 , the subradiant state ( [ eq : dfs2 ] ) exhibits superradiance .    fd would like to thank the f.r.s .-",

    "in this section , we present further details about our computations and analytical calculations . we also discuss the averaging procedure used in this work to obtain statistical quantities such as @xmath116 and @xmath139 .      a common approach to solve a master equation like eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) is to work in the dressed - states basis obtained from the diagonalization of the conservative part  @xcite .",
    "some authors prefer to work instead in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of the non - unitary part , see e.g.  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the motivation is to split the global hilbert space into orthogonal subspaces between which no coherences can be created during the time evolution . with this idea in mind , we choose in this work to gather states with the same number of excitations @xmath182 and write the @xmath10 two - level atom density matrix in the basis @xmath183 @xmath184 @xmath185 @xmath186 as @xmath187 where @xmath188 stands for a block of dimension @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the form ( [ rhoform1 ] ) of the atomic density matrix is retained for all times @xmath191 because i ) dipole - dipole interactions conserve the excitation number and couple elements within each block , and ii ) the dissipative part only couples density matrix elements within different blocks and does not create coherences between blocks .",
    "hence , all matrix elements outside the blocks , which are initially zero for the states considered in this work , remain zero at any time .",
    "the number of matrix elements among the @xmath192 which need effectively to be accounted for in the case of an initial fully excited state is thus @xmath193 ( which is equal to @xmath194 for @xmath195 , @xmath196 for @xmath98 and @xmath197 for @xmath100 ) .",
    "when the system is initially in the subradiant state ( [ eq : dfs2 ] ) , it contains at most one excitation and @xmath21 only involves @xmath198 ( real ) variables .    to solve the master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) ,",
    "it is first cast into a system of first - order coupled differential equations @xmath199 where @xmath200 is square matrix and @xmath201 is the vectorization of the density matrix ( [ rhoform1 ] ) .",
    "the system ( [ eq : mev ] ) is then solved via @xmath202 with @xmath203 the initial state .",
    "the radiated energy rate and coherence are subsequently computed using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) and ( [ eq : coh ] ) .",
    "we generate random atomic distributions in spherical containers with prescribed average interatomic distance @xmath2 .",
    "we do this by picking random positions within a sphere of arbitrary radius and rescaling all interatomic distances by their average .",
    "then we multiply atomic positions by the prescribed @xmath2 .",
    "note that we discard distances smaller than the bohr radius ( @xmath204 ) , since the divergence ( @xmath205 ) of the static dipole - dipole interaction between atoms is not physical when the atomic electron clouds overlap at distances @xmath206  @xcite .",
    "the master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) depends on the adimensional parameters @xmath207 and @xmath35 ( angle between the vector @xmath41 connecting atoms @xmath17 and @xmath37 and the dipole moment @xmath18 ) through the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath29 given in eqs .",

    "these oscillations , also known as beats , were first pointed out by richter @xcite and are due to unequal dipole - dipole shifts . when the dipole - dipole shifts are almost equal , the oscillations are less pronounced and @xmath89 tends to the pure superradiant intensity .",
