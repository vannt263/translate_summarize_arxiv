    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of formalism and applications of tddft ) .    the central quantity in tddft , the time - dependent exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential @xmath0 , has to be approximated in practice , and the success ( or the failure ) of a tddft calculation depends critically on the quality of the chosen xc functional .",
    "the most widely used approximation for the xc potential in tddft is the adiabatic approximation : @xmath1 \\:,\\ ] ] where some given xc potential @xmath2 $ ] from static dft is evaluated at the time - dependent density @xmath3 .",
    "this idea seems certainly reasonable for systems that are slowly varying in time .",
    "the most common example of this approach is the adiabatic local - density approximation ( alda ) where , in addition to a slow change over time one also assumes slow spatial variations .",

    "we mention that the well - known failure of the alda to reproduce optical absorption spectra in extended systems @xcite has less to do with the neglect of retardation , but is due to the wrong spatial long - range behavior of the linear - response xc kernel",
    ".    another well - known class of problems where the adiabatic approximation fails are correlated double photoionization processes in atoms and molecules ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the most notorious case is the direct double ionization of helium @xcite , which has been a persistently nagging problem for tddft in any of the standard xc approximations @xcite .",
    "systematic studies of plasmon - like charge - density oscillations in quantum wells and quantum rings @xcite have uncovered further examples where it is necessary to go beyond the alda .",

    "a fully - fledged treatment of memory and retardation in tddft presents many technical difficulties , although quite a bit of progress has been made recently .",
    "the most fruitful approaches so far are based on ideas of hydrodynamics and elasticity theory , where the memory resides in the dependence of a fluid element s motion and deformation on its initial position , and where retardation effects cause the electron liquid to be subject to viscoelastic stresses @xcite .",
    "applications of these ideas to polymers @xcite and quantum wells @xcite have met with some success , but there are also fundamental problems .",
    "a particularly disquieting situation arises in finite systems , where the hydrodynamic tddft approach results in excitation energies with unphysical imaginary parts @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new , simple and intuitive approach to retardation effects in tddft .",
    "the approach is based on an extension the so - called generator coordinate ( gc ) method , which was originally introduced in nuclear physics by wheeler and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the gc method expresses the many - body wavefunction in terms of a superposition of states arising from deformed auxiliary hamiltonians , using a variational optimization of the expansion coefficients .",
    "in the present paper , we derive and apply a time - dependent generalization of the gc method , combining it with tddft .",
    "the result is an approximation to the time - dependent many - body wave function , built from slater determinants which come from deformed time - dependent kohn - sham hamiltonians .",

    "the seed functions were obtained from a simplified schrdinger - like equation featuring a deformed nuclear potential .    over the years , the gc method has found widespread use in a large variety of problems in nuclear and electronic many - body physics @xcite . in quantum chemistry ,",
    "the ghw variational equations were used to develop high - quality hartree - fock and dirac - fock single - particle basis functions @xcite .",

    "recently , a connection between the gc method and static dft was established by capelle @xcite .",

    "a first illustrative numerical calculation of this new approach , showing its viability and potential , was made in ref .",
    "@xcite for the helium isoelectronic series . in this case , a single set of deformation parameters was tested together with a simple functional , the x - only lda , to obtain ground - state energies and the weight functions . through eq .",
    "( [ gcdftwf ] ) an approximation to the many - body wave function was established and the expectation values of the operator @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , were calculated .    the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that the ground - state energies obtained are considerably better than those calculated from both the lda generator functionals themselves and more sophisticated gradient - corrected xc functionals .",
    "the many - body wave functions were obtained with almost no additional numerical effort , yielding expectation values that are close to those given by other methods .",
    "thus , the gc method is a cheap and conceptually simple way to improve existing xc functionals .",
    "the method is , of course , not restricted to the helium isoelectronic series .",
    "moreover , it can also be used to extract excitation energies .",
    "work along these lines will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us now extend the gc - dft approach into the time domain .",

    "we show that the tdghw equation satisfies two key properties : it reduces to the static ghw equation ( [ ghweq ] ) in the limit where @xmath29 is time - independent , and it conserves the norm of the total wavefunction ( [ gctddftwf ] ) .    in practice ,",
    "one first chooses a mesh of @xmath13-values and obtains the initial ks orbitals @xmath51 and the weight functions @xmath52 from a static gc - dft calculation .",
    "one then propagates the tdks equation ( [ tdks ] ) for each ks orbital and each value of @xmath13 , from @xmath40 to @xmath45 . then",
    ", the matrix elements ( [ actionmatrix ] ) and ( [ overlapmatrix ] ) are formed , and the tdghw equation can be solved by time propagation , which yields the time - dependent weight functions @xmath36 . the final step is to calculate the observables of the system under study .    in appendix [ appendixb ]",
    "we discuss our numerical approach to solve the discretized tdghw equation using the crank - nicholson algorithm , which guarantees a unitary time evolution of @xmath53 .",
    "to illustrate the gc - tddft approach , we consider a system of two interacting electrons confined by a spherically symmetric harmonic potential @xmath54 , known as hooke s atom .",
    "the great advantage of this system is that the associated two - body schrdinger equation separates into center - of - mass and relative coordinates , and can therefore be solved in a straightforward manner , even in the time - dependent case @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compare our approximate tddft and gc - tddft results with exact numerical solutions of the full schrdinger equation , at a relatively small computational cost .    in the following",

    "hooke s atom resembles the helium atom in many respects , but there is one important difference : due to the harmonic confining potential , hooke s atom has no continuum of unbound states and hence can not be ionized . therefore it can not be used to address the issue of direct double ionization @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , hooke s atom is a useful model system for studying correlated electron dynamics , including double excitations .",
    "it is known that tddft provides the time - dependent density @xmath3 in principle exactly , but runs into difficulties whenever one is interested in observables that are not easily expressed as explicit functionals of the density .",
    "thus , a quantity such as the radial expectation value @xmath60 can be easily calculated , since it involves only the total density . by contrast",
    "consider the following quantities for a two - electron system @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the probabilities of finding both electrons inside or outside of an imaginary spherical box of radius @xmath64 surrounding the system , and @xmath65 is the probability of finding one electron inside and the other one outside the box .",
    "for a two - electron real atom , these quantities are ionization probabilities , provided @xmath64 is large enough .    by the runge - gross theorem @xcite , @xmath62 , @xmath65 and @xmath63 have the formal property of being functionals of the time - dependent density .",
    "the explicit form of these functionals , however , is unknown , and it is therefore very difficult to extract @xmath62 , @xmath65 and @xmath63 only from @xmath3 .",
    "it is common practice ( although not formally justified ) to replace the full interacting wave function @xmath23 in eqs .",
    "( [ p0])([p1 ] ) by the ks wave function @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , it comes as no surprise that the so - defined ks probabilities fail to capture the essence of the correlated double ionization processes in helium @xcite .",

    "we now present results for parametrically driven oscillations of hooke s atom , comparing exact solutions of the time - dependent two - particle schrdinger equations with various levels of tddft and time - dependent gc - dft .    in the following , we use time - dependent spring constants @xmath66 with a trapezoidal shape for @xmath59 , with a switch - on by a linear two - cycle ramp , followed by 5 cycles at constant amplitude @xmath57 , and a two - cycle linear switch - off",
    ". driven by the time - dependent spring constant , the system carries out breathing - mode oscillations which preserve the initial spherical symmetry .",

    "the alda completely fails to reproduce the behavior of the driven hooke s atom .",
    "this can be seen very clearly from fig .",
    "[ exaldar ] : in alda , the radial expectation value oscillates with a constant amplitude after the trapezoidal pulse is over .",
    "by contrast , the exact @xmath69 exhibits a beating pattern , where the amplitude of the oscillations is strongly modulated .",
    "likewise , the probabilities @xmath62 , @xmath65 and @xmath63 show a drastic amplitude modulation , which is absent in alda .",
    "the physical origin of the beating patterns in the charge - density oscillations is a superposition of the dynamics associated with single and multiple excitations .",
    "for hooke s atom , the beating pattern is particularly pronounced since , due to the harmonic confining potential , the electronic level separations are nearly equidistant , which makes the coupling to double and higher excitations very efficient . a similar though less pronounced modulation effect of charge - density oscillations was recently analyzed for two electrons confined on a two - dimensional quantum strip @xcite .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the alda fails to capture any type of excitations which does not have a counterpart in the kohn - sham single - particle spectrum , such as double excitations @xcite . nevertheless , the sheer magnitude of the error of alda exhibited in figs .",
    "[ exaldar][exaldap2 ] comes somewhat as a surprise .      in a first attempt to improve the alda description with the gc - tddft approach , we consider the following deformed xc potential : @xmath74 \\ : .",

    ", the alda does not capture such a scenario correctly , whereas the deformed xc potential ( [ advxc ] ) , for @xmath76 , cancels this error .",

    "we find that the improvement of the adiabatic gc - tddft over the pure alda is marginal .",
    "there is a hint of an amplitude modulation in all cases , but it is by far insufficient compared to the exact data .    a possible reason for the failure of this method is the peculiar nature of hooke s atom which prevents ionization .",
    "it seems plausible that in a real atom , where one or both electrons can ionize , the approximate treatment of the self - interaction error implied in eq .",
    "( [ advxc ] ) might be more beneficial .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the adiabatic approximation omits memory and retardation effects , which have been shown to be crucial for the treatment of double and multiple excitations @xcite .",

    "[ exhxcdwf ] , for the nonadiabatic gc - tddft calculation with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we will focus in particular on the two cases @xmath90 and 4 , which corresponds to a @xmath91 and @xmath83 phase lag of the xc potential with respect to the driving force .",
    "we observe that @xmath92 strongly decreases after @xmath93 fs , after the end of the driving trapezoidal pulse .",
    "the opposite happens for @xmath94 , which starts out small and picks up after the driving pulse is over .",
    "taken together , this is exactly what is needed to to produce the observed amplitude modulations of the charge - density oscillations , with a node approximately at @xmath93 fs , see fig .",
    "[ exhxcdr ] .",
    "the amplitude suppression happens due to the contribution of the @xmath95 tdks determinant , where the @xmath91 phase lag simulates dissipation .",
    "the subsequent increase of the amplitude requires the contribution of the @xmath96 determinant , where the @xmath83 phase lag simulates an elastic behavior .    a similar way of explaining the amplitude modulations was discussed in ref . @xcite",
    ". the time - dependent xc potential alternatingly acts as a driving and a dissipative force , and is thus able to increase and reduce the amplitude of the charge - density oscillations .",
    "the adiabatic approximation , in particular the alda , continues to be the workhorse for mainstream applications in tddft , such as molecular excitation spectra .",
    "however , as shown by maitra _",
    "@xcite , the description of more complicated processes such as multiple or charge - transfer excitations mandates a time - dependent xc functional which includes memory .",
    "since these excitation processes are extremely relevant in ( bio)chemistry , there is an urgent need to address the question of how to go beyond the adiabatic approximation in tddft .    in this paper , we have proposed a conceptually and computationally simple method to treat memory effects in tddft .",
    "our approach is based on a new extension of the well - known generator coordinate ( or griffin - hill - wheeler ) method to time - dependent systems .",
    "in essence , we represent the @xmath9-body wavefunction as a superposition of a few nonorthogonal ks slater determinants , coming from a set of tdks hamiltonians featuring deformed xc potentials .",
    "the weight functions are optimized with a stationary action principle .",
    "the key is that our method allows not only _ spatial _ , but also _ temporal _ deformations of the xc potential .",
    "this allows for a very cheap way to bring in memory , namely by evaluating the xc potential at time @xmath82 using a density at a previous time @xmath79 as input .",
    "the variational principle then determines how each of these retarded xc potentials are weighted relative to each other .",
    "the numerical effort of the resulting gc - tddft scheme is quite manageable .",
    "we have applied our gc - tddft scheme to describe parametric oscillations in a strongly driven hooke s atom , a two - electron system with the special properties that it can not ionize and that its levels are nearly equally spaced .",
    "therefore , the interplay between single and multiple excitations is particularly pronounced , leading to a very strong modulation of the free charge - density oscillations .",
    "these modulations are impossible to capture in alda or any non - retarded gc - tddft scheme .",
    "by contrast , our gc - tddft with memory reproduced the effect extremely well .",
    "the gc - tddft allows for a wide range of possible deformations in the tdks hamiltonian .",
    "as we have shown , one can choose deformations which remove part of the self - interaction error , and which bring in retardation in a simple way .",
    "the success of the gc - tddft approach thus crucially depends on choosing deformations according to the particular physical characteristics and requirements of the systems under study .",
