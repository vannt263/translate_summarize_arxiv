    "we live in a time where people increasingly turn to the web for help .",
    "our needs , however , often go far beyond mere information from existing webpages and we need help from real people . for example , we ask for answers to specific questions on _ stackoverflow.com_ , for donations on _ donorschoose.org_ , or for help on online social communities such as _ reddit.com_. in each of these cases a user performs a request , which we define as an act of asking formally for something .",
    "all these communities rely heavily on their members to help satisfy the request . yet",
    ", the factors that lead community members to satisfy a request remain largely unknown .",
    "understanding the dynamics and factors of successful requests has the potential to substantially improve such communities by educating users about better formulating requests and promoting likely - to - succeed requests @xcite .",
    "in addition to these practical benefits , understanding the factors that make a request successful has implications for questions in social psychology and linguistic pragmatics .    studies on the popular crowdfunding platform kickstarter have shown that the success of a request depends most crucially on _ what _ is being requested , that is , whether it is a small favor like an answer to a simple question or a large financial contribution @xcite .",
    "many other factors need to be controlled as well ; what the giver receives _ in return _ , _ when _ they are asking , and even group dynamics , since people are more likely to give to projects that others are already giving to @xcite .",
    "satisfying a request on peer - to - peer lending or crowd - funding platforms can also bring a reward , and this also can drive the selection process .",
    "it is extremely difficult to disentangle the effects of all these factors in determining what makes people satisfy requests , and what makes them select some requests over others .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a framework for controlling for each of these potential confounds while studying the role of two aspects that characterize compelling requests : _ social _ factors ( _ who _ is asking and how the recipient is related to the donor and community ) and _ linguistic _ factors ( _ how _ they are asking and what linguistic devices accompany successful requests ) . with the notable exception of @xcite ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the effect of language on the success of requests has largely been ignored thus far .",
    "our goal is to understand what motivates people to give when they do not receive anything tangible in return .",
    "that is , we focus on the important special case of _ altruistic _ requests in which the giver receives no rewards .",
    "this controls for the incentive to obtain attractive rewards commonly offered on crowdfunding sites such as kickstarter ; the absence of external factors such as tangible rewards also makes the language itself all the more important in persuading others to help . in this domain",
    "we also do not need to consider crowdfunding - related marketing strategies such as emphasizing limited time offers ( scarcity ) or showing that other people made the same decision already ( social proof ) @xcite , which are known to manifest themselves in language @xcite .",
    "second , we focus on requests that a single user can fulfill , thereby additionally eliminating group behavior effects such as herding @xcite or completing donation biases @xcite . finally , we focus on one community in which _ what _ is being asked for is held constant .",
    "this allows us to explore a large number of different requests of different individual users , at different times , that all have the same goal .",
    "controlling for the request goal therefore allows us to study how to optimize a particular request solely by optimizing its presentation , and helps provide a direct practical benefit to the requester ( by contrast , advising a requester who needs something to instead ask for something different may be advice of limited practical use ) .",
    "we therefore chose to study donations in `` random acts of pizza '' , an online community devoted to giving away free pizza to strangers that ask for one .",
    "random acts of pizza ( raop ) is a community within the social news and entertainment website _",
    "reddit.com_. users can submit requests for free pizza and if their story is compelling enough a fellow user might decide to send them one , `` _ _ because ... who does nt like helping out a stranger ? the purpose is to have fun , eat pizza and help each other out .",
    "together , we aim to restore faith in humanity , one slice at a time .",
    "_ '' a typical post might sound something like this : `` _ _ it s been a long time since my mother and i have had proper food .",
    "i ve been struggling to find any kind of work so i can supplement my mom s social security ... a real pizza would certainly lift our spirits _ _ @xcite . ''",
    "this platform addresses many of the potential confounds that complicate other platforms or studies : all requests ask for the same thing , a pizza , there are no additional incentives or rewards , each request is satisfied by a single user , users and requests are embedded in a social network within reddit , and requests are largely textual .",
    "this dataset thus provides us with an unusually clear picture of the effect of language and social factors on success .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : inspired by studies in crowdfunding , user - to - user evaluations in social networks , and helping behavior in social psychology , we introduce a variety of textual and social factors that are potentially associated with successful requests .",
    "we use topic modeling and automatic detection to extract a particularly complex factor , the _ narrative _ structure of requests .",
    "we employ a logistic regression framework to test what factors matter in the community , showing that narratives are significantly correlated with success , and that signaling gratitude , the intention to reciprocate in the future , supporting the narrative with additional evidence , as well as a high status of the user within the community further increase the chance of success .",
    "we do not find any support for theories predicting that positive sentiment , politeness , and user similarity are associated with success .",
    "thus , drawing from social psychology literature , our extracted high - level social features operationalize the relation between recipient and donor .",
    "we then demonstrate in a prediction task that the proposed model generalizes to unseen requests and significantly improves over several baselines .",
    "our dataset contains the entire history of the random acts of pizza subreddit from december 8 , 2010 to september 29 , 2013 ( 21,577 posts total ) . to compute user features",
    "we further crawled the entire lifetime history of posts and comments across all subreddits for all users involved in the raop subreddit ( 1.87 m submissions total ) .",
    "the community only publishes which _ users _ have given or received pizzas but not which _ requests _ were successful . in the case of successful users posting multiple times it is unclear which of the requests was actually successful .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis to users with a single request for which we can be certain whether or not it was successful , leaving us with 5728 pizza requests .",
    "we split this dataset into development ( 70% ) and test set ( 30% ) such that both sets mirror the average success rate in our dataset of 24.6% .",
    "all features are developed on the development test only while the test set is used only once to evaluate the prediction accuracy of our proposed model on held - out data .",
    "for a small number of requests ( 379 ) we further observe the identity of the benefactor through a `` thank you '' post by the beneficiary after the successful request .",
    "this enables us to reason about the impact of user similarity on giving .",
    "previous work on crowdfunding , helping behavior and user - to - user evaluations in social networks have pointed to a number of textual and social factors that could influence the success of a request .",
    "a person experiencing gratitude is more likely to behave prosocially towards their benefactor and others @xcite .",
    "however , gratitude is only one component of politeness @xcite .",
    "other indicators include deference , greetings , indirect language , apologizing and hedges .",
    "we ask a more general question : does a polite request make you more likely to be successful ?",
    "in social psychology , _ reciprocity _ refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action .",
    "people are more likely to help if they have received help themselves @xcite . since in altruistic domains",
    ", there is no possibility of direct reciprocity , we hypothesize that recipients might pay the kindness _ forward _ to another community member , a concept known as `` generalized reciprocity '' @xcite .",
    "feelings of gratitude can elicit this behavior @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that the community would be more willing to fulfill the request of someone who is likely to contribute to the community later on .",
    "while many requests are fairly negative , talking about lost jobs , financial problems , or relationship breakups , some of them are positive , asking for pizza for birthday parties and other celebrations . helping behavior literature predicts that positive mood is associated with a higher likelihood of giving @xcite .",
    "while these studies refer to the sentiment or emotional state of the benefactor , the most closely related linguistic feature that is available in this setting would be the sentiment of the text .",
    "thus , the literature would predict that very positive requests are more likely to succeed .",
    "we additionally expect that very negative requests could be more successful , too , since they most likely describe very unfortunate situations of the requester .",
    "studies on the success of research grant proposals have shown that the simple factor of request length can be significantly related to funding success even when controlling for a variety of other factors @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that longer requests will be interpreted as showing more effort on the side of the requester and giving them the opportunity to provide more evidence for their situation .",
    "studies on crowdfunding have shown that the size of the social network of the project creator is associated with success @xcite .",
    "work on user - to - user evaluations in online social networks suggests that the success of a request depends on who you are as a user and particularly that notions of user status and user similarity could be influential in the process @xcite .",
    "we study both status and similarity in this work .",
    "the textual part of a request , the narrative , has been shown to significantly influence the outcome in peer - to - peer lending platforms @xcite . in order to understand the nature and power of different narratives without coding them manually @xcite , we explore automatic methods of narrative extraction .",
    "consider the following two pizza requests :          to identify the different kinds of stories we draw on previous literature suggesting that narratives can be automatically extracted using topic modeling and related techniques @xcite .",
    "we therefore perform topic modeling through non - negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite of a tf - idf weighted bag - of - words representation @xcite of the requests in our dataset .",
    "we additionally enforce sparsity on the topic distribution for each request to shape the topics in a way that captures most of a given request , and restrict ourselves to nouns ( using the stanford part - of - speech tagger ) .",
    "we choose to use 10 topics and use a svd - based initialization for nmf @xcite .",
    "the resulting topics are shown in table [ table : topic_modeling ] along with descriptive names , the 15 highest - scoring terms and the success rate ( fraction of requests that successfully obtained pizza ) .",
    "we observe that many topic clusters follow a specific theme and that their success rates vary dramatically ( the average success rate is 24.6% ) .",
    "topics money1 and money2 focus on money , and the high success rate of topic money1 ( 32.3% ) suggests that this is a particularly successful narrative . topic job is similarly successful ( 31.9% ) and features job related terms . a large number of requests further seem to come from college students talking about studying for classes and finals , their roommates , and the university ( topic student ) .",
    "another narrative in the data are requests for and about family ( topics time&family and money2 ) .",
    "this narrative can be identified by the usage of words indicating family relationships like kid , husband , family , mother , wife , and parents ( not all of them are included in the top 15 terms ) .",
    "topic friend stands out since it noticeably worse than any other topic ( 17.0% ) .",
    "it captures requests asking for pizza for a friend that is in town , to cater for parties , or to provide culinary support for a night of movie watching with the girlfriend .",
    "we hypothesize that stories of this topic display little actual need for pizza ( particularly compared to stories talking about money and job problems ) and simply communicate a pizza craving by the requester .",
    "we further recognize that many requests employ previously defined factors such as gratitude ( `` thanks in advance '' in topic gratitude ) , providing pictures as additional evidence , and the intention to `` pay it forward '' .",
    "online platforms have created a new mechanism for people to seek aid from other users .",
    "many online communities such as question & answer sites and online philanthropy communities are created for the express purpose of facilitating this exchange of help .",
    "it is of critical importance to these communities that requests get addressed in an effective and efficient manner .",
    "this presents a clear opportunity to improve these online communities overall as well as improving the chance of success of individual requests .",
    "however , the factors that lead to requests being fulfilled are still largely unknown .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the study of _ how _",
    "one should ask for a favor is often complicated by large effects of _ what _ the requester is actually asking for . we have presented a case study of an online community where all requests ask for the very same contribution , a pizza , thereby naturally controlling for this effect and allowing us to disentangle what is requested from textual and social factors .    drawing from social psychology literature",
    "we extract high - level social features from text that operationalize the relation between recipient and donor and demonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success .",
    "we show that we can detect key narratives automatically that have significant impact on the success of the request .",
    "we further demonstrate that linguistic indications of gratitude , evidentiality , and reciprocity , as well as the high status of the asker , all increase the likelihood of success , while neither politeness nor positive sentiment seem to be associated with success in our setting .",
    "we link these findings to research in psychology on helping behavior ( see table [ table : helping_behavior_link ] ) . for example , our work extends psychological results on offline communities to show that people behave pro - socially in online communities toward requestors who are of high status , display urgency , and who offer to pay it forward .",
    "other novel contributions of our work include the finding that linguistic indications of gratitude lead to pro - social behavior , and the result that higher status users are more likely to demonstrate generalized reciprocity .",
    "our results thus offer new directions for the understanding of pro - social behavior in communities in general , as well as providing a basis for further analysis of success in social media systems .",
    "we must recognize a number of limitations : a shortcoming of any case study is that findings might be specific to the scenario at hand . while we have shown that particular linguistic and social factors differentiate between successful and unsuccessful requests we can not claim a causal relationship between the proposed factors and success that would guarantee success .",
    "furthermore , the set of success factors studied in this work is likely to be incomplete as well and excludes , for instance , group behavior dynamics . despite these limitations , we hope that this work and the data we make available will provide a basis for further research on success factors and helping behavior in other online communities .",
    "we thank christina brandt and jure leskovec for many helpful discussions , niloufar salehi and tuan nguyen for helping with computing user similarity and statistical analysis , and julian mcauley for the original idea to use the raop dataset .",
    "we also thank reddit user `` jimwll '' who generously provided pizza when we most needed it and the anonymous reviewers for their altruistic comments .",
