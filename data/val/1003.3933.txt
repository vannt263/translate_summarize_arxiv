    "fluid turbulence can be described mostly by navier - stokes equations , which consist of partial differential equations in the position space  thus in 2d or 3d space .",

    "the ratio of the dissipation scale to the outer scale is in general determined by a fractional power of the reynolds number .",
    "kinetic turbulence is less well understood .",
    "we have some knowledge especially from the extensive study of fusion plasmas @xcite and recently of space plasmas @xcite , but not to the same extent as fluid turbulence is known , particularly in the sense described above . since most plasmas are in a collisionless or weakly - collisional environment , they are not in local thermodynamical equilibrium . in this case",
    "we have to invoke kinetic description in the phase space , which enables us to use vlasov or boltzmann theory , or their magnetized low - frequency limit , the gyrokinetics .",
    "dissipation in the kinetic system occurs because of collisions . without collisions ,",
    "the entropy is conserved and the system is in principle reversible in a thermodynamic sense @xcite .",
    "wave resonances or landau damping do not by themselves constitute dissipation since no entropy is generated unless we include the effect of collisions .",
    "irreversibility becomes the key issue here .    in this context , the following question arises .",
    "collisions are usually described by a diffusion operator in the _ velocity space _ @xcite .",
    "how do collisions in a weakly collisional system determine the wave - number as well as velocity - space cutoff of the inertial range ?",
    "in this paper , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we show detailed numerical evidence of the coupling between position- and velocity - space structures , and the consequent achievement of the collisional dissipation described by the velocity - space diffusion operator .",
    "we introduce a new dimensionless number @xmath0 , which , analogously to the reynolds number in navier - stokes equations , characterizes the scale separation between the outer scale and the dissipation scale in the kinetic theory .",
    "we emphasize that we are concerned only with scales smaller than the larmor radius .    in order to focus on the nonlinear interaction ,",
    "we omit landau damping by ignoring variation along the field line .",
    "the system retains two collisionless invariants as the 2d navier - stokes equations do .",
    "these two invariants can not share the same local - interaction space in a kolmogorov - like phenomenology , and thus lead to a dual cascade ( direct and inverse cascades ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the direct cascade only and the discussion of the inverse cascade is left for future publication .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . as a reduced kinetic model for plasma turbulence ,",

    "are also briefly summarized .",
    "section [ sec : direct ] shows the evidence of kinetic turbulent cascade by means of the numerical simulation of the decaying turbulence .",
    "in addition to the reproduction of the theoretical prediction , we show how much resolution is needed in both position and velocity space to achieve the proper dissipation and show the trend that the amount of dissipation is asymptotically independent of the collision frequency .",
    "we also present the characteristics of the nonlinear triad interaction in wave - number space and show that the assumption of local - scale interaction is supported .",
    "we finally summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we first introduce the gk model briefly @xcite . since we are going to look at the turbulence in the magnetized plasmas ,",
    "the dynamics of interest is much slower than particles gyromotion .",
    "we may average over the gyromotion and the gyroangle can be ignored due to this gyroaveraging .",
    "a gk system has 3 spatial coordinates ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , and 2 velocity coordinates ( @xmath2 , @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for parallel and perpendicular directions to the background magnetic field .",
    "it is convenient to distinguish between the particle coordinate @xmath9 and the gyrocenter coordinate @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these coordinates are connected by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unit vector along the background magnetic field and @xmath13 is the gyrofrequency .",
    "we further reduce the gk equation into 2d in position space , or 4d in phase space , by ignoring variation along the mean field ( @xmath14 ) .",
