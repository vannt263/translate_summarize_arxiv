    "since the pioneering work of @xcite , astronomers have deduced the physical properties of stars through the combination of spectroscopy and stellar atmosphere models .",
    "different spectral features are sensitive to different stellar atmosphere parameters . the modern approach is to compare an observed stellar spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra calculated over a wide range of parameters .",
    "the most important parameters are effective temperature @xmath3 , surface gravity @xmath4 , and metal abundance [ m / h ] .",
    "once the stellar parameters are constrained , a comparison with evolutionary tracks yields a physical interpretation of the star . consider a spectral a - type , @xmath3  = 8000  k star , which is the focus of this paper . if the star has @xmath4",
    "= 8 , it is a normal hydrogen - atmosphere wd ; if the star has @xmath4",
    "= 4 , it is a normal main sequence a - type star .",
    "but if the star has @xmath4  = 6 , it is something else .    in 2010",
    "we began the elm survey , a spectroscopic survey targeting extremely low mass ( elm ) wd candidates in the range @xmath5 and 8000  k @xmath6 22,000  k @xcite .",
    "elm wds are interesting because they form in ultra - compact binaries ; the universe is not old enough to make them through single - star evolution @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have found and published 76 elm wds in short - period binaries over the past seven years @xcite .",
    "the median binary orbital period is 6 hrs , which means that half of the observed sample will merge within a hubble time .",
    "the merger rate implies that most elm wd binaries will not undergo stable mass transfer or explode as supernovae , but will undergo unstable mass transfer and merge into single massive wds @xcite .    a recent analysis of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra has complicated the picture of elm wds .",
    "@xcite fit pure hydrogen and pure helium atmosphere models to the spectra of candidate wds in sdss , and find thousands of @xmath4  @xmath0 6 objects at @xmath3  @xmath7 9000  k temperatures .",
    "the number of these @xmath4  @xmath0 6 objects is too large , by two orders - of - magnitude , to be explained as the cooler cousins of elm wds found in the elm survey .",
    "yet their surface gravities are too great to be explained as metal - poor main sequence stars .",
    "arguments both for and against the elm wd interpretation appear in conference proceedings @xcite .",
    "kepler and collaborators refer to these objects as subdwarf a ( sda ) spectral - type stars , and their physical interpretation is unclear .",
    "perhaps sda stars are thermally bloated wds , like the class of el  cvn binaries discovered by @xcite .",
    "however thermally bloated wds , which are believed to have recently had their envelopes stripped by companions , are 10 to 100 times lower in luminosity , and 3 to 10 times smaller in radius , than their more massive companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sda stars differ because they _ are _ the primaries : sda stars dominate the light of their systems , and sda stars in the eclipsing binaries presented here have comparable radii to their companions .    in this paper",
    "we address two questions at the base of the sda mystery .",
    "1 ) are we measuring @xmath3  and @xmath4  correctly ? 2 ) are we interpreting @xmath3  and @xmath4  correctly ?    for the published elm survey sample , those objects with @xmath8  k are almost certainly elm wds .",
    "the spectra of these stars are dominated by hydrogen balmer lines , lines shaped by stark broadening and thus sensitive to temperature and gravity at the temperature of b - type stars .",
    "the detached eclipsing binary j0651 proves the point : its radial velocity orbital solution , eclipse light curve , and spectroscopic stellar atmosphere parameters all demonstrate that this is a @xmath9 @xmath2 , @xmath10 @xmath11  elm wd orbiting another wd @xcite .",
    "the same is also true for two additional eclipsing binary systems , galex j1717 + 6757 @xcite and sdss j0751 - 0141 @xcite .",
    "the situation changes between a0 and f0 spectral types at cooler temperatures ( 10,000  k to 7500  k ) where the sda stars are found .",
    "metal line blanketing is important below 10,000  k , and the balmer lines become insensitive to temperature @xcite .",
    "most metals have ionization potentials of 58 ev that are lower than h ( 13.5 ev ) , and so , despite being rare , metals can contribute a significant fraction of electron pressure in the atmosphere of a - type stars @xcite . while we would expect metallicities of a - type main sequence stars to be low ",
    "such stars would be at @xmath010 kpc depths in the halo in our magnitude - limited survey  about one - sixth of a - type stars are chemically peculiar and enhanced in metals @xcite .",
    "helium is a particularly problematic element because its abundance is difficult to measure in a - type spectra .",
    "the ionization potential of he is higher than h , which means he does not add to electron pressure or opacity at a - type temperatures , but it does add to the weight of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of the metal - rich wd gd  362 provides a telling example .",
    "based on low - resolution spectra and pure hydrogen atmosphere models , @xcite derive an erroneously high @xmath12 9.1 for this star .",
    "follow - up high resolution spectroscopy and parallax observations demonstrate that gd  362 has a helium - dominated atmosphere and @xmath12 8.2 @xcite .",
    "yet another complication is that the classic instability strip crosses the main sequence at a- and f - type temperatures .",
    "about one - third of a - type stars are observed to be @xmath13 scuti variables , or sx phe variables if they are metal - poor @xcite .",
    "fitting models to spectra is also complicated by the fact that the blackbody peak moves across the balmer discontinuity at a- and f - type temperatures .",
    "thus there are many reasons to be cautious about deriving the parameters of sda stars .",
    "we constrain the physical nature of sda stars with a three - pronged approach .",
    "first , we compare the observed distributions of wds and sda stars .",
    "second , we fit pure hydrogen models to synthetic main sequence spectra to quantify systematic error in the derived temperature and gravity .",

    "most of the stars in this sample have significant radial velocity variability ; 6 objects have well - measured eclipse light curves ; 5 objects have significant infrared excess .",

    "the eclipsing binaries can not answer that question , because we do not know if the binaries fairly sample the sda population .",

    "what is true across all models is that a magnitude - limited sample contains fewer cool elm wds , because cooler wds are less luminous than hotter wds .",
    "furthermore , a fraction of elm wds must merge with their companions before they cool to @xmath08000  k temperatures .",
    "we account for mergers by assuming that elm wds have formed continuously over the past gyr with the orbital period distribution derived by @xcite .",
    "following the @xcite approach to evolving the elm wd population , the ratio of @xmath105  k to @xmath106  k elm wds in a magnitude - limited sample is about 1:2 averaged over the two sets of evolutionary models .",
    "the elm survey has now obtained a spectrum for every star in sdss in the magnitude range @xmath107 within the elm survey color cut .",
    "while some elm wds must fall outside the color cut , the elm survey provides a robust lower limit on the absolute number of elm wds .",
    "the clean sample of elm wd binaries contains 36 objects with @xmath108  k. assuming that the true absolute number of elm wds in the sdss footprint is a few times larger than the published number , the evolutionary model scaling predicts about 50 elm wds with @xmath109  k in the magnitude range @xmath107 in the sdss footprint .    by comparison , @xcite identify about 2600 sda stars with @xmath105  k and @xmath110 in sdss .",

    "this estimate is consistent with the number of tangential velocity outliers in the sda sample , a completely independent constraint .",

    "the implication is clear : the roche lobe criterion sets a minimum binary orbital period for sda stars 50 times larger than that of elm wds .",
    "the physical nature of sda stars also has implications for studies of pulsating elm wds .",
    "first discovered by @xcite , the first three elm wd pulsators are hotter than 9000  k and are in binary systems with @xmath113 hr to 14.6 hr .",
    "the pulsating elm wd companion to the millisecond pulsar psr j1738 + 0333 has similar properties @xcite .",
    "the temperatures and orbital periods of these pulsators are consistent with being elm wds .",
    "however , the fourth and fifth members of this class of pulsators are cooler than 9000  k and do not show any significant radial velocity variations @xcite . @xcite and @xcite present five additional pulsators with temperatures below 8000  k , and with no evidence of binarity . because pulsations are common in a - type stars , it is possible that these relatively cool pulsators are sx  phe variables , and not pulsating elm wds .",
    "hence , there may be only four likely pulsating elm wds : the three pulsators presented in @xcite and the wd companion to psr j1738 + 0333 @xcite .",
    "measuring the rate of pulsation period change could clarify their stellar nature , because different classes of pulsators have different rates of period change @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate the physical nature of sda stars and their possible link to elm wds .",
    "the distribution of colors and reduced proper motions indicate that sda stars are cooler and more luminous , and thus larger in radius , than published elm wds . we perform a detailed study of sda stars in eclipsing binaries with infrared excess and/or radial velocity orbital solutions .",
    "the joint observational constraints are best explained with binaries containing metal - poor @xmath11.2 @xmath2  main sequence stars with @xmath10.8 @xmath2  companions , not with elm wds .",
    "the source of confusion comes from fitting pure hydrogen models to sda spectra .",
    "metal line blanketing is important below 9000  k , and the balmer lines become insensitive to temperature @xcite . we demonstrate that pure hydrogen model fits to synthetic a - f type spectra yield systematically wrong surface gravities by @xmath01 dex . empirically , surface gravities derived by sspp for a set of sda stars differ by 1.8 dex compared to their pure hydrogen model derived values .",
    "thus sda stars fit with pure hydrogen models appear to be wd imposters .    while it is true that elm wds must exist at sda - like temperatures , they are intrinsically faint and sufficiently rare that we predict about 50 cool elm wds with @xmath107 mag in the sdss survey . thus elm wds comprise of order 1% of the observed sda population .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that surface gravities derived from pure hydrogen models suffer a systematic @xmath01  dex error for sda stars , likely explained by metal line blanketing below 9000  k. a detailed study of five eclipsing binaries with radial velocity orbital solutions and infrared excess establishes that these sda stars are metal - poor @xmath11.2  @xmath2  main sequence stars with @xmath10.8  @xmath2  companions . while wds must exist at sda temperatures , only @xmath01% of a magnitude - limited sda sample should be elm wds . </S>",
