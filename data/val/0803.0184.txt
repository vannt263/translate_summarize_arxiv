    "the physical input to the inverse scattering procedure is the bound - state energy and the phase shift , or something equivalent .",
    "the bound state wave function is square integrable and @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the bound - state energy .",
    "if the potential is of short - range type the scattering wave function at large distances looks like @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the energy and @xmath14 is the phase shift .",

    "the internal part is arbitrary , at least to some extent .    to determine the potential",

    "we may add a third particle to the system .",
    "the third particle feels not only the asymptotic part , but also the whole wave function .",
    "so , three - body observables are sensitive not only to the asymptotic part , but also to the whole two - body wave function . therefore , to determine the potential uniquely",
    ", we need to study both two - body and three - body systems .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a quantum mechanical approximation method which can handle realistic local or nonlocal potentials with long range coulomb tail in two- and three - body dynamics . for this purpose",
    "we developed an integral equation approach . for two - body systems we solve the lippmann - schwinger integral equation , and for three - body systems",
    "we solve the faddeev integral equations . here",
    "we sketch the solution method , the details are given in preceding publications@xcite .",
    "an argument against using nonlocal potentials is that it is too general and by using them we open a `` pandora s box '' .",
    "however , we often have some information about the internal structure of the composite particles which provides some framework for the nature of the nonlocality .",
    "composite particles often made of identical elementary fermions . if two composite particles gets closer , the pauli principle prevent the identical constituents from occupying the same quantum state .",
    "this is the main source of the nonlocality of the interaction at short distances .",
    "there are several cluster model inspired effective potentials which has nonlocal parts .",
    "probably the most general and best founded model is the fish - bone model @xcite .",
    "this approach takes into account not only the complete pauli blocking , but also it allows that some states are partly pauli forbidden or pauli suppressed .    in this work",
    "we examine the @xmath0 interaction in the fish - bone model .",
    "we determine the @xmath0 potential such that it reproduces the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 wave phase shifts up to @xmath18 mev , the famous the @xmath19 kev , @xmath20 @xmath0 resonant state , and the three-@xmath1 binding energy .    in sec .",

    "iii we extend the method for solving the faddeev integral equations of the three - body problem@xcite .",
    "the faddeev equations with coulomb potentials are rather complicated , so we restrict ourself to bound states and identical particles . then , in sec .",
    "iv , we reexamine the two-@xmath1 and the three-@xmath1 system and determine a new fish - bone - type @xmath0 potential which provides a good description to the two-@xmath1 and three-@xmath1 observables .",
    "in this section we recapitulate the solution of the lippmann  schwinger equation by using the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion method .",
    "we suppose that the total hamiltonian @xmath21 can be split into two terms @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an asymptotically irrelevant short - range potential and @xmath24 is the coulomb hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath4 is the reduced mass , @xmath5 is the angular momentum and @xmath26 is the strength of the coulomb potential .",
    "we denote the coulomb green s operator by @xmath27 and the green s operator of the total hamiltonian by @xmath28 .",
    "they are related via the resolvent relation @xmath29 the scattering wave function @xmath30 satisfies the inhomogeneous lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation @xmath31 while the bound- and resonant - state wave function satisfies the homogeneous lippmann  schwinger equation @xmath32 at negative real and complex @xmath13 energies , respectively .",
    "we solve these equations in a unified way by approximating only the short range potential @xmath23 .",
    "we use coulomb - sturmian ( cs ) functions @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the laguerre polynomial .",
    "the cs functions form a bi - orthonormal basis . with @xmath35",
    "we have @xmath36 to approximate the potential operator we use a  skew  form of the completeness relation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "it is obvious that this double sum is also a possible expression for unity .",
    "if @xmath40 , eq .   ( [ 1n ] ) falls back to the usual completeness relation . by adopting different values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 one can achieve a faster convergence in the separable approximation@xcite .    in eqs .",
    "( [ ls ] ) and ( [ ls1 ] ) the term @xmath43 is square integrable , and belongs to the hilbert space .",
    "therefore , it can be approximated by @xmath44 with finite @xmath45 , where @xmath46 in general , the matrix elements @xmath47 have to be calculated numerically .",
    "note that the potential is sandwiched between cs states with parameter @xmath48 and the potential operator becomes a linear combination of cs ket - bra operators @xmath49 .",
    "this approximation is called separable expansion because the potential operator after approximation appears in the form @xmath50 i.e.   the dependence on @xmath51 and @xmath52 is separated .    with this separable potential eqs .",
    "( [ ls ] ) and ( [ ls1 ] ) become @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively . to derive equations for the unknown coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we have to act with states @xmath57 from the left .",
    "then , the following inhomogeneous and homogeneous algebraic equations are obtained for scattering and bound - state problems , respectively : @xmath58\\underline{\\psi}_l^{(+)}= ( \\underline{g}^{\\rm c}_l ( e + { \\rm i}0))^{-1 } \\underline{\\varphi}_l^{\\rm c } ,   \\label{eq18a}\\ ] ] and @xmath59\\underline{\\psi } _",

    "the reason that we have adopted the cs basis is that , in that basis , these quantities can be calculated analytically@xcite .",
    "the homogeneous equation ( [ eq18b ] ) is solvable if and only if @xmath62=0\\ ] ] holds , which is an implicit nonlinear equation for the bound- and resonant - state energies . as far as the scattering states are concerned",
    ", the solution of ( [ eq18a ] ) provides the overlap @xmath63 . from this quantity",
    "any scattering information can be inferred , for example the coulomb - modified scattering amplitude reads @xmath64 which is related to the coulomb - modified short - range phase shift @xmath65 through @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the coulomb phase shift .    in this approach",
    ", the potential enters into the procedure through its cs matrix elements .",
    "so , the method works for any potential , local or nonlocal , energy dependent , complex , etc .",
    ", as long as we can evaluate its cs matrix elements somehow .",
    "numerical examples show that the method is also very efficient@xcite . having the optimal values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , one need about @xmath68 basis states to achieve @xmath69 digits accuracy for the bound state energies and for the phase shifts over the entire spectrum .",
    "here we consider three identical particles interacting with repulsive coulomb - like potentials and we restrict ourself to bound states .",
    "the method is applicable also for attractive coulomb potentials and for scattering and resonant states as well@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the three - body kinetic energy operator and @xmath72 denotes the long - range coulomb - like potential of each subsystem @xmath73 .",
    "we use the usual configuration - space jacobi coordinates : @xmath74 is the distance between the pair @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the distance between the center of mass of the pair @xmath75 and the particle @xmath77 .",
    "a coulomb potential modifies the character of the asymptotic motion , therefore it should be treated very much like the kinetic energy operator .",
    "we split the potential into two parts , a short - range and a coulomb part @xmath78 we define the long - range hamiltonian by @xmath79 and the three - body hamiltonian takes the form @xmath80 this hamiltonian looks like an ordinary three - body hamiltonian with short - range interactions .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation @xmath81 by using the faddeev method .",
    "we split the wave function into three components @xmath82 @xmath83    where @xmath84 . by adding these three equations we get back the original schrdinger equation .    by inverting the left hand side of ( [ fm3compd ] )",
    "we get a set of integral eqautions    [ fm2comp ] @xmath85    where @xmath86 .",
    "if particles @xmath77 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are identical , then @xmath89 , in its natural jacobi coordinate system @xmath90 , looks like @xmath91 in its natural jacobi coordinate system @xmath92 and @xmath93 in its natural jacobi coordinate system @xmath94 . on the other hand , by interchanging particles @xmath87 and @xmath88 we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 for bosons and @xmath97 for fermions . building this information into the formalism we arrive at a single integral equation @xmath98 is the operator for cyclic permutation of all three particles @xmath99 .",
    "we should notice that so far no approximation has been made , and even though this integral equation has only one component , yet it gives a full account for the asymptotic and symmetry properties of the system .",
    "since the three - body hilbert space is a direct product of two - body hilbert spaces , an appropriate basis is the bipolar basis , which can be defined as an angular - momentum - coupled direct product of the two - body bases , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are associated with the coordinates @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively . with this basis",
    "the completeness relation takes the form ( with angular momentum summation implicitly included ) @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "similarly to the two - body case , @xmath107 is square integrable , therefore we can approximate @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "the completeness of the cs basis guarantees the convergence of the expansion with increasing @xmath45 and angular momentum channels .",
    "now , by applying the bra @xmath110 on eq .",
    "( [ fmp ] ) from the left , the solution of the homogeneous faddeev equation turns into the solution of a matrix equation for the component vector @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 this homogeneous algebraic equation is solvable if only if the determinant is zero : @xmath114 = 0 . \\label{homdet}\\ ] ]    the operator @xmath115 is the resolvent of a complicated three - body coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian , however can support only one kind of asymptotic channel , when particles @xmath87 and @xmath88 are close and particle @xmath77 is at infinity .",
    "the asymptotic hamiltonian of @xmath116 is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the channel coulomb potential .",
    "this potential is the asymptotic part of @xmath119 as particle @xmath77 is separated from the pair @xmath75 .",
    "it looks like the charges of particles @xmath87 and @xmath88 are concentrated in their center of mass @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the charge of the particles .    for hamiltonians which have one kind of asymptotic hamiltonian , a single lippmann - schwinger equation provides a unique solution .",
    "thus @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 . to solve the faddeev equation",
    ", we need @xmath125 between finite number of square integrable cs basis states .",
    "we make a separable approximation on @xmath126 , and with the help of matrix elements @xmath127 , we get @xmath128 where @xmath129 this later matrix element of @xmath126 can always be evaluated numerically .    to calculate the matrix elements",
    "@xmath130 we utilize the dunford - taylor functional calculus .",
    "if @xmath131 is a selfadjoint operator , then an analytic function @xmath132 of @xmath131 is given by a contour integral @xmath133 where the contour @xmath134 goes around the spectrum of @xmath131 such that @xmath132 is analytic on the area encircled by @xmath134 .",
    "the three - particle free hamiltonian can be written as a sum of two - particle free hamiltonians @xmath135 thus the hamiltonian @xmath136 of eq .",
    "( [ htilde ] ) appears as a sum of two two - body hamiltonians acting on different coordinates @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which , of course , commute .",
    "the green s operator @xmath140 is a function of the selfadjoint operator @xmath141 .",
    "so , @xmath142 i.e.  we can calculate the three - body resolvent as a convolution integral of two - body resolvent operators .    in this work we concentrate on bound states of the three-@xmath1 system .",
    "therefore @xmath143 , @xmath141 is a repulsive coulomb hamiltonian , and although @xmath144 contains a short - range potential , it does not support bound states .",
    "figure i shows the analytic structure on the integrand ( [ contourint ] ) and the contour which encircles the spectrum of @xmath141 without penetrating into the spectrum of @xmath144 . in fig .",
    "ii the contour @xmath134 is deformed analytically .",
    "this is a more advantageous contour for numerical calculations since the matrix elements of green s operators falls off quickly and smoothly in this complex imaginary direction .    ) . if @xmath143 , the two branch - cuts are well separated .",
    "the contour @xmath134 goes around the spectrum of @xmath141 without penetrating into the spectrum of @xmath144.[f1],width=377 ]    , width=377 ]",
    "two- and three-@xmath1 systems have been subject to a very intensive study over the past decades .",
    "we just refer here to some recent investigations ranging from local plus three - body potential models@xcite , through orthogonality condition model@xcite , to genuine resonating group calculations@xcite .",
    "the  standard model  for the @xmath0 interaction is the ali - bodmer potential@xcite .",
    "there are various parameterizations but , in general , in this model , the potential is local and partial - wave dependent .",
    "we use the parametrization @xmath145 which is shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the potential has a very strong angular momentum dependence .",
    "potential for @xmath20 , @xmath146 and @xmath147.[f3],width=453 ]    table i shows the binding energy of the three-@xmath1 system with total angular momentum @xmath148 as a function of maximal subsystems angular momenta @xmath149 .",
    "we used cs function up to @xmath150 , which provided us with about five digits accuracy .",
    "if we take the @xmath151 angular momentum channel only , we do not get binding .",
    "we can also see that angular momentum channels @xmath152 have very little contributions to the binding energy .",
    "the experimental binding energy of the three-@xmath1 ( @xmath153 ) system is @xmath154 mev , so the ali - bodmer potential does not provide enough binding .",
    "the fish - bone model is motivated by the cluster model . in the resonating group model",
    "the total wave function is an antisymmetrized product of the cluster @xmath155 and the inter - cluster @xmath156 relative states @xmath157 the state @xmath155 , which is supposed to be known in this model , describes the internal properties of the clusters , including spin and isospin structure .",
    "the unknown relative motion state @xmath156 is determined from the variational anzatz @xmath158 this anzatz results in a rather complicated equation for @xmath156 , which were possible to solve only by using serious approximations on @xmath155 and on the interaction of the particles . based on this resonating group cluster model",
    ", several models has been proposed to describe the motion and interaction of composite particles .",
    "probably the most elaborated one is the fish - bone optical model proposed by schmid@xcite .    in the fish - bone model",
    "the interaction of the two - body subsystem is given by @xmath159 where @xmath5 refers to partial wave , @xmath160 is the kinetic energy and @xmath161 is a local potential .",
    "the states @xmath162 are eigenstates of the norm operator , @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the center of mass distance of the two clusters . if the relative motion is forbidden by pauli principle then @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath167 eigenvalues are ordered such that @xmath168 .",
    "the matrix @xmath169 is then given by @xmath170^{1/2 } } , & \\text{if $ i \\le j$ } , \\\\",

    "j$ } ,   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath171 if @xmath166 and @xmath172 otherwise . or , in matrix form , if we have one pauli forbidden state , @xmath173 which exhibits a fish - bone - like structure , where the name of the model comes from . in this model",
    "the pauli - forbidden states become eigenstates at @xmath10 energy . by choosing @xmath10 as large positive ,",
    "they become bound states at large positive energy , and thus disappear from the physically relevant part of the spectrum .",
    "there are several versions of the fish - bone model which differ in off - shell transformations , i.e.  in transformations which effect the internal part of the wave function and leave the asymptotic part , and the spectrum , unchanged .",
    "this version of the model minimizes the three - body potential , which is therefore neglected .",
    "we assume that in the @xmath1 particles the nucleons are in @xmath174 states in an oscillator well of width parameter @xmath175",
    ". then the norm kernel eigenvalues are also harmonic oscillator functions with the same width parameter and the eigenvalues are known@xcite : @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "so , in the @xmath20 relative motion channel there are two pauli - forbidden states , in @xmath146 there is one , an in @xmath147 and higher channels there are none .",
    "the decreasing value of @xmath179 indicates that those harmonic oscillator sates in the relative motion are less and less suppressed by the pauli principle . for the @xmath10 parameter of the fish - bone model , which aim",
    "is to remove the pauli - forbidden states , we took @xmath180 mev . in this range of @xmath10 ,",
    "the dependence of the results was beyond the fifth significant digit .",
    "in an earlier work by kircher and schmid@xcite a fish - bone - type potential was determined from two-@xmath1 scattering data .",
    "the width parameter was fixed to @xmath181 and the the local potential was given by @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "while this potential provides a reasonably good fit to @xmath20 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 partial wave phase shifts , it seriously overbinds the three-@xmath1 system ( see fb-1 in table i ) .",
    "one may conclude that there is a need for three - body potential .",
    "this was the choice oryu and kamada@xcite adopted .",
    "they added a phenomenological three - body potential to the fish - bone potential of kircher and schmid and found that a huge three - body potential is needed to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "but , our faddeev calculations reveal that the @xmath147 partial wave is very important to the three-@xmath1 binding and , for this partial wave , the fit to experimental data is not so stellar .",
    "so we concluded , that it may be possible to improve the agreement in the @xmath147 partial wave and achieve a better description for the three-@xmath1 binding energy .",
    "as a local potential we took two gaussians plus screened coulomb potential @xmath185 where @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath175 are fitting parameters . in the fitting procedure we incorporated the famous @xmath190 , @xmath20 resonance state at @xmath191 mev , the @xmath192 three-@xmath1 ground state energy @xmath193 mev , and the @xmath20 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 low energy phase shifts . with parameters",
    "@xmath194 mev , @xmath195 , @xmath196 mev , @xmath197 and @xmath198 we achieved a perfect fit . for the @xmath20 two - body resonance state",
    "we get @xmath199 mev , and for the three - body ground state @xmath200 mev .",
    "the fit to the phase shifts is shown on fig 4 .",
    "we can see that the fit could hardly be any better .",
    "fig 5 shows the local part of the fish - bone potential .",
    "notice that unlike with the ali - bodmer potential , we achieved this agreement by using the same potential in all partial waves .    ,",
    "@xmath146 and @xmath147 phase shifts.[f4],width=453 ]    .[f5],width=453 ]    having this new @xmath0 fish - bone potential from the fitting procedure , we also calculated the first excited state of the three-@xmath1 system .",
    "this state is a resonant state , and we got @xmath201 mev , which is again very close to the experimental value .",
    "in order that we can incorporate the pauli effect we have to leave the local potential models and have to use nonlocal potentials .",
    "we solved the underlying lippmann - schwinger and faddeev integral equations by performing a separable expansion of the potential in coulomb - sturmian basis .",
    "this expansion scheme can handle practically any kind of coulomb plus nonlocal short - range potentials .",
    "the faddeev equations have a further advantage that they allow a very detailed channel - by - channel analysis of the interaction .",
    "the method is also very efficient numerically . to solve",
    "the faddeev equation for five angular momentum channels takes a few minutes on our mac pc , and to fit the fish - bone potential parameters took a couple of hours .",
    "we believe that we possess the right model and appropriate tools for investigating the interaction of composite particles .",
    "it is truly remarkable that we got a unified description of the two-@xmath1 @xmath20 resonant state and the @xmath20 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 phase shifts , as well as the three-@xmath1 binding energy .",
    "this was achieved without resorting to three - body potentials and adding explicit angular momentum dependence to the local potential .",
    "the results show that the angular momentum dependence comes form the pauli effect .",
    "if the pauli effect is properly incorporated , like in the fish - bone model , and the fit is done in such a way that both two- and three - body data are incorporated , there is no need for additional angular momentum dependence and there is no room for a strong three - body potential .",
    "we can see that the proper inclusion of the pauli principle simplifies the model potential of composite particles .",
