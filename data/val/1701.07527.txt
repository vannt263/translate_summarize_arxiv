    "this suggests that the halo mass evolution plays a key role in the two - phase scenario of massive galaxy formation in which in situ star formation rapidly increases the galaxy stellar mass at early epochs and mergers gradually build it up by @xmath7  @xcite .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the specific mass growth rates of the main progenitors in the previous section indicate how the galaxies chosen at @xmath7 have evolved over time . thus , figure  [ ssfr_ssar0 ] is plotted based on a theoretical viewpoint .",
    "however , observations take a snapshot of the galaxies located at various redshifts . in that sense ,",
    "figure  [ ssfr_ssar1 ] displays the specific mass growth rates of galaxies binned by mass at each epoch .",
    "the more massive galaxies or the centrals of more massive haloes have higher ssars and lower ssfrs . at a fixed stellar mass , the ssfrs decay by two orders of magnitude during cosmic time , as shown in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "cluster - scale haloes ( @xmath21 ) and very massive galaxies ( @xmath8 ) begin to appear at @xmath94 in the co - moving volume of this study .",
    "the ssfrs of the most massive groups are comparable to those of less massive groups for a while after emerging in all the panels .",
    "the ssfrs are sufficiently high at the moment to increase the stellar mass by a factor of two within a billion years . in our model , galaxies in the most massive ranges at early epochs",
    "have been built up by very active star formation , along with galaxy mergers .",
    "rapid halo mass growth leads to violent baryonic accretion into the central regions , eventually inducing very high star formation activities .",
    "however , the most massive groups quickly experience a rapid drop in the ssfrs in all the panels .",
    "the central galaxies of the haloes in @xmath84 of panel ( a ) are in the merger - dominant phase most of the time after they appear in all the panels .",
    "the differences between the ssfrs and the ssars increase in the massive halo groups as cold gas is depleted and cooling is further suppressed by feedback . in the middle panel ,",
    "the two mass growth channels are almost equally important for the second massive group of centrals ( @xmath95 ) all the time . in this panel ,",
    "0.5 dex more massive central galaxies have ssars 0.5 dex higher at @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , a ten times larger stellar mass falls into 0.5 dex more massive galaxies via mergers .",
    "star formation contributes an order of magnitude more to mass growth than mergers in @xmath97 .",
    "the specific mass growth rates of satellites ( panel ( c ) ) are always lower than those of centrals .",
    "environmental effects cause overall low ssfrs .",
    "since satellite galaxies are hardly involved in mergers with other satellites , their ssars are at least an order of magnitude lower than those of the centrals .",
    "therefore , mergers do not become primary mass growth channels in all groups . in our model",
    ", galaxy mergers between satellites mainly occur in sub groups that belong to host haloes that are not yet virialized .",
    "once the sub groups are dynamically dissociated in dense environments , their member galaxies only fall into the central regions of their host haloes in our model .",
    "examined the assembly history of stellar components in galaxies as a function of final stellar mass using semi - analytic approaches . here",
    "we expand in a cosmological context by investigating it in terms of extended parameter spaces using a larger cosmological volume simulation .",
    "the size and resolution of the volume were designed to cover a wide range of halo masses @xmath98 . the fiducial model of this study",
    "was calibrated to fit a set of empirical data .",
    "we labelled the stars formed along the main branches of halo merger trees as in situ components and the rest of the stars falling into galaxies via mergers as ex situ components .",
    "the @xmath0cdm cosmology predicts earlier formation of primordial structures in denser environments and their hierarchical assembly over time . in this framework ,",
    "the formation and assembly of galaxies are expected to correlate with the evolution of halo environments . in our model",
    ", we found that centrals of more massive haloes have older formation times and higher ex situ fractions .",
    "the marginal distribution of the ex situ fractions at @xmath7 gradually increases with increasing halo mass .",
    "the ex situ components become the majority in the stellar mass of the central galaxies in @xmath84",
    ". however , the distribution of ex situ fractions sharply rises in terms of stellar mass with large dispersion in @xmath77 .",
    "this is because the central galaxies at @xmath2 are hosted by a wide range of halo mass @xmath78 . as a result",
    ", they have similar masses despite their diverse evolution tracks .",
    "satellite galaxies have slightly lower ex situ fractions than centrals but the overall trend is similar .",
    "like massive centrals , massive satellites acquired a considerable fraction of their stellar mass via mergers mainly when they were centrals and have only recently become satellites .",
    "the marginal distribution of the ex situ fractions evolves with decreasing redshifts .",
    "the centrals of the most massive haloes already reach @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "the ex situ fraction rapidly increases as the galaxy stellar mass begins to exceed @xmath2 .",
    "this can be interpreted to suggest that galaxy mergers are essential for building up galaxies above @xmath2 , whether they end up becoming centrals or satellites .",
    "we examined the time evolution of the specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) and specific stellar mass accretion rates ( ssars ) .",
    "first , we traced the specific growth rates of the main progenitors of the galaxies grouped by final halo or stellar mass .",
    "the ssfrs of the main progenitors are always lower in more massive groups while the ssars behave in the opposite manner . in very early epochs ,",
    "the ssfrs far exceed the ssars in all galaxies , but this dominance rapidly decreases over time .",
    "furthermore , the ssfrs decay even faster for more massive galaxies , which results in a crossing of the two mass growth channels in some cases .",
    "the transition takes place in the main progenitors of the central galaxies that finally reside in the haloes of @xmath84 . in our model",
    ", this is the mass range where the two phase scenario for massive early types  @xcite is valid . with the aforementioned results",
    ", this suggests that the correlation between the stellar mass and the empirical galaxy formation time  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the fraction of ex situ components proposed by theoretical studies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be merely the projection of their intrinsic halo mass dependence upon the stellar - to - halo mass relation .",
    "when we looked into the ssar and ssfr evolution of galaxies in an empirical sense , i.e. binning them by given mass ranges at each epoch with no use of progenitor - descendant relations , we found that mergers are a major channel for mass growth at all times in the centrals of @xmath77 or the centrals of haloes with @xmath84 .",
    "however , in satellites , mergers are secondary or even negligible .",
    "this study displayed a strong correlation between the formation and assembly of galaxies and halo mass which only represents local environments .",
    "in large scales , however , weaker correlations have been found .",
    "@xcite compared the empirical luminosity function of void galaxies with their sam , concluding that large - scale environments do not significantly affect galaxy properties but halo mass assembly is a decisive factor in galaxy evolution .",
    "@xcite also presented a similar result using ysam  that galaxy growth rates are largely insensitive to large - scale environments .",
    "so , in sum , the evolution of local halo environments plays a leading role in the formation and assembly of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "central galaxies in dense environments grow with vigorous gas inflow at early epochs and the steady mergers of small structures over time .",
    "some galaxies achieve @xmath2 even in low density environments with active in situ star formation , but they come up against a steep barrier to growing further without mergers . once galaxies are relegated to satellite status , in situ star formation becomes the dominant channel for increasing mass despite the gradual suppression of star formation activities due to environmental effects .",
    "galaxy formation models are , of course , incomplete as yet and are unable to precisely describe the formation of stellar mass  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , the success of the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmology gives credibility to the efforts to understand galaxy mass assembly , which is regarded as a consequential process of structure formation in the cosmological framework .",
    "this study demonstrates that similarly massive galaxies have a variety of evolution histories , depending on their halo environments .",
    "meanwhile , empirical studies have found a considerable number of luminous galaxies in low density environments as well as dense environments  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . motivated by these results",
