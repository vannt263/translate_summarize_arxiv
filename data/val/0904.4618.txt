    "molecular modeling and simulation is a powerful tool for predicting thermophysical properties , that is becoming more accesible due to the ever increasing computing power and the progress of methods and simulation tools . for real life applications in process engineering reliable predictions",
    "are needed for a wide variety of properties @xcite .    the central role for that task",
    "is played by the molecular model , that determines all of them .",
    "therefore , a balanced modeling procedure , i.e. selection of model type and parameterization , is crucial .",
    "unfortunately , thermophysical properties usually depend on the model parameters in a highly non - linear fashion .",
    "so the development of new molecular models of technical quality is a time - consuming task . in this paper",
    "a procedure is proposed that uses information from _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical calculations to accelerate the modeling process . as an example , ammonia is regarded here .",
    "ammonia is a well - known chemical intermediate , mostly used in fertilizer industries ; another important application is its use as a refrigerant . due to its simple symmetric structure and its strong intermolecular interactions",
    "it is also of high academic interest both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "different approaches can be found in the literature to construct an intermolecular potential for ammonia to be used in molecular simulation .",
    "jorgensen and ibrahim @xcite as well as hinchliffe et al .",
    "@xcite used experimental bond distances and angles to place their interaction sites .",
    "jorgensen and ibrahim fitted a 12 - 6 - 3 potential plus four partial charges to results from _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical calculations , they derived for 250 orientations of the ammonia dimer using the sto-3 g minimal basis set . to yield reasonable potential energies for liquid ammonia compared to experimental results , they had to scale their potential by a factor 1.26 .",
    "hinchliffe et al . used a combination of exponential repulsion terms , an attractive morse potential , and four partial charges to construct the intermolecular potential .",
    "the parameters were determined by fitting to a total of 61 points on the ammonia dimer energy surface at seven different orientations , which were calculated using the 6 - 31 g * basis set .",
    "hinchliffe et al . have pointed out , that the parameterization is ambiguous concerning the selection of dimer configurations and the used interaction potentials .",
    "also the different models perform different well on various properties .    in a later work impey and",
    "klein @xcite reparameterized the molecular model by hinchliffe et al .",
    "they switched to an `` effective '' pair potential using one lennard - jones ( 12 - 6 ) potential at the nitrogen nucleus site to describe the dispersive and repulsive interactions .",
    "the parameters were optimized to the radial distribution function @xmath1 of liquid ammonia measured by narten @xcite .",
    "kristf et al .",
    "@xcite used this model to predict vapor - liquid equilibrium properties and found systematic deviations in both vapor pressure and saturated densities .",
    "so they decided to develop a completely new molecular model .",
    "again they used experimental bond distances and angles to place the interaction sites .",
    "all further parameters of their model , i.e. the partial charges on all atoms and the parameters of the single lennard - jones ( 12 - 6 ) potential , were adjusted to vapor - liquid coexistence properties . with this model kristf et al .",
    "reached a description of the vapor - liquid equilibrium ( vle ) of ammonia of reasonable accuracy .    for their simulations ,",
    "kristf et al . used the gibbs ensemble monte carlo ( gemc ) technique @xcite with an extension to the @xmath2 ensemble @xcite .",
    "this methods have some difficulties simulating strongly interacting fluids , yielding to relatively large statistical uncertainties .",
    "when applying our methods for the simulation of vle , leading to much smaller statistical errors , we get results slightly outside the error bars of kristf et al . also systematic deviations to the experimental vapor - liquid properties are seen , especially in the vapor pressure and critical temperature , cf . figures  [ fig_vle_rho ] to [ fig_vle_dhv ] .    in the present work a new molecular model for ammonia",
    "is proposed .",
    "this model is based on the work of kristf et al . and improved by including data on geometry and electrostatics from _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : initially , a procedure is proposed for the development of a preliminary molecular model .",
    "this model , called _ first model _ in the following , is then adjusted to experimental vle data until a desired quality is reached .",
    "the resulting model , denoted as _",
    "new model _ in the following , is used afterwards to predict thermal and caloric properties apart from the phase coexistence as well as structural properties .",
    "the modeling philosophy followed here is to keep the molecular model as simple as possible .",
    "therefore , the molecule is assumed rigid and non - polarizable , i.e. a single state - independent set of parameters is used .",
    "hydrogen atoms are not modeled explicitely , a united - atom approach is used .    for both present models ,",
    "a single lennard - jones potential was assumed to describe the dispersive and repulsive interactions .",
    "the electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding were modeled by a total of four partial charges .",
    "this modeling approach was found to be appropriate for other hydrogen bonding fluids like methanol @xcite , ethanol @xcite , and formic acid @xcite and was also followed by impey and klein @xcite and kristf et al .",
    "@xcite for ammonia .",
    "thus , the potential energy @xmath3 between two ammonia molecules @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by    @xmath6 + \\sum_{a=1}^4\\sum_{b=1}^4 \\frac{q_{ia}q_{jb}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0r_{ijab}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the site index of charges on molecule @xmath4 and @xmath8 the site index of charges on molecule @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the site - site distances between molecules @xmath4 and @xmath5 are denoted by @xmath9 for the single lennard - jones potential and @xmath10 for the four partial charges , respectively . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the lennard - jones size and energy parameters , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the partial charges located at the sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the molecules @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath15 denotes the permittivity of the vacuum .    to keep the modeling procedure as independent as possible from the availability of specific information , no experimental bond lengths or angles",
    "were used here in contrast to @xcite . instead",
    ", the nucleus positions were calculated by the means of quantum mechanics , where the software package gamess ( us ) @xcite was used .",
    "a geometry optimization was performed on the hartree - fock , i.e.  self - consistent field ( scf ) , level using the basis set 6 - 31 g , which is a split - valence orbital basis set without polarizable terms .",
    "the nucleus positions from this _ ab initio _ calculation were directly used to specifiy the positions of the five interaction sites . at the nitrogen nucleus site and at each of the hydrogen nucleus sites",
    "a partial charge was placed .",
    "the lennard - jones site conincides with the nitrogen nucleus position , cf .",
    "table  [ tab_parameter ] .    to obtain the magnitude of the partial charges , another subsequent quantum mechanical calculation was performed .",
    "it was done on mller - plesset 2 level using the polarizable basis set 6 - 311g(d , p ) and the geometry from the previous step . by default ,",
    "quantum mechanical calculations are performed on a single molecule of interest in vacuum .",
    "it is widely known , that the gas phase dipolar moments significantly differ from the dipole moment in the liquid state .",
    "as it was seen from former work @xcite , molecular models yield better results on vle properties , when a `` liquid - like '' dipolar moment is applied .",
    "therefore , the single molecule was calculated within a dielectric cavity utilizing the cosmo ( conducter like screening model ) method @xcite to mimic the liquid state .",
    "the partial charges were chosen to yield the resulting dipole moment of @xmath16  debye , the parameters are given in table  [ tab_parameter ] .",
    "the first model combines this electrostatics with the lennard - jones parameters of kristf et al @xcite , so no additional experimental data was used . to achieve an optimized new model , the two lennard - jones parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "were adjusted to experimental saturated liquid density , vapor pressure , and enthalpy of vaporization using a newton scheme as proposed by stoll @xcite .",
    "these properties were chosen for the adjustment as they all represent major characteristics of the fluid region .",
    "furthermore , they are relatively easy to be measured and are available for many components of technical interest .",
    "the applied optimization method has many similarities with the one proposed by ungerer et al .",
    "@xcite and later on modified by bourasseau et al .",
    "it relies on a least - square minimiztion of a weighted fitness function @xmath17 that quantifies the devitions of simulation results from a given molecular model compared to experimental data .",
    "the weighted fitness function writes as    @xmath18    wherein the @xmath19-dimensional vector @xmath20 is a short - cut notation for the set of @xmath19 model parameters @xmath21 to be optimized .",
    "the deviations of results from simulation @xmath22 to experimental data @xmath23 are weighted with the expected simulation uncertainties @xmath24 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq_fitness ] ) allows simultaneous adjustment of the model parameters to different thermophysical properties @xmath25 ( saturated liquid densities @xmath26 , vapor pressures @xmath27 , and enthalpies of vaporization @xmath28 at various temperatures in the present work ) .",
    "the unknown functional dependence of the property @xmath25 on the model parameters is approximated by a first order taylor series developed in the vicinity of the initial parameter set @xmath29    @xmath30    therein , the partial derivatives of @xmath31 with respect to each model parameter @xmath32 , i.e. the sensitivities , are calculated from difference quotients    @xmath33    assuming a sound choice of the model parameter variations @xmath34 , i.e. small enough to ensure linearity and large enough to yield differences in the simulation results significantly above the statistical uncertainties , this method allows a step - wise optimization of the molecular model by minimization of the fitness function @xmath17 .",
    "experience shows that an optimized set of model parameters can be found within a few steps when starting from a reasonable initial model .",
    "vle results for the new model are compared to data obtained from a reference quality equation of state ( eos ) @xcite in figures  [ fig_vle_rho ] to [ fig_vle_dhv ] .",
    "these figures also include the results , that we calculated using the first model and the model from kristf et al . @xcite .",
    "the present numerical simulation results together with experimental data @xcite are given in table  [ tab_vle ] , technical simulation details are given in the appendix .",
    "the reference eos @xcite used for adjustment and comparison here , was optimized to @xmath0 experimental data sets .",
    "it is based on two older eos from the late nineteen seventies @xcite and also recommended by the nist within their reference eos database refprop @xcite .",
    "the proposed uncertainties of the equation of state are 0.2  % in density , 2  % in heat capacity , and 2  % in the speed of sound , except in the critical region .",
    "the uncertainty in vapor pressure is 0.2  % .    the model of kristf et al .",
    "shows noticeable deviations from experimental data .",
    "the mean unsigned errors over the range of vle are 1.9  % in saturated liquid density , 13  % in vapor pressure and 5.1  % in enthalpy of vaporization . even without any further adjustment to experimental data",
    "a better description was found using the first model .",
    "the deviations between simulation results and reference eos are 1.5  % in saturated liquid density , 10.4  % in vapor pressure and 5.1  % in enthalpy of vaporization .    with the new model a significant improvement",
    "is achieved compared to the model from kristf et al .",
    "the description of the experimental vle is very good , the mean unsigned deviations in saturated liquid density , vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization are 0.7 , 1.6 , and 2.7  % , respectively . only at low temperatures , in the range of ambient pressure , a slightly worse description of the vapor pressure compared to the first model is observed . in figure  [ fig_vle_dev ] the relative deviations of the new model , the model from kristf et al .",
    ", and the first model are shown in the whole range of the vle starting from triple point to critical point .",
    "mathews @xcite gives experimental critical values of temperature , density and pressure for ammonia : @xmath35405.65  k , @xmath3613.8  mol / l , and @xmath3711.28  mpa .",
    "following the procedure suggested by lotfi et al .",
    "@xcite the critical properties @xmath35395.82  k , @xmath3614.0  mol / l , and @xmath3711.26  mpa for the model of kristf et al .",
    "were calculated , where the critical temperature is underestimated by 2.4  % .",
    "for the first model @xmath35403.99  k ,",
    "@xmath3614.1  mol / l , and @xmath3711.67  mpa were obtained and for the new model @xmath35402.21  k ,",
    "@xmath3613.4  mol / l , and @xmath3710.52  mpa .",
    "the latter two give reasonable results for the critical temperature , while the new model underpredicts the critical pressure slightly .",
    "in many technical applications thermodynamic properties in the homogeneous fluid region apart from the vle are needed .",
    "thus , the new molecular model was tested on its predictive capabilities in these states .",
    "thermal and caloric properties were predicted with the new model in the homogenous liquid , vapor and supercritical fluid region . in total , 70 state points were regarded , covering a large range of states with temperatures up to 700  k and pressures up to 700  mpa . in figure",
    "[ fig_hom_rho ] , relative deviations between simulation and reference eos @xcite in terms of density are shown .",
    "the deviations are typically below 3  % with the exception of the extended critical region , where a maximum deviation of 6.8  % is found .",
    "figure  [ fig_hom_h ] presents relative deviations in terms of enthalpy between simulation and reference eos @xcite . in this case deviations",
    "are very low for low pressures and high temperatures ( below 12  % ) .",
    "typical deviations in the other cases are below 5  % .",
    "these results confirm the modeling procedure . by adjustment to vle data only , quantitatively correct predictions in most of the technically important fluid region can be obtained .",
    "the virial expansion gives an equation of state for low density gases . for ammonia",
    "it is a good approximation for gaseous states below 0.1  mpa with a maximum error of 2.5  % .",
    "starting from the nineteen thirties it was shown , that the virial coefficients can nowadays easily be derived from the intermolecular potential @xcite .",
    "the second virial coefficient is related to the molecular model by  @xcite    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the interaction energy between two molecules @xmath4 and @xmath5 , cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq_potential ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 denotes boltzmann s constant and the @xmath41 brackets indicate an average over the orientations @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the two molecules separated by the center of mass distance @xmath9 .",
    "the second virial coefficient was calculated here by evaluating mayer s @xmath44-function at @xmath45 radii from @xmath46 to @xmath47  , averaging over @xmath48 random orientations at each radius .",
    "the random orientations were generated using a modified monte carlo scheme @xcite .",
    "a cut - off correction was applied for distances larger than @xmath47   for the lj potential @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic interactions need no long - range correction as they vanish by angle averaging .",
    "figure  [ fig_2vk ] shows the second virial coefficient predicted by the new model is shown in comparison to the reference eos .",
    "an excellent agreement was found over the full temperature range with a maximum deviation of @xmath49  % at @xmath50  k.      due to its scientific and technical importance , experimental data on the microscopic structure of liquid ammonia are available .",
    "narten @xcite and ricci et al .",
    "@xcite applied x - ray and neutron diffraction , respectively .",
    "the results from ricci et al .",
    "show a smoother gradient and are available for all three types of atom - atom pair correlations , namely nitrogen - nitrogen ( n - n ) , nitrogen - hydrogen ( n - h ) , and hydrogen - hydrogen ( h - h ) , thus they were used for comparison here . in figure",
    "[ fig_rdf ] , these experimental radial distribution functions for liquid ammonia at 273.15  k and 0.483  mpa are compared to present predictive simulation data based on the new model .",
    "it is found that these structural properties are in very good agreement , although no adjustment was done with regard to structural properties .",
    "the atom - atom distance of the first three layers is predicted correctly , while only minor overshootings in the first peak are found .",
    "please note , that the first peak of experiment in @xmath51 and @xmath52 show intramolecular pair correlations , which are not calculated in the simulation .    in the experimental radial distribution function @xmath51 the hydrogen bonding of ammonia can be seen at 22.5  . due to the simplified approximation by off - centric partial charges ,",
    "the molecular model is not capable to describe this effect completely . but even with this simple model a small shoulder at 2.5   is obtained .",
    "a new molecular model is proposed for ammonia .",
    "this model was developed using a new modeling procedure , which speeds up the modeling process and can be applied on arbitrary molecules .",
    "the interaction sites are located according to atom positions resulting from _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "also the electrostatic interactions , here in form of partial charges , are parameterized according to high - level _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical results .",
    "the latter are obtained by calculations within a dielectric continuum to mimic the ( stronger ) interactions in the liquid phase .",
    "the partial charges for the present ammonia model are specified to yield the same dipole moment as quantum mechanics .",
    "the lennard - jones parameters were adjusted to vle data , namely vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization .",
    "a description of the vle of ammonia was reached within relative deviations of a few percents .",
    "next to this , covering a large region of states , a good prediction of both thermal and caloric properties apart from the vle was found compared to a reference eos @xcite .    predicted structural quantities , i.e. radial distribution functions in the liquid state , are in very good agreement to experimental neutron diffraction data .",
    "this shows , that molecular models adjusted to macroscopic thermodynamic properties also give reasonable results on microscopic properties .",
    "note that this is not true vice versa in most cases . with the present model a similar quality in describing the atomic radial distribution functions as impey and klein @xcite",
    "is gained , while the macroscopic properties like vapor pressure differ considerably .",
    "so the latter can be seen as the more demanding criteria .",
