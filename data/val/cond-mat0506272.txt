    "a strongly interacting ultracold atom gas displays interesting features of a correlated quantum many - body system when its dynamics is confined to one dimension @xcite . the presence of a transverse confining potential has been shown to induce characteristic resonances in the coupling constant of the two - particle s - wave scattering process @xcite , which have become known as confinement - induced resonances ( cir ) .",
    "the existence of the cir has been revealed under the simplifying assumption of a transverse parabolic confinement potential with length scale @xmath0 and for the case that the two scattering atoms belong to the same species @xcite . in this case , the center - of - mass ( com ) and relative coordinates of the two particles can be separated , allowing to factorize the problem into single - particle problems . at low temperatures ,",
    "only the com ground state is occupied , the decoupled com motion can be disregarded , and the two - body problem can be solved exactly within the pseudopotential approximation .",
    "the result is that there is exactly one bound state for any 3d scattering length @xmath1 . in the limit of small binding energy , the particles",
    "are tightly bound in the lowest - energy transverse state and form a very elongated dimer .",
    "the appearance of such a bound state is purely due to the confinement , since for @xmath2 no dimer is formed in free space . in the opposite limit of large binding energies",
    ", the dimer becomes spherically symmetric . in this regime ,",
    "the confinement is not effective , and the free - space result is recovered .",
    "moreover , a unitary equivalence exists between the hamiltonian and its projection onto those channels which are perpendicular to the one with lowest energy . as a consequence , to each bound state corresponds a bound state of the closed channels , which then causes the cir @xcite .",
    "it occurs at a universal value of the ratio @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the hurvitz zeta function .",
    "the influence of the cir has also been studied for the three - body  @xcite and the four - body problem  @xcite in the presence of confinement . in particular , the solution of the four - body problem completely determines the corresponding quasi-1d many - body bcs - bec crossover phenomenon @xcite .",
    "recently , the existence of the confinement - induced molecular bound state in a quasi-1d fermionic @xmath5k atom gas confined in an optical trap has been reported  @xcite . by using rf spectroscopy ,",
    "the binding energy of the dimer has been measured as a function of the scattering length , with quantitative agreement to the results of ref .",
    "however , the existence of the cir in the scattering states remains to be observed .",
    "although the analytical results for the parabolic confinement are instructive , realistic traps for matter waves frequently have non - linear potential forms , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for a particular example of a trap on the nanometer scale . to give another example , for the problem of tunneling of a macroscopic number of ultracold atoms between two stable states of a trapping potential",
    ", the nonlinearity clearly is crucial .",
    "hence generalization to the non - parabolic case is desirable and provided in this work .",
    "in addition , we consider traps with two different species of atoms .",
    "note that sympathetic cooling techniques require to study this case .",
    "different trap frequencies may arise for different atom species , e.g. , because of different atom masses or different magnetic quantum numbers . here",
    "we obtain general expressions for the bound - state energies and scattering resonances when the com and the relative degrees of freedom do not decouple anymore . in the parabolic limit and for intraspecies scattering",
    ", we recover well - known results @xcite . for the general case ,",
    "we show that more than one cir may appear , and that it depends on the symmetry properties of the confining potential how many resonances occur .",
    "we apply our formalism to two experimentally relevant cases : ( i ) interspecies scattering in a two - species mixture of quantum degenerate bose and fermi gases in an optical trap , and ( ii ) a single species cloud in a magnetic trap , taking into account non - parabolic corrections due to a longitudinal magnetic field suppressing majorana spin flips .",
    "as we will discuss below in more detail , the cir has a close similarity to the well - known feshbach resonance @xcite , which arises if the hilbert space can be divided into open and closed channels coupled together by a short - range interaction .",
    "due to this small but finite coupling , two incoming particles initially in the open channel visit the closed channels during the scattering process .",
    "if a bound state with energy close to the continuum threshold exists , such a process is highly enhanced and a resonance results .",

    "[ model ] , we present the general formalism .",

    "different atoms may experience a different transversal confinement potential @xmath11 .",
    "for ultracold atoms , only low - energy s - wave scattering is relevant , and the interaction between unlike atoms ( and similarly , also the interaction between the same atoms ) can be described by a fermi - huang pseudopotential @xmath12 .",

    "[ fig.2 ] the dimensionless binding energy @xmath271 of the corresponding bound state .",
    "as expected , the resonances occur at those values of @xmath272 for which the energy of the bound state of the closed channels coincides with the continuum threshold of the open channel .",
    "describing the potential created by an optical or a magnetic guide as parabolic is to some extent a simplification which has to be verified .",
    "in fact , even though the lower - energy transverse states can rather well be approximated by the eigenfunctions of a 2d harmonic oscillator , in every real trap the confinement is to some degree non - parabolic . for resonant scattering ,",
    "we expect to have a virtual occupation of many non - parabolic transverse states . as a consequence",

    "assuming that apart from the longitudinal bias field , the remaining magnetic fields create a parabolic and isotropic confinement in the transverse direction , the total confinement is given by @xmath279 where we have scaled energy in units of the parabolic trapping frequency @xmath185 and length in units of @xmath280 .",
    "the parameter @xmath281 is related to the majorana spin flip rate @xmath282 @xcite .",

    "[ fig.3 ] for @xmath283 , which corresponds to @xmath284 .",
    "we find two resonances reflecting the cylindrical symmetry of the potential ( [ poten ] ) and the weakness of non - parabolic corrections .",
    "the degeneracy of the parabolic case ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ) is lifted and the original cir is split into two nearby resonances . as expected , the effect of the non - parabolic transverse states shows up only in the deep resonant region , making the parabolic solution a very good approximation away from the resonant region . in turn , this requires a good experimental resolution in order to observe the two cir .",
    "to conclude , we have presented the general solution for two - body s - wave scattering in a two - component ultracold atom gas longitudinally confined to one dimension by an arbitrary trapping potential .",
    "the underlying key property is that the center - of - mass and the relative degrees of freedom of the two - particle problem do not decouple , as it is the case for a one - component gas and a pure parabolic confinement .",
    "thus , no reduction to an effective single - particle problem is possible and the full coupled system has to be solved . in the framework of the pseudopotential approach ,",
    "we derive the energy of the bound state when all transverse channels are closed .",
    "simple analytical results were obtained in the limiting cases of the dimer as well as the bcs limit . moreover ,",
    "scattering solutions have been obtained when just one transverse channel is open .",
    "the effective 1d interaction constant @xmath232 can be calculated after diagonalizing a reduced green s function .",
    "this can be achieved analytically for the special case of parabolic confinement , where the well - known confinement - induced resonance is recovered .",
    "for a two - component gas , as well as for a non - parabolic confinement , more than one cir occur , which reflect the symmetry properties of the confining potential .",
