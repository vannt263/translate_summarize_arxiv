    "n this paper , we consider the problem of detecting , localizing and tracking people not wearing/ carrying an electronic device , thus not actively participating in the localization effort , in large and heavily obstructed outdoor environments . to this purpose , we use an rf sensor network , _",
    "i.e. _ , a wireless system composed of low - power , inexpensive commercial of - the - shelf radio transceivers operating in the @xmath0 ghz ism band @xcite .",
    "these devices form a wireless mesh network by continuously broadcasting packets and measuring the received signal strength ( rss ) of the links of the network .",
    "radio tomographic imaging ( rti ) @xcite is applied to process the rss measurements collected by the rf sensors on multiple frequency channels @xcite and estimate 2d images of the change in the electromagnetic field of the deployment area due to the presence and movements of animates ( _ e.g. _ , people , large animals ) or metallic objects ( _ e.g. _ , cars @xcite ) . by further processing these images",
    ", the targets can be accurately detected and tracked @xcite .",
    "our work introduces an accurate and energy - efficient rti method that successfully deals with the nonstationary noise introduced in the rss measurements by environmental factors , such as rainfalls or wind - driven foliage , tipically encountered in real - world outdoor environments .",
    "rf sensor networks represent an appealing technology for detecting and tracking people outdoors : due to the small size and low cost of the rf units , they are less invasive and better conceivable than video camera networks , and considerably less expensive than ultra - wideband ( uwb ) transceivers",
    ". they also work in the dark and through smoke and non - metallic walls .",
    "however , an rf sensor network deployed outdoors faces challenging conditions , different from the more static ones typically found in real - world indoor environments @xcite .",
    "the main challenges encountered in outdoor environments are :    * the presence of what we refer to as _ environmental noise _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the significant variation in rss observed when no person is located in the monitored area due to the time - varying multipath introduced by _",
    "e.g. _ wind - driven foliage , rainfalls or snow . in homes and buildings , on the contrary ,",
    "the rss measured in quasi stationary conditions does not vary significantly with time : the spurious variation observed in stationary conditions can be introduced by overlapping wi - fi networks increasing the floor noise level of the radio channel @xcite . * the lack of an initial calibration of the system performed in stationary conditions . due to the intrinsic nonstationarity of the monitored environment , rti methods to be applied for",
    "outdoor localization can not rely on an initial calibration to estimate the average rss of the links of the network , which is then used as a reference to calculate the change in the electromagnetic field introduced by the presence of people in the monitored area . *",
    "the need to address the energy efficiency of the system .",
    "the remote locations and harsh weather conditions drive the need for a battery powered capability of the rf sensors , which , in turn , requires the adoption of an adaptive radio duty cycling mechanism to extend the lifetime of the system or , when energy harvesting systems are enforced @xcite , reduce their cost and size .",
    "several application scenarios could take advantage of an rf sensor network for outdoor people detection and localization .",
    "for example , in natural parks populated by protected animal species , a system composed of small and covert devices could be used to detect and locate poachers even in areas characterized by a dense canopy , which can not be monitored _ e.g. _ with air surveillance @xcite .",
    "an outdoor rti system could be used to monitor long international borders running across heavily forested areas from people trying to _ e.g. _ smuggle drugs or weapons , to protect large vineyards from vandalism or theft , or to create a virtual fence at a pasture site @xcite that would not require the cattle to wear gps collars .",
    "besides security and perimeter surveillance applications , an rti system would greatly extend the capabilities of _ smart spaces _ such as university campuses , malls and hospitals . in this work",
    ", we introduce a novel rti method for outdoor environments achieving high detection and localization accuracy and improving the overall system s energy efficiency .",
    "the main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows :    * we characterize the relationship existing in nonstationary outdoor environments between the variation in rss due to environmental noise and the link s _ fade level _",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ , the difference between the measured and theoretical rss of a link .",
    "* we propose a method for selecting those link - frequency channel combinations ( which we refer to as _ link - channel pairs _ ) that , even in nonstationary environmental conditions , appear to be the most reliable for detecting the presence of a person on the link line , _ i.e. _ , the imaginary straight line connecting transmitter and receiver .",
    "we verify that this selection method allows enhancing both the detection and localization accuracy while simultaneously reducing the system s energy consumption .",
    "* we introduce an adaptive method to recalibrate on - line the reference rss of the selected link - channel pairs , even in presence of environmental noise and people in the monitored area , and apply background subtraction on the estimated radio tomographic images to further increase the robustness of the system to the time - varying environmental noise .",
    "the performance of the outdoor rti method was evaluated in a set of experiments carried out in a challenging outdoor environment , _",
    "i.e _ , a @xmath1 heavily forested area with trees and bushes of various height , shape and size .",
    "tests were performed in different environmental conditions ( _ e.g. _ , with no wind , light breeze , or gusts of wind ) .",
    "false alarm rate , localization accuracy and energy efficiency associated with the novel method are compared to those of the rti methods originally introduced in @xcite , to date the most accurate rti methods used in indoor environments , which we suitably adapt to the considered outdoor scenario in order to make a fair comparison .",
    "experimental results demonstrate that the novel outdoor rti method keeps under control the false positive and negative rates ( @xmath2% and @xmath3% , respectively ) , and reduces both the localization error ( from @xmath4% to @xmath5% ) and the energy consumption of the whole system ( from @xmath6% to @xmath7% ) compared to state - of - the - art methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : related_literature ] , we survey the related literature on people detection and localization in outdoor environments and on state - of - the - art rti methods . the novel outdoor rti method is presented in section [ sec : multichannel_rti ] , while the experimental setup is described in section [ sec : setup ] .",
    "section [ sec : eval_metrics ] lists the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the system .",
    "the results of the tests are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the problem of localizing and tracking people in large outdoor areas has been addressed by several works .",
    "the system in @xcite was composed of spatially distributed rfid readers measuring the rss of rfid tags carried by people moving in the monitored area .",
    "the position of the targets was estimated by using a rss - distance model whose parameters were calibrated on - line to make the system more robust to environmental changes .",
    "the work in @xcite presented a heterogeneous system composed of low - quality wireless camera nodes devoted to people localization and rfid readers devoted to identification .",
    "both the systems in @xcite and @xcite assumed that the targets to be located were carrying an rfid tag .",
    "device - free localization and tracking of people has often been carried out by using visual sensor networks @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , wireless systems composed of a large number of low - power camera nodes .",
    "however , cameras produce a large amount of image data for the limited network s resources . in addition",
    ", cameras suffer from poor light conditions and occlusions in cluttered outdoor environments ( such as _ e.g. _ forested areas ) .",
    "for these reasons , other works have proposed using radars to detect personnel in heavily wooded areas . in @xcite , micro - doppler signals , _",
    "i.e. _ , doppler scattering returns not due to gross translation of the target but are instead produced by the periodic movements ( _ e.g. _ , of legs or arms ) of a walking human target , are exploited for detecting humans and distinguishing them from other animals .",
    "however , stand - alone low - frequency radars have a poor angular resolution . to overcome this limitation",
    ", the work in @xcite proposes a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) radar exploiting the angular diversity of spaced antennas to detect the changes in the rf channel due to personnel in the deployment area . in this work",
    ", we present an energy - efficient rti method that enables device - free detection , localization and tracking of people in large and cluttered outdoor areas covered by a small number of low - cost and low - power rf sensors .",
    "the impact of environmental factors on wireless sensor networks deployed outdoors has been previously investigated .",
    "the works in @xcite analyze how the density and seasonal variations of vegetation , and daily temperature / humidity fluctuations affect the rss and the links connectivity .",
    "the work in @xcite studies how wind , _",
    "i.e. _ , wind - driven vegetation movement , affects the propagation of radio signals at different frequencies ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ghz ) .",
    "experimental data demonstrate that the variation in rss increases with the wind speed ( more consistently at higher frequencies ) and that the fade distribution goes from being rician to being rayleigh with an increasing wind speed .",
    "however , these works did not consider the combined effect of environmental factors and animates on the measured rss .",
    "different rti methods were introduced in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "frequency diversity was exploited to improve the localization accuracy .",
    "the same principle was later applied in @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "the rti systems were deployed in stationary indoor environments ( _ i.e. _ , no changes in the environment nor time - varying environmental noise ) .",
    "the system described in @xcite was deployed in a real - world domestic environment over a three months period . to recalibrate in an on - line fashion the reference rss values of the links of the network ,",
    "the rss signals were low - pass filtered . by doing this , the system maintained an high localization accuracy ( @xmath12 m approximately ) despite the frequent changes in the environment . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors carried out tests in a through - wall scenario having some of the rf sensors located in the proximity of trees whose branches were swaying in the wind .",
    "they proposed a subspace decomposition method to separate the change in rss due to human motion from that introduced by environmental noise .",
    "however , the amount of variation in the rss signals due to the environment was estimated during an initial calibration performed with no person in the deployment area .",
    "thus , the method assumed that the spatial and temporal characteristics of the environmental noise were constant .",
    "such an assumption can not be made in a forested outdoor environment , where the environmental noise is highly time - varying .",
    "the rti methods described above did not consider the issue of energy efficiency : the nodes radio , _",
    "i.e. _ , the most energy - hungry component , was always on , being the nodes in receive mode at all times , except for when they were transmitting a packet .",
    "energy efficient methods were presented in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors apply compressed sensing techniques to rti , reducing the number of links that have to be sampled in order to reconstruct the whole image . in @xcite ,",
    "an accurate time synchronization protocol is used to enable radio duty cycling . in @xcite ,",
    "only the links near the current location of the tracked targets are measured . in our work ,",
    "we present a method to select those link - channel pairs that are robust to environmental noise ( thus , the most informative and reliable for rti ) .",
    "this approach allows increasing the energy efficiency of the system while simultaneously improving its detection and localization performance .",
    "this section describes the novel outdoor rti method . we provide the basics of rti , focusing on the solutions developed to address the challenges posed by multipath - rich and time - varying outdoor environments .",
    "the reader is invited to refer to @xcite for a detailed description of the principles of rti .",
    "algorithm [ alg : outdoor_rti_algorithm ] details the novel outdoor rti method .",
    "calculate the projection matrix @xmath13      first , we analyze the characteristics of the links in nonstationary outdoor environments .",
    "to do this , we use the concept of fade level introduced in @xcite , which defines the relationship between steady - state , narrow - band fading and the changes in rss due to a person crossing the link line . the fade level of link @xmath14 on channel @xmath15 , @xmath16 ,",
    "can be estimated as : @xmath17 where : @xmath18 in ( [ eq : fade_level ] ) , @xmath19 is the average rss of link @xmath14 on channel @xmath15 measured with no person in the proximity of the link line , and @xmath20 is the theoretical rss , predicted by using the log - distance path loss model @xcite , for two nodes at distance @xmath21 . the equation in ( [ eq : pd ] ) represents a _ node - specific _ log - distance path loss model whose parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( _ i.e. _ , the path loss exponent , reference path loss , and reference distance , respectively ) , are derived by fitting the average rss of those links having node @xmath25 as transmitter . in other works , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , a global path loss exponent was estimated by fitting the average rss of all the links of the network . in this work , by generating for each rf sensor an individual distance - rss model , hardware variability factors ( such as _ e.g. _ antenna impedance matching or relative antenna orientation between transmitter and receiver @xcite ) and local environmental differences ( such as _ e.g. _ the proximity to the node of dense foliage ) are taken into consideration @xcite . in section [ sec : results ] , we show that , by deriving an individual model for each node instead of a global one , the system achieves better detection and localization performance .    the fade level can be interpreted as a measure of whether a link - channel pair is experiencing destructive or constructive multipath interference ( or not ) : in the first case , the fade level is negative and the link - channel pair is said to be in _ deep fade _ ; in the latter case , the fade level is positive and the link - channel pair is said to be in _ anti - fade_. however , even in multipath - rich indoor environments , the measured rss does not vary significantly unless , _",
    "e.g. _ , a human body affects the propagation of one ( or more ) of the multipath components . on the contrary , outdoor environmental factors , such as wind , rainfall or snow ,",
    "introduce a significant variation in rss even when no person is found in the deployment area .",
    "we measure the effect of the environmental noise on a link - channel pair as the variance of the rss measurements collected when no person is in the proximity of the link line .",
    "the relationship between fade level and environmental noise is depicted in figure [ fig : fl_var_stationary ] .",
    "the points in figure [ fig : fl_var_stationary](a ) are obtained by measuring the rss of all the link - channel pairs of the system described in section [ sec : setup ] during four different intervals of @xmath26 minutes with wind of varying intensity blowing in the deployment area .",
    "figure [ fig : fl_var_stationary](b ) shows the boxplot of the rss variance of all the link - channel pairs , divided in six sub - groups ( a - f ) based on their fade level .",
    "the data show that link - channel pairs in deep fade , _",
    "i.e. _ , those having negative fade level , have a higher rss variance when the wind becomes stronger .",
    "thus , those links hardly contribute to the detection and localization problems .",
    "data in figure [ fig : fl_var_stationary ] show that link - channel pairs with a positive fade level ( _ i.e. _ , in anti - fade ) are more robust to environmental noise .",
    "moreover , link - channel pairs in anti - fade are characterized by a smaller sensitivity area @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the area where a person affects the rss .",
    "this area is modeled as an ellipse having transmitter and receiver at the foci @xcite : for link - channel pairs in anti - fade , it can be modeled as a _",
    "narrow _ ellipse around the link line .",
    "thus , link - channel pairs with a positive fade level are not only more robust to environmental noise but can also be considered more reliable indicators of the presence of a person in the proximity of the link line .",
    "we provide an example of this in figure [ fig : link_example ] , which shows the rss , measured on different frequency channels , of a @xmath27 m link cutting through several branches of the trees found in the area . during the test , carried out in a day with wind of moderate intensity",
    ", a person crossed the link line at @xmath28 s. the only channel in anti - fade , _",
    "i.e. _ , channel @xmath29 having @xmath30 dbm , measured a consistent attenuation ( @xmath10 dbm ) in rss at the crossing event , while exhibiting small variation in rss due to the movements of the wind - driven foliage . on the contrary ,",
    "the other two channels in deep fade show a continuous , significant variation in rss due to the action of the wind , and this does not allow to unequivocally detect the crossing event .",
    "we now present a method to select a subset of link - channel pairs to be used for rti .",
    "the reason for doing this is twofold : on one hand , we want to select link - channel pairs that are more robust to environmental noise and , at the same time , more informative about the position of the targets in order to enhance the detection and localization performance of the system . on the other ,",
    "we want to increase the energy efficiency of the system , since the radio of the rf sensors can be turned off during the tdma slots originally allocated to the discarded link - channel pairs .",
    "define @xmath31 to be the set of link - channel pairs with positive fade level @xmath32 where @xmath14 is the link and @xmath15 the frequency channel .",
    "due to the low nodes density typical of outdoor deployments and the presence of several obstructions , some link - channel pairs may measure a rss close to the sensitivity threshold of the radio modules ( @xmath33 dbm at typical ambient temperatures for the radios described in section [ hardware_protocol ] ) .",
    "links with an average rss close to the sensitivity threshold belong to a _ grey region _",
    "@xcite in which their connectivity performance becomes highly unpredictable and their rss measurements include noise and interference due to very weak signals .",
    "moreover , the connectivity of these links is highly affected by changes in the environment @xcite .",
    "thus , we discard all link - channel pairs with an average rss lower than a pre - defined threshold @xmath34 ( we set @xmath35 dbm ) .",
    "define @xmath36 to be the set of link - channel pairs with average rss higher than @xmath34 @xmath37 now define @xmath38 to be the set of link - channel pairs to be considered . both the fade level and the average rss of the link - channel pairs are estimated when no person is found in the deployment area .    for each link - channel pair ,",
    "we calculate a weight @xmath39 as follows @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the rss variance measured when no person is found in the deployment area .",
    "consequently , link - channel pairs having low rss variance are assigned a higher weight , since the variations in rss measured on such links have a higher probability of being human - induced .",
    "finally , define the set @xmath42 as @xmath43 _",
    "i.e. _ , as the set in which , for each link in @xmath44 , only the frequency channel in @xmath45 ( where @xmath45 represents the set of measured frequency channels ) characterized by the largest weight is included .",
    "the change in rss at time @xmath46 for each link - channel pair in @xmath42 is estimated as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the _ measured _ and _ reference _ rss of the link - channel pair @xmath50 , both considered at time @xmath46 , respectively . in",
    "most of the previous works ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the reference rss was calculated as the average rss measured during an initial calibration of the system carried out in absence of people in the monitored area .",
    "this approach showed to be effective in time invariant indoor environments . in @xcite ,",
    "the reference rss was estimated in real - time by low - pass filtering the measured rss .",
    "this approach was effective in a dynamic domestic environment characterized by frequent , bursty events modifying the attenuation field of the deployment area .",
    "however , this approach was not effective when the person to be localized was not moving for an extended period of time ( _ e.g. _ , sleeping ) : in that case , the reference rss quickly converged to the measured rss , bringing the corresponding change in rss to zero despite the presence of the person in the deployment area . due to the presence of a time - varying environmental noise affecting the rss measurements , an outdoor rti system must continuously update the reference rss of the selected link - channel pairs , even when people are not moving inside the deployment area .    to estimate the reference rss in real - time without losing people who stop moving , we use the following procedure .",
    "we first create , for each selected link - channel pair , a fifo buffer of @xmath51 elements .",
    "@xmath52 is the length of the considered time window ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath53 s ) and @xmath54 is the sampling interval of the rti system , _",
    "i.e. _ , the interval of time required by the system to complete all the tdma rounds of communication on the frequency channels in @xmath45 ( see section [ hardware_protocol ] ) . define @xmath55 to be the set of estimated positions at time @xmath46 of the people located in the deployment area ( @xmath56 if no person is in the deployment area ) .",
    "since the change in rss of a link is assumed to be a spatial integral of the attenuation field of the monitored area , only the attenuation in the elliptical sensitivity area of the link will affect its rss .",
    "thus , at time @xmath46 , only the fifo buffers of link - channel pairs whose sensitivity areas do not include one of the positions in @xmath55 are updated .",
    "for each link - channel pair in @xmath42 , the reference rss @xmath49 is calculated as the average of the rss measurements contained in its fifo buffer . in this way",
    ", the system does not require an initial calibration to calculate the reference rss .",
    "moreover , the reference rss does not converge to the measured rss even when the person stops moving for an extended period of time .",
    "when we consider all the @xmath57 links of the network , the change in the electromagnetic field of the deployment area @xmath58 is estimated as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are vector of size @xmath57 of the rss change and noise of the links of the network , respectively .",
    "for the links belonging to @xmath42 , the rss change is calculated as in ( [ eq : rss_change ] ) .",
    "for all the others , the rss change is zero .",
    "vector @xmath58 represents the change in the _ discretized _ electromagnetic field of the monitored area , _",
    "i.e. _ , the intensity of each pixel of the radio tomographic image to be estimated .",
    "thus , @xmath58 is a vector of size @xmath62 , where @xmath62 is the total number of pixels of the radio tomographic image .",
    "element @xmath63 of the weight matrix @xmath64 indicates how pixel @xmath65 affects the change in rss of link @xmath14 . since the sensitivity area of a link",
    "is modeled as an ellipse @xcite , @xmath63 is computed as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the area of the ellipse , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sensitivity area , of link @xmath14 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the distances of pixel @xmath65 from the transmitter and receiver , respectively , and @xmath70 is the parameter defining the width of the sensitivity area . the linear model in ( [ eq : matrix_rti ] ) is based on the correlated shadowing models in @xcite .",
    "regularization @xcite is required to solve the ill - posed problem of estimating the intensity of the _ many _ pixels in @xmath58 from the _ few _ links measurements in @xmath60 .",
    "we apply the regularized least square approach used also in @xcite : @xmath71 where : @xmath72 @xmath73 is the regularization parameter ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath74 ) .",
    "the a priori covariance matrix @xmath75 is calculated using an exponential spatial decay model @xcite : @xmath76=\\sigma_{x}^{2}e^{-d_{i , j } /\\delta_{c}},\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the variance at each pixel , @xmath78 is the euclidean distance between pixels @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is a pixels correlation distance parameter .",
    "the inversion matrix @xmath13 , of size @xmath82 , has to be calculated only once after the deployment of the rf sensors , so that @xmath83 in ( [ eq : linear_transformation ] ) can be estimated in real - time .",
    "background subtraction is often used in machine vision in order to detect moving objects in videos recorded by static cameras . by iterating the process described in section [ image_estimation ] and exploiting the temporal continuity of the estimated images ,",
    "these can be considered as the _ frames _ of a video in which the targets to be detected and tracked are the blobs corresponding to people entering and moving in the monitored area .",
    "over the years , several background subtraction methods have been proposed @xcite .",
    "motion detection is performed by calculating the pixel - wise difference between the current frame and a reference ( or background ) image , which in our case is the estimated electromagnetic field of the monitored area when no person is found in it .",
    "only the pixels whose intensity is significantly different from that of the background image are labeled as _ foreground _ pixels , thus considered as potential moving objects , _",
    "i.e. _ , people . in a rti system deployed outdoor , the background image can change , gradually or suddenly , due to the environmental noise in the rss signals . thus , it must be continuously updated to increase the robustness of the motion detection process .",
    "we model each pixel of the background image as a realization of a gaussian distribution @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the expectation and standard deviation of the intensity of pixel @xmath87 at time @xmath46 .",
    "these parameters are computed using the corresponding fifo buffers containing @xmath88 elements for each pixel .",
    "the set of background pixels @xmath89 is defined as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a threshold defining the confidence interval of the intensity of the pixels ( we set @xmath92 ) and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the mean and standard deviation of the gaussian distribution of pixel @xmath65 estimated at time @xmath95 , respectively . at time @xmath46 ,",
    "only the fifo buffers of the pixels in the background are updated with the current intensity value .    at time @xmath46 , the background image @xmath96 is calculated as a @xmath97 vector whose elements are the mean of the pixels fifo buffers : @xmath98.\\ ] ] finally , the background subtracted radio tomographic image , @xmath99 , is calculated as : @xmath100 the background subtraction allows increasing the difference in intensity between the pixels of the blobs corresponding to real people and those of the blobs introduced by the environmental noise , making the blobs tracking more accurate .      to detect and track the blobs corresponding to real people , we apply on @xmath99 the method in @xcite , providing high accuracy ( @xmath101 m tracking error approximately ) and real - time performance with multiple people even when these have intersecting trajectories .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description of the applied multiple target tracking method . by applying the same detection and tracking methods , we can fairly evaluate the performance of the novel outdoor rti method presented in this work and compare it to previous works .",

    "the rss variance of the link - channel pairs estimated in stationary conditions is not taken into consideration .",
    "we refer to the rti method in @xcite as _ relative fade level _ , or _ rfl _ , and consider three different versions :    * the link - channel pairs with @xmath106 are selected .",

    "the results in figure [ fig : sens_analysis ] indicate that the proposed outdoor rti method is robust to variations of the three considered parameters , as both @xmath118 and @xmath117 have a @xmath10% maximum variation from the values reported in table [ t : rti_methods_table ] .",
    "in this paper , we present and evaluate a novel rti method for accurately detecting and tracking people in nonstationary outdoor environments .",
    "an rti system is composed of static rf sensors , communicating on multiple frequency channels in the @xmath0 ghz ism band , which continuously measure the rss of the links of the mesh network to estimate the change in the electromagnetic field of the monitored area introduced by the presence and movements of people .",

    "i.e. _ , the variation in rss introduced by environmental factors such as wind - driven foliage , rainfalls , or snow .",
    "in addition , the proposed method improves the energy efficiency of the system by selecting only link - channel pairs which are reliable indicators of the presence of a person on the link line . to experimentally verify the performance of the outdoor rti method , we deploy a rti system in a large forested area .",
    "the results demonstrate that the novel outdoor rti method minimizes the false alarm rate and reduces significantly the localization error ( from @xmath4% to @xmath5% ) and energy consumption ( from @xmath6% to @xmath7% ) compared to already existing indoor rti methods , which we suitably adapted to the considered outdoor scenario to grant a fair comparison .    in future works",
    ", we will focus on improving the energy efficiency of the rti system by applying area coverage criteria to further reduce the set of selected link - channel pairs and by adaptively tuning the sampling frequency of the system based on the observed environmental conditions .",
