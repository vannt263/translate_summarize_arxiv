    "based on the equivalence principle , it is expected that some physical features of gravity can be mimicked by accelerated frames in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the rindler frame , which is adapted to a family of uniformly accelerated observers , is a famous example of a non - inertial system that simulates some characteristics of a black hole s geometry@xcite .",
    "this frame has been widely investigated in the literature and here we are going to start our discussion pointing out a peculiar aspect of the rindler frame .",
    "it is related to the remarkable characteristic that the proper acceleration @xmath0 of rindler observers , which is constant along their worldlines , varies according to the law @xmath1 in relation to the observers , where @xmath2 corresponds to the initial distance of the observer with respect to the origin of an inertial frame . as it is well known , the reason of this behavior is related to the geometric properties of the timelike killing field which generates the congruence .",
    "on the other hand , from the physical point of view , it is very suggestive that this particular dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath2 is connected to the behavior of static observers in schwarzschild geometry in the vicinity of the horizon . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath2 denotes the radial distance of an observer to the horizon , then , the proper acceleration the observers need in order to stay at rest in their position close to the horizon is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the rindler congruence and the static schwarzschild observers have the same acceleration field @xmath4 .",
    "this equivalence reinforce the linkage between rindler frame and the exterior of a black hole .",
    "however , it happens that the inverse law holds only in the region where @xmath2 is small in comparison to the schwarzschild radius of the black hole .",
    "indeed , static observers at long distances are submitted to an acceleration field proportional to @xmath5 , ( i.e , they obey the inverse square law of newtonian gravitation ) and , in the intermediate domain , the dependence of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath2 is described by a much more complicated function .",
    "we can say , then , that static observers in the schwarzschild geometry are accelerated according to a cumbersome function @xmath4 which reduces to the power law @xmath3 only in the region near the horizon .",
    "all these considerations led us to turn our attention to the study of a congruence of timelike curves whose acceleration field @xmath6 coincides with the acceleration field of static observers in the schwarzschild spacetime . in this case , only in the range of small values of @xmath2 , the congruence defined in minkowski spacetime will be equivalent to the worldlines of rindler observers .",
    "of course this discussion is not limited to the schwarzschild spacetime and can be extend to encompass any static spacetime . in this paper , motivated by these ideas",
    ", we are going to investigate congruences in minkowski spacetime that obey a generic law @xmath4 , focusing on the problem of determining a coordinate system adapted to the non - inertial frame associated to these congruences .",
    "a fundamental ingredient in this formalism is the determination of the simultaneity hypersurfaces relative to the non - inertial frame .",
    "as we shall see , the embedding functions of the simultaneity hypersurfaces into minkowski spacetime are explicitly obtained for any arbitrary function @xmath7 , by using the locality principle @xcite .",
    "the formulation of this general scheme allow us to discuss the correspondence between non - inertial frames in minkowski spacetime and static observers of any static spacetimes .",
    "the particular case concerning the schwarzschild spacetime , due to its relevance , is investigated in detail .",
    "considering the importance of the acceleration of static observers in this context , it is desirable to find a field equation that regulates the behavior of @xmath0 . by using the embedding formalism",
    "we obtain , from the einstein equations , a covariant field equation for the proper acceleration that has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "indeed , from the perspective of static observers , non - interacting bodies are accelerated as if they were under the influence of a gravitational field whose intensity is precisely equal to @xmath0 but in the opposite direction .",
    "thus , the field equation for @xmath0 may be understood as that the exact relativistic version of the gravitational field equation of newtonian theory , as we shall see .    by admitting additional symmetries ,",
    "we can focus our attention in a special class of static spacetimes characterized by the fact that the level surfaces of the norm of the proper acceleration field are maximally symmetric two - dimensional spaces .",
    "this assumption simplifies greatly the einstein equations and as a consequence the field equation can be totally written in terms of the extrinsic and intrinsic curvature of the level surfaces and the acceleration field .",
    "the general form of the energy - momentum tensor of the possible sources of this special kind of static spacetimes can be deduced from the einstein equation . as we shall see",
    ", it corresponds to non - viscous fluids that may be anisotropic .",
    "indeed , the pressure in the parallel direction @xmath8 to the acceleration field may be different from the pressure the fluid exerts in the orthogonal direction @xmath9 . in the particular case",
    "in which @xmath10 and the parallel pressure satisfies the state equation characteristic of a false vacuum state , the produced spacetime possesses an intriguing property : the static observers are accelerated precisely according to the rindler law , although they are in a curved spacetime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the first section we review the rindler frame in order to establish the notation and the techniques necessary for the construction of a coordinate system adapted to a non - inertial frame . in the second section",
    ", we study the induced geometry in the simultaneity hypersurfaces relative to the accelerated congruence .",
    "next , in the third section , the idea of establishing a mapping between non - inertial frame and static observers is elaborated and the particular case related to the schwarzschild spacetime is discussed in detail .",
    "the fourth section is dedicated to determine the field equation that regulates the acceleration field of static observers in curved spacetimes and to study the energy - momentum tensor of the sources that generate a special class of static spacetimes .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us initially consider a two - dimensional minkowski spacetime mapped by coordinates @xmath11 of an inertial system @xmath12 consider now an observer submitted to a constant proper acceleration @xmath13 , where @xmath2 corresponds to the initial distance of the observer with respect to the origin of @xmath12 the worldline of this observer , that we will denote by @xmath14 henceforth , is described by the following parametric curve:@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the proper time of @xmath14 .",
    "it can be directly checked that the proper acceleration of the observer is indeed @xmath7 and that in the initial position , @xmath17 , the observer is instantaneously at rest .    in the spacetime diagram of @xmath18",
    "this worldline is a hyperbola given by the equation@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance from the vertex of the hyperbola to its center @xmath21 , located at the @xmath22-axis .",
    "the motion equations ( [ eqt ] ) and ( [ eqx ] ) may also be understood according to a different perspective that is more appropriate to our discussion .",
    "they can be considered as a set of equations which describe a family of accelerated observers , where for each value of @xmath2 corresponds a different observer .",
    "thus , with respect to the congruence , the coordinate @xmath2 can be viewed as a parameter that identify each member of the family .",
    "it is important to emphasize that each observer suffers an uniform acceleration along its worldline .",
    "however , distinct observers are submitted to different accelerations according to a generic law @xmath6 .",
    "we want now to construct a coordinate system adapted to this non - inertial frame .",
    "a crucial element in this discussion is the notion of simultaneity associated to the frame .",
    "there is no privileged or natural way to establish it and as a consequence there are a multitude of options that can be found in the literature .",
    "every possible way leads to a different kind of coordinate system@xcite .    here",
    "we will follow a very reasonable idea known as the locality principle .",
    "according to this principle the accelerated observer is instantaneously equivalent to the co - moving inertial observer .",
    "the reason is that they share the same position and velocity instantaneously and therefore , as both observers have the same physical state according to non - quantum mechanics , they should be considered physically equivalent at that moment .",
    "if we admit this hypothesis as being valid then it is natural to assume that the set of simultaneous events for the accelerated observer coincides locally with the set of simultaneous events relative to the co - moving inertial observer .    in minkowski spacetime",
    "this set could be identified as follows .",
    "consider @xmath23 the co - moving inertial frame relative to the observer @xmath14 at a certain instant of time @xmath24 .",
    "obviously ( by definition ) , the accelerated observer will be find in @xmath25 , the origin of @xmath23 , with null velocity instantaneously . now , with respect to the inertial frame @xmath26 , let @xmath27 be the components of the position vector of a generic event @xmath28 and @xmath29 the vector that localize the origin of @xmath23 - which corresponds also to the spacetime position of @xmath14 at instant @xmath24 .",
    "the event @xmath28 will be considered simultaneous to @xmath25 , in the inertial frame @xmath23 , if the relative position of @xmath28 ( which is given by @xmath30 ) has no timelike component when decomposed in the coordinate basis associated to @xmath31 , since , in this case , there will be no timelike separation between the events @xmath28 and @xmath25 as viewed from @xmath32 frame .    considering that the direction of the timelike axis of the frame @xmath33 coincides with the direction of the vector @xmath34 ( the proper velocity of @xmath14 ) , then",
    ", it follows that the condition of simultaneity is equivalent to the orthogonality condition between the relative position and @xmath34 in the minkowski metric : @xmath35 in the two - dimensional case , the solution of the above equation , obviously , corresponds exactly to the @xmath36axis of @xmath37    when we are dealing with an observer @xmath14 of the accelerated congruence , then , based on the principle of locality , we should be aware that the validity of equation ( [ simeq ] ) is local , since @xmath34 changes in time ( the observer is accelerated ) and with respect to the space ( different observers are submitted to different accelerations ) .",
    "so the equation that defines simultaneous events relative to accelerated frame is an infinitesimal version of the above equation , i.e.,@xmath38 this means that the proper velocity of each observer must be orthogonal to any infinitesimal displacement in the simultaneity section , @xmath39 , in every point of the hypersurface . in other words ,",
    "proper velocity is the normal vector of the simultaneity sections .",
    "let us assume that the simultaneity sections can be described by a function @xmath40 defined in minkowski spacetime .",
    "more precisely , let us admit that each equation @xmath41__constant _ _ determines a hypersurface in spacetime which corresponds to a simultaneity section adapted to the accelerated observers .",
    "we know that the normal vector of the hypersurface is proportional to the gradient of the function @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , in order to satisfy equation ( [ simdif ] ) , we must have:@xmath42 where @xmath43 is the modulus of the norm of the gradient in minkowski metric .    for the sake of simplicity let us use",
    "coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath24 to localize events in the place of @xmath16 in order to make the notation simpler . ] .",
    "of course , whenever it is necessary , we can , from equations ( [ eqt ] ) and ( [ eqx ] ) , obtain the corresponding @xmath11-coordinates in the frame @xmath26 .",
    "thus , assuming we have the function @xmath44 , equation ( [ grad ] ) can be written , by using a well - known relation involving partial derivatives , in the following way@xmath45 on the other hand , by using equations ( [ eqt ] ) and ( [ eqx ] ) as transformation equations , @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be determined from the components of the proper velocity @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we find @xmath50 therefore , the equation for simultaneity hypersurface takes the form:@xmath51    in order to solve this equation it is convenient to introduce a new coordinate @xmath52 in terms of which the above equation reduces to@xmath53    this equation can be directly integrated and the solution is @xmath54   \\label{sim section}%\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is some arbitrary function .",
    "for each specified value @xmath56 , equation ( [ sim section ] ) gives us the coordinates @xmath57 of the simultaneous events relative to the non - inertial frame .",
    "the simultaneity hypersurfaces can also be described by parametric equations in the coordinate system of the inertial frame @xmath26 . indeed , by using equations ( [ eqt ] ) , ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ sim section ] )",
    ", we find : @xmath58 \\label{tsim}\\\\ x   &   = g_{\\varphi}\\left (   \\rho\\right )   \\equiv\\frac{2}{a}\\left [   \\frac{\\left ( f\\left (   \\varphi\\right )   a\\exp\\left (   \\int ad\\rho\\right )   \\right )   ^{2}% } { 1-\\left (   f\\left (   \\varphi\\right )   a\\exp\\left (   \\int ad\\rho\\right )   \\right ) ^{2}}\\right ]   + \\rho\\label{xsim}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as we have mentioned , the coordinate @xmath40 can be used to label the simultaneity hypersurfaces . for each value",
    "@xmath56 corresponds a simultaneity hypersurface and the equations above give the embedding functions of the hypersurface in the minkowski spacetime . by varying the coordinate @xmath2 , we can find the image of the hypersurfaces embedded in the spacetime diagram of @xmath26 frame .",
    "it is also possible to connect @xmath40 with the proper time that is measured by observers . choosing a certain particular observer to serve as a reference ,",
    "let us say @xmath59 then , from equation ( [ sim section ] ) , we find the following relation@xmath60 thus , the simultaneity section may be labelled , in an equivalent way , by the proper time @xmath61 of the observer @xmath62 .",
    "the equations ( [ tsim ] ) and ( [ xsim ] ) are very general in the sense that they are applicable to any function @xmath6 . in the appendix",
    ", we analyze several simple cases of physical interest .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows that the general formulas ( [ tsim ] ) and ( [ xsim ] ) reproduce the rindler congruence when we take @xmath1 . in the second figure ,",
    "we have considered a congruence that follows the inverse square law . and at last , the uniform acceleration field @xmath63 , which was also considered with a different notion of simultaneity in the literature @xcite , is examined in figure ( 3 ) .      a generalization to",
    "( 3 + 1)-dimensions can be immediately obtained as soon as we have established the symmetry of the spatial distribution of the observers .",
    "this is directly connected with the interpretation of @xmath2 as a spatial coordinate .",
    "for instance , if the spherical symmetry is admitted , then , it is implicitly assumed that the observers are performing a radial motion and consequently @xmath2 plays the role of a radial coordinate .",
    "it follows then that the simultaneity hypersurfaces are described by the equations : @xmath64 however , in the case of cylindrical symmetry , the embedding functions are@xmath65 while the plane symmetry leads to the following embedding map@xmath66    at this point , once we have already described the hypersurface by the embedding functions , we are able now to study the induced geometry in this hypersurface . with this purpose , let us first recall some elements of the embedding formalism .",
    "let @xmath67 be an embedding map of a hypersurface @xmath68 in a manifold @xmath69 . given a coordinate system @xmath70 on @xmath68 and @xmath71 on @xmath69",
    ", the embedding functions can be explicitly written as@xmath72    the differential @xmath73 , which is injective by definition , maps vectors of the tangent space of @xmath68 into vectors of the tangent space of @xmath74 in particular , the basis vectors can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76    if the manifold @xmath69 is equipped with a metric , @xmath77 , then , the embedding induces a metric @xmath78 in the hypersurface , which , in terms of the coordinate basis , is given by@xmath79    the normal vector of the hypersurface @xmath68 relative to @xmath69 is , in the case of our congruence , the timelike vector @xmath80 the orthogonality condition with respect to the tangent vector @xmath81 can be expressed as @xmath82 .    in the present formalism",
    "an important concept is that of a projection tensor @xmath83 , which maps vectors of the tangent space of @xmath69 onto the tangent space of the hypersurface @xmath84 its components are defined as@xmath85    it is clear that , for any vector @xmath86 , the projection @xmath87 can be considered as a vector of the tangent space of @xmath68 .",
    "therefore it can be written in terms of the basis @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , the projection of @xmath89 can be written as @xmath90 , for some vielbein @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we have@xmath92    considering this relation and taking the inner product with vectors of the basis @xmath93 , it is possible to show that @xmath91 is related to @xmath94 according to the following formula : @xmath95    the embedding also induces a covariant derivative in @xmath84 if @xmath96 is the covariant derivative defined in @xmath69 , compatible with @xmath97 then , by using the projection tensor , we can define a covariant derivative in @xmath68 in the following way @xmath98 where @xmath99 is some vector which belongs to the tangent space of @xmath68 ( more precisely , an extension of the vector ) .",
    "it can be checked that the induced covariant derivative is also compatible with the induced metric @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "another important concept in the context of the embedding formalism is that of extrinsic curvature @xmath100 . roughly speaking",
    ", we can say that it measures the variation of the normal vector along tangent directions of the hypersurface @xmath68 . in terms of its components , we have the following definition:@xmath101    from the induced covariant derivative , the intrinsic riemann tensor @xmath102 of the hypersurface @xmath68 can be naturally constructed . as it is well known , from relation ( [ covd ] ) , the tensor @xmath103 can be put in connection with the components of the riemnan tensor @xmath104 defined in @xmath69 , according to the gauss equation @xcite:@xmath105 there is also the codazzi equation that gives the variation of extrinsic curvature on the hypersurface @xmath68 @xcite:@xmath106    in our case the ambient space @xmath69 is the minkowski space , so these equations reduce to:@xmath107    after we have briefly reviewed these general concepts regarding the embedding formalism , let us now turn our attention to our particular embedding maps in order to study the induced geometry in @xmath68 . by using the embedding functions , given by the sets of equations ( [ st])-([sz ] ) , ( [ ct])-([cz ] ) and ( [ pt])-([pz ] ) , and identifying explicitly the intrinsic coordinates for each embedding map , we can directly calculate @xmath94 and @xmath100 .",
    "first we are going to consider the case of spherical symmetry .",
    "of course , the intrinsic coordinates of the simultaneity hypersurface are : @xmath108 . in this coordinate system the induced metric in @xmath68 , according to the equation ( [ hab ] ) , is given by@xmath109",

    ", all non - null components of @xmath103 can be determined by this following set of components:@xmath112 it is interesting to note that the component @xmath113 is non - null unless the observers are not accelerated @xmath114 .",

    "note that , besides the case of null acceleration , @xmath116 is zero for a congruence whose acceleration is @xmath117 .",
    "this means that the rindler congruence is the unique non - inertial frame in which the adapted simultaneity hypersurfaces are flat .    for the plane symmetry , we have@xmath109   ^{2}d\\rho^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}%\\ ] ] and the hypersurfaces are flat for any function @xmath6 .",
    "intuitively it is expected that , with respect to static observers , free - falling bodies seem to be accelerated . evoking a newtonian picture ,",
    "this acceleration can be interpreted as the effect of a local gravitational field@xcite .",
    "thus , motivated by the equivalence principle , we are led to conjecture that accelerated observers in minkowski spacetime with the same proper acceleration of the static observers could simulate aspects of the gravitational field in their non - inertial frame .",
    "this establishes a connection between static observes of curved spaces and accelerated observers in minkowski spacetime .",
    "here we want to examine this connection in detail considering the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "let us start our discussion recalling some important definitions .",
    "a spacetime is static if it admits a timelike killing field @xmath118 , which is also hypersurface - orthogonal @xcite . in a spacetime that possess this symmetry ,",
    "a static observer can be defined as a particle which follows a worldline whose proper velocity @xmath119 is proportional to the killing field:@xmath120 where @xmath121 is the normalization function which satisfies @xmath122 .",
    "the reason for this definition is very clear if we consider coordinates adapted to this killing field .",
    "it can be shown that there exist coordinates in which the metric can be put in the following form @xcite:@xmath123 where the components @xmath124 and @xmath125 do not depend on @xmath126 . in this",
    "coordinates , the killing field assumes the following simple form : @xmath127 .",
    "hence , static observers , according to ( [ statico ] ) , will be characterized by worldlines along which the spatial coordinates do not change .",
    "note also that @xmath128 , in these coordinates .    in a curved spacetime",
    "static observers do not follow geodesics .",
    "obviously they must be accelerated against the gravitational attraction in order to keep their spatial position unchanged . by using the definition ( [ statico ] ) and the killing equation",
    ", we can show that the observer s acceleration , @xmath129 , can be written as @xcite : @xmath130    usually the norm of the proper acceleration of an observer is interpreted as the acceleration that is measured by an instantaneous co - moving free - falling frame . indeed , if we denote the quantities in the free - falling frame by a hat sign and @xmath131 as the projection operator orthogonal to @xmath34 ( see equation ( [ pi ] ) ) then , the proper acceleration norm can written as @xmath132 note that we have used the orthogonality condition @xmath133 and the fact that in the free - falling frame , the projection tensor assume locally the diagonal form @xmath134    we should emphasize that this description so far developed here is valid for all static spacetimes .",
    "now let us concentrate our discussion on the special case of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "considering the schwarzschild metric@xmath135 where @xmath136 , it is easy to verify , by using ( [ a ] ) , that the proper acceleration field depends on the position of the static observers according to the formula : @xmath137    here the acceleration is explicitly written in terms of the coordinate @xmath138 in order to make a comparison with the rindler congruence , it is convenient to find @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 - the distance of the observer s position to the event horizon located at schwarzschild radius ( @xmath139 integrating the line element in the radial direction from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , we find@xmath142   \\label{rhor}%\\ ] ] it would be very convenient to write @xmath141 in terms @xmath2 , but the inverse function can not be found in an exact form . however , employing the perturbation method , approximate expressions can be obtained .",
    "for instance , in a domain close to the horizon , the following expansion is valid@xmath143 where @xmath144 is some function of @xmath2 which is small compared to @xmath140 . substituting ( [ rdelta ] ) in the equation ( [ rhor ] ) we obtain , up to order @xmath145 the result @xmath146 .",
    "now considering the expansion of the function @xmath144 in power series , this last equation gives@xmath147 which , combined with equation ( [ aschw ] ) and ( [ rdelta ] ) yields the proper acceleration of static observers that lie in the vicinity the horizon@xmath148  this result clearly shows that the dependence @xmath149 which holds for rindler observers , is valid only approximately for those observers which are very close to the horizon .    in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath150 , the expression ( [ rhor ] ) gives us , in the first order approximation , @xmath151 and , then , equation ( [ aschw ] ) now yields @xmath152 which , obviously , reproduces the inverse square law predicted by newtonian theory of gravity .",
    "the equation ( [ aschw ] ) gives us the proper acceleration that the static observers in schwarzschild spacetime are submitted to . in the context of the present of discussion ,",
    "we are now led to consider a congruence of observers in minkowski spacetime whose acceleration field @xmath6 obeys the same law ( [ aschw ] ) .",
    "the general scheme was already developed in the previous section .",
    "the analysis relative to the schwarzschild static observers can be promptly done as a particular case , just by using the appropriate acceleration law ( [ aschw ] ) .",
    "below we show explicitly the embedding functions in terms of the coordinate @xmath141:@xmath153 \\\\",

    "it is interesting to note , comparing with fig.(1 ) , that for short distances the behavior is very similar to the rindler congruence while that asymptotically the inverse square law is recovered ( see fig.(2 ) ) .    as we have already seen in the previous section ,",
    "once the embedding functions are determined , the induced geometry can be directly analyzed by the techniques presented in the section ( 2 ) .",
    "considering the spherical symmetry of schwarzschild spacetime , equations ( [ st])-([sz ] ) are the natural choice for the embedding functions .",
    "this means that the induced metric is given by ( [ dls ] ) and the curvature of the simultaneity hypersurfaces are described by the riemann tensor calculated in ( [ sriem1 ] ) , ( [ sriem2 ] ) and ( [ sriem3 ] ) , taking into account the extrinsic curvature which is evaluated in equations ( [ sk1 ] ) , ( [ sk2 ] ) and ( [ sk3 ] ) .",

    "these projections yield @xcite@xmath164 where @xmath165 is the intrinsic ricci tensor of @xmath68 and @xmath166 is a symmetric tensor defined as@xmath167 this tensor inhabits the hypersurface @xmath68 , but it is not an intrinsic geometric quantity of the hypersurface since it depends on the orthogonal components of riemann tensor defined in the ambient space @xmath69 .",
    "as we shall see , @xmath166 can be written in terms of the components of the proper acceleration . indeed , from the definition of the riemann tensor",
    ", we have@xmath168 by using ( [ du ] ) in the above equation and contracting it with @xmath169 , we find@xmath170 where , for the sake of simplicity , we are using the notation : @xmath171    the acceleration vector @xmath172 is orthogonal to the proper velocity @xmath34 , this means that it belongs to the tangent space of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , by using the definition of induced covariant derivative ( see equation ( [ covd ] ) ) , it possible to write @xmath173    thus , the equations ( [ rij ] ) and ( [ ruu ] ) assume the form@xmath174    taking into account the einstein equations , @xmath175 , we can say that the above equations represent the field equations for the proper acceleration of static observers .",
    "in particular the equation ( [ eqa ] ) has a very interesting form that resembles the newtonian gravitational field equation .",
    "however we have to highlight three important modifications due to the relativistic effects : i)the energy density @xmath176 is no longer the exclusive source of gravity , since there is now contributions that come from other components of the energy - momentum tensor ; ii)there is the non - linear term @xmath177 , whose presence in ( [ eqa ] ) demonstrates that gravity is a self - interacting field in the relativistic regime ; and iii ) there is the fact that the divergence of @xmath178 depends on the intrinsic geometry of the hypersurface @xmath68 , which can be curved .",
    "we should also point out that equation ( [ rju ] ) does not constrain neither the acceleration nor the metric of @xmath68 , but , on the other hand , it imposes the natural condition according to which there is no energy flux in static spacetimes as seen from static observers .",
    "now , in order to proceed further , it is important to find a relation between the scalar curvature of @xmath69 and the intrinsic scalar curvature of @xmath84 with the help of equations ( [ rij]),([rju]),([ruu ] ) , it can be shown that @xmath179    now , equations ( [ rij]),([rju]),([ruu ] ) and ( [ r ] ) permit us to examine the decomposition of the einstein tensor . it is not difficult to check that the components of the einstein tensor can be written as@xmath180 where we are using again the notation @xmath181 .    in the previous sections",
    ", we deal with acceleration fields described by functions of a unique coordinate , by virtue of the symmetries of the congruence .",
    "thus , in order to make contact with the previous discussion , let us admit that the static spacetime exhibit additional symmetries .",
    "so suppose that @xmath69 possesses a spacelike killing vector field @xmath182 orthogonal to the vector field @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , let us admit that it commutates with the time - translation generator , @xmath118 .",
    "of course , this means that @xmath182 satisfies the equation : @xmath183    we shall show that @xmath182 is also orthogonal to @xmath172 . indeed , taking the inner product with @xmath118 and using the killing equation for @xmath182 ,",
    "the above equation gives @xmath184 , which , recalling the equation ( [ a ] ) , implies the orthogonality condition:@xmath185    as consequence , we shall see that @xmath182 is a vector that belongs to the tangent space of the level surfaces of the function @xmath121 .",
    "indeed , in any one of the hypersurfaces of @xmath69 that are orthogonal to the timelike killing vector field @xmath118 , ( remember that these hypersurfaces are isometric 3-manifolds , since they do not evolve in a static spacetime ) , the equation @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is some positive constant , defines a level surface of the function @xmath121 , which we denote by @xmath188 . of course equation ( [ a ] )",
    "implies that @xmath172 is perpendicular to this level surface .",
    "thus , considering that @xmath182 is also orthogonal to @xmath118 , the equation ( [ xa ] ) leads us to conclude that @xmath182 lies in the tangent space of @xmath188 for some @xmath187 .",
    "this holds in every point of @xmath69 .    in general",
    ", the norm of acceleration vector @xmath172 may vary in the surface @xmath189 however , it is easy to show that , in the direction of killing field @xmath190 the derivative of the norm @xmath191 is null:@xmath192    if there exist at least two linearly independent killing field like this vector @xmath182 , then , as they will span the two - dimensional tangent space of @xmath188 , it follows that derivative of @xmath0 is zero along any tangent direction of @xmath188 .",
    "in other words , this means that @xmath188 is also a level surface for the acceleration @xmath193 therefore , we can write@xmath194 for some function @xmath195 .",
    "now consider the normal vector of @xmath188 , i.e , @xmath196 since @xmath188 is a level surface of @xmath0 , the gradient of @xmath0 is co - linear to @xmath197 .",
    "this fact allows us to write@xmath198 based on this and also on the condition @xmath199 ( that follows directly from equation ( [ a ] ) ) , we can verify that @xmath197 satisfies the geodesic equation@xmath200 as the embedding of @xmath68 into @xmath69 has null extrinsic curvature then the above equation is equivalent to @xmath201 , i.e. , the vector @xmath202 satisfies the geodesic equation with respect to the induced geometry of the hypersurface @xmath84    let us now explore the consequences of this condition . pick a certain value for @xmath203 as we know , associated to this value corresponds a particular level surface @xmath188 .",
    "let @xmath204 and @xmath205 be intrinsic coordinates of @xmath188 .",
    "solving the equation ( [ geo ] ) for geodesics that cross @xmath188 perpendicularly in every point , we can use the affine parameter of these curves , @xmath2 , together with coordinates@xmath206 , to build a gaussian normal coordinate system adapted to @xmath188 in its neighborhood .",
    "it follows that , in these new coordinate system , @xmath207 depends exclusively on @xmath2 .    to check this",
    ", first note that , in these coordinates , @xmath208 .",
    "now , from the normalization condition for @xmath197 , conveniently written as @xmath209 and recalling equation ( [ a ] ) and ( [ afv ] ) , we find the equation@xmath210 if we assume , as initial condition , that @xmath207 is a uniform function in that chosen surface @xmath211 , then , it follows , from the solution of equation ( [ eqvrho ] ) , that , in some neighborhood of @xmath188 , @xmath207 is a function of coordinate @xmath2 only .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath212 .    therefore the spacetime metric , written in these coordinates , assume the following simple form@xmath213 where the capital indices have the following range @xmath214 = 1,2 .",
    "we should note that , depending on the commutation relation between the killing fields that lies in @xmath188 , the induced metric @xmath215 in the level surfaces may admit extra simplifications .",
    "for instance , schwarzschild metric is a special case of ( [ metricrho ] ) in which level surfaces has spherical symmetry .    now considering the metric in this special form ( [ metricrho ] ) , we are led to examine the question of classifying the possible sources of this kind of spacetime . in other words , we have to faced the task of characterizing the energy - momentum of matter distributions that could generate such metrics .",
    "in particular we are interested in determining the conditions the energy - momentum tensor should satisfy in order to static observers in a curved space have the same acceleration , @xmath216 as the rindler observers in minkowski spacetime .    the better approach to deal with this question",
    "is to express @xmath217 and @xmath218 that appears in the equations ( [ guu ] ) , ( [ giu ] ) and ( [ gij ] ) , in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of the level surfaces @xmath188 , applying the embedding formalism again . making some minor adjustment , the same procedure previously described can be repeated and now it yields the following equations@xcite : @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the spacelike normal vector of the level surfaces @xmath188 , @xmath221 is the induced covariant derivative compatible with the induced metric @xmath215 of @xmath188 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the intrinsic einstein tensor and scalar curvature of @xmath188 surfaces respectively , the symmetric tensor @xmath224 is the extrinsic curvature of the level surfaces embedded in @xmath68 and finally @xmath225 is the analogue of @xmath226 ( see equation ( [ e ] ) ) relative to the embedding of the level surfaces @xmath188 into the hypersurface @xmath68 .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that , in order to deduce these relations , we had to handle the tensor @xmath227 whose definition@xmath228 is the two - dimensional analogue of ( [ e ] ) . by using the fact that @xmath220 satisfies the geodesic equation ,",
    "we could show , from the definition of the riemann tensor , that@xmath229 another useful relation we have employed too was the following formula ( valid in the gaussian coordinate system):@xmath230    now , before we introduce the energy - momentum tensor into the einstein equations , let us make one additional assumption concerning the geometry of the spacetime @xmath69 . for the sake of simplicity , henceforth we shall admit that the level surfaces @xmath188 are maximally symmetric spaces . as a consequence ,",
    "the riemann tensor and the extrinsic curvature reduce to these simple forms@xmath231 where @xmath232 and @xmath233 ( trace of extrinsic curvature ) do not depend on the intrinsic coordinates of @xmath211 but may depend on @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath234 determines completely the intrinsic geometry of the level surfaces .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath235 is positive , null or negative then , the geometry of @xmath188 is spherical , plane or hyperbolic , respectively .",
    "a direct consequence of this assumption is that the einstein tensor can be totally written as a function of the proper acceleration , the scalar curvature and extrinsic curvature of @xmath188 surfaces in the following form : @xmath236 \\gamma_{ab } \\label{eab}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denote derivative with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "we should also note that , due to the bianchi identities , the scalar curvature and the extrinsic curvature of the maximally symmetric surfaces @xmath188 must satisfy the equation:@xmath237    based on the form of the einstein tensor , we can conclude that the most general source of this special class of static spacetimes ( in which the level surfaces of the norm of static observers acceleration are maximally symmetric two - dimensional spaces ) is a non - viscous fluid described by the following energy - momentum tensor@xmath238 where @xmath239 is the energy density , @xmath240 is the pressure in the parallel direction to acceleration of static observers and @xmath241 is the pressure in the orthogonal direction relative to @xmath220 .",
    "all the quantities are measured by the static observers .    combining equations ( [ euu])-([eab ] ) and ( [ t ] )",
    ", the einstein equations reduces to @xmath242    besides , the fluid must satisfies , as a consequence of the energy - momentum conservation , the following equation@xmath243    once these equations have been established , we are now in an appropriate position to attack the problem concerning the existence of a curved static spacetime in which the rindler law is reproduced exactly . as we have seen , the inverse law is satisfied in the schwarzschild spacetime only approximately by those static observes who are near the horizon .",
    "now , we want to investigate whether there is any source capable of generating a spacetime where the acceleration of static observer is precisely given by @xmath117 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath244 for a rindler acceleration and , then , the equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) allow us to write the extrinsic and intrinsic curvature directly in terms of the energy density and the pressures of the fluid as @xmath245   ^{2 } \\label{r2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the energy density and the pressures are not totally independent since they must satisfy the conservation equation . a simple solution of equation ( [ conservation ] )",
    "is obtained by taking the following state equation@xmath246 where @xmath247 is a uniform energy density that should be positive in order to satisfy the weak energy condition .",
    "these polytropic state equations imply , according to equations ( [ omega ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) , that the level surfaces have null extrinsic curvature @xmath248 and a positive intrinsic curvature given by @xmath249 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these are sufficient conditions to completely determine the curvature of this particular spacetime @xmath69 . indeed , by using the embedding formalism",
    ", we can show that the non - null components of the riemann tensor are reduced to these following components@xmath250 where @xmath251 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 is flat only in the empty space .",
    "if @xmath247 is non - null , then , @xmath69 is curved and it is such that static observers follow the rindler acceleration law .",
    "finally , let us make some comments concerning the source of this special spacetime .",
    "as it is well known , the state equation @xmath252 is characteristic of a cosmological term or of an energy - momentum tensor related to a field that is found in a false vacuum state .",
    "the state equation ( [ pressurep ] ) shows a similar dependence between the parallel pressure and energy density , however because of ( [ pressureo ] ) it is clear that the fluid is not isotropic .",
    "hence , we may say that the source is a kind of anisotropic false vacuum state .",
    "it is worthy of mention that some inflationary models speculate about the possibility that the universe has passed through such rather exotic phase at the early stages of the cosmic evolution @xcite .",
    "in curved static spacetime , static observers have a non - zero proper acceleration . from their perspective",
    ", free - falling bodies are accelerated due to the attraction of a local gravitational field .",
    "because of this interpretation and motivated by the equivalence principle , we have studied congruences , defined in minkowski spacetime , composed of timelike curves whose acceleration field coincides to the acceleration field of the static observers .",
    "our purpose is to simulate in the non - inertial frame defined in minkowski spacetime some aspects of the gravitational field that is experienced by static observers in curved spaces .",
    "the embedding of the simultaneity hypersurfaces adapted to the non - inertial frame associated to the congruences , which is an important element in this context , was determined explicitly for any acceleration field , based on the locality principle .",
    "we have also investigated the induced geometry of the simultaneity hypersurfaces , determining explicitly the induced metric and the intrinsic riemann tensor .",
    "the particular case of the schwarzschild spacetime was investigated in detail .",
    "the simultaneity sections were determined and illustrated in fig .",
    "this figure shows clearly that the congruence is equivalent to the rindler frame only near the event horizon fig .",
    "while that , at large distances , it behaves like a congruence whose acceleration field obeys the inverse square law ( see fig.(2 ) ) .",
    "we have also obtained the field equation that regulates the behavior of accelerated field of static observers from the einstein equations .",
    "we have shown that this equation can be understood as the relativistic version of the newtonian gravitational field equation . as we have seen , according to this equation the divergence ( calculated with respect to the induced geometry of the simultaneity hypersurface ) of the acceleration field depends on the effective energy density ( energy density plus the trace of energy - momentum tensor ) and on the norm squared of the acceleration field .",
    "the presence of this non - linear term is clearly a consequence of the self - interacting property of gravity in the relativistic regime .    when the spacetime is characterized by the fact that level surfaces of the proper acceleration are maximally symmetric spaces , the field equations are simplified and",
    "can be totally expressed in terms of the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of the level surfaces and the acceleration field .",
    "the general form of tensor - energy momentum tensor of the possible sources for this kind of static spacetime was determined .",
    "we have seen that it corresponds to a non - viscous fluid totally characterized by the energy density , the parallel pressure and orthogonal pressure , which , in principle , may be different .",
    "when the state equation of the fluid is that of an anisotropic false vacuum state , the produced spacetime has curvature and it is such that static observes are accelerated exactly according to the inverse law characteristic of the rindler congruence .",
    "here we have a list of figures illustrating the embedding of the simultaneity hypersurfaces into minkowski spacetime adapted to different congruences of accelerated observers .    [ h ! ]    invrho.eps    [ h ! ]    invrho2.eps    [ h ! ]    aconst.eps    [ h ! ]    aschw.eps",
