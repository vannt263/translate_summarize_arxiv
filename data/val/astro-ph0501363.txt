    "the main obstacle to identifying the progenitor of a core - collapse ( @xmath010 @xmath1 ) supernova ( sn ) is that the sn leaves few traces of the star that exploded . before now ,",
    "only five out of ( at the time of this writing ) nearly 3000 historical extragalactic sne have had their progenitors directly identified .",
    "these include sn 1961v in ngc 1058 ( zwicky 1964 , 1965 ) , sn 1978k in ngc 1313 ( ryder et al .",
    "1993 ) , sn 1987a in the lmc ( e.g. , gilmozzi et al .  1987 ; sonneborn , altner , & kirshner 1987 ) , sn 1993j in m81 ( aldering , humphreys , & richmond 1994 ; cohen , darling , & porter 1995 ) , and sn 1997bs in m66 ( van dyk et al .",
    "it should be noted that these five sne were all at least somewhat unusual , and both sne 1961v ( van dyk , filippenko , & li 2002 ) and 1997bs ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) may not have been actual sne .",
    "clearly , direct identification of the progenitors of additional core - collapse sne is essential .",
    "ideally , one pinpoints the exact sn location by comparing a late - time sn image with a pre - sn image .",
    "we got the ball rolling for this whole game by exploiting the superior spatial resolution afforded by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and identifying the sn 1997bs progenitor , by comparing archival wfpc2 images used to measure the cepheid distance to the host galaxy , in which the sn was clearly detected at late times , with an archival pre - sn f606w wfpc2 image ( van dyk et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we undertook a more extensive search to isolate the progenitors of 6 sne ii and 10 sne ib / c in wfpc2 images in van dyk , li , & filippenko ( 2003a ) . in that paper",
    "we recovered sne 1999dn , 2000c , and 2000ew at late times , but , unfortunately , their pre - sn images did not show a progenitor candidate at the sn position . for",
    "the other 13 sne the trick was determining the sn location on one of the four wfpc2 chips . to achieve the highest astrometric accuracy possible for all image data we had to measure the sn position on a kait image",
    "( see the contribution by filippenko for more on kait ) and then locate the sn site by applying an _ independent _ astrometric grid to the pre - sn image .",
    "we adopted 2mass ( with positional uncertainty @xmath2 ) as the basis for the grid for both the ground - based and _ hst _ images .",
    "once the sn site was located , photometry of the appropriate wfpc2 chip was performed using the routine hstphot ( dolphin 2000a , b ) with a 3@xmath3 detection threshold .",
    "we had possibly identified the progenitors of the sne ii 1999br , 1999ev , and 2001du as supergiant stars with @xmath4 mag , and the progenitors of the sne ib 2001b and 2001is as very luminous supergiants with @xmath5 to @xmath6 mag , as well as the progenitor of the sn ic 1999bu as a supergiant with @xmath7 mag . for all other sne in our sample",
    "we could only place limits on the progenitor absolute magnitude and color .",
    "six of the sne ( 1999an , 1999br , 1999ev , 2000ds , 2000ew , 2001b ) had been imaged in multiple bands with acs at late times by smartt and collaborators .",
    "these data became available in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "we had already recovered sn 2000ew , and , along with sne 1999an and 2000ds , we did not detect a sn progenitor in each pre - sn image .",
    "we also found we had not correctly identified the progenitor for sn 2001b ( the progenitor , in fact , is not detected in the pre - sn image ) . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we show that the limits which we are able to place on the progenitors of the sn ic 2000ew and the sn ib 2001b are not very restrictive .",
    "possibly the sn ib / c progenitors instead are massive interacting he star binaries ( e.g. , avila - reese 1993 ) , and the theoretical single - star evolutionary tracks shown are not relevant .",
    "for sn 2001du we isolated three possible candidate progenitor stars within the uncertainty of the measured sn position : one reddish star with a detection in both the f555w and f814w bands , and two stars with only f555w detections , implying bluer colors for these latter two stars ( van dyk et al .",
    "late - time multi - band wfpc2 sn images were obtained by smartt and collaborators .",
    "we had assumed that , since sn 2001du is of type ii - p , the most plausible candidate is the redder star .",
    "we used the late - time sn images , specifically the @xmath8 image , and found the sn position on the pre - sn images to be 0.70@xmath90.15 wf pixel ( @xmath10 ) northeast of one of the _ blue _ stars ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003b ) .",
    "thus , we concluded that the progenitor is not detected in the pre - sn images .",
    "we used the f555w and f814w pre - sn image detection limits to constrain the nature of the progenitor : adopting @xmath11 mag and distance modulus @xmath12 mag for sn 2001du , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mag for the progenitor star .",
    "these limits were converted to the likely supergiant progenitor luminosity , assuming the full range of possible stellar surface temperatures ( drilling & landolt 2000 ) .",
    "stars with luminosities brighter than these limits should have been detected in the pre - sn images .",
    "we compared the limits to model stellar evolutionary tracks for a metallicity appropriate for the sn environment and for a range of masses , and estimated that the sn progenitor mass is @xmath15 , which is consistent with the mass limits on other previous sne ii - p .",
    "see smartt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for a similar result for sn 2001du . also see the estimate for the sn 2004dj progenitor by maiz - apellaniz et al .",
    "using a precise sn position from ground - based images , we isolated the sn position on pre - sn archival wfpc2 images to @xmath16 ( @xmath96 wf pixels ) .",
    "two stars , a and b , were detected near or within the error circle .",
    "color information for both progenitor candidates were obtained from a high - quality , ground - based @xmath17-band image , on which two faint objects are seen near the positions of both a and b. both stars are red supergiants , and from model evolutionary tracks for above - solar metallicity , assuming @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 mag for sn 2003gd , star b had initial mass @xmath20 ( formally below the theoretical lower limit for core - collapse sne ) , and star a had @xmath219 @xmath1 .",
    "although star a is farther from the sn position we measured than is star b , and just outside the edge of the error circle , star a was considered the most plausible progenitor candidate , based on its initial mass and the fact that it was the brightest @xmath17-band object within the sn s larger , @xmath221 radius , environment ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003c ) .",
    "this identification was confirmed via late - time _ hst _ imaging of the sn by smartt et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who arrive at the same conclusion for the progenitor s initial mass .",
    "( see the contributions by hendry and maund to these proceedings . )",
    "nomoto et al .  ( 2004 ) argued that the faint sne ii - p 1997d and 1999br ( e.g. , zampieri et al .",
    "2003 ) are highly massive ( @xmath2330 @xmath1 ) , `` failed '' sne ( presumably a massive envelope smothers the core - collapse energy release ) . to the contrary ,",
    "when the luminosity of the possible progenitor of sn 1999br progenitor seen in _",
    "hst _ images ( van dyk et al .",
    "2003a ) is placed in context with stellar evolution models ( figure 3 ) , and the progenitor is assumed to be a red supergiant , the upper mass limit is @xmath241215 @xmath1 .",
    "( a similar result is found even if the candidate star we identified was _ not _ the progenitor , and we can only place an upper limit on the progenitor luminosity . )",
    "as mentioned above , a growing number of sne have been shown to likely not be sne at all , but are more likely analogs of @xmath25 car .",
    "these so - called `` sn impostors '' include sne 1961v and 1997bs , but also sn 2002 kg , among others .",
    "we ( van dyk et al .  1999 ; see our figure 7a ) discovered the sn 1997bs progenitor in archival f606w images of ngc 3627 from 1994 dec , at @xmath26 mag . for the distance modulus to the host and a revised estimate of extinction , we ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) found an absolute magnitude @xmath27 , which is consistent with it having been an extremely luminous supergiant star .",
    "unfortunately , no color information exists for this star .",
    "we can constrain its initial mass by comparing this luminosity and a range of possible supergiant surface temperatures ( drilling & landolt 2000 ) to stellar evolutionary tracks ; see figure 4 .",
    "the minimum mass allowed by the luminosity , for @xmath28 k , is @xmath29 .",
    "if the precursor was a blue supergiant , however , the mass can range up to 120 @xmath30 or more .",
    "the precursor of sn 2002 kg has been identified in high quality , multi - band ground - based , pre - outburst images of the host galaxy .",
    "the star had been previously identified by tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) as the `` irregular blue variable '' v37 , which had an erratic @xmath31 light curve over several decades .",
    "the star had @xmath32 mag and unreddened colors consistent with a very luminous ob supergiant ( the spectra at outburst resemble those of known b - type lbvs ) . placing the star on a h - r diagram",
    "we conclude that @xmath33 for the star ( unfortunately , the photometric uncertainties do not allow this mass to be more tightly constrained ) .",
    "this is the first time that an @xmath25 car analog has had its initial mass accurately estimated .",
    "we are continuing our search for core - collapse sn progenitors in high - quality ( mainly , _ hst _ ) images . the possible detections and constraints on the sn ii progenitors are broadly consistent with red supergiants as progenitor stars , with their colors implying spectral types typically m or somewhat earlier .",
    "in fact , sne ii - p progenitors appear to have @xmath34 .",
    "the sn ii - p 2003gd progenitor is only the sixth ever directly identified , with @xmath35@xmath36 .",
    "the data so far for the progenitors of sne ib / c are inadequate ; we are unable to place rigorous constraints on either the wolf - rayet star or massive interacting binary models for the progenitors of these sne ib / c , the most extreme examples of which have been associated with some grbs ( see matheson , these proceedings )",
    ". direct identification of the progenitors of sne ib / c is of the utmost importance , given this connection .",
    "the sne iin are a very heterogeneous group , a topic that deserves considerably more discussion elsewhere .",
    "some sne iin are `` sn impostors , '' which are more likely superoutbursts of very massive evolved stars , similar to @xmath25 car .",
    "this is borne out by the identification of the sn 2002 kg progenitor , or precursor , with @xmath33 .",
    "if sn 2002 kg is instead a real sn ( which we doubt ) , then its progenitor is only the seventh , out of 1000 s , to be directly identified .",
