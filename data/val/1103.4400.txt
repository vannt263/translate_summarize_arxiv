    "in the context of quantum field theory ( qft ) the term `` entanglement entropy '' usually refers to the entropy @xmath0 of the vacuum state reduced to a region @xmath1 of the space .",
    "it essentially measures the entropy contained in the vacuum fluctuations in this region .",
    "the interest in this subject arose initially from an interpretation of the black hole entropy in terms of entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "later , several different applications have been developed , showing that the entanglement entropy of the vacuum contains information on important aspects of the qft , including renormalization flow @xcite , topological order @xcite , phase transitions @xcite and confinement @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility of using the entanglement entropy as a tool for developing the ads - cft dictionary has attracted much interest @xcite .    in contrast with the more intuitive idea of the entropy of a substance contained in a box , which under normal circumstances persists on time",
    ", the entanglement entropy of a region has to be defined for a fixed instant of time ( see figure ( [ paralelas ] ) ) . after this moment",
    ", the reduced state on the region @xmath1 will spread out at the velocity of light . in order to impede this spreading , some material box imposing boundary conditions would be necessary .",
    "but this is not what we are willing to do , since this further element , the boundary condition , spoils the very nature of the entanglement entropy , of being a quantity depending _ only _ on the geometry of @xmath1 and the particular qft .",
    "therefore entanglement entropy has to be thought as a quantity localized in space - time @xcite . in the relativistic case",
    ", @xmath1 can be any @xmath2-dimensional spatial region ( in a @xmath3-dimensional space - time ) , included as a part of a cauchy surface , but not necessarily contained in a flat spatial hyperplane .",
    "this space - time nature of entanglement entropy is fundamental to the entropic c - theorem in two dimensions @xcite , but has otherwise not received much attention in the literature .    this may be attributed to the fact that if @xmath1 is not contained in a single spatial hyperplane the usual euclidean method to compute entanglement entropy based on the replica trick becomes inapplicable in a direct way .",
    "a @xmath2-dimensional surface in euclidean space corresponds to a @xmath2-dimensional spatial surface in minkowski only if this is a flat surface .",
    "otherwise , the minkowskian result should follow from the euclidean one through a complicated analytic continuation in the space of regions .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the behavior of the entanglement entropy for non coplanar regions in the simplest qft model given by a free fermion in two dimensions .",
    "we choose a fermion field instead of a scalar one , since this later involves the treatment of more singular kernels @xcite , and in addition , in the two dimensional case it develops an infrared divergence in the massless limit .",
    "we use a real time method based on the explicit expression of the reduced density matrix for the free case @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy for several disjoint intervals lying on a single spatial line was calculated in @xcite using this approach and a small mass expansion .",
    "we extend these techniques here to obtain the general result for non coplanar sets involving relatively boosted intervals .",
    "the entanglement entropy in qft contains divergences which are proportional to local terms on the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "the regularization independent information can be isolated using the mutual information function @xmath4 for two disjoint regions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this quantity has the interpretation of the amount of shared information between these regions , and is always positive .",
    "it is also increasing with the size of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and it gives an upper bound on correlations between these two sets .",
    "we calculate this function in some specific approximation , and find that this shared information can be greatly increased by the relative boosts between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . surprisingly , the boost enhancement is such that the mutual information remains no zero for zero volume sets , provided they lie on null surfaces .",
    "an important physical problem which naturally involves the entanglement between regions with a large relative boost is the localization of information in the hawking radiation process , in the semiclassical regime . indeed , the entropy in the hawking radiation is entanglement entropy with the region hidden across the horizon .",
    "the entropy in the hawking radiation contained in a finite region of space is rather small and can not be isolated from the area terms in the entanglement entropy , which are regularization dependent @xcite .",
    "this can be overcome using a regularization independent measure of information .",
    "a natural choice is @xmath7 , being @xmath5 the black hole ( or some piece of it near the bifurcation surface ) and @xmath6 a region far outside the black hole , containing hawking radiation .",
    "these two regions are related by an exponentially large redshift , which arguably may be simulated by a large relative boost in flat space .",
    "physical intuition dictates that the information in the radiation region should be spatially extensive , at least for regions which are far from the black hole and are large with respect to the typical radiation wavelength .",
    "this property of extensivity is however non mathematically guaranteed because mutual information is in general a non extensive quantity @xcite .",
    "the deviation from extensivity is measured by the tripartite information @xmath8 which is zero in the extensive case @xmath9 .",
    "thus , an important question related to the entanglement entropy for non coplanar surfaces is whether an extreme lorentzian geometry may guide us to find a general principle making the mutual information extensive .",
    "we study this question with our toy qft model .",
    "the massless fermion in two dimensions has extensive mutual information , but this property fails for massive fields @xcite . in the black hole interpretation ,",
    "the presence of a mass in two dimensions connects the ingoing and outgoing modes , and simulates the backscattering which occurs for massless fields in more than two dimensions .",
    "we find here that some special configurations with high relative boosts between the different components can restore extensivity in the massive case .",
    "we relate this property to large violations of the triangle inequalities for the involved distances , which are allowed by the lorentzian geometry .",
    "these large violations of the triangle inequalities are also a key ingredient of the black hole evaporation geometry .",
    "in a two dimensional space - time @xmath1 is a spacelike curve , which can have several connected components .",
    "we are interested in a free dirac field @xmath10 , and write @xmath11 for the field @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a parameterization of the points of @xmath1 by the distance parameter @xmath14 along the curve .",
    "the general expression of the reduced density matrix @xmath15 , corresponding to the global vacuum state , and the region @xmath1 , was obtained in @xcite in terms of the field correlator .",
    "we will not need this expression here , but only the corresponding one to the associated entanglement entropy @xmath0 .",

    "we are using a @xmath24 signature for the metric ( time - like vectors have positive square ) .",
    "this result , as well as the explicit expression for the density matrix , follows from the requirement @xmath25 for any operator @xmath26 localized in @xmath1 , together with the very simple structure of the vacuum expectation value for the field polynomials in the free case @xcite .",
    "the density matrix and the entropy require regularization .",
    "a more rigorous treatment based on the kms condition is in @xcite .",
    "the density matrix represents the vacuum state on the whole algebra of operators localized in @xmath1 . because of causality ,",

    "we know the entropy is independent of this choice , but this is reflected in that the whole contribution @xmath100 is curve - independent , while @xmath124 and @xmath126 separately are not .",

    "the separating interval @xmath2 can be positioned on the @xmath147 axis without loss of generality . in order to completely fix the configuration we have to specify two more parameters , the hyperbolic angles @xmath148 and @xmath116 , determining the relative boosts of @xmath5 and @xmath6 with respect to the separating interval .",

    "however , if we take the limit of zero size , but at the same time increase the modulus of the boost parameters @xmath148 and @xmath116 such that the null coordinate projections of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are kept finite , then the mutual information takes a finite limit value .",
    "two different cases have to be considered .",
    "these are shown in figure ( [ f33 ] ) .",
    "first the limit in which @xmath153 and @xmath154 , while @xmath155 , in such a way that @xmath149 and @xmath151 are finite . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath156 ( figure([f33])a ) .",
    "the case of vanishing @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) is analogous .",
    "the massless contribution to the entropy does not vanish in this case , and we have @xmath160 only the cross ratio of the @xmath161 projections matter to this massless contribution .",
    "two different ingredients seem to be necessary for an explanation of this result .",
    "first , the quantum field theory contains infinite many d.o.f . in any finite volume region of any size",
    "this is important , otherwise the number of d.o.f .",
    "would vanish in the zero volume limit diverges when @xmath5 and @xmath6 come into contact for generic @xmath5 and @xmath6 . ] . here",
    ", it also seems important that in the massless limit the theory decomposes into the two chiralities and is conformally invariant .",
    "hence , the plus chirality acts as a one dimensional translational invariant system independent of the minus chirality , and the finite result for @xmath7 is a consequence of the finite values of @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath162 .",
    "the physical size of the @xmath142 and @xmath143 intervals is of course zero in the limit , but in a conformal theory there is the same amount of shared information in any rescaled geometric configuration .",
    "thus , the explanation in terms of the conformal limit is that @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath2 tend to zero , but only the ratios of their projections in the @xmath64 axis are relevant .",
    "however , such an explanation combining chiral decomposition with invariance under scaling is helpless in our next example .",
    "the second case we want to consider is a limit @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath158 finite ( see figure ( [ f33])b ) . in this case",
    "the conformal contribution vanishes , and the leading log term is given by @xmath99 , @xmath166 again we have a non zero mutual information for zero volume regions .",
    "this case is perhaps more surprising than the previous one since no interpretation as entanglement between small but nearby regions seems possible .",
    "it suggests that amplification of entanglement by the large relative boost is a genuine effect that can lead to finite shared information for vanishing small regions separated by a finite , fixed distance .    in order to clarify the role of the massless limit in this phenomenon we can look at a different limit for the two boosted intervals",
    "this is a large separating distance limit , when @xmath167 and @xmath168 , but not necessarily @xmath169 .",
    "thus , at leading order one uses the massless correlator inside the intervals , and considers the correlator between points on @xmath5 and @xmath6 as a constant .",
    "the calculation then involves the same tools used in the previous section .",
    "the main steps are explained in @xcite , and we do not repeat this calculation here .",
    "we have for two intervals in the limit of large separation @xmath170 the first term of the right hand side corresponds to the continuation of ( [ corto ] ) to a large separating distance configuration , while the second term corresponds to the continuation of ( [ miro ] ) .",
    "formula ( [ hghg ] ) clarifies two issues .",
    "first , it is clear that the phenomenon of finite mutual information between null surfaces regions extends out of the conformal limit , for both configurations in the figure ( [ f33 ] ) .",
    "second , since the configurations include large dimensionless boost parameters , one could wonder if the perturbative series is behaving correctly in ( [ corto ] ) , and if it converges .",
    "this was expected , because the large boost parameters appear in the series only in terms of the distances involved and their ratios , which are all finite and bounded .",
    "the formula ( [ hghg ] ) extending the result ( [ corto ] ) to a different situation , clarifies this expectation is correct .",
    "this behavior of the mutual information for null surfaces is connected with related properties for the correlation functions .",
    "the mutual information is a bound for correlations @xcite , @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are normal operators in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath174 is the norm of the operator @xmath26 ( the greatest eigenvalue modulus ) .",
    "for the fermion field consider the hermitian operators ( [ op ] ) , being fermionic , is not really localized in @xmath5 , since it does not commute with @xmath173 for example .",
    "however , the application of ( [ versi ] ) is easily generalized to the fermionic case , and it does only require the expectation value of these operators to be given by the corresponding traces involving the density matrices . ]",
    "+ @xmath175 where @xmath176 for @xmath177 , and @xmath178 for @xmath179 . since the square of these operators are c - numbers , we have for the norms @xmath180 and analogously for @xmath173 .",
    "we also have , @xmath181 and @xmath182 then , using the cauchy - schwartz inequality , we have for the right hand side of ( [ versi ] ) @xmath183 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the lengths of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath184 is the maximum of the norm of @xmath185 for @xmath186 , and @xmath187 is the maximum of the absolute value of the eigenvalues of correlator between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . then , if the slope of the curve is bounded , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are bounded according to ( [ etaeta ] ) .",
    "there is no possibility for ( [ labe ] ) but to vanish when @xmath190 or @xmath191 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath192 in these cases .",
    "however , if @xmath155 but @xmath193 remains finite ( or diverges ) in the limit , one can produce a non zero lower bound for the mutual information through ( [ versi ] ) .",
    "this is clearly what happens when one takes @xmath194 , but keeping their projections @xmath195 finite .",
    "hence , in the language of operators our observation is that boosts allow for a large relative enhancing of operator correlations as compared to operator norm .",
    "we have chosen to put @xmath2 horizontal in figure ( [ f33 ] ) without loss of generality . in the case of @xmath196 ,",
    "the mutual information is either divergent or ambiguous .",
    "this last possibility is exemplified by the case @xmath197 , i.e. @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath198 all tend to lie in a null surface .",
    "the mutual information ( [ miro ] ) depends in this case on the ratios of @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 as they tend to zero .",
    "now we turn attention to the analysis of the extensivity properties of the mutual information .    the first thing to note",
    "is that in general the relative importance of the non extensivity with respect to the mutual information does not necessarily decrease with decreasing correlations . for example , in the configuration of three coplanar intervals of figure ( [ hory ] ) , the mutual information is dominated by the massless contribution ( [ miro ] ) ( we take @xmath202 ) , while @xmath203 is given by the leading massive term ( [ exphor ] ) .",
    "then we have , @xmath204 this is increasing with the distance @xmath2 , at least in the range @xmath205 .",
    "a partial understanding for this non - extensivity for the configuration of the figure ( [ hory ] ) follows from the geometry .",
    "the typical distances @xmath206 while @xmath207 .",
    "this is a typical euclidean regime , where the triangle inequalities are satisfied . in this case",
    "the geometry can not enforce extensivity for the mutual information .",
    "this is because while @xmath5 is correlated similarly with @xmath6 and @xmath141 , the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath141 is higher or similar to the one they have with @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is not entangled independently with @xmath6 and @xmath141 , but rather there is an important part of the correlations which are truly tripartite , as shown by the actual calculation of @xmath203 ( see ( [ iu ] ) ) .    in this same line of thought",
    ", one could expect that if there is a condition enforcing extensivity which is general enough to be useful to the applications on black hole physics , the configuration has to be largely non - euclidean , with great violations of the triangle inequalities in the distances .",
    "a possibility is to search for situations where @xmath208 .",
    "this is typically the case of the hawking radiation , with large and uncorrelated asymptotic regions ( represented by @xmath6 and @xmath141 ) which are however correlated with the black hole ( represented by @xmath5 ) . in this case",
    "the state @xmath209 is well approximated by a product state .",
    "this is still not equivalent to extensivity since in this case ( @xmath210 ) one has only a one sided inequality , @xmath211 here we have used the monotonicity property of the mutual information , @xmath212 . in the context of quantum entanglement",
    "measures a relation like this one , which corresponds to @xmath213 for the entanglement measure @xmath214 , has been called monogamy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "some entanglement measures ( for example the squashed entanglement @xcite ) always satisfy this inequality .",
    "this is not the case of the mutual information , which also measures classical correlations , and in general is non - monogamous , excepting special situations as the one we are focusing here .    in order to have @xmath208 we need in general that @xmath215 , a deeply lorenzian regime .",
    "the figure ( [ f44])a shows one such a configuration",
    ". we again have three intervals @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath141 parallel to the @xmath147 axes but now there is a high relative boost between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath5 and @xmath141 , with opposite signs .",
    "specifically , we write the interval between the right - most point in @xmath141 and the left - most point in @xmath5 as @xmath216 , and the interval between the right - most point in @xmath5 and the left - most point in @xmath6 to be @xmath217 .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the non - extensivity as a function of @xmath148 .",
    "the typical distances are @xmath218 , and @xmath219 for large @xmath148 .",
    "an example with @xmath220 and several values of @xmath2 is shown in figure ( [ fesi ] ) .",
    "the relevant entropy contributions to @xmath203 , computed by eqs .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) and ( [ delta3 ] ) are given by integrals in one variable .",
    "we evaluate them numerically .",
    "we see the relative tripartite information starts negative for small @xmath148",
    ". then , with increasing boost it changes sign and peaks with a positive value . for large boost parameter",
    "@xmath148 it decreases asymptotically like @xmath221 .",
    "hence , our expectations are confirmed in this simple example where the mutual information is extensive in the limit of large relative boosts .",
    "it is interesting to note that well in the large boost situation the tripartite information is positive , violating the strict monogamy relation @xmath222 .",
    "this is good , since when this relation holds we necessarily have extensivity in the limit of large @xmath148 because @xmath223 .",
    "note also that the case of fixed @xmath148 and increasing @xmath2 does not lead to @xmath224 , similarly to what happens for the collinear case ( [ iu ] ) .",
    "this is expected in accordance with the fact that the distances @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 all increase proportional to @xmath2 in this case , and there are no large violations of the triangle inequalities .",
    "however , a connection between triangle inequalities and extensivity of information is not the whole story , and a further consideration of the relative boosts between the regions is necessary . consider the geometry of figure ( [ f44])b . in this case",
    "even if the configuration enhances the correlations of @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath141 over the one between @xmath6 and @xmath141 , by approaching @xmath5 and @xmath6 to a common null line , this is done in a non fully satisfactory way .",
    "we again take @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath141 parallel to the @xmath147 axis , the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 equal to @xmath2 , and the interval separating the right - most point of @xmath6 to the left - most point in @xmath5 to be @xmath228 .",
    "the typical distances are @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 for large @xmath148 .",
    "the figure ( [ fese ] ) shows an example with @xmath220 and several values of the separating distance @xmath2 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the relative importance of the non - extensivity , measured by @xmath232 .",
    "the mutual information @xmath7 is dominated by the massless contribution , which in the large @xmath148 limit behaves linearly @xmath233 .",
    "however , the tripartite information is linear in the boost factor @xmath234 , as shown in figure ( [ fese ] ) .",
    "therefore the relative non - extensivity grows rapidly with the boost .",
    "therefore , in this case , even if the triangle inequalities are largely violated we still do not have extensivity .",
    "the reason can be traced back to the fact that here large @xmath227 does not mean small @xmath235 .",
    "this is the same phenomenon we discussed in the last section .",
    "the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath141 increases as @xmath236 but the relative boost of @xmath6 and @xmath141 with respect to the separating interval is also proportional to this factor .",
    "in fact , the massless contribution gives a non vanishing @xmath235 in the limit of large @xmath148 . in order to have asymptotic extensivity",
    "a bound on the relative boosts seems to be necessary .",
    "we have obtained the entanglement entropy for a free fermion in two dimensions for a completely general relativistic region .",
    "this has been done in a small mass approximation .",
    "we found a large amplification of shared information by boosts .",
    "this gives a non zero mutual information between two sets of arbitrary small size at a fixed minimum distance between each other , provided the relative boost diverges in the limit of small size .",
    "a partial understanding of this behavior in terms of correlators was provided . in more dimensions",
    "the analog effect is a non zero mutual information between null surface regions .",
    "this effect can also be understood in terms of the operator product expansion ( ope ) of certain operators . in two dimensions",
    "the traces of integer powers of the reduced density matrix , @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is the renyi entropy of index @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath1 , can be written in terms of operator correlators @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath239 where @xmath240 contains @xmath241 intervals , and @xmath242 is the cpt conjugate of the field @xmath243 . in the euclidean formulation",
    "the fields @xmath244 are a special class of twisting operators @xcite .",
    "the entropy is a limit of the renyi entropies for index @xmath245 , and can be obtained by analytic continuation in the variable @xmath67 .",
    "then , it is expected ( and often found ) that the renyi entropies and the entropy have a similar behavior as functions of the coordinates . in this representation",
    "the limit of small size of the @xmath246 interval corresponds to the limit of the correlator in which there is a product @xmath247 for @xmath248 . in this limit",
    "we are able to use the ope @xcite @xmath249 which is proportional to the identity operator to leading order .",
    "hence , the limit of the renyi mutual information @xmath250 for sets containing an interval with vanishing small length emerges naturally from ( [ hhhh ] ) .",
    "this reads simply @xmath251 and @xmath252 where in the right hand side the marked points on the renyi mutual information argument are absent , and thus the first set has only @xmath253 intervals .",
    "that is , the vanishing small size interval just disappear from the argument of the mutual information .",
    "however , if we take the limit @xmath254 by approaching a null line ( while leaving all other points fixed ) the ope has a very different content .",
    "this is because boost and distance are scaled proportionally to each other in this limit , and the series involves an infinite number of operators of increasing dimension and spin even at leading order @xcite .",
    "the impossibility of replacing the product of the two approaching operators by a finite combination of operators at some given point is clearly seen for example in figure ( [ f33 ] ) .",
    "even if the two end points @xmath255 and @xmath256 of @xmath5 are at small distance from each other , their distances @xmath257 and @xmath258 from a point @xmath259 are very different .    based on the lessons learned so far from this model ,",
    "we are tempted to conjecture that the mutual information is extensive , @xmath224 , in the limit of large violation of the triangle inequalities @xmath215 , and when the relative boosts involved in the configuration of @xmath260 are kept bounded .",
    "this is the appropriate geometric scenario for analyzing the information shared by a black hole with the radiation region .",
    "indeed , we are also tempted to suggest that this may be a general effect , leading to information extensivity in the hawking radiation .",
    "a proof of this conjecture in minkowski space may involve the analysis of the clustering properties of the operators in this particular geometrical limit , and a more complete understanding of the relation between the mutual information and the correlators than the one provided by ( [ versi ] ) .",
    "this configuration corresponds to the ope in a limit involving several momentum becoming large simultaneously .",
    "this is reminiscent to @xcite , where the information content of hawking radiation was linked to the understanding of virtual particle collisions in the limit of very large centre of mass energies .",
    "in this appendix we display the spectral decomposition of the kernel @xmath76 ( with principal value regularization ) in a generic multi - interval set @xmath261 , and collect the properties of the eigenvectors , which are relevant to the calculations in the main text .",
    "most of these properties appear in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath262 , @xmath263 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath264 for any @xmath265 , are @xmath67-fold degenerate , where @xmath67 is the number of intervals .",
    "an explicit expression for an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors @xmath266 reads @xmath267 where @xmath268    the eigenvectors satisfy the orthonormality relations , @xmath269 besides we have the integrals @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the sum of the @xmath67 interval lengths .",
    "we also employ the useful algebraic identities @xmath272",
