    "lately , there has been considerable interest in low - dimensional quantum spin systems that exhibit frustration .",
    "the spin-1/2 chain with next - nearest - neighbor interactions ( which is equivalent to a zig - zag ladder ) is a typical model with the frustration .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spin-1/2 operator , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the nearest ( nn ) and the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions .",
    "this model with both nn and nnn antiferromagnetic interactions ( @xmath4 , @xmath6 ) is well studied @xcite .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath7 , which separates doubly degenerated dimer phase ( at @xmath8 ) characterized by the excitation gap and the gapless spin - fluid phase ( at @xmath9 ) .",
    "relatively less is known about the model ( [ h ] ) with the ferromagnetic nn and the antiferromagnetic nnn interactions ( @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "though the latter model has been a subject of many studies @xcite the complete picture of the phases of this model remains unclear up to now .",
    "it is known that the ground state is ferromagnetic for @xmath12 . at @xmath13 the ferromagnetic state",
    "is degenerated with the singlet state .",
    "the wave function of the singlet state at @xmath13 is known exactly @xcite .",
    "for @xmath14 the ground state is an incommensurate singlet .",
    "controversial conclusions exist about the presence of a gap at @xmath14 .",
    "it has been long believed that the model is gapless @xcite but the one - loop renormalization group analysis indicates @xcite that the gap is open due to a lorentz symmetry breaking perturbation .",
    "however , existence of the gap has not been verified numerically @xcite . on the basis of a field theory consideration",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that a very tiny but finite gap exists which can be not observed numerically .",
    "besides a general interest in frustrated quantum spin models there is an additional motivation for the study of the model ( [ h ] ) with @xmath15 . really , the ferromagnetic nn interaction is expected to exist in compounds containing @xmath16 chains with edge - sharing @xmath17 units .",
    "the @xmath18 angle in these compounds is close to @xmath19 , and usual antiferromagnetic nn exchange between @xmath20 ion spins is suppressed .",
    "this means that the sign of @xmath4 can be negative , while the nnn exchange is antiferromagnetic .",
    "several compounds with edge - sharing chains are known @xcite , such as @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 . however , in these compounds the antiferromagnetic long range order appears at low temperatures due to small interchain interactions .",
    "recently , the crystal @xmath1 with edge - sharing chains has been synthesized and studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "remarkably , no magnetic phase transition appears down to @xmath24 , which testifies that interchain interaction is very small in this compound .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 can be considered as an ideal model compound with the ferromagnetic ( nn ) interaction . according to @xcite",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "one of the interesting peculiarities of the model ( [ h ] ) is the dependence of the magnetization on the applied magnetic field at @xmath0 .",
    "the magnetization curve for @xmath15 is quite different from that for the case @xmath28 .",
    "it is characterized by a rapid increase ( or even discontinuity ) in the magnetization , if the external field exceeds a critical value .",
    "it is expected that the magnetization displays a true jump ( the metamagnetic transition ) when the nnn interaction @xmath5 is slightly larger than @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion has been made on the basis of the exact diagonalization calculations for finite chains .",
    "however , the extrapolation of these results to the thermodynamic limit is rather difficult due to strong non - monotonic finite size effects .    in this paper",
    "the ground state energy and the magnetization processes in the model ( [ h ] ) with @xmath15 are studied using two variational approaches .",
    "one of these approaches is based on the jordan - wigner transformation of spin-1/2 operators to the fermi ones with the subsequent mean - field treatment of the fermi - hamiltonian .",
    "another variational approach is applied to the bose - hamiltonian arising from a special transformation of spin operators to bose ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii the details of the jordan - wigner mean - field approximation are presented .",
    "the zero - temperature magnetization process is studied and the form of the magnetization curve in different region of the parameter @xmath30 is found . for the case",
    "@xmath31 we have focused on the behavior of the model in the vicinity of the transition point from the ferromagnetic to the singlet ground state .",
    "the critical exponents characterizing this behavior are determined . in section iii",
    "we describe the variational method for the treatment of the considered hamiltonian rewritten in bosonic form . scaling estimates of the critical exponent near the transition point",
    "are presented in section iv . in section",
    "v we summarize our results .",

    "we are not sure whether a true magnetization curve has ( or not ) the jump .",
    "however , we believe that the jump obtained in our approximation testifies the singular behavior of the magnetization at some critical field . a plausible reason of such singularity consists in the following physical picture . as was shown above at @xmath176 two magnons attract one another and form the bound two - magnon state ( [ psi ] ) with the correlation length @xmath187 ( [ xi ] ) . when the magnetic field is slightly lower than the saturated field @xmath130 and a number of magnons is small , the ground state can be represented with high accuracy as a product of  the bound magnon pairs , weakly interacted with each other .",

    "the experimental magnetization at @xmath192 demonstrates a sufficiently sharp increase up to @xmath193 at @xmath194 tesla followed by a gradual increase to the saturation . in the light of above mentioned one can assume that the sharp change in the behavior of @xmath149 at @xmath195 is connected with the transition from the incommensurate regime to the commensurate one .",
    "taking the values of @xmath4  and @xmath58 estimated for @xmath1  ( @xmath196 ) @xcite we obtain @xmath197 .",
    "another technique which can be used for an approximate analysis of the model ( [ h1 ] ) is the boson variational approach ( bva ) proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this approach is based on agranovich - toshich boson representation of spin @xmath198 operators @xcite : @xmath199 where @xmath200 are the bose operators .",
    "this transformation preserves all commutation relations for the spin operators and does not involve ` nonphysical states ' , because all states with odd number of bosons correspond to the same spin state @xmath201 and the states with even number of bosons correspond to the spin state @xmath202 .",
    "the latter implies that the transformation ( [ spin - boson ] ) is not unitary and each energy level of spin model corresponds to infinite degenerated level of boson hamiltonian .",
    "however , this transformation allows to estimate the ground state energy of the spin model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the considered spin model rewritten in the bosonic form is treated by the variational function in the form @xcite : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the boson vacuum state corresponding to the ferromagnetic spin state with all spins pointing up and the function @xmath205 is chosen by the condition of minimum of the total energy . therefore , in contrast to spin - wave theory , this approach is variational .",
    "the procedure of calculation of the variational energy with the wave function ( [ psi - boson ] ) and energy minimization over function @xmath206 was developed in @xcite , where the approach was successfully applied to construction of the ground state phase diagram of the frustrated 2d heisenberg model .",
    "we have applied the above approach to the rotated spin hamiltonian ( [ hrot ] ) and the rotation angles @xmath36 and @xmath38 was used as variational parameters , as was in the mfa .",
    "the contribution to the energy of the parts @xmath62 and @xmath207 of the hamiltonian ( [ hrot ] ) in this approach is also zero as in the mfa .",
    "we do not present here cumbersome details of calculations , because they are identical to those in ref.@xcite and give only the final results .",
    "the approach shows very similar behavior of the ground state energy as in the jordan - wigner mfa .",
    "that is , for small @xmath57 both approaches give the same critical exponent for the ground state energy and for the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the numerical estimates of the ground state energy in both approaches are also very close ( see fig.[fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization curve in the bva are also very similar to that in the mfa ( see fig.[fig_3 ] ) .",
    "the perfect coincidence of physical properties of the model predicted by the mfa and the bva looks somewhat surprising , because of different nature of these approaches .",
    "we note , that the potential advantage of the boson variational approach consists in its applicability to any dimension lattices and possible modification to any spin value @xmath3 .",
    "as was shown in previous sections the mfa and the bva gives the ground state energy @xmath209 near the transition point @xmath210 .",
    "since both approaches used are variational , the value @xmath211  is upper bound for the critical exponent @xmath212 .",
    "this implies an important and strict fact that quantum fluctuations definitely change the classical critical exponent @xmath109 .    nevertheless , there are some reasons to believe that true value of the critical exponent is @xmath213 .",
    "the arguments in favor of this conjecture are based on the following consideration with use of the results of numerical calculations of finite - size chains @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the model ( [ h1 ] ) is the singlet at @xmath214 for any  even @xmath215 . for cyclic chain there are number of level crossings of two lowest singlets with momenta @xmath216 and @xmath172 .",
    "for example , for @xmath217 there are @xmath218 crossing points @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "this fact means that in the thermodynamic limit the ground state is at least two - fold degenerated at @xmath220 .",
    "let us determine the dependence of @xmath221 ( actually , @xmath222 ) on @xmath215 .",
    "it is known this dependence defines the scaling parameter in one - dimensional models , where the crossings of two ground state levels occur . at @xmath223 @xmath224 the ground state in the sector @xmath225 has momentum @xmath172 , while the first excited state has @xmath216 and the excitation energy @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "the first order correction to the energy of these states in @xmath102 is @xmath227 where @xmath228 and @xmath229 are the wave functions of the ground state and the first excited singlet at @xmath55 .",
    "these two states have a spiral ordering at @xmath230 with a period of spirals @xmath215 and @xmath231 respectively @xcite . according to this fact the two - spin correlation functions at @xmath230 are @xmath232    the accuracy of the above equations for @xmath233 is of the order of @xmath234 @xcite .    the value @xmath235 is determined from the condition @xmath236 which gives @xmath237    therefore , the scaling parameter of the model ( [ h1 ] ) in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath55 is @xmath238 .",
    "it means that the perturbation theory in @xmath102 contains infrared divergencies and the ground state energy has a form @xmath239 where the scaling function @xmath240 at @xmath241 is given by the first order correction ( [ e1 ] ) . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath242 )",
    "the behavior of @xmath240 is generally unknown , but the condition @xmath243 at @xmath230 requires @xmath244    according to eqs.([e2])-([e3 ] ) @xmath213 .",
    "this value is close to @xmath107 which indicates high quality of the variational approaches used .",
    "a possible reason of a discrepancy between the variational and scaling estimates of the exponent may be related to the fact that in the variational approaches the terms @xmath62 and @xmath207 in eq.([hrot ] ) are irrelevant . _",
    "_  _ _ it can be also expected that the true dependences in eqs.([egamma]),([hs ] ) at small @xmath57 are @xmath245",
    "we have studied the frustrated spin-@xmath46 heisenberg chain with the nn ferromagnetic and the nnn antiferromagnetic exchange interactions using two different variational approximations : the mfa and the bva .",
    "the first step of both approaches consists in rotation of the coordinate system on the pitch angle @xmath36 and the canted angle @xmath38 , which are not equal to their classical values and used as variational parameters of the approaches .",
    "then , in the mfa the rotated spin hamiltonian is mapped into the model of interacting spinless fermions by means of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "the latter is treated in the mean - field approximation with the inclusion of superconductor - like correlations . within the bva we use the agranovich - toshich boson transformation of spin operators and the variational treatment of the bosonic hamiltonian . a remarkable fact , despite the difference of these approaches they give quantitatively close results .",
    "the variational approaches used allowed us to estimate the critical exponent of the ground state energy @xmath212 in the vicinity of the transition point from the ferromagnetic state to the singlet one .",
    "both approaches give @xmath246 which differs from the classical value @xmath109 .",
    "since approaches used are variational , we have established an important and strict fact that quantum fluctuations definitely change the classical critical exponent . using the results of finite - size calculations we presented also some scaling arguments in favor of the critical exponent @xmath213 .",
    "this value is close to @xmath107  which indicates high quality of the variational approaches used .",
    "_  _    the behavior of the magnetization curve is different in parameter regions @xmath247  and @xmath158 . in the region",
    "@xmath248  the metamagnetic transition to saturation takes place . at @xmath249 the magnetization increases with @xmath119  until the field reaches the critical value @xmath159 ,  where the magnetization jumps from @xmath250  to @xmath251 . this magnetization jump accompanies the jump of the pitch angle @xmath36 and canted angle @xmath38 . at @xmath180  both angles are incommensurate , while at @xmath165  they correspond to the commensurate phase @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , we associate this jump with the incommensurate - commensurate transition induced by the magnetic field .",
    "we believe that our approaches correctly predict the existence of the incommensurate - commensurate transition at some critical field @xmath159 and @xmath253 .",
    "this transition must accompany some singular behavior of the magnetization curve , though we are not sure whether the true magnetization has the jump at @xmath162 .    both approximations used yield the exact value of the saturation field at @xmath253 , though the field dependence near the saturation does not correspond to the expected universal square - root behavior .",
    "we note that the magnetization behavior near the saturation in the region of sufficiently large value of @xmath58  is described by the model ( [ hising ] ) , which looks simpler than the model ( [ h1 ] ) . in this respect",
    "an accurate study of the model ( [ hising ] ) is of a particular interest .",
    "we note that the magnetization curve in fig.([fig_3 ] ) resembles ( apart from the magnetization jump ) that observed in @xmath1 .",
    "this resemblance allows us to provide a qualitative explanation of the peculiarity of the magnetization process in this compound .",
    "the experimental curve is characterized by a sharp change of the susceptibility at the magnetic field @xmath194 tesla .",
    "we assume that this peculiarity in the magnetization behavior is related to the crossover between the incommensurate and the commensurate states ."
