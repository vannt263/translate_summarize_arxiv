    "providing quality of service ( qos ) guarantees in the form of limitations on the queueing delays or buffer violation probabilities is essential in many delay - sensitive wireless systems , e.g. , voice over ip ( voip ) , and wireless interactive and streaming video applications . due to the importance of such qos considerations , it is of significant interest to conduct an analysis and provide predictions for the performance levels of practical systems . in @xcite , effective capacity is proposed as a metric that can be employed to measure the performance in the presence of statistical qos limitations .",
    "effective capacity formulation uses the large deviations theory and incorporates the statistical qos constraints by capturing the rate of decay of the buffer occupancy probability for large queue lengths .",
    "hence , effective capacity can be regarded as the maximum throughput of a system operating under limitations on the buffer violation probability .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in the analysis of the effective capacity of fading channels ( see e.g. , @xcite ",
    "@xcite ) in order to identify the performance of wireless systems operating under statistical queueing constraints .",
    "however , in almost all prior studies , the service rates of the queueing model ( or equivalently the instantaneous transmission rates over the wireless channel ) are assumed to be equal to the instantaneous capacity values although channel coding is performed using a finite block of symbols .",
    "moreover , transmissions are assumed to be reliable with no decoding errors .",
    "however , it is important to note that error - free communication at the rate of channel capacity is generally attained as the codeword length increases without bound .",
    "therefore , when finite blocklength codes are employed , transmission is necessarily performed in the presence of decoding errors and possibly at rates less than the channel capacity in order to have high reliability or equivalently low error probability .    in @xcite and @xcite , negi and goel addressed these considerations .",
    "they studied queueing and coding jointly and took explicitly into account decoding errors by considering the random coding exponents of error probabilities for rates less than the instantaneous channel capacity .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , they analyzed the maximization of the joint exponent of the decoding error and delay violation probability through the appropriate choice of the transmission rate for given delay bound and constant arrival rate .    in this paper , we also depart from the idealistic assumptions of communicating arbitrarily reliably at channel capacity but follow an approach different from that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider channel coding rates achievable with finite blocklength codes , and incorporate the decoding error probabilities and possible retransmission scenarios into the effective capacity formulation .",
    "this analysis is facilitated mainly by the recent results of polyanskiy , poor , and verd in @xcite where the authors identified an approximate maximal achievable rate expression for a given error probability in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "this expression can be regarded as a second - order asymptotic approximation of the channel coding rate at large but finite blocklength values .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite also studied channel coding and achievable error probabilities at finite blocklengths by analyzing the mutual information density and its statistics . in @xcite , an outage analysis",
    "is performed by using the distribution of the mutual information density . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar outage formulation is used to determine the optimal physical - layer reliability and to identify the maximum arq throughput . on the other hand ,",
    "neither of the above - mentioned papers have investigated the throughput in the finite blocklength regime when the systems operate under buffer constraints .",
    "our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "we first determine the effective throughput in the finite blocklength regime under constraints on the buffer violation probability .",
    "subsequently , we study the performance of different transmission strategies .",
    "initially , we consider a scenario in which the transmission rate is varied with the fading realizations while the error probability is kept fixed . the optimal error probability that maximizes the throughput",
    "is shown to be unique .",
    "we analyze the impact of the power adaptations .",
    "then , we investigate the case in which transmission rate is fixed and error probability varies over different transmission blocks . through numerical results , we analyze the interactions between the throughput , queueing constraints , error probabilities , blocklength , signal - to - noise ratio , and different transmission strategies .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : channelmodel ] describes the fading channel model . in section [ sec : effcap - background ] , we provide preliminaries on the effective capacity as a measure of the throughput under statistical qos constraints .",
    "in section [ sec : effcap ] , we provide our results on the effective throughput in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] . several proofs",
    "are relegated to the appendix .",
    "we consider a frequency - flat channel model , and assume that the fading coefficients stay fixed for a block of @xmath0 symbols and then change independently for the following block . under this block - fading assumption ,",
    "the channel input - output relation in one coherence block can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the @xmath0-dimensional , complex , channel input and output vectors , respectively .",
    "the input is subject to an average power constraint , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the complex - valued fading coefficient with finite second moment , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that both the receiver and transmitter have perfect channel side information ( csi ) and hence perfectly know the instantaneous realizations of the fading coefficients . however , the assumption of perfect csi at the transmitter is relaxed in section [ subsec : fixed - rate ] .",
    "finally , @xmath7 represents the gaussian noise vector whose components are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) , complex , circularly symmetric , gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11 identity matrix .",
    "in @xcite , wu and negi defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a statistical qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath12 .",
    "if we define @xmath13 as the stationary queue length , then @xmath12 is the decay rate of the tail of the distribution of the queue length @xmath13 : @xmath14 therefore , for large @xmath15 , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability : @xmath16 hence , while larger @xmath12 corresponds to more strict qos constraints , smaller @xmath12 implies looser qos guarantees .",
    "similarly , if @xmath17 denotes the steady - state delay experienced in the buffer , then @xmath18 for large @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is determined by the arrival and service processes @xcite .",
    "therefore , effective capacity formulation provides the maximum constant arrival rates that can be supported by the time - varying wireless channel under the queue length constraint @xmath21 for large @xmath22 or the delay constraint @xmath23 for large @xmath19 .",
    "since the average arrival rate is equal to the average departure rate when the queue is in steady - state @xcite , effective capacity can also be seen as the maximum throughput in the presence of such constraints .",
    "the effective capacity is given by ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath24}\\}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 = \\sum_{i=1}^{t}r_i$ ] is the time - accumulated service process and @xmath26 denotes the discrete - time stationary and ergodic stochastic service process .",
    "we would like to note that in the remainder of the paper , we will refer to @xmath27 as the effective rate rather than the effective capacity since @xmath27 in our setup is the throughput when the service rates are equal to the approximate channel coding rates in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "in @xcite , the authors have studied the channel coding rate in the finite blocklength regime . for general classes of channels ,",
    "they have obtained new achievability and converse bounds on the coding rate for a given finite blocklength and error probability . in particular , for the real , additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , the transmission rate ( in bits per @xmath0 channel uses ) with error probability @xmath28 , signal - to - noise ratio ( ) , and coding blocklength @xmath0 is shown to have the following asymptotic expression ( * ? ? ? * theorem 54 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gaussian @xmath13-function . denoting the rate in bits per channel use by @xmath31",
    ", we can write @xmath32 where the approximation is accurate for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "note that the above results are for the awgn channel with real input and real output .",
    "in this paper , we consider a fading gaussian channel model with complex - valued input and output , and assume that channel coding is performed in each coherence interval of @xmath0 symbols , during which the fading stays fixed . under these assumptions , coding over a fading gaussian channel",
    "can be seen as coding over a real gaussian channel ( with a certain channel gain ) using a coding blocklength of @xmath33 .",
    "the following arguments provide a detailed description of this approach . knowing the channel fading coefficient @xmath5",
    ", the receiver can multiply the received signal with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the phase of @xmath5 , and obtain just rotates the output , is a reversible operation , and hence does not lead to any loss of information . ]",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 denote the real and imaginary components , respectively , of the output vector @xmath43 , input vector @xmath2 , and noise vector @xmath44 .",
    "it can be easily verified that @xmath45 has the same statistics as @xmath7 and hence @xmath46 .",
    "now , the above channel input - output relation can also be written as @xmath47= |h| \\ , [ { \\mathbf{x}}_r \\,\\ , { \\mathbf{x}}_i ] + [ \\tilde{{\\mathbf{n}}}_r \\,\\ , \\tilde{{\\mathbf{n}}}_i]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 $ ] denotes the vector formed by concatenating @xmath37 and @xmath40 .",
    "since the real and imaginary components are @xmath0-dimensional vectors , the above channel model is a real gaussian channel with @xmath33 dimensional input and output and with channel gain @xmath49 .",
    "note that the real and imaginary noise components @xmath39 and @xmath42 are independent due to the assumption of the circular symmetry of the additive complex gaussian noise .",
    "for this channel , the coding rate ( in bits per @xmath0 channel uses ) in the @xmath50 block achieved with block error probability @xmath51 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the fading coefficient in the @xmath50 block .",

    "now , the normalized rate in bits per channel use is approximately @xmath56 for large enough @xmath0 for which @xmath57 is negligible .",
    "henceforth , we assume that the instantaneous transmission rate in each coherence block of the fading channel is given by the expression in ( [ eq : codingratef ] ) .",
    "since the block error rate is @xmath51 , this rate is attained with probability @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that the receiver reliably detects the errors , employs a simple arq mechanism and sends a negative acknowledgement requesting the retransmission of the message in case of an erroneous reception .",
    "therefore , the data rate is effectively zero when error occurs . under this assumption ,",

    "[ fig : r_e - theta ] where we plot the maximum effective rate values ( i.e. , effective rate at the optimal error probability @xmath70 ) as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "another interesting analysis is the behavior of @xmath70 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps - theta ] . here , we observe that as @xmath12 increases and therefore the qos limitations become more stringent , the value of @xmath70 initially decreases sharply .",
    "hence , the transmitter opts for more reliable but low - rate transmissions . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath12 increases beyond approximately 0.028 , the trend reverses and @xmath70 starts to increase .",
    "the transmitter increases the transmission rate at the cost of increased @xmath70 and hence more retransmissions .",
    "when @xmath12 exceeds 0.298 , @xmath70 starts decreasing again .",
    "note that for high values of @xmath12 , the effective rate is small .",
    "this small effective rate can be supported by low - rate transmissions .",
    "hence , when @xmath12 is high beyond a threshold , the transmitter chooses to transmit at low rates and keep the error probability and the number of retransmissions low as well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_e - n ] , we plot the effective rate as a function of the blocklength @xmath0 for @xmath71 and @xmath86 .",
    "the solid - lined curves correspond to the effective rate in ( [ eq : effthr ] ) optimized over @xmath51 .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to the effective rate of the ideal model in which the service rate is equal to the instantaneous capacity , i.e. , @xmath87 and the error probability is assumed to be zero , i.e. , @xmath88 . here",
    ", we have interesting observations .",
    "when @xmath71 and the ideal model is considered , then the effective rate is @xmath89 , which is the ergodic capacity of the fading channel and is clearly independent of the blocklength . on the other hand , if the service rate is given by @xmath31 in ( [ eq : codingratef ] ) , the effective rate @xmath90 increases with blocklength @xmath0 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_e - n ] . in the presence of qos constraints , i.e. , when @xmath67 , we have stark differences . under the idealistic assumption of transmitting at the instantaneous capacity with no errors , we see from the behavior of the dashed curve for @xmath86 that effective rate decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that since @xmath0 is the coherence duration over which the fading state remains fixed , larger @xmath0 corresponds to slower fading and slow fading is detrimental for buffer - constrained systems . in a slow - fading scenario , deep - fading can be persistent causing long durations of low rate transmissions leading to buffer overflows . in the finite blocklength regime , as seen in the behavior of the solid - lined curve of the case of @xmath86 , there is a certain tradeoff . initially , increasing @xmath0 improves the performance as this allows the system to perform transmissions with longer codewords and to have higher transmission rates .",
    "however , if @xmath0 increases beyond a threshold , slowness of the fading starts to degrade the performance .    in all cases in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_e - n ] , the gap between the dashed and solid - lined curves diminishes as @xmath0 increases since the idealistic model becomes more accurate . on the other hand , for moderate values of @xmath0 ( e.g. , when @xmath91 ) , the idealistic assumptions lead to significant overestimations of the performance .",
    "finally , we provide numerical results for the optimal effective rate and optimal error probability as a function of @xmath54 in figs .",
    "[ fig : r_e - snr ] and [ fig : eps - snr ] , respectively , for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we see that , for fixed @xmath12 , increasing the @xmath54 improves the throughput and also the reliability of the transmissions by lowering the error probabilities .",
    "heretofore , we have considered the scenario where the transmitter knows the fading coefficients @xmath94 and performs variable - rate transmission with the same average power @xmath95 in each coherence block of @xmath0 channel uses . in this section , we investigate the gains achieved by varying the transmission power as well with respect to fading .",
    "let us denote the power adaptation normalized by the noise power by @xmath96 . with this adaptation policy ,",
    "the transmission rate is @xmath97 which is obtained by replacing @xmath54 with @xmath96 in ( [ eq : codingratef ] ) .",
    "finding the optimal power adaptation policy that maximizes @xmath31 or the effective rate @xmath98 is in general a difficult task due to the facts that both the first and second terms on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : codingratef - pa ] ) are concave functions .",
    "hence , @xmath31 is neither concave or convex . for this reason",
    ", we resort to suboptimal strategies .",
    "one viable policy , @xmath99 , is the one that maximizes the effective rate when the service process is assumed to be equal to the instantaneous capacity @xmath100 with zero error probability , i.e. , @xmath101 @xmath99 is derived in @xcite and is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 is chosen such that the average long - term signal - to - noise ratio constraint , + @xmath105 is satisfied with equality .",

    "the analysis above has assumed that the transmitter has perfect knowledge of the fading coefficients and can perform variable - rate and/or variable - power transmissions in each coherence block . on the other hand , it is practically interesting to consider cases in which the transmitter does not know the channel and send the information at a fixed rate . additionally , the transmitter may prefer fixed - rate transmissions , even when it knows the channel , due to complexities in varying the transmission rate for each block . motivated by these considerations , we assume in this section that the transmitter sends the information at the fixed rate @xmath107 . under this assumption ,",
    "error probability @xmath51 varies with the fading realizations .",
    "the analysis in the previous sections have , on the other hand , considered the scenarios in which the error probability is fixed for all channel states .",
    "from ( [ eq : codingratef ] ) , which provides the fundamental tradeoff between the rate and error probability in the finite blocklength regime , we can easily see that the error probability for fixed @xmath107 is @xmath108 note that @xmath51 is a function of the fading magnitude @xmath49 , signal - to - noise ratio @xmath54 , and blocklength @xmath0 .",

    "the effective rate becomes @xmath130 which can immediately be seen to be smaller than the effective rate in ( [ eq : r_e(0 ) ] ) .",

    "in which the transmission rate is varied and the error probability is kept fixed across different fading realizations , we have shown that the effective rate is maximized at a unique error probability .",
