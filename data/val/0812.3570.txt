    "the non - perturbative low energy behavior of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is well described by a series of effective models @xcite in both zero and finite temperature and densities @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that these models could result from the suppression of the high energy degrees of freedom of qcd ( such as gluons ) , and a scale that defines the validity of the model has to be introduced . in some of these models ,",
    "the quarks remain as the only degrees of freedom and , as these chiral quark models are usually non - renormalizable , in contrast with qcd itself and with mesonic models , these scales ( or cut - off ) are kept finite throughout the calculations . as a consequence , a series of problems @xcite emerge as a reflex of this process .",
    "nevertheless , the light hadrons phenomenology is successfully described by almost all these models , that , together with the non perturbative nature of qcd at this scale , justifies their employment .",
    "some of the results that are jeopardized by the introduction of a cut - off scale are the anomaly dependent results .",
    "in particular , the anomalous transition form factor @xmath0 , for the process @xmath1 , can only be correctly reproduced in the limit @xmath2 when no regulator is introduced @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a finite regularization is necessary to keep the models finite , and it is also necessary to reproduce the expected qcd factoration at large momenta , @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the pion weak decay constant .",
    "perturbativelly , the anomaly appears as an ambiguity , represented by surface terms , due to the infinities of the perturbative calculations .",
    "regularization of the feynman integrals fixes , _ a priori _ , the result of the computation of these surface terms , but the undetermined nature of the ambiguity appears as different results for different regularizations .",
    "if the undeterminacy of these terms is kept up to the end of the calculation , as occurs in some recent regularization schemes @xcite , it can be shown that the simultaneous transversality for massless fermions in the axial and vector channels is broken @xcite .",
    "on one hand , it is possible to fix the ambiguity in order to ensure the conservation of the electromagnetic ward - takahashi identity ( violating the chiral ward - takahashi identity ) , as required in qcd in order to explain the anomalous decays . on the other hand , it is also possible to fix the ambiguity in order to satisfy the chiral ward - takahashi identity and to violate the electromagnetic one , as in thoofts proton decay calculation @xcite .",
    "this undetermined character of the anomaly @xcite and the implications of the presence of ambiguous terms in quantum field theory calculations are in the heart of some recent controversies in the study of lorentz and cpt violations in qed @xcite .",
    "the picture in chiral quark models is somewhat different .",
    "their divergent non - renormalizable character implies in a dependence with an specific regularization scheme , which , _ a priori _ , fixes the ambiguous integrals .",
    "so , one can not expect , in these models , the undetermined character of the anomaly to manifest itself .",
    "the regularization schemes employed usually fix the vector gauge symmetry , and the transversality of the vector currents is guaranteed from the very beginning , reproducing for this reason the expected final result .    a recent chiral quark model , namely , the spectral quark model ( sqm ) @xcite , has some interesting features that can be explored to study the presence of the undetermined character of the anomaly , as well as to correct some of the fails on chiral quark models . for example , it was shown @xcite that the sqm solves the conflict between the anomaly normalization condition , @xmath5 , and the factorization at large momenta @xmath3 .",
    "the spectral quark model is based on the lehmann representation for the quark propagator @xcite , and in the solutions for the chiral and electromagnetic ward - takahashi identities using the gauge technique @xcite , resulting in a finite quark model .",
    "being finite , one can speculate ( i ) if the model correctly reproduces the anomalous results , ( ii ) if the freedom on the choice of the ward - takahashi identity to be violated by the anomaly is still present , as discussed above , and under which conditions one can obtain the expected violation of the chiral ward - takahashi identity and conservation of the electromagnetic ones in qcd .",
    "question ( i ) is already positively answered in ref .",
    "an important ingredient to this answer is the spectral version of the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite , a fact that we will stress later . in this paper , we intend to explore the answers to question ( ii ) .",
    "as we shall see , the specific form of the axial vector coupling plays an important role in this issue .",
    "non - local axial vector vertex for constituent quarks allows the presence of an axial vector coupling constant @xmath6 , and leading order @xmath7 effects can result in @xmath8 @xcite , even in the large @xmath7 limit .",
    "in contrast with the pseudo - scalar pion quark coupling constant @xmath9 , which vanishes in the chiral limit @xcite , one should not expect the axial coupling constant to vanish at this limit - model estimatives to @xmath6 lie in the range @xmath10 @xcite , a result that is compatible with the axial vector coupling constant of the nucleon , @xmath11 , deduced from neutral beta decay measurements @xcite and from the non - relativistic relation @xmath12 . in the context of the sqm , a dependence of @xmath6 with positive powers of the spectral mass @xmath13 , as occurs for the pion quark coupling constant via the goldberger - treiman relation , would be desirable , since positive momenta of the spectral distribution @xmath14 guarantees the finiteness of the amplitudes .",
    "we will show that a spectral @xmath15 with these characteristics is compatible with a non - vanishing axial coupling in the chiral limit .    in this paper",
    ", we : ( i ) discuss the role of the spectral version of the goldberger - treiman relation in the pseudoscalar two point function , showing its importance to the finiteness of this amplitude and to the obtaining of the nambu - goldstone mode ; ( ii ) obtain a more general expression for the axial vector vertex in the context of the spectral quark model , which includes the possibility of a non unitary axial coupling and ( iii ) by applying the gauge technique , obtain the probability amplitude for the axial - vector - vector process in the sqm , including non unitary axial coupling , and show that a dependence on the spectral mass for the axial coupling can generate an ambiguity free result , preserving the vector ward identity and violating the axial one , as expected for qcd .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly review the spectral quark model and some of its consequences . in section iii , we analyze the role of the goldberger and treiman relation in the finiteness of the pseudoscalar two point function . in section",
    "iv we present the construction of a general form of the axial vertex in the sqm compatible with a non vanishing axial coupling in the chiral limit . in section",
    "v , we compute the axial - vector - vector amplitude by employing the axial vertex obtained in section iv .",
    "we discuss the violation of the chiral ward - takahashi identity , and the role of the axial vertex on this result . finally , in section vi we present the conclusions .",
    "the spectral quark model is based on the introduction of the generalized lehmann representation for the quark propagator @xmath16 where @xmath13 is the spectral mass of the quark and @xmath14 is the spectral distribution , that acts as a regulator .",
    "the @xmath13 integral is supposed to be valuated in a suitable complex contour @xmath17 ( suppressed in our notation , from now on ) .",
    "the spectral function @xmath14 needs not to be completely determined , although it is possible to find an explicit form to it if the vector - meson dominance of the pion form factor is assumed @xcite . for the reproduction of most of the light mesons phenomenology ,",
    "it is sufficient to know some of the moments of the quark spectral function , determined via physical conditions such as normalization of the quark propagator , which implies in @xmath18 and finiteness of hadronic observables , implying in @xmath19 for @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "physical observables are proportional to the negative moments @xmath22 or to the logarithmic moments @xmath23    finiteness is guaranteed by the vanishing of the positive moments , eq .",
    "( [ positivemoments ] ) . as a consequence , negative and",
    "log moments can be fixed from the finite values of hadronic observables such as the quark condensate for one flavor @xmath24 the vacuum energy density @xmath25 and so on .",
    "the quark propagator ( [ sp ] ) can be parameterized as @xmath26 with the mass function given by @xmath27 and the wave function renormalization by @xmath28 in what follows , we will refer to the mass function at @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "the results presented here will not depend explicitly on @xmath31 , but it will be necessary in order to make contact with the standard representation of the partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) .",
    "the detailed determination of the spectral function moments , as well as the development of the sqm to the low - energy hadron phenomenology is presented in @xcite , and is not the aim of the present contribution .    to proceed with the computation of n - point functions in the sqm , the vertex functions are defined as particular solutions of the relevant ward - takahashi identities for unamputed green functions , obtained by applying the gauge technique @xcite .",
    "this allows the obtaining of linear solutions , whereas the use of amputed green functions would imply in the appearance of non - linear solutions to the ward - takahashi identities . the vector ward - takahashi identity ( vwi ) , for the vector - quark - quark vertex @xmath32 , reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is given by eq.([sp ] ) and @xmath35 are the pauli matrices ( we are assuming a su(2 ) flavor symmetry ) . a solution to eq .",
    "( [ wiv ] ) , up to transverse pieces , is @xmath36    the axial vector ward identity ( awi ) reads : @xmath37 and one possible solution to eq.([wia ] ) for the axial vector to quarks coupling is @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "one can identify the pion pole in ( [ axialvertex1 ] ) , the dominant term as @xmath40 . for massless quarks , it can not be done with a non spectral propagator , since in this case we have @xmath41 , and the consequent vanishing of the pole term .",
    "the pion to quarks coupling can be obtained from the axial vector vertex near the pion pole by using @xmath42 resulting in @xmath43    an important consequence of the appearance of the pion pole in solution ( [ axialvertex1 ] ) is the obtaining of the spectral version of the goldberger - treiman relation @xmath44 . by closing the quark line in the pion vertex , eq.([pionvertex ] ) , we can obtain the pseudoscalar two - point function @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for @xmath47 . due to the spectral conditions , eq.([positivemoments ] ) , the divergent terms arising from the computation of eq.([pips ] ) vanishes , and the final result is finite . in the intermediary calculation , however , an auxiliary regularization scheme is necessary in order to compute the loop momentum integral before the evaluation of the integral over the spectral mass @xmath13 .",
    "the use of a gauge invariant regularization scheme would enforce the _ a priori _ preservation of the gauge ward - takahashi identities .",
    "it is interesting , however , to explore how the correct violation of the awi in qcd can be obtained in a regularization independent way .",
    "we thus choose to work with the sharp - cutoff regularization scheme , a scheme that violates the vwi , as is widely known .",
    "in fact , employing the covariant sharp cutoff regularization scheme to compute the @xmath48 integral in ( [ pips ] ) , one obtains @xmath49 from the first term on the right hand side of eq.([pipscut ] ) one can clearly see that the goldberger - treiman relation is important in order to make the psedoscalar two - point function finite .",
    "if the coupling between the pion and the quarks was not dependent on @xmath13 , this term would be divergent in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "after applying the spectral conditions ( [ positivemoments ] ) on eq.([pipscut ] ) , we get @xmath51    from now on , all momentum integrals will be computed employing the covariant sharp cutoff regularization scheme . the use of this regularization to compute the pseudoscalar two point function introduces surface terms that could , in principle , break the nambu - goldstone mode @xcite .",
    "it also generates dependence on the arbitrary choice of the momentum routing in the loop . in a renormalizable theory",
    "it will be no problem : regularization and symmetries fix these ambiguities @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for purely fermionic chiral quark models .",
    "it is interesting , however , to observe how the spectral regularization corrects this fail : the surface terms that emerges from this computation are @xmath52 the details on the computation of surface terms will be presented on section v , in the context of the chiral anomaly .",
    "as we can see , the spectral condition ( [ positivemoments ] ) guarantees that eq.([surfacepips ] ) vanishes , since it depends on @xmath53 .",
    "the role played by the goldberger - treiman coupling @xmath54 becomes clear - if it was not present , then the pseudoscalar two point function , eq.([pips2 ] ) , would be divergent and dependent of the ambiguous result of the momentum integral in the left side of eq.([surfacepips ] ) .",
    "this feature - the dependence of the coupling with the spectral mass _ via _ the goldberger - treiman relation - suggests that a similar dependence on the spectral mass for the axial vector coupling could be important in the study of the chiral anomaly in the context of the spectral quark model .",
    "eq.([axialvertex1 ] ) is one of the possible solutions to the awi , eq.([wia ] ) .",
    "its functional form suggests that , for this ansatz , the axial coupling @xmath6 is unitary . as mentioned before , there are mechanisms that generate contributions to @xmath55 of order @xmath56 , such as the @xmath57 mixing mechanism @xcite , present in chiral models such as the @xmath58-model@xcite and the njl model @xcite . a general form to the axial vertex that allows @xmath59 , including pseudoscalar and pseudovector pion couplings is$ ] , not included in the present approach . ]",
    "@xmath60    where we introduced the spectral form factors @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "one can recognize that @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the ansatz ( [ axialvertex1 ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ wia ] ) with ( [ axialvertex2 ] ) gives @xmath67 and @xmath68    in what follows we will assume that the axial coupling depends on the spectral mass , but not on the exchanged momenta , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "one can recognize the poles associated to the goldstone pion in the second and third terms on the right hand side of eq.([axialvertex2 ] ) whereas the first term is associated to the axial vector coupling .",
    "let us denote this term as @xmath70 , with @xmath71    for on - shell massless quarks , dirac equation implies @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we get for the axial vector coupling with on - shell quarks @xmath73    eq.([acos ] ) gives us some insight about the functional form of @xmath15 : if it was proportional to any positive integer power of the spectral mass @xmath13 greater than @xmath74 the axial vector coupling for on - shell quarks would be zero . yet , assuming @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 an arbitrary constant , we obtain a non vanishing axial coupling in this limit . from our previous analysis of the pseudoscalar two - point function , a coupling constant proportional to an integer positive power of @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) would be desirable in order to render finite some amplitudes , and also to avoid regularization ambiguities . in the next section",
    "we will see that this feature is also necessary in the computation of the chiral anomaly in sqm , in order to make it free from ambiguities .",
    "the mechanism of the anomalous symmetry breakdown was co - discovered by bell and jackiw @xcite and adler @xcite .",
    "this violation is related to a probability amplitude that can not satisfy , simultaneously , the gauge and chiral symmetries .",
    "nevertheless , which symmetry is violated is a model dependent result : in the anomalous pion decay , the vwi are to be conserved and the awi is violated , whereas in the thooft calculation of the proton decay @xcite , the situation is opposite - the global gauge symmetry is violated and the chiral symmetry is preserved .        the probability amplitude for the axial - vector - vector process is represented by the triangle diagram , depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in order to compute it in the sqm",
    ", one needs to find a spectral representation to the vertex function with one axial and one vector current , @xmath80 , that fulfills the @xmath81 vector and axial vector ward identities .    for non - local axial vertex in the chiral limit",
    ", the axial ward identity reads : @xmath82    the first term on the right hand side of eq.([lavawi ] ) is the axial vertex computed with @xmath83 . this term express the fact that the contraction of the axial vertex with the exchanged momentum does not depends on @xmath6 , as can be easily checked by evaluating @xmath84 from eq .",
    "( [ axialvertex2 ] ) with the use of eqs.([ha ] ) and ( [ fa ] ) .",
    "the vector ward identity reads : @xmath85    a solution that fulfills eq.([lavvwi ] ) and eq.([lavawi ] ) in the chiral limit is given by : @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , replacing eq.([lav ] ) in eq.([lavawi ] ) one obtains : @xmath88    eq.([pcac ] ) displays the expected partial conservation of the axial current .",
    "this can be verified by evaluating the last term in eq.([pcac ] ) with @xmath89 , resulting in @xmath90 where we have made use of eq.([massfunction ] ) .",
    "so , the last term of eq.([pcac ] ) shows the violation of the axial current conservation arising from the fermionic mass term , as usual . when chiral symmetry is restored , eq.([termpcac ] )",
    "will vanish , and the axial ward identity , eq.([lavawi ] ) , will be fulfilled by the solution ( [ lav ] ) .    in the sqm",
    "the probability amplitude for the axial - vector - vector process is obtained by closing the quark line in the unamputated two currents ( axial and vector ) vertex , eq.([lav ] ) . with the appropriated insertion of the charge matrices , and the momenta labels chosen as in fig.([fig1 ] ) , this probability amplitude is given by : @xmath91 + \\text{crossed terms } , \\label{tavv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the quark charge matrix , @xmath93 and , for a @xmath81 model , @xmath94 is the pauli matrix @xmath95 . in order to compare with the pcac relation ,",
    "let us rewrite the term proportional to @xmath96 as @xmath97 where we have introduced the mass function at zero external momentum @xmath31 in order to associate @xmath98 with the standard representation of the neutral pion to two photons decay amplitude .",
    "eq.([tavv ] ) , of course , does not depend on @xmath31 , and can be rewritten as @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 we also have @xmath102    it is interesting to note that , after taking the dirac traces , eq.([tmunu ] ) is logarithmically divergent , and thus does not present surface terms in its computation .",
    "eq.([tstar ] ) is quadratically divergent , and in principle should present surface terms .",
    "however , in the sharp cutoff regularization scheme these surface terms result zero . after a little algebra ,",
    "we obtain @xmath103 and @xmath104    eq.([that ] ) , however , presents non - null surface terms in its calculation .",
    "these surface terms come from the difference of logarithmically divergent integrals , the same integrals in @xmath48 appearing in eq.([surfacepips ] ) , @xmath105 as already discussed , this term corresponds to a regularization ambiguity , since it can result zero in some regularizations ( e.g. gauge invariant pauli - villars ) or finite in other ones ( @xmath106 in the sharp cutoff regularization ) .",
    "so , introducing two feynman parameters on eq.([that ] ) we obtain @xmath107 with @xmath108 ( the sharp cut - off regularization scheme is , as before , implicitly assumed ) . in several regularization schemes , as in the sharp - cutoff , we are not allowed to shift the @xmath48 variable in eq.([feynpar ] ) , unless we introduce the corresponding surface term . following the procedure employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the surface term given by @xmath111    of course , as usual , @xmath112 is finite , so all integrals can be computed and the connection limit @xmath50 can be taken . after doing",
    "that , we have @xmath113 with @xmath114    from eqs .",
    "( [ tavv2 ] ) , ( [ that2 ] ) and ( [ tstar2 ] ) , the evaluation of the ward - takahashi identities in momentum space results in @xmath115 for the vwi , with a similar expression for @xmath116 , and @xmath117 for the awi .    before performing the spectral mass integrals , the result is potentially ambiguous due the presence of the surface term @xmath110 in eqs.([that2 ] ) , ( [ emwti ] ) and ( [ cwti ] ) . for a constant ( @xmath13 independent )",
    "@xmath6 , the surface term , eq.([surfterm ] ) , depends on the choice of the intermediary regularization employed in the evaluation of eq.([tavv ] ) , and it could generate different results in the ward identity to be violated by the anomaly , as it is well known .    nevertheless , from eq.([surfterm ] ) we can see that the computation of the axial - vector - vector amplitude in the sqm with the axial vertex given by eq.([axialvertex2 ] ) and with @xmath118 ( or @xmath119 ) is free from surface terms - the spectral condition , eq.([positivemoments ] ) , ensures their vanishing , as well as the vanishing of the other terms proportional to @xmath15 in eqs.([emwti ] ) and ( [ cwti ] ) . in this case , the vwi is always preserved ( i.e. , is preserved in an ambiguity free way ) and the awi is violated .",
    "hence , we clearly see that the choice of the specific dependence of the axial coupling with the spectral mass can result in an ambiguity free result , with the conservation of the vwi , and the violation of the chiral one , as expected for qcd . in this case",
    ", the vanishing of the spectral axial coupling in the zero spectral mass limit does not imply in the vanishing of the axial coupling itself .",
    "however , it is also possible to obtain the violation of the vwi , with conservation of the axial current , when the spectral axial coupling depends on the spectral mass with a power lower than 1 . in this case",
    ", the presence of ambiguous terms implies in the freedom on choosing which ward identity is to be violated .",
    "we have investigated the chiral anomaly in the context of the spectral quark model .",
    "we have proposed a generalized form of the four points vertex function with one axial and one vector current which includes the possibility of a non unitary , spectral mass dependent , axial coupling .",
    "this vertex function displays the expected partial conservation of the axial current , with the chiral ward identity being violated by a term proportional to the mass function which vanishes at the chiral limit .",
    "the triangle anomaly was computed , taking into account the surface term that appears in its calculation , and we have shown that a dependence of the axial coupling on integer positive powers of the spectral mass is necessary in order to render the triangle amplitude free from ambiguities . in this case , the vector ward identity is preserved , with the chiral ward identity being violated as expected for qcd .",
    "we also remarked that the dependence of the pion to quarks couplings on the spectral mass , via the goldberger - treiman relation for the pseudoscalar coupling , and via the ansatz employed here for the axial coupling , are essential to the obtaining of a result free from divergences and regularization ambiguities .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that , in the context of the spectral quark model , the chiral anomaly computation can be carried out reproducing the expected result without any ambiguity introduced by regularizations schemes , if the axial vertex is treated as a non - local spectral mass dependent vertex .",
    "this shows to be compatible with an non - unitary axial vector coupling , not vanishing at the chiral limit .",
    "our result suggests that the spectral quark model provides an useful mechanism to justify why in qcd the anomaly violates the chiral symmetry , instead of violating gauge symmetry , as in the case of the non conservation of the barionic number .",
    "however , we also discussed that the more general form for the axial vertex leaves room to the violation of the vector ward identity , complying the axial one",
    ". it could be interesting to analyze these features of the spectral quark model in the qcd chiral phase transition @xcite or in the construction of spectral approaches to some recent applications of the chiral anomaly @xcite .",
