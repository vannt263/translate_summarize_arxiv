    "recently , two sets of observations have allowed us to gain a better understanding of the interaction between agns and their host galaxies .",
    "these are observations of high  velocity wide  angle winds emanating from the vicinity of the smbh , which have been detected in a large fraction of agns ; and detection of kpc  scale quasi  spherical outflows in active galaxies , with enough power and mass flow to sweep their host galaxies clear of gas .",
    "these outflows have kinetic power equal to a few percent of the eddington luminosity of the central black hole and their momentum flow rate is approximately an order of magnitude greater than @xmath7 .    in this paper , we show how the two types of flows can be explained within the framework of agn wind feedback .",
    "radiation pressure from an accreting smbh expels gas in form of a wind from the nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which then pushes the ambient gas in the host galaxy and produces an outflow . in recent work",
    "@xcite we have shown that large  scale energy  driven flows ( see section [ sec : outflow ] ) can indeed drive much of the interstellar gas out of a galaxy bulge on a dynamical timescale @xmath8  yr , leaving it red and dead .",
    "the remaining mass of the bulge is then similar to the value set by the observed black  hole ",
    "mass relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observable features of such outflows  velocities , kinetic powers and mass and momentum flow rates  are consistent with observations .",
    "therefore agn outflows appear capable of sweeping galaxies clear of gas .",
    "radiation pressure from an agn accreting at close to its eddington limit can expel gas from the vicinity of the nucleus with a momentum rate @xmath9 as the wind on average has scattering optical depth @xmath10 and absorbs all of the radiation momentum .",
    "this creates a mildly relativistic diffuse wind ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the accretion radiative efficiency * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of blueshifted x  ray iron absorption lines corresponding to velocities @xmath14 reveal that the majority of quasars produce such winds .",
    "the winds have momentum and energy rates @xmath15",
    "it is clear that the wind has enough kinetic power to drive the observed large scale outflow , provided that it can efficiently transfer this power to the ism . in order for this to happen",
    ", two conditions must be satified .",
    "first , most of the sightlines from the smbh must be covered with diffuse medium .",
    "second , the wind can not cool efficiently . as the wind hits the ism , it shocks and heats to @xmath16",
    "k. at this temperature , the most efficient cooling process is inverse compton scattering of the photons in the agn radiation field @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this process drops with increasing shock radius , thus the cooling timescale increases as @xmath17 .",
    "since the outflow velocity does not depend strongly on radius @xcite , the flow timescale only increases as @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , there is a critical radius , @xmath19  kpc , within which the shock can be cooled efficiently , whereas outside most of its energy is retained and transferred to the outflow .",
    "the two cases are called momentum  driven and energy  driven flows , respectively ; their salient features are shown schematically in figure [ fig : outflow ] .",
    "an efficiently cooled shocked wind gas is compressed to high density and radiates away almost all of its original kinetic energy , retaining and communicating only its pressure , which is equal to the pre  shock ram pressure @xmath20 , to the host ism .",
    "for an isothermal ism density distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath21 and gas fraction @xmath22 ( the ratio of gas density to background potential density ) the behaviour of the flow depends on the black hole mass @xmath23 @xcite . for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the wind momentum is too weak to drive away",
    "the swept  up ism , and the flow stalls . for @xmath28",
    "the wind drives the swept  up ism far from the nucleus , quenching its own gas supply and further accretion .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 represents an approximate upper limit to the smbh mass distribution ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the calculated mass is very similar to that obtained from observations of the @xmath30 relation , despite having no free parameter .      a large  scale ( @xmath31  kpc ) outflow becomes energy driven .",
    "it is essentially adiabatic , and has the wind energy rate , i.e. @xmath32 ( from equation [ eq : pdotedot ] ) . the hot bubble s thermal expansion makes the driving into the host ism more vigorous than in the momentum  driven case .",
    "observed galaxy  wide molecular outflows must be energy  driven , as demonstrated directly by their kinetic energy content ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq : pdotedot ] ) .",
    "the adiabatic expansion of the shocked wind pushes the swept  up interstellar medium in a ` snowplow ' .",
    "in @xcite we derive the analytic solution for the expansion of the shocked wind in a galaxy bulge with an isothermal mass distribution . with agn luminosity @xmath33 ,",
    "all such solutions tend to an attractor @xmath34^{1/3 } \\simeq 925\\sigma_{200}^{2/3}(lf_{\\rm c}/f_{\\rm g})^{1/3}~{\\rm km\\ s}^{-1 } \\label{ve}\\ ] ] until the agn switches off when the shock is at some radius @xmath35 .",
    "subsequently , the expansion speed decays with @xmath36 as @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ ve ] ) , the current gas fraction @xmath38 may be lower than @xmath22 ( cf .",
    ". [ msig ] ) .",
    "the outflow persists for an order of magnitude longer than the duration of the quasar outburst that is driving it , and reaches radii of @xmath39  pc .",
    "it is evident that energy ",
    "driven outflows are capable of sweeping gas out of galaxies , quenching further star formation and establishing the smbh  bulge mass relationship @xcite .",
    "the solutions ( [ ve ] , [ dotr ] ) describe the motion of the contact discontinuity see figure [ fig : outflow ] ) .",
    "outflows are usually observed in molecular gas , which is embedded in the outflowing shell ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) , which moves with velocity @xmath40 from adiabatic shock conditions , using @xmath41 , and the mass outflow rate is @xmath42 assuming @xmath43 . if the agn luminosity is still close to eddington and @xmath44 , the mass loading factor ( @xmath45 ) and mass outflow rates are @xmath46 if the central quasar is no longer active , @xmath47 is lower by @xmath48 , with @xmath49 given by eq .",
    "( [ dotr ] ) .",
    "one can show from equations ( [ vout ] ) and ( [ eq : flmout ] ) that @xmath50 , i.e. most of the wind kinetic energy is transferred to the outflow , as expected for energy driving ( more precisely , while the quasar is active , the outflow contains @xmath51rds of the total energy ) .",
    "we can also derive an expression for the momentum flow rate @xmath52 in the outflow : @xmath53    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first two columns : observed mass flow rate ( in @xmath54  yr@xmath5 ) and velocity ( in km s@xmath5 ) of large  scale outflows in molecular ( mrk231 , iras 08572 + 3915 and iras 131205453 ) and warm ionised gas ( mrk1157 ) .",
    "middle three columns : quantities derived from observations .",
    "last three columns : mass flow rate , velocity and mass loading factor derived from our equations ( [ vout ] ) and ( [ eq : flmout ] ) . all derived quantities show good agreement with those observed and with each other .    references : @xmath55 - @xcite ; @xmath56 - ; @xmath57 - @xcite .    [ table : obs ]",
    "we see that in principle , large ",
    "scale wide  angle outflows driven by a mildly relativistic wind launched by the agn radiation pressure can sweep galaxies clear of gas .",
    "the observable properties of such outflows are typical velocities @xmath58  kms@xmath5 and mass flow rates up to @xmath59 ( equations ( [ vout ] ) and([eq : flmout ] ) ) .",
    "the outflows should have mechanical luminosities @xmath60 , but ( scalar ) momentum rates @xmath61 , consistent with observations ( see table [ table : obs ] ) .",
    "such outflows leave several observable signatures .",
    "cold gas clumps entrained within the shell produce the observed molecular emission .",
    "the inner wind shock accelerates cosmic ray particles , which can emit synchrotron radiation in the radio band and produce gamma rays when interacting with the ism .",
    "these signatures resemble those of the gamma  ray emitting bubbles in our galaxy recently discovered by _ fermi _",
