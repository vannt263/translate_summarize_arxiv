    "to calculate realistic models of chemically peculiar stars we have used a 1-d , lte , hydrostatic model atmosphere code llmodels ( shulyak .",
    "this code allows one to treat the line opacity without simplifying approximations and in this way accurately estimate how modification of the line opacity due to anomalous abundances , chemical stratification or the presence of strong magnetic field affects stellar atmospheres .",
    "our calculations cover the @xmath0 range between 6500 and 18000  k with a step of 250500  k and the @xmath1 range of 3.254.5  dex with a step of 0.25  dex . for @xmath2 models",
    "we have performed additional calculations for 5  kg magnetic field using the method described by kochukhov et al .",
