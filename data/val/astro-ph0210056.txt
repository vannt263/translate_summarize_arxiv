    "we have published kinematical observations of 20 des in @xcite .",
    "they were obtained at the carelec long - slit spectrograph attached to the 2-m telescope of the observatoire de haute - provence .",
    "figure 1 presents two typical velocity profiles : those of ngc 205 ( extending out to 5 arcmin ) , and ic 3328 , a virgo - cluster de .",
    "the kinematical profiles , extending beyond one effective radius , reveal significant rotation in all our candidate objects .",
    "a similar result is presented in @xcite .    from these and other sources ,",
    "we have selected 14 galaxies with reliable kinematical measurements .",
    "we did not include four of the faint virgo dwarfs observed by @xcite , where no rotation was detected , because the profiles extend to only a fraction of the effective radius ; experience from past observations reveals that extrapolations of central profiles is hazardous .",
    "for more than 10 years , de galaxies were though to be flattened by anisotropy @xcite .",
    "because new observations extend farther out , more rotation can be detected .",
    "since des feature roughly exponential photometric profiles , we can not apply directly the @xmath0 anisotropy test @xcite , which is adapted to the case of @xmath1 profiles .",
    "we thus developed a simple isotropic dynamical model as in @xcite , but for a @xmath2 profile @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath3 be the semi - major axis of an isophote ( with @xmath4 corresponding to the effective isophote ) , figure 2 presents typical normalized rotation curves for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the model shows that the maximum rotation is expected at @xmath7 for a de ( @xmath5 or 2 ) , compared to @xmath8 for an elliptical ( @xmath6 ) . and",
    "for a de , the expected @xmath9 ratio ( where @xmath10 is the peak central velocity dispersion ) is 10@xmath1120 % larger than for a normal e.        figure 3 shows the kinematic test for our data supplemented by other sources .",
    "most galaxies are compatible with being rotationally supported .",
    "the two flattest objects , ic 3393 and ic 3773 , bear large error bars but do not seem incompatible with isotropy .",
    "other interesting cases are ngc 205 and ic 794 . despite the significant rotation",
    "we have found , the former is unlikely to be isotropic ; and the latter is certainly anisotropic .",
    "several similarities do exist between e and de galaxies : a ) there is a continuum in the surface brightness _ versus _ luminosity diagram @xcite , b ) there is a transition in the shape of the photometric profile and , c ) on taking into account the difference in stellar populations @xcite , the de galaxies lie on the fundamental plane of ellipticals .",
    "these characteristics , however , reflect equilibrium relations and do not necessarily imply a common origin .",
    "conversely , the difference in clustering properties of the two classes is a clue for different origins .",
    "the new kinematical observations imply that the de progenitors are probably rotating dirr systems and low - mass , late - type spirals . as in the dekel et al .",
    "scenario , the intrinsic low - mass of the progenitors may result in an important mass loss due to the sn - driven winds , and this may explains their low metallicity .",
    "in addition , the ram pressure against the hot intergalactic medium strips off the residual neutral gas . dynamical harassment from encounters with massive galaxies , which predicts anisotropic objects @xcite , does not appear to represent a key factor for these des , but ram pressure stripping of the gas may have helped to stop the star formation .",
    "a few interesting objects deserve additional comments .",
    "ngc 205 may own its anisotropy to its interaction with m 31 @xcite .",
    "but we note that the relevance of the diagnostic may be questioned , since the observed kinematics fail to fit the isotropic model with a constant _",
    "m / l _ ratio .",
    "ic 794 is particularly interesting . as noted by pedraz et al . , it is strongly anisotropic , young , and metal rich .",
    "these characteristics make it a good candidate for being a tidal dwarf issued from enriched material after a major collision involving a spiral .",
    "we have no information on the stellar content of ic 3344 , the other anisotropic object of @xcite , which may be similar to ic 794 ( both lie in center of the virgo cluster ) .",
    "the other galaxies where @xcite did not detect rotation are fainter ; they may have been more sensitive to environment and predisposed to anisotropy . but",
    "observations extending to larger radii are needed to conclude ."
