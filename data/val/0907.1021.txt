    "the two pion channel offers the possibility of investigating various aspects of the meson resonance spectrum .",
    "it couples to the scalar - isoscalar channel that contains the @xmath15 , @xmath12 and possibly a few more resonances with masses below @xmath16 .",
    "it is the main decay mode of the lowest isoscalar - tensor @xmath13 resonance and it is the only decay mode of the isovector - vector resonance , the @xmath11 . among all these , the @xmath17-meson is by far the most prominent and most extensively studied , both from the point of view of its production mechanisms and its internal properties .",
    "nowadays the other resonances too are subjects of extensive theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "the @xmath15 meson is now established with pole mass and width determined with good accuracy  @xcite .",
    "however , its microscopic structure seems to be quite different from that of the @xmath17 and it is the subject of theoretical debate  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 is even a more enigmatic state : its experimental determination is complicated by its proximity to the @xmath18 threshold , and its qcd nature still awaits an explanation  @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath13 has been represented so far as a breit - wigner resonance  @xcite and appears to fit well into the quark model spectrum  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the scalar sector , using the @xmath17 meson as a benchmark for the analysis procedure .",
    "the @xmath18 channel from the same data set is currently being analyzed and in the near future a coupled - channels analysis will provide further constraints on the extraction of the meson properties .    for a long time",
    "most of our knowledge on the scalar meson spectrum was obtained from hadron - induced reactions , @xmath19 collisions and studying the decays of various mesons , e.g. @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath8 and @xmath22 .",
    "very few studies were attempted with electromagnetic probes , in particular real photons , since their production cross sections are relatively small compared to the dominant production of vector mesons .",
    "on one hand , through vector meson dominance , the photon can be effectively described as a virtual vector meson . on the other hand , quark - hadron duality and the point - like - nature of the photon coupling",
    "make it possible to describe photo - hadron interactions at the qcd level .",
    "recently , high - intensity and high - quality tagged - photon beams , as the one available at jlab , have opened a new window into this field .    in photoproduction processes ,",
    "information about the @xmath6-wave strength can be extracted by performing a partial wave analysis .",
    "angular distributions of photoproduced mesons and related observables , such as the moments of the angular distributions and the density matrix elements , are the most effective tools to look for interference patterns .",
    "an interference between the @xmath6-wave and the dominant @xmath7-wave was discovered in the moment analysis of @xmath23 photoproduction on hydrogen , analyzing the data collected in the experiments performed at desy  @xcite and daresbury  @xcite . in two - pion production experiments , such as",
    "reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , moments and density matrix elements were used to analyze the properties of helicity amplitudes describing the photoproduction process .",
    "unfortunately , only the dominant spin-1 partial wave of the @xmath24 pair was taken into account .",
    "no attempt to obtain information about the @xmath6-wave amplitude was made .",
    "more recently , the hermes experiment at desy  @xcite investigated the interference of the @xmath7-wave in the @xmath24 system with the @xmath6 and @xmath8-waves in the @xmath24 electroproduction process , and showed that such interference effects are measurable .",
    "the large photon virtuality @xmath253 gev@xmath2 is , however , a crucial factor that distinguishes this analysis from the photoproduction analysis  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models for @xmath24 photoproduction have been investigated in a series of articles .",
    "a very successful approach is the one by sding  @xcite and its numerous modifications  @xcite .",
    "these models were able to describe the shift of the maximum of the @xmath24 effective mass distribution with respect to the nominal @xmath17 mass and the asymmetric shape observed in slac  @xcite and desy  @xcite data .",
    "these properties are attributed to the interference of the dominating diffractive @xmath17 meson production , with its subsequent decay into @xmath24 , with the amplitudes corresponding to drell - type diagrams in which the photon dissociates into @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and one of the pions is elastically scattered off the proton .",
    "more recently , gmez tejedor and oset  @xcite applied an effective lagrangian to construct the photoproduction amplitudes .",
    "their approach is limited to photon energies below 800  mev and effective masses @xmath26 smaller than 1 gev .",
    "a two - stage approach for the @xmath24 @xmath6-wave photoproduction was proposed in the model of ref .",
    "first , a set of born amplitudes , corresponding to photoproduction of @xmath24 , @xmath27 , @xmath23 and @xmath28 pairs is calculated",
    ". then the photoproduced meson pairs are subject to final - state interactions resulting in the @xmath24 system  @xcite .",
    "the coupled - channels calculations were separately performed for all isospin @xmath29 components of the transition matrix .",
    "thus the @xmath6-wave amplitudes in that model account for the existence of the isoscalar @xmath15 , @xmath12 and @xmath30 , and the isovector @xmath31 and @xmath32 resonances .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath33 isovector channel with the @xmath34 amplitude is described in ref .",
    "all theoretical approaches described above do not consider explicitly the @xmath35-channel production of baryon resonances contributing to the @xmath36 final state .",
    "data from refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as from more recent experimental studies  @xcite , indicate that the contribution of baryon resonances , such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , dominate at lower incident photon energies ( below 2 gev ) .",
    "furthermore , data obtained with the saphir detector at elsa for photon energies between 0.5 gev and 2.6 gev show that the contribution of baryonic resonances to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 mass distributions gradually decreases with photon energy .",
    "in this paper we review the results of the analysis of @xmath24 photoproduction in the photon energy range 3.0 - 3.8 gev and momentum transfer squared @xmath41 between 0.4  gev@xmath2 and 1  gev@xmath2 , where the di - pion effective mass @xmath26 varies from 0.4 gev to 1.4 gev .",
    "the main results were previously reported in ref .",
    "we are not aware of any previous evidence of scalar mesons , in particular of the @xmath12 , in photoproduction of pion pairs .",
    "this effective mass region is dominated by the production of the @xmath11 resonance in the @xmath7-wave . from other experiments , such as pion - nucleon collisions @xmath42",
    "@xcite or nucleon - antinucleon annihilation  @xcite , there is some evidence that resonant states are formed in the @xmath6-wave .",
    "these resonances have been neglected in previous experimental analyses of @xmath24 photoproduction and , to our knowledge , the current analysis is the first one that explicitly takes into account the possibility that the @xmath6-wave is produced in the @xmath24 system .    in the following ,",
    "some details are given on the experiment and data analysis ( sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ) , on the extraction of the angular moments of the di - pion system ( sec .",

    "the measurement was performed using the clas detector  @xcite in hall b at jefferson lab with a bremsstrahlung photon beam produced by a continuous 60-na electron beam of energy @xmath43 = 4.02 gev impinging on a gold foil of thickness @xmath44 radiation lengths .",
    "a bremsstrahlung tagging system  @xcite with a photon energy resolution of 0.1@xmath45 @xmath43 was used to tag photons in the energy range from 1.6 gev to a maximum energy of 3.8 gev . in this analysis",
    "only the high - energy part of the photon spectrum , ranging from 3.0 to 3.8 gev , was used .",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 pairs produced by the interaction of the photon beam on a thin gold foil were used to continuously monitor the photon flux during the experiment .",
    "absolute normalization was obtained by comparing the @xmath46 @xmath47 pair rate with the photon flux measured by a total absorption lead - glass counter in dedicated low - intensity runs .",
    "the energy calibration of the hall - b tagger system was performed both by a direct measurement of the @xmath48 pairs produced by the incoming photons  @xcite and by applying an over - constrained kinematic fit to the reaction @xmath0 , where all particles in the final state were detected in clas  @xcite .",
    "the quality of the calibrations was checked by looking at the mass of known particles , as well as their dependence on other kinematic variables ( photon energy , detected particle momenta and angles ) .",
    "the target cell , a mylar cylinder 4 cm in diameter and 40-cm long , was filled by liquid hydrogen at 20.4 k. the luminosity was obtained as the product of the target density , target length and the incoming photon flux corrected for data - acquisition dead time .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty on the run luminosity was estimated to be in the range of 10@xmath45 , dominated by the uncertainties on the photon flux .",
    "outgoing hadrons were detected in the clas spectrometer .",
    "momentum information for charged particles was obtained via tracking through three regions of multi - wire drift chambers  @xcite within a toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath49 t ) generated by six superconducting coils .",
    "the polarity of the field was set to bend the positive particles away from the beam line into the acceptance of the detector .",
    "time - of - flight scintillators ( tof ) were used for charged hadron identification  @xcite .",
    "the interaction time between the incoming photon and the target was measured by the start counter ( st )  @xcite .",
    "this is made of 24 strips of 2.2-mm thick plastic scintillator surrounding the hydrogen cell with a single - ended pmt - based read - out .",
    "a time resolution of @xmath50300 ps was achieved .",
    "the clas momentum resolution , @xmath51 , ranges from 0.5 to 1% , depending on the kinematics .",
    "the detector geometrical acceptance for each positive particle in the relevant kinematic region is about 40% .",
    "it is somewhat less for low - energy negative hadrons , which can be lost at forward angles because their paths are bent toward the beam line and out of the acceptance by the toroidal field .",
    "coincidences between the photon tagger and the clas detector triggered the recording of the events .",
    "the trigger in clas required a coincidence between the tof and the st in at least two sectors , in order to select reactions with at least two charged particles in the final state .",
    "an integrated luminosity of 70 pb@xmath3 ( @xmath52 pb@xmath3 in the range 3.0@xmath533.8 gev ) was accumulated in 50 days of running in 2004 .",
    "the raw data were passed through the standard clas reconstruction software to determine the four - momenta of detected particles . in this phase of the analysis",
    ", corrections were applied to account for the energy loss of charged particles in the target and surrounding materials , misalignments of the drift chamber s positions , and uncertainties in the value of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the reaction @xmath0 was isolated detecting the proton and the @xmath4 in the clas spectrometer , while the @xmath5 was reconstructed from the four - momenta of the detected particles by using the missing - mass technique . in this way the exclusivity of the reaction is ensured ,",
    "keeping the contamination from the multi - pion background to a minimum .",
    "figure  [ fig : pid ] shows the @xmath5 missing mass squared .",
    "the background below the missing pion peak appears as a smooth contribution in the @xmath54 invariant mass without creating narrow structures .    to avoid edge regions in the detector acceptance , only events within a _ fiducial _",
    "volume were retained in this analysis . in the laboratory reference system , cuts were defined for the minimum hadron momentum ( @xmath55  gev and @xmath56  gev ) , and the minimum and maximum azimuthal angles ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "the _ fiducial _ cuts were defined comparing in detail the experimental data distributions with the results of the detector simulation .",
    "the minimum momentum cuts were tuned for different hadrons to take into account the energy loss by ionization of the particles .    after all cuts , 41 m events were identified as produced in the exclusive reaction @xmath0 .",
    "the other event topologies , with at least two hadrons in the final state ( @xmath59 , @xmath24 , @xmath60 ) , were not used since in the kinematics of interest for this analysis ( @xmath61  gev@xmath2 ) , the collected data are about one order of magnitude less due to the detector acceptance . figures  [ fig : dalitz ] and  [ fig : invmasses ] show the invariant mass spectra of the different combinations of particles in the final state .",
    "the @xmath11 dominates the @xmath54 spectrum and the @xmath62 peak is clearly visible in the @xmath63 invariant mass .",
    "figure 2 shows a small overlap between the @xmath62 and the @xmath54 spectrum .",
    "baryonic resonances in the @xmath59 invariant mass spectrum are less pronounced .",
    "it has to be noted that the projection of the baryon resonance peaks in the @xmath54 spectrum results in a smooth contribution and can not create narrow structures .",
    "the effect of this background was extensively studied as discussed in sec.[sec : sys ] .",
    "in this section we consider the analysis of moments of the di - pion angular distribution defined as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the differential cross section ( in momentum transfer @xmath66 and di - pion invariant mass @xmath26 ) , @xmath67 are spherical harmonic functions of degree @xmath68 and order @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the @xmath4 flight direction in the @xmath24 helicity rest frame . for the definition of the angles in the di - pion system we follow the convention of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : mom ] that , for a given @xmath71 and di - pion mass @xmath26 , @xmath72 corresponds to the di - pion production differential cross section @xmath73 .",
    "there are many advantages in defining and analyzing moments rather than proceeding via a direct partial wave fit of the angular distributions .",
    "moments can be expressed as bi - linear in terms of the partial waves and , depending on the particular combination of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , show specific sensitivity to a particular subset of them .",
    "in addition , they can be directly and unambiguously derived from the data , allowing for a quantitative comparison to the same observables calculated in specific theoretical models .",
    "extraction of moments requires that the measured angular distribution is corrected by the detector acceptance .",
    "we studied three methods for implementing acceptance corrections .",
    "in the first two methods , the moments were expanded in a model - independent way in a set of basis functions and , after weighting with monte carlo events , they were compared to the data by maximizing a likelihood function .",
    "the first of these two parametrizes the theory in terms of simplified @xmath76 , while the second uses directly @xmath77 as defined above .",
    "the approximations in these methods have to do with the choice of the basis and depend on the number of basis functions used .",
    "the systematic effect of such truncations was studied and the main results are reported below . in the last method",
    ", data and monte carlo were binned in all kinematical variables .",
    "the data were then corrected by the acceptance defined as the ratio of reconstructed over generated monte carlo events in that bin .",
    "since it was found to be not reliable in bins where the acceptance was small or vanishing , this method was only used as a check of the others and was not included in the final determination of the experimental moments .",
    "the clas detection efficiency for the reaction @xmath78 was obtained by means of detailed monte carlo studies , which included knowledge of the full detector geometry and a realistic response to traversing particles .",
    "events were generated according to three - particle phase space with a bremsstrahlung photon energy spectrum .",
    "a total of @xmath79 billion events were generated in the energy range 3.0 gev @xmath80 3.8 gev and covered the allowed kinematic range in @xmath41 and @xmath81 .",
    "about 700 m events were reconstructed in the @xmath81 and @xmath41 ranges of interest ( 0.4 gev @xmath82 1.4 gev , 0.1 gev@xmath83 1.0 gev@xmath2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to more than fifteen times the statistics collected in the experiment , thereby introducing a negligible statistical uncertainty with respect to the statistical uncertainty of the data .",
    "moments were derived from the data using detector efficiency - corrected fitting functions .",
    "as mentioned above , the expected theoretical yield was parametrized in terms of appropriate physics functions : production amplitudes in one case and moments of the cross section in the other .",
    "the theoretical expectation , after correction for acceptance , was compared to the experimental yield .",
    "parameters were extracted by maximizing a likelihood function defined as : @xmath84.\\ ] ] here @xmath85 represents a data event , @xmath86 is the number of data events in a given @xmath87 bin ( _ i.e. _ the fit is done independently in each bin ) , @xmath88 represents the set of kinematical variables of the @xmath89 event , @xmath90 is the corresponding acceptance derived by monte carlo simulations and @xmath91 is the theoretical function representing the expected event distribution .",
    "the measure @xmath92 includes the phase space factor and the likelihood function is normalized to the expected number of events in the bin @xmath93 the advantage of this approach lies in avoiding binning the data and the large uncertainties related to the corrections in regions of clas with vanishing efficiencies .",
    "comparison of the results of the two different parametrizations allows one to estimate the systematic uncertainty related to the procedure . in the following ,",
    "we describe the two approaches in more detail .",
    "the expected theoretical yield in each bin is described as : @xmath94 this parametrization has the benefit that the intensity function @xmath91 is by construction positive .",
    "however , it can lead to ambiguous results since it has more parameters than can be determined from the data .",
    "in addition , for practical reasons , the parametrization involves a cutoff , @xmath95 , in the maximum number of amplitudes . for a specific choice of @xmath95 ,",
    "the number of fit parameters is given by @xmath96 .",
    "we also note that these amplitudes are not the same as the partial wave amplitudes in the usual sense of a di - pion photoproduction amplitude , since the latter depends on the nucleon and photon spins .    after removing the irrelevant constants ,",
    "the fit is performed minimizing the function : @xmath97 where we have introduced the rescaled amplitudes @xmath98 defined by : @xmath99 and the acceptance matrix @xmath100 was computed using monte carlo events as : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the number of generated and reconstructed events , respectively .",
    "fits were done using minuit with the analytical expression for the gradient , and using the simplex procedure followed by migrad  @xcite .",
    "after each fit , the covariance matrix was checked and if it was not positive definite , the fit was restarted with random input parameters . at the end ,",
    "the uncertainties were computed from the full covariance matrix .      the expected theoretical yield in each @xmath87 bin is described as : @xmath104 the parametrization in terms of the moments directly gives the quantities we are interested in ( moments @xmath105 ) .",

    "the results are similar to what was obtained with the previous method , showing the same stability against @xmath95 truncation and a similar goodness of the fit . to check the sensitivity of the likelihood fit to the parameter initialization",

    "the three different methods gave consistent results and the difference of moments obtained using the different procedures was used to evaluate the systematic uncertainty related to the fit procedure .",
    "moments derived by the different procedures agreed qualitatively .",
    "the most stable results were obtained by using the first parametrization , although we do find occasionally large bin - to - bin fluctuations .",
    "however , there are no a priori reasons to prefer one of the two methods and we consider the discrepancies between the fit results as a good estimate of the systematic uncertainty associated with the moments extraction .",

    "more generally , by examining the experimental moments , we observe that the interference between the dominant @xmath7-wave , seen in the @xmath159 moment in the @xmath17 region , indicates that the @xmath160 and the @xmath161 amplitudes are out of phase . for a single nucleon - helicity amplitude",

    "this would also explain why the @xmath165 and @xmath163 moments have comparable magnitudes . to accommodate such behavior ,",
    "at least two nucleon - helicity amplitudes are required .",
    "in addition , since strong interactions conserve isospin , it is convenient to write the @xmath149 amplitudes in the isospin basis . each amplitude",
