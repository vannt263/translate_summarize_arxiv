    "this reduces the observed period variations ( the sun and other inactive stars ? ) .",

    "the periods @xmath12 and @xmath3 of these cabs are constant for long periods of time .",
    "the observed photometric periods of these stars appear to change , but this is probably caused by the interference of two constant period waves .",
    "does this then mean that there is no surface differential rotation in these cabs ?",
    "it has been known for a long time that surface differential rotation in these rapidly rotating stars is weak ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no one has ever seriously claimed that surface differential rotation is totally absent .",
    "surface differential rotation may be present in these cabs , but the locations of stationary s1 and s2 spots seem stable , as well the movement of the nonstationary spots s3 and s4 .",
    "could the driving mechanism of magnetic fields in these cabs be the rotation of plasma of free charged particles producing stationary and nonstationary magnetic field waves ?",
    "spots s1s4 are simply the signatures of these waves . and where there is a wave , and another wave , there are probably numerous waves .",
    "we have discovered only the two strongest waves in these cabs .",
    "could the interference of stationary and nonstationary waves sustain long - lived magnetic fields ? if these waves are stronger in rapidly rotating stars late type stars , their interference produces stronger spots .",
    "could interference explain the differences between the magnetic fields of early and late type stars ?",
    "in early type stars , their radiative envelopes allow the waves of the magnetic field to remain stable . in late type stars",
    ", convection complicates things .",
    "thus , quasiperiodic spot distribution changes are observed in late - type stars , and stable spot distributions in early type stars ? a more sophisticated version of our model could be a sum of spherical functions describing the stationary and nonstationary magnetic field waves .",
    "perhaps the free parameters of this model could be solved from observations .",
    "this brings us back to the two currently known alternatives for magnetic fields in all spectral types    * rotation and convection ( dynamo ) * fossil fields    we admittedly only speculate about a third alternative    * rotation and interference    `` rotation '' is present only in two of these three alternatives . or is `` rotation '' present in all three alternatives ?",
    "our expertise lies in time series analysis , not in the modelling stellar magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , this interference hypothesis of ours is tentative .",
    "here is our simple analogy .",
    "the orbital and rotation periods of the moon are equal . due to this synchronization , we never see the dark side of moon when it is illuminated by the sun .",
    "imagine that a giant large dark circular screen would begin to rotate around the moon with a period of for example ten years ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is what we see in cabs and single stars .",
    "the main differences are that the rotation period of earth is not synchronized with the orbital motion of the moon , and the `` spot '' on the moon is not stuck to its surface , but moves due to the illumination of the sun .",
    "we present a general model for the light curves of chromospherically active single and binary stars ( eq . [ solution ] ) . this model explains the connection between orbital motion , long - term starspot distribution changes , ellipticity and `` flip  flop ''  events in cabs .",
