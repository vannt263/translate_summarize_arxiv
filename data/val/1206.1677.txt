    "to obtain monte carlo ( mc ) estimates of thermal averages , one often has to run mc codes multiple times in order to get the corresponding results at different values of system parameters , such as temperature , volume , magnetic or electric fields , etc . , or at different values of interparticle interaction constants .",
    "to avoid these extra time - consuming runs , several highly effective strategies for sampling phase space of the system and/or extracting maximum relevant information from the mc data acquired have been suggested . among them , these are histogram methods by ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite , the multicanonical method by berg and neuhaus @xcite , the wang - landau method @xcite and others .",
    "thus , in the first method we record a histogram @xmath3 of how many times each particular value of the energy @xmath4 is generated in mc simulation at a particular temperature @xmath5 . then , using this energy distribution histogram one can in principle recalculate the corresponding energy distribution and thermal averages at an arbitrary temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the multicanonical method is based on the idea of using inverse of the density of states , @xmath7 , instead of the boltzmann factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , for sampling the energy states in the metastable - unstable region of the canonical ensemble .",
    "this results in a histogram in which all energies are sampled equally .",
    "the obvious problem with the direct implementation of this idea is that we do not know the density of states @xmath11 .",
    "however , using a sequence of approximations , berg and neuhaus were able to demonstrate that @xmath11 can be found , even in a particularly impressive case of a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the wang - landau algorithm allows to estimate the density of states @xmath11 directly instead of trying to estimate it from the probability distribution obtained at @xmath5 and then with density of states one can easily calculate the partition function , free energy , etc . at an arbitrary temperature @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the original wang - landau algorithm @xcite proposed for mc sampling in spin lattice systems has been generalized to the off - lattice systems , such as continuum ( fluid ) models @xcite , polymer films @xcite . by a suitable reformulation of the problem",
    "the wang - landau sampling scheme can be advantageously employed in quantum systems as well @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed that the applicability of these methods is severely restricted by the presence of statistical errors in the data , @xmath3 or @xmath11 , generated in mc sampling .",
    "if errors in the data become comparable or bigger than the true values in the energy range near the average potential energy at temperature @xmath6 , then the above methods fail to continue the corresponding thermal averages from @xmath12 to @xmath6 temperatures .    in statistical physics , quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , and many other fields of modern theoretical physics , where some kind of averaging of a generalized exponential function is present",
    ", we constantly face the so - called _ cumulant expansions _",
    "although _ cumulants _ ( _ semi - invariants _ ) have been known long before in mathematical statistics and probability theory , it was kubo who first convincingly demonstrated in his pioneering work @xcite how the concept of cumulants can be widely applied to various problems of quantum mechanics and statistical physics .",
    "for example , it has been successfully applied to ursell - mayer expansion for classical and quantum gases mm:40 that is usually obtained by much longer diagram considerations , to perturbation series in quantum mechanics and random perturbations in dynamical systems , to relaxation functions in irreversible processes ku:57,ku:62 , etc . in spite of such a diversity of applications discovered so far , cumulants and their properties",
    "have not been , to the best of our knowledge , exploited before in the context of analytic continuation problems both in classical and quantum domains . in his original paper , kubo greatly generalized the classical concept of cumulant expansion to the case of non - commuting operator generating algebra and applied relations found in this algebra to a diverse set of physical problems . in @xcite , a number of useful algebraic and geometric properties of cumulant expansions have been summarized and applied to generate cumulant faddeev - like equations and to establish a method of increments for excited states . very recently , cumulant expansion techniques have been successfully applied to the fourier path integrals @xcite however , application of cumulants to the problem of analytic continuation requires the knowledge of differential properties of cumulants .",
    "these properties have not been established before .",
    "therefore , one of the goals of the present paper is to derive those properties of cumulants that are of paramount importance for analytic continuation applications .    in this work",
    ", we present a new , more robust cumulant expansion method which allows to analytically continue thermal averages in the neighborhood of @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , we prove the key theorem [ t1 ] which relates the derivative of the @xmath14th order cumulant with respect to the inverse temperature @xmath15 to a @xmath16th order cumulant . based on this theorem , one can develop an asymptotic expansion in the neighborhood of @xmath5 in terms of higher order cumulants .",
    "also , some numerical results for the heat capacity of the lennard - jones ( lj ) clusters illustrating the cumulant s derivative theorem and the quality of the derived expansions are presented .",
    "one of the advantages of the proposed method is that the analytic continuation can be implemented directly without need of separate calculating @xmath3 or @xmath11 distributions .",
    "moreover , given the cumulants , if necessary one can easily express these distributions in terms of cumulants .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the energy representation for the phase - space probability density function ( pdf ) is introduced in section [ s2 ] . in the energy representation ,",
    "all degrees of freedom irrelevant to thermodynamic equilibrium are integrated out .",
    "next section considers how partition function , entropy , and statistical temperature can be expressed via kinetic and potential energy pdfs . the thermodynamic energy , heat capacity and its differential properties",
    "are given in terms of cumulant expansions in section [ s4 ] . here , the key theorem [ t1 ] about cumulant s derivative is formulated . in section [ s5 ] ,",

    "concluding remarks are in section [ cr ] .",
    "finally , technical details about cumulants , proofs of theorems [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] can be found in appendices [ app1]-[app3 ] .",
    "let us consider a classical system , the phase space of which is described by a set @xmath17 of @xmath18 canonically conjugate coordinate @xmath19 and@xmath20 momentum @xmath21 variables . on the phase space",
    "we define the pdf @xmath22 that fully describes a thermal equilibrium state such that the thermal average of an observable @xmath23 can be calculated as @xmath24where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an appropriate weight factor , sometimes called gibbs factor , which makes the classical averaging as close as possible to the quantum - mechanical one .",
    "further , we assume that the pdf depends on @xmath27 functions @xmath28 and @xmath27 control parameters @xmath29 so that its @xmath17-dependence can be represented as @xmath30 for the observable we assume a similar structure , @xmath31 to be valid .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) , we effectively integrated out all extra degrees of freedom not important in the equilibrium state .",
    "the problem that now can be formulated is how to calculate this energy pdf at a fixed set of parameters .",
    "the energy pdf at an arbitrary set of parameters @xmath0 can be calculated , at least in principle , if it is known at a fixed one , @xmath1 , as follows .",
    "usually , the pdf in the phase space is known up to the normalization factor or partition function .",

    "non - relativistic physics @xmath49 is , in principle , infinite due to possible infinite particle s momentum values .",

    "we wish to calculate the density of states@xmath64 in contrast to the partition function , the calculation of the density of states can not be factorized in separate integrals over momenta and coordinates . to overcome this difficulty",
