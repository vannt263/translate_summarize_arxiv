    "planets form and grow in circumstellar disks . before a planet s",
    "mass reaches to the mass of jupiter , its tidal force opens a gap in the circumstellar disk ( lin & papaloizou 1986 , kley & nelson 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "material that resides beyond the gap in the circumstellar disk can be accreted by the protoplanet , but forms a circumplanetary disk because of its large angular momentum ( lubow et al .",
    "1999 ; ayliffe & bate 2009 ) .",
    "the accretion of the circumplanetary disk determines the final mass of the giant planet . since circumstellar disks have lifetimes of a few million years ( hernandez et al .",
    "2007 ) , forming a 1@xmath1310 m@xmath1 planet within such time requires that the circumplanetary disk has an average accretion rate of @xmath14 .",
    "although there have been no clear detections of circumplanetary disks yet ( except for a possible candidate ,  5.3 ) , theoretical studies show the possibility of complex circumplanetary disk structures : the infall from circumstellar to circumplanetary disks can occur at high altitudes ( tanigawa et al .",
    "2012 , szulagyi et al .",
    "2014 ) , the infall can carry little angular momentum ( canup & ward 2002 ) , the infall can be episodic ( gressel et al .",
    "2013 ) , the surface of the disk can be subject to magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( fujii et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 , turner et al .",
    "2014 ) , a magnetocentrifugal wind can develop in the disk ( gressel et al .",
    "2013 ) , the disk midplane can be dominated by hall mhd ( keith & wardle 2014 ) , and the disk can undergo outbursts ( lubow & martin 2012 ) .",
    "future circumplanetary disk observations are needed to constrain their structure .",
    "fortunately , finding circumplanetary disks may not be too difficult .",
    "a disk around a 1 m@xmath1 planet accreting at @xmath15 has an accretion luminosity of @xmath16 which is as bright as a late m - type / early l - type brown dwarf ( basri 2000 ; chabrier & baraffe 2000 ) .",
    "finding these disks in future observations will enable us to test accreting disk theory , constrain satellite formation , and finally find young planets .    in this paper theoretical seds of accreting circumplanetary disks are calculated .",
    "these seds together with other accretion signatures can be used for planning future observations to discover such disks . in  2 , the radiative transfer model is introduced .",
    "the seds are shown in  3 .",
    "the observational signatures of magnetospheric accretion are presented in  4 .",
    "finally , after a short discussion in  5 , the paper is summarized in  6 .",
    "as a first attempt to calculate the seds of accreting circumplanetary disks , i only focus on disks whose accretion luminosity is stronger than the planet irradiation .",
    "this requirement significantly simplifies the sed calculation since the seds of these disks are independent of the planet properties . to be more specific",
    ", i only study accreting circumplanetary disks with @xmath17 around low mass planets , such as a 1 m@xmath1 planet .",
    "a 1 m@xmath1 planet has an effective temperature of @xmath3800 k at an age of 1 million years in the `` hot start '' planet model ( spiegel & burrows 2012 , sb ) , and it has a total luminosity of 4@xmath18 l@xmath19 .",
    "meanwhile , the luminosity of an accretion disk with @xmath17 is @xmath10 @xmath20l@xmath19 .",
    "thus , the irradiation from the planet to the disk can be ignored in the disk sed calculation . for slowly accreting circumplanetary disks ( e.g. @xmath21 ) around high mass planets with `` hot start '' ( e.g. a 10 m@xmath1 planet with an effective temperature of 2000 k ) ,",
    "a proper treatment including the planet irradiation is needed and left for future publications .",
    "this viscous heating dominated disk resembles fu orionis systems for protostars ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) .",
    "thus , i follow the method of zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ) and calvet et al .",
    "( 1991a , b ) ( which was used to calculate the seds of fu orionis systems ) to calculate the disk spectrum . in summary ,",
    "i calculate the emission from the atmosphere of a viscous , geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk with constant mass accretion rate @xmath22 around a planet with mass @xmath23 and radius @xmath24 .",
    "the disk height @xmath5 is assumed to vary with the distance from the planet as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is assumed , and @xmath27 is the disk inner radius .",
    "this approximation is not very accurate but it only affects the local surface gravity of the disk atmosphere , which has only a small effect on the emergent spectrum .",
    "we assume that radiative equilibrium holds in the disk atmosphere , and the surface flux is determined by the viscous energy generation in the deeper disk layers .",
    "this constant radiative flux through the disk atmosphere can be characterized by the effective temperature distribution of the steady optically - thick disk as in @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the central planet s mass .",
    "this equation predicts that the maximum disk temperature @xmath30 occurs at @xmath31 and then decreases to zero at @xmath32 . since this decrease of temperature towards the planet is sensitive to the boundary condition at the planet surface , equation ( [ eq : fv ] )",
    "is modified so that , when the radius is smaller than 1.36 @xmath27 , the temperature is constant and equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the vertical temperature structure at each radius is calculated using the gray - atmosphere approximation in the eddington limit , adopting the rosseland mean optical depth @xmath34 .",
    "the emission from either the boundary layer or the magnetospheric accretion shock has been neglected in this calculation .",
    "their contributions to the sed will be included in  4 . generally ,",
    "when the magnetosphere is equal or smaller than 2 r@xmath1 , such emission would emerge in uv / optical and irrelevant to modeling the infrared sed here , except that the accretion shock might enhance the heating to the disk via irradiation (  4 ) .",
    "the opacity of atomic and molecular lines has been calculated using the opacity distribution function ( odf ) method @xcite .",
    "the odf method is a statistical approach to handle line blanketing when millions of lines are present in a short wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the line list is taken from @xcite .",
    "not only atomic lines but also many molecular lines are included .",
    "the opacities of tio and h@xmath35o , the most important molecules in the infrared , are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the details on this method and opacity sources can be found in zhu et al .",
    "we improve the dust opacity in zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) by following dalessio et al .",
    "we assume that mgfesio@xmath36 ( olivine ) and mg@xmath37fe@xmath38sio@xmath39 ( pyroxene ) have dust - to - gas mass ratio of 0.0017 respectively , and graphite has mass ratio of 0.0041 .",
    "the grain size distribution has a power law of 3.5 with 0.005@xmath40 m and 1@xmath40 m as the minimum and maximum size .",
    "the dust sublimation temperatures for different dust species are taken from dalessio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . at low temperatures",
    "complex chemical processes occur which are not included in the kurucz data .",
    "low temperature molecular opacity has not been calculated in detail ; instead , the abundance ratio between different types of molecules below 700 k is assumed to be the same as the ratio at 700 k. this is unimportant for our purposes because dust opacity dominates at such low temperatures .",
    "the total flux from the accretion disk is the addition of the fluxes coming from all the annuli in the disk .",
    "the radii of these annuli are chosen to increase exponentially from @xmath32 to @xmath41 . since the size of the planet is uncertain , depending on the `` cold '' and `` hot start '' planet models ( marley et al .",
    "2007 , 1 - 2 r@xmath1 in sb ) , and the inner disk may be truncated by the planet s magnetosphere (  4 ) , @xmath27 is varied from 1 to 4 jupiter radii in our calculation .",
    "the outer radius @xmath41 is also very uncertain . theoretically , @xmath41 should be smaller than the maximum extent of the circumplanetary disk @xmath30.4 @xmath42 where @xmath42 is the hill radius of the planet ( martin & lubow 2011 ) . for a jupiter mass planet at 20",
    "au , this is around @xmath3 @xmath43 r@xmath44 . another rough constraint for @xmath41",
    "can be derived if we assume that the accretion in circumplanetary disks is due to mri .",
    "the disk needs to be sufficiently ionized to sustained mri and thermal collision can sufficiently ionize the disk up to 50 r@xmath44 ( keith & wardle 2014 ) when the disk accretes at 10@xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , if material from the circumstellar disk falls directly to the inner regions of the circumplanetary disk ( machida et al .",
    "2008 , machida 2009 , tanigawa et al .",
    "2012 ) , the accretion disk will also be small .",
    "however , while accreting , the circumplanetary disk will also expand to conserve angular momentum .",
    "eventually the tidal torque from the central star can remove the angular momentum of the circumplanetary disk when the disk extends to 0.4 @xmath42 ( martin & lubow 2011 ) . in this case , the disk temperature structure deviates from a standard viscous model and will be discussed in  5.1 .",
    "nevertheless , in the next section , we set @xmath41 to be 50 @xmath27 and 1000 @xmath27 respectively to demonstrate how insensitive the disks seds depend on @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : sed ]    the sed of a steady , optically - thick accretion disk is determined by two parameters : the product of the mass of the planet and the disk accretion rate ( @xmath46 ) , and the disk inner radius ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , we varied both @xmath46 and @xmath27 and the resulting seds of accreting circumplanetary disks are shown in figure [ fig : sed ] as the black curves , assuming that the disk is observed face on .",
    "the solid curves represent the cases with @xmath47 while the dotted curves are calculated with @xmath48 . the distance to the object",
    "is assumed to be 100 pc which is the typical distance to the closest star forming region .",
    "for comparison , the red curves are the seds of the 1 myr old planets at 100 pc based on the `` hot start '' models ( sb ) .",
    "the red curve with a brighter flux is from a 10 m@xmath1 planet while the red curve with a weaker flux is from a 1 m@xmath1 planet .",
    "we have also plotted the seds based on the `` cold start '' models as the blue curves ( sb ) .",
    "similarly , the blue curve with a brighter flux is from a 10 m@xmath1 planet while the blue curve with a weaker flux is from a 1 m@xmath1 planet .",
    "these planet models correspond to the 1 m@xmath1 , 10 m@xmath1 , `` hot / cold start '' models at an age of 1 myr in table 1 and figure 6 of sb . since sb only gives the spectra from 0.8 - 15 @xmath40 m , we also plot the seds from the blackbody having the corresponding planet size and effective temperature ( temperatures are labeled along the curves ) as the colored dotted curves . for another comparison ,",
    "the green curve is the sed of the protostar gm aur ( model spectrum from zhu et al .",
    "2012 ) scaled to 100 pc .",
    "the peak of the sed ( after reddening correction ) and/or spectral lines are mainly determined by the maximum temperature of the steady disk model @xmath49 thus , a disk around a 1 m@xmath1 planet accreting at @xmath50 ( labeled with @xmath51m@xmath52/yr in the upper left panel of figure [ fig : sed ] ) has a similar optical and near - ir sed as the 2300 k blackbody ( e.g. , a late m - type brown dwarf , burrows et al .  2001 , or a 10 m@xmath1 planet with a `` hot start '' , sb ) .",
    "the true luminosity of a flat disk @xmath53 is determined by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the distance to the system , @xmath56 is the inclination angle of the disk to the line of sight , and @xmath57 is the observed total flux corrected for extinction .",
    "thus , accreting circumplanetary disks can be quite bright .",
    "a disk accreting at @xmath50 is as bright as a late - m / early - l type brown dwarf .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] shows that , at near to mid ir , the accreting circumplanetary disk is normally brighter than a 1 myr old 1 m@xmath1 planet no matter whether the planet is `` cold '' or `` hot start '' as long as @xmath58m@xmath52 yr@xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the disk spectrum is redder than a single blackbody spectrum , providing a way to distinguish the accretion disk from a planet or a background star .",
    "it also demonstrates that direct imaging at longer wavelengths will provide a higher contrast ratio for the circumplanetary disk with respect to the planet .",

    "the truncation radius @xmath85 is also the inner radius of the accretion disk @xmath27 .",
    "the planet radius is assumed to be r@xmath1 .",
    "two filling factors ( @xmath95=0.1 and 0.01 ) have been assumed .",
    "thus , the total sed from the planet - disk system has three components in the scenario of magnetospheric accretion : emission from the planet ( red and blue curves in figure [ fig : sed ] ) , emission from the heated photosphere with a filling factor of @xmath95 on the planet surface ( dotted and dashed curves in figure [ fig : sedshock ] ) , and emission from the accretion disk ( thin solid curves in figure [ fig : sedshock ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sedshock ] shows that the hot heated photosphere can lead to strong optical and near - ir flux , and its sed can be even hotter and brighter than the sed from the planet . the blackbody assumption for the heated photosphere",
    "is highly simplified .",
    "the sed from the heated photosphere would be closer to that from an atmosphere of the given @xmath106 .",
    "since the total sed consists of these three components , the lines emitted by each component could be shallower / veiled due to the emission from other components .",
    "besides the uv / optical excess and line veiling , another observational signature of magnetospheric accretion is emission of atomic lines ( e.g. balmer , paschen and na d lines ) . estimating the line flux is more difficult since these lines come from the whole magnetosphere , and we know little on the heating mechanisms there ( e.g. heating by shocks , mhd waves ) .",
    "if we adopt the typical temperature values of the magnetosphere constrained from ctts ( @xmath3 8000 k ) , we can roughly estimate the line flux of h@xmath108 . at the typical scale of r@xmath19 across the magnetosphere of ctts , h@xmath108 is optically thick with 8000 k and @xmath109 cm@xmath63 ( storey & hummer 1995 ) .",
    "although the magnetosphere of planets is smaller , the density is significantly higher ( equation [ eq : rhoplanet ] ) so that h@xmath108 is still optically thick . at @xmath110 cm@xmath63 ,",
    "the lower levels of h are controlled by collisions ( hartmann et al .",
    "1994 ) , so that the source function for h@xmath108 is the planck function .",
    "thus , considering the size of the magnetosphere is @xmath111 , the line luminosity would be @xmath112 where i assume that the line is a box of width @xmath113 ( broadened by the infall ) and the height of @xmath114 .",
    "since @xmath115 is the flux at the line center , equation ( [ eq : lhplanet ] ) is the upper limit of the line flux .",
    "another reason for this estimate to be the upper limit is that , at high densities ( @xmath116 cm@xmath63 ) , h can be in local thermal equilibrium and the continuum emission can be as strong as the line emission .",
    "nevertheless , the typical value in equation ( [ eq : lhplanet ] ) is three orders of magnitude lower than the typical value from ctts ( @xmath117l@xmath19 in herczeg & hillenbrand 2008 ; rigliaco et al .",
    "2012 ) due to one order of magnitude smaller truncation radius and one order of magnitude smaller infall velocity .",

    "these @xmath118 values are all close or smaller than our upper limit given by equation ( [ eq : lhplanet ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lhplanet ] ) does not show the known correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath118 ( herczeg & hillenbrand 2008 ; rigliaco et al .",
    "we suggest then that the filling factor , or total azimuthal coverage , of the accretion flow provides the correlation between the accretion rate and the emission - line flux .",
    "realistically , the flow is not azimuthally axisymmetric but is probably separated into discrete magnetic flux tubes or `` funnel flows '' .",
    "this is especially likely if the magnetic field is tilted with respect to the stellar rotation axis , such that accretion will occur preferentially where the field lines bow inward toward the star . in this scenario ,",
    "higher accretion rates result in a larger number of ( or wider ) discrete flows , providing a larger emitting region and hence stronger line fluxes .",
    "there must be a relatively symmetric distribution of flows around the star , so that the full range of red- and blueshifted velocities are in emission ( for instance , a single discrete flow aligned along the line of sight to the star would result in a profile with a highly redshifted peak and little emission blueward of line center , which has not been observed in ctts , muzerolle et al .",
    "2001 ) . overall equation ( [ eq : lhplanet ] ) suggests that h@xmath108 luminosity is proportional to the square of the magnetosphere radius so that h@xmath108 luminosity may decrease significantly when the objects are in the planet mass regime due to their weak magnetic fields .",
    "we have made a major simplification by assuming that the circumplanetary disk accretes at a constant rate throughout the whole disk .",
    "on the other hand , recent 3-d simulations ( machida et al .",
    "2008 , tanigawa et al .",
    "2012 , szulagyi et al .",
    "2014 ) have suggested that gas enters the circumplanetary disk almost vertically from the circumstellar disk .",
    "this vertical infall can even be significant at two jupiter radii ( szulagyi et al .",
    "martin & lubow ( 2011 ) has suggested that the standard accretion disk picture only stands inward of where the vertical entrainment occurs .",
    "the spectrum of radiation from the region between the mass infall radius and the outer edge of the disk corresponds to that of a decretion disk ( equation 66 in martin & lubow 2011 ) with @xmath126 instead of @xmath127 for an accretion disk ( pringle 1981 , lee 1991 ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass infall may not occur at a single radius , but instead a wide range of radii .",
    "thus , assuming the disk accretion rate at the disk radius @xmath128 equals to the integrated infall rate beyond @xmath128 , the disk accretion rate decreases with @xmath128 . both of the decretion disk structure and decreasing @xmath22 lead to steeper temperature profile with radii . to explore this effect ,",
    "we have calculated the sed of a disk with @xmath129 by multiplying equation [ eq : fv ] with @xmath130 ( again , the temperature at @xmath131 is assumed to be the same as that at @xmath132 ) . assuming @xmath133 and @xmath134m@xmath135/yr , the obtained j , h , k , l",

    "thus , the disk becomes slightly fainter and the slope of the sed becomes slightly steeper due to the steeper temperature profile .",
    "the standard accretion disk model is based on the assumption that local turbulence is responsible for both angular momentum transport and energy dissipation .",
    "however , circumplanetary disks feel strong tidal forces from the central star .",
    "this tidal force can drive global spiral arms and shocks in circumplanetary disks , leading to accretion . 2-d and 3-d simulations ( rivier et al .",
    "2012 , szulagyi et al .",
    "2014 ) have shown that the accretion induced by tidal forces is @xmath136 assuming that dissipation in the circumplanetary disk leads to a steady accretion .",
    "however , shock dissipation is unlikely to be uniform throughout the circumplanetary disk and mass may pile up in the disk by shock dissipation . in this case ,",
    "local turbulence is still needed for accretion onto the planet .",
    "another mechanism for global angular momentum transport is the disk wind .",
    "the wind can lead to significantly less energy dissipation compared with the dissipation in viscous models .",
    "recent mhd simulations by gressel et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have suggested that a magnetocentrifugal wind develops in circumplanetary disks .",
    "future work is required to know the fraction of angular momentum and energy carried by disk wind versus the local turbulence .    regarding the sed calculations , when @xmath137 with @xmath138 , our assumption that the disk is optically thick marginally stands within the dust sublimation radius where the opacity is dominated by molecular opacity .",
    "in this case , the disk may have a different temperature structure than that obtained through the grey atmosphere assumption .",
    "cooling through molecular lines may be quite important in this case .",
    "finally , we discuss how mass can be transported in circumplanetary disks .",
    "the disk needs to be hot enough to sustain mri .",
    "when the disk accretion rate is too low , viscous heating may not provide enough thermal ionization to sustain mri . by assuming @xmath138 , the disk thermal structure has been calculated ( following zhu et al .",
    "2009 ) and we plot the radius where the disk midplane temperature reaches 1400 k in figure [ fig : unstable1 ] . as shown , when @xmath139 , mri can not be sustained by thermal ionization in the disk .",
    "the disk may need to rely on non - thermal ionization at the disk surface to sustain mri , which is quite uncertain ( fujii et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 , turner et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the disk sed calculations suggest that , at near - ir wavelengths ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 bands ) , a moderately accreting circumplanetary disk ( @xmath2 ) can be as bright as a late m - type brown dwarf or a 10@xmath140 planet with a `` hot start '' , since a late m - type dwarf ( basri et al .",
    "2000 ) and a 10 m@xmath1 planet with a `` hot start '' ( sb ) both have t@xmath141 2300 k and the radius of jupiter .",
    "this result implies that recently discovered high mass young planet / brown dwarf candidates that are in protoplanetary disks ( neuhuser et al .",
    "2005 ; itoh et al .  2005 ;",
    "kraus & ireland 2012 ; quanz et al .",
    "2013 ) could also be accreting circumplanetary disks around low mass planets .    to distinguish the accretion disk around a low mass planet ( e.g. , 1 m@xmath1 ) from a brown dwarf or a hot high mass planet ,",
    "it is crucial to obtain the photometry at mid - ir bands ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 bands ) for these objects .",
    "since the total flux of an accretion disk is from different disk annuli having a wide range of temperatures , the seds of accretion disks fall off slower towards longer wavelengths than the rayleigh- jeans tail of the seds of brown dwarfs or planets ( figure [ fig : sed ] ) .    searching for circumplanetary disks at radio wavelengths",
    "is also appealing due to alma s high sensitively ( isella et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , dust in circumplanetary disks may be depleted due to particle trapping at the planet opened gap edge ( rice et al .  2006 , zhu et al",
    ".  2012 ) or depleted due to radiation pressure from the accreting planets ( owen 2014 ) .",
    "if the planet can have a strong magnetic field , the field can truncate the accreting circumplanetary disk to produce other accretion signatures , including optical / uv excess from the heated photosphere due to accretion shocks , line veiling , and @xmath142 emission from magnetospheric accretion .",
    "gyrosynchrotron radiation modulated at a short period could also be a good indicator for magnetospheric accretion around planets ( lovelace et al .",
    "the heated photosphere produces a high temperature spectrum but from a small emitting area with the filling factor of @xmath95 on the planet surface , which is distinguishable from the emission from the planet and the disk .",

    ", we caution that @xmath142 line flux sensitively depends on the size of the magnetosphere , which could be small if the magnetic field of the planet is weak (  4 ) .",
    "the outer region of the circumplanetary disk , which is close to the roche sphere , may also experience strong dissipation due to shock formation by the infall or kelvin - helmholtz instability at the position where infall meets the disk ( similar to the `` hot spot '' in cataclysmic variables ) .",
