    "relativistic collisions involving heavy high - z ions provide an opportunity for comprehensive testing of our understanding of elementary processes related to ultrafast electromagnetic interactions and serve thus as an important testing ground for fundamental atomic theories .",
    "one of the elementary processes is the ionization of a strongly bound projectile electron caused by the coulomb interaction with the target nucleus . for relativistic @xcite and even ultra - relativistic collisions @xcite",
    ", this process has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies over many years where the validity of pertubation theory , the proper choice of wavefunction and the relevance of the magnetic part of the interaction were in the focus of the investigations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "very recently k - shell ionization has attracted particular attention as a tool for atomic structure investigation @xcite since for few - electron ions this process exhibits an extra ordinary state selectivity @xcite . in general ,",
    "an overall agreement between experimental data and refined theoretical treatments can be stated but there is still an indication of a small but systematic deviation between experiment and theory for very asymmetric collision systems @xcite where first order perturbation theory is expected to be an excellent approximation .",
    "compared to ionization , coulomb excitation is mediated by the same interaction mechanism , but , the projectile electron is excited into a bound state of the ion and not into the continuum . therefore",
    ", a much better experimental control can be expected by measuring the de - excitation photons .",
    "earlier experimental and theoretical studies for high - z have focused on total cross - sections for k - shell electron excitation by using h- and he - like bi and h - like au projectiles @xcite .",
    "the results obtained have shown , in particular , the importance of the magnetic part of the lienard - wiechert interaction , namely the need to include the magnetic term coherently into the excitation amplitude , leading to reduced total excitation cross sections .",
    "this coherent incorporation of the electric and magnetic parts of the interaction potential is in contrast to any quasi - relativistic approach in which these contributions are added incoherently and which has been applied quite successfully for the description of the ionization process . in ref .",
    "@xcite , simultaneous excitation and ionization of he - like uranium has been addressed .",
    "the obtained experimental cross sections when compared to relativistic calculations based on the independent particle approximation and first - order perturbation theory have provided reasonable agreement for lighter targets whereas for heavy targets systematic deviations have been observed . in @xcite ,",
    "relativistic symmetric eikonal model was applied for the description of this process which provided significantly better agreement with the experimental results .",
    "compared to total cross - sections , differential measurements often provide more detailed insights into the mechanism of a particular process @xcite . as an example , for radiative electron capture ( rec ) into high - z ions , former investigations of angular differential photon emission and alignment of the associated excited states gave access to many subtle details of relativistic atomic collision dynamics as well as of the electronic structure of high - z ions @xcite .",
    "in addition , we like to note that the alignment and polarization phenomena in ion - atom collisions have been studied in several earlier investigations in particular for low - z ions ( see for example @xcite ) . the k - shell x - ray radiation produced by electron capture ( and in few cases via excitation ) in few - electron ions from target atoms has been found to be anisotropic and the corresponding orientation and alignment parameters have been obtained by measuring the x - ray polarization or angular differential cross sections @xcite .",
    "however , in those studies mainly low - z ions in the relatively low collision energy regime have been investigated . besides , in most of the cases it has not been possible to unambiguously resolve individual transitions contributing to the observed x - ray lines .    in this work , we present the first experimental study of the angular differential photon emission following the k - shell excitation of the heaviest h- and he - like systems in relativistic collisions with n@xmath1 molecules . from the angular - resolved measurement of the x - ray emission following",
    "k - shell excitation we were able to determine the associated population distributions for the magnetic l - shell sub - levels belonging to the @xmath2 state in h - like uranium and to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 state in he - like uranium , respectively .",
    "the results display a very different behavior for the two ( hydrogen- and helium - like ) systems under consideration , contradicting the usual viewpoint that the coupling of the electrons and their interaction only plays a minor role in the high - z regime .",
    "the paper is structured as follows ; in the next section , the experimental arrangement as well as the experimental method is described , in section [ results ] , we then present the data analysis and compare our experimental results for sub - shell- and angular - differential cross - sections with the predictions of a fully relativistic theory . in section [ summary ] ,",
    "finally , a short summary and conclusions are given .",
    "experimental information about coulomb excitation of one- and few - electron projectiles occurring in relativistic atomic collisions is very scarce .",
    "the lack of data arises mainly from experimental difficulties due to the fact that excitation is not accompanied by a projectile charge exchange . as a consequence , this process can usually only be studied in single pass experiments by measuring the photon production in coincidence with primary beams of low intensity @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative experimental approach has been introduced at the experimental storage ring ( esr ) at gsi where projectile excitation has been studied by detecting the projectile x - ray emission in anti - coincidence with charge exchange @xcite . in our study we have utilized this technique to extend the earlier investigations to a more detailed analysis of the coulomb excitation of u@xmath5 , u@xmath6 and their angular - differential x - ray emission in relativistic collisions with n@xmath1 target .",
    "@xmath7n@xmath1 collisions at the forward angle of close to 10  @xmath8 : ( a ) total emission spectrum without coincidence requirement ; ( b ) photons in coincidence with electron capture , @xmath9 transitions in he - like uranium ; ( c ) photons in anti - coincidence with electron capture , @xmath10 transitions in h - like uranium .",
    "the insets show the corresponding level schemes and transitions.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the experiment was performed at the esr by using h- and he - like uranium ions delivered by the heavy ion synchrotron ( sis ) at an energy of 217  mev / u .",
    "an efficient electron cooling in the esr storage ring provided beams with very low emittance ( beam size of less than 5 mm ) and a longitudinal momentum spread of @xmath11 which enabled storage of the beam with long lifetimes as well as a decrease of the uncertainties due to the relativistic doppler effect .",
    "after injection in the ring and following cooling , the ion beam interacted with a supersonic jet of n@xmath1 target . for the experiment ,",
    "the atomic physics photon detection chamber of the internal target of the esr was utilized . here",
    ", projectile x - rays produced in collisions of the stored ion beams with the jet - target were detected by an array of solid state detectors , covering observation angles in the range between 10@xmath12 and 150@xmath12 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the ge(i ) photon detectors were energy and efficiency calibrated before the experiment using a set of appropriate radioactive sources .",
    "in addition , those projectile ions that captured an electron were detected after the next dipole magnet of the esr with a multiwire proportional counter ( mwpc ) .",
    "a detailed description of the detection setup at the esr jet - target and of the utilized anticoincidence technique can be found in @xcite and in references therein .    as an example , we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] x - ray spectra recorded for u@xmath5@xmath7 n@xmath1 collisions at the forward angle of close to 10@xmath12 . in the total spectra ( a ) , measured without any coincidence condition , the characteristic transitions arising from both electron capture ( k@xmath13 transitions in he - like uranium ) and from excitation ( ly@xmath13 transitions in h - like uranium ) are clearly visible . applying a coincidence requirement with the down - charged projectile , we obtain the characteristic x - ray spectra corresponding exclusively to the events of capture of one electron from the @xmath14 into initially h - like uranium ( u@xmath5 ) .",
    "furthermore , by substraction of the spectrum corresponding to a capture ( b ) from the total one ( a ) we obtain the spectrum in anti - coincidence with the projectile charge exchange ( c ) which comprises only the events corresponding to @xmath0 excitation ( and following decay ) of the projectile electron .",
    "indeed , no he - like k@xmath13 transitions are observed in the anti - coincidence spectrum .",
    "this also proves that the mwpc detector used for particle detection operates with a detection efficiency very close to 100% .",
    "the exponential background observed in the excitation spectrum stems from electron bremsstrahlung .",
    "in the same way , a spectrum containing only the events corresponding to @xmath0 excitation has also been obtained for he - like projectiles . in this case , the situation is even more favorable because k - shell transitions can only be produced by a k - shell excitation .    finally , we like to note that the data for initially h- and he - like uranium have been acquired with an identical detector setup in sequential order during the same beam time .",
    "the ion beam position was defined by the target in both cases , and thus , stayed unchanged .",
    "therefore , the detector geometry with respect to the beam axis was the same for the both beams .",
    "this is very important since it allows to normalize the observed yields of x - ray transitions in he - like ions to the line intensity of ly-@xmath15 transition which is known to be precisely isotropic ( see below ) .",
    "in the following , we focus on the angular distributions of characteristic x - rays following the excitation of h- and he - like projectiles . such an angle - resolved analysis will enable us to gain insight into a mechanism of formation of excited ionic sub - states in relativistic ion - atom collisions .",
    "the information on the magnetic sublevel population of the excited ion can be directly extracted from the angular distribution of de - excitation photons that can be written in the projectile ( emitter ) frame as :    @xmath16    here , @xmath17 is the angle between the direction of the de - excitation photon and the beam direction while @xmath18 denotes the second - order legendre polynomial .",
    "the emission pattern ( 1 ) is completely determined by the effective anisotropy parameter @xmath19 whose particular form depends on the transition under consideration . for example , for the ly@xmath15 ( @xmath20 ) decay in h - like ions , the anisotropy @xmath21 includes not only the alignment parameter :    @xmath22    which can be written in terms of the partial cross sections @xmath23 for populating the magnetic substates @xmath24 , and the so - called structure function @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this function describes the interference between the leading e1 and the much weaker m2 decay channels and contributes by as much as @xmath26 to the angular distribution of the characteristic photon emission from h - like uranium ions .",
    "in contrast to the ly@xmath15 transition , no multipole - mixing can occur for the decay of the @xmath27 ^3p_1 $ ] and @xmath28 ^1p_1 $ ] states in he - like ions since they can only decay via a fast e1 transition to the groundstate . for the @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) transitions ,",
    "therefore , the angular distribution ( 1 ) is governed by the anisotropy parameter @xmath33 where the alignment parameter reads :    @xmath34    here , the partial cross sections @xmath35 describe the dynamics of excitation of the _ two - electron _",
    "projectiles @xcite .",
    "-transition normalized to the ly@xmath36 line intensity as function of observation angle for 217 mev / u u@xmath5@xmath7n@xmath1 collisions .",
    "the solid line refers to a fit of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( transformed into the laboratory frame ) to the data .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in our experiment , we strongly benefit from the fact that the ly@xmath36 transition arising from the decay of the 2s@xmath37 and 2p@xmath37 levels is known to be precisely isotropic .",
    "consequently , this line provides an ideal tool to measure a possible anisotropy of the close - spaced ly@xmath15 or k@xmath13 transitions . by using this transition for normalization purposes , various systematic effects , associated for example with solid angle corrections , possible error in detector efficiency calibration , etc .",
    "cancel out .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied in previous studies @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the result for the emission pattern of the ly@xmath15 ( 2p@xmath381s@xmath37 ) transition is shown , normalized to the ly@xmath36 intensity .",
    "the angular distribution is fairly isotropic . from this experimental result",
    "we extract the value of the alignment parameter for the 2p@xmath39 state by fitting the eq . [ 1 ] ( transformed into the laboratory frame ) to the observed angular distributions ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy coefficient @xmath19 and an overall amplitude of the fit function were kept as free fit parameters . from this procedure",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath40 for the alignment @xmath41@xmath1 that is consistent with the isotropic angular distribution .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is entirely of statistical origin .",
    "this finding is in agreement with theoretical predictions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) showing no alignment for the particular collision energy used in the experiment . here , we like to note that this result is markedly different to earlier findings obtained for the same transition in @xmath42 ( 2p@xmath381s@xmath37 ) but caused by rec ( the same beam energy and the same target ) @xcite where a very strong alignment has been observed .",
    "moreover , in our experiment we observed a very different behavior for the k - shell excitation of he - like uranium as compared to the h - like case . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the k@xmath15 and k@xmath36 the angular distributions as measured for k - shell excitation of he - like uranium in 217 mev / u u@xmath6@xmath7n@xmath1 collisions are presented , normalized to the ly@xmath36 yield as obtained for h - like uranium . as seen from the figure , the data ( especially k@xmath36 ( @xmath43 ^ 3p_1\\rightarrow 1 ^ 1s_0 $ ] ) ) exhibit a pronounced deviation from a constant intensity ratio .",
    "( top part ) and k@xmath36 ( bottom part ) measured for k - shell excitation of he - like uranium in collisions with n@xmath1 at 217 mev / u . in addition , fits of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( transformed into the laboratory frame ) to the corresponding experimental data are shown by solid lines.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    let us note here , moreover , that for the case of k - shell excitation of high - z he - like ions , only the @xmath44 ^ 1p_1 $ ] and the @xmath43 ^ 3p_1 $ ] states are predicted to be populated and contribute to the observed k@xmath15 and k@xmath36 transitions @xcite . in both cases",
    "an alignment of the different sublevels is possible . as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , there is a significant positive alignment for the @xmath43 ^ 3p_1 $ ] level ( k@xmath36 transition ) and a relatively weak negative alignment for the @xmath43 ^ 1p_1 $ ] state ( k@xmath15 transition ) . applying the same procedure as for the case of the h - like ions ( described above ) we obtained values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the alignment parameters of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , respectively .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are entirely of statistical origin .",
    "we can compare these experimental results with values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 given by a recent fully relativistic calculations @xcite . in these computations , both the coupling of the electrons as well as their repulsive interaction have been taken into account within the framework of the multiconfiguration dirac - fock method ( mcdf ) .",
    "these calculations included moreover the cascade feeding ( following an initial excitation into states with @xmath49 ) and its effect upon the aligment of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , in addition to the aligment as obtained for a direct @xmath0 excitation .",
    "as known for the photo - induced excitation of atoms and ions @xcite , the different sign in the alignment of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states arises from the different coupling of the two electrons . though the aligment differs quite considerably for these two states , it may be both negative ( low projectile energies ) or positive ( high projectile energies ) as seen from figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "let us note that this qualitative behavior of the alignment as a function of energy has been already predicted by earlier non - relativistic calculations for @xmath50 excitation @xcite and it holds also true for excitation of h - like systems ( @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "this finding is simply related to the fact that with increasing energy more angular momentum is transferred to the system so that transitions with @xmath52=@xmath53 ( he - like system ) start to dominate @xcite . from the comparison in figure [ fig4 ] , a very good agreement with the experimental result for the alignment of the @xmath3 state can be seen . for the @xmath4 level , the theoretical value is smaller than the experimental one , however , the deviation is not particularly pronounced due to the experimental uncertainty . here",
    "it is important to note that the theoretical values include only the coulomb excitation due to the target nucleus and omit completely the process of electron impact excitation .",
    "coulomb excitation caused by the nuclear charge @xmath54 of the target scales with @xmath55 whereas the cross section for electron impact excitation scales linearly with the amount of target electrons available .",
    "therefore , for the particular case of nitrogen target we might expect that electron impact excitation contributes by about fifteen percent to the overall excitation cross section .",
    "in summary , we have performed the first experimental study of the magnetic - sublevel population for the k - shell excitation of hydrogen- and helium - like uranium in relativistic collisions with a low - z gaseous target .",
    "the information about the population of the magnetic sublevels in this process has been obtained via an angular differential study of the decay photons associated with coulomb excitation .",
    "the results presented in this work show a markedly different behavior for the different ion species ( h - like or he - like ) .",
    "the lyman transition ( 2p@xmath381s@xmath37 ) following k - shell excitation of h - like uranium has been found to be nearly isotropic and therefore the population of the magnetic sublevels follows a statistical distribution . for the @xmath0 excitation of he - like uranium , in contrast ,",
    "we have measured an non - zero alignment for both @xmath4 and @xmath3 states but with alignment parameters of opposite sign . though perhaps not very surprising in its own , this result can not be understood just within a single - electron model but requires to account for the coupling of the electrons as well as their interaction .",
    "this is remarkable as we are dealing with high - z ions for which the interaction among the electrons is commonly assumed to be of minor importance .",
    "the experimental data agree well with recent theoretical predictions @xcite in which both , the relativistic and magnetic interaction effects were taken into account and , thus , provide a meaningful description of the k - shell excitation process in relativistic collisions of high - z ions with low - z targets . however , since this is the only measurement for he - like uranium up to date , additional studies with different targets and different collision energies would be desirable to unravel especially the role of electron impact excitation in collisions of high - z ions with gaseous targets .",
    "these investigations will additionally be supported by the observation of linear polarization of the de - excitation x - rays as very recently introduced in experiments at the esr @xcite",
