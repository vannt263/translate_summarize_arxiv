    "recent data on mid - rapidity charged particle multiplicities in proton - proton collisions by the alice @xcite , cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations have extended the energy range of this observable up to @xmath4  tev .",
    "they show an @xmath5-dependence in @xmath2 .",
    "the same dependence is observed at lower energies .",
    "such an @xmath5-dependence , observed at high energies , has important consequences for the pomeron intercept .",
    "this is based on a very general property of multiple scattering models , known as the agk cancellation @xcite . as a result of this cancellation ,",
    "absorptive corrections ( i.e. multiple - scattering effects ) vanish identically in the single particle inclusive cross - section @xmath6 .",
    "this theorem is valid for a large class of multiple - scattering models , including eikonal and glauber type models .",
    "it is the equivalent in soft processes of the factorization theorem in perturbative qcd .",
    "consider the charged multiplicity @xmath7 .",
    "the data show an @xmath2 behaviour for @xmath8 . assuming that the total non - diffractive @xmath0 cross - section @xmath9 behaves as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , as observed at energies below lhc",
    ", we conclude that @xmath12 behaves as @xmath13 with @xmath14 . due to the agk cancellation",
    "this is the behaviour of single scattering ( born term ) and thus the pomeron intercept is @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite , has been prevoiusly used by alice collaboration @xcite to fit the central rapidity @xmath16 ratio as a function of the center - of - mass energy . ]    string models like dpm @xcite or qgsm @xcite do , of course , satisfy the agk cancellation .",
    "this cancellation is fully effective at mid - rapidities and high energies .",
    "energy conservation introduces violations in the fragmentation regions which , at low energies , propagate to mid rapidities .",
    "it turns out that some amount of violation is still present in mid - rapidity auau collisions at rhic @xcite which go away at mid - rapidities in the lhc energy range .",
    "consider next processes involving nuclei . here",
    "the agk cancellation implies that the charged multiplicities @xmath17 scale with the number of binary collisions , i.e. the same scaling behaviour valid in hard processes due to the factorization theorem .",
    "it is well - known that such a scaling is not supported by the data .",
    "actually , the recent alice data @xcite , lately confirmed by cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations , show that the mid - rapidity charged multiplicity per participant pair @xmath18 in central pbpb collisions at @xmath3  tev is about two times larger than in @xmath0 collisions at the same energy .",
    "however , the agk cancellation implies that this ratio should be equal to the ratio @xmath19 which is about five at rhic and increases with energy .",
    "the factor of two in @xmath20 relative to @xmath0 , conveys the idea of a greater efficiency of @xmath1 collisions for particle production in each binary collision .",
    "however , the surprising fact is the strong suppression of the @xmath1 multiplicity as compared to the predictions of the eikonal - glauber model .",
    "the solution of this puzzle is the presence in @xmath1 collisions of the so - called shadowing corrections , not included in that model .",
    "these corrections are small in @xmath0 but are quite large in @xmath1 collisions where they are enhanced by @xmath21 factors . in view of that , it is clear that an analysis of the results mentioned above puts strong constraints on the size and energy dependence of shadowing .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the physical bases of both agk cancellation and shadowing . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we study the mid - rapidity @xmath0 and @xmath1 charged multiplicities , respectively .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "let us recall the physical bases of the agk cancellation @xcite and shadowing @xcite .",
    "a simple way to illustrate the agk cancellation is to consider the cross - section @xmath22 for @xmath23 inelastic collisions in @xmath24 scattering in the probabilistic glauber model [ 1e ] _",

    "( [ 1e ] ) is the number of ways to choose @xmath23 interacting nucleons out of @xmath26 .",
    "the second one in the probability that @xmath23 nucleons interact at fixed impact parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the third factor is the probability for no interaction of the remaining @xmath28 nucleons . upon summation of ( [ 1e ] ) from @xmath29 to @xmath26 and integration in @xmath27",
    "one obtains the non - diffractive @xmath24 cross - section .",
    "it can be seen numerically that it behaves like @xmath30 with @xmath31 . on the contrary for the multiplicity we have [ 2e ] dn^pa d = 1 _ pa  _",
    "_ ^pa  dn^pp d  dn^pp d    with @xmath32 .",
    "the factor @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) is due to the fact that , in the presence of @xmath23 non - diffractive inelastic collisions , the trigger particle can be produced in any of them .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) is equivalent to @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath34 scales with @xmath26 and @xmath35 scales with the number of binary collisions . in the former observable all multiple scattering contributions",
    "cancel identically and one is left with the scaling in @xmath36 of the born term .",
    "the same cancellation takes place in @xmath1 collisions in the glauber - gribov model ( see section 4 ) and in @xmath0 in the eikonal model ( see section 3 ) . in the framework of reggeon field theory @xcite the agk cancellation is illustrated in fig .",

    "@xmath39 there is a net contribution @xmath40 ( absorptive correction ) which reduces the @xmath26 dependence , while in @xmath41 the net contribution is zero .",

    "this increase in @xmath52 leads to a decrease in the residue of the pomeron to which the constant @xmath53 is proportional .",
    "this induces a reduction of its value to @xmath66  @xmath56 . with these values of @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath52 the values of the shadowing suppression factor differ from the old ones by less than 10% in the energy range between @xmath67  gev and 5.5 tev .",

    "multiple scattering in hadron - hadron collisions is usually described in a generalized eikonal model in which inelastic intermediate states are included in the vertex functions of the multiple scattering graphs .",

    "note that this value of @xmath87 is larger than the one in the born term due to the effect of the unitarity corrections .",
    "the parameter @xmath88  gev@xmath81 controls the size of the interaction cross section and has been determined from the absolute normalization of @xmath89 , which leads to the values given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that the energy dependence of @xmath89 is essentially determined by the pomeron intercept @xmath52 , and it is about @xmath90 , in agreement with experimental data .",

    "an increase larger than the one in @xmath0 has been observed between @xmath67  gev and 2.76 tev .",

    "we have studied the mid - rapidity charged particle multiplicities in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions in the lhc energy range .",
    "we have shown that the observed energy dependence of the @xmath0 multiplicity requires a pomeron intercept close to 1.2 .",
    "one obtains in this way an energy dependence remarkably close to @xmath2 , in good agreement with available data .",
    "this behaviour is predicted to hold up to at least 50 tev . at lower energies",
    "the calculated @xmath0 multiplicity is larger than the experimental one .",
    "the difference is about 15  % at @xmath67  gev .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with energy conservation effects which reduce the multiplicity and are present at low energies .",
    "these effects go away when we reach the lhc range .    in @xmath1 collisions",
    "the centrality dependence of the multiplicity is predicted to be practically identical at @xmath3 and 5.5 tev , in agreement with lower energy extrapolations .",
    "its size is well reproduced .",
    "the increase in multiplicity with energy between 2.76 and 5.5 tev is predicted to be slightly less than the one in @xmath0 , while a larger increase is expected from lower energy results which show an energy dependence in @xmath107 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the obtained pomeron intercept is larger than the conventional one used in most models obtained from lower energy data . in this respect",
    "one can consider two different scenarios .",
    "a first possibility @xcite is that a pomeron intercept close to 1.2 can describe the data at all energies when all multiple scattering contributions are taken into account together with low energy corrections such as energy conservation effects in the multiplicities .",
    "a second scenario is the so - called pomeron flavoring @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the pomeron intercept increases due to the opening up of effective thresholds for heavy flavor production as the energy increases .",
    "actually the incorporation of semi - hard events ( mini - jets ) within dpm @xcite can be considered a flavoring phenomenon @xcite .",
    "calculations of the @xmath0 multiplicity at lhc in the framework of the qgsm @xcite can be found in @xcite . in these calculations",
    "the pomeron intercept is taken to be 1.12 . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath0 multiplicity is substantially smaller than ours .",
    "monte carlo models such as pythia @xcite and phojet @xcite also have a too small energy dependence in the lhc range @xcite .",
    "all these results lend support to the necessity of a higher pomeron intercept .",
    "obviously our value of an intercept close to 1.2 has to be validated by a measurement of the energy dependence up to 14 tev .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of our friend and long - time collaborator alexei kaidalov . he was a world expert in the field discussed in this paper , to which he has made outstanding contributions .",
    "we have benefited from his creativity and deep knowledge of the field during many years of fruitful and stimulating collaboration .",
