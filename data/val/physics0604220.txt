    "techniques for trapping small number of atoms in a microscopic volume have recently become an important tool for wide range of experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics such as cold collisions @xcite , atom metrology @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite and quantum information @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous measurements of trap loading and loss parameters of a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) with many atoms , but they used indirect methods such as fitting to a model curve , @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the density of trapped atoms , @xmath2 the loss rate due to collisions with background atoms , and @xmath3 a coefficient for two - atom collisional process among trapped atoms . recently , several groups have trapped a small number of atoms in a mot with a strong magnetic field gradient and could observe individual loading and loss events in real time . in this way , loading rate @xmath4 , one - atom loss rate @xmath5 , and two - atom loss rate @xmath6 have been directly measured @xcite .    the atom - number correlation function has also been measured from the observed sequence of instantaneous atom number in a trap @xcite . since no analytic solution is known for the master equation in the limit of non - negligible two - atom loss , the study of the atom - number correlation function has been limited to the case of no two - atom loss , for which the correlation function does not provide any further information other than the one - atom loss rate .",
    "in the present work , we provide a comprehensive frame work for investigation of the atom - number correlation function based on the master equation ( chaps .",
    "ii and iii ) .",
    "an approximate formula has been derived for the correlation function in the limit of non - negligible two - atom loss ( chap .",
    "iv ) and the validity of the approximate formula has been put to a test by numerical simulations ( chap .",
    "the time dynamics of the atom number @xmath7 in a trap is governed by loading and loss processes .",
    "the loading process occurs at a certain rate @xmath4 , called loading rate , which is determined by capture ability of the trap .",
    "the capture ability depends on such experimental conditions as laser intensity , laser beam size , laser - atom detuning and background source density of atoms but not on the number of atoms trapped already .",
    "we can assume @xmath4 as a constant under fixed experimental condition .",
    "the loss rates , on the other hand , are affected by the number of atoms in the trap .",
    "one - atom loss occurs when one of the trapped atoms collides with a fast - moving background atom of different kind .",
    "one atom loss rate is thus linearly proportional to the number of atoms @xmath7 already present in the trap .",
    "we define @xmath8 as the one - atom loss _ coefficient _ in such a way that the one atom loss _ rate _ @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "two - atom loss process is due to the collision between two of the trapped atoms .",
    "there are several types of two - atom collision processes responsible for two - atom losses .",
    "they are ground - state hyperfine - changing collisions , ground - excited - state fine - structure changing collision and ground - excited - state radiative escape .",
    "whenever these collisions occur , the colliding two atoms can gain enough kinetic energy for escaping from the trap @xcite .",
    "therefore , the two - atom loss rate is proportional to the number of two - atom combinations for the atoms in the trap . in terms of",
    "@xmath11 the two - atom loss _",
    "coefficient _ , the two - atom loss _ rate _",
    "@xmath12 is then given by @xmath13 .",
    "the loading and loss processes occur randomly .",
    "due to random nature of these processes , it is more convenient to treat the problem in terms of the atom number distribution function @xmath14 than to deal with the time variation of the instantaneous atom number @xmath7 itself . in order to understand the connection between time evolution of @xmath15 and that of @xmath7 ,",
    "let us suppose that we turn on the loading process at time @xmath16 and observe the atom number , initially zero , afterwards .",
    "the atom number will change randomly as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but the center of fluctuation will increase to a steady - state value determined by the balance between the loading and loss processes .    . for each member of the ensemble",

    "( c ) ensemble averaged atom number distribution at various times .",

    "however , if we average all of the observed time sequences with the initial starting time aligned , we obtain a distribution of atom numbers at any time @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath15 , and a sequence of averaged atom number as a function of time .",
    "alternatively , we can replace the infinitely many observations with an ensemble of identically prepared traps .",
    "the sequence of averaged atom number is then an ensemble average of the atom number @xmath18 .",
    "it is shown that the time evolution of the ensemble - averaged distribution @xmath15 can be described the following master equation : @xmath19 for @xmath20 with a convention of @xmath21 .",

    "a rate equation for the _ ensemble - averaged _ atom number @xmath18 in the trap can be derived from the eq .",

    "multiplication of @xmath7 to the both sides of eq .",

    "the upper bar indicates a time average in the steady state . from the properties of the poisson distribution we get the following relation between the variance and the mean .",

    "the correlation function of the atom number is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 is a time delay and the notation @xmath43 represents a time average .",
    "although the ensemble - averaged atom number @xmath18 does not change in the steady state , equal to the mean atom number @xmath44 , the atom number @xmath7 itself is continuously fluctuating around its mean .",
    "we can replace the time average above with an ensemble average .",
    "let us denote the atom number at time @xmath17 in the @xmath45th ensemble member as @xmath46 .",
    "then we can rewrite the correlation function as @xmath47 where the summation over @xmath45 is performed over all members of the ensemble .",
    "we can regroup the ensemble into sub - ensembles in such a way that the members in each sub - ensemble have a common initial atom number @xmath36 . since @xmath48 values are distributed according to @xmath14 of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath49\\ ; , % = \\sum_{n_{0}}^{\\infty}n_{0}p_{n_{0}}\\langle n(n_{0},\\tau)\\rangle   \\label{eq : cor - def2}\\ ] ] where the summation over @xmath50 represents a summation over each sub - ensemble .",
    "all sub - ensembles are statistically identical , described by the same master equation , eq .",
    "now , we can see that the quantity in @xmath51 $ ] is nothing but the ensemble - averaged atom number @xmath18 at time @xmath52 when its initial value is @xmath36 at time @xmath16 . the correlation function",
    "is then simplified as @xmath53    a differential equation for the correlation function can be obtained by taking a derivative of eq .",

    ", we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 and therefore , the normalized correlation function is @xmath59    the correlation function shows a decay behavior from @xmath60 to 1 with a characteristic correlation time @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the atom - number correlation function exhibits bunching , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , when the atom number distribution is poissonian whereas a poisson distribution for photon number does not necessarily means bunching for a photon number correlation function .",
    "if the density of atoms in a trap becomes higher , the two - atom loss terms are no longer negligible , and thus the full version of the master equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) , should be considered .",
    "however , the full master equation can not be solved analytically .",
    "instead , we rely on numerical solutions , either by monte - carlo simulation or an iteration method for given parameter values . such numerical studies are discussed elsewhere @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on approximate solutions to the master equation .",
    "the rate equation for @xmath18 with the two - atom loss terms can be derived from the master equation as @xmath64 in the steady state , we let @xmath65 . differently from the case of excluding two - atom loss terms ,",
    "however , we do not get any information about @xmath66 other than the following relation between the variance and the mean . @xmath67    following the same line of reasoning from eq .",
