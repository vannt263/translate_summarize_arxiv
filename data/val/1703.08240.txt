    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is a novel coupled - physics ( hybrid ) modality for non - invasive biomedical imaging that combines the high contrast of optical tomography with the high spatial resolution of acoustic imaging @xcite .",
    "its principle consists in illuminating a sample by an electromagnetic pulse that , due to the photoacoustic effect , generates pressure waves inside of the object ; see figure  [ fig : pat ] .",
    "the generated pressure waves ( the acoustic signals ) then propagate through the sample and beyond , and the pressure is recorded outside of the sample .",
    "finally , mathematical algorithms are used to reconstruct an image of the interior ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we work with the standard model of pat , where the acoustic pressure @xmath0 solves the standard wave equation ( see ) .",
    "the goal of pat is to recover the initial pressure distribution ( at time @xmath1 ) , given by a function @xmath2 , from measurements @xmath3 of the pressure that is recorded on the hyperplane @xmath4 .",
    "here , @xmath5 denotes the half space @xmath6 .",
    "that is , we assume that we know @xmath7 on @xmath8 ( the acquisition surface ) , and our goal is to reconstruct @xmath9 from ( possibly approximate ) knowledge of @xmath10 .",
    "this is an inverse problem , which amounts to an ( approximate ) inversion of the operator @xmath11",
    ". we will refer to that problem as the inverse problem of pat with a planar acquisition geometry .",
    "note that similar approaches can be considered for other acquisition geometries as well .",
    "a semitransparent sample is illuminated with a short optical pulse . due to optical absorption and subsequent thermal expansion an acoustic pressure wave",
    "is induced within the sample .",
    "the pressure waves are measured outside of the sample and used to reconstruct an image of the interior . ]    in the case of exact data @xmath12 , several approaches have been derived for solving the inverse problem of pat considering different acquisition geometries .",
    "this includes time reversal ( see @xcite ) , fourier domain algorithms ( see @xcite ) , analytic reconstruction formulas of back - projection type ( see @xcite ) , as well as iterative approaches @xcite . for the case of noisy data , it is well known that iterative methods ( including variational methods and sparse reconstructions ) tend to be more accurate than analytic methods .    among those iterative techniques , sparse regularization approaches",
    "have gained a lot of attention during the last years as they have proven to perform well for noisy data as well as for incomplete data problems .",
    "one of their main advantages consists in their ability to combine efficient regularization with good feature preservation and to ( to some extent ) to compensate for the missing data @xcite .",
    "however , these advantages of sparse regularization methods come with the cost of typically significantly longer reconstruction times than fbp - type approaches .",
    "this is because the forward and adjoint operators have to be evaluated repeatedly .",
    "due to that reason , fbp type methods ( or other direct approaches ) are often preferred over the more elaborate sparse regularization techniques @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop numerically efficient reconstruction method for pat with planar geometry that effectively deals with noisy data @xmath13 , where regularization is achieved by enforcing sparsity constraints in the reconstruction with respect to wavelet coefficients of @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , we derive a direct method for calculating a minimizer the @xmath14-tikhonov functional @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes an orthonormal wavelet basis and @xmath17 are weights . to achieve that , as one of our main results ,",
    "we construct a wavelet - vaguelette decomposition for the operator @xmath11 .",
    "that is , given a wavelet basis @xmath16 , we construct a system @xmath18 in @xmath19 that , in the case of exact data @xmath20 , gives rise to an inversion formula of the form @xmath21 .",
    "given noisy data @xmath13 , we show that a combination of this formula with soft - thresholding @xmath22 , namely @xmath23 provides a minimizer of the functional . additionally , we derive an efficient algorithm for the vaguelette transform @xmath24 and provide an implementation for the wvd reconstruction . moreover , we show order optimality of our method in the case of deterministic noise as well as is the case of gaussian random noise .",
    "we also consider generalizations of our method and , in particular , we show how wvd reconstruction can be combined with an additional tv - prior .",
    "sparse regularization has been widely used as a reconstruction method for general inverse problems and there is a vast literature on that topic ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the statistical setting ,",
    "@xmath14-tikhonov regularization is known as lasso @xcite or basis pursuit @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the reconstructions are computed by employing iterative algorithms ( such as iterative soft - thresholding ) to minimize the @xmath14-tikhonov functional @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", those methods have the disadvantage to be slower than fbp type methods , as the forward and adjoint problem have to be solved repeatedly .    wavelet - vaguelette decompositions and generalizations like biorthogonal curvelet decompositions and shearlet decompositions",
    "have been derived for the classical radon transform in 2d , see @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",

    "one recognizes that can be implemented by applying a hybrid wavelet - tv denoising algorithm to @xmath242 . following  @xcite , we rewrite the optimization problem   in the form @xmath243 and introduce the associated augmented lagrangian operator @xmath244 then , can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) , introduced in @xcite , which alternatingly performs minimization steps with respect to @xmath245 and @xmath246 and maximization steps with respect to @xmath247 . the resulting admm algorithm for solving",
    "is summarized in algorithm  [ alg : admm - tv ] .",
    "@xmath248    @xmath249    @xmath250    @xmath251    for performing the @xmath245-update in algorithm [ alg : admm - tv ] we have to solve the unconstraint total variation minimization problem @xmath252 . for this purpose",
    "we use chambolle s dual projection algorithm @xcite .      in this section",
    "we present a numerical example testing the vaguelette soft - thresholding and the hybrid approach .",
    "for that purpose we consider a simple phantom that consists of the superposition of three uniformly absorbing spheres as illustrated in the top image in figure  [ fig : fg ] .",
    "the data @xmath253 are computed numerically using an implementation according to . to simulate data errors , we added i.i.d gaussian noise with standard deviation @xmath254 . the relative @xmath255-error in the noisy data @xmath256 is @xmath257 .",
    "results of our reconstruction from noisy data are shown figure  [ fig : rec ] .",
    "the top image shows the non - regularized reconstruction @xmath258 , the middle image the vaguelette - thresholding reconstruction @xmath259 and the bottom image the reconstruction with the hybrid vaguelette - tv method @xmath260 .",
    "figure  [ fig : err ] shows corresponding difference images between the reconstructions and the true phantom @xmath245 .",
    "one clearly observes that the vaguelette estimators significantly reduce the error in the reconstruction",
    ". this can be quantified by the relative @xmath255-errors , which are equal to @xmath261 for the unregularized reconstruction , @xmath262 for the vaguelette thresholding estimator @xmath263 for the hybrid estimator .",
    "the relative @xmath255-error for the hybrid reconstruction is slightly larger than for the vaguelette - thresholding estimator .",
    "this is reasonable since the vaguelette - thresholding estimator minimizes the @xmath255-norm ( see ) among all potential reconstructions @xmath245 that are compatible with the data , whereas the hybrid estimator minimizes the total variation .",
    "however , in some more appropriate error measure the hybrid reconstruction may outperform the thresholding estimator .",
    "further note that all reconstruction methods contain some limited data artifacts , which can not removed completely by wavelet methods @xcite .",
    "in this paper we developed a regularization framework using wavelet sparsity in photoacoustic tomography .",
    "for that purpose we derived wavelet - vaguelette ( wvd ) decompositions ( see theorem  [ thm : wvd ] ) and an easy but efficient implementation of the corresponding vaguelette transform ( see  algorithm [ alg : v ] ) . using the wvd we derived an explicit formula for minimizing the sparse tikhonov functional that can be implemented without any iterative reconstruction procedure ( see algorithm  [ alg : soft ] ) .",
    "the considered regularization approach has been shown to provide optimal error estimates in the deterministic as well as in the stochastic setting ( see theorem  [ thm : random ] ) . in order to account for wavelet artifacts we also developed hybride regularization methods combining wavelet sparsity with total variation ( see algorithm  [ alg : admm - tv ] ) .",
    "numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our reconstruction approaches .",
    "future work will be done to extend our approach to more general measurements geometries in pat and also to different radon type inverse problems .",
    "we recall some basic facts about orthogonal wavelets as we need them for our purpose ( in particular in section [ sec : wvd ] ) . for task of function estimation",
    ", wavelets are known to sparsely represent many signals and , hence , they can be used to effectively encode prior information .",
    "another useful property of wavelets consists in the ability to characterize several classical smoothness measures ( eg .",
    "sobolev and besov norms ) in terms of the decay properties of wavelet coefficients .",
    "we will also use that property in section [ sec : noisy ] . for a detailed introduction to wavelets",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the construction of a wavelet onb is based on the concept of a multiresolution analysis ( msa ) , which is given by a sequence subspaces @xmath264 in @xmath265 that satisfy the following requirements ( see @xcite ) :    * for all @xmath266 it holds that @xmath267 . *",
    "the union @xmath268 is dense in @xmath269 . *",

    "the function @xmath276 is called _ scaling function _ and the spaces @xmath277 are called _ scaling ( or approximation ) spaces at scale j_. to each scaling space @xmath277 , one can associate a _ wavelet ( or detail ) space @xmath278 _ , that are defined to be the orthogonal complements of @xmath277 in @xmath279 , i.e. , @xmath280 .",
    "because of the above properties it holds that , for each @xmath281 and @xmath282 , the functions @xmath283 constitute an onb for the scaling space @xmath277",
    ". one can also show that from the existence of the scaling function it follows that there exists a so - called _ generating wavelet ( or mother wavelet ) _",
    "@xmath284 such that , for each @xmath281 and @xmath282 , the functions @xmath285 constitute an onb for the spaces @xmath278 .",
    "hence , we have that , for every @xmath266 , the following mappings are bijections : @xmath286    the above constructions provide the following decompositions of the signal space @xmath269 into the sum of the scaling spaces @xmath287 and the wavelet spaces @xmath288 , or into a sum of only wavelet spaces : @xmath289 from these decomposition we immediately get the following decompositions of signals @xmath290 : @xmath291 the coefficients of the above decomposition are called the _ wavelet and scaling coefficients of @xmath33 _ , respectively , and the corresponding mapping that maps @xmath33 to those coefficients is called the _ wavelet transform of @xmath33_. a detailed construction of orthogonal ( and biorthogonal ) wavelet systems together with many interesting details may be found , for example , in  @xcite .      wavelet bases in higher dimensions",
    "can be defined by taking tensor products of the one - dimensional wavelet and scaling functions . as a concrete example consider @xmath292 and let @xmath293 be the generating wavelet and scaling functions ,",
    "respectively . then , an orthogonal wavelet basis of @xmath294 is defined by translates and scaled versions of the ( tensor product ) functions @xmath295 the corresponding scaling functions at scale @xmath266 of two variables are defined as translated and scaled versions of @xmath296    analogously to the above construction in two dimensions , one can define a wavelet onb in @xmath51 by a tensor product construction . in this case",
    "we get @xmath297 different generating wavelets @xmath298 and one generating scaling function @xmath299 . therefore , a wavelet onb in @xmath51 is system @xmath300 in @xmath50 , where the index @xmath301 consists of three parameters , the scale index @xmath302 , the location index @xmath303 , and the orientation index @xmath304 .",
    "the wavelet basis elements are again defined as dilates and translates of the generating wavelets @xmath305 : @xmath306 if we also add the index set @xmath307 and consider the scaling functions defined by @xmath308 the we get similar decompositions to the one - dimensional case : @xmath309        orthonormal wavelet bases can be used to characterize smoothness of functions in terms of the decay properties of wavelet coefficients . in particular , wavelets provide a convenient and a numerically efficient way to characterize besov spaces and calculate besov smoothness of functions , see @xcite . skipping the details , we here only mention that the besov spaces @xmath314 can be defined by the condition , that the besov norm @xmath315{\\sum_{j\\in{\\mathbb{n } } } 2^{jsq } \\ , { \\left\\lvert { \\mathcal w}{f}{\\left(j,{\\,\\cdot\\,}\\right)}\\right\\rvert}_{\\ell^p}^q } \\qquad \\text { with } \\quad s = r +   \\frac{d}{2 } - \\frac{d}{p }   \\,,\\ ] ] is well defined and finite .",
    "we note that , the given definition of @xmath316 is an equivalent norm to the classical definition of besov norms .",
    "the above characterization holds as long as the generating wavelet has @xmath317 vanishing moments and is @xmath318-times continuously differentiable .    in section [ sec : noisy ] , we use the above characterization of besov norms in terms of wavelet coefficients in order to evaluate the performance of our method for functions that lie in balls of besov spaces @xmath314 for some given norm parameters @xmath319 , @xmath320 and smoothness parameter @xmath321 .",
