    "discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods are high - order finite element discretizations which were introduced in the early 1970s for the numerical simulation of the first - order hyperbolic neutron transport equation @xcite . in recent years , these methods have become very popular for the solution of nonlinear convection dominated flow problems @xcite .",
    "these methods allow high - order of accuracy and locality , which make them well suited to parallel computing , @xmath0-refinement , @xmath0-multigrid , unstructured meshes , application of boundary conditions , etc .",
    "however , the dg method suffers from spurious oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities that develop in solutions of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws .",
    "these oscillations are due to the gibbs phenomenon @xcite and may cause the solution to become locally nonphysical leading to robustness issues for the computation .",
    "quadrature rules are usually used to compute integrals in the discretization of the equations .",
    "properties of the dg method therefore depend on the local structure of the numerical solution at faces and within elements of the mesh .",
    "the control of such oscillations at a reasonable cost while keeping accuracy , robustness and stability is essential for the efficiency of the dg method and remains a challenge .",
    "strategies have been proposed such as limiters @xcite , non - oscillatory reconstructions @xcite , @xmath0-adaptation @xcite , shock capturing techniques @xcite , etc .",
    "the latter methods aim at adding artificial viscosity to spread the structure of the discontinuity so that it can be resolved at the discrete level . for a dg method with polynomials of degree @xmath1 and cells of size @xmath2 ,",
    "the resolution scale is @xmath3 thus meaning that the method should resolve the discontinuity inside the element @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the numerical solution inside the discretization elements is therefore important for understanding the convergence of the dg computations .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the dg method for scalar nonlinear conservation laws which present stationary discontinuous solutions .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in the behavior of discrete profiles near shocks .",
    "jennings @xcite studied the approximation of scalar equations by monotone conservative finite difference schemes and proved the existence and stability of traveling discrete shocks .",
    "discrete profiles for scalar equations were also studied in @xcite .",
    "the analysis was then extended to systems in @xcite .",
    "bultelle et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the linear stability of steady shock profiles obtained for general systems of conservation laws discretized with the godunov method and constructed unstable profiles in the case of the euler equations for gas dynamics .",
    "recently , lerat @xcite found exact discrete shock solutions for residual - based compact schemes @xcite up to seventh - order of accuracy discretizing the inviscid burgers equation .",
    "solutions were derived explicitly and were parametrized by the relative position of the shock in the discretization cell . such analysis may help to tune parameters of the numerical method . in the context of dg methods , cockburn and",
    "guzmn @xcite considered a formally second order approximation of a scalar linear hyperbolic equation with discontinuous initial condition .",
    "they gave estimates of the size of extent of oscillations upstream and downstream of the discontinuity based on suitable weights introduced in @xcite .",
    "recently , their work was extended to arbitrary approximation order in space and a third - order runge - kutta method on non - uniform meshes @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath4-singularities in initial condition and source term of a scalar hyperbolic equation was then investigated in @xcite where superconvergence in negative - order norms outside the pollution region was proved and sharp estimates over the whole domain were given .",
    "the objective of this work is the theoretical analysis of stationary discrete shock solutions for the dg method discretizing a scalar conservation law with a general convex flux .",
    "we will mainly consider the godunov method to evaluate the numerical flux for which explicit solutions can be derived , but we will also focus on other numerical fluxes widely used in the context of dg methods . to this end , we first give general results about the structure of the stationary discrete profiles .",
    "these results are local in the sense that they consider profiles that are small perturbations to the exact solution . in the case of the godunov flux ,",
    "we establish the mean value of the solution in the cell containing the exact shock position and the complete solution in other cells for an arbitrary approximation order .",
    "the analysis also predicts exponential decay of oscillations of the discrete profile on both sides of the shock for a certain class of monotone numerical fluxes .",
    "then , the linear stability of these profiles is investigated and eigenvalues are characterized for the godunov flux . as a result , the shock profiles may become unstable at points where the numerical flux is not differentiable .",
    "these points contain the situation of a shock at interface which is counter - intuitive since the exact solution is a piecewise constant function over all cells and is included in the function space of the dg method .",
    "considering the inviscid burgers equation we derive exact discrete shock profiles for the dg scheme up to fourth - order of accuracy in the spirit of the work of lerat @xcite .",
    "the results allow to evaluate quantitatively the structure of the solution within elements and predict situations where the numerical solution violates locally an entropy condition at the cell level .",
    "the theoretical stability analysis predicts the occurrence of unstable profiles when the exact shock position is close enough to an interface of the mesh .",
    "numerical experiments will suggest that many features of the dg method obtained with the godunov flux still hold for other numerical fluxes .",
    "in particular , for a given space discretization , the oscillating and unstable characters of the solution depend on the strength and exact position of the shock . as this latter feature is generally unknown",
    ", it strongly complicates the analysis for enhancing stability and robustness of the dg method .",
    "these results may support approaches based on _ a posteriori _ limitation techniques such as the mood method @xcite .",
    "artificial viscosity represent another attractive approach providing that the amount of viscosity adapts itself to the regularity of the solution .",
    "theoretical results in this work will suggest the addition of artificial viscosity to the highest modes in the dg space spanned by hierarchical basis functions . as an illustration",
    ", we apply the spectral vanishing viscosity method @xcite with a selective filter in the legendre basis as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of stationary discrete shock profiles for a discontinuous galerkin method approximating scalar nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws with a convex flux . using the godunov method for the numerical flux , </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the steady state solutions for arbitrary approximation orders and show that they are oscillatory only in one mesh cell and are parametrized by the shock strength and its relative position in the cell . in the particular case of the inviscid burgers equation </S>",
    "<S> , we derive analytical solutions of the numerical scheme and predict their oscillations up to fourth - order of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a linear stability analysis shows that these profiles may become unstable at points where the godunov flux is not differentiable . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical and numerical investigations show that these results can be extended to other numerical fluxes . in particular , shock profiles </S>",
    "<S> are found to vanish exponentially fast from the shock position for some class of monotone numerical fluxes and the oscillatory and unstable characters of their solutions present strong similarities with that of the godunov method .    </S>",
