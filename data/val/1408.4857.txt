    ". therefore , the high temperatures reached by the gas in the passage of the shock does not enhance the production of formamide .",
    "we conclude that even when taking account the sputtering of dust grain mantles in shocks , the formation pathway from formaldehyde and amidogen fails to account for the abundance of formamide in b1 and b2 .",

    "<S> interstellar molecules with a peptide link -nh - c(=o)- , like formamide ( nh@xmath0cho ) , acetamide ( nh@xmath0coch@xmath1 ) and isocyanic acid ( hnco ) are particularly interesting for their potential role in pre - biotic chemistry . </S>",
