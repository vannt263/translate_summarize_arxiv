    "recent experimental realizations of atom optical devices such as atomic waveguides , beamsplitters @xcite , on - chip bec sources and conveyor belts @xcite opens a way for development of more complex devices such as , e.g. , bec - based interferometers @xcite . on - chip integrated cold atom circuits capable of complex functionality can be constructed from simpler building blocks as it is done in microelectronics to find applications in fundamental physics , precision measurements and quantum information technology .",
    "one of the most important components of a microelectronic circuit is a transistor . in this paper",
    "we present a bec - based device which will be subsequently called a bec transistor or an atom transistor .",
    "it enables one to control a large number of atoms with a smaller number of atoms and demonstrates switching and both differential and absolute gain thus showing behavior similar to that of an electronic transistor . the device is not optimized for performance but is arguably the simplest possible geometry showing behavior reminiscent of a transistor .",
    "this makes its experimental realization relatively easy with existing atom chip techniques .",
    "the bec transistor uses a bose einstein condensate in a triple well potential , as shown schematically in fig [ fig : toon ] .",
    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : toon ] refers to two subtly different possible experimental realization of the device . in the trapped configuration ,",
    "the bec is confined in all three dimensions in the potential wells .",
    "the wells are allowed to interact for time interval @xmath0 .",
    "this is done either spatially bringing them together and separating apart after time @xmath0 of changing the shapes of the potential wells so that the interaction is suppressed after time @xmath0 . in the waveguide configuration , the potential wells of fig .",
    "[ fig : toon ] represent three guides that converge , run parallel to each other for distance @xmath1 and then diverge .",
    "the interaction time @xmath2 in this geometry is determined by the speed of flow @xmath3 of the bec in the guides . in the following for definiteness we will use the terminology appropriate for the trapped configuration .",
    "the bec transistor is similar to an electronic field effect transistor .",
    "the left well behaves like the source , the middle as the gate , and the right well is equivalent to the drain . if there are no atoms in the middle well , practically no atoms tunnel from the left into the right well , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toon]a .",
    "a small number of atoms placed into the middle well switches the device resulting into the strong flux of atoms from the left well ( the source ) through the middle and into the right well as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toon]b .",
    "increasing number of atoms in the middle well increases the number of atoms that tunnel into the right well .",
    "parameters of the triple well structure are chosen so that the number of atoms having tunneled into the right well at the end of the interaction period is much larger that the number of atoms in the middle well .",
    "in the subsequent sections we will show that the bec transistor exhibits both absolute and differential gain .    the physics of operation of the bec transistor is based on atom - atom interactions and appropriate design of the potentials .",
    "the chemical potential of the left well is chosen to be nearly equal to the ground state energy level of the empty right well ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : toon ] we make them equal ) .",
    "the ground state energy of the empty middle well is chosen to be considerably lower than that in both the left and the right wells . placing atoms in a well",
    "raises the value of chemical potential due to atom - atom interactions .",
    "parameters of the potential wells are chosen so that the chemical potential in the middle well is considerably more sensitive to the change in the number of atoms in the well than is the case for the left and right wells .",
    "when the middle and right wells are initially unpopulated , tunneling of atoms from the left to the middle well is blocked because of the energy mismatch as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toon]c .",
    "if some amount of atoms is placed into the middle well , the atom - atom interactions will increase the energy of the atoms in the middle well . when the chemical potential in the middle well becomes nearly equal to that in the left and right wells , the device switches and atoms become able to tunnel from the left through the middle into the right well as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toon]d .    using atom - atom interactions to block tunneling in a double - well structure",
    "is often referred to as self trapping .",
    "this effect was first described in ref .",
    "if a condensate is placed in one of the two weakly - coupled spatially separated potential wells with matched energy levels , it can oscillate between the wells by linear quantum tunneling .",
    "however , due to atom - atom interactions , the tunneling is blocked when the number of atoms in the condensate exceeds some critical value .",
    "this suppression is due to the fact that interactions increase chemical potential of the atoms in the occupied wells and introduce nonlinear energy mismatch .",
    "self trapping has been analyzed for a large number of systems including asymmetric double well potentials @xcite and symmetric three well systems @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed experimentally for atoms in a one dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the quantum state of two trapped bose - einstein condensates in a double well potential has been analyzed in ref .",
    "it has been shown that when the two wells are separated and the interaction between the atoms is repulsive , the lowest energy state is fragmented , which means that the coherence between the atoms in each well is lost .",
    "the dependence of this fragmentation on the splitting rate and physical parameters of the potential has been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the visibility of interference fringes after splitting of a condensate with both attractive and repulsive interactions was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , who showed a decrease in quantum noise in the case of attractive interactions .",
    "the quantum dynamics of atoms in a symmetric double well potential , where the atoms are in an initially fragmented state was also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "bose einstein condensates in triple well structures have been analyzed and the stationary solutions in the mean field approximation were found in ref .",
    "three well systems show chaotic solutions @xcite and the dynamics of atoms in a three well potential is sensitive to the initial conditions of the system @xcite .",
    "this means that one can control the dynamics of the system not only by varying the physical parameters of the potential , but also by changing the initial conditions .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a single atom transistor in a 1d optical lattice .",
    "a quantum interference phenomenon is used to switch the flux of atoms in a lattice through a cite containing a single impurity atom .",
    "finally , ref .",
    "@xcite discusses  atomtronic \" diodes and transistors which are direct analogs of their electronic counterparts .",
    "these devices use cold atoms in an optical lattice instead of electrons in a crystal . with the addition of impurities",
    "both n type and p type `` semiconductors '' may be constructed .",
    "a bipolar junction transistor could be then built with a npn or pnp sandwich .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "when the number of atoms in the middle well is small , tunneling from the left into the right well is negligible ( a ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the chemical potential of the middle well does not match that of the two other wells ( c ) .",
    "placing atoms in the middle well increases the chemical potential due to interatomic interactions ( d ) and enables tunneling then atoms tunnel from the left into the right well .",
