    "the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) @xcite observations provide the first evidence for the accelerating expansion of the present universe . to explain this accelerated expansion ,",
    "the universe at present time is viewed as being dominated by an exotic component with large negative pressure referred to as dark energy .",
    "a combined analysis of cosmological observations , in particular , of the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) experiment @xcite , indicates that dark energy occupies about 2/3 of the total energy of the universe , and dark matter about 1/3 .",
    "the most obvious theoretical candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath7 @xcite which has the equation of state @xmath9 .",
    "an alternative proposal is the dynamical dark energy @xcite which suggests that the energy form with negative pressure is provided by a scalar field evolving down a proper potential .",
    "the feature of this class of models is that the equation of state of dark energy @xmath10 evolves dynamically during the expansion of the universe .",
    "however , as is well known , there are two difficulties arise from all these scenarios , namely the two dark energy ( or cosmological constant ) problems  the fine - tuning problem and the `` cosmic coincidence '' problem .",
    "the fine - tuning problem asks why the dark energy density today is so small compared to typical particle scales .",
    "the dark energy density is of order @xmath11 , which appears to require the introduction of a new mass scale 14 or so orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale .",
    "the second difficulty , the cosmic coincidence problem , states `` since the energy densities of dark energy and dark matter scale so differently during the expansion of the universe , why are they nearly equal today '' ? to get this coincidence , it appears that their ratio must be set to a specific , infinitesimal value in the very early universe .",
    "recently , considerable interest has been stimulated in explaining the observed dark energy by the holographic dark energy model .",
    "for an effective field theory in a box of size @xmath12 , with uv cut - off @xmath13 the entropy @xmath14 scales extensively , @xmath15 .",
    "however , the peculiar thermodynamics of black hole @xcite has led bekenstein to postulate that the maximum entropy in a box of volume @xmath16 behaves nonextensively , growing only as the area of the box , i.e. there is a so - called bekenstein entropy bound , @xmath17 .",
    "this nonextensive scaling suggests that quantum field theory breaks down in large volume . to reconcile this breakdown with the success of local quantum field theory in describing observed particle phenomenology , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a more restrictive bound  the energy bound .",
    "they pointed out that in quantum field theory a short distance ( uv ) cut - off is related to a long distance ( ir ) cut - off due to the limit set by forming a black hole . in the other words , if the quantum zero - point energy density @xmath18 is relevant to a uv cut - off , the total energy of the whole system with size @xmath12 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus we have @xmath19 , this means that the maximum entropy is in order of @xmath20 .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle @xcite is viewed as dark energy , usually dubbed holographic dark energy . the largest ir cut - off @xmath12",
    "is chosen by saturating the inequality so that we get the holographic dark energy density @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a numerical constant , and @xmath23 is the reduced planck mass . if we take @xmath12 as the size of the current universe , for instance the hubble scale @xmath24 , then the dark energy density will be close to the observed data .",
    "however , hsu @xcite pointed out that this yields a wrong equation of state for dark energy .",
    "li @xcite subsequently proposed that the ir cut - off @xmath12 should be taken as the size of the future event horizon @xmath25 then the problem can be solved nicely and the holographic dark energy model can thus be constructed successfully .",
    "some speculations on the deep reasons of the holographic dark energy were considered by several authors @xcite ; further studies on this model see also @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to discuss about the choice @xmath26 . even though this choice was argued to be unsuitable due to that it may lead to the holographic dark energy tracks the matter density",
    ", this does not mean that the formalism @xmath27 can not be made compatible with the observation .",
    "there are other contexts in quantum field theory where one can have a dark energy behaving as @xmath27 without introducing the holographic principle .",
    "for instance , refs.@xcite nicely introduce the @xmath27 law from general arguments in quantum field theory .",
    "actually , the first time where this law was introduced in quantum field theory was in the context of the renormalization group models of the cosmological constant ; see e.g. @xcite . otherwise , within the holographic model framework",
    ", the choice @xmath26 can also be favored , if one introduce some interaction between dark energy and dark matter @xcite . however , in this paper we restrict our attention to the holographic dark energy model proposed by li @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will see what constraints to the holographic dark energy model are set by present and future sne ia observations .",
    "recently , some constraints from sne ia on related model where obtained in refs.@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis carried out in ref.@xcite .",
    "the work presented here differs from @xcite ( and @xcite ) in the following aspects : ( a ) we not only constrain the model by means of the sne ia observations , but also test the fit results by using the age of the universe ; ( b ) when performing the analysis of the sne data , we also test the sensitivity to the present hubble parameter @xmath28 in the fit ; ( c ) for improving the fit result , we combine the current sne ia data with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data and the large - scale structure ( lss ) data to analyze the model ; ( d ) we also investigate the predicted constraints on the model from future sne ia observations .",
    "the holographic dark energy scenario may provide simultaneously natural solutions to both dark energy problems as demonstrated in ref.@xcite . in",
    "what follows we will review this model briefly and then constrain it by the type ia supernova observations .",
    "in addition , we will also apply a joint analysis of sne+cmb+lss data to this model .",
    "consider now a spatially flat frw ( friedmann - robertson - walker ) universe with matter component @xmath29 ( including both baryon matter and cold dark matter ) and holographic dark energy component @xmath18 , the friedmann equation reads @xmath30 or equivalently , @xmath31 note that we always assume spatial flatness throughout this paper as motivated by inflation . combining the definition of the holographic dark energy ( [ de ] ) and the definition of the future event horizon ( [ eh ] ) , we derive @xmath32 we notice that the friedmann equation implies @xmath33 substituting ( [ fri ] ) into ( [ rh ] ) , one obtains the following equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 . then taking derivative with respect to @xmath36 in both sides of the above relation , we get easily the dynamics satisfied by the dark energy , i.e. the differential equation about the fractional density of dark energy , @xmath37 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "this equation describes the behavior of the holographic dark energy completely , and it can be solved exactly @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 can be determined through ( [ solution ] ) by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath41 as @xmath42 . from the energy conservation equation of the dark energy , the equation of state of the dark energy can be expressed as @xmath43 then making use of the formula @xmath44 and the differential equation of @xmath40 ( [ deq ] ) , the equation of state for the holographic dark energy can be given @xcite @xmath45 we can also give the deceleration parameter @xmath46 , in terms of @xmath40 , @xmath47 it can be seen clearly that the equation of state of the holographic dark energy evolves dynamically and satisfies @xmath48 due to @xmath49 . in this sense , this model should be attributed to the class of dynamical dark energy models even though without quintessence scalar field .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 plays a significant role in this model .",
    "if one takes @xmath50 , the behavior of the holographic dark energy will be more and more like a cosmological constant with the expansion of the universe , and the ultimate fate of the universe will be entering the de sitter phase in the far future .",
    "as is shown in ref.@xcite , if one puts the parameter @xmath51 into ( [ w ] ) , then a definite prediction of this model , @xmath52 , will be given .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath0 , the holographic dark energy will behave like a quintom - type dark energy proposed recently in ref.@xcite , the amazing feature of which is that the equation of state of dark energy component @xmath10 crosses the phantom divide line , @xmath53 , i.e. it is larger than @xmath53 in the past while less then @xmath53 near today .",
    "the recent fits to current sne ia data with parametrization of the equation of state of dark energy find that the quintom - type dark energy is mildly favored @xcite .",
    "usually the quintom dark energy model is realized in terms of double scalar fields , one is a normal scalar field and the other is a phantom - type scalar field @xcite .",
    "however , the holographic dark energy in the case @xmath0 provides us with a more natural realization for the quintom picture . while , if @xmath54 , the equation of state of dark energy will be always larger than @xmath53 such that the universe avoids entering the de sitter phase and the big rip phase . hence , we see explicitly , the determination of the value of @xmath22 is a key point to the feature of the holographic dark energy as well as the ultimate fate of the universe .    .8 cm    as an illustrative example , we plot in fig.1 the evolutions of the deceleration parameter @xmath55 and the equation of state of dark energy @xmath10 in cases of @xmath56 and 0.6 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that the equation of state of dark energy crosses @xmath53 as @xmath0 , which is in accordance with the plots of the model - independent analysis in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the variable cosmological constant model can also give rise to a quintom behavior , i.e. the effective equation of state produced by this model can also cross @xmath53 @xcite .    in the forthcoming sections ,",
    "we will see what constraints to the model described above are set by present and future sne ia observations . in the fitting , we use the recent new high red - shift supernova observations from the hst / goods program and previous supernova data , and furthermore we test the fit results by means of the cosmic age data . we find that if we marginalize the nuisance parameter @xmath57 , the fit of the sne observation provides @xmath58 ; this means the holographic dark energy behaves as a quintom .",
    "further , we find that the allowed range of model parameters depends on @xmath57 evidently , for instance , we obtain ( in @xmath59 ) @xmath60 for @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for @xmath65 . the allowed regions of model parameters become evidently smaller for larger values of @xmath57 .",
    "the fit values of the matter density @xmath66 in this model are apparently larger than the fit value appears in the @xmath7cdm ( wmap result ) .",
    "now that the sne data analysis evidently depends on the value of @xmath57 , an important thing we should do is to find some observational quantities which do not depend on @xmath57 to be useful complements of the sne data set to probe the property of holographic dark energy .",
    "such quantities can be found in cmb and lss ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , see section iv ) .",
    "a combined analysis of sne+cmb+lss shows that the confidence region evidently shrinks , and the value of @xmath22 is changed considerably , namely in @xmath59 , @xmath69 .",
    "we will discuss the cosmological consequences come from the fits , and compare the case of the joint analysis with the case of the sne only in detail .",
    "interestingly , an expected snap simulation using @xmath7cdm as a fiducial model shows that the holographic dark energy model will also favor @xmath0 even though the universe is indeed dominated by a cosmological constant .",
    "we now perform the best fit analysis on our holographic dark energy model with data of the type ia supernova observations .",
    "the luminosity distance of a light source is defined in such a way as to generalize to an expanding and curved space the inverse - square law of brightness valid in a static euclidean space , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the absolute luminosity which is a known value for the standard candle sne ia , @xmath72 is the measured flux , @xmath73 ( here we use the natural unit , namely the speed of light is defined to be 1 ) represents the hubble distance with value @xmath74 mpc , and @xmath75 can be obtained from ( [ feq ] ) , expressed as @xmath76 note that the dynamical behavior of @xmath40 is determined by ( [ deq ] ) .",
    "the observations directly measure the apparent magnitude @xmath77 of a supernova and its red - shift @xmath78 . the apparent magnitude @xmath77 is related to the luminosity distance @xmath79 of the supernova through @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the absolute magnitude which is believed to be constant for all type ia supernovae .",
    "the numerical parameter @xmath22 of the model , the density parameter @xmath66 and the nuisance parameter @xmath57 can be determined by minimizing @xmath82 ^ 2\\over \\sigma_i^2}~,\\label{chisn}\\ ] ] where the extinction - corrected distance moduli @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the total uncertainty in the observation .",
    "the likelihood @xmath86 if the measurement errors are gaussian . in our analysis",
    ", we take the 157 gold data points listed in riess et al .",
    "@xcite which includes recent new 14 high redshift sne ( gold ) data from the hst / goods program .",
    "the results of our analysis for the holographic dark energy model are displayed in fig.2 . in this figure",
    "we marginalize over the nuisance parameter @xmath57 and show @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 confidence level contours , in the @xmath90-plane .",
    "the best fit values for the model parameters are : @xmath63 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 with @xmath93 ( similar results see also @xcite ) .",
    "we see clearly that the fit values of this model are evidently different from those of @xmath7cdm , i.e. the value of @xmath57 is slightly smaller and @xmath66 evidently larger ( the wmap results for @xmath7cdm model are @xcite : @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "we notice in this figure that the current sne ia data do not strongly constrain the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath22 ( in @xmath96 ) , in particular @xmath22 , in the considered ranges .",
    "other observations may impose further constraints .",
    "for instance , the cmb and lss data can provide us with useful complements to the sne data for constraining cosmological models .",
    "but , first , we will apply a cosmic age test to the sne analysis .",
    ".8 cm    recent analyses of the age of old stars @xcite indicate that the expansion time is in the range @xmath97 at @xmath88 confidence , with a central value @xmath98 . following krauss and chaboyer",
    "@xcite these numbers add 0.8 gyr to the star ages , under the assumption that star formation commenced no earlier than @xmath99 .",
    "a naive addition in quadrature to the uncertainty in @xmath28 indicates that the dimensionless age parameter is in the range @xmath100 at @xmath88 confidence , with a central value @xmath101 .",
    "more recent , richer et al .",
    "@xcite and hansen et al .",
    "@xcite found an age of @xmath102 gyr at @xmath88 confidence using the white dwarf cooling sequence method .",
    "for a full review of cosmic age see ref",
    "all in all , it seems reasonable to view @xmath103 gyr to be a low limit of the cosmic age @xcite .",
    "now let us examine the age computation of the holographic dark energy model .",
    "the age of the universe can be written as @xmath104 where @xmath73 represents the hubble time with value @xmath105 gyr . using the best fit values",
    ", the holographic dark energy model gives the cosmic age @xmath106 gyr .",
    "this value is consistent with the above observational analyses .",
    "furthermore , we impose a more rigorous test on it .",
    "the latest value of cosmic age appears in the review of particle physics ( pdg ) @xcite is given by a combined analysis of various observations @xcite , @xmath107 . using the data from ref.@xcite",
    ", we can get the dimensionless age parameter range @xmath108 at @xmath87 confidence , with a central value @xmath109 .",
    "we also display the contours @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( @xmath59 ) in fig.2 .",
    "it can be seen explicitly that the @xmath59 fit result of the sne ia data is almost excluded by this age test .",
    ".8 cm    .8 cm",
    ".8 cm    next , we will probe the sensitivity to the present hubble parameter @xmath28 in the analysis of the sne data .",
    "we check that , keeping the parameter @xmath57 fixed , how well the sne and the cosmic age will constrain the holographic dark energy model .",
    "we fix @xmath112 and 0.71 , respectively , and show the fit results in figs.3 - 5 . from these figures",
    ", we notice that with the increase of the parameter @xmath57 , @xmath22 decreases evidently and the confidence contours in the @xmath113-plane shrink sharply .",
    "these figures clearly show that the sne analysis is dependent on the parameter @xmath57 highly .",
    "hence , finding out observational quantities which do not depend on @xmath28 to jointly constrain the holographic dark energy model becomes very important and senseful .",
    "we also display age contours in these figures , but the age constraints are rather weak .",
    "the fits of sne data indicate that the current sne ia data tend to support a holographic dark energy with @xmath0 , in other words , a quintom - type holographic dark energy . however , the authors of ref.@xcite tried to show another possibility .",
    "they re - examined the holographic dark energy model by considering the spatial curvature , and found that the holographic dark energy will not behave as phantom if the universe is closed . however , the spatial flatness is a definitive prediction of the inflationary cosmology , and has been confirmed precisely by the wmap .",
    "thus we use the spatial flatness prior throughout this paper .",
    "the above analyses show that the supernovae data alone seem not sufficient to constrain the holographic dark energy model strictly .",
    "first , the confidence region of @xmath114 plane is rather large , especially for the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the best fit value of @xmath66 is evidently larger .",
    "second , it is very hard to understand the fit value of parameter @xmath22 , 0.21 , it seems odd because it leads to an unreasonable present equation of state , @xmath115 , the absolute value is too large .",
    "third , even though the predicted cosmic age @xmath106 gyr is larger than the reasonable low limit of the cosmic age estimated by old stars , a more rigorous analysis implies that the fit result of the sne ia data is contradictive to the present data of cosmic age ( dimensionless age parameter @xmath116 ) .",
    "furthermore , our analysis shows that the fit of the sne ia data is very sensitive to the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "hence , it is very important to find other observational quantities irrelevant to @xmath28 as complement to sne ia data .",
    "fortunately , such suitable data can be found in the probes of cmb and lss .    in what follows",
    "we will perform a combined analysis of sne ia , cmb , and lss on the constraints of the holographic dark energy model .",
    "we use a @xmath117 statistic @xmath118 where @xmath119 is given by equation ( [ chisn ] ) for sne ia statistics , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are contributions from cmb and lss data , respectively . for the cmb ,",
    "we use only the measurement of the cmb shift parameter @xcite , @xmath122 where @xmath123 @xcite . note that this quantity is irrelevant to the parameter @xmath28 such that provides robust constraint on the dark energy model .",
    "the results from cmb data correspond to @xmath124 ( given by wmap , cbi , acbar ) @xcite .",
    "we include the cmb data in our analysis by adding @xmath125 ^ 2 $ ] ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath67 is computed by the holographic dark energy model using equation ( [ r ] ) .",
    "the only large scale structure information we use is the parameter @xmath68 measured by sdss @xcite , defined by @xmath126^{2/3}~,\\label{a}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 . also , we find that this quantity is independent of @xmath28 either , thus can provide another robust constraint on the model .",
    "the sdss gives the measurement data @xcite @xmath128 .",
    "we also include the lss constraints in our analysis by adding @xmath129 ^ 2 $ ] ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath68 is computed by the holographic dark energy model using equation ( [ a ] ) .",
    "note that we have chosen to use only the most conservative and robust information , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , from cmb and lss observations .",
    "these measurements we use do not depend on the hubble parameter @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , by limiting the amount of information that we use from cmb and lss observations to complement the sne ia data , we minimize the effect of the systematics inherent in the cmb and lss data on our results .",
    "figure 6 shows our main results , the contours of @xmath59 , @xmath96 , and @xmath130 confidence levels in the @xmath114 plane .",
    "the best fit values for the model parameters are : @xmath4 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , with @xmath133 .",
    "we see clearly that a great progress has been made when we perform a joint analysis of sne ia , cmb , and lss data .",
    "note that the best fit value of c is also less than 1 , while in @xmath59 range it can slightly larger than 1 .",
    "now the fit value of @xmath66 is roughly as the same as that of the @xmath7cdm model ( wmap result ) , but @xmath57 is still slightly smaller . it should be pointed out that a slightly lower value of @xmath57 is , however , in agreement with the observations of @xcite which can accommodate lower values of @xmath134 .",
    "we also see from the figure that the fit result of the joint analysis is consistent with the dimensionless age range @xmath135 .    .8 cm    we now compare the fit results of the sne analysis and the joint analysis of sne , cmb , and lss , and discuss the different cosmological consequences .",
    "let us first look at the likelihood distributions of the parameter @xmath22 in the two fits .",
    "in fig.7 we plot the 1-dimensional likelihood function for @xmath22 , marginalizing over the other parameters .",
    "the big difference can lead to rather different conclusions for some important cosmological parameters , such as today s equation - of - state parameter of dark energy , today s deceleration parameter , etc .",
    "for the best fit results of the two fits , we plot the evolution behaviors of the deceleration parameter @xmath55 and the equation - of - state parameter of dark energy @xmath10 in fig.8 . for the sne+cmb+lss joint analysis , from the figure",
    ", we see that the deceleration parameter @xmath55 has a value of @xmath136 at present .",
    "the transition from deceleration to acceleration ( @xmath137 ) occurs at a redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "the equation - of - state parameter @xmath10 is slightly smaller than @xmath53 at present , @xmath5 . for comparison ,",
    "we list these values for the alone analysis of sne data : @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath115 . therefore ,",
    "obviously , the results of the combined fit seem more reasonable . from a joint analysis of sne+cmb+lss data",
    ", one may obtain within the framework of the holographic dark energy model a fairly good idea of when the universe began to accelerate and how fast the present acceleration is . by contraries ,",
    "the cosmological consequences given by the alone analysis of the sne data seem unreasonable .",
    "comparing our plots in fig.8 with the model - independent plots in ref.@xcite ( which also use data from @xcite ) , we find that the holographic plot for @xmath2 case is in good agreement with those model - independent plots for the redshift range @xmath140 , while the @xmath1 case dose not accord .",
    "moreover , it should be mentioned again that these results demonstrate that the best fit to sne+cmb+lss observations also favors a quintom - type holographic dark energy .",
    ".8 cm    .8 cm",
    "finally we consider how well the proposed supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) , may constrain the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath66 .",
    "the snap mission is expected to observe about 2000 type ia sne each year , over a period of three years , according to the snap specifications.to find the expected precision of the snap , one must assume a fiducial model , and then simulate the experiment assuming it as a reference model .",
    "we will use snap specifications to construct mock sne catalogues @xcite .",
    "following previous investigations @xcite , we assume , in our monte carlo simulations , that a total of 2000 supernovae ( roughly one year of snap observations ) will be observed with the following redshift distribution .",
    "we consider , 1920 sne ia , distributed in 24 bins , from @xmath42 to @xmath141 . from redshift @xmath141 to @xmath142 , we assume that 60 sne ia will be observed and we divide them in 6 bins .",
    "from @xmath142 to @xmath143 we consider 4 bins with 5 sne ia in each bin .",
    "all the supernovae are assumed to be uniformly distributed with @xmath144 . to fully determine the @xmath117 functions , the error estimates for snap",
    "must be defined .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the systematic errors for the apparent magnitude , @xmath77 , are given by    @xmath145    which are measured in magnitudes such that at @xmath142 the systematic error is @xmath146 mag , while the statistical errors for @xmath77 are estimated to be @xmath147 mag .",
    "we add both kinds of errors quadratically    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is the number of supernovae in the @xmath150 redshift bin with width @xmath151 .",
    "now let us assume a spatial flat @xmath7cdm model as a fiducial model , and analyze the holographic dark energy model fit .",
    "we aim to show if the universe is indeed described by the @xmath7cdm model , how well the the fitting of a holographic dark energy model to be .",

    "the best fit values for the model parameters are : @xmath153 and @xmath8 . from this figure",
    "it is clear that snap mission is able to place rigorous constraints on the holographic dark energy model . on the other hand",
    ", we notice with interest that , even though the dark energy in the universe is exactly described by a cosmological constant @xmath7 , the precision type ia supernova observations will still support a quintom - type holographic dark energy .",
    "in this paper , we investigated constraints on the holographic dark energy model from current and future sn ia observations .",
    "we considered a spatially flat frw universe with matter component and holographic dark energy component .",
    "for the holographic dark energy model , the numerical constant @xmath22 plays a very important role in determining the evolutionary behavior of the space - time as well as the ultimate fate of the universe . in a holographic dark energy dominated universe ,",
    "the case of @xmath50 corresponds to an asymptotic de sitter universe ; the choice of @xmath0 will lead to dark energy behaving as quintom , and in this case , the gibbons - hawking entropy will eventually decrease as the event horizon shrink such that violates the second law of thermodynamics ; while the case of @xmath54 does not violate the second law of thermodynamics , in this situation , the evolution of the corresponding space - time avoids entering de sitter phase and big rip phase .",
    "though the choice of @xmath50 is favored theoretically , other possibilities can not be ruled out from the viewpoint of phenomenology , and only experiments and observations are capable of determining which choice is realistic .",
    "we derived model parameter ranges from the analysis of the present available sne ia data , and then imposed a rigorous test using the new data of age of the universe on the derived parameter region .",

    "we also probe the sensitivity to the present hubble parameter @xmath28 in this analysis .",
    "we do this by fixing the parameter @xmath57 , and find the allowed regions of the parameters shrink sharply as @xmath57 increases .",

    "an expected snap fit , by using the @xmath7cdm model as fiducial model to generate mock observational data , shows that the case @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) also favored .",
    "obviously , a large number of supernovae at high redshifts , as well as better knowledge of the values of @xmath28 and @xmath66 are therefore required to draw firm conclusions about the property of the holographic dark energy .",
    "we expect that a more sophisticated combined analysis of various observations will be capable of determining the value of @xmath22 exactly and thus revealing the property of the holographic dark energy .",
