    "enormous amount of information produced by everyone in their everyday life is characteristic of our modern society . in recent years , there has been a significant change in the pattern of how information is exchanged .",
    "previously information was largely produced by few big entities ( e.g. news sites , entertainment organizations , etc . ) and downloaded by individuals .",
    "more recently , individual users have been transformed into hubs themselves and are now a large source of information ; an always - connected entity .",
    "this changes the structure of the network and increases traffic demands .",
    "additionally new services , in particular video streaming , put an increasing load on today s infrastructure , thus taking it to its limits and forcing us to find a solution to expand the throughput capacity and meet the increasing demand . a large fraction of this load is carried by optical fiber networks , which form the backbone of the internet and other communication networks . as technology",
    "approaches the physical limits of single mode fiber and the capacity reaches its practical limits of the order of @xmath0tbit / s , a capacity crunch is imminent  @xcite .",
    "a candidate technology to avoid such a scenario and to keep up the trend of roughly ten - fold increase in capacity every four years , is space division multiplexing ( sdm )  @xcite .",
    "sdm utilizes space as the final remaining degree of freedom , by tightly packing several spatial channels into a single fiber .",
    "this can be done using multiple cores in multicore fibers ( mcf ) or multiple modes in multimode fibers ( mmf ) . in mmf ,",
    "orthogonal modes are coupled due to fiber imperfections or twisting and bending .",
    "crosstalk between modes can not be avoided in long - haul transmission . in mcf ,",
    "crosstalk levels can be kept sufficiently low to be negligible only for moderate number of cores .",
    "however , it may be beneficial to deliberately introduce crosstalk , as it gives rise to supermodes with higher effective mode area .",
    "this implies a reduced impact of nonlinear impairments and enables higher channel densities .. such fibers also exhibit a sublinear scaling of mode group dispersion with distance  @xcite .",
    "mode scrambling is also introduced by certain types of nearly lossless multiplexers , so - called photonic lanterns  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ xtalk ] illustrates crosstalk in optical fiber .    in all these cases",
    "the original signals have to be disentangled at the receiver .",
    "due to similarities with the wireless channel , the mimo technique has been considered for this purpose .",
    "however , the two channels also exhibit fundamental differences .",
    "for example , the optical channel does not suffer from information loss due to the absence of diffuse scattering .",
    "backscattering is also negligible . due to the low in - fiber power loss , the channel matrix is still unitary , albeit with complex random elements , and the channel matrix is then a gue ( gaussian unitary ensemble ) with dyson index @xmath1 .",
    "previously  @xcite , we considered the outage capacity of the fiber optical mimo channel in the limit of full subchannel mixing and in the absence of mode dependent loss ( mdl ) . in this paper , we move towards a more realistic model of the optical mimo channel by establishing its analogy with a model from mesoscopic physics : the chaotic cavity  @xcite .",
    "this model is amenable to a random matrix theory analysis and can interpolate from zero to strong mixing between subchannels and includes mdl . to showcase its validity",
    "we compute the channel s mutual information via a saddle point analysis .",
    "we give the channel description in section  ii . in section  iii and section",
    "iv we present the mathematical analysis according to random matrix and replica theory and provide our numerical results . finally , in section  v we conclude .",
    "we use upper case letters in bold font to denote matrices , @xmath2 , with entries given by @xmath3 .",
    "the superscript @xmath4 denotes the transpose operation , @xmath5 denotes the conjugate transpose and @xmath6 represents the @xmath7-dimensional identity matrix",
    ".      we deal with integrals over real matrix elements .",
    "we integrate over the elements of an @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 . the corresponding integral measure is denoted by @xmath10",
    "the optical fiber may be viewed as a cavity where optical power may enter and exit from both ends .",
    "the output power @xmath11 is related to the input power @xmath12 through @xmath13 ( see fig .  [ xtalk ] ) with the @xmath14 scattering matrix @xmath15    @xmath16    the @xmath17 and @xmath18 submatrices correspond to the reflected and transmitted signals , respectively .",
    "in contrast to a general cavity , backscattering in the fiber is negligible .",
    "thus we have @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , @xmath20 because the two fiber ends are not distinguishable , therefore a signal entering from the left and propagating to the right experiences the same phenomena as a signal entering from the right end and propagates to the left .",
    "the fiber exhibits random distributed crosstalk between modes or cores .",
    "we assume this mixing to be random over different frequency bands , due to strong delay spread .",
    "the situation is analogous to that of a chaotic cavity , which randomly mixes the cavity states .",
    "the analytic expression of the @xmath21 scattering matrix for a chaotic cavity reads  @xcite : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the @xmath24 channel hamiltonian and @xmath25 is a @xmath26 matrix containing the coupling constants of the fiber to the outside world .",
    "the dimension is @xmath24 as there are @xmath7 incoming states from the left and @xmath7 incoming states from the right , while inside the fiber there are @xmath7 states propagating from left to right and @xmath7 states propagating from right to left .",
    "so in case of perfect ( lossless ) leads , @xmath27 .",
    "the channel hamiltonian is @xmath28 the offdiagonal sub - matrices vanish due to absence of reflection .",
    "@xmath29 are @xmath30 hermitian . because @xmath31 we can write for simplicity @xmath32 . then becomes    @xmath33    but , as @xmath34 , for simplification it is @xmath35 and",
    "finally we have @xmath36 to model the mdl we add the @xmath21 loss matrix @xmath37 @xcite @xmath38 just as for @xmath23 we have @xmath39 . for simplicity we can assume that @xmath40 is a diagonal matrix .    @xmath41    or @xmath42      we wish to compute the capacity of the optical mimo channel .",
    "the mutual information is given by the well - known expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the signal strength , @xmath45 is the complex @xmath46 channel matrix where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the number transmitted and reflected modes .",
    "@xmath50 are @xmath48 and @xmath49 dimensional vectors of the transmitted and received signals , respectively . both are assumed to be zero - mean gaussian .",
    "the maximum of the mutual information over the input distribution yields the capacity of the channel .",
    "the capacity is the maximum error - free information transmission rate when the channel matrix @xmath45 varies through its whole distribution @xmath51 .",
    "we assume @xmath45 to be gaussian distributed .",
    "the @xmath52 matrix @xmath45 is a sub - matrix of the @xmath21 matrix @xmath15 . to extract @xmath45 we use two diagonal @xmath26 matrices @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 which yields @xmath58 so that we can write , @xmath59 to incorporate the idea of a fading channel subject to crosstalk in our analysis , we assume that the channel @xmath60 consists of a random part @xmath61 , plus a deterministic part @xmath62 . thus the final equation becomes @xmath63 here @xmath64 is a parameter controlling the randomness .",
    "@xmath62 is a diagonal matrix and corresponds to the line - of - sight component inside the fiber while the gaussian distributed matrix @xmath61 describes the crosstalk .",
    "in the previous sections we introduces the channel .",
    "next , we will showcase the behavior of the mutual information and we will derive our results .",
    "we start from the mutual information eq .   of an optical mimo channel . by introducing eq .   to eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath65- \\nonumber\\\\ -\\log\\mbox{det}\\left[(\\mathbf{h}_0+\\gamma\\mathbf{g})^2+\\mathbf{\\gamma}^2\\right]\\bigg\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\      = \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\mathcal{i}_1 - \\mathcal{i}_2\\right ] ,      \\label{eq : i }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66\\\\ \\mathcal{i}_2&= & \\log\\mbox{det}\\left[(\\mathbf{h}_0+\\gamma\\mathbf{g})^2+\\mathbf{\\gamma}^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the generating function of , following @xcite , is @xmath67^{-\\nu}\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle e^{-\\nu\\mathcal{i}}\\right\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-\\nu \\langle\\mathcal{i}\\rangle+\\frac{\\nu^2}{2}\\langle \\mathcal{i}^2 \\rangle+\\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so we have @xmath68 we are interested in the mean @xmath69 and the variance @xmath70 of the mutual information",
    ". therefore we have to calculate the mean value of both @xmath71 and @xmath72 and also their respective variances and their covariance . in order to set ourselves either to @xmath73- or @xmath74-space , we set @xmath75 or @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath77 and @xmath78 limits in the evaluation of @xmath79 can be interchanged by first taking the former and then the latter without changing the final answer",
    ". indeed , the two limits of large number of propagating modes and small @xmath80 are not different from each other .",
    "higher terms in the @xmath80 expansion lead to higher terms in the @xmath81 expansion",
    ".      using identity [ iden:1 ] ( appendix  [ ids ] ) , we can write @xmath83^{-\\nu _ 1}\\right\\rangle $ ] , as    @xmath84    using identity  [ iden:2 ] setting @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we write @xmath87 all - together we obtain @xmath88 the ensemble average over channel realization for an arbitrary function is @xmath89 the last exponential can be written as @xmath90 in order to evaluate the first term of we will use identity [ iden:3 ] and introduce @xmath91 matrices @xmath92 : @xmath93 the evaluation of the quadratic parts of the exponential is more tricky . this time we will introduce @xmath91 matrices @xmath94",
    "we have @xmath95    [ [ saddle - point - analysis ] ] saddle - point analysis + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    so , bringing everything together , we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 to consider the vicinity near the saddle - point we rewrite @xmath98 as    @xmath99    where @xmath100 are @xmath101 matrices which represent deviations around the saddle point .    that way",
    ", we can use the taylor expansion for @xmath102 of as : @xmath103 with @xmath104.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    continuing the evaluation of the next term of the taylor expansion , since we are looking for saddle point solution , @xmath102 must be stationary with respect to variations in @xmath98 .",
    "therefore @xmath105 and the corresponding saddle - point equations are :    @xmath106    and the second order term is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a @xmath109 hessian matrix the entries of which can be seen in appendix  [ hessianmatrix ] .",
    "following @xcite , the final outcome for the variance is : @xmath110      for the calculation of the @xmath112 and the corresponding variance , we follow the same method as above but instead of @xmath113 we only have @xmath114 .      again , using identity 1    @xmath116\\mathbf{x}_1 } \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{x}_2^\\dagger\\left [ \\gamma ^2 + \\left ( \\mathbf{h}_0 + \\gamma\\mathbf{g } \\right)^2 \\right]\\mathbf{x}_2\\bigg)\\bigg\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following the previous method we have @xmath117    again , using identity [ iden:2 ] and identity [ iden:3 ] we introduce the ever - helpful @xmath118 matrices @xmath119 , @xmath120 matrices @xmath121 and @xmath122 matrices @xmath123 and following the diagonalizing method we end up to matrix @xmath124 which can be seen in appendix  [ amatrix ] .    at the saddle",
    "point the cross - terms @xmath125 etc are equal to zero .",
    "so @xmath124 becomes a block - diagonal matrix and the evaluation of the determinant ( identity  [ iden:1 ] ) is just the multiplication of these 2 blocks .",
    "the rest of the calculations for the computation of the covariance is straightforward and the hessian matrix for the covariance can be seen in appendix  [ hessian_cov_matrix ] .",
    "so finally the variance is    @xmath126",
    "in order to check our analytical results we have numerically computed mutual information and its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cdf ] and  [ fig : capacity ] .",
    "we compare the gaussian distribution @xmath127 evaluated using the analytical calculations in this paper with results obtained by averaging over a large number of random matrix realizations for @xmath128 .",
    "remarkably , we find that in both cases , the discrepancy between the different curves is small .",
    "this shows that our analytical results are valid even for the practical relevant case of small number of modes or cores @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a novel channel model for the optical mimo channel by relating it to a chaotic cavity .",
    "this new modeling approach captures the fundamental properties of the optical mimo channel . using tools from random matrix theory and a saddle point analysis ,",
    "we have shown that in the limit of large @xmath7 , the distribution of the mutual information approaches a gaussian .",
    "numerically we find that this method is valid even for low @xmath7 .",
    "this analytic method gives us the means to analyze the statistics of throughput in the fiber optical mimo channel in the presence of arbitrary level of crosstalk and mdl .",
    "the introduced channel model is also amenable to extensions , such as dispersion and nonlinear effects in deterministic and random part respectively .",
    "the proofs for the next identities , can be found in @xcite .",
