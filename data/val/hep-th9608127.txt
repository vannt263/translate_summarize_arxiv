    "string solitons and non - perturbative dynamics of string theory have been a subject of fascination for some time .",
    "remarkable progress has been made recently in the understanding of this subject following the realization that certain solitons in string theory admit explicit description in terms of d - branes @xcite .",
    "these solitons are charged with respect to the ramond - ramond fields @xcite and have been identified as the source of various non - perturbative phenomena .",
    "one of the useful properties of d - branes is the fact that they admit a perturbative description at weak coupling in terms of the open strings attached to them .",
    "these open strings can interact amongst themselves , or interact with closed string degrees of freedom outside .",
    "their dynamics can be described using traditional string perturbation theory with slight modifications .",
    "techniques for studying this kind of physics were developed recently in @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed string scale as the dynamical length scale governing the physics of d - brane fluctuations and rich dynamics on the d - brane world volume .    in this article , we extend the results of @xcite to open strings which have neumann boundary condition on one end and dirichlet boundary condition on the other end ( the nd strings ) .",
    "these strings can exist when several d - branes of differing dimensionality , say , a 1-brane and a 5-brane , are simultaneously present .",
    "there are reasons to be interested in the perturbative dynamics of nd strings .",
    "for instance , bound states of 1-branes and 5-branes have been well studied in the context of black hole entropy counting @xcite .",
    "when both 1-branes and 5-branes are abundant , it is the ( 1,5 ) strings which dominates entropically , and their dynamics is of interest in attempts to continue weak coupling calculations to the strong coupling region @xcite .",
    "the need for calculational techniques for nd strings becomes even more acute when one attempts to study emission and absorption cross sections , as was done in @xcite . for simple d - brane configurations",
    ", one can rely on the dirac - born - infeld action @xcite to teach us how the world volume degrees of freedom on the d - brane couple to the space - time fields . for complicated d - brane",
    "bound states , such as the ones involving multiple 1-branes and 5-branes , no analogous description of the effective coupling is known .",
    "we are therefore forced to perform string theory calculations along the lines of @xcite to deduce the effective coupling and to attempt to reconstruct the generalized dirac - born - infeld action . in this article",
    ", we will develop the techniques necessary to carry out this program .",
    "the first step in the perturbative study of string amplitudes is the construction of vertex operators . when an nd vertex is inserted , boundary conditions on the world sheet change .",
    "the nd vertex operator therefore necessarily contains boundary condition changing operators .",
    "we will show that _ twist fields _ , familiar from previous studies in the ashkin - teller model @xcite , off - shell string dynamics @xcite , and orbifolds @xcite play the necessary role .",
    "we will use these twist fields to construct a vertex operator in conformal gauge which satisfies all the requirements @xcite .",
    "we will find that this vertex operator closely resembles the vertex operator for twisted states in @xmath0 orbifolds of type ii theories @xcite .    in the remainder of the article",
    ", we will use these vertex operators to compute tree - level scattering amplitudes .",
    "we will follow the general strategy of @xcite and relate the physics of open string sector alone and that of open / closed interactions . for concreteness , we will focus on type iib theories .",
    "the 1-brane 5-brane system will always be in the back of our mind as a concrete example . in discussing open string sector , however , we will consider the 5-brane 9-brane system instead , as on - shell polarizations for gauge particles are absent on the 1-brane world volume .",
    "they are related simply by @xmath1-duality and/or dimensional reduction .",
    "a comment is in order regarding the choice of vacuum .",
    "we will work in a background where all the fields have vanishing vacuum expectation value .",
    "this is the simplest background from the point of view of worldsheet conformal field theory .",
    "( for more general backgrounds , we must consider non - linear sigma models . )",
    "this is a special point in the moduli - space of vacua where branes are bound at threshold .",
    "they are free to fluctuate in shape and size @xcite .",
    "let us also note in passing that techniques developed in this article are applicable to a wider variety of d - brane configurations .",
    "for example , the 1-brane 5-brane configuration featured in this article is @xmath1-dual to a configuration of intersecting d - branes @xcite .",
    "intersecting branes have been found to play an important role in the d - brane construction of 4-dimensional black holes @xcite .",
    "we hope to say more about open string dynamics on intersecting branes in the future .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we study world sheets with mixed neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , and construct the vertex operator for nd strings . in section 3",
    ", we compute the three and four - point amplitude for these nd strings and compare with low energy effective theory . in section 4 , we compute the hawking emission amplitude for colliding ( 1,5 ) and ( 5,1 ) strings .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "the goal of this section is to construct the vertex operator for the nd strings .",
    "because these states are open string states , the vertex operators are inserted along the boundary of the world sheet .",
    "the fact that these states are nd strings means that the boundary condition of the world sheet changes from dirichlet to neumann and vice versa at the insertion point of its vertex operator ( see figure [ figa ] ) .",
    "the nd open string vertex operator must necessarily contain a boundary condition changing operator . to learn how one constructs such an operator , it is useful to study the scalar green s function on a disk with mixed dirichlet - neumann boundary conditions . by bringing the charges near the point where the boundary condition changes",
    ", we can infer the singularity structure of the operator product expansion of the twist operator and the scalar field .",
    "calculation of scalar green s function is a simple exercise in electrostatics .",
    "it is simplest to map the disk onto a strip parameterized by complex variable @xmath2 .",
    "the strip can be mapped onto half - plane by @xmath3 , and the half plane can be mapped on to the disk as usual .",
    "we impose neumann boundary condition at @xmath4 and dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath5 . on the half - plane",
    ", this corresponds to dirichlet boundary condition on the negative real - axis and neumann boundary condition on the positive real axis .",
    "the change of boundary condition occurs at @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ".    we can determine the potential at @xmath8 on a strip due to a charge at @xmath9 by placing image charges of charge @xmath10 at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these image charges ensure that appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "the potential at @xmath8 is therefore given by @xmath13   + \\ln \\left[\\zeta - ( \\bar{\\omega}+2\\pi n\\ , i)\\right ] \\rule{0in}{2ex } \\right\\ } \\right ) + ( \\zeta \\leftrightarrow \\bar{\\zeta } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left\\{\\ln \\left [   \\frac{\\prod_{n\\ { \\rm even } } ( \\zeta-\\omega+2 \\pi n\\ , i ) }      { \\prod_{n\\ { \\rm odd } } ( \\zeta-\\omega+2 \\pi n\\ , i ) } \\right ]   + ( \\omega \\leftrightarrow \\bar{\\omega } )   \\right\\ } + ( \\zeta \\leftrightarrow \\bar{\\zeta } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the infinite product in the above expression can be evaluated explicitly in terms of matching expression with appropriate residues and poles .",
    "mapping to half plane using @xmath14 , we find @xmath15 = \\ln\\left [      \\frac{1-\\sqrt{\\frac{z}{w}}}{1+\\sqrt{\\frac{z}{w}}}\\right].\\ ] ] this expression corresponds to scalar potential on a half plane where boundary condition changing operator is inserted at @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "we might as well conformally deform the boundary condition changing points to arbitrary points along the boundary of the half plane .",
    "this is straightforward to do , and we find @xmath17\\ ] ] where the boundary condition changing points are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the arguments of the green s functions .",
    "the electrostatic green s function is essentially the two - point correlation function of a scalar boson .",
    "however , in practice , it is the electric field , not the electrostatic potential , which makes a good conformal field .",
    "we are therefore interested in the correlation function of the primary field @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 here we have introduced a yet to be identified boundary condition changing operator @xmath24 inserted at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "now let us probe the singularity structure of operator product expansion of @xmath22 and @xmath25 by studying the @xmath26 limit . by explicit calculation",
    ", we find that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is some function .",
    "what this suggests is that we should look for an operator algebra which includes @xmath22 and @xmath25 such that their leading operator product expansion is of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is another operator with dimension @xmath31 greater than the dimension of @xmath25 .",
    "it just so happens that a closed algebra consisting of @xmath22 , @xmath25 , and @xmath30 alone exists as a conformal limit of ashkin - teller model @xcite .",
    "these fields have dimensions @xmath32= \\frac{1}{16};\\qquad [ \\tau]=\\frac{9}{16}\\ ] ] and their operator algebra is given by @xmath33 fields @xmath25 and @xmath30 are referred to as `` twist fields '' and `` excited twist fields , '' respectively .",
    "these fields have also been used in the vertex operators for type ii twisted states on a @xmath0 orbifold @xcite . in the context of orbifolds ,",
    "the square root branch cut in the operator product expansion implied that as @xmath34 circumscribes @xmath25 , it picks up a minus sign , implying that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are identified ( i.e. orbifolded ) . in open strings , there is no such thing as a twisted state .",
    "because the branch point is inserted at the boundary of the world sheet , we can maintain single valued operator algebra on the world sheet without any space - time identifications by simply pushing the branch cut to the outside the world sheet .",
    "it is therefore not necessary to orbifold the spacetime .",
    "instead , the square - root branch cut exchanges the boundary condition between dirichlet and neumann .",
    "this can also be seen from the mode expansion of twisted states @xmath37 which is identical to the mode expansion of nd strings .",
    "correlation functions involving these twist fields have been studied in @xcite using conformal field theory techniques .",
    "they are in agreement with equation ( [ green ] ) computed using the electrostatic method . by now , it is clear that these twist fields implement the change in boundary conditions .",
    "having found the operator responsible for changing the boundary condition , let us proceed to construct the vertex operators for nd string states . to be concrete",
    ", we will focus on neveu - schwarz states on 5-branes and 9-branes , oriented as follows @xmath38 which breaks @xmath39 down to @xmath40 . at times , we will refer to nd strings as ( 5,9 ) strings to indicate the brane on which the strings end . in order to implement the appropriate boundary condition on the world sheet , we need to insert a boundary condition changing operator for directions @xmath41 .",
    "supersymmetry requires that we also change the boundary condition for the world sheet fermions . in the @xmath41 directions ,",
    "neveu - schwarz states have ramond boundary conditions . therefore ,",
    "the vertex operator for the nd state must also contain spin fields for @xmath41 directions .",
    "this is consistent with the oscillator analysis @xcite where the spectrum was shown to contain a massless state which is singlet under @xmath42 and a chiral spinor of definite chirality under @xmath43 .",
    "the simplest natural candidate for the nd vertex operator then is @xmath44 the factor of @xmath45 describes the chan - paton degrees of freedom which label the brane on which the strings end .",
    "the indices @xmath46 and @xmath47 transform under fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the @xmath43 polarization of this state is given by @xmath50 .",
    "the spin field @xmath51 is given by the usual bosonization rule , except it only involves the @xmath41 directions @xmath52 and has dimension @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the boundary condition changing operators for the directions @xmath41 : @xmath55 and has dimensions @xmath56 .",
    "the charge conjugate of ( 5,9 ) string is a ( 9,5 ) string .",
    "charge conjugation flips the index structure of the chan - paton factor and changes the chirality of the spinor .",
    "the vertex operator then has the structure @xmath57    the superghost contribution to the conformal weight was fixed by the requirement that the total vertex operator be of conformal weight one .",
    "not surprisingly , an identical expression was derived in the context of orbifolds using superfield techniques and picture changing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is amusing to note that we can reproduce the formula for the zero - point energy @xcite @xmath58 by simply requiring the vertex operator to have conformal weight one . here , @xmath59 is the number of nd dimensions .",
    "the @xmath60 comes from the dimension of ghosts , and @xmath61 comes from conformal weight per embedding dimension of @xmath62 for the twist field and @xmath62 for the spin field .    we have found an explicit expression ( [ vertex ] ) for the vertex operator of nd states .",
    "this is the main result of this article . in principle",
    ", one can compute any amplitudes involving nd states along this line . in the following sections",
    ", we will work out a few examples .",
    "in this section , we will study the tree - level dynamics of nd open strings .",
    "all external states in the amplitudes we consider in this section will be open strings .",
    "the low energy dynamics of these open strings are given by @xmath63 super yang - mills with gauge fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 dimensionally reduced to six dimensions , and coupled to a hypermultiplet in fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",

    "the hypermultiplet is described by @xmath71 . in addition to gauge coupling , hypermultiplets couple to the gauge field by @xmath72-terms in the action .",
    "they are given by @xmath73 in the remainder of this section we will compute some tree level amplitudes involving the nd strings and verify that they are consistent with ( [ action ] ) in the low energy limit .",
    "one simplest kind of amplitudes one can compute in string theory are the three point tree amplitudes . let us first focus on these .",
    "a moment s thought should convince the reader that an even number of boundary condition changing operators is necessary along the boundary .",
    "indeed , terms cubic in @xmath71 s are absent in the action ( [ action ] ) . on the other hand , there is nothing inconsistent with a coupling of @xmath74 or @xmath70 with two @xmath71 s from the world sheet point of view .",
    "let us consider each case separately .",
    "the relevant vertex operators are @xmath76 the total superghost charge is @xmath77 .",
    "the amplitude is given by @xmath78 all of the correlation functions are standard except possibly for @xmath79 which follows from the fact that @xmath54 has conformal weight @xmath53 .",
    "the amplitude evaluates to @xmath80 which is in agreement with the coupling due to the gauge interaction term @xmath81 in the action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the vertex operators are the same as in the @xmath83 case , but the polarization vector @xmath84 will now point in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "just as in the previous case , the amplitude is given by @xmath85 here , we encounter a new correlation function @xmath86 in the electrostatic language , however , this amounts to measuring the electric field in the presence of boundary condition changing operators . since no sources of electric fields are present , this correlation function must vanish .",
    "this implies that @xmath82 three point function also vanishes .",
    "this is in agreement with the absence of @xmath82 coupling term in the low - energy effective action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the next simplest thing to the three - point functions are the four - point functions .",
    "these amplitudes are often written in terms of relativistic invariants @xmath87 generically , these four point amplitudes exhibit regge - pole behavior , indicating exchange of a tower of massive intermediate string states .",
    "the low energy limit is gotten by expanding the amplitude to leading order in derivatives . in this approximation",
    ", the amplitude gets contributions only from the leading @xmath88 and @xmath89-channel pole , as well as contact terms in the low energy effective theory .",
    "as was noted in the previous section , consistency requires that there be even number of external @xmath71 s in a given process .",
    "amplitudes containing exactly two @xmath71 s are particularly simple .",
    "there are three such amplitudes : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "let us consider each case separately .",
    "the relevant vertex operators are @xmath93 the total superghost charge is @xmath77 .",
    "the amplitude is given by @xmath94 although generally speaking one must compute these correlation functions in a usual manner , in this particular case there is a short - cut .",
    "the correlation function factorizes into parts involving world sheet fields with space - time index @xmath95 and parts involving space - time index @xmath41 .",
    "similar factorization takes place in a computation of @xmath96 .",
    "we can therefore cut the @xmath41 part of the @xmath90 correlation function and paste it into the more familiar @xmath96 amplitude which takes the form @xmath97 the kinematic factor @xmath98 is the familiar open string kinematic factor @xcite except for the fact that in our dimensionally reduced system , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are orthogonal to @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and all the @xmath103 s @xmath104 upon comparison of @xmath41 part of the correlation function , we note that the only difference between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is that @xmath107 is replaced by @xmath108 . therefore , the amplitude of interest is given by @xmath109 in the low energy limit , this reduces to @xmath110   { { \\rm tr}}(\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 [ \\lambda_3 , \\lambda_4])\\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{t } \\xi_3 { \\!\\cdot\\!}k_2\\ , \\xi_4 { \\!\\cdot\\!}k_1   { { \\rm tr}}(\\lambda_1",

    "for example , @xmath111 is due to the contact term in the gauge coupling @xmath112 and the term proportional to @xmath113 is due to exchange of massless gluons between @xmath114 and @xmath115 three - point vertices .",

    "these states arise from modes excited in the direction for which the world - sheet boundary condition is nd , as the oscillator number of these excitations is half integral . in the low energy limit , this amplitude reduces to @xmath124 )   + ( u_1 \\gamma^{mn } u_2 ) { \\xi_3}_m { \\xi_4}_n { { \\rm tr}}(\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 [ \\lambda_3 , \\lambda_4 ] ) .\\ ] ] from the low energy effective field theory point of view , the first term corresponds to exchange of gluon between @xmath125 and @xmath115 three - point vertices , and the second term corresponds to contact term arising from the @xmath72-term .",
    "the low energy limit of @xmath126 amplitude is found to be consistent with the low - energy effective field theory .",
    "the vertex operators are the same as in the previous two subsections , except for the orientation of the polarization vectors . upon inspection",
    ", one finds that the correlation function takes the form @xmath127 since @xmath128 and @xmath129 both vanish , it follows that @xmath92 four - point amplitude also vanishes .",
    "this too is consistent with the low - energy effective theory , as neither @xmath130 and @xmath131 three point coupling nor @xmath132 contact term is present in the theory .",
    "so far we have focused on open string sector and have found agreement between the dynamics of nd states in string theory and the low energy effective field theory .",
    "these nd strings can also interact with the closed strings propagating outside the brane through the usual mechanism of open - closed string interaction .",
    "an example of such an interaction is a process where a pair of open string collides and escapes the brane by becoming a closed string .",
    "this kind of process mimics hawking radiation if these d - branes are truly black holes @xcite and has recently been studied more carefully in @xcite .",
    "the near extremal black hole studied in @xcite is a system of 1-branes and 5-branes .",
    "this is related to the system of 5-branes and 9-branes considered in the previous section by t - dualizing along @xmath133 directions . for reference",
    ", we list the orientation of these branes below : @xmath134 directions @xmath41 are compactified , and the 5-brane wraps around the internal space and becomes a string parallel to the d1-brane .",
    "the compactification breaks the lorentz group from @xmath39 to @xmath135 .",
    "the string further breaks @xmath136 down to @xmath137 .",
    "we further compactify the @xmath138 direction . by taking this compactification radius larger than the compactification radius in @xmath41 directions ,",
    "the 1-brane 5-brane system describes a macroscopic black string wrapped around the long direction which was discussed in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath138 radius is small , this system describes a black hole in 5-dimensions .",
    "when the numbers of 1-branes and 5-branes are both large , strings stretching between 1-branes and 5-branes dominate entropically .",
    "these are precisely the nd strings we have been studying",
    ". it would be quite interesting to compute the hawking radiation rate for the decay of ( 1,5 ) strings .",
    "fortunately , it was shown recently in @xcite how amplitudes of this type can be computed quite effortlessly in terms of open - string four - point functions .",
    "these are precisely the four - point amplitudes we have been considering in the previous section . in the remainder of this section , we will apply the technique of @xcite to compute the decay amplitude of ( 1,5 ) strings",
    ".    we will only compute the decay into massless closed string states in the neveu - schwarz sector .",
    "these states are gravitons , antisymmetric tensors , and the dilaton . in the context of black hole ( string )",
    "entropy counting @xcite , these fields are dimensionally reduced to @xmath139 dimension by compactifying along the @xmath41 directions .",
    "it is therefore convenient to consider polarizations which transform differently under @xmath140 separately .",
    "the polarization breaks down under @xmath140 into the following groups : @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "polarization tensor @xmath141 describes the graviton , the antisymmetric tensor , and the dilaton in @xmath139 dimensions .",
    "states with polarization @xmath144 describes states which transform as a vector under @xmath145 lorentz group . finally , @xmath143 is a scalar under @xmath42 .",
    "note that this grouping is precisely analogous to cases @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath91 which we considered separately in the previous section .",
    "what makes these amplitudes so easy to compute is that under suitable prescription of fixing the conformal killing group , the hawking amplitude and the open string 4-point amplitude take on an identical form .",
    "the only thing which distinguishes between these amplitudes is the contour of integration .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for the details concerning this trick .",
    "we denote the momenta of incoming ( 1,5 ) and ( 5,1 ) strings by @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "because these strings are attached to the 1-brane , momentum vectors are constrained to lie in @xmath150 plane .",
    "we denote the momentum of the closed string by @xmath151 .",
    "there is one kinematic invariant for this process given by @xmath152 it will be convenient to restrict @xmath151 to lie in @xmath95 space , as the open string correlation functions in section 3 were computed for this case . since @xmath41 directions are compactified , this corresponds to considering only states neutral with respect to the kaluza - klein gauge fields in the context of hawking radiation calculation .",
    "let us start with the @xmath153 case . in the corresponding @xmath90 calculation",
    ", the correlation function was found to be identical in form to that of @xmath154 amplitude . without doing any work",
    ", it follows that the @xmath153 amplitude must be of the form identical to what was found in @xcite , namely @xmath155 where @xmath156 is obtained from the kinematic factor we found in section [ sectiona ] by imposing the kinematic constraint @xmath157 and making the substitution @xmath158 . in the low - energy limit",
    ", this amplitude reduces to @xmath159 where the trace runs only over @xmath95 directions . to enumerate the physical closed string states",
    "involved in this process , it is convenient to express the amplitude explicitly in terms allowed momentum and polarization vectors . without loss of generality , we can set @xmath160 where @xmath161 points in some @xmath133 direction . in six dimensions , there are four physical polarizations transverse to @xmath151 : @xmath162 where @xmath163 are mutually orthogonal set of vectors in the @xmath133 plane .",
    "the most general polarization for which the amplitude ( [ lowenergy ] ) is non - vanishing is of the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 are numerical coefficients . substituting ( [ generalpolarization ] ) back into ( [ lowenergy ] ) , we arrive at @xmath169 the only state for which this amplitude is non - vanishing is the dilaton , suggesting a low - energy effective coupling of the form @xmath170 here , indices @xmath67 and @xmath59 run over the dimensions of the 1-brane world volume @xmath150 .    for the case of @xmath144",
    ", we found that the correlation function vanished in the corresponding open string 4-point amplitude .",
    "this means that a pair of ( 1,5 ) strings can not decay into an @xmath144 state .",
    "finally , let us consider the @xmath143 case .",
    "the integral expression for the corresponding open - string amplitude was written down in ( [ chichiaman ] ) .",
    "the prescription of @xcite is to make a change of variables @xmath171 and integrate over @xmath172 .",
    "when this is done ( [ chichiaman ] ) becomes @xmath173^t \\left ( ( 2t+1)\\frac{(1-x^2)}{x^2 } \\delta^\\alpha_\\beta g^{mn } - \\frac{2s}{ix } [ \\gamma^{mn}]^\\alpha_\\beta\\right).\\ ] ] this integral vanishes as first term is odd under @xmath174 and the second term is odd under @xmath175 .",
    "( 1,5 ) strings can not decay into @xmath143 state .",
    "to summarize , the only massless ns - ns state to which a pair of ( 1,5 ) string can collide and decay into is the dilaton .",
    "no other fields seem to couple to the ( 1,5 ) strings .",
    "in this article we studied the perturbative dynamics of open strings in the nd sector . by studying the singularity in electrostatic potential near the boundary condition changing point on a half - plane , we were led to twist fields as a necessary ingredient . using these twist fields we constructed the vertex operators satisfying the usual requirements and carrying appropriate spacetime quantum numbers .",
    "the resulting vertex operator turned out to closely resemble the vertex operator for type ii twisted states on @xmath0 orbifolds . in rough terms , nd states are the open string analogue of twisted states .    using these vertex operators",
    ", we computed several string amplitudes .",
    "the effective low - energy dynamics on the world volume was shown to be in perfect agreement with the string theory calculation .",
    "we then followed @xcite and computed the leading amplitude for a pair of ( 1,5 ) strings to collide and escape the brane .",
    "these amplitudes exhibit the same regge - pole structure previously found for the dd strings @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , ( 1,5 ) strings are found to be quite selective in their choice of decay - particles .",
    "they appear to couple only to the dilaton .",
    "the tools developed in this article provides us with control over perturbative dynamics of nd strings .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the consequence of string theory dynamics to black hole physics .",
