    "the project we describe in this paper was motivated by the fact that the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) database contains spectroscopically observed galaxy / quasar projections which can be used to study quasar absorptions - line systems arising from known galaxies with redshifts between 0@xmath7z@xmath70.6 .",
    "qso absorption lines provide a wealth of information on the physical conditions of gaseous structures along random sightlines through the universe .",
    "the strongest absorption - line systems seen are the hydrogen absorption systems ( damped ly@xmath8 absorbers or dlas , sub - dlas , lyman - limit , and ly@xmath8-forest systems ) .",
    "quasar spectra also exhibit metal - line absorption systems , with ca  ii and na  i causing the strongest lines at rest - frame optical wavelengths .",
    "there is much current interest in studying the connection of quasar absorption - line systems with the galaxies or galaxy environments in which they are thought to arise , since this can give new information on the evolving morphological structures that they represent @xcite . with this project",
    "we seek to discover , and to characterize , new low redshift absorber galaxies with emphasis on ca  ii and na  i absorbers .",
    "there are two main approaches in uncovering the connection between the absorber host galaxy and the absorbing gas seen in quasar spectra .",
    "the first , more traditional , approach involves selecting quasar absorption - line systems through spectroscopic observations of quasars .",
    "this method is independent of the absorber host galaxy , as the line is found first , with follow - up imaging to locate the host galaxy .",
    "however , this approach has not produced a large body of galaxy / quasar pairs . with few galaxy identifications",
    ", then for most absorption systems the analysis of the host properties relies on what can be gleaned from the study of the absorption lines themselves , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the second approach in uncovering the connection between the absorbing gas and the absorber host galaxy is by searching for known low - redshift galaxies with quasars projected along lines of sights towards the galaxy .",
    "one well known example of this approach is the dwarf galaxy sbs  1543 + 593 which gives rise to a dla .",
    "the galaxy / quasar pair was first discovered by @xcite and then extensively studied in absorption and emission @xcite .",
    "a few previous attempts have been made at generating large galaxy / quasar pair catalogs .",
    "@xcite compiled a catalog of over 400 galaxy / quasar pairs with angular separations @xmath710. @xcite compiled a catalog from the literature of 8382 galaxy / quasar pairs separated by @xmath7150 kpc at the galaxy redshift .",
    "even more useful than single pairs is the identification of multiple quasars projected behind one particular foreground galaxy , allowing comparisons of the absorbing gas along multiple lines - of - sight through the galaxy .",
    "this approach requires the foreground galaxy to have a large angular extent so its cross section covers a large sky area for random sightlines and constrains the foreground galaxy to be of extremely low redshift .",
    "@xcite identified 16 agn behind the magellanic clouds selected via their x - ray emission and 146 quasar candidates behind nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite identified 5000 possible quasar candidates behind the magellanic clouds using a mid - ir color selection scheme .",
    "these and other catalogs have provided valuable source lists for follow - up observations of galaxy / quasar projections .      with the vast numbers of galaxies and quasars found in sdss , the sdss is the ideal place to search for galaxy / quasar projections on a large scale .",
    "the power of using the sdss for this project is that it provides spectra .",
    "the sdss spectra cover the wavelength range from 3900   to 9200   .",
    "the pixel size is 69  km  s@xmath1 ( varying from 0.9   at the blue end , to 2.1   at the red end of the spectra ) ; this gives a resolution of about 170  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "additional information about the seventh and final sdss data release ( sdss - dr7 ) can be obtained from @xcite    the first goal of this project is to identify and characterize a large number of galaxy / quasar projections in which the galaxies are projected onto quasar sightlines .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes how we generated a catalog of spectroscopic galaxy / quasar pairs , hereafter referred to as the parent sample , from the sdss - dr7 .",
    "we include a discussion of the basic characteristics of the parent sample .",
    "the second goal of this project is to find ca  ii and na  i absorbers associated with the galaxies in the galaxy / quasar parent sample .",
    "the lines that produce the strongest interstellar absorption lines at optical wavelengths are the ca  ii doublet at @xmath9  3934.77 , 3969.59    ( k , h ) and the na  i  d doublet at @xmath9  5891.58 , 5897.56    ( d2 , d1 ) .",
    "both ca  ii and na  i have ionization potentials that are smaller than that of h  i , 11.9  ev and 5.1  ev versus 13.6  ev , respectively , and are therefore thought to be probes of the neutral gas in and around galaxies . in section 3 , we describe the identification and selection of the ca  ii and na  i absorber galaxies ; in section 4 , we analyze and discuss the basic observational characteristics of the ca  ii and na  i absorbers , and in section 5 , we describe the absorber systems attributed to extragalactic sources .    in section 6",
    "we summarize the characteristics of the new absorbers and their host galaxies and make suggestions for follow - up studies .",
    "the sdss - dr7 quasar catalog provides the parent quasar sample @xcite .",
    "this catalog of bona fide quasars , that have redshifts checked by eye and luminosities and line widths that meet the formal quasar definition , contains 105783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars , and represents the final product of the sdss - i and sdss - ii quasar survey . the quasar catalog uses a cosmology with h@xmath10=70 km  s@xmath1 , @xmath11=0.3 , and @xmath12=0.7 , which we adopted for the remainder of this paper .",
    "the sdss - dr7 specphoto view provided the parent galaxy sample .",
    "the specphoto table includes only those objects where the specobj is a scienceprimary , and the best photoobj is a primary object and the object has clean spectra .",
    "we selected from this table all objects that were morphologically typed as a galaxy ( type = galaxy ) and have the spectrum of a galaxy ( specclass = galaxy ) .",
    "this returned 798948 galaxy spectra .",
    "we identified all pairs for which    1 .",
    "the quasar s spectrum is projected within 100  kpc of a galaxy s spectrum and 2 .",
    "the quasar s spectrum has a redshift which is larger than the galaxy s , @xmath13 , by an amount equal to the total redshift error , @xmath3 , of the galaxy and the quasar , @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "steps 1 and 2 yielded 97489 pairs of galaxy / quasar spectra .",
    "we refer to these pairs as the galaxy - quasar parent sample .",
    "the full list of pairs is available for download as a fits table with the online version of this paper , a sample of which is provided in table  [ tab : parent ] .",
    "prior to the absorber selection we also apply an additional constraint on the parent sample where    1 .",
    "we remove cases in which intervening ly@xmath8 forest lines potentially cause misidentification .",
    "we perform step 3 for both ca  ii and na  i , thus creating two parent samples , one of 95651 pairs ( na  i ) and one of 81912 pairs ( ca  ii ) . for the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss the overall parent sample of 97489 pairs .",
    "an issue that affects the construction of our sample is the 55 ",
    "fiber collision problem in sdss . on a given tile in sdss",
    ", there are a maximum of 592 possible fibers for placement onto a viable target .",
    "the spacing between each fiber on a tile is 55  .",
    "targets that lie less than 55  from each other are spectroscopically unobservable unless recovered with overlapping tiles on the sky . about 6@xmath17 of all sdss targets are missed in this manner @xcite . with approximately 1.1 million objects targeted for spectroscopy",
    ", 6@xmath17 corresponds to @xmath566000 objects .",
    "this however does not necessarily imply that the incompleteness of close pairs is @xmath56@xmath17 .",
    "the spectroscopic incompleteness of our sample in particular ( close pairs within 100  kpc ) will be addressed in a future paper . at the mean redshift for sdss galaxies ( z@xmath50.1 ) , 55",
    " corresponds to @xmath5101  kpc . for the majority of our galaxies",
    ", we are searching well within the fiber collision radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : zhisto ] shows the redshift distributions of the galaxy and quasar spectra in the parent sample of 97489 pairs .",
    "the mean redshift of the galaxy spectra is ( @xmath18,@xmath3)=(0.00649,0.00005 ) , and the mean redshift of the quasar spectra is ( @xmath18,@xmath3)=(1.6,0.8 ) .",
    "we see that , indeed , the distribution of qsos lies mostly behind that of the galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : bhisto ] displays the impact parameter distribution of the pairs .",
    "we find an increasing number of pairs as the impact parameter increases .",
    "this distribution is expected given the large number of low - redshift galaxies seen in figure  [ fig : zhisto ] .",
    "the 100  kpc search radius around these low - redshift galaxies produces a much larger search area on the sky , from which a greater number of sightlines will be observed .",
    "the mean impact parameter of the distribution is ( @xmath18,@xmath3)=(66,24 )  kpc .",
    "the spectra which define the galaxy - quasar parent sample do not necessarily belong to unique galaxy / quasar pairs .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the sdss database contains multiple spectra for some galaxies .",
    "a typical example is a nearby star - forming galaxy for which the sdss targeted its nucleus plus one or more bright h  ii regions .",
    "second , some nearby galaxies cover such a large area on the sky that they intercept two or more quasar sight - lines . if the coverages of multiple nearby galaxies overlap , then it is also possible to have more than one galaxy intercept the same quasar sightline .",
    "we searched all quasar spectra in the parent sample for ca  ii and na  i absorption lines located at the redshift of the foreground galaxy , permitting a deviation of @xmath0  500  km  s@xmath1 from the systemic galaxy velocity to allow for the possibility that the quasar sightline intercepts the galaxy s gas where it has an additional internal motion due to rotation , inflow , or outflow .",
    "our line identification procedure is as follows .",
    "first , we use an automated line finder to create a candidate list of ca  ii and na  i systems .",
    "second , we review the candidate features by eye to produce final line lists .",
    "we perform the automated line identification on the two reduced parent samples of 95651 and 81912 pairs for na  i and ca  ii , respectively .",
    "the later visual inspection of the candidate detections also showed a small number of possible intervening mg  ii , fe  ii , or c  iv systems that interfered with a positive identification of the doublet lines .",
    "we adopted the automated line finder of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) quasar absorption line key project @xcite which is optimized to look for weak , unresolved quasar absorption lines .",
    "we followed the prescription as outlined in churchill ( in prep . ) .",
    "the prescription searches for significant unresolved features by weighting each pixel by the instrumental spread function ( isf ) , a gaussian that describes how the pixel counts are redistributed below the limiting resolution of the instrument .",
    "the isf , @xmath19 , is defined as @xmath20}\\ ] ] in practice , the isf is discretized as a gaussian model , p@xmath21 , symmetric about a pixel i , that spans m=2j0 + 1 elements , where j0 = 2p , and p is the number of pixels per resolution element .",
    "the discretized isf is given as @xmath22 } /   \\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^m \\exp{[-x_{kj}^2 ] } \\\\",

    "is the gaussian width of the isf at pixel j , where r is the spectral resolution , and k  =  j  +  ( i-1 )  -  j0 is the wavelength index relative to the central pixel j.    the procedure is outlined as follows :    1 .",
    "* weight the flux decrement in each pixel by the isf : * + the weighted equivalent width and uncertainty in pixel j is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 d@xmath27 = 1-(i@xmath27/i@xmath28 ) is the flux decrement in pixel k , and @xmath29 = 0.5@xmath30(@xmath31-@xmath32 ) is the wavelength dispersion in pixel j. 2 .   * search the spectrum for pixels satisfying the condition : * + @xmath33 where n@xmath34 is a user - specified significance threshold .",
    "3 .   * determine the pixels spanned by feature i : * + for a given pixel that satisfies the above condition , identify the start and end pixels of feature i by scanning the spectrum blueward and redward of pixel j until the conditions @xmath35 are met .",
    "4 .    * determine the significance of the candidate feature * + once the pixel span of feature i has been identified , the observed equivalent width , ew , and uncertainty , @xmath36 , of feature i are @xmath37 where e@xmath27 = @xmath38d@xmath27 is the unweighted equivalent width in pixel k , and @xmath39 = @xmath38@xmath40 is the uncertainty in e@xmath27 .",
    "the final step is to calculate the significance , s , of feature i and check that it satisfies your required significance threshold . @xmath41",
    "if the candidate feature satisfies the above criteria , then it is kept as a candidate absorption line .",
    "the line finder algorithm expects as input a normalized flux array .",
    "we therefore divided the quasar spectra by the global continuum fit stored in the ` spspec ' 1d spectral fits file . in some cases the sought - after doublets were superimposed on a broad emission line in the quasar s spectrum .",
    "we thus re - defined a local continuum anchored to the quasar s normalized spectrum within @xmath0  1000  km  s@xmath1 of the expected doublets .",
    "we automatically searched for lines that are located to within @xmath0  500  km  s@xmath1 of their expected positions , given the galaxy redshift .",
    "the significance of a candidate line was calculated based on equation  [ eq : sig ] .",
    "we chose a significance threshold , n@xmath42 , of two .",
    "all lines with significances less than this threshold were automatically rejected .",
    "this step eliminated a very large number of pairs .",
    "lines were kept as candidates for visual inspection if their significances were equal to or exceeded our specified significance threshold .",
    "we created three candidate line lists .",
    "the first list contained ca  ii doublets . for optically thin gas ,",
    "the ratio of the primary and secondary line is 2:1 , while for saturated lines , the doublet ratio approaches 1:1 .",
    "we use this allowed region to define the acceptable strengths of the weaker , ca  ii  h line , i.e. the ca  ii  h equivalent width must be , at least , half as strong as the ca  ii  k line and , at most , equal in strength to the ca  ii  k line .",
    "questionable candidates , which passed the line finder but not the visual inspection , were moved to a separate list . among the parent sample for ca  ii systems ,",
    "we claim 92 detections ( a in table  [ tab : parent ] ) , 1641 questionable candidates ( q in table  [ tab : parent ] ) , and 80179 non - detections ( n in table  [ tab : parent ] ) .",
    "main reasons why a doublet was rejected during visual inspection include : ( a ) possibility of confusion with an interloping non - ca  ii system ,",
    "( b ) a pixel pattern in the doublet region which looked inconsistent with the profile of a real doublet , and ( c ) the doublet region has a low signal - to - noise . for the 92 detections ,",
    "the line finder yields a mean line significance level of the ca  ii  k line of ( @xmath18,@xmath3)=(2.9@xmath00.1,0.6@xmath00.1 ) .",
    "the ca  ii absorber catalog consists of 92 detections involving pairs of individual galaxy and quasar spectra .",
    "these 92 detections result from 13 unique galaxy spectra and 61 unique quasar spectra .",
    "listed in table  [ tab : uniqcaii ] are the individual ca  ii absorber galaxies , with the number of quasars found associated with each particular galaxy , along with any notes regarding that particular galaxy .",
    "table  [ tab : uniqcaii ] highlights the fact that a low - redshift galaxy may have a large search radius such that many quasar sightlines are intersected , producing a large number of non - unique spectral pairs . with more than one of these galaxies ,",
    "it is therefore also possible to have one quasar be considered in multiple pairs with different galaxies .",
    "these facts combine to produce the numbers of unique galaxy and quasar spectra above .",
    "for example , the galaxy sdss  j21633.70 + 130153.6 had 21 quasars identified within 100  kpc which exhibited ca  ii absorption located within @xmath0500  km  @xmath43 of the galaxy redshift .",
    "this system would then account for 1 out of 13 unique galaxy spectra , 21 out of 61 unique quasar spectra , and 21 out of 92 ca  ii detections .",
    "also see the last paragraph of section 2.2 .      the second line list contained na  i systems .",
    "some of the na  i doublets are resolved and some are blended . for partially blended doublets ,",
    "occasionally the line finder failed to distinguish both components of the doublet , instead treating the entire doublet as the na  i  d2 line .",
    "it then attempted to find a ` false ' weaker component for na  i. this led us to treat the na  i candidates differently from the ca  ii candidates .",
    "we required that the line finder identify the ` na  i  d2 line ' of the doublet only , then visually rejected as questionable candidates lines showing profile shapes that appear inconsistent with a blended physical doublet . as with the ca  ii systems , we also visually rejected na  i systems that had ( a ) the possibility of an interloping non - na  i system , and ( b ) systems with low signal - to - noise within the doublet region . among the parent sample for na  i systems",
    ", we claim 583 detections , 3796 questionable candidates , and 91272 non detections .",
    "many of the candidate systems were found at very low velocity and were affected by incomplete na  i sky - line subtraction .",
    "this turned out to be a severe problem . to minimize contamination from incorrect sky subtraction , we excluded from the sample all candidate lines that fell between 5888.0    and 5901.0  (s in table  [ tab : parent ] ) .",
    "this reduced the number of na  i detections down to 16 systems .",
    "for the 16 detections , the line finder yields a mean line significance of ( @xmath18,@xmath3)=(2.8@xmath00.2,0.7@xmath00.3 ) .",
    "these 16 detections result from 15 unique galaxy spectra and 12 unique quasar spectra . listed in table  [",
    "tab : uniqnai ] are the individual na  i absorber galaxies , with the same columns as in table  [ tab : uniqcaii ] .",
    "we generated a third list in which both the ca  ii  k line and the na  i  d2 line are detected by the line finder .",
    "in this list we use the ca  ii  k line as the  confirmation \" line for the na  i  d2 line , and vice versa .",
    "this required that we impose a limit on the velocity agreement between the two species .",
    "we adopted a limit of 3 pixels , or 210  km  s@xmath1 . the visual inspection of this list , after applying the same sky subtraction processing as in the na  i sample , yielded 2 detections .",
    "the line finder gives a mean line significance for the na  i lines of 2.8 , and 2.3 for the ca  ii  k lines .",
    "these 2 detections result from 2 unique galaxy and quasar spectra . listed in table  [ tab : uniqboth ]",
    "are the individual absorber galaxies .    in all tables and figures , ` na  i ' refers to those absorbers in the na  i doublet sample . `",
    "ca  ii ' refers to those absorbers in the ca  ii doublet sample . `",
    "both ' refers to absorbers that have at least the ca  ii  k line and the na  i  d2 line detected .",
    "these absorbers are listed in the ` ca  ii  k and na  i  d2 sample ' and may also be listed in either the ca  ii or na  i doublet sample .",
    "the absorber catalog represents a merger of the above three final line lists of detections .",
    "there may well be additional ca  ii and na  i systems among the questionable candidates .",
    "we investigated this possibility by stacking the spectra of questionable candidates using various cuts , and the doublets do become detectable in some of the stacks",
    ". further analysis on the stacked spectra will be detailed in a future paper .",
    "the confirmation of questionable candidates on an individual basis requires future spectroscopy with a higher signal - to - noise and spectral resolution .    as the line finder would occasionally mistake a na  i blend for the na  i  d2 line of the doublet",
    ", it would measure an equivalent width across the entire line profile , as opposed to just the na  i  d2 component .",
    "due to this , we decided to remeasure the equivalent widths manually , to insure each line has a proper value . to be consistent , we remeasured all the lines within the absorber sample .",
    "we measured the rest equivalent width ( rew ) , equivalent width error , central wavelength , and central wavelength error , of the lines .",
    "the equivalent widths were computed from a direct summation of the pixels within the line region .",
    "the line equivalent width error is the total error of the sum of the pixel equivalent width errors .",
    "the central wavelength of a line is the equivalent - width weighted mean of the pixels wavelengths ; its errors is the uncertainty of the mean .",

    "table  [ tab : lineinfo ] is a list of the measured line parameters for each absorber .",
    "the columns are galaxy spectrum , sdss redshift , the catalog the absorber belongs to , the local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity along the sightline to the quasar , then for line 1 in the doublet : the rew of the line , the significance of the line ( rew/@xmath44 ) , the heliocentric redshift of the line , and the velocity offset of the line from that of the expected position . for line 2",

    "the dotted line indicates the velocity offset of the absorber from the galaxy position .",
    "this absorber catalog consists of 108 pairs of galaxy - quasar spectra with either the ca  ii or na  i doublet detected , or both .",
    "the absorbers can be broadly classified into galactic or extra - galactic systems .",
    "the selection of these systems may vary depending on the science one wishes to explore through follow - up observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : rewvssig ] shows the significance of the equivalent width measurements as a function of the rest equivalent width of the strong line in a doublet ( ca  ii  k or na  i  d2 ) .",
    "the 3@xmath3 limit , or 99@xmath17 confidence limit , is indicated as a red horizontal line in the figure .",
    "we find 43 systems with the significance of either ca  ii  k or na  i  d2 line @xmath15 3.0 , 53 systems with a significance between 2 - 3 , and 12 systems with a significance @xmath72.0 .",
    "while we set the line finder to only accept lines with a significance @xmath15 2 , manually remeasuring the equivalent widths and errors has , in some instances , resulted in different significances than what the line finder reported .",
    "this is due to having slightly different boundaries defining the line edges during the direct summation of the equivalent widths in each pixel .    in the milky way ,",
    "ca  ii and na  i equivalent widths have measured values less than what has been observed in external galaxies .",
    "ca  ii  k equivalent widths have been measured in the range of 0.08 - 0.8   , with the median equivalent width around 0.18    @xcite . @xcite",
    "searched milky way sightlines ( within 400  pc of the sun ) and found ca  ii  k equivalent widths @xmath70.3   , and na  i  d2 equivalent widths @xmath70.5   .",
    "@xcite showed that the larger equivalent widths seen in external galaxies can be recovered from the smaller values seen in the milky way when taking into account contributions from multiple , unresolved components , as well as projection effects through a highly extended , inclined disc .",
    "he showed that the equivalent widths seen in the milky way would be roughly doubled when viewed from outside our galaxy .",
    "equivalent widths , seen in nearby external galaxies , of ca  ii and na  i range from 0.4 - 1.0    for the ca  ii  k line @xcite and between @xmath50.2 - 1.8    for the na  i  d2 line @xcite , or @xmath52.2    for blended na  i systems @xcite .",
    "there is overall agreement between our rew values and those typically seen in the milky way and in nearby external galaxies .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : rewvssig ] , we find that the ca  ii absorbers and the na  i absorbers naturally divide , with the ca  ii absorbers located primarily at rews  @xmath45  0.5    and the na  i absorbers primarily occupying the region with rew  @xmath46  0.5   .",
    "this division is possibly due to a bias between the ca  ii and na  i samples , where the ca  ii systems include greater contributions from galactic sightlines .",
    "while both samples should include contributions from galactic and extragalactic sightlines , the cut we placed on the na  i sample to remove regions contaminated by incomplete na  i sky subtraction , and hence , low velocity systems , may have effectively removed galactic contributors . since",
    "this cut was not placed on the ca  ii sample , it becomes biased towards galactic absorbers . with this in mind ,",
    "our ca  ii subset could be a mix of galactic and extragalactic absorbers , weighted more towards galactic contributions .",
    "there are 49 ca  ii systems with rew@xmath150.3   , that could be extragalactic in origin . our na  i subset can also be a mix of galactic and extragalactic systems , weighted more towards extragalactic systems .",
    "all of our na  i systems have a rew@xmath150.5   , and thus could be considered extragalactic , based on their strength .",
    "there are 2 na  i systems that are resolved and have unusually high rews for what has been seen previously , but we have checked for interloping absorption systems and none could be identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : rewvszgal ] shows the rew of our absorbers as a function of sdss galaxy redshift .",
    "we again see the split in rew between the ca  ii and na  i absorbers , as well as a separation in redshift . given the possible velocity overlap between virgo cluster galaxies and high - velocity clouds ( see section  4.2 ) , if we consider the redshift region @xmath20.01 , we find that the minimum rew seen in the resulting absorbers is 0.5   .",
    "while this can not rule out extragalactic absorbers having rew values below @xmath50.5   , this is consistent with rew values seen in extragalactic absorbers so far . the large cluster of ca  ii systems with rew  @xmath45  0.5   at low redshifts also points to a domination by contributions from galactic sightlines .",
