    "while the existence and characteristic distributions of empty regions are already implicit in early self - similar models of structure hierarchy in the universe ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , it was the observational discovery of large , approximately spherical regions almost devoid of visible galaxies known as voids and supervoids ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) that sparked further theoretical work on underdense regions in the universe .",
    "this included analytical studies of the dynamical evolution of individual voids and shell - crossing ( @xcite ) as well as statistical properties of the void distribution . applying a simple sign - reversal argument , @xcite pointed out that the sphericity of underdense regions increases due to gravitational dynamics , so that it is in fact natural to expect approximately spherical voids . early theoretical approaches to void statistics used poisson statistics of empty regions , as developed by @xcite , voronoi tesselations ( @xcite ) , and structure formation theory in analogy to the statistics of overdensity peaks ( @xcite ) in gaussian primordial density fluctuations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "self - similar features in the void size distribution were also noted ( e.g. , @xcite ) . of course , much of this earlier work concentrated on einstein - de - sitter cosmology with @xmath0 , as was favoured then . especially after the discovery of the near - isotropic cmb , it was realized that the largest observable voids were difficult to explain theoretically and may therefore provide important cosmological constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "attention was also drawn to galaxy properties within voids ( e.g. , the void phenomenon of @xcite ) .",
    "now , with the advent of the @xmath1cdm paradigm , detailed numerical studies of void statistics ( e.g. , @xcite for a comparison ) and analytical studies of void shape evolution in redshift space ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been conducted .",
    "moreover , the void formation theory based on the excursion set formalism of primordial density fluctuations has been refined to include the notion of hierarchy ( @xcite ) . this formalism has been extended more recently to investigate effects of non - gaussianity ( e.g. , @xcite ) and modified theories of gravity ( e.g. , @xcite ) on voids .",
    "the possibility of using voids for precision cosmology has also been explored ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the observational side ,",
    "a void catalogue extracted from the sdss data release 7 has recently been published ( @xcite ) , which illustrates the strong dependence of void statistics on the underlying void definition .",
    "the effect of survey masks and boundaries has been considered in detail by @xcite , and void sphericity properties have been noted by @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown how weak lensing observations may be used to measure the mass distribution of voids . in this paper , we propose a new geometrical approach to void statistics based on the idea that voids can be modelled well by spheres in the euclidean 3-space .",
    "each such sphere is represented by a point in the 4-dimensional configuration space of spheres , with radius and centre position as coordinates . since the spatial contact between these spheres is physically important ( e.g. , in the evolution of voids ) , it is interesting to consider transformations of the configuration space that preserve such contact relations , namely conformal transformations , in order to define a distance measure on the configuration space .",
    "given these assumptions , it turns out that the configuration space has a de - sitter geometry , with timelike radii and spacelike centre positions of the spheres , which emerges from classical sphere geometry and is different from cosmological de - sitter spacetime .",
    "one can now study the size distribution of spherical voids in the universe in terms of their distribution over this de - sitter configuration space .",
    "the approach presented here has been inspired by other notions of configuration space measures in cosmology ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and another application of this de - sitter configuration space of spheres in a different astronomical context has been proposed recently ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section [ sec : desitter ] , we give a brief review of the de - sitter configuration space for the general case of @xmath2-spheres in @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space and indicate its conformal structure .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of a uniform distribution over the 4-dimensional de - sitter configuration space used to model voids , that is @xmath4 , in section [ sec : uniform ] .",
    "we shall derive , firstly , the corresponding void size distribution for voids in the whole ( unrestricted ) 3-space and find a self - similar power - law .",
    "secondly , the effect of restricting void positions in 3-space due to survey geometry is studied , which naturally breaks the self - similarity of the size distribution .",
    "this is carried out analytically for a survey volume shaped as a spherical sector . then in section [ sec : comparison ] , we investigate how the void size distributions predicted by the unrestricted and restricted uniform de - sitter distributions compare with actual void size distributions .",
    "we consider , firstly , theoretical models of self - similarity and the excursion set formalism , to find that the power - law from the unrestricted uniform distribution is , to an extent , consistent with the expectation from structure formation theory .",
    "to illustrate this and the effect of survey geometry restriction in a data set , we apply an n - body simulation using the gadget2 ( @xcite ) code and extract spherical voids .",
    "a comparison with the fitting formula of @xcite is given .",
    "we also discuss how the scaling dimension of the large scale structure can be estimated , using a fractal model of random spherical cutouts which is reviewed in the appendix .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions and comments on possible further applications of this idea .",
    "we begin by briefly recapitulating the notion of a configuration space of spheres in euclidean space and its de - sitter geometry , as discussed in some more detail in @xcite ; see also @xcite , pp .",
    "646647 . consider an @xmath2-dimensional unoriented sphere @xmath5 in @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath6 given in terms of its radius @xmath7 and its centre at @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that , to each such sphere , one can uniquely assign a point @xmath9 , in @xmath10-dimensional minkowski space @xmath11 endowed with the usual metric @xmath12 , with @xmath13 on the @xmath14-dimensional hypersurface @xmath15 which is a de - sitter quadric .",
    "in other words , each sphere with a given centre and radius corresponds to a point on an @xmath14-dimensional de - sitter space @xmath16 which can therefore be interpreted as a configuration space of spheres . since for unoriented spheres",
    "one may set @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the space of unoriented spheres is in fact given by half of the full de - sitter quadric , sometimes referred to as de - sitter space modulo the antipodal map @xmath19 .",
    "geometrically , the coordinates @xmath20 of a sphere can be regarded as a form of lie cycle coordinates for the laguerre cycle representing the sphere ( see , e.g. , the appendix of @xcite for more mathematical details ) . taking @xmath21 , as coordinates of the de - sitter configuration space ,",
    "its metric @xmath22 induced by the ambient minkowski metric in the usual way can be read off from the line element @xmath23 so that , with respect to the coordinate - induced basis , @xmath24    -spheres @xmath25 in @xmath6 , here illustrated for the case @xmath26 and , in projection , @xmath4 , can be characterized by the euclidean angle @xmath27 given in eq . ( [ angle ] ) , which is an invariant of the isometries of the de - sitter configuration space . ]    hence , this metric measures the distance between spheres in terms of their configuration , that is , their radii and positions in space .",
    "isometries of this de - sitter space can be identified with conformal transformations of spheres , for the following reason .",
    "consider two intersecting spheres @xmath28 and @xmath29 given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath32 so that isometries leave the euclidean angle @xmath27 between the two spheres invariant which , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] , measures their contact .",
    "indeed , it provides a geometrical interpretation for the line element ( [ lineelement ] ) , since for two spheres that are infinitesimally close in the configuration space so that they are nearly identical in their radii and positions , one finds , @xmath33 finally , a measure of the number of spheres having radii within @xmath34 $ ] and centres in the volume element @xmath35 at @xmath36 is provided by the volume element , @xmath37 of the @xmath14-dimensional de - sitter configuration space .",
    "in order to study the distribution of cosmic voids from the geometrical perspective of the de - sitter configuration space , we shall model them as unoriented @xmath39-spheres in @xmath40 . hence specializing the previous discussion to the case @xmath4",
    ", the corresponding 4-dimensional configuration space has the de - sitter geometry @xmath41 with metric given by ( [ ds - metric ] ) .",
    "then the configuration space volume element for voids with radii in @xmath34 $ ] and with centres in the volume element @xmath42 at @xmath43 becomes @xmath44 from eq .",
    "( [ ds - volume ] ) . also , the infinitesimal number of voids @xmath45 with radii in @xmath34 $ ] centred within the volume element at @xmath46 can be described in terms of a non - negative distribution function over the configuration space , @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 in this section , we will consider the simplest distribution in this framework , corresponding to a uniform distribution of voids over the de - sitter configuration space such that @xmath49 clearly , this uniform distribution has the property that all voids are counted regardless of their position in @xmath40 : there is no restriction due to survey geometry and any mutual overlap of voids is allowed .",
    "the corresponding distribution function @xmath50 is independent of the position in space , @xmath51 from eq .",
    "( [ ds - volume2 ] ) and ( [ f1 ] ) . defining the void number density as the number of void centres per volume element in @xmath40",

    "a more realistic modification of this cumulative number density should take into account that any actual void survey can , of course , only encompass a finite subregion of @xmath40 .",
    "we shall investigate this aspect in the following .",
    "centred at the observer @xmath58 , the limits @xmath59 and @xmath60 for voids of radius @xmath53 ( solid circles ) are illustrated , see eq.s ( [ limits ] ) . the largest void for the given survey geometry , at @xmath61 with radius @xmath62 given by eq .",

    "the assumption of a uniform distribution of voids over their de - sitter configuration space results in a differential number density @xmath69 of @xmath70 void centres per volume in @xmath40 , per void radius @xmath71 or void volume @xmath72 , respectively , again by eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "now suppose that a survey counts only those voids which are wholly within the survey region @xmath73 . for simplicity",
    ", consider a survey geometry shaped as a spherical sector with opening angle @xmath65 and maximal ( comoving ) distance @xmath63 from an observer who is situated at its apex and coordinate origin . then , in terms of spherical polar coordinates , the survey region can be described by @xmath74 and we let @xmath75 .",
    "the total volume of the survey is then @xmath76 a given void of radius @xmath53 will be counted in the distribution if it lies wholly within @xmath73 , that is , if the coordinates of its centre @xmath77 satisfy the conditions @xmath78 where the lower and upper coordinate limits are determined by voids touching the boundary of @xmath73 .",
    "the conditions for these can be read off from fig .",

    "[ fig : cumul ] shows it for three choices of the opening angle @xmath65 of the survey geometry .",
    "these results for the number density ( [ density2 ] ) and cumulative number density of voids illustrate how the intrinsic distribution and the observed distribution can differ substantially due to the restrictions imposed by the survey geometry .",
    "small voids , of course , tend to be affected less by the survey geometry and therefore approach asymptotically the power - law ( [ cumul ] ) of the intrinsic distribution .",
    "as shown in section [ sec : unrestricted ] , the uniform de - sitter distribution without survey geometry restriction yields a power - law size distribution given by @xmath95 for the differential number density of voids , from eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) .",
    "this is obviously self - similar in the sense that a change in volume scale , @xmath96 , also implies @xmath97 .",
    "interpreted as a probability distribution , we can identify this as a pareto distribution of index one .",
    "considering , on the other hand , a sufficiently large but finite set of voids in a fixed volume of @xmath40 , then the integer rank @xmath98 of a void of volume @xmath83 in a decreasing ordered sequence of volumes is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "hence , one can see that zipf s law is satisfied , @xmath100 self - similarity and power - laws are a characteristic feature of fractals , and their applicability to cosmic voids has been investigated early on ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , zipf s law in this context has been studied by @xcite , followed by more general considerations of the fractal properties of void distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) including the notion of multifractals , which admits a range rather than a single fractal dimension , and lacunarity , which characterizes the void distribution at a given fractal dimension .",
    "this is , of course , also related to the question whether and to what extent the large scale structure itself can be described by fractals ( see , e.g. , the review by @xcite ) . denoting the ( comoving ) distances of galaxies in @xmath40 by @xmath101 , one can define a local scaling index in terms of the cumulative number count of galaxies @xmath102 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , pp .",
    "12441245 ) , @xmath103 this can be interpreted as a ( single ) fractal dimension if it is constant and independent of the scale @xmath104 , for instance the hausdorff dimension of a cantor set if @xmath105 ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) , in which case the corresponding number count is simply a power - law of the form @xmath106 .",
    "if the homogeneity postulate of the cosmological principle holds , one expects @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "the detailed interpretation of @xmath109 , however , depends on the homogeneity scale @xmath110 , the correlation length @xmath111 and sample size @xmath112 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , pp .",
    "236240 ) , as well as on the finiteness of the sample number ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that a simple fractal model , mandelbrot s _ random tremas _ interpreted as voids , provides another geometrical perspective on the cumulative number density of eq .",
    "( [ cumul ] ) implied by the uniform de - sitter distribution , which also connects its constant of proportionality @xmath113 with the fractal dimension @xmath109 of the large scale structure mentioned above .",
    "consider @xmath40 with a homogeneous mass density and introduce a sequence of spherical cutouts ( tremas ) to model voids .",
    "these spheres are placed randomly so that arbitrary overlap is allowed . for a particular size distribution of these spheres , it turns out that an infinite sequence will not empty the space completely but leave in general a non - empty complementary set of some hausdorff dimension @xmath109 .",
    "the cumulative number density of the spheres in this case , counting all regardless of overlap , is ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) @xmath114 which has the same scaling behaviour as the unrestricted uniform de - sitter distribution , for which arbitrary overlap of spheres is also allowed as discussed in section [ sec : unrestricted ] . interpreting the unrestricted uniform de - sitter distribution in terms of the random trema model",
    ", we can therefore identify @xmath115 from eq .",
    "( [ cumul ] ) . in the case of a finite data set",
    ", one should require that the sample size is much greater than the correlation length , @xmath116 , for eq .",
    "( [ trema2 ] ) to apply , as will be discussed further in section [ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "finally , it may be emphasized that it is the overlap of the cutouts allowed in this model which causes the fixed exponent in the power - law @xmath99 and relegates information about @xmath109 to the constant of proportionality .",
    "this is different from the disjoint cutouts considered more usually , e.g. by @xcite , which contain @xmath109 in the exponent .      in their pioneering paper , @xcite",
    "point out that , starting from gaussian density perturbations in a friedmann cosmology and considering the linear quasi - newtonian perturbation analysis of the growing mode , the mass distribution at late times does not depend on the initial mass distribution .",
    "they identify a simple physical reason for this self - similarity in the existence of two dimensionless quantities governing the gravitational collapse , which remain approximately _ constant _ during the matter - dominated phase on subhorizon scales .",
    "the press - schechter argument yielding a power - law size distribution can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider massive particles distributed in some comoving volume .",
    "then the mass density function @xmath117 on this volume is obtained by applying some smoothing window function with scale length @xmath118 at each point . at sufficiently early times",
    ", this density function will be approximately constant , @xmath119 however , if the density within a window is greater than some ( fixed dimensionless , say ) critical density so that @xmath120 around overdensity peaks due to fluctuations in the density function , then the mass within the window will gravitationally collapse and ultimately form a bound object .",
    "again , for sufficiently early times , one may take these fluctuations to be gaussian , such that the volume fraction of points with collapsing windows is given by @xmath121 these windows will contain slightly different masses , but basically @xmath122 . also , the variance may depend on the smoothing scale and hence also on the mass , @xmath123 , for some spectral index @xmath124 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 is a function @xmath126 as well , and so the differential number density @xmath127 of ultimately bound objects obeys @xmath128 and hence @xmath129,\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the mass scale of the exponential term , which gives rise to a cutoff at large masses ( or volumes ) . for @xmath131 and a scale - invariant @xmath132 with @xmath133 ,",
    "this yields the inverse square power - law @xmath134 it turns out that this power - law emerges also in the modified press - schechter approach proposed by @xcite , which uses an adaptive window scale @xmath118 .",
    "now in the context of voids , one can consider underdensity troughs rather than overdensity peaks ( as in @xcite ) and , since gaussian fluctuations are symmetric about the average density , the same power - law applies , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "then since @xmath135 , we recover ( [ square ] ) from ( [ pslimit ] ) .",
    "of course , in addition to the large volume cutoff , this simple excursion set argument ignores effects of void hierarchy which affect small volumes in particular ( i.e. , by the void - in - void and void - in - cloud processes , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the power - law will only apply within a range of volumes .",
    "hence , at least within a range of volumes , the power - law ( [ square ] ) has a physical basis in the excursion set formalism : the gaussian fluctuations producing voids give rise to a self - similar power - law size distribution which can be described geometrically as a uniform distribution over the de - sitter configuration space of spheres .",
    "now in order to compare the void size distributions predicted by the unrestricted and restricted uniform de - sitter distributions from section [ sec : uniform ] with data , we perform an n - body simulation with the parallel tree - particle mesh code , gadget2 ( @xcite ) , using cosmological parameters consistent with the wmap seven - year results ( @xcite ) , namely spatial curvature @xmath133 , dark energy density @xmath136 , hubble parameter @xmath137 and spectral index @xmath138 . the initial condition for the simulation is generated at redshift @xmath139 using the code developed by @xcite , who employ second order lagrangian perturbation theory .",
    "the simulation is run in a cubic box with side length @xmath140mpc in comoving coordinates with periodic boundary conditions , and @xmath141 dark matter particles whose individual mass is scaled to match the mass density of the universe . at redshift @xmath142",
    ", voids are extracted according to the following algorithm .",
    "firstly , the discrete simulation data are smoothed to construct the matter density function , using a gaussian window with adaptive length scale .",
    "this smoothing length is chosen to be the distance to the 20th nearest particle at each cell .",
    "secondly , a set of spherical voids is extracted by defining density minima as void centres and determining the radius for each void as the largest radius @xmath53 centered at the density minimum for which the average density of the enclosed sphere @xmath143 is less than a critical value @xmath144 relative to the average density @xmath145 of the box .",
    "hence , for our present purposes , we allow arbitrary overlap of the spherical voids and do not apply an additional merging algorithm to these voids ( cf .",
    "@xcite , also called _ protovoids _ ) , which would give rise to non - spherical voids .",
    "this should allow for are meaningful comparison with the uniform distribution over the de - sitter configuration space of spheres , which allows void overlap as noted in section [ sec : unrestricted ] .",
    "the resulting cumulative number density of voids in the simulation box as a function of void volume is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] .",
    "the largest void has a volume of @xmath146mpc@xmath147 , which can be interpreted in terms of the exponential cutoff in the excursion set formalism mentioned in section [ sec : excursion ] , and whose value is comparable with the simulation results reported in fig . 7 of @xcite .",
    "until the curve flattens at very small volumes  here , of course , rather due to simulation resolution and smoothing scale than effects of void hierarchy  , the cumulative number density for @xmath148 can indeed be approximated by the power - law of eq .",
