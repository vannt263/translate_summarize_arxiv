    "the traditional cosmology has been revolutionized by modern observational techniques in distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations ( bennett et al . 2003 ; spergel et al . 2003 , 2006 ) , and large - scale structure ( lss ) ( tegmark et al .",
    "these observations suggest that the composition of the universe may consist of an extra component such as dark energy or the equations governing gravity may need a variation to explain the acceleration of the universe at the present epoch .",
    "sne ia have been considered as astronomical standard candles and used to measure the geometry and dynamics of the universe . however , since it is difficult to observe sne ia at redshift @xmath7 , this measurement has been carried out only for the @xmath8 universe .",
    "recently , it was shown that grbs may be complementary to the sn cosmology for three reasons .",
    "first , grbs are the most powerful explosive events at cosmological distances and in particular long - duration grbs originate from the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "so grbs would be detectable out to very high redshifts when the core collapse of the first stars occur ( ciardi & loeb 2000 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , the farthest burst detected so far is grb 050904 , which is at @xmath9 ( kawai et al .",
    "thus , grbs could provide a much longer arm for measuring changes in the slope of the hubble diagram than do sne ia .",
    "second , gamma - ray photons suffer from no dust extinction when they propagate to us , so the observed gamma - ray flux is a direct measurement of the prompt emission energy .",
    "third , there have been extensive discussions on relations between the spectral and temporal properties and some of these relations have been shown to be promising standard candles for cosmography .",
    "schaefer ( 2003 ) derived the luminosity distances of 9 grbs with known redshifts by using two quantities ( the spectral lag and the variability ) as luminosity calibrators and gave a constraint on the mass density @xmath10 .",
    "ghirlanda et al . ( 2004a ) found a tight relation between collimation - corrected energy @xmath11 and the local - observer peak energy @xmath12 ( i.e. , the so - called ghirlanda relation ) .",
    "this relation may be physically understood as due to the viewing angle effect of an annular jet ( levinson & eichler 2005 ) or comptonization of the thermal radiation flux that is advected from the base of an outflow ( rees & & mszros 2005 ; thompson et al .",
    "2006 ) . assuming that some physical explanation ( e.g. , the understandings mentioned above ) comes into existence , dai , liang & xu ( 2004 ) used the ghirlanda relation to constrain the cosmological parameters and dark energy .",
    "since then , a lot of work in this so - called _ grb cosmology _ field has been published ( ghirlanda et al .",

    "schaefer ( 2007 ) complied 69 grbs to make simultaneous uses of five luminosity indicators , which are relations of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . here the time lag ( @xmath46 ) is the time shift between the hard and soft light curves , @xmath47 is the luminosity of a grb , the variability @xmath48 of a burst denotes whether its light curve is spiky or smooth and @xmath48 can be obtained by calculating the normalized variance of an observed light curve around a smoothed version of that light curve ( fenimore & ramirez- ruiz 2000 ) , @xmath22 is the peak energy in the @xmath49 spectrum , @xmath50 is the collimation - corrected energy of a grb , and the minimum rise time ( @xmath51 ) in the gamma - ray light curve is the shortest time over which the light curve rises by half of the peak flux of the pulse .",

    "the acoustic signatures in the large - scale clustering of galaxies can also be used to constrain cosmological parameters and dark energy by detection of a peak in the correlation function of luminous red galaxies in the sdss ( eisenstein et al . 2005 ) .",

    "moreover , assuming the gas mass fraction is constant in cosmic time , sasaki ( 1996 ) showed that the @xmath82 measurements of clusters of galaxies at different redshifts also provide an efficient way to constrain other cosmological parameters decribing the geometry of the universe .",
    "this is based on the fact that the measured @xmath82 values for each cluster of galaxies depend on the assumed angular diameter distances to the sources as @xmath83 .",

    "<S> it has been widely shown that the cosmological parameters and dark energy can be constrained by using data from type - ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the x - ray gas mass fraction in clusters , and the linear growth rate of perturbations at @xmath0 as obtained from the 2df galaxy redshift survey . recently , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have also been argued to be promising standard candles for cosmography . in this paper , we present constraints on the cosmological parameters and dark energy by combining a recent grb sample including 69 events with the other cosmological probes . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find that for the @xmath1cdm cosmology this combination makes the constraints stringent and the best fit is close to the flat universe . </S>",
    "<S> second , we fit the flat cardassian expansion model and find that this model is consistent with the @xmath1cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> third , we present constraints on several two - parameter dark energy models and find that these models are also consistent with the @xmath1cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we reconstruct the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath2 and the deceleration parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the acceleration could have started at a redshift from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in the transition redshift is due to different dark energy models that we adopt . </S>",
    "<S> the most stringent constraint on @xmath2 lies in the redshift range @xmath6 . </S>"
