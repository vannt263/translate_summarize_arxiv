    "particularly the hadron - resonance gas ( hrg ) model has been quite successful in describing the hadron multiplicities data in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite , possibly with additional introduction of parameters to regulate deviations from full chemical equilibrium  @xcite .    in its simplest version",

    "has to take into account the attractive and repulsive interactions between hadrons . in this work",
    "we study the influence of short - range repulsive interactions between hadrons on thermal fits to hadron yield data .",
    "the repulsive interactions between hadrons are modeled via eigenvolume ( ev ) correction of the van der waals type @xcite . for a multi - component case",
    "there is more than a single way to model the eigevolume corrections . in our analysis",
    "we use two different formulations : the `` diagonal '' eigenvolume hrg model from  @xcite , and the `` crossterms '' ev model introduced in @xcite  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for technical details ) .",
    "the `` diagonal '' model is simpler but it is not consistent with the 2nd order virial expansion of the equation of state of hard spheres .",
    "the `` crossterms '' model , on the other hand , while technically more involved , is consistent with that expansion .    in our analysis",
    "we include the established strange and non - strange hadrons listed in the particle data tables  @xcite , along with their decay branching ratios .",
    "this includes mesons up to @xmath0 and ( anti)baryons up to @xmath1 .",
    "the finite width of the resonances is taken into account by adding the additional integration over their breit - wigner shapes .",
    "the feed - down from strong and electromagnetic decays of the unstable resonances to the total hadron yields is included in the standard way . the full chemical equilibrium assumed in this work , i.e. we do not consider here possible under- or over - saturation of the light and/or strange quarks which improves the data description but also introduces additional parameters  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "first a bag - model inspired parametrization with the hadron eigenvolume proportional to its mass through a bag - like constant is employed , i.e. @xmath3 such eigenvolume parametrization had been obtained for the heavy hagedorn resonances , and was used to describe their thermodynamics  @xcite , their effect on particle yield ratios  @xcite , and compared to lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "the ev - hrg model fits are using the hadron yield data of the na49 collaboration , which include @xmath4 yields of charged pions , charged kaons , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and , if available , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , measured in most central pb+pb collisions at @xmath11 , and @xmath12  gev  @xcite .",

    "figure @xmath17a depicts the regions in the @xmath18-@xmath2 plane where the fit quality of na49 data in the ev model is better than in the non - interacting hrg .",
    "the location of the fit minima within non - interacting hrg are shown by diamonds , and are consistent with the systematics established in numerous previous studies . at all",
    "five na49 energies wide regions of improved @xmath16 values are observed at high temperatures and chemical potentials . at given bombarding energy , for a given set of radii ,",
    "the ev hrg model fits do not just yield a single @xmath19 pair , but a whole range of @xmath19 pairs , each with similarly good fit quality .",
    "these pairs form a valley in the @xmath19 plane along a line of nearly constant entropy per baryon , @xmath20 .",
    "we also show the energy dependence of values of @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "@xmath17b ) . the @xmath20 , extracted at different energies , is a robust observable : it is almost independent of the details of the modeling of the ev interactions and of the specific @xmath19 values obtained .",
    "we also consider parameterization where all mesons are assumed to be point - like and where all baryons have a fixed hard - core radius @xmath21  fm .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite this parameterization yields a good description of lattice data on the pressure at least up to @xmath22  mev .",
    "it was also shown in  @xcite that it leads to an irregular @xmath16 profile of thermal fit to alice hadron yield data with wide double minimum structure in the 155 - 210  mev temperature range . here",
    "we investigate how inclusion of light nuclei influences the fit .",
    "for that we consider the 0 - 10% centrality alice data which has a rich amount of data regarding yields of light nuclei .",

    "the addition of light nuclei requires additional assumptions regarding their eigenvolumes .",
    "first we consider only addition of ( anti)deuterons and compare two cases : ( 1 ) deuteron has same eigenvolume as baryons , i.e. @xmath26  fm ; ( 2 ) deuteron has a twice larger eigenvolume compared to baryons , i.e. @xmath27  fm .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    if deuterons are assumed to have same eigenvolume as protons then the @xmath16 profile has a regular structure with a minimum at @xmath33  mev .",
    "thus , even though inclusion of light nuclei may be questionable in general , it would seem that inclusion of deuterons into thermal fit would stabilise them with regards to the modeling of eigenvolume corrections .",
    "this conclusion , however , is illusory .",
    "changing deuteron eigenvolume to a physically more motivated value equal to twice that of proton one gets a very different @xmath16 profile : a two - minimum structure in a wide 155 - 210  mev temperature range , with improved fit quality at global minimum .",
    "this change is attributed to a larger suppression of ( anti)deuteron yield at higher temperatures due to larger eigenvolume .",
    "it is remarkable that fit can be so sensitive to the properties of only single particle species .",
    "similarly , the inclusion of yields of @xmath24he and @xmath25h does not help to stabilise the fit , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteron]b .",
    "this is so despite the remarkably large number of degrees of freedom @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore conclude that introduction of light nuclei into thermal fits leads to a further destabilisation of the fit as it requires non - trivial assumptions regarding their eigenvolumes .",
    "it is shown that thermal fits are very sensitive to the details of the modeling of the eigenvolume interactions . at given collision energy , the ev hrg model fits do not just yield a single @xmath19 pair , but a whole range of @xmath19 pairs , each with similarly good fit quality .",
    "the entropy per baryon , on the other hand , appears to be a robust observable : its extracted value depends weakly on the modeling of hadron eigenvolumes .",
    "finally , we explore the effect of including light nuclei into thermal fits and , somewhat surprisingly , find that results are even more sensitive to the assumptions regarding their eigenvolume parameters .",
