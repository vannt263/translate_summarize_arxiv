    "we report a corresponding doppler signal for kepler-68b , but the radial velocity ( rv ) measurements provide only an upper limit to the mass of kepler-68c , that is physically uninteresting .",
    "we describe investigation of false - positive scenarios with a blender  analysis @xcite as described in section  [ sec : blender ] .",
    "the spectroscopy and asteroseismology yield stellar properties discussed in section  [ sec : star ] .",
    "the stellar density , mass , and radius permit a detailed analysis of the light curve and doppler measurements , to give planet parameters , described in section  [ sec : planet ] .",
    "we also discuss the properties of kepler-68b  from the standpoint of theoretical models in section  [ sec : planet ] , especially regarding the planet s composition .",
    "its placement in a mass - radius diagram suggests a composition of large amounts of rock and significant amounts of volatiles to yield the observed density of 3 g @xmath5 .    with the changing status of stars during the course of the _ kepler mission _ ,",
    "as planet candidates are discovered and confirmed as planets , the nomenclature used and recognized by diverse analysis groups evolves .",
    "the star studied here is located at @xmath19 = @xmath20 , @xmath21 = @xmath22   and in the kepler input catalog ( kic ) was designated kic 11295426 .",
    "the previously existing 2mass i d was j19240775 + 4902249 .",
    "the kepler object of interest ( koi ) name was given when it appeared in the @xcite exoplanet candidate list as koi00246 , or the more commonly appearing koi-246 as used herein .",
    "koi numbers were assigned per convention as : koi-246.01 with initial detection of the 5.4 day candidate transits , koi-246.20 for the candidate detected based on non-_kepler _  input , and then koi-246.02 for the second transiting planet candidate at 9.6 days . with validation and confirmation of planets",
    "the star was given its final moniker , kepler-68 , and the planets kepler-68b , c , d  from kois 246.01 , 246.02 and 246.20 respectively .",
    "the _ kepler _  instrument is described in @xcite and @xcite while an overview of performance is presented in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we report the results from using 12 quarters of kepler data .",
    "the standard pipeline reduction of the photometry first yielded a transit signal with a period of 5.40 d , consistent with a planet with a size of approximately 2.5 @xmath3@xcite .",
    "subsequent searches of the light curve alerted the _ kepler _",
    "team to a second transit signal with a period of @xmath179.61 d and approximately earth size . thus , the _ kepler _  photometry and pipeline reduction from kepler-68  reveals two periodic transit signals consistent with planets , hereafter called kepler-68b  and kepler-68c .",
    "independent transit searches of the _ kepler _  photometry have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite who also find evidence for kepler-68b  and kepler-68c   with the same period and transit depth within uncertainties . for kepler-68c@xcite",
    "find a period of 9.60538 @xmath23 0.00026 d and a planet radius of 0.86 @xmath3 .",
    "they also find a single transit from a possible third planet with a transit duration of @xmath178 hr implying a period of 970 @xmath23 50 days , and planet size about 2.4 @xmath3 .",
    "thus there is a possibility that a third planet transits kepler-68 .",
    "_  observations of kepler-68   are ongoing , including acquisition of short cadence data .",
    "inspection of data through q13 has not shown further evidence for the several hundred day planet candidate . at a period of nearly 1000 days",
    "the next transit would not be expected until q16 in early 2013 .",
    "raw flux light curves for each quarter @xcite are corrected for systematic errors , detrended , and stitched together to form contiguous time series , and are then searched for transit signals @xcite .",
    "we remove systematic errors , outliers and intra - quarter discontinuities by co - trending against the photometry of other stars in the vicinity of kepler-68 using the pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) pipeline module as described in @xcite , with updates as per @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : q4phot ] shows the raw ( sap_flux , the result of simple aperture photometry ) and corrected ( pdcsap_flux ) flux time series for kepler-68  during a representative quarter ( q4 ) . the largest remaining systematic errors in the pdc - map ( @xcite ; @xcite ) processed data are minor offsets following thermal transients after monthly pointing changes to telemeter data to the ground ( very small for q4 )",
    ". the slow variation with a period of @xmath1750 days and amplitude of 0.0003 in this figure could either be intrinsic to the star , or associated with imperfect removal of long - term drifts due to image motion ( differential velocity aberration ) that is present in the raw data .",
    "it is clear that variations in kepler-68  are smaller than typical variations of the sun , consistent with the slow rotation and advanced age argued for in sections 6.1 and 6.2 respectively . after filtering out transit events , the measured relative standard deviation of the pdc - corrected",
    ", long - cadence light curve is 21 ppm per 6 hour interval ( cdpp  the formal combined differential photometric precision ",
    "see @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "an expected instrument @xmath24 photon noise is computed for each flux in the timeseries .",
    "the mean of the per ( 29.4-minute ) cadence noise estimates reported by the pipeline is 233 ppm . both raw ( simple aperture sums ) and corrected ( pdc - map ) light curves are available at the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) at the space telescope science institute .",
    "the kepler-68b  transits were identified by the transiting planet search ( tps ) pipeline module that identifies periodic reductions in flux having a duration of hours , each corresponding to a transit of a prospective planet .",
    "the algorithm is a wavelet - based , adaptive matched filter @xcite .",
    "tps then identifies a time series of single  events \" , each having an associated  single event statistic ( ses ) \" that represents the probability that a transit is present .",
    "the ses from each transit are combined into multiple event statistics ( mes ) by folding them at trial orbital periods ranging from 0.5 days to as long as half the data coverage interval .",
    "kepler-68b  was identified by tps in each quarter of data with a multiple event statistic @xmath25 .",
    "multi - quarter searching for transits was used .",
    "the transit depth , duration , period , and epoch are derived from physical modeling ( see section  [ sec : planet ] ) using all of the available data .",
    "kepler-68b  is characterized as a @xmath26  ppm dimming lasting @xmath27  hours with transit ephemeris of t[bjd]@xmath28 days .",
    "the longer - period transits of kepler-68c  were identified by non - pipeline inspections .",
    "kepler-68c  is characterized as a @xmath29  ppm dimming lasting @xmath30  hours and an ephemeris t[bjd]@xmath31 days .",
    "signals that mimic planet transits are also found by tps . all",
    " threshold crossing events \" identified by tps are subjected to assessment of standard vetting products that allow separate disposition of clear false positives before bestowing the koi moniker .",
    "most false positives can be identified by judicious assessment of the quality of the transit - planet model fit to the photometry and by searching for astrometric displacements of the photocenter between times out of transit and in - transit .",
    "true transiting planets should exhibit photometry that is well fit by a transiting planet model and they should show little , if any , astrometric displacement during transit ( depending on neighboring stars ) . such  data validation \" techniques are described in @xcite and in @xcite . both kepler-68b  and kepler-68c  passed all such tests , conferring koi planet candidate status for both of them , as will be further discussed next .",
    "figure  [ fig : vett01 ] shows several representations of data relevant to judging the kepler-68b  signal . in some early quarters",
    "the optimal aperture did not encompass all of the flux , especially for saturated targets like kepler-68 .",
    "this leads to suppressed variation and is the reason we did not use the q3 data .",
    "the upper panel shows the phase folded light curve for kepler-68b , after de - trending and subtraction of the kepler-68c  transit signal .",
    "a common type of false positive is a background eclipsing binary blended with the target star ; in such cases a secondary eclipse is often seen .",
    "no evidence of a secondary eclipse is seen here , nor turned up in automated searches .",
    "the lower left panel shows that the phase folded data for kepler-68b  are fit very well by our transit model .",
    "another signature of a possible false positive associated with an eclipsing binary ( either the target star itself as a grazing eclipse or as a blended background system ) relies on searching for subtle differences of depth between alternate transits  a binary with twice the listed period and primary and secondary eclipses of slightly unequal depths are easily seen in data of this quality . from all aspects of lightcurve inspection kepler-68b  is entirely clean .",
    "figure  [ fig : vett02 ] addresses kepler-68c  showing analogous vetting products for the time series as figure  [ fig : vett01 ] , but with the transit signal of kepler-68b  subtracted out .",
    "again , there is no clear evidence for a secondary eclipse , or depth differences for alternately averaged transits , either of which would be suggestive of a false positive interpretation .",
    "the question of a secondary eclipse feature will , however , be explored at depth in the blender  context in section 5 .",
    "this transit , that is only @xmath1760% as deep as a true earth analog , obviously appears at high signal - to - noise in the phase folded data and is well fit by our planet transit model .",
    "centroid analyses based on assessing the in- and out - of - transit signal positions can be particularly powerful , ( e.g. see @xcite for application to kepler-10b ) . the difference of average images taken out - of - transit , minus a similar average of images taken during transit for an unsaturated target yields a psf at the inherent source position ( coincident within errors with the target star for a clean candidate ) .",
    "since kepler-68  is saturated , the centroid analyses are much less discerning with the inherent loss of spatial information following saturation . for a strongly saturated target changes of flux",
    "are concentrated at the end of bleed columns , while the central pixels in the bleed trail remain , well , saturated .",
    "the kic shows the location of a fainter ( magnitude not available in kic , but derived below in section 4.2.1 from ao imaging ) star offset by about 11   in such a way that it is almost precisely in the detector column direction from kepler-68 . in most quarters kepler-68  is roughly centered on a pixel in the column direction leading to bleeding that encompasses this secondary star , kic 11295432 , in which circumstance using the _ kepler _  data to discern the true source of transits between the two stars is not possible . in q9 both kepler-68  and the fainter neighbor kic 11295432",
    "are nearly centered between columns , and the bleeding terminates before reaching the latter .",
    "table  [ tab : difftab ] details pixel values in both the direct out - of - transit image at the left , and for the difference images of kepler-68b  and kepler-68c  in the central and right blocks for q9 data .",
    "( q1 and q5 with the telescope at the same orientation also possess this feature , but the kepler-68c  difference images , which in the best of circumstance are low signal - to - noise , were unstable for these quarters . ) the difference images for both kepler-68b  and kepler-68c  show maxima in the terminal saturation pixels , rather than in the pixel containing kic 11295432 .",
    "this proves that kic 11295432 can not be the source for either set of transits .",
    "saturated pixels in these quarters span a rectangle of 2@xmath324 pixels , or 8@xmath32 16   for which centroid analysis does not rule out background contaminating sources .",
    "deviations in the difference image along the row direction for saturated images likely result from imperfect correction for lde ( local detector electronics ) undershoot @xcite , a signal - dependent offset to negative values along rows traced to an amplifier in the _ kepler _  electronics .",
    "the high resolution imaging discussed in section 4.2 will provide the primary constraints on potential background objects , which if these objects were eclipsing binaries could be the source of false positives .    in figure",
    "[ fig : monoevent ] we present vetting evidence to further investigate the veracity of the single transit of presumed long period reported in @xcite and shown in their fig .",
    "3 . the detrending of raw _ kepler _  data adopted by @xcite results in a @xmath178 hour wide intensity drop that is adequately fit with a standard transit model . in the raw lc ( simple aperture photometry  no detrending ) _ kepler _  data their event is easily seen at bjd - 2455000 = 403.2 . however , the raw lc data shows a drop of intensity across this event of about 0.0001 which may be easily seen by drawing linear fits to the data before or after the event .",
    "such behavior is commonly seen with sudden pixel sensitivity losses associated with radiation damage to a single pixel ( see , e.g. discussion from discovery in hst acs data by @xcite and @xcite for presence in _ kepler _  data )  and ultimate recovery of most , but not all of the depressed sensitivity .",
    "such sensitivity drops can be particularly difficult to tell from transits in lc data which blur both sudden ( spurious ) drops , and short ingress / egress events .",
    "the spurious signature may be more easily seen in short cadence data as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : monoevent ]  here the event looks more like a sudden sensitivity loss and recovery , than a transit .",
    "note that the two occurrences of kepler-68b  transits about one day from both ends show symmetric responses about the transit centers , while the single - event behavior is quite asymmetric with shape characteristic of a pixel sensitivity loss .",
    "the middle panel shows that the pipeline pdc - map treatment completely removes any suggestion of the single - event transit while nicely preserving the real events from kepler-68b .",
    "these considerations do not prove the single - event transit as an instrument systematic false positive , but this interpretation is favored by us .",
    "definitive proof would come if a difference image analysis across transit could isolate the intensity drop to one pixel , while the stellar signal spans several pixels .",
    "we tested for this , but were only able to show that the source is within the set of saturated pixels for kepler-68 , leaving open an astrophysical source .",
    "kepler-68  was identified as having a candidate planet in late 2009 , prompting follow - up observations to confirm and characterize the planet , and to secure more precise stellar parameters than are available in the kepler input catalog .",
    "we were particularly interested in checking for signs of a nearby eclipsing binary star system that might masquerade as a planet .",
    "we carried out spectroscopy of the host star kepler-68  ( section  [ sec : recon ] ) and high spatial resolution imaging to identify nearby stars in the photometric aperture ( section 4.2 ) . upon passing those gates",
    ", we carried out high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) echelle spectroscopy with and without an iodine cell to measure atmospheric stellar parameters , magnetic activity , absorption line shape changes with time , and to make precise doppler measurements .",
    "as described below , these follow - up observations revealed no evidence of a nearby eclipsing binary for either transiting planet , and they provide measurements and constraints on the masses of the transiting planets . in addition , a previously unknown non - transiting planet was revealed as discussed in section  [ sec : rv ] .",
    "bisector analyses of the high resolution spectroscopy are presented in section 4.4 .",
    "we obtained _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "photometry through transits of kepler-68b  and present results in section 4.5 .",
    "two reconnaissance spectra were obtained with the tull coude spectrograph of the mcdonald observatory 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope on the nights of 25 march 2010 and 28 march 2010 , and a third at the tres echelle spectrograph of the tillinghast 1.5 m telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins , also on the night of 25 march 2010 .",
    "these high spectral resolution , low signal / noise spectra showed no convincing evidence for radial velocity variability at the 0.2kms@xmath33 level , and no hints of any contaminating spectra .",
    "these spectra were cross - correlated against a library of synthetic model stellar spectra as described by @xcite in order to derive basic stellar parameters to compare with the kepler input catalog ( kic ) values .",
    "these spectra were in excellent agreement , and yielded @xmath34k , @xmath35 , and rotational velocity less than 4kms@xmath33 .",
    "the height of the cross - correlation peaks ranged from 0.93 to 0.96 , indicating an excellent match with the library spectra .",
    "this spectroscopy suggests that kepler-68  is a sun - like , slowly rotating main sequence star , in support of the planetary interpretation for the transit events .",
    "there is always a possibility , especially for bright stars of high enough proper motion for old plates to reveal the background distribution of faint stars in the current epoch .",
    "inspection of 1953 and 1991 sky survey plates shows that this does not work for kepler-68   the proper motion is far too small .",
    "near - infrared adaptive optics imaging of kepler-68  was obtained with the 6.5 m mmt telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins and the arizona infrared imager and echelle spectrograph ( aries ) .",
    "the kepler-68  imaging was obtained on the night of 2010 may 5 ( ut ) using the f/30 mode with a field of view of 20@xmath32 20   and a resolution of 002085 per pixel . the ao system guided on the primary target .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath36 band combined image was 0123 , while the @xmath37 band provided 0112 imaging .",
    "a four - point dither pattern was used with a total of 16 images in each band .",
    "further details of the mmt - aries high resolution imaging for _ kepler _  follow - up support may be found in @xcite .",

    "the domain plotted no other sources are visible to the 5-@xmath38 depth limits as shown in figure  [ fig : highreslim ] . within the full aries field of view one additional source at 6.1 and 5.7 magnitudes fainter in @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "respectively was identified . using the 2mass @xmath36 and @xmath37 magnitudes for kepler-68  of 8.974 and 8.587",
    "leads to estimates of 15.07 and 14.29 respectively for the companion . using the transformations in appendix",
    "a of @xcite leads to a @xmath39 = 17.0 @xmath23 0.4 , or a @xmath21-magnitude of 7.0 @xmath23 0.4 with respect to kepler-68  in the _ kepler _  bandpass .",
    "this ao identified source also shows up clearly in available ukirt @xmath36 direct imaging @xcite and corresponds to the star kic 11295432 , which does not have a specified @xmath39 in the kic . from a combination of _ kepler _  data",
    "centroid consideration ( section 3 ) , and the aries ao , and ukirt data , to roughly the exclusion limits reached in figure  [ fig : highreslim ] , no other sources exist to relevant larger radii as well .",
    "speckle imaging of kepler-68  was obtained on the night of 2010 june 20 ut using the two - color speckle camera at the wisconsin indiana yale noao ( wiyn ) 3.5-m telescope on kitt peak .",
    "the speckle camera simultaneously obtained 1000 40 msec images in two filters : @xmath40 ( 5620/400 ) and @xmath41 ( 6920/400 ) .",
    "these data were reduced and processed to produce a final reconstructed speckle image for each filter .",

    "the details of the two - color speckle camera are presented in @xcite for application in the _ kepler _  follow - up program .",
    "the speckle data allow detection of a companion star within the approximately @xmath42 arcsec box centered on the target .",
    "the speckle imaging can detect , or rule out , companions between 0.05 arcsec and 1.5 arcsec from kepler-68 .",
    "we found no companion star within the speckle image to the detection limits shown in figure  [ fig : highreslim ] . when high quality near - ir ao imaging is available , as in this case , the wiyn speckle imaging is largely redundant providing unique sensitivity for a small angular separation range due to its superior fwhm of 0053  a factor of two sharper , but generally shallower than the mmt ao imaging .",
    "we obtained 52 high resolution spectra of kepler-68  between 2010 july 19 and 2012 aug 12 using the hires spectrometer on the keck  i 10-m telescope @xcite .",
    "we configured the spectrometer , took observations , and reduced the spectra with the same method used on thousands of nearby fgkm stars @xcite .",
    "this technique yields a doppler precision of 1.0 - 1.5 @xmath43  for stars as faint as 14th magnitude ( v band ) , depending on spectral type and rotational @xmath44 .",
    "the hires fiber - feed was not used for these observations .",
    "an iodine cell was used to superimpose iodine lines on the stellar spectrum , providing empirical information for each exposure and each wavelength about the instantaneous wavelength scale and instrumental profile of the spectrometer .",
    "the observations were made with the `` c2 decker '' entrance aperture which projects to @xmath45 , giving a resolving power of about 60,000 at 5500  and enabling sky subtraction ( typical seeing is @xmath46 ) .",
    "the average exposure was 11 minutes , giving a signal - to - noise ratio per pixel of 200 .",
    "the raw ccd images were reduced in the standard way , including the subtraction of background sky counts ( mostly from moonlight ) at each wavelength just above and below the stellar spectrum .",
    "we used doppler analysis with the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the internal doppler errors ( the weighted uncertainty in the mean of 400 spectral segments ) are typically 1.0 - 1.5 @xmath43  .",
    "our experience with hundreds of g - type main sequence stars shows that the actual errors are larger than the internal errors by @xmath171.5 @xmath43  for such stars .",
    "thus , we added 1.5 @xmath43  in quadrature to the internal uncertainties to yield our estimated uncertainty in the rv .",
    "the resulting velocities and uncertainties are given in table  [ tab : radtab ] and shown in figure  [ fig : rv_time ] as a function of time .",
    "the error bars include the internal doppler errors and an assumed jitter of 1.5 @xmath43  .",
    "the center of mass velocity relative to the solar system barycenter ( gamma velocity ) for kepler-68  is @xmath47 km s@xmath33 ( table  [ tab : systemparams ] ) .",
    "this is a typical radial velocity for a star in the galactic disk , indicative of a middle - aged disk star .",
    "the near solar metallicity ( section  [ sec : spectparam ] ) , @xmath48}={\\ensuremath{+0.12 \\pm 0.074}}$ ] , magnetic activity ( section  [ sec : spectparam ] ) , and asteroseismic age , @xmath49 gyr ( section  [ sec : astero ] ) , also suggest galactic disk membership .",
    "the primary signal from the rvs is the @xmath50 = 19.9 @xmath23 0.75 m s@xmath33 variation with a period of 580 @xmath23 15 days as shown first in figure  [ fig : rv_time ] , and phased in figure  [ fig : rv3pan ] . this clear rv signature , coupled with the lack of bisector variations discussed in section 4.4 provides discovery and confirmation of the jovian - scale outer planet  kepler-68d .",
    "the velocities phased to the photometric period of kepler-68bin figure  [ fig : rv3pan ] show a clear , continuous , and nearly sinusoidal variation consistent with a nearly circular orbit of a planetary companion .",
    "note that the 7 magnitude ( see sections 3 and 4.2.1 ) fainter companion kic 11295432 blended into the _ kepler _  photometry does not fall within the hires slit and can not be the source of kepler-68b  radial velocity variations .",
    "the lack of any discontinuities in the phased velocity plot argues against a background eclipsing binary star as the explanation .",
    "such a binary with a period of 5.4 d would have orbital semi - amplitudes of tens of kilometers per second , so large that the spectral lines would completely separate from each other , and separate from the lines of the main star .",
    "such breaks in the spectral - line blends would cause discontinuities in the velocity variation , which are not seen here .",
    "thus , the chance that the 5.4 d periodicity exhibited independently in both the photometry and velocities might be caused by an eclipsing binary seems small .",
    "precision doppler measurements are used to constrain the mass of kepler-68b  as discussed in section  [ sec : planet ] .",
    "the absence of a doppler signal for kepler-68c  is used to compute an upper limit to the mass under the planet interpretation .      from the keck spectra",
    ", we computed a mean line profile and the corresponding mean line bisector .",
    "time - varying line asymmetries are tracked by measuring the bisector spans  the velocity difference between the top and bottom of the mean line bisector  for each spectrum @xcite .",
    "when radial velocity variations are the result of a blended spectrum between a star and an eclipsing binary , we expect the bisectors to reveal a phase - modulated line asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the bisector spans in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : rv_time ] show no correlated variation with the radial velocities and have a scatter of 7.8 @xmath43 , which is significantly less than the semi - amplitude of kepler-68d .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the bisector measurements are larger than the semi - amplitude of the two smaller planets in the system and a bisector analysis is thus inconclusive with respect to kepler-68b  and kepler-68c .",
    "kepler-68b  was observed during two transits with _ warm - spitzer_/irac @xcite at 4.5  ( program i d 60028 ) .",
    "the observations occurred on ut 2010 december 27 and on ut 2011 january 7 .",
    "the visits lasted 7.6  hours .",
    "the data were gathered in subarray mode ( @xmath51 pixels ) with an exposure time of 2  s per image which yielded 15680 images per visit .",
    "the images used are the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) delivered by the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "these files are corrected for dark current , flat - fielding , detector non - linearity and converted into flux units .",
    "the method we used to produce photometric time series from the images is described in @xcite .",
    "we first discard the first half - hour of observations , which are affected by a significant telescope jitter before stabilization . to facilitate the evaluation of the photometric errors",
    ", we then convert the pixel intensities to electrons using the information given in the detector gain and exposure time provided in the fits headers .",
    "we convert to utc - based bjd following the procedure developed by @xcite .",
    "we correct for transient pixels in each individual image using a 20-point sliding median filter of the pixel intensity versus time .",
    "we find the centroid position of the stellar point spread function ( psf ) and perform aperture photometry using a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath52  pixels on individual bcd images ; we adopt the radius which provides the smallest errors .",

    "the weighted mean of these two values provides a transit depth of 455 @xmath23 50 ppm .",
    "the value for the first visit is in excellent agreement with the _ kepler _  depth of 346 ppm suggesting that the radius - ratio of the candidate kepler-68bto its host star is a wavelength independent function , in agreement with a dark planetary object .",
    "however , visit two is 3 @xmath38 from the _ kepler _  value .",
    "two possibilities for this behavior , other than the small statistical probability of two such discrepant values legitimately following from the same underlying distribution , are : ( 1 ) a physically different depth in the two epochs for the transit , and ( 2 ) an inconsistency in one of the _ spitzer _  epochs that we have failed to uncover . to investigate the first possibility we identified the position of the two _ spitzer _",
    "epochs relative to _ kepler _  coverage . alas ,",
    "despite the excellent overall duty cycle with _ kepler _  in excess of 90% , both epochs fell into the longest downtime experienced to date with _",

    "we have no data with which to challenge the hypothesis that the two epochs really do have different depths , as could happen if there is an as yet unclaimed transiting planet that overlapped with the deeper _ spitzer _  transit of kepler-68b .",
    "we have not uncovered direct evidence for an inconsistency in the data quality or analyses sufficient to explain the discrepancy in depths of the two _ spitzer _",
    "however , we do note that the scatter evident in figure  [ fig : spitzerlightcurves ] for the anomalously deep transit is much larger than we normally encounter .",
    "given the perfect agreement of one _ spitzer _",
    "visit in reproducing the transit depth seen in the optical , the radial velocity confirmation documented in the previous section , and a strong blender  validation to be presented in section 5 the case for the planet interpretation of kepler-68b  remains strong .",
    "in this section we examine the possibility that the transit signals seen in the _ kepler _  photometry of kepler-68  are the result of contamination of the light of the target by an eclipsing object along the same line of sight .",
    "we begin with the more difficult signal kepler-68c , which would correspond to an earth - size planet .      in the absence of a dynamical confirmation of the planetary nature of the kepler-68c  signal from either a doppler detection or a transit timing variation ( ttv ) signature",
    ", we proceed here with a probabilistic `` validation '' .",
    "in essence , we seek to demonstrate that the signal is much more likely to be caused by a bona - fide transiting planet than by a false positive ( or `` blend '' ) . for this we applied the blender  procedure , which has been described previously @xcite and used to validate a number of other _ kepler _  planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we refer the reader to these works for full details of the method .",
    "briefly , we performed a systematic exploration of the different types of false positives that can mimic the signal , by generating large numbers of synthetic blend light curves over a wide range of parameters and comparing each of them with the _ kepler _  photometry in a @xmath60 sense .",
    "the photometry we used for the validation is the de - trended short - cadence time series ( one month from q2 , plus the seven quarters of q5q11  886,638 measurements ) , which provides stronger constraints on the shape of the transit than the long cadence data , as shown later .",
    "we rejected blends that result in light curves inconsistent with the _ kepler_observations .",
    "we then estimated the frequency of the remaining blends by taking into account all available observational constraints from the follow - up observations mentioned above .",
    "finally we compared this frequency with the expected frequency of true planets ( planet `` prior '' ) to derive the odds ratio .",
    "the types of false positives we considered include eclipsing systems falling within the _ kepler _  aperture that are either in the background or foreground , or that are physically associated with the target in a hierarchical triple configuration .",
    "we allowed the object producing the eclipses to be either a star or a planet . to compute the blend frequencies we used informed estimates of the number density of stars in the background from the besancon galactic structure model of @xcite , rates of occurrence of eclipsing binaries in the _ kepler _  field from the work of @xcite , and frequencies of planets involved in blends based on the catalog of planet candidates ( kois ) of @xcite , which was constructed using observations from q1 to q6 .",
    "the same catalog was also used to estimate the planet prior .",
    "this list of kois is bound to contain some fraction of false positives ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is also likely incomplete mainly due to the difficulty in detecting shallow signals especially with long periods .",
    "consequently we have applied corrections for these effects following a monte carlo procedure described by @xcite , both in computing the blend frequencies and also for the planet prior .",
    "the observational constraints used to further reduce the number of blends included the following : ( a ) the color of the star as reported in the kic @xcite , which allows us to rule out any simulated blends resulting in a combined color that is significantly redder or bluer than the target ; ( b ) limits from the centroid motion analysis on the angular separation of companions that could produce the signal ( section  3 ) ; ( c ) brightness and angular separation limits from high - resolution adaptive optics and speckle imaging ( section  4.2 ) ; ( d ) limits on the brightness of unresolved companions from high - resolution spectroscopy ( section  4.1 ) . for eclipsing systems physically associated with the target we considered also dynamical stability constraints in hierarchical triple configurations @xcite .",
    "the blender  simulations for kepler-68c  rule out all false positive scenarios involving eclipsing binaries physically associated with the target , as the predicted light curves invariably have the wrong shape to match a planetary transit . for the scenarios involving eclipsing binaries that are in the background or foreground we find a blend frequency of @xmath61 , and for those in which larger planets transit background stars we estimate a much smaller frequency of @xmath62 .",
    "hierarchical triples ( a larger planet transiting a stellar companion to the target ) contribute a frequency of @xmath63 .",
    "the total blend frequency is thus @xmath64 .",
    "an illustration of the constraints on false positives resulting from blender  as well as those from the follow - up observations is given in figure  [ fig : blender246.02 ] .",
    "an estimate of the planet prior may be obtained by dividing the number of known planets of similar size as kepler-68c  from @xcite by the total number of main - sequence _ kepler _  targets observed during q1q6 , which is 138,253 .",
    "we find 71 kois that are in the same ( 3@xmath38 ) radius range as the putative planet in kepler-68c , of which we expect 9.4 to be false positives , following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "we also expect such shallow ( @xmath1750 ppm ) transit signals to be detectable around only about 9.7% of all _ kepler_targets , which we use to correct for incompleteness .",
    "we compute the planet prior as @xmath65 .",
    "this _ a priori _ planet frequency is @xmath66 times larger than the estimated blend frequency , from which we conclude that kepler-68c  is validated as a true planet with a very high degree of confidence .    in the above calculations we have not explicitly taken into consideration the period of the signal , which may be an important factor for small candidates such as kepler-68c  because such signals are relatively rare in the koi list of @xcite",
    "this may in principle influence both the planet prior and the blend frequencies we have just described , given that the latter also draw on the koi list to estimate the rate of occurrence of larger planets involved in blends .",
    "therefore , instead of allowing eclipsing binaries and transiting planets with any orbital period for the blend frequency calculations , we repeated the analysis with the more realistic approach of accepting only blends with periods near the measured period of kepler-68c  ( within a factor of two ) .",
    "we did the same when computing the planet prior , for consistency .",
    "the total blend frequency is reduced in this way by about a factor of five , but the new planet prior is only 1.5 times smaller , resulting in a larger net odds ratio of @xmath174300 that provides for an even stronger validation than before .",
    "the above calculations neglect the fact that koi-246.02 was found around a target that has a statistically validated transiting planet , koi-246.01 = kepler-68b .",
    "the planet priors used were averaged between single and multi - planet systems .",
    "actual planet priors are about 30% smaller for single planets and more than an order of magnitude larger for multiple planets @xcite .",
    "the presence of a known planet also increases the prior for physically - associated blends , but by a smaller factor .",
    "the numbers quoted above for the likelihood of false positives are four times higher for background blends than for physically - associated blends , so when multiplicity of the system is accounted for , the odds ratios against blends quoted above are increased by roughly an order of magnitude .    as an interesting test of the value of short cadence versus long cadence data for false positive discrimination , we repeated the calculations with the long - cadence time series ( q1q2 , q4q11 , 34,556 measurements ) including the period cut described above .",
    "we find an odds ratio of approximately 1500 , about three times lower than when using short cadence , but still large enough to comfortably validate the signal .",
    "therefore , at least for kepler-68c , short cadence provides a clear advantage in ruling out blends .",
    "this is likely due to the better definition of the transit shape at ingress / egress , which is often where the main differences are between model light curves for blends and the model for a true planet . in this case",
    "we find that the main improvement ( decrease ) in the blend frequencies when going from long to short cadence is in the scenarios involving hierarchical triples , with background eclipsing binary frequencies changing the least .    while in principle the above calculations provide a clear statistical validation of the kepler-68c  signal as a true planet , independently of the detection of the reflex motion of the star ( radial velocities ) , we note that some of the blend scenarios involving background eclipsing binaries yield a fit to the _ kepler _  photometry that is significantly _ better _ than that of a planet fit .",
    "this is a situation we have not encountered in previous validations of _ kepler _  candidates .",
    "the light curves of these false positive scenarios all feature a very shallow ( @xmath1710 ppm ) secondary eclipse that happens to match a similar dip present in the phase - folded photometry for kepler-68c  at phase 0.5 .",
    "this shallow dip at phase 0.5 has a formal significance of 3  4 @xmath38 , and is the primary source for these favorable false positive fits .",
    "the reality of the signal at phase 0.5 for kepler-68c  is in doubt ; were this not so claiming validation in this case would be impossible .",
    "figure  [ fig : sececlipse ] contrasts phase folded short cadence data for kepler-68c  at both the transit , and offset by half phases . in assessing the reality of this putative secondary eclipse feature we have examined the data in several ways . when averaged over widths comparable to the transit",
    "the data show a few other excursions ( both positive and negative ) to deviations as large as the phase 0.5 feature ; thus the feature is obviously not highly significant .",
    "however , other aspects of data investigation do not support a straightforward dismissal of evidence consistent with the weak , @xmath1710 ppm feature .",
    "examination of medians over the phase bins shown in figure  [ fig : sececlipse ] showed the same offsets , thus the deviation does not result simply from a small subset of the data . likewise , dividing the data into first and second halves before doing independent phase binnings shows evidence for a @xmath1710 ppm depression at phase 0.5 in both cases .",
    "in these two halves there are again other instances of deviations of comparable width and depth ; however , across the two halves the only cases lining up are those at phase 0.5 .",
    "while nothing here is convincing in terms of regarding the phase 0.5 offset as real , it is equally the case that the reality of the offset can not be excluded .",
    "we therefore took the conservative approach of allowing blender  to be influenced by the apparent negative offset at phase 0.5 , which still provides the favorable odds ratio required for formal validation of kepler-68c  as a planet .    further complicating this interpretation",
    "these data show a small degree of correlated noise , even after folding over 64 orbits of kepler-68c .",
    "after binning to 0.001 phase bins the first autocorrelation value is 0.25 , falling to zero within about 0.005 in phase .",
    "we formed simulated time series consisting only of gaussian noise , stellar oscillations , and granulation @xcite appropriate to kepler-68and found that after folding this had a similar ( although smaller ) degree of autocorrelation suggesting that inherent stellar variations may suffice to explain the modest correlated noise .",
    "the robust detection of a doppler signal at the period of kepler-68bprovides strong support for the planetary nature of that signal .",
    "there is , however , a small chance that a background eclipsing binary could mimic this spectroscopic signature of a planet ( as well as the photometric signal ) , although this possibility was convincingly argued against in section 4.3 .",
    "the precision of our bisector span measurements in section  4.4 is not quite high enough for a definite conclusion regarding this possibility , so we proceed here with a validation analysis along the lines of what was done for kepler-68c .",
    "the much deeper transit ( @xmath17350 ppm ) and higher signal - to - noise ratio of kepler-68b  result in significantly stronger constraints on the shape of the signal , and consequently in a much reduced frequency of blends that give acceptable fits to the _ kepler _  light curve .",
    "indeed , background eclipsing binaries are completely ruled out by blender , as no such scenarios yield light curves with a transit shape that matches the observations sufficiently well . and while some hierarchical triple scenarios are allowed by blender , the companion stars would all be bright enough that they would have been seen in our high - resolution spectra .",
    "the only remaining blend scenarios that are viable are those involving larger planets transiting a background or foreground star .",
    "we estimate the frequency of such blends to be @xmath67 .    to estimate the a priori likelihood of a true planet we use the fact that there are 96 candidates in the list of @xcite with a similar planetary radius as that implied by kepler-68b  ( within 3@xmath38 ) , of which an estimated 6 should be false positives",
    ". signals of this kind are expected to be detectable in 58.7% of all _ kepler_targets .",
    "the planet prior is then @xmath68 . with this",
    "we obtain an odds ratio of nearly 79,000 in favor of the planet interpretation , i.e. , a very clear validation of kepler-68b .",
    "the above results used the long - cadence time series for simplicity , and included the period cut described above .",
    "use of short cadence would likely result in an even higher odds ratio .",
    "for completeness we note that @xcite reported a false positive probability of 0.01 for kepler-68b , whereas our confidence level is orders of magnitude better .",
    "their result was based on a less sophisticated analysis , much less _ kepler _  data , and did nt make use of any of the follow - up observations that we have utilized .",
    "we did a spectral synthesis analysis using sme @xcite of one of our high resolution template spectra from keck - hires of kepler-68  to derive an effective temperature , @xmath69 k , surface gravity , @xmath70 ( cgs ) , metallicity , @xmath48}= { \\ensuremath{+0.10 \\pm 0.04}}$ ] , and @xmath71 @xmath72 .",
    "the above effective temperature was used to constrain the fundamental stellar parameters derived via asteroseismic analysis ( see section  [ sec : astero ] ) .",
    "the asteroseismology analysis gave log @xmath73 = @xmath74 which is 0.1 dex higher than the sme value .",
    "the asteroseismology value is likely superior because of the high sensitivity of the acoustic periods to stellar radius .",
    "still , the asteroseismology result depended on adopting the value of @xmath75 from sme .",
    "we recomputed the sme analysis by freezing ( adopting ) the seismology value for @xmath76 .",
    "see @xcite for a recent discussion of such iteration in the analogous context of high snr transit light - curve analysis providing the @xmath76  truth \" .",
    "this iteration yielded values of @xmath77 k , @xmath48}= { \\ensuremath{+0.12 \\pm 0.04}}$ ] , and rotational @xmath78 .",
    "the revised effective temperature was then put back into the asteroseismology calculation to further constrain the stellar radius and gravity .",
    "this iterative process converged quickly , as the @xmath79  from seismology yielded an sme value for @xmath80  that was only slightly different from the original unconstrained determination , and the asteroseismic log @xmath73 using the iterated @xmath75 remained at 4.281 .",
    "likely systematic errors on @xmath80  and [ fe / h ]  of 59 k and 0.062 dex have been derived by @xcite in comparing results across multiple spectroscopic packages for a large number of stars . adding these additional errors in quadrature with the errors quoted above results in more resonable total errors of 74 k and 0.074 dex .",
    "we measured the ca ii h&k emission @xcite , yielding a mt .",
    "wilson s value , @xmath81=0.139 and @xmath82 = -5.15 .",
    "these values suggest lower activity for kepler-68  in comparison to mean solar reported as @xmath81 = 0.178 , @xmath82 = -4.90 by @xcite and @xmath81 = 0.171 , @xmath82 = -4.96 by @xcite .",
    "our own measure of solar activity using ganymede as a proxy yielded @xmath81 = 0.164 and @xmath82 = -4.97 @xcite for 2009 august 31 when the sun was still at a low state of its cycle .",
    "thus kepler-68  is a magnetically inactive star , consistent with its low rotational rate , @xmath44= 0.5 @xmath72 .",
    "kepler-68appears to be a middle - aged ( age 2 - 10 gyr ) slowly rotating inactive star , on the main sequence .",
    "this is consistent with the age derived from the asteroseismology analysis ( section  [ sec : astero ] ) .",
    "the activity indices , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , have modestly lower than solar values , while figure  [ fig : q4phot ] suggests significantly lower than typical levels of photometric variability compared to the sun .",
    "@xcite summarize 14 years of contemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic ( for activity ) measurements of 28 solar analog stars with precisions in the photometry capable of detecting changes at roughly half the level seen for the sun .",
    "although a strong correlation between photometric variability exists with activity , they find that stars with near - solar activity indices show a range of half ( not well bounded ) to twice solar in photometric variability .",
    "kepler-68  seems consistent with this lower range of photometric change at a given activity level , although not knowing what phase of a kepler-68  activity cycle was sampled limits fidelity .",
    "multi - year _ kepler _  data will eventually enable robust activity  photometric variability understanding .",
    "the utility of asteroseismology for exoplanet interpretations fundamentally rests on recognizing that both asteroseismic and transit light curve modeling ( at high signal to noise levels and with known or assumed eccentricity ) provide constraints on the same stellar parameter  @xmath83 .",
    "thus high precision knowledge of @xmath83  which commonly results when asteroseismology is feasible provides for a natural means of tightening the exoplanet transit light curve solution by adopting this as a prior  see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "kepler-68  at @xmath39 = 10.00 , near solar temperature , and a kic radius of 1.06 @xmath84 was recognized early as an excellent candidate for asteroseismology with a prediction of 99% chance of success with only two months of short cadence data @xcite .",
    "kepler-68  was observed at short cadence ( sc ) @xcite for one month in q2 as a kasc survey target , then added to the science team sc targets from q5 onwards to support asteroseismology and fine analyses of the short transit ingress and egress .",
    "the power of asteroseismology in setting estimates of the stellar radius , which determines the exoplanet radius via ratio with the transit depth depending on the square of this ratio , can be seen by recounting knowledge of @xmath85 for kepler-68  at the time of initial analyses .",
    "transit light curve solutions for kepler-68b , with stellar radius as a free parameter returned values of 1.63 @xmath84 , compared to a kic radius of 1.06 @xmath84 ( with spectroscopic solutions favoring something like the kic value ) .",
    "these two stellar radius values would lead to differences of a factor of 3.6 in the planetary density emphasizing the need for better knowledge of the stellar radius .",
    "figure [ fig : power ] shows the kepler-68  power spectral density with input of 10 months of sc data , the near - evenly spaced peaks characteristic of solar - like oscillations are obvious .",
    "even when first inspecting power spectra from single months of sc data the spacing between modes was trivial to estimate at about 100 @xmath86hz compared to a solar value of 135 @xmath86hz . since the mean stellar density is known to scale as the square of frequency spacing @xcite , this allowed an early constraint that kepler-68  was at 0.55 of the solar mean density , and assuming a solar mass ( given the solar @xmath80 ) provided an estimate of 1.22 @xmath84 at the back - of - the - envelope level of analysis .",
    "the high snr of the power spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : power ] made peak - bagging ( derivation of frequencies for individual modes ) straightforward , and eight team members fit the modes using maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) , and mcmc approaches ( e.g. , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we use a correction to the frequencies for these near - surface errors , of the form @xmath129 @xcite , where @xmath130 is obtained from a corresponding solar fit , @xmath131 was fixed in the middle of the observed frequency range and @xmath132 was obtained from a fit of a suitable reference model to the observed frequencies .    with these procedures ,",

    "the resulting density , mass and radius provided by grid - based solutions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) were consistent with our more detailed fit presented here .",
    "likewise , fits using the asteroseismic modeling portal ( see @xcite for details ) gives values very close to those presented here .",
    "our primary asteroseismic solutions used the formal spectroscopic errors of 44 k on @xmath80  and allowed a spread of @xmath23 0.08 dex on [ fe / h ] .",
    "we have used grid - based solutions starting with these errors , and the more appropriate errors of 74 k on @xmath80  and 0.074 dex on [ fe / h]to show that changes in the directly constrained stellar density are negligible , and that inferred values of stellar mass and radius change by 0.2 and 0.3 @xmath38 respectively in comparison to the errors already quoted in table 4 .",
    "the associated errors on stellar properties also changed little in comparison to values already in use .",
    "the asteroseismic solutions given here are based on only about half of the now available short cadence data .",
    "however , the quality of the frequency extractions for kepler-68with the data through q7 only is already sufficiently good that residual errors from the asteroseismic solution are negligible for the inference of exoplanet parameters .",
    "indeed the asteroseismology for kepler-68  will be among the very best possible with _ kepler _ , and further results concentrating on fine details of this star will appear in the future .",
    "as an example , some of the best fitting stellar evolution models indicated a small convective core , hence it would be good to explore inclusion of convective core overshoot .",
    "initial exploration of core overshoot indicated that this had negligible impact on the mean stellar density required for exoplanet inferences and was not further pursued .",
    "the quality of kepler-68  data for asteroseismology will likely support inferences on the outer convection zone depth @xcite and obliquity of the rotation axis @xcite in future analyses .",
    "kepler-68  is a near twin of @xmath19 cen a with inferred values of @xmath80 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and age all within 1-@xmath38 of each other , despite the small error bars for both  see @xcite and references therein",

    "both stars have now been interpreted with the benefit of asteroseismology .",
    "the quality of asteroseismic constraints are superior for kepler-68 , with general astronomical knowledge being better for the nearby binary @xmath19 cen a. differential analyses of these two interesting stars may prove fruitful .",
    "the physical and orbital properties of both transit signatures are derived by simultaneously fitting _ kepler _",
    "photometry and keck radial velocities and by adopting the mean stellar density , @xmath136 , and @xmath137of the host star as determined by asteroseismology",
    ".    the _ kepler _  photometry and keck radial velocities are fit with non - interacting keplerian orbits .",
    "the model parameters are the mean stellar density ( @xmath83 ) and a flux and radial velocity zero point and for each planet , the time of transit ( @xmath139 ) , orbital period ( @xmath140 ) , impact parameter ( @xmath141 ) , scaled planetary radius ( @xmath142 ) , radial velocity amplitude ( @xmath50 ) and eccentricity and argument of pericenter   parametrized   as @xmath143  and @xmath144 .",
    "the transit was modeled   using the analytic formalization of mandel & agol  ( 2002 ) to fit photometric observations of the transit .",
    "we   use the quadratic parameterization of limb darkening   also described by mandel & agol ( 2002 ) with   coefficients ( 0.4096 , 0.2602 ) calculated by claret & bloemen ( 2011 ) for the _ kepler _  bandpass .",
    "model fits to the kepler-68b  light  curve yield an eccentricity that is consistent with zero   ( @xmath143  = 0.02 @xmath23 0.10 ; @xmath144  = 20.13 @xmath23 0.20 ) which is  consistent with our expectations for tidal circularization   ( mazeh 2008 ) .",
    "given the large orbital separation of the   outer planet candidate , we can not assume its orbit to   be circular based on tidal circularization .",
    "the duration   of the transit for the outer planet candidate is consistent   with a circular orbit , but the resulting upper limit is still   significant ( @xmath145 @xmath146  0.2 ) . for the remainder of our discussion , the models are constrained to zero eccentricity for   both kepler-68b  and kepler-68c .",
    "the radial velocity variations   are modeled by assuming non - interacting ( keplerian )   orbits . with kepler-68c",
    "validated , the   relative inclination between the two orbits is likely less   than 20 degrees , as larger relative inclinations would require a   fortuitous alignment of the orbital nodes for both planets   to transit ( ragozzine & holman 2010 ) .",
    "we initially fit our observations by fixing @xmath147 to its asteroseismic values ( see section 6.2 ) .",
    "model   parameters are found by chi - squared minimization using   a levenberg - marquardt prescription .",
    "we then use   the best - fit values to seed a markov chain monte carlo   ( mcmc ) parameter search ( ford 2005 ) to fit all model   parameters with @xmath83from the asteroseismic solution .",
    "we adopt the asteroseismic determined   mean - stellar density as a prior of the overall solution .      for a nominal two - planet model ( i.e. , circular orbits with masses from table 4 ) ,",
    "the predicted root mean square ( rms ) transit timing variations ( ttvs ) for kepler-68b  & kepler-68c  are both less than half a minute .",
    "the median timing uncertainties ( based on long - cadence observations ) are  3.3 and  20 minutes .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that _ kepler _  has not provided a ttv signal due to the interaction of kepler-68b  and kepler-68c  from initial searches . even with a possible factor of two precision gain from short - cadence data , and an available long time - series providing square root of the number of transits gain , predictions are that detection of a ttv signal on kepler-68b  remains marginal , and unlikely for kepler-68c . even increasing the masses of both planets by three times the upper `` one - sigma '' uncertainty above the estimates in table 4 , the predicted rms ttvs are less than a minute for both planets .",
    "similarly , even models with unrealistically large eccentricities ( @xmath145 = 0.3 and the nominal masses ) can result in rms ttvs of less than a minute .",
    "therefore , we have not performed a detailed ttv analysis of this system .",
    "the synthesis of radial velocity monitoring , transit photometry , and precise asteroseismic stellar characterization reveals that kepler-68b s mass , radius , and density are all intermediate between the properties of earth and the solar system ice giants .",
    "s bulk density ( @xmath148 ) is low enough to imply that volatiles ( in the form of h / he or astrophysical ices ) make a significant contribution to the total planet mass and volume .",
    "kepler-68b  can not be composed of iron and silicates alone ; an iron - poor silicate composition is too dense by more than @xmath149 .",
    "even a carbon - rich mineralogy  which may lead to solid planets with larger radii than the earth - like mineralogy often assumed @xcite  does not account for the planet density within @xmath59 . following @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we constrain the range of bulk compositions that are consistent with kepler-68b s measured mass and radius . assuming an earth - like rocky interior composition ( consisting of 32% fe and 68% silicate by mass ) kepler-68b  would need between 0.07% and 0.6% of its mass in a h / he gas layer , or alternatively between 21% and 76% of its mass in a water vapor envelope .",
    "intermediate compositions with a mixture of h / he and higher mean molecular weight material from ices are also possible .    compared to kepler-68b ,",
    "the compositions of the other planets orbiting kepler-68  are less well constrained because the bulk planet densities are unknown .",
    "given its jupiter - like minimum mass , the outermost planet ( kepler-68d ) is likely to be dominated by h / he . without a transit measurement of kepler-68d s radius , however , neither the dominant composition nor the more subtle proportion of heavy elements in the planet interior can be directly inferred . at the other extreme of the planetary mass scale ,",
    "earth - sized kepler-68c  has only a marginal radial velocity detection .",
    "planet interior structure models place more stringent constraints on the planet mass than the @xmath150 radial velocity upper limit of @xmath151 .",
    "if kepler-68c  is a rocky body composed of iron and silicate , its mass would fall within @xmath152  even a pure iron configuration is allowed .",
    "a residual radial velocity precision better than @xmath153 is needed to constrain kepler-68c s make - up .",
    "a striking feature of the kepler-68  planetary system is that it harbors one of the most strongly irradiated volatile - rich mini - neptunes detected to date .",
    "the stellar energy flux received by kepler-68b  is more than @xmath154 times larger than that received by the earth . among low - mass ( @xmath155 ) planets with measured radii , only kepler-10b , 55  cnc  e , corot-7b , and kepler-18b",
    "are more strongly irradiated by their host stars .",
    "these planets have higher densities than kepler-68b , however , and are consistent with volatile - less compositions within the @xmath59 uncertainties on their measured masses and radii .",
    "kepler-10b , corot-7b , and kepler-18b may be comprised solely of iron and silicates ( with no h / he or astrophysical ices ) , and 55  cnc  e ( although not dense enough to have a silicate composition ) could have a carbon - rich solid composition without a volatile envelope @xcite .",
    "kepler-68b s status as the most strongly irradiated mini - neptune that unambiguously ( when the @xmath59 uncertainties are taken into account ) has a significant amount of volatiles makes it a valuable benchmark for planet mass - loss models .",
    "like many of the highly irradiated _ kepler _  planets , mass loss has likely had an important influence sculpting kepler-68b s composition over its 6.3 gyr lifetime .",
    "indeed , kepler-68b  lies near the edge of the empirical mass loss destruction threshold noted by several authors @xcite . at 8.3 @xmath156 ,",
    "kepler-68b  is close to the minimum mass of 6.5 @xmath156 predicted by mass loss in @xcite . in order to examine the vulnerability of kepler-68b  in greater detail we employed the coupled thermal and mass loss evolution models of @xcite , assuming an earth - like core and 10% mass loss efficiency .",
    "although , kepler-68b  is stable against mass loss today , it is possible that it underwent substantial mass loss early in its history when radii were larger and stellar xuv fluxes were over 100@xmath32 higher @xcite .",
    "in fact , if kepler-68b  had a h / he envelope then , it was vulnerable to a type of runaway mass loss that occurs when the mass loss timescale becomes short compared to the cooling timescale @xcite .",
    "although less than 1% h / he today , kepler-68b  would need to have been @xmath1780% h / he when it was 10 myr old in order to have a residual primordial h / he envelope today .",
    "moreover , models that undergo this type of extreme mass loss almost always lead to a planet completely stripped of its h / he envelope @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions must be carefully fine tuned in order to arrive at a planet that has such a small but non - zero h / he envelope today .",
    "this suggests that it is unlikely that kepler-68b  retains a primordial h / he envelope .",
    "on the other hand , a steam envelope on kepler-68b  should be very stable against mass loss .",
    "if kepler-68b  is @xmath1750% water today , then it has only lost @xmath171% of its initial water envelope since it was 10 myr old .",
    "this suggests that it is possible that like kepler-68d , 68b formed beyond the snow - line and migrated to its current orbit .",
    "however , another distinct possibility is that kepler-68b  does in fact have a h / he envelope , just not a primordial one .",
    "@xcite showed that rocky planets could outgas up to 0.9% of their mass in h / he , more than sufficient to explain the envelope needed today .    on the whole ,",
    "the kepler-68  planetary system shares characteristics both with the compact kepler multi - planet systems ( e.g. , kepler-11 and kepler-20 ) and with the solar system .",
    "like kepler-11 and kepler-20 , kepler-68  has multiple transiting planets within 0.1  au . in common with the solar system ,",
    "kepler-68  has a jovian - mass planet residing outside ( at greater orbital separations than ) the smaller bodies in the inner system . between 0.1 and 1.4 au ,",
    "there are no confirmed planets in the kepler-68  system , although our census may be incomplete .",
    "the presence of a volatile - rich super earth within 0.06  au combined with the presence of a luke - warm jupiter inside the snow line makes the kepler-68  system an interesting case study for planet formation and migration theories .",
    "two distinct sets of transit events were detected in the lightcurve of kepler-68  constructed from @xmath157 years of _ kepler _  photometry .",
    "physical models , constrained by the asteroseismology - derived stellar parameters , were simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision doppler measurements .",
    "modeling produced tight constraints on the properties of kepler-68b : @xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath158=@xmath159@xmath160 g @xmath5 .",
    "evaluation of these properties within a theoretical framework allowed us to draw conclusions about the planet s composition , arguing that a simple iron and silicate structure is excluded .",
    "kepler-68b  must retain significant volatiles , even though highly irradiated .",
    "the outer planet , kepler-68d , is detected only in radial velocities for which an upper limit to the mass is approximately jupiter in scale , and in a mars - like orbit .",
    "transits of kepler-68d  would not be expected , if at the same inclination inferred from the impact parameters for kepler-68b , and kepler-68c . at the two epochs of _ kepler _   data in which transits of kepler-68d  would be seen",
    "if they existed , none are present .",
    "there is still a 1% chance that if kepler-68d  does transit , the transits could have been missed in minor data gaps .",
    "the presence of an outer giant planet further enriches the interpretive potential for the kepler-68  system .",
    "kepler-68c , the intermediate planet , produces transits of only 55 ppm depth ( less than 2/3 that of an earth analog ) .",
    "but due to the brightness of kepler-68 , coupled with low stellar activity and the modest orbital period of 9.6 days , it is detected at high confidence from the _ kepler _  photometry .",
    "radial velocities do not provide confirmation , although the formally inferred amplitude at a phase fixed from the transits appears at the 1-@xmath38 level .",
    "the upper limit on mass from the rvs is not significant for inferring interesting aspects about the planet composition .",
    "blender  provided a sufficiently high odds ratio to assert tha kepler-68c  is a planet .",
    "this validation came with an added complication in this case , however , in that some individual false positive scenarios ( the best being for a 7 magnitude fainter background eclipsing binary ) provided formally better fits to the phased light curve than did a simple planet transit model . with an odds ratio over 10,000 for the planet interpretation , it is proper to accept this , with perhaps some qualification reserved in this case .",
    "were further data to more definitively provide evidence that a subtle feature at phase 0.5 in the light curve is properly interpreted as a secondary eclipse , then the statistical argument for  validation \" would be over - ruled by  confirmation \" as a false positive .",
    "this qualifies as an interesting system even in the context of so many exciting and unique discoveries coming from the _ kepler mission _  with a bright , quiet star providing exquisite asteroseismic constraints on stellar properties ; radial velocities providing a precise mass for one transiting planet and supporting discovery of an outer planet ; and the second transiting planet validated . that the innermost transiting planet has been shown to have a density intermediate between terrestrial and gas giant planets , with sufficient fidelity to inform theoretical models of its structure ,",
    "further bolsters the assertion that the kepler-68  exoplanet system is an important development in this rapidly expanding field .",
