    "the internet has revolutionized science and society in many ways .",
    "studies of human communication networks nowadays deal with data sets of thousands people or more . gone are the days when one had to rely solely on interview surveys and observational studies . these new and larger data sets open up new possibilities",
    " one does not only get higher precision in the measurement of network structure , one can also rid the structural quantities of finite size effects that would hinder the prediction of phenomena such as large - scale information spreading .",
    "the accessibility of large data sets has also drawn the interest of statistical physicists , habitually working in the large - scale limit , to this traditionally sociological field .",
    "the sociologists themselves , naturally , contribute to the development , and make the study of communication networks a thriving interdisciplinary arena .",
    "internet has , of course , changed other aspects of society than science . in the perennial human quest to find a partner , romantic or",
    "otherwise , the internet provides a new _ modus operandi_. in this paper we study a swedish internet community , pussokram.com , intended for romantic communication among adolescents .",
    "the methods we propose do not only work for dating communities , but for internet communities in general .",
    "our definition of an internet community is a set of html - pages facilitating some type of directed messages ( i.e.  not all messages are broadcasted to the whole community ) , and where each member is associated with a home page .",
    "this definition includes social networking sites @xcite but excludes , for example , news groups @xcite .",
    "the data we use , the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , are anonymized lists of contacts ",
    "triples @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the id - number of the sender , @xmath2 is the id - number of the receiver , and @xmath3 is the time ( in seconds ) since an arbitrary start time .",
    "the ids are integer numbers with no relation to the users of the real community .",
    "we do not have access to the messages themselves , nor the individual presentations on the user homepages ( or any other text or images either ) .",
    "researched data sets of electronic communication have often been constructed from email exchange  , and to a lesser extent from communication within internet communities  @xcite .",
    "the advantage with internet communities is that they are a closed system  all communication can be recorded . the network of emails is a much larger and more important phenomenon . but studies of email networks are plagued by statistical biases due to the openness of the system . for email communication one typically samples a set of individuals and either restricts the data to messages sent within the group ( which leaves the message set incomplete )  @xcite or one includes contacts to outer vertices , which does not include contact between outer vertices .",
    "for this reason the study of internet communities may not only be of interest _ per se _ , but is also illuminating towards the general structure of electronic communication .    the goal of this paper is to say something about what makes a user successful in the community . given our very restricted data ",
    "needless to say , the most relevant information is in the text and imagery we do not have  is there anything that can be said ?",
    "we propose simple measures for attractiveness and activity and observe that they are positively correlated in the contact sequences .",
    "more than that , these two quantities are more strongly correlated for the real - world data than for the null model we propose .",
    "it thus pays off , directly or ( more likely ) indirectly , to be an active community member .",
    ".[tab : sizes ] the sizes of our three data sets : the number of vertices @xmath4 , edges @xmath5 and contacts @xmath6 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the previous section we defined three vertex - specific measures for internet community contact sequences .",
    "we measured the probability distribution and the correlations between the measures .",
    "the design of the measures does not exclude that correlations may be induced by the growth of the community . to frame the correlations associated with the psychology of the community members",
    ", we need something to compare the values with , i.e.  a null model .",
    "in fact , we propose two null models , one more and one less restricted . we follow the general approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and sample randomizations of the real - world data set rather than constructing parametric null models . in both these models",
    "we will keep the sizes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the same as in the original contact sequences . not only that",
    ", we assume the growth of @xmath4 is unrelated to the psychology of the community members , we also keep the time evolution of @xmath4 the same as in the real data . furthermore ,",
    "as the community grows with time the communication rate in the data should also be growing . with a parametric null model",
    "this would be hard to implement , but we just keep the set of times from the real data and the communication rate exactly the same as in the real - world contact sequence .    in the first , less constrained , model we apply the restrictions above .",
    "a randomized contact sequence is constructed as follows :    1 .",
    "[ enu:1c ] for each vertex @xmath1 add one contact to or from ( with equal probability ) at time @xmath7 .",
    "the other vertex of the contact is chosen with uniform randomness among the vertices present in the data at this time .",
    "[ enu : rest ] draw @xmath8 times randomly from the set of non - first contacts .",
    "( i.e.  contacts @xmath0 , such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 . )",
    "add contacts between vertices present in the community at these times .",
    "step [ enu:1c ] ensures that the number of active members is the same in the randomized sequence as in the real - world data .",
    "step [ enu : rest ] makes the set of times almost equal to the empirical set of times .",
    "note that , contacts between two vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath11 will give rise to two contacts in the randomized sequence ; so the set of non - first contacts used in step [ enu : rest ] will be slightly ( @xmath12 ) larger than @xmath8 .    as mentioned in the previous section",
    "a broad activity distribution has been observed in many data sets similar to ours .",
    "one may argue that activity is a rather independent trait , little connected to the contact dynamics . whether or not this is true",
    ", we construct a null model to test how the reality differs from such a scenario . to generate a random sequence realization for this model we loop over all contacts @xmath0 and replace @xmath2 ( the vertex the message is sent to ) by a random vertex @xmath13 present in the community at time @xmath3 .",
    "clearly this procedure conserves @xmath6 .",
    "it may result in a few isolated vertices ( vertices of zero out - degree who looses their incoming links ) , and a slightly altered time evolution of @xmath4 ( vertices whose first contact is incoming may appear later in the randomized community than in the real - world data ) . for our data these effects are small , and we assume them to be negligible .",
    "values of the linear ( pearson s ) correlation coefficient between attractiveness , activity and participance rates for the real and null model networks can be found in table  [ tab : corr ] .",
    "first we note that the attractiveness and activity are more strongly correlated in the real community than in both models , and that this holds for all three networks .",
    "this means that the correlation between attractiveness and activity is not an artifact of the growth of the community ( by comparison with model 1 ) , neither is it a result of a skewed distribution of a ( hypothetical ) intrinsic activity ( by comparison with model 2 ) . unlike the attractiveness vs.  activity correlation",
    ", the correlation between activity and participance rate seems to a large extent to be an effect of the growth of the network .",
    "we see that model 2 induces a very high correlation between activity and participance rate .",
    "model 2 randomizes the recipients but keeps the rest of the communication the same as in the original data .",
    "the fact that the users engage in dialogs is an explanation for the lower correlation in the real world data  two users sending contacts to only each other , but frequently is active but have low participance ratio .",
    "the correlation between the participance rate and attractiveness of the real data is even more different from the null model than the attractiveness - activity correlation .",
    "this means that the vertices of highest degree in the social network generated by the communication are also the one that most frequently get incoming new contacts .",
    "another interesting observation is that the messages data have higher attractiveness correlations than the guest book and all contacts data .",
    "since the messages are not publicly visible one can assume that the real romantic communication takes place here rather than in the guest book writing .",
    "this strengthen the conclusion that active users are attractive in internet dating .",
    "we note that ( spearman type ) rank correlations are typically a little stronger than the linear correlations , but since they add little new information to the discussion we do not include them in our tables .",
    "in this paper we have introduced three measures to characterize users in online communities : attractiveness , activity and participance rate ( measuring how fast a user get to know others in the community ) .",
    "while these three measures are sensible in general internet communities , we evaluate them for an internet dating community  @xcite . how and why people end up as partners is well studied in an off - line setting  @xcite ; attractiveness in terms of body shape  @xcite , facial characteristics  @xcite and body odor  @xcite are all well - known . with internet communities playing an increasingly important role on the dating scene",
    "@xcite one need to complement the studies of in - real - life attractiveness with investigations of online romantic preferences . in this paper",
    "we find that the attractiveness ( the number of incoming new contacts per time ) is positively correlated with activity ( the number of contacts taken per time ) , and that this correlation is significantly stronger than for our two null models .",
    "we find this heightened correlation in the real - world data even stronger in the dataset of e - mail - like messages than in the other data sets ( including messages visible to the whole community ) .",
    "since the activity , as we measure it , is rather invisible to other members , this correlation has to be a secondary effect .",
    "( writing in guest books increases ones visibility and is a , presumably small , direct effect . )",
    "it is natural to assume that the users that send many messages , and thus invest much time into their community , also spend comparatively more time embellishing their homepages .",
    "the conclusion is thus that it pays off to spend effort on one s personal presentation .",
    "another factor is that highly active users are most likely logged in more often than low - activity users .",
    "since currently logged in users are displayed , the increased visibility of frequently logged in members may boost the attractiveness of active users .",
    "we also find highly skewed , power - law - like distributions of attractiveness , activity and participance rate .",
    "the mechanisms behind electronic communication and offline behavior are presumably very different . nevertheless , similar quantities in off - line relationships , such as the number of partners per time , are also known have this feature  @xcite .",
    "research on the structure and dynamics of internet communities is still a young field .",
    "their statistical advantages ( being closed systems ) compared to e - mail exchange make us anticipate much future work with both data analysis and modeling approaches .",
