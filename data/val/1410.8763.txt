    "grown structures of nanometre - scale organic molecules are the corner stone of organic semiconductor device constructions .",
    "the desired morphologies of organic molecules in semiconductor devices range from ultra - thin crystalline films @xcite to islands , nanowires @xcite and crystallites @xcite .",
    "devices that require such morphologies include solar cells @xcite , and transistors @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is now well established that the morphology , combined with the type and structure of the substrate @xcite , determines the device functionality .",
    "their influence determines features such as the electron transport , the charge carrier mobility @xcite , and the band gap energies @xcite of semiconductor devices .",
    "these features are , in turn , strongly influenced by morphological imperfections , which easily arise during the ( non - equilibrium ) growth process of organic structures on the substrate .",
    "it is therefore crucial to understand on a _ microscopic _ ( molecular ) level the entire process of formation of such organic - molecule structures from growth towards the final equilibrium state .",
    "+ from the experimental side , information on the morphology of the organic component is obtained e.g. , via atomic force- @xcite and scanning electron microscopy @xcite , raman scattering @xcite , x - ray scattering @xcite and electron microscopy @xcite . in particular , real - time x - ray scattering can be used to monitor the film formation _ in situ _ and thus gives important information about the system s behavior on its way _ towards _ thermal equilibrium . from the theoretical side ,",
    "the techniques employed to investigate equilibrium ( or even ground state ) structures of organic molecules range from ab - initio density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite over atomically resolved molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite to coarse - grained monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "growth processes are typically studied via kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations @xcite and rate equations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ the above examples illustrate that the structure formation of organic molecules is a very active field of research .",
    "however , contrary to the situation for atomic systems @xcite , a comprehensive understanding of corresponding organic - molecule systems is still missing . from the theoretical perspective , one major challenge is the molecule s anisotropy which strongly increases the configurational space in equilibrium sampling , as well as the space of possible movements during surface growth .",
    "another challenge , particularly for md and mc simulations relying on classical force fields , arises due to the typically complicated charge distributions and polarizability effects characterizing many organic molecules .",
    "+ in the present paper we investigate , based on particle - resolved kmc simulations , the growth of molecular films composed of c@xmath0 ( fullerene ) . in particular , we aim to explore the _ single - particle dynamic properties _ that accompany multilayer growth .",
    "these include free particle diffusion , caging , and detaching from neighbors .",
    "first steps towards unravelling c@xmath0 multilayer growth have been taken in ref .",
    "@xcite where we developed , together with experiments , a kmc model capable of describing various real - space data .",
    "+ application - wise , c@xmath0 is a key component to semiconductor devices such as transistors @xcite and solar cells @xcite because of its high electron yield and photophysical properties @xcite . from a more conceptual perspective",
    ", c@xmath0 is clearly one of the easiest representatives within the material class of organic molecules due to its nearly spherical shape .",
    "indeed , at the temperatures considered in our study c@xmath0 is known to rotate freely not only in the fluid phase , but also in the bulk crystal @xcite and in one - dimensional confinement @xcite .",
    "thus , one may expect nearly - free rotations also in film - like geometries .",
    "moreover , since a c@xmath0 molecule involves only carbon atoms , partial charge effects are not important .",
    "all these features suggest viewing c@xmath0 as a particularly large _ atom _ ( with a diameter of about one nanometre ) rather than as a large organic molecule .",
    "+ however , besides size and internal structure there is another important difference between c@xmath0 molecules and atoms : the range of the _ effective _ , i.e. angle - averaged , attractive interaction between two c@xmath0 molecules is much smaller than the usual van - der waals interaction ( decaying as @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the separation ) between atoms @xcite .",
    "this difference between the pair potentials is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_sketch ] .",
    "the short range of attraction between c@xmath0 molecules has important consequences for the overall equilibrium phase behavior ; in particular , c@xmath0 lacks a liquid phase @xcite but tends to form a gel phase @xcite . in that sense",
    ", c@xmath0 rather behaves like a system of colloids , where short - range attraction ( stemming from depletion effects ) is in fact quite common .",
    "+ here we are interested in c@xmath0 growth .",
    "earlier theoretical studies in this area have focused on aspects such as determination of step - edge barriers and potential landscapes ( yielding diffusion rates ) from dft , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "studies addressing the surface morphology have often been restricted to a coverage of less than one monolayer @xcite .",
    "note that this contrasts with the situation for atomic systems where growth phenomena for both , monolayers and multilayers have been studied intensely for a wide range of systems @xcite .",
    "these studies include even subtle phenomena such as concerted gliding of islands @xcite or direction - resolved step - edge diffusion @xcite . + in our recent study we have obtained , together with real - time experiments @xcite , a consistent set of energy - barrier parameters for kmc simulations which describe measurable morphological quantities such as island density and layer coverage as functions of time .",
    "interestingly , these energy parameters reflect again the intermediate role of c@xmath0 between atoms and colloids : while the step - edge diffusion barrier is close to what one expects for atoms , the binding energy stemming from attractive interactions is much smaller , reflecting indirectly the much shorter range of attraction . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on the similarities and differences between the growth of the spherical molecule c@xmath0 and comparable atomic systems . using these two system types , we study the interplay between morphology and the single - particle dynamics during growth .",
    "we find significant differences between the two system types .",
    "these differences concern the evolution of their surface morphologies , the long - time scaling behavior of the morphology , and the particle - resolved dynamics .",
    "the differences are traced back to the different time scales competing in the surface evolution , by correlating local surface structures with single - particle dynamics .",

    "this allows us to access large surfaces ( with @xmath3 lattice sites ) with molecular resolution .",
    "the free diffusion time , that is the average time span a particle takes for one diffusion step if it is not interacting with lateral neighbors , is @xmath4 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in total , however , the simulations cover the experimentally relevant range of minutes to hours .",
    "+ during the growth process particles adsorb on the surface with a constant effective adsorption rate @xmath5 and diffuse on the surface , until they become immobilized due to interaction effects .",
    "finally they are buried under the next grown layer .",
    "the diffusion process of a particle from site @xmath6 to site @xmath7 is given through the rate determined in the clarke - vvedensky bond - counting ansatz @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath11 is the planck constant .",

    "( [ eqn::rate ] ) , the diffusion rate @xmath13 depends exponentially on the total energy barrier the particle has to overcome to reach site @xmath7 .",
    "this energy barrier consists of a contribution for free diffusion , @xmath14 , a contribution arising from the interaction with the @xmath15 nearest neighbor particles , @xmath16 , and an ehrlich - schwoebel energy barrier , @xmath17 .",
    "the latter is relevant for trajectories that lead across step edges , i.e. , @xmath18 when crossing step edges , otherwise @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the restriction of the interaction term to the nearest neighbors alone is consistent with the fact that the distance - dependent attraction between c@xmath0 molecules is relatively short - ranged compared to the molecular diameter @xcite .",

    "+ in accordance with experiments @xcite , we simulate the growth process on a triangular lattice which is equivalent to the fcc(111 ) lattice face of a bulk c@xmath0 crystal .",
    "interstitial sites are not considered .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the growth process is free of defects in the sense that particles can only sit on lattice sites and can not form overhangs .",
    "if particles reach sites that are not supported by three `` base particles '' in the underlying layer , they relax to surrounding lattice sites with probabilities proportional to the corresponding diffusion rates @xmath13 .",
    "+ we also note that our simulation does not take into account coordinated , simultaneous motion of particle clusters .",
    "previous studies @xcite have indicated that concerted cluster diffusion influences the growth only during the very initial phase of island nucleation , when the particle clusters are small .",
    "furthermore , in a self - learning kmc study of the system cu / cu(111 ) , karim _ et al . _ @xcite found that the diffusion barriers of clusters scales nearly linearly with the cluster size : specifically , they find an effective diffusion barrier for dimer diffusion , which is approximately twice as high as that corresponding to monomers .",
    "transferring this trend to our c@xmath0 system , in which the monomer barrier @xmath14 is already quite large , we expect a very large energy barrier for dimer diffusion .",
    "thus , we expect cluster diffusion to take place only on very long time scales and , therefore , we expect very little influence of concerted cluster diffusion on the dynamic properties studied here .",
    "the simulation parameters are chosen in accordance with recent experiments @xcite , in which _ in situ _ measurements were made during growth .",
    "these experiments use x - ray scattering to gain insight into the real - time evolution of both the island density and layer coverage , simultaneously .",
    "the layer coverage is monitored through the modulation of the scattering intensity at the so - called `` anti - bragg point '' , while the island density is deduced from small - angle x - ray scattering @xcite . by comparing these experimentally obtained quantities with corresponding kmc results for a range of temperatures and adsorption rates , we were able to find a consistent set of energy barriers .",

    "+ a quite different behavior is seen for atomic particles that arrive on the islands [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:2msd](b ) ] .",
    "these particles can diffuse across fairly large dendritic structures before encountering other particles .",
    "the step edges hinder particles from leaving the island , but they do not noticably slow down their motion on the islands .",
    "therefore , atomic particles on the islands can travel significantly further ( as compared to the case discussed before ) before they become immobilized and the msd saturates .",
    "+ the c@xmath0 system is characterized by a completely different island morphology [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1trajectories](a ) ] . as a consequence , molecules that arrive between islands can diffuse far further before encountering other molecules , just because there is more free space .",
    "moreover , c@xmath0 molecules can _ detach _ after encountering other molecules ( as a result of the weaker binding ) .",
    "these effects lead to much larger traveled distances both between and on islands .",
    "furthermore , the msd curves for these two cases are similar .",
    "+ an even better understanding of the systems emerges when we relate the msds to the occurrence of certain individual processes .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig:3processe ] , where we focus on particles arriving in between islands .",
    "parts ( a ) and ( c ) show the corresponding msds , while parts ( b ) and ( d ) contain data for the fraction of particles involved in a specific process , @xmath104 for both , c@xmath0 and ag systems it is clearly visible that the early stages of growth are dominated by freely diffusing particles ( @xmath1050 ) .",
    "these form the main contribution to the msd at small times . however , once particles begin to interact , distinct differences between c@xmath0 and ag become apparent . during the growth of c@xmath0",
    "there are many events where particles detach from one or two neighboring particles ( see curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:3processe](b ) with @xmath106 ) .",
    "such events are absent in the ag system .",
    "we understand this difference as a consequence of the larger binding energy in the ag system .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the single - particle and global dynamics accompanying the surface growth of the nanomolecular system c@xmath0 . one main goal in this context was to understand the similarities and differences between nanomolecular and atomic growth for the spherical molecule c@xmath0 .",
    "to this end , we have first identified energetic differences between the two system types .",
    "we then used the two system types to study both single - particle trajectories and the overall surface morphology .",
    "+ we have found that there are indeed pronounced differences in the surface morphology during growth : the c@xmath0 system displays compact islands with a rather large fractal dimension and significant spatial correlations between the islands .",
    "in contrast , the fractal dimension and range of ordering are far smaller in atomic systems .",
    "these differences in the global surface morphology during growth can be traced back to the differences in the energy barriers that single particles have to overcome .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the differences in morphology is intimately related to the single - particle dynamics .",
    "atomic particles diffusing between islands can cover only small distances before they are immobilized , because the islands are fairly dendritic .",
    "on the other hand , particles in the c@xmath0 system can diffuse quite far , since the compact islands are separated through large , free surfaces .",
    "+ the large diffusion distances are effectively enhanced by the fact that due to the small binding energies , c@xmath0 molecules can detach from island edges before they are immobilized . however , unlike colloidal systems @xcite , c@xmath0 has to overcome an energetic atom - like step - edge barrier for interlayer diffusion .",
    "this leads to a reduced mobility of both , molecules and atoms , between layers .",
    "the reduced mobility then leads to a roughening of the surface on large time - scales .",
    "+ in summary we find a complex interplay of single - particle and global dynamics , whose characteristics reflect special molecular features of c@xmath0 , in particular the relatively small effective binding energy . starting from our findings , one interesting question for further studies",
    "would be the connection between single - particle - trajectories and the long - time scaling behavior derived from continuous rate - model descriptions .",
    "+ further , for a more detailed insight concerning the interplay of energy landscape and dynamics , it may be interesting to couple kmc simulations and md simulations .",
    "withing such a study , configurations gained from kmc could be used to generate inital configurations for md simulations .",
    "conversely , md simulations could be used calculate `` on the fly '' the energy parameters required in the kmc simulations , thus taking into account the time - dependence of the energetics .",
    "such an approach would yield important insight into all time - scales from up to @xmath107s towards @xmath108s .",
    "+ experimentall , real - time measurements of the overall surface morphology during the growth of organic molecules are possible through x - ray scattering @xcite or low energy electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of individual molecules is experimentally not ( yet ) accessible , as these phenomena take place on very small time - scales .",
    "very recently , measurements of the particle - resolved dynamics of colloidal particles at room temperature have been performed @xcite . however , in molecular systems , particle resolved dynamics under consideration of the local particle neighborhood is only accessible at very low temperatures .",
    "an example are scanning tunneling microscopy experiments to track the motion of individual molecules on a substrate and to determine waiting times @xcite . extending such investigations to higher temperatures",
    "may open the path to quantities such as the ones calculated in the present work .",

    "the energy parameters listed in table  [ tab:1values ] , which we obtained by comparing with corresponding experiments @xcite , are of the same order of magnitude as other values @xcite reported in the literature , but differ in their actual magnitude . in the following we briefly discuss to which end",
    "these differences can be attributed to differences of energy barrier definitions and of simulation approaches .",

    "moreover , both studies are based on a hexagonal lattice under consideration of interstitial sites .",
    "here , we neglect these sites , yielding a somewhat coarse - grained approach .",
    "we note that without the coarse - grained approach it would not be possible to simulate such a large system for minutes to hours of experimental time . in one diffusion step on our coarse - grained lattice a particle overcomes two times the barrier @xmath116ev .",
    "in addition there three options to diffuse from the interstitial site .",
    "since only one option leads to our coarse - grained destination site , an additional geometric factor of @xmath118 needs to be included in the diffusion rate .",
