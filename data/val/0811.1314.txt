    "the remarkable progress in the experimental and theoretical studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite over the past two decades has sparked an intense study of the coherent nonlinear structures that arise in this setting .",
    "such structures are rather naturally expected to emerge due to a well - established mean - field description of becs by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , namely , a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , in which the nonlinearity is introduced by the interatomic interactions .",
    "this feature has inspired many relevant theoretical and experimental studies devoted to macroscopic nonlinear matter waves , such as bright matter - wave solitons in attractive becs @xcite , as well as dark @xcite and gap @xcite matter wave solitons in repulsive becs ( see also the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "one of the important elements of the versatility of this atomic physics setting is the existence of diverse types of external potentials in the gp equation accounting for the electric , magnetic , optical or combined confinement of ultracold dilute alkali vapors that constitute the bec .",
    "some of the most typical forms of such trapping potentials include a parabolic and a spatially periodic one ( created by the interference of counter - propagating laser beams , the so - called optical lattice ) .",
    "the nls equations with similar potentials are also relevant in the context of nonlinear optics , where they model the evolution of optical beams in graded - index waveguides and periodic waveguiding arrays @xcite .",
    "one interesting type of potential that has drawn a considerable amount of attention is the double - well potential .",
    "this may originate , for instance , from the combination of a parabolic with a periodic potential .",
    "its experimental realization was featured in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a variety of interesting phenomena were studied ; these include josephson oscillations and tunneling for a small number of atoms , or macroscopic quantum self - trapping and an asymmetric partition of the atoms between the wells for sufficiently large numbers of atoms . in parallel to these experimental findings ,",
    "numerous theoretical insights on this topic have emerged @xcite .",
    "these concerned finite - mode reductions , analytical results for specially designed shapes of the potential , quantum depletion effects , and other theoretical aspects .",
    "interestingly , double - well potentials have also been studied in applications arising in the context of nonlinear optics , including twin - core self - guided laser beams in kerr media @xcite , optically induced dual - core waveguiding structures in a photorefractive crystal @xcite , trapped light beams in a structured annular core of an optical fiber @xcite , and so on .",
    "it is relevant to point out here that double well settings have been examined not only in one - component systems , but also in multi - component cases . in particular , a recent study motivated by two - component becs can be found in @xcite , while similar attempts have been made in the context of the so - called spinor becs ( where it is possible to have three , and even five components ) in the works of @xcite .",
    "these works examined not only finite - mode reductions of the multi - component case , but also phenomena beyond the level of the mean - field description such as quantum entanglement and spin - squeezing properties .",
    "on the other hand , nonlinear matter - waves have not only been studied in a variety of external potentials , but also in the presence of temporally or spatially varying external fields manipulating the interatomic interactions .",
    "indeed , the s - wave scattering length ( which characterizes the nonlinearity coefficient in the gp equation ) can be adjusted experimentally by employing either magnetic @xcite or optical feshbach resonances @xcite in a very broad range .",
    "this flexibility of manipulation of the interatomic interactions has motivated a significant number of studies both on the theoretical and on the experimental front ; in particular , on the experimental side , the formation of bright matter - wave solitons and soliton trains for @xmath0li @xcite and @xmath1rb @xcite atoms used a tuning of the interatomic interactions from repulsive to attractive .",
    "also , this type of manipulations was instrumental in achieving the formation of molecular condensates @xcite , and the probing of the bec - bcs crossover @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical studies have predicted that a time - dependent modulation of the scattering length can be used to stabilize attractive higher - dimensional becs against collapse @xcite , or to create robust matter - wave breathers in lower - dimensional becs @xcite .",
    "while the above studies focused on temporal variations of the interaction strength , more recently spatial variations of the nonlinearity have come to be of interest in the so - called `` collisionally inhomogeneous '' environments .",
    "these have been found to lead to a variety of interesting developments including ( but not limited to ) adiabatic compression of matter - waves @xcite , bloch oscillations of matter - wave solitons @xcite , atomic soliton emission and atom lasers @xcite , enhancement of transmittivity of matter - waves through barriers @xcite , dynamical trapping of matter - wave solitons @xcite , stable condensates exhibiting both attractive and repulsive interatomic interactions @xcite , the delocalization transition of matter waves  @xcite , and so on .",
    "many different types of spatial variations of the nonlinearity have been considered , including linear @xcite , parabolic @xcite , random @xcite , periodic @xcite , and localized ( step - like ) @xcite ones .",
    "furthermore , a number of detailed mathematical studies @xcite have appeared , addressing aspects such as the effect of a  nonlinear lattice potential \" ( i.e. , a spatially periodic nonlinearity ) on the stability of matter - wave solitons , and the interplay between drift and diffraction / blow - up instabilities .",
    "more recently , the interplay of nonlinear and linear potentials has been examined in both continuum @xcite and discrete @xcite settings .    the aim of the present work is , in fact , to combine these two interesting settings , namely the double - well potential and a collisionally inhomogeneous ( i.e. , spatially dependent ) nonlinearity .",
    "as , arguably , one of the simplest forms of this combination , we select a coefficient of the nonlinearity which is piecewise constant , in line with the suggestions of @xcite and can vary between two ( smoothly connected ) pieces with the same sign , or even two pieces with opposite signs . the latter form of a spatially dependent nonlinearity appears to be one that should be straightforwardly experimentally realizable @xcite , through the use of magnetic field gradients of moderate size for atom chips ( see also the relevant discussion in @xcite ) . the phenomenology that we observe in this setting appears to be _ remarkably different _ from that of the standard double - well .",
    "in particular , as we detailed in an earlier relevant work @xcite , the linear states of the underlying potential can be continued into nonlinear ones in the presence of the pertinent cubic nonlinearity . as prototypical examples of these linear states",
    "one can consider the symmetric ground state and the anti - symmetric first excited state of the double - well potential .",
    "a remarkable feature , however , which takes place for sufficiently strong nonlinearity ( to the symmetric state for attractive interactions and to the anti - symmetric state for repulsive interactions ) is a symmetry - breaking bifurcation of the pitchfork type .",
    "this bifurcation generates two new asymmetric solutions ( which exist for sufficiently large nonlinearity ) .",
    "what we find here is that even a weak inhomogeneity in the collisional properties of the condensate changes the nature of this bifurcation from a pitchfork to a saddle - node one .",
    "this may be anticipated given the `` non - parametrically robust '' nature of the pitchfork bifurcation which will yield similar changes in the presence of different asymmetries ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to that , increasing the inhomogeneity strength shifts ( eventually to infinity ) the turning point of the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large variation of the nonlinear coefficient between the two wells , only two nonlinear states emanate from the ground and first excited states of the linear problem .",
    "furthermore , for one of these states , the monotonicity of the number of particles changes as a function of its nonlinear eigenvalue parameter ( i.e. , the chemical potential ) .",
    "this is a rather unusual feature that leads to a bifurcation diagram entirely different from those of the homogeneous interatomic interactions ( i.e. , homogeneous nonlinearity ) limit of either the one - component @xcite or of the multi - component system ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these traits are captured accurately , as we will show below , by a two - mode , galerkin - type approximation @xcite applied to the present collisionally inhomogeneous double well setting .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows .",
    "the model and the semi - analytical predictions regarding its stationary solutions are presented in section ii . our corresponding directly numerical findings and their comparison with the analysis are given in section iii . in section iv , we present an alternative theoretical viewpoint more akin to the model dynamics and compare its results to the full results of the partial differential equation . finally , in section v , we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "the dynamics of a quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) condensate , oriented along the @xmath2-axis , can be described by the following gp equation ( see , e.g. , ch . 1 in @xcite and @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean - field order parameter , @xmath5 is the atomic mass , and @xmath6 is the chemical potential of the effectively 1d system .",
    "the nonlinear coefficient @xmath7 arises from the interatomic interactions and has an effective 1d form , namely @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the transverse confining frequency and @xmath10 is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) s - wave scattering length ( the cases @xmath11 or @xmath12 correspond , respectively , to repulsive or attractive interatomic interactions ) .",
    "the external potential @xmath13 in the gp eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) consists of a regular harmonic trap and a repulsive potential localized at the harmonic trap center , namely , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the longitudinal confining frequency , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the strength and width of the localized potential ; the latter is in fact a barrier potential that may be created by a blue - detuned laser beam , repelling the atoms in the condensate .",
    "it is clear that the combination of the harmonic trap and the barrier potential is in fact a double - well potential .",
    "moreover , we assume that the collisional properties of the condensate are spatially inhomogeneous , i.e. , @xmath18 , with the function @xmath19 taking different , but smoothly connected , values in the two wells of the external potential .",
    "in particular , we consider that an external magnetic or optical field ( see below ) modifies the scattering length of the condensate as follows , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constant values of the condensate s scattering length in the absence and in the presence of the external field , respectively , which are smoothly connected through the @xmath23 function ( here , @xmath24 is the spatial length scale on which the transition between the two values @xmath21 and @xmath22 takes place ) . apparently , far away from the harmonic trap center at @xmath25 ( or , in other words , far away from the barrier ) , the scattering length takes the values @xmath26 , for @xmath27 respectively .",
    "such an inhomogeneity of the scattering length may be realized in practice upon employing a bias homogeneous field and imposing a steep localized gradient on top of it .",
    "in such a case , in a quasi 1d configuration ( as is the case under consideration ) this will lead to a constant scattering length with value @xmath28 in the left well , which is followed by a localized change of @xmath10 , finally ending up with a second value @xmath29 in the right well .",
    "notice that in our model we choose the function @xmath23 to analytically describe the transition between these different constant values of @xmath10 since there are no ideal steps , but rather close approximations to it .",
    "also , we naturally assume that we are relatively close to a feshbach resonance , in order to easily manipulate the scattering length with the external field .",
    "next , measuring time in units of the inverse transverse trapping frequency @xmath30 , length in units of the transverse oscillator length @xmath31 , energy in units of @xmath32 , and introducing the normalized wavefunction @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is a reference value of the scattering length ) , we reduce the gp eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) to the following dimensionless form : @xmath35 in the above equation , @xmath36 is the `` single - particle '' operator in the normalized external potential @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the normalized harmonic trap strength and @xmath39 .",
    "the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "apparently , the cases @xmath45 or @xmath46 correspond to repulsive or attractive interactions , respectively .",
    "we finally mention that the number of particles in the condensate @xmath47 is now defined as @xmath47@xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an integral of motion ( normalized mumber of particles ) of the gp eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) . also , in our analysis ( and particularly in the typical numerical results that will be presented below ) we will assume fixed parameter values @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in the non - interacting limit [ i.e. , for @xmath54 , the spectrum of the underlying linear schrdinger equation consists of a ground state , @xmath55 , and excited states , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "our analytical investigation of the nonlinear problem ( at the stationary level ) in the weakly nonlinear regime consists of applying a galerkin - type , two - mode approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we assume that the wavefunction @xmath58 can be decomposed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are unknown time - dependent complex prefactors . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and projecting the resulting equation to eigenfunctions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we obtain the following equations : @xmath64 in these equations , dots denote time derivatives , stars denote complex conjugates , and @xmath65 are the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenstates @xmath66 ; in the numerical examples presented herein , @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be numerically found to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "we should note in passing here that although @xmath65 and @xmath66 are numerically obtained through a simple eigensolver of the underlying linear schrdinger problem , it is also , in principle , possible to develop a perturbative approach towards obtaining such eigenvalues and eigenvectors following the work of @xcite , rendering our semi - analytical approach developed below more proximal to a fully analytical one .",
    "the overlap integrals @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constants . notice that @xmath55 and @xmath76 are both real functions ( due to the hermitian nature of the underlying linear schrdinger problem ) and are also orthonormal . in",
    "what follows , in the definition of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , we will set @xmath77 with @xmath78 , as shown in fig .",
    "notice that in the limiting case @xmath79 , the nonlinearity coefficient takes a constant value , @xmath80 , and the problem is reduced to the study of a collisionally homogeneous condensate with attractive interatomic interactions in a double well potential ; this problem was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of the considered two - mode approximation for both symmetric and asymmetric double - well potentials . as a result of this choice and of fixing the rest of the parameters , the above overlap integrals @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are functions of @xmath86 and their dependence on this parameter is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] provide specific examples of the profiles of this continuation .",

    "[ fig8 ] ( e.g. , in its left panel ) , where it is principally defocusing , one of the branches changes its monotonicity , as a result of the spatially dependent nonlinearity . as indicated previously , given the slope condition of the vakhitov - kolokolov criterion @xcite , it appears to be rather surprising that this change of monotonicity is not accompanied by a change of stability .",
    "however , we argue here that it is not . defining",
    "the well known linearization operators @xmath147 it is known from the work of @xcite that when @xmath148 [ i.e. , the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath149 minus the negative eigenvalues of @xmath150 is in absolute value equal to 1 ] , instability arises when the slope condition of vakhitov - kolokolov is violated . since",
    ", when @xmath151 , the relevant theory indicates that the solution is always unstable , we argue that what should be happening here is that the violation of the slope condition of vakhitov - kolokolov is not associated with an instability because it occurs at the same time as the change of the count of @xmath152 ( from @xmath103 to @xmath104 or vice versa ) .",
    "this is precisely what we numerically illustrate in fig .",
    "[ figln ] . in particular , the left panel concerns the principally focusing case associated to the first excited state `` turning branch '' of fig .",
    "there , given the fact that @xmath153 ( due to the one zero - crossing of the configuration itself , which is an eigenfunction of @xmath150 with a @xmath104 eigenvalue ) , we expect the count of eigenvalues @xmath154 to change from @xmath155 to @xmath103 exactly at the critical point , precisely as observed in the figure . on the other hand , the right panel concerning the ground state branch of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for the principally defocusing case , corresponds to a case with @xmath156 .",
    "hence , when the slope condition is violated ( near the linear limit in this case ) , it has to be true that @xmath157 , while after the turning point of the branch , the slope condition is satisfied and then @xmath158 , which again is consonant with the observed stability .",
    "these features are clearly illustrated in the right panel of fig .",

    "so far , we have considered the two - mode reduction as a tool for identifying ( quite successfully , as shown above ) the stationary states of the underlying problem .",
    "however , here we illustrate how the same tool can be used to understand the system dynamics .",
    "the two principal dynamical features of the ( symmetric ) double well system involve the oscillations of matter between the two wells ( for low population asymmetries between the wells ) and the nonlinearly induced self - trapping regime ( for high population asymmetries between the wells ) ; see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for this reason , although our setting here is inherently asymmetric ( due to the nature of @xmath40 ) , it is of interest to develop a variant of the two - mode approximation that accounts for the population imbalance between the wells .    in order to formulate the problem based on the populations of the left and right well",
    ", one can reformulate our two - mode decomposition as @xmath159 where it is clear that @xmath160 and @xmath161 are connected with @xmath162 and @xmath163 through a simple linear transformation .",
    "if we then decompose @xmath164 @xmath165 and define the phase difference @xmath166 , and the population imbalance @xmath167 ( recall that @xmath168 ) , one can then project the equation to @xmath169 , as well as to @xmath170 and eventually obtain the dynamical equations for the conjugate variables @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "these read : @xmath173 it is interesting to examine the dynamical evolution of these equations ( their stationary states are identical to the ones identified above ) , and to compare their dynamics with the corresponding pde dynamics .",
    "in the latter , one can also make similar projections to @xmath169 , as well as to @xmath170 and define accordingly @xmath174 , as well as thereafter @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath175 phase space for different @xmath86 of such canonically conjugate variables can be found in fig .",
    "[ figadd1 ] .",
    "it can be clearly observed that for non - zero @xmath86 the reflection symmetry around @xmath176 is broken . for increasing @xmath86 the population imbalance of the stationary states shifts towards larger values of @xmath171 ( see also fig .",
    "[ figadd2 ] ) , denoting a larger occupation of the right well compared to the left one .",
    "this can be understood by taking into account that we consider the case of repulsive interaction .",
    "there , an increase of @xmath86 implies a reduction of interaction in the right well ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "so , pictorially speaking , the atoms feel less repulsion in the right well than in the left one , leading to the observed population imbalance . for small populational asymmetries ( around the nonzero stationary ones )",
    ", the system executes inter - well matter - transfer oscillations .",
    "on the other hand , beyond a critical asymmetry in the initial populations , we enter the self - trapping regime , as is shown both in the partial differential equation of the full dynamics and in the above reduced two - mode description of eqs .",

    "there , it is highlighted how the effect of a reduced barrier height of the trapping potential or increased interactions can deteriorate the dynamical effectiveness of the two - mode reduction .",
    "here we explore the role of the collisional inhomogeneity in affecting the accuracy of this reduction , by illustrating a prototypical diagnostic , namely the critical population imbalance threshold beyond which self - trapping occurs , as this is identified in the full dynamical equation and as it is obtained within the two - mode reduction .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figadd2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that as @xmath86 increases , both critical points ( the positive and the negative one ) increase .",
    "the positive one vanishes when it is equal to the total number of atoms . by comparing the results obtained by solving the pde with the results of the odes",
    "one observes that the two - mode approximation becomes less accurate , as @xmath86 increases , in capturing the corresponding threshold , a feature that we have also seen regarding stationary state properties ; see e.g. fig .",
    "in this paper , we studied in detail the nature of the most fundamental matter - waves ( emanating from the linear limit of the problem ) that emerge from a quasi-1d collisionally inhomogeneous bose - einstein condensate trapped in a double - well potential .",
    "we specifically considered a setup which features distinct scattering lengths between the two wells , including also the case where the nonlinearity coefficient of the pertinent gross - pitaevskii equation has different signs in the the two wells .",
    "we observed that the relevant phenomenology is different in the considered collisionally inhomogeneous environment in comparison to the collisionally homogeneous case studied previously .",
    "in particular , even for weak inhomogeneities , the asymmetry ( that the spatial dependence of the nonlinearity introduces ) induces a modification of the bifurcation picture of the double - well potential and a change in the nature of the symmetry - breaking bifurcation from a pitchfork to a saddle - node ; this is reminiscent of similar modifications to the bifurcation picture due to asymmetries of the linear potential @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was found that as the strength of the inhomogeneity is increased , even this saddle - node `` recollection '' of the symmetry - breaking bifurcation eventually disappears ( the corresponding critical point is pushed to infinity ) and only one nonlinear branch persists that corresponds to each state of the problem s linear limit . interestingly also , as the inhomogeneity acquires opposite sign values of the scattering length , the monotonicity of the number of atoms dependence on the chemical potential may change ( and may even be different between the two branches ) , although they do maintain their stability ( which presents an interesting deviation in this spatially inhomogeneous case from the well - known vakhitov - kolokolov criterion that we rationalized in detail above ) .",
    "all of this phenomenology , including the detailed bifurcation diagram and other specific features , such as the critical point of the saddle - node bifurcation and its dependence on the degree of inhomogeneity , are captured remarkably accurately by a galerkin - type , two - mode approximation and a resulting simple set of algebraic equations .",
    "finally , we also briefly discussed dynamical aspects of the system including a phase space reduction in the population imbalance - interwell phase difference space .",
    "we have illustrated that despite the ensuing asymmetry in the phase space ( for positive vs. negative population imbalances ) , the two - mode reduction can accurately capture the threshold of transition from josephson matter - wave oscillations to nonlinearly induced self - trapping ( especially so for weak collisional inhomogeneities ) .",
    "our investigation herein presents some testable predictions for the original physical system and its realization in atomic physics or , also possibly , in nonlinear optics @xcite ; in particular , as the nonlinearity becomes increasingly different in the two wells , the emergence of additional states should be occurring for increasingly larger number of atoms and eventually , such additional states ( in particular , the stable one among them ) should no longer be observable .",
    "it would be of particular interest if such spatial variations of the nonlinearity could be experimentally realized , which would allow the direct testing of our theoretical predictions .",
