    "experiments usually measure a signal ( light , atoms , particles current etc ) which comes out from the system of interest . if the open set ( the escape point or hole ) of the physical device , where the signal comes out , has a relevant size and shape , the signal may include informations from inside the physical device _ and _ from the open set itself .",
    "the shape and size of the open set depends on experimental interests but also on how the device is build . for the dynamics in mesoscopic systems and nanostructures , for example",
    ", the shape and the size of the small open set can present irregularities or defects which may induce undesirable changes in the outcoming signal . such sometimes intrinsic irregularities affect the dynamics of particles which collide with them .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is very difficult to describe , in general , the dynamics of colliding particles with irregular boundaries .",
    "therefore in recent years more and more attention has been given to the description of particles confined inside boundaries ( or billiards ) which present some _ specific _ edges , softness etc .",
    "to mention some examples we have the edge roughness in quantum dots @xcite , unusual boundary conditions in two - dimensional billiards @xcite , effects of soft walls @xcite and edge collisions @xcite of interacting particles in a 1d billiard , rounding edge @xcite and edge corrections @xcite in a resonator , deformation of dielectric cavities @xcite , edge diffractions and the corresponding semiclassical quantization @xcite , among others .",
    "different from the above works , which focus on the boundaries of systems , here we analyze the effect of irregularities from the open set itself .",
    "what is the effect of ( rounded ) open sets on the outcoming signal ? to mention some examples , rounded open sets are common in experiments with semiconductors devices @xcite and quantum cavities @xcite , where the open sets have a shape very similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ model - border ] , which is the model used here ( type i and ii ) . in the above mentioned experiments",
    "the ratio between the open set ( not its width , but the radius of the rounded border ) and the whole device lies around @xmath2 for type ii borders ( the smallest case ) and around @xmath3 for type i borders ( the largest case ) . since experiments measure a signal which comes out from the system of interest , how is it affected by such rounded borders ?",
    "is it possible that tiny rounded borders transform an integrable dynamics into a chaotic one ?",
    "what is their influence on the dynamics in open nanodevices , conduction fluctuations in semiconductors @xcite , particles transport in nanostructures , cold atoms in open optical billiards @xcite etc ?",
    "recent works @xcite in this direction analyzed the effect of the _ width _ of the open set on the escape rates of particles in open billiards .",
    "using the example of a billiard model we show here that the _ shape _ or _",
    "structure _ of the open set induces stickiness @xcite , self - similar and a chaotic output signal , even if the dynamics inside the billiard is originally regular .",
    "we consider that the device borders ( or extremities ) , which delimit the holes in realistic open systems , are not single points , but have their own shape . in this work results",
    "are shown for the escape times ( ets ) statistics and the emission angles @xmath4 in the open rectangular billiard shown in fig .",
    "[ model - border ] . while self - similar structures are clearly visible in the ets and escape angles , the sticky motion is observed by the power law decay of the ets statistic .",
    "although it is possible to detect and quantify sticky motion via the distribution of finite time lyapunov exponents @xcite , for the purpose of the present work it is more adequate to use the ets statistics .",
    "the fractal behavior of the ets dynamics was also shown recently in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , trapped ultracold atoms @xcite and in a vase - shaped cavity @xcite , in generic chaotic cavities @xcite , just to mention some examples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ model ] presents the model , defines the ets used to detect the sticky behavior and shows related numerical results .",
    "sections  [ dynamics ] and [ backgammon ] show the rich dynamics generated by the rounded border : long - lived states and self - similar structures for the ets and emission angles . in section  [ conclusions ]",
    "we present our final remarks .",
    "the ets statistic is defined @xcite by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total number of trajectories which escape the billiard and @xmath7 is the number of trajectories which escape the billiard after the time @xmath8 . for systems with stickiness",
    "the ets statistic decays as a power law @xcite @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scaling exponent . for hyperbolic chaotic systems and long times",
    "the ets statistic decays exponentially .",

    "the particle suffers elastic collisions at the billiard boundaries and at the rounded border of the open set . for each initial condition",
    "we wait until the particle leaves the billiard and record @xmath4 and the ets .",

    "the rectangular billiard is integrable and has zero lyapunov exponents .",
    "as the ratio @xmath29 increases , the rounded border acts like a dispersing boundary generating chaotic motion without regular islands . for larger values of @xmath29 and some specific initial conditions",
    ", the dynamics should be equivalent to those obtained in the sinai @xcite and bunimovich stadium @xcite billiards .",
    "these billiard have marginally unstable periodic orbits ( mupos ) , which are orbits bouncing perpendicularly between the parallel walls , and are known @xcite to generate the sticky exponent @xmath30 for the ets . in the rectangular billiard the mupos are obtained from the initial conditions @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , in our case we also expect to see @xmath32 as @xmath29 increases .",

    "first observation is that for @xmath42 , @xmath33 did not has a power law ( neither an exponential decay ) .",
    "this is the integrable case and the maximal et found is @xmath43 .",
    "such maximal time is obtained because we did not start initial conditions close to the mupos ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "separately ( not shown ) we used only initial conditions very close to the mupos .",
    "we found that @xmath33 did not have a finite maximal time , but a power law tail for very long times with @xmath44 .",
    "this shows that the mupos without the dispersing component ( and no chaotic motion ) , does not generates the exponent @xmath45 .",
    "this agrees with results obtained @xcite for some specific initial conditions in an open billiard .    for very small rounding effects , @xmath46 , the qualitative behavior of",
    "@xmath33 starts to change ( when compared to the case @xmath42 ) for times @xmath47 , i.  e.  for those trajectories which stay longer inside the billiard .",
    "this means that the very few trajectories which collide with the rounded border tend to stay longer inside the billiard and also change the qualitative behavior of @xmath33 .",
    "the fitted escape exponent is @xmath48 . by increasing the border to @xmath49 ,",

    "we obtain @xmath54 and for @xmath55 and @xmath56 we obtain @xmath57 . from these points is it possible to get @xmath58 and consequently we obtain the anomalous exponent @xmath59 for the sticky region .",
    "the ets from the long living trajectories present significant characteristics of sticky motion for @xmath60 .",
    "in other words , sticky motion and long living trajectories start to occur for _ very _ small rounding borders : around @xmath0 from the whole billiard size is sufficient to generate the sticky motion and change the output signal . visually such borders are almost negligible .",

    "trajectories which start inside the backgammon stripes will collide , at least once , with the rounded border , generating the power law behavior . as @xmath29 increases more and more , different backgammon stripes start to overlap and the exponent @xmath104 is obtained . for @xmath105 the exponential decay for the escape times is reached , which corresponds to the chaotic motion .    from the nonlinear perspective",
    "our results are impressive , showing that a very rich dynamics and stickiness comes alone from tiny border effects ( @xmath106 ) in integrable billiards .",
    "such effects , including the arnold tongues , should be visible directly in experiments with open integrable devices , open systems with leaks ( see @xcite and therein cited references ) and also in problems related to conduction fluctuations in semiconductors @xcite , particles transport in nanostructures and cold atoms in open optical billiards @xcite .    instead of rounded borders , other shapes for the open sets could be used .",
    "all of them should generate sticky motion in integrable billiards , strongly affecting the outcoming signal .",
    "our results will change quantitatively when the aperture @xmath77 increases , however , in such cases long - lived trajectories will disappear and the statistical analysis for the escape times is not adequate anymore . in this work we considered an integrable billiard as the starting point .",
    "we also performed extensive numerical simulations to study rounded border effects in the stadium billiard , which is already chaotic without border effects ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "for all values of @xmath29 we found that the escape times statistic has an exponential decay , expected for the chaotic behavior ."
