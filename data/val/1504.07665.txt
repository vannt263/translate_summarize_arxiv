    "colloidal suspensions are systems consisting of small particles of sizes from tens to hundreds nanometers dispersed in a solvent  @xcite",
    ". the particles can form colloidal crystals not only in three dimensions ( 3d )  @xcite but also in two dimensions ( 2d ) where they create a hexagonal lattice  @xcite .",
    "when particles are endowed with electrical charge and placed in a dispersing medium , they exhibit exponential decay of electric potential due to screening effect from ions in the solvent  @xcite .",
    "this decay is described by the _ screening length _",
    "@xmath1 ( known also as the _ debye length _ ) which depends on temperature , permittivity , and concentration of ions in the solvent .",
    "interactions between particles in such systems are decribed by hard  core repulsive yukawa potential ( hcryp )  @xcite , both in two  @xcite and three  @xcite dimensions .",
    "the potential consists of two parts : the hard core ( reflecting the influence of finite sizes of particles ) and the repulsive part describing spherically symmetric coulomb screening effect .",
    "hcryp systems can behave ( depending on @xmath1 ) as hard particle systems ( perfect screening ) or as wigner crystal ( no screening )  @xcite .",
    "more than ten years ago the liquid  solid phase diagrams for two - dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d )  @xcite hcryp systems have been studied .",
    "the research showed that in 2d hcryp particles can crystallize into a hexagonal lattice , whereas the in 3d they form f.c.c . or b.c.c . structures ( depending on external conditions ) .",
    "various thermodynamic properties and physical phenomena have been studied for the yukawa potential , both in 2d  @xcite and 3d  @xcite .",
    "recently the elastic properties of three dimensional monodisperse yukawa system were studied and it was shown that the system is _ partially auxetic _  @xcite .",
    "the term _ auxetic _  @xcite refers to the class of materials and models that exhibit unusual elastic properties .",
    "they expand ( shrink ) transversally when stretched ( compressed ) longitudinally .",
    "their poisson s ratio  @xcite ( in contrast to common materials ) is _",
    "negative_. due to their exceptional properties , auxetic materials and models gather ever growing interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that usually colloidal systems are not composed of identical particles .",
    "thus it is meaningful to consider the enhancement of the model by introduction of the particle size dispersion  @xcite .",
    "the study shows that the dispersion in sizes of particles can significantly impact the thermodynamic  @xcite ( especially elastic  @xcite ) properties of the system .",
    "the study of polydisperse hard disks system not only indicated a strong dependence of elastic constants on particles size polydispersity , but also revealed surprising behaviour of the poisson s ratio in the close  packing limit  @xcite . in this context , the subject of this work are both mono and polydisperse systems .",

    "is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the elastic moduli as functions of density for @xmath53 are presented there .",
    "one can observe a monotonic increase of both elastic moduli and pressure with increasing density .",
    "a decrease of the temperature results in an increase of pressure and elastic moduli at entire range of studied densities .",

    "it is immediately apparent that for selected @xmath54 values of poisson s ratio for different temperatures are very close one to another at high densities .",
    "this suggests that the influence of particles hard cores becomes dominant at these densities . at low densities",
    "an increase of temperature causes an increase of the poisson s ratio , however the dependence on temperature is rather weak .",

    "however , the growth rate of the elastic moduli is different and it clearly depends on the screening length .",
    "an increase of the elastic moduli with increasing density is slower for long  range potential ( @xmath56 ) than for interactions with shorter screening length ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3]d illustrates the dependence of poisson s ratio on density for systems with different screening lengths .",
    "it is noticeable that for a given @xmath54 the poisson s ratio weakly depends on the density of the system .",
    "however , the screening length itself essentially influences the value of poisson s ratio .",
    "this leads to conclusion that one can control the poisson s ratio by modifying the debye screening length ( e.g. by changing the properties of the electrolyte ) .",
    "of the particles hard cores on elastic properties is discussed in this section .",
    "one can start from the examination of the equation of state presented in the figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "as in the previous case , presented data correspond to systems at reduced temperature @xmath55 for three values of screening length @xmath50 : @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the choice of these values is dictated by two factors .",
    "firstly , studies of poisson s ratio in case of monodisperse system ( see sec .  [ subsec_ks ] ) showed that its temperature dependence is rather week while the screening length has a significant impact on its value .",
    "secondly , the present study is mainly focused on looking for mechanisms affecting poisson s ratio .",
    "thus the influence of the screening length on the elastic properties and poisson s ratio in systems with non - zero polydispersity of particles sizes was considered at a selected ( constant ) temperature .",
    "systems with four different values of polydispersity parameter @xmath20 have been investigated .",
    "its influence manifests as the change of number density ( i.e. the ratio of the number of particles per 2d volume ) for a given pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "an increase of the size polydispersity causes a decrease of the number density at a given pressure .",
    "the decrease , however , depends on the screening length . for long  range interactions ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) the impact of size dispersion is significantly smaller and noticeable only at high pressures .",
    "once the screening length is getting smaller ( increasing @xmath54 ) , rising @xmath20 enforces the system to expand even at lower pressures .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates changes of elastic moduli caused by the size polydispersity relative to monodisperse system for different screening lengths . the relations are presented as functions of density .",
    "one can notice that the influence of the size polydispersity is very different for both the moduli . in the case of the bulk modulus",
    ", a significant increase can be observed only for high densities and long interactions ( fig  [ fig5]a ) . for lower densities",
    "the influence of the size polydispersity on the bulk modulus is negligible .",
    "furthermore , when the effect of particles hard cores becomes dominant ( increasing @xmath54 ) , one can observe only minor impact of the non  zero polydispersity on @xmath16 in the whole range of studied densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]c ) .",
    "this effect is further illustrated in the figure  [ fig6]a , where the relative bulk modulus with respect the polydispersity parameter is presented for three screening lengths at high and low pressures .",
    "it can be seen there that only for long  range interactions and high pressure one can observe a significant influence of polydispersity on the bulk modulus , and this impact quickly decays with the decrease of the screening length .",
    "the effect of the size polydispersity on the shear modulus @xmath3 is stronger than on the bulk modulus . in figure",
    "[ fig5]a one can see that an increase of @xmath20 decreases the shear modulus . from the other hand shortening of the screening length",
    "increases an influence of the polydispersity on the shear modulus  ( fig .  [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "thus , one can conclude that for a system with given size polydispersity of particles one can additionally control its ( the system ) susceptibility to the shear deformations by changing the debye screening length ( e.g. by modifying the properties of the electrolyte ) . unlike the bulk modulus , pressure has a little impact on a decrease of @xmath3 with the increasing parameter of polydispersity ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) . only in the case of shortest screening lengths ( @xmath47 )",
    "the difference between the considered properties of systems under low and high pressures is noticeable . for smaller values of @xmath54",
    "only an increase of the polydispersity parameter is responsible for a decrease of the shear modulus .",
    "it is worth noting , that most significant decrease of the shear modulus is observed for the shortest screening length .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the density dependence of the poisson s ratio for different values of polydispersity parameter and various screening lengths .",
    "it can be seen that for long - range interactions the size polydispersity of particles affects weakly the poisson s ratio and it weakly depends on the density . with shortening the screening length ,",
    "the impact of polydispersity becomes more noticeable , getting very significant role for the short - range interactions .",
    "the influence of the temperature , screening lengths and size polydispersity on elastic properties of the two - dimensional hexagonal structure of hard  core , repulsive yukawa particles was investigated by monte carlo simulations in the @xmath0 ensemble with variable shape of the periodic box .",
    "the obtained results show that influence of the screening length on the elastic properties of the studied systems is significant .",
    "it was also shown that size polydispersity impacts the elastic properties , especially the shear modulus , which decreases with decreasing the size polydispersity parameter .",
    "however , an increase of particle size dispersion is reflected in the increase of poisson s ratio .",
    "it was shown that the 2d yukawa model is non ",
    "auxetic but the value of the poisson s ratio decreases with decreasing screening length .",
