    "quasars are routinely used as background sources , allowing us to study intervening gaseous structures via absorption - line diagnostics .",
    "the observed absorption lines have their origin in both _ intervening _ objects , such as foreground galaxies , the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , or the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the quasar host galaxies , and in structures that are _ intrinsic _ to the quasars .    a promising candidate for the intrinsic absorbers is an outflowing wind from the accretion disk that makes up the quasar central engine .",
    "the outflow is thought to be accelerated by either magnetocentrifugal forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by radiation pressure in lines and continuum @xcite , and/or by radiation pressure acting on dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to many of the above models , the flow can be equatorial , although the opening angle relative to the plane of the disk depends on the choice of model parameters . in other models , the flow can be polar ( directed at right angles to the disk plane ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outflowing winds are important in two ways .",
    "first , they may be essential components of the quasar central engine : they can carry angular momentum away from the disk , allowing accretion onto the black hole to proceed .",
    "second , they can deliver energy and momentum to the ism and igm , thus regulating gas infall and star formation during the assembly of a galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , feedback from quasar outflows can profoundly affect the properties of present - day galaxies and it can also enrich the igm with metals . for these reasons , it is important to understand the properties and structure of quasar outflows , a goal which can be accomplished by studying the absorption lines that they produce .",
    "spectra of quasars , the _ broad _ absorption lines ( hereafter , _ bals _ ; fwhm @xmath5 2000  ) are easily identified as intrinsic .",
    "the large widths of bals make them very unlikely to originate in intervening objects or the interstellar medium of the quasar host galaxy .",
    "bals are detected in 1020% of optically selected quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the detection rate is slightly higher in radio - quiet quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed fraction of quasars hosting bals constrains the solid angle subtended by the dense portion of the wind to the central engine .",
    "narrow absorption lines observed in the spectra of quasars ( hereafter _ nals _ ; fwhm @xmath6 500  ) are also physically associated with the quasars .",
    "this was motivated by the fact that the detection rate of nals varies between sight - lines and is related to the physical properties of the background quasars @xcite .",
    "such a trend is not expected , if all nals arise in intervening absorbers .",
    "this suggestion was confirmed once nals were completely de - blended into multiple narrower components with high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we can now separate intrinsic nals from intervening ones , via two characteristic properties related to the compactness of the gas parcels in intrinsic absorbers : ( a ) dilution of absorption troughs by un - occulted light from the background source(s ) associated with the quasar ( hereafter `` partial coverage '' ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( b ) time variability of line profiles ( e.g. , depth , equivalent width , line centroid ) , within @xmath71  yr in the quasar rest frame ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "neither of these properties is expected in intervening absorbers because they have much larger sizes and lower densities compared to intrinsic absorbers . using the former test , @xcite find that @xmath450%of non - bal qsos at @xmath84 have at least one intrinsic nal in their rest - frame , near - uv spectra .",
    "equally useful , but less common , are _ mini - bals _ , with intermediate line widths between nals and bals ( 500  @xmath6 fwhm @xmath6 2,000  ) .",
    "mini - bals are also identified by partial coverage and/or time variability .",
    "however , they can also be identified just from their smooth and relatively broad profiles , which is incompatible with the properties of intervening gaseous structures .",
    "mini - bals have the advantages of both bals ( i.e. , high probability of being intrinsic ) and nals ( i.e. , line profiles can be resolved into individual components ) , which makes them useful as diagnostics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "bals , mini - bals , and nals could be complementary probes of quasar outflows since they may be observed along different lines of sight towards the quasar continuum and/or emission line source .",
    "this idea is bolstered by the results of x - ray observations by @xcite and @xcite , which show that the nal velocities and the column densities of the corresponding x - ray absorbers follow a different relation than bals .      as a pilot variability study of mini - bals",
    ", we have been monitoring a mini - bal in the optically bright quasar hs  1603 + 3820 ( @xmath9 ) using primarily the high - dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the subaru telescope @xcite .",
    "this mini - bal spans a range of blueshifts of 8,30010,600  relative to the quasar and shows both partial coverage and time variability .",
    "our monitoring campaign spans more than four years ( corresponding to about one year in the quasar rest - frame ) .",
    "no correlations are seen between the profile model parameters , except for a possible correlation between total equivalent width and the coverage fraction ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "as argued by @xcite , simple changes of ionization state or motion of a homogeneous gas parcel can not reproduce the observed variations .",
    "the former requires much faster variations of the uv continuum flux than one would expect from such a luminous quasar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter requires that all the absorbing parcels of gas ( that correspond to each of the absorption troughs ) are at the same distance from the continuum source and cross our cylinder of sight at the same time and without discernible changes in their line - of - sight velocities , which is rather unlikely .",
    "only two plausible scenarios remain for the origin of the variability : ( a ) continuum photons , redirected by a variable scattering medium into our cylinder of sight , dilute the mini - bal absorption and modulate its equivalent width according to the ( variable ) intensity of the scattered light ( depicted in figure  1a ) , and ( b ) rapid continuum fluctuations , coupled with coverage fraction fluctuations caused by a porous / clumpy screen of variable optical depth located between the continuum source and the mini - bal gas ( figure  1b ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of these scenarios is presented in @xcite .",
    "a third possibility , not discussed explicitly by @xcite , is that the scattering medium surrounds the absorber itself , as depicted in figure  1c .    )",
    ".,width=302 ]      the scattering scenario for the variability of the mini - bal in hs  1603 + 3820 can be tested through spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "polarimetry and spectropolarimetry of bal and non - bal qsos shows that the former are _ on average _ more polarized than the latter , in the continuum .",
    "however , the distribution of bal polarization levels is broad , with values between 0% and 8% ( or even higher in some cases ) .",
    "in contrast , non - bal qsos have polarization levels less than 2.5% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see , for example , figure1 in the latter paper ) .",
    "of more interest here is the change of polarization level between the continuum and the bal troughs .",
    "the implications of those observations form the basis for our observational test .",
    "the bal troughs are generally significantly more polarized than the continuum .",
    "the degree of polarization in the bal troughs can reach 1215% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are however examples where the bal troughs are actually unpolarized ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a particularly interesting case ) .",
    "two families of explanations for the observed increase in the polarization level in bal troughs have been discussed in the literature : ( a ) large - angle scattering from a medium that is off the cylinder of sight to the background source .",
    "thus the scattered photons , which are also unattenuated , make up a significant fraction of the residual light in the bal troughs and increase the degree of polarization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( b ) resonant scattering within the absorber itself can also produce polarization with a level as high as 15% in the trough ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * e.g. , ) .",
    "the former scenario appears more promising , because of the observed anti - correlations the degree of polarization ( @xmath3 ) and the detachment index ( di ) , and between the spectropolarimetric index ( si ) relative to the absorption in the direct flux @xmath10 @xcite . ] and di , which argue for the presence of a scattering medium in the polar direction @xcite .    in this paper , we present the results of spectropolarimetry of the mini - bal quasar , hs  1603 + 3820 .",
    "using our data , we search for variations in the degree of polarization across the mini - bal trough . the detection of a strong polarization signal in the mini - bal trough would lead us to infer that ( a ) scattering of photons around the absorber contributes to the partial coverage , and ( b ) the variability of the mini - bal can be caused by fluctuations in the amount of scattered light , as depicted in figure  1a .",
    "furthermore , we would also expect this fractional polarization to increase as the coverage fraction decreases .    in  2",
    ", we describe the observations and data reduction and in  3 we describe the spectropolarimetric properties of hs  1603 + 3820 . in  4 , we discuss the constraints placed by our observations on possible scattering mechanisms in hs  1603 + 3820 and we evaluate the scenarios for the variability of the mini - bal in light of the new data .",

    "the detector is a mosaic of two 4k@xmath122k mit ccds with 15@xmath13 m pixels .",
    "all the observations were carried out through a polarimetric unit that consists of a rotating superachromatic half - wave plate and a quartz wollaston prism . since the circular polarization is negligible for qsos , we measured only linear polarization .",
    "we used a 08 slit , the 600 mm@xmath14 vph grism ( 600_520 nm ) , and the l600 order - sorting filter .",

    "we do not discuss scenarios involving dust scattering although we do note that they suffer from the following drawback : the grains must be close to the continuum source so as not to scatter a significant fraction of belr photons , but then they will not be able to survive the intense radiation field at this distance .",

    "a non - uniform , anisotropic `` corona '' around the    continuum source is a candidate scattering medium ( figure  1a ) . in the    case we are considering here",
    ", this mechanism could operate only to a    small degree , i.e. , the fraction of light that is scattered must be    small so that it does not lead to a measurable increase in the    polarization within the mini - bal trough . : :    _ ( ii ) electron scattering around the absorber . ",
    "_ this mechanism is    similar to the previous one , but the scattering medium surrounds the    absorber , not the continuum source ( figure  1c ) .",
    "this corona could be    the highly ionized atmosphere of the absorbing gas parcel .",
    "the degree    of polarization depends on the absorber s size and distance from the    continuum source , as well as its geometry .",
    "thus , a filamentary    absorber with an extended scattering corona , located very close to the    source is disfavored because in such a case the scattering angle    ( denoted by @xmath42 in figure  1c ) is large and the scattered    photons will have a large polarization , in contradiction with our    observations . on the other hand ,",
    "if the absorber is very far from the    background source ( such that the extent of the scatering medium is    much smaller than the distance from the background source ) , the    scattering angle is inevitably small and so is the resulting    polarization .",
    "such a scenario remains viable in view of our results .",
    "in fact , the plausibility of this scenario is reinforced by the    finding that the absorbers in some quasars are located at distances of    several kiloparsec or more from the continuum source ( * ? ? ?",

    "the predicted polarization levels in the    absorption troughs are @xmath4315% depending on the    geometry , which is in contradiction with our observations thus , we    consider resonance scattering unlikely .",
    "considering the results of our spectropolarimetric observation , we can reject with some confidence the large - angle scattering scenario ( figure  1a ) as the cause of partial coverage , hence the origin of variability of the mini - bal in hs  1603 + 3820 . the primary argument against this scenario",
    "is that the polarization level remains low in the mini - bal trough and similar to the level out of the trough .",
    "the absorption depth of the mini - bal in the observation presented here is clearly smaller than the absorption depth in the 2003 july observation ( see figure  4 ) . in the context of the scattering hypothesis",
    ", this suggests that there should be a considerable amount of scattered light in the absorption trough , yet we did not detect any change in polarization across the absorption trough .",
    "similar arguments apply to the resonance scattering scenario .",
    "the only scattering scenario that remains viable is one in which the scattering medium surrounds the distant , intrinsic absorber ( as depicted in figure  1c ) . in this scenario",
    "the scattering angle is small and so is the resulting degree of polarization .",
    "the observed coverage fraction sets an additional constraint on this scenario : the combination of scattering optical depth and solid angle in the scattering medium around the absorber must be such so it can redirect the appropriate number of photons towards the observer .",
