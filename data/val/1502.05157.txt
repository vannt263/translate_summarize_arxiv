    "these spectra were fitted with an isothermal and a power - law non - thermal thick - target model @xcite . in the rise phase of the flare we used a second thermal component in order to achieve an acceptable goodness of the fit ( figure  [ f3]c ) .",
    "the non - thermal electron distribution is steep during the entire flare .",
    "the hardest spectrum occurred during the flare peak with an electron distribution index @xmath13 ( figure  [ f3]d ) .",

    "we compare the non - thermal energy estimate to the free magnetic energy stored in the ar . assuming a force - free pre- and post - flare corona , we approximate the local corona of noaa  2192 by a nlff field .",
    "the magnetic energy of the nlff field in excess over that of a corresponding potential field , gives an upper limit for the energy available for release during a flare .",

    "this is in agreement with the high magnetic energies generally found for ars hosting major flares .",
    "given the estimated non - thermal flare energy , roughly 10% of the excess energy was carried away by accelerated electrons . at the same time , however , magnetic energy was again stored and resulted in a similar amount of excess energy after the flare , allowing for equally intense energy releases during the following major events .",

    "longest flare emission , lasting up to @xmath21  min , concentrated in five clusters ( labeled as @xmath22@xmath20 ) .",
    "these locations nicely line up with the non - thermal _ rhessi _ sources ( cyan contours in figure  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "importantly , @xmath22@xmath20 were associated to locations of recurrent brightenings , i.  e. , the re - energization of flare pixels ( plus signs in figure  [ f5]a ) .",
    "we interpret peaks detected in the 1600    light curves as representing re - brightening whenever these peaks were separated in time by more than 7  min ( to allow for cooling effects ) and if more than one peak occurred at the same location during the impulsive phase ( between 14:02  ut and 14:28  ut ) . in figure",

    "inspection of the light curves reveals that the first intensity peak occurred in the early impulsive phase ( before @xmath2314:10  ut ) , followed by another ( sometimes even more pronounced ) peak after @xmath2314:20  ut .",
    "note that these periods of re - brightening are tightly associated to the two episodes of hxr bursts ( figure  [ f3]a ) .",
    "these findings evidence that magnetic field structures originating from a same narrow region ( within the aia resolution of @xmath91@xmath242 ) were involved in multiple magnetic reconnection events .",
    "noaa  2192 showed an exceptional flaring behavior .",
    "in particular , it produced a series of six confined x - class flares in a period of nine days without associated cmes .",
    "so far , only @xcite reported five confined x - flares that originated from a single ar ( in the course of two days ) . using global magnetic field modeling",
    ", we find the cause of confinement in the form of a roughly north - south oriented arcade of strong magnetic field , serving as a top and lateral confinement to the flaring in the ar core .",
    "this is also supported by the more remote location of an eruptive m - class flare , which occurred close to the open field that neighbored the strong and closed core field .",
    "the flare ribbons observed during the confined major ( m5.0 and larger ) flares on oct  2224 exhibited a period of fast growth in extent but no considerable separation .",
    "this phenomenon was reported so far only for flares @xmath14m5.0 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the separation of the flare ribbons was large ( @xmath950  mm ) already at the flares onsets , which suggests a reconnection site high in the corona .",
    "the associated sxr light curves classify the confined flares as long - duration events , objecting their suggested higher impulsiveness compared to eruptive events ( e.  g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed analysis of the confined x1.6 flare on oct  22 showed that the non - thermal electron distribution was very steep during the entire flare and that the total energy in electrons ( @xmath25  j ) was , for an x1-flare , unusually high ( compare * ? ? ? * ) . in accordance to previous studies , this pictures such events as efficient particle accelerators confined to the low corona ( e.  g. , *",
    ". that also implies , however , that only a small fraction was accelerated to high energies , out of the large number of particles accelerated at the reconnection site .",
    "comparison of the non - thermal flare energy and the magnetic excess energy in the ar shows that about 10% of it was carried away by flare - accelerated electrons . finally , we find re - brightening in flare pixels , providing evidence for the same magnetic field structures being repeatedly involved in magnetic reconnection .",
