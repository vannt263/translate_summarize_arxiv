    "be stars are defined observationally as non - supergiant b stars that have , or have had in the past , emission detected in the balmer series of hydrogen , most notably in h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the emission is thought to arise from a thin , equatorial disk of gas surrounding the central star @xcite .",
    "this picture is consistent with many other properties of be stars , such as an excess of infrared radiation @xcite , linear continuum polarization @xcite , and interferometric observations that directly resolve the disks @xcite .    in the milky way",
    "about 17% of all non - supergiant b stars are be stars , although the fraction varies widely with spectral type , reaching a maximum of @xmath1% at b1 @xcite .",
    "why some b stars , and not others , become be stars is currently unclear .",
    "rapid rotation of the central b star seems to play a key role @xcite , but details are still lacking as a definitive determination of the actual rotation rates of the central stars is complicated by the potential effects of gravitational darkening @xcite .    also unclear is the exact mechanism(s ) that creates be star disks .",
    "keplerian rotation , now established for be star disks @xcite , suggests viscous disks as the correct physical model @xcite , but how material is feed into the inner edge of the disk is unknown @xcite .",
    "it is possible pulsation plays a critical role @xcite , and there is tantalizing observation evidence supporting this view @xcite .",
    "the role of binarity in the be phenomena is unclear @xcite , although the majority of be stars do not seem to be the result of binary evolution @xcite . in this current work ,",
    "we consider only single , isolated be stars .",
    "key to understanding the factors that produce the be phenomenon are cluster studies which allow ages to be assigned to the individual be stars .",
    "then any trends with evolutionary status can be examined .",
    "there have been claims either that the be phenomenon occurs primarily in the later half of the main sequence @xcite or throughout the entire main sequence @xcite .",
    "other studies find be stars both in very young clusters , @xmath2myr , and an enhancement in older clusters , @xmath3myr @xcite , suggesting two effects at work : some be stars are born as rapid rotators while others become rapid rotators during main sequence evolution due to the internal redistribution of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "be stars are also detectable in open clusters in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) , and this allows investigation of the role of metallicity in the be phenomena .",
    "the solar metallicity is @xmath4 while the metallicity of the lmc is about @xmath5 and the smc , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the trend of the fraction of be stars in a cluster with metallicity seems clear from many studies : the fraction of be stars tends to rise with decreasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "such a trend may have a natural explanation in the dependence of mass - loss due to stellar winds on the metallicity @xcite ; a lower metallicity results in weaker stellar winds and hence stars in low - metallicity environments rotate more quickly , a fact well established for the smc @xcite .",
    "thus the more quickly rotating b star population leads to a higher fraction of be stars .",
    "nevertheless , all of these comparative studies between the mw , lmc , and smc proceed by counting candidate be stars in the total cluster population , selected either photometrically or spectroscopically with very low - resolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "of course not all be stars in a population can be found this way and detection efficiencies generally point to selection criteria of a h@xmath0 emission equivalent width in excess of @xmath7  as required to identify a candidate be star @xcite .",
    "assumed in all of these studies is that individual be stars are more or less the same in the mw , lmc , and smc so that the comparative statistics are not affected by the detection efficiency .",
    "however , there are indications that , at some level , this may not be true . for example",
    ", the equivalent width distribution of h@xmath0 differs between the mw and smc , with the smc distribution peaking at higher equivalent widths @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will illustrate a fundamental difference between be star disks in the mw and the smc : for the same central star spectral type and disk density distribution , disks in the smc are much hotter than in the mw .",
    "we will quantify this effect over the early be star spectral types ( those for which lmc and smc samples are reasonably complete ) , and we will examine how counts of the be star populations based on the h@xmath0 equivalent width in different metallicity systems might be affected by this systematic temperature difference .",
    "the thermal structure of the be star disks was computed with the bedisk code of @xcite .",
    "this code enforces radiative equilibrium in a photoionized circumstellar disk including the heating and cooling processes for the 9 most abundant elements ( h , he , cno , mg , si , ca , & fe ) over several ionization stages . details of the atomic models and atomic data , as well as an overview of the bedisk code , are given in @xcite .",
    "the density structure of the disk was assumed to be of the fixed form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the cylindrical co - ordinates for the assumed axisymmetric disk , and @xmath11 is the radius of the central b star .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are adjustable parameters that fix the density structure of the disk .",
    "the function @xmath14 , defined below by eq .",
    "[ eq : scale_height ] , sets the vertical ( or @xmath10 ) scale height of the disk .",
    "this simple density model has been very successful in interpreting a wide range of be star observations @xcite .",
    "thus the thermal models of this work are identified first by the spectral type of the central b star ( which sets the photoionizing radiation field ) and then by the disk density parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "the fundamental parameters assumed for the central b stars are given in table  [ tab : bstars ] .",
    "the mass and radius as a function of spectral type , as well as the mw @xmath15 calibration , are adopted from @xcite .",
    "note that we have assumed the same mass and radius as a function of spectral type for the mw and smc .",
    "stellar evolution calculations have shown that b stars are likely smaller in low metallicity systems such as the smc .",
    "for example , @xcite show that a @xmath16 star ( roughly a b0 star ) decreases in radius by about 20% as the metallicity is lowered from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "however , we have ignored these differences to ensure both the smc and mw disk models have the same density structure . the spectral - type  @xmath15 calibration for the smc is discussed below .    the vertical ( or @xmath10 ) dependence of eq .",

    "hence , the small mismatch between the overall @xmath33\\approx -1.0 $ ] abundances used to compute the photoionizing radiation by @xcite and actual smc abundances used here is likely of little consequence to the results .",

    "the milky way calibration of b dwarfs by @xcite agrees well with the @xmath15 scale of @xcite ( adopted in this work ) whereas the lmc and smc calibrations are systematically hotter by a few thousand degrees .",

    "one caveat to our analysis is that we have ignored gravitational darkening of the central b stars due to rotation . as a class ,",
    "be stars are well established to be rapid rotators @xcite , although how close to critical rotation ( in which the equatorial velocity of the star equals the orbital speed ) is still contentious .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that rotation rates above 80% of critical rotation ( or @xmath34 ) may be difficult to detect because gravitational darkening leads to a significant cooling of the star s most rapidly rotating equatorial regions .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite used a statistical analysis _ including the effects of gravitational darkening _ to demonstrate that the distribution of rotation speeds for early be stars ( in the mw ) is fairly uniform between 60 and 100% of critical .",
    "hence for the mw , a representative value of 80% , or @xmath35 , is reasonable .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that for the smc field ngc  330 , be stars rotate on average at @xmath36 .",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that be star disks become systematically cooler as a result of gravitational darkening .",

    "we also show that the h@xmath0 equivalent width distributions of our models is in reasonable agreement with the known mw distribution .",
    "however , a similar distribution of underlying parameters does not seem to fit the smc .",
    "we confirm the suggestion of @xcite that systematically larger be stars disks in the smc may explain this discrepancy .",
    "it would be desirable to put this interesting result on a sounder footing by directly determining the disk parameters for a sample of smc be star disks via the analysis of high - resolution spectra .",
    "such a study would directly give the distribution of disk parameters ( @xmath13 , @xmath12 and @xmath65 ) which could be compared to a similar sample in the mw and would allow a more detailed investigation of how lower metallicity affects these circumstellar disks",
