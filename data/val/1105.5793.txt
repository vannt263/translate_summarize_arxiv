    "surface plasmon - polariton  ( spp ) waves are surface waves guided by a planar interface of a metal and a dielectric material .",

    "if a periodic nonhomogeneity normal to the wave - guiding interface is introduced in the dielectric partnering material , multiple spp waves with different polarization states , phase speeds , and spatial profiles can be guided by the metal - dielectric interface .",
    "this has recently been shown both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in all of these studies ,",
    "the dielectric partnering material is also locally orthorhombic .",
    "very recently , we have solved a canonical boundary - value problem  @xcite to show that multiple spp waves can be guided even if the dielectric partnering material is isotropic  provided that material is also periodically nonhomogeneous normal to the interface .",
    "this is a very attractive result , because both partnering materials are isotropic and because the dielectric partnering material can be fabricated as a rugate filter @xcite .",
    "the canonical boundary - value problem does not possess direct practical significance , because both partnering materials are assumed to be semi - infinite normal to the planar interface .",
    "therefore , we set out to investigate the excitation of multiple spp waves by the periodically corrugated interface of a metal and a rugate filter .",
    "this grating - coupled configuration @xcite is popular , when the dielectric partnering material is homogeneous , because it allows the excitation of an spp wave by a nonspecular floquet harmonic .",
    "the interplay of the periodic nonhomogeneity of the dielectric partnering material and a periodically corrugated interface is phenomenologically rich @xcite , and should lead to the excitation of multiple spp waves as different floquet harmonics .",
    "the relevant boundary - value problem was formulated using the rigorous coupled - wave analysis  ( rcwa )  @xcite . in this numerical technique ,",
    "the constitutive parameters are expanded in terms of fourier series with known expansion coefficients , and the electromagnetic field phasors are expanded in terms of floquet harmonics whose coefficients are determined by substitution in the frequency - domain maxwell curl postulates .",
    "the accuracy of solution is conventionally held to depend only on the number of floquet harmonics actually used in the computations  @xcite .",

    "<S> the excitation of multiple surface - plasmon - polariton  ( spp ) waves of different linear polarization states and phase speeds by a surface - relief grating formed by a metal and a rugate filter , both of finite thickness , was studied theoretically , using rigorous coupled - wave - analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the incident plane wave can be either @xmath0 or @xmath1 polarized . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation of spp waves is indicated by the presence of those peaks in the plots of absorbance vs. the incidence angle that are independent of the thickness of the rugate filter . </S>",
    "<S> the absorbance peaks representing the excitation of @xmath1-polarized spp waves are narrower than those representing @xmath0-polarized spp waves . </S>",
    "<S> two incident plane waves propagating in different directions may excite the same spp wave . </S>",
    "<S> a line source could excite several spp waves simultaneously . </S>"
