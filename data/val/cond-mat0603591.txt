    ", more detailed knowledge is becoming available , since new experimental methods allow mapping of the charge distribution inside such dots and even the details of the individual electron wavefunctions can be resolved @xcite .",
    "the most accurate electron wave functions are provided by 3d poisson - schrdinger simulations @xcite .",
    "these methods are highly developed but are computer intensive and therefore not well suited for systematic studies over a wide range of parameter values @xcite .",
    "furthermore , numerical results are seldom conducive to developing intuition about the importance of specific parameters . in parallel with these 3d approaches , a number of simpler two dimensional ( 2d ) models",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "one of their key assumptions is strict confinement of the electron gas to a plane ( 2deg ) , and often the transverse confining potential in that plane is taken arbitrarily to be a parabola or other simple analytic shape .",
    "energy density functionals have been used to further simplify the computations while still including the main terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "free parameters available in such models can be adjusted to fit the data from the experiment being analyzed .",
    "the advantage of 2d models is that they require much less numerical effort , simplify the interpretation of results and allow systematic analysis . on the other hand , empirical parameters of these models",
    "may conceal or distort some aspects of the physics at play .",
    "our primary objective is to connect these two approaches in a detailed and quantitative manner .",
    "to do so with good accuracy and a reasonable amount of computation , we restrict our attention to axially symmetric dots , which has the advantage of reducing the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the specific heterostructure layout that will be studied .",
    "we construct the total potential acting on the electrons , including the coulomb interaction ( direct and mirror terms ) , and the electrostatic confining potential due to the gates and donors .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is solved numerically in the 3d hartree approximation . by varying the gate voltage we present results for dots of different sizes .",
    "our first step towards simpler models with a more transparent interpretation is the factorization _ ansatz _ between longitudinal and transverse components of the electron wavefunctions .",
    "this describes the dot in an effective 2d hartree approximation .",
    "we end this section by showing that the predictions of this _ ansatz _ are in very good agreement with the full 3d hartree calculations .",
    "section iii is devoted to the construction of effective confining potentials and coulomb interactions for use in 2d models , which incorporate finite thickness effects .",
    "we show in particular that there is a substantial difference at short distances between the effective coulomb interaction and the @xmath1 law . in section",
    "iv we define an energy density functional based on the thomas - fermi ( t - f ) approximation for the kinetic energy and , via a variational prescription , find equations to determine the corresponding electron density , along with the coulomb , confinement and kinetic energies .    in section v ,",
    "we show how to improve on the semi - classical model of shikin _ et al .",
    "we do so by taking into account the semiclassical kinetic energy , the mirror coulomb terms and the role of finite thickness of the 2deg on the coulomb interaction .",
    "we replace the thomas - fermi densities in the variational equations by the simple parametrization first introduced by shikin _",
    "_ @xcite and later extended by ye and zaremba @xcite .",
    "we show that after these simplifications , the numerical effort is reduced to a minimum : solving a very simple nonlinear equation for the dot radius @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting predictions for bulk properties such as the number of electrons , root mean square radius , kinetic , confining and coulomb energies are quantitatively accurate . finally , by restricting the parametrized density to the simplest shikin form , but keeping all relevant potential contributions , we show that the dot size systematics can be obtained from an analytic expression where each term has a clear interpretation and expresses the physics quantitatively .",
    "fig . [ figl01 ] shows a section of the heterojunction that we will use for reference .",
    "it consists of planar layers grown on a gaas substrate which we model as infinitely thick and free of acceptors . from bottom to top there are 1 ) an algaas spacer layer of thickness @xmath3 , 2 ) an algaas donor layer of thickness @xmath4 , uniformly doped with donor concentration @xmath5 , 3 ) a gaas cap layer , undoped and of thickness @xmath6 .",
    "the cap layer is covered by a metallic gate except for a circular opening of radius @xmath7 exposing the gaas cap layer .",
    "since our main purpose is to compare the predictions of several models , rather than to produce an accurate description of a specific experiment , we introduce several simplifying assumptions that will make our calculations less cumbersome , but which should not affect the physics to be explored .",
    "the first of these is the gate geometry just described . using expressions to be given below ,",
    "we have checked that for rings of a few hundred nanometers width , and same inner radius @xmath7 , the potential due to the gates is practically identical to that of the simplified gate used here , at the location of the dot .",
    "also for simplicity we neglect the differences in dielectric constant @xmath8 between the different materials , and use a common energy - independent effective mass for spacer and substrate .    since in an earlier work @xcite we modelled quantum wires using similar microsopic models we have adopted the same geometrical and physical parameters for the heterostructure : @xmath9 nm , @xmath10 nm , @xmath11 nm , and @xmath12 nm@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 . these values are taken from a model heterostructure considered by laux",
