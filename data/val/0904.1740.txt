    "at a first glance , searching for quasars behind the disk of the galaxy or the magellanic clouds seems neither useful nor promising .",
    "while this presently holds for the problem of finding such quasars , they are useful tools once discovered .",
    "in particular , they serve as astrometric references for proper motion studies and the ( ultraviolet ) bright quasars can be used to study absorption in the interstellar medium",
    ". they may also be unique tools for studying the variability of quasars .",
    "after outlining the uses of such quasars and the results of existing searches for them , we present a simple , robust procedure to identify quasars in dense stellar fields with moderate extinction and generate a high purity catalog of quasar candidates in the magellanic clouds .",
    "our understanding of the dynamics of the galaxy and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) relies profoundly on our ability to measure the proper motions of stars , and a key use of quasars in dense stellar fields is as astrometric references .",
    "after early efforts using ground based imaging in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the galactic bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) , most recent studies have used the higher astrometric precision of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "this has led to considerable recent progress on the proper motions of stars in the lmc ( @xcite ) , smc ( @xcite ) and the galactic bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies are limited by the small numbers of available quasars , with less than 100 known for the lmc ( e.g. , ) and only a few dozen candidates behind the galactic bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    a second use for these quasars is for absorption line studies of the interstellar medium of the galaxy and the clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the clouds this has largely been limited to studies of the magellanic stream ( e.g. , ) rather than the clouds themselves . while there are no guarantees that sufficiently bright quasars exist behind the clouds , the advent of the cosmic origins spectrograph for _ hst _ will allow the use of significantly fainter quasars than earlier studies .",
    "the third , and least obvious , use of these quasars is as the best existing data base for understanding quasar variability . because of the microlensing studies of the magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge ( eros  ; macho ",
    "@xcite ; moa ",
    "@xcite ; ogle ",
    "@xcite ) , most quasars identified in these regions will have well - sampled , decade long light curves that can be used to study the optical variability of quasars . the ensemble variability of quasars is well studied ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but less is known about the variability properties of individual quasars because it has been difficult to monitor them in large numbers . while some newer projects will remedy this problem ( e.g. , quest , ringstorf et al . 2009",
    "; pan - starrs , lsst ) , these data already exist for quasars in the microlensing regions and , to a lesser extent , for stripe 82 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite , recently found that quasar light curves have characteristic time scales that are well - correlated with their black hole mass ( estimated from their emission line widths ) , but poorly correlated with their accretion rate ( relative to eddington ) . a significant fraction of the quasars suitable for the analysis were the @xcite variability - selected quasars in the lmc .",
    "most quasars are identified by distinguishing their optical colors from those of stars , with the sdss samples representing the largest color - selected samples to date ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in dense stellar fields , however ,",
    "the enormously increased surface density of stars and stellar remnants make this approach increasingly problematic .",
    "thus , searches in the clouds and the galactic bulge , mainly driven by the search for astrometric references , have focused on examining x - ray sources ( ) , radio sources ( e.g. , ) , or time variability ( ) . the largest samples come from the time variability searches , but even samples of aperiodic objects with long term variability turn out to be dominated ( 80% ) by stars rather than quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies have shown that mid - ir color selection is an extremely efficient means of finding luminous quasars ( @xcite ) , although the method works poorly for low luminosity agns whose mid - ir emission is dominated by the host galaxy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are good reasons to expect this approach to work well even in crowded stellar fields with significant visual extinction .",
    "normal stars have mid - ir ( vega ) colors near zero , well away from the region of color space occupied by quasars ",
    "only the much rarer stars with significant emission from dust can begin to mimic the colors of quasars and many of these will have optical to mid - ir colors or apparent magnitudes that are inconsistent with those of quasars . the principal , potential contaminants ( see blum et al .",
    "2006 ) , are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , and young stellar objects ( yso ) .    in section  2",
    "we combine results from studies of the extragalactic noao deep wide field survey ( @xcite ) botes field based on the irac shallow survey ( @xcite ) , the _ spitzer",
    "_ deep wide field survey ( sdwfs , @xcite ) and the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , c. s. kochanek et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) with the _ spitzer _ sage survey data ( @xcite ) and ogle - iii optical survey ( @xcite ) of the lmc to develop a simple method of selecting agn in these dense stellar fields .",
    "we use this method to produce a catalog of 4699 , and 657 quasar candidates in the lmc and smc based on the sage ( @xcite ) and s3mc ( @xcite ) surveys . in practice",
    ", our basic result is very simple  the sources that @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite systematically refer to as galaxies or star forming galaxies are mostly relatively high ( @xmath2 ) redshift quasars .",
    "our basic approach is explained by figures  [ fig : bootes ] and [ fig : sage ] where we show mid - ir color - color and color - magnitude distributions for both the sdwfs extragalactic field and the sage lmc field . for the sdwfs field",
    "we show all sources , while for the lmc we use the sage point source catalog containing @xmath3 objects . in both cases",
    "we include only objects with magnitudes measured in all four irac bands ( [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] ) , leaving us with 44,022 sdwfs and 220,158 sage sources .",
    "the sdwfs covers approximately 9  sq .",
    "deg . , while sage covers approximately 49 deg@xmath4 .",
    "we start with the stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) mid - ir color selection criterion ( a.k.a . the agn wedge ) based on the @xmath5-[8.0]$ ] and @xmath6-[4.5]$ ] colors .",
    "the agn wedge is known to be very efficient at separating luminous agn from other extragalactic sources and normal stars .",
    "_ cut 1 . _",
    "as we compare the color - color diagrams for the ndwfs and sage fields , we see that for the lmc there is a plume of stars rising from the stellar peak ( at vega colors of zero ) along the blue @xmath7-[8.0]$ ] edge of the agn wedge .",
    "the plume lies along the color sequence for 500 - 1000  k black bodies . for our first cut",
    ", we divide this color space into three regions .",
    "class c consists of all objects outside the agn wedge .",
    "we divide the wedge into class a and b regions using the black body color sequence shifted by @xmath8  mag in @xmath6-[4.5]$ ] color .",
    "the bluer class b objects are roughly consistent with black bodies , while the redder class a objects are not . in botes ,",
    "90% of agn wedge sources are class a ( 6,599 versus 608 ) .",
    "if we now examine where the class a and b objects lie in the @xmath6-[8.0]$ ] versus @xmath9 $ ] color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , we see that the class b objects lie either on the agb sequence or are generally mixed with the class a objects . fortunately , there is a large flux difference between the brightest quasars and galactic or magellanic cloud agb stars , which leads to our second cut .",
    "_ our second cut is based on the @xmath6-[8.0]$ ] versus @xmath9 $ ] cmd . we know from cut 1 that we must include a criterion on the apparent magnitude to eliminate agb stars .",
    "moreover , if the dust emission from a star is characterized by a range of dust temperatures , then the star can lie in region a. in particular , the sage ( whitney et al . 2008 ) criteria for candidate ysos overlap region a but select apparent magnitudes brighter than the typical agn .",
    "thus , we divide the cmd into three regions .",
    "we define the yso region as @xmath10-[8.0]<4.5 $ ] and @xmath11 < 13.5 $ ] based on whitney et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and the fainter qso region by @xmath12-[8.0 ] < 4.5 $ ] and @xmath6 > 13.5 $ ] .",
    "the remaining space is defined as `` other '' . from the botes field",
    "we see that the vast majority of the quasars lie in the qso region ( 6131 versus 11 ) , but the bright quasars that are the best candidates for absorption line studies lie in the yso region . also , the yso sample from whitney et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is biased toward brighter ysos and we expect some contamination from fainter ysos in our qso region . while in botes we would lose 15% of candidates due to the @xmath6-[8.0]$ ] color limit , this is not a factor in the brighter sage sample . note that these cuts will work well for the clouds and the galaxy , with the balance of the yso region shifting in favor of quasars for galactic fields , but they would need to be significantly modified for a more distant field ( e.g. , m33 ) because the agb sequence would shift into the qso region .",
    "_ cut 3 . _",
    "the ogle - iii survey covers roughly half of the sage survey area .",
    "we matched the sage sources with the ogle - iii optical photometry for their region of overlap , and in figure  [ fig : optical - ir ] we examine the @xmath13$]/@xmath6-[8.0]$ ] color - color distribution of the botes quasars as compared to our qso - a , qso - b , yso - a and yso - b sources as well as the `` high probability '' yso candidates from whitney et al .",
    "we divide this color space into region `` a '' containing the botes quasars and region `` b '' outside of it . applying this cut",
    "excludes a reasonable fraction of ysos at the potential price of missing very high redshift ( @xmath14 ) or obscured quasars .",
    "a quasar candidate is any object other than class c objects from cut 1 and `` other '' objects from cut 2 . for the botes quasars , 6,599/608 are class a / b , 6,131/11 are qso / yso , and 5,961/181 are class a / b .",
    "stellar contamination will be higher for class b , yso and b than for class a , qso and a. of the 722 whitney et al .",

    "we have not worried about extinction here , as it is generally too low to significantly affect our mid - ir selection criterion , but statistical use of these samples will have to consider the effects of extinction on the optical , spectroscopic limits , probably based on hi maps such as @xcite or rr lyrae ( @xcite ) .    the purity of the catalogs will depend on the selection regions . scaling the numbers of candidates in the botes field to the area and flux limits of the sage survey",

    "taken at face value , the qso sample purities compared to an extragalactic field are 95% , 3% , 20% and 0% respectively with the contamination in the qso - a , yso - a and yso - b classes dominated by ysos and that of the qso - b class dominated by an unidentified population .",
    "adding cut # 3 leads to the loss of 2% , 1% , 19% and 35% of the candidates in these groups ( 50% , 32% , 64% and 79% of the @xcite yso candidates ) , substantially increasing the expected purities .",

    "fortunately , this region of color space contains only 10% of botes candidates .",
    "we have not addressed contamination by other extragalactic sources , as we know from our use of this approach in the botes field of the ndwfs ( stern et al .",

    "moreover , the survey is largely confined to regions of very high visual extinction where spectroscopic confirmation is infeasible .",
    "note , however , that the problem of stellar contamination diminishes in the galactic plane relative to the clouds because the dusty stars are shifted to lower apparent magnitudes , moving them away from the quasars . in lower stellar density fields , like those of dwarf spheroidals ; it would be straightforward to use variants of our approach based on only the @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] bands to efficiently identify background quasars with warm _",
    "spitzer_.    follow - up spectroscopy with aaomega on the anglo - australian telescope ( e.g. , @xcite ) could efficiently confirm the candidates , since its large field of view and fiber number are well - matched to the source density . with an expansion in the number of extragalactic reference sources by well over an order of magnitude",
    ", future improvements in the proper motions of the clouds will be limited by the time needed to make the proper motion measurements rather than by the availability of reference sources .",
    "finding quasars for absorption line studies will require working in the higher contamination yso region of our selection method .",
    "perhaps most importantly , these are the most intensively monitored quasars we presently have .",
    "many will have well - sampled light curves extending for over a decade , allowing large statistical studies of the variability properties of individual quasars rather than ensembles of quasars .",
    "spectroscopy serves not only to determine the redshift but also to supply an estimate of the quasar black hole masses based on their emission line widths ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with large samples",
    "it will quickly become clear if the tantalizing correlations between variability properties and intrinsic properties noted by @xcite hold generally .",
