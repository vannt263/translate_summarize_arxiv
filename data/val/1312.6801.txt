    "neutron - rich @xmath2 hypernuclei were discussed by theorists numerously ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . some data on @xmath4he and @xmath5he have been obtained from the old emulsion experiments @xcite .",
    "a new stage of study of neutron - rich hypernuclei was opened by the kek experiment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1li hypernucleus was produced by the @xmath6 reaction . because of poor statistics , it was impossible to measure the binding energy of @xmath1li , but the production cross section has been determined .",
    "later , few events interpreted as production of @xmath7h were reported by the finuda collaboration @xcite .",
    "they studied the @xmath8 reaction at rest and detected pions from weak decay of the final hypernucleus .",
    "hypernucleus @xmath4he was observed also by the @xmath9 reaction @xcite .",
    "in addition , several experiments @xcite are known , which established only upper bounds for production probabilities .",
    "production of neutron - rich @xmath2 hypernuclei remains to be a difficult task not only because typical cross sections are small .",
    "the production dynamics is poorly understood too , and theoretical predictions for production probabilities are problematic .",
    "the most evident mechanism of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 reactions is the two - step one with meson charge exchange , for instance , @xmath12 followed by @xmath13 .",
    "another mechanism was considered in @xcite , namely , one - step process @xmath14 .",
    "a small @xmath0 admixture in a @xmath2 hypernucleus appears from the @xmath15 interaction and serves as a doorway state .",
    "the production amplitudes are small due to two - step nature of the first mechanism and smallness of the @xmath0 admixture providing the second mechanism .",
    "this is not obvious which mechanism is more productive .",
    "note also that the third mechanism , production via @xmath16 admixture in the initial nucleus @xcite , remains unexplored .    at first",
    ", it was suggested that the two - step mechanism is dominant for the @xmath10 process , and the two - step cross section for the @xmath3 reaction was estimated @xcite .",
    "experiment @xcite gave substantially ( by several times ) lower cross sections .",
    "this is not surprising in view of many poorly known input parameters involved in the calculation .",
    "more important , the experiment showed that the production cross section is higher at incident pion momentum @xmath17 gev / c than at @xmath18 gev / c while the theory predicted the opposite @xmath19 dependence .",
    "thus the measured cross sections seem to be incompatible with the assumption of the two - step process dominance .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that , otherwise , the one - step process is prevailing . using the distorted wave impulse approximation and the green function method for the reaction amplitude",
    ", they succeeded to reproduce the observed @xmath19 dependence of the cross section .",
    "its absolute value agrees with the experiment if probability of @xmath0 admixture @xmath20 is as large as @xmath21% @xcite .",
    "probability @xmath20 is the key quantity in this problem .",
    "we do not discuss here a long history of @xmath22 admixture studies concerning various topics for various @xmath2 hypernuclei , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "as for specific @xmath1li , the @xmath23 mixing has been treated in the framework of the shell model @xcite .",
    "we apply here another approach which is free from some restrictions inherent in the previous studies .    in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , we introduce our model and compare it with other approaches .",
    "details of the calculation and results are presented in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , we discuss implications of our results and give some concluding remarks .",
    "considering the @xmath23 coupling in @xmath2 hypernuclei , one comes to hamiltonian @xmath24 here @xmath25 contains a @xmath2-nucleus potential , which is , strictly speaking , different from a phenomenological potential used in a single - channel picture .",
    "the latter one involves already a contribution arising from the @xmath23 coupling .",
    "the @xmath22-nucleus potential in @xmath26 is usually assumed to be the same as its real part for a real @xmath22 hyperon , though a @xmath22 hyperon in @xmath2 hypernuclei is substantially virtual .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath22-nucleus potential , describing the @xmath27 conversion of a real @xmath22 hyperon , is irrelevant to this problem .",
    "but the @xmath23 interaction determines nondiagonal term @xmath28 .    in the shell model",
    "approaches @xcite , configurations with @xmath2 and @xmath22 hyperons are treated at the same footing .",
    "this means that eigenstates of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are mixed by nondiagonal interaction @xmath28 just like various configurations in the @xmath2 sector are mixed by a residual interaction .",
    "the shell model is famous in nuclear and hypernuclear physics and has been applied successfully to spectra of @xmath29 shell @xmath2 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "however , being extended to the @xmath22 sector , this approach encounters some problems .",
    "since @xmath30 is about 80 mev , all eigenvalues of @xmath26 lie rather highly and far from energies of the corresponding @xmath2 hypernucleus .",
    "therefore , differences between eigenenergies of @xmath26 and the actual hypernuclear energy ( denominators in a perturbative expansion ) have comparable values for many @xmath26 eigenstates including continuum ones .",
    "thus , it is difficult to truncate properly the perturbative expansion in the @xmath26 eigenstates .",
    "moreover , usually only bound eigenstates are taken into account in the shell model .",
    "even if the @xmath22-nucleus potential is attractive , only the @xmath31 hyperon state is typically bound in light hypernuclei spectrum for @xmath0 contains also the multitude of coulombic bound states . however , being rather spatially extended , coulombic states unlikely give a sizable contribution to the expansion at least in light systems . ] .",
    "so all other ( continuum ) eigenstates lying not so far from the bound state are simply dropped . strictly following these lines",
    ", one may conclude that the mixing is completely impossible for a repulsive ( or even slightly attractive ) @xmath22-nucleus potential , which is evidently wrong .",
    "note that after the kek experiment @xcite , interaction of a @xmath0 hyperon with a neutron - rich nucleus is believed to be repulsive .",
    "we apply here another approach .",
    "the model is rather simple , but does not include explicitly any expansion in eigenstates of @xmath26 , which seems to be an inappropriate basis in this problem .",
    "therefore , we deal with repulsive and attractive @xmath22-nucleus potentials with equal ease .",
    "first , let us write down the @xmath1li wave function as @xmath32 we consider only the ground state doublet of @xmath1li , i.e. , the @xmath2 hyperon in the @xmath33 state moving in the field of @xmath34li(gs ) . since spin and parity of @xmath34li(gs ) are @xmath35 , the lowest levels of @xmath1li are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we restrict our consideration to an @xmath38 state of @xmath0 hyperon and a @xmath35 state of @xmath34be .",
    "since one neutron is involved in the @xmath39 transition , we use the technique of coefficients of fractional parentage : @xmath40 we take into account three lowest states of @xmath41li : 2@xmath42 ( gs ) , 1@xmath42 ( 0.98 mev ) , and 3@xmath42 ( 2.26 mev ) .",
    "applying hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) to wave function ( [ e2 ] ) , one gets a system of @xmath43 coupled equations .",
    "however , two - particle interaction @xmath28 does not mix different states of @xmath41li , which is an inert core in this problem .",
    "therefore , the system separates to @xmath44 independent pairs of equations . for the @xmath45th component",
    ", we have @xmath46 here @xmath47 .",
    "we stress that we do not try to solve the general problem of the @xmath23 coupling in @xmath1li , including , for instance , corresponding energy shifts .",
    "our goal is only to find the specific @xmath0 component , which is of vital importance for the production reactions .",
    "that is why we do not insert explicitly other @xmath22 channels ( as well as many various channels in the @xmath2 sector , which may be comparable in probabilities with @xmath22 channels ) to the equations .",
    "it is inferred that all other channels are included effectively into @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 should contain just a phenomenological @xmath2-nucleus potential in this approach .",
    "the single @xmath0 channel treated explicitly is small and can not modify the @xmath2-nucleus interaction significantly .",
    "since the @xmath0 admixture is small , it can not also modify meaningfully the wave function in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "therefore , we may treat system ( [ e4 ] ) perturbatively .",
    "first , @xmath48 is found from the first equation without the coupling term .",
    "then , the second equation is solved for @xmath49 . for radial wave function @xmath50",
    ", the equation is as follows : @xmath51 where source term @xmath52 arises from the matrix element of the @xmath53 transition .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 admixture wave function is @xmath54 and the probability @xmath55    the resulting wave function can not be recognized as the @xmath31 one since it does not correspond to any eigenstate of @xmath26 . in terms of these eigenstates",
    ", it is generally a superposition of bound and continuum @xmath38 eigenstates .",
    "the @xmath35 state of @xmath34be in ( [ e2 ] ) is also not the ground state of @xmath34be , but a superposition of different @xmath56 states .",
    "coefficients of fractional parentage @xmath57 are determined by the coefficients of expansion ( [ e3 ] ) and the coupling .",
    "it should be noted here that we neglect @xmath34be states with other spins and parities , which is a restriction of the model .",
    "the @xmath15 interaction is chosen as a central spin - dependent potential @xmath58 it is seen from @xcite that the tensor coupling interaction plays typically a minor role in @xmath29 shell @xmath2 hypernuclei so we neglect the tensor potential in ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "the approach described above is similar to that used in @xcite for @xmath59be and @xmath60c .",
    "however , only one term in ( [ e3 ] ) corresponding to the ground state of the inert core was taken into account in that paper .",
    "the most important input in our calculation is , of course , coupling potential @xmath28 .",
    "empirical knowledge of this interaction is nearly absent , and various theoretical models give rather different predictions .",
    "we do not make here any selection of known potentials .",
    "instead , we examine interactions available in the literature and try to establish limits , in which the true results may be confined .",
    "we use the effective interactions of the so - called yng type ( quoted in @xcite ) derived by yamamoto from the old nijmegen models : model d with a hard core ( nhcd ) @xcite and the early soft - core model ( nsc89 ) @xcite as well as much more recent interactions esc08a , esc08a@xmath61 , and esc08b ( nijmegen extended soft - core models ) @xcite .",
    "we ignore the tensor parts of the esc interactions .",
    "all these potentials were obtained as effective interactions by the brueckner @xmath62 matrix calculation ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "we use also potential d2 from @xcite .",
    "another input is coefficients of fractional parentage @xmath63 .",
    "we consider the corresponding spectroscopic factors extracted from experiments and calculated theoretically @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic factors @xmath64 are anticipated to obey the known sum rule @xmath65 , where the sum is over all @xmath41li states and @xmath66 is the number of neutrons in the @xmath29 shell . however , the sum over the three @xmath41li states ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ) for the considered sets of the spectroscopic factors substantially deviates from 4 . usually , @xmath70 , which can be explained by a missed contribution of higher @xmath41li states .",
    "spectroscopic factors from @xcite give , however , @xmath71 .",
    "the results obtained with various sets of the spectroscopic factors therefore differ from each other drastically .",
    "but if the spectroscopic factors are renormalized to @xmath72 , the results become more or less compatible with each other . making this renormalization",
    ", we overestimate the spectroscopic factors .",
    "we suggest , however , that the contribution of higher @xmath41li states is taken into account effectively to some extent in this way .",
    "we present mainly the results obtained using the spectroscopic factors from @xcite .",
    "two versions ( labeled as `` with cn '' and `` no cn '' in @xcite ) give results very close to each other .",
    "we use below the former version .",
    "also some examples for other sets are shown .",
    "the signs of the coefficients of fractional parentage are chosen according to the shell model calculation @xcite , where the angular momentum addition scheme is exhibited explicitly , for all the sets .",
    "the single particle wave functions of the proton , neutron , and @xmath2 hyperon needed for calculation of @xmath52 in ( [ e5 ] ) are generated by a standard woods - saxon potential @xmath73 parameters @xmath74 mev , @xmath75 fm , and @xmath76 fm for the proton , and @xmath77 mev , @xmath75 fm , and @xmath78 fm for the neutron are fitted to provide the known separation energies .",
    "for the @xmath2 hyperon , we take @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 fm , and @xmath81 fm , which gives @xmath2 binding energy @xmath82 mev and , thus , @xmath83 mev",
    ". the coulomb potential of the uniformly charged sphere is included for the proton and @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "quantitative knowledge of @xmath22-nucleus interaction is not yet achieved .",
    "the data obtained from the @xmath10 reaction in the kinematical region corresponding to production of a real @xmath0 hyperon @xcite show that the @xmath0-nucleus interaction is repulsive in a wide range of @xmath84 . on the other hand , the data on @xmath0 atoms exhibit attractive shifts ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this seeming contradiction can be reconciled if the potential is mainly repulsive but has an attractive pocket in the peripherical region most important for atomic states @xcite .",
    "shape of the potential can not be fixed from existing data @xcite .",
    "we choose the @xmath85be potential according to @xcite also in form ( [ e9 ] ) with @xmath86 fm and @xmath81 fm . in",
    "most of calculations , we use @xmath87 mev .    .[tab1]@xmath0",
    "admixture probabilities @xmath20 in units of 10@xmath88 for various coupling potentials .",
    "the repulsive @xmath0-nucleus potential ( @xmath87 mev ) and spectroscopic factors from @xcite were used .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ tab2 ] , we show the same probabilities obtained with the coupling potential esc08b and various sets of the spectroscopic factors .",
    "the t1 and t2 versions in @xcite correspond to different optical potentials in the final state used for analysis of the @xmath89li reaction .",
    "ck means the famous cohen - kurath shell model @xcite while vmc refers to a variational monte carlo calculation @xcite ( the corresponding spectroscopic factors are quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "last , the set labeled as sta is taken from compilation @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the probabilities depend on the choice of the spectroscopic factors significantly .",
    "however , this uncertainty is not so drastic as for the coupling potentials .",
    "remind that the spectroscopic factors in all the cases are renormalized as described above .",
    "all the probabilities in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] are obtained with the purely repulsive @xmath85be potential ( @xmath87 mev ) .",
    "we tried to add a small peripherical attractive pocket to this potential .",
    "the probabilities changed very slightly .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 peripherical attraction in this hypernucleus is of small importance .",

    "[ f1 ] , we display the @xmath20 dependence on @xmath90 for the esc coupling potentials . when the diagonal potential becomes attractive ,",
    "the probabilities grow by several times . only for the strongest coupling ( esc08a@xmath61 ) and @xmath91 mev ,",
    "@xmath92 is compatible with 0.18% reported by umeya and harada @xcite .",

    "[ f2 ] shows @xmath92 versus volume integral @xmath93 of the spin - independent coupling potential .",
    "it is seen that @xmath92 is determined mainly by spin - independent coupling potential @xmath94 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath95 is nearly quadratic , which is natural in terms of the perturbation theory .",
    "it is interesting that we could not find a similar simple dependence of @xmath96 on any component ( or some combination of them ) of coupling potential ( [ e8 ] ) , though , of course , stronger coupling potentials lead to greater probabilities .",
    "( color online ) radial wave functions of the @xmath0 component for the esc coupling potentials in comparison with the scaled @xmath2 wave function .",
    "solid ( dashed ) curves are for the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) state.,width=321 ]    finally , we demonstrate wave functions @xmath97 for the esc models in fig .",
    "shape of the wave function ( shown in comparison with the @xmath31 @xmath2 wave function ) clearly reveals its distinction from usual bound state @xmath31 wave functions .",
    "@xmath98 has a minimum at @xmath99 , which is some reminiscence that it can be considered as a superposition of continuum states .",
    "we checked that coulomb @xmath0-nucleus interaction plays a minor role in this problem so atomic bound states contribute little to this superposition .",
    "maybe , the situation is different in heavier systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the wave function drops abruptly at the asymptotics due to the large absolute value of @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 distribution is concentrated near the nuclear surface as already was stressed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we revisit the problem of @xmath0 admixture in the @xmath1li hypernucleus , which is important for understanding of reactions producing neutron - rich @xmath2 hypernuclei .",
    "the simple approach incorporating some features of the shell model enables us to deal with both attractive and repulsive @xmath22-nucleus potentials .",
    "we show that @xmath22-nucleus repulsion reduces the @xmath22 admixture probabilities by several times with respect to attractive potentials .",
    "we can not predict the @xmath0 admixture probabilities since the coupling potential is extremely uncertain . however , our calculations for very different coupling potentials give always @xmath101% , much less than those ( about 0.5% , @xcite ) needed to explain the cross sections of the @xmath102li by the one - step @xmath14 mechanism .",
    "though our model involves some approximations it is unlikely that they can lead to so large underestimation of the probability .",
    "possibly , the so - called `` coherent mixing '' @xcite giving large @xmath22 probabilities in @xmath103h and @xmath103he is especially effective when all the baryons are in the same ( @xmath31 ) state while it is less efficient in @xmath29 shell systems .",
    "therefore , the conclusion that the one - step @xmath14 mechanism is dominant for the @xmath10 reaction @xcite seems to be questionable and further investigations are needed .",
    "possibly , the structure of the @xmath0 component is more complicated .",
    "our tentative estimation indicates that the probability of the @xmath0 hyperon @xmath104 state may be not so small .",
    "the two - step mechanism with meson charge exchange is also not understood completely .",
    "the models applied in @xcite are rather simplified while it is known that dynamics of the similar process , namely , pion double charge exchange , is much more complex .",
    "last , maybe another one - step mechanism , i.e. , production of neutron - rich @xmath2 hypernuclei via @xmath16 admixture in a target nucleus , e.g. , @xmath105 , suggested in @xcite deserves attention .",

    "<S> probability of the @xmath0 admixture for realistic repulsive @xmath0-nucleus potentials is less by several times than that for attractive potentials and does not exceed 0.1% . we conclude that the cross sections of the @xmath3 reaction measured at kek can not be explained by production via @xmath0 admixture as a doorway state . </S>"
