    "the concept of folding has an important place in polymer physics  @xcite . considering a polymer chain made of @xmath0 identical constituents ( the _ monomers _ ) ,",
    "the entropy of such a system can be obtained by counting the number of inequivalent ways of folding the chain onto itself .",
    "if the model of polymer does not take self - avoidance into account , it is then equivalent to the well - known brownian motion .",
    "several more involved models have been proposed which study the _ compact _ folding of a _ self - avoiding _ polymer as a hamiltonian cycle ( i.e. a closed , self - avoiding walk which visits each vertex ) on a regular lattice@xcite .",
    "they can also be defined for some kinds of _ random _ lattices  @xcite , where each configuration is now described by a system of non - intersecting arches which connect the pairs of monomers , which are neighbors in the real space .    in the present paper , the compact folding of a polymer chain",
    "is modeled by a folded strip of stamps , with a complete piling of the strip on top of one stamp  @xcite .",
    "it is then equivalent to another model of non - intersecting arches , the so - called _ meander _ problem , which can be summarized by this simple question : in how many ways @xmath5 can a road cross a river through @xmath0 bridges , and possibly wind around the source .",
    "a related problem can be defined by forbidding the winding around the source ( i.e. the river is infinite at the both ends ) .",
    "it is now equivalent to enumerate the `` simple alternating transit mazes ''  @xcite of depth @xmath0 ; it was also investigated in connection with hilbert 16th problem , namely the enumeration of ovals of planar algebraic curves  @xcite .    by analogy with some models of statistical mechanics like",
    "random walks or self - avoiding walks , the meanders can be described in the language of critical phenomena . in particular , the asymptotic behavior of meanders when @xmath0 is large can be characterized by `` critical '' exponents . however the exact enumeration of meanders is particularly complicated : there is no known formula for @xmath5 in terms of @xmath0 . by generating all possible configurations , by hand or with a computer , the beginning of the sequence @xmath5",
    "can be computed  @xcite exactly .",
    "as @xmath5 increases exponentially with @xmath0 , the limits of computers are reached for @xmath6 and the estimates of the exponents are too inaccurate to validate ( or invalidate ) some conjectures .",
    "one should mention that several exact results , for arbitrarily large @xmath0 , which are unfortunately not helpful to determine the values of the exponents , have been obtained with other techniques : random matrix model methods  @xcite and an algebraic approach using the temperley - lieb algebra  @xcite or the hecke algebra  @xcite .",
    "many models in statistical physics can be studied by monte - carlo ( or stochastic ) methods . with these algorithms , only a small set of configurations among all the possible ones",
    "are generated . in principle , the expectation of physical quantities ( like energy or magnetization ) with a given law of probability ( like the boltzmann law involving an external temperature ) can be estimated from these randomly generated samples , if their probabilities of generation are known .",
    "for example , with the metropolis algorithm for classical spin systems  @xcite , the probability of generation is built to be equal to the boltzmann law and the average is done over the generated configurations with equal weights . to bypass some difficulties ( for example when the phase space has many local minima with high free energy barriers between them ) , it is possible , in principal , to generate the random configurations with another more adapted law and to correct this bias when the average is done  @xcite .",
    "but for the meanders problem , the situation is quite different  : the phase space is not easy to built because the number @xmath5 of configurations is unknown and the only known efficient method to draw a meander of size @xmath0 is a recurrence over @xmath0 .",
    "moreover the nave way to use this recurrence gives a distribution of meanders which is not flat , and this default increases exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "this paper presents a monte - carlo method which explores the meanders with an almost flat distribution law .",
    "furthermore the bias is known and can be corrected exactly .",
    "therefore , the average can be done over meanders with equal probabilities .",
    "in particular , better estimates of critical exponents are obtained .",
    "after section 2 devoted to the definitions , and section 3 which explains the building of meanders by recurrence , section 4 of this paper describes the monte - carlo method .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section 5 .",
    "a _ meander _ of size @xmath0 is a planar configuration of a non - self - intersecting loop ( _ road _ ) crossing a half line ( semi - infinite _ river _ with a _ source _ ) through @xmath0 points ( _ bridges _ ) .",
    "two meanders are considered as _ equivalent _",
    "if their roads can be continuously deformed into each other , keeping the bridges fixed : this is therefore a topological equivalence .",
    "we call an _ arch _ each section of road between two consecutive bridges .",
    "so a meander of size @xmath0 has @xmath0 bridges and @xmath0 arches .",
    "the number of different meanders of size @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "for example , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ m4 ] , the 4 meanders of size 4 are drawn .",
    "the @xmath5 s , up to @xmath11 , can be found in ref .  .",
    "in previous articles  @xcite , these objects were called _ semi_-meanders , to distinguish them from the case where the line is infinite ( river without source ) . in this paper ,",
    "the river is always a half - line and the word _ meanders _",
    "is used for convenience .",
    "we can define  @xcite meanders with @xmath12 _ connected components _",
    ", i.e. made of one river and @xmath12 non - intersecting roads .",
    "but , in this work , we do not include this generalization and we keep @xmath13 .",
    "however the monte - carlo method , used in this article , can be adapted without difficulties to an arbitrary fixed @xmath12 , and even for varying @xmath12 with a fugacity @xmath14 .    as explained with many details in ref .  , the meander problem is absolutely equivalent to the problem of the compact folding of a strip of stamps because each meander of size @xmath0 can be continuously deformed in such a way that the `` road '' becomes a vertical line and the `` river '' becomes a folded strip of @xmath15 stamps .",
    "we prefer to present our results with the meander representation because the main recursion relation , described later , seems more `` natural '' in this picture .",
    "the meander problem has certain similarities with two - dimensional self - avoiding walks : a meander is obtained by intersecting a closed self - avoiding walk by a half - line and keeping only the topological aspect . by analogy , it is expected  @xcite that @xmath16 where the estimates given in ref .",
    "are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the connectivity @xmath19 can be reinterpreted as the average number of ways of adding a bridge close to the source by deforming an arch of a given large meander .",
    "then @xmath20 is the entropy per bridge .",
    "the configuration exponent @xmath21 is sensitive to the boundary conditions , for example whether the road is closed or open , whether the river is infinite or semi - infinite , straight or forked , whether the meander is drawn on a planar surface , a sphere or a surface with higher genus .",
    "conversely , we expect that @xmath19 remains the same for all these boundary conditions .",
    "it is similar in on - lattice self - avoiding walks problem where the connectivity depends on the type of lattice ( square , honeycomb  ) and not on the boundary conditions , whereas the `` universal '' configuration exponent depends on the boundary conditions , but is not sensitive to the small scale details of the lattice . for these reasons",
    ", we think that the numerical value of @xmath19 is valid only for this particular model of meanders . but",
    "@xmath21 is expected to be more `` universal '' and to keep its value in other variants of the meander problem .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical determination of @xmath21 is less precise than @xmath19 , because @xmath22 describes the correction to the leading exponential asymptotic behavior @xmath23 .    for a given meander @xmath24 , the _ winding _ number @xmath25 of the road around the source of the river",
    "can be defined as the minimal number of intersections between the road and a half ( semi - infinite ) line starting at the source and extending the river on the opposite side . for an example , see fig .",
    "we define @xmath26 as the average of the winding number @xmath27 over all the meanders @xmath24 of size @xmath0 .",
    "we can see the winding number as the topological end - to - end distance between the source ( right end of the river ) and the infinite ( left end of the river ) . here",
    "the distance between two points is simply the minimal number of arches which must be crossed to go from one point to the other . by analogy with the end - to - end exponent of self - avoiding walk",
    ", we expect that @xmath28 where the estimate given in ref .",
    "is @xmath29 .",
    "if we study the meanders by leaving free the number @xmath12 of connected components , the problem is equivalent  @xcite to a random walk on a semi - infinite line and can be studied with usual methods of combinatorics . in particular , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the brownian exponent .",
    "but , by fixing @xmath13 , the problem is drastically more difficult and the above values are , to our knowledge , not yet known exactly .    for a given meander @xmath24 of size @xmath0 ,",
    "we label by @xmath33 each segment of river in - between two consecutive bridges , from right to left .",
    "so the rightmost segment ( with source ) is labeled 0 , and the leftmost ( semi - infinite ) segment is labeled @xmath0 .",
    "we define the _ height _ @xmath34 as the number of arches _ over _ the segment @xmath35 , and @xmath36 as the number of arches _ below _ the segment @xmath35 . an example is given in fig .",
    "[ haut ] .",

    "in this section , we describe a recursive algorithm to enumerate and built all meanders of a given size @xmath0 . though it was described in ref .",
    ", we prefer to recall it in details , because the monte - carlo method is based on this recursion .",
    "we have different ways to built a meander of size @xmath56 , starting from a meander of size @xmath0 .",
    "our method consists in adding a bridge on the left most part of the river ( opposite to the source ) and changing the road to cross this new bridge . to keep this change minimal , only an _ exterior",
    "_ arch is modified ( an arch is _ exterior _ when no other arch surrounds it ) .",
    "take a meander of size @xmath0 ( the _ parent _ ) and choose ( or label ) one of its exterior arch . by the process described in fig .",
    "[ recur ] , a meander of size @xmath56 ( the _ child _ ) is built .",
    "a parent has as many different children as exterior arches . by inverting this process",
    ", it appears that each meander of size @xmath56 has one and only one parent .",
    "more precisely , it is a one - to - one mapping between the meanders of size @xmath56 , and the meanders of size @xmath0 with one labeled exterior arch .",
    "the starting point of the recursion is the unique meander of size 1 .",
    "by @xmath15 successive applications of the recursion process , every meanders of size @xmath0 can be built .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ arbre ] , the set of meanders is organized as a _ tree_. the root , at level 1 , is the starting meander @xmath57 .",
    "each branch between a node on level @xmath0 and a node on level @xmath56 represents a relation between a parent of size @xmath0 and its child of size @xmath56 .",
    "apart from @xmath57 , a meander ( or node ) has several exterior arches , then several children ( or branches ) .",
    "their number depends on the precise shape of the parent and varies between 2 and @xmath58 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    if we want to exactly enumerate the @xmath5 meanders of size @xmath0 , the only method we know is to built and investigate the tree up to the level @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", we have not found a direct recursion between the numbers @xmath5 .",
    "the number of children of each meander has a distribution which seems to be erratic and the only way to know it is the examination of its shape .",
    "then , to compute @xmath5 , the work is proportional to @xmath5 . as the @xmath5 s increase",
    "exponentially , the limits of the capabilities of the computers are rapidly reached .    in ref .  , the meanders numbers @xmath5 up to @xmath11 are given .",
    "with a recent computer and more tricks of programming , it is perhaps possible to obtain @xmath59 or 32 .",
    "if the power of computers continues to increase exponentially , the best we can expect with the full enumeration without major improvement , is a linear growth in @xmath0 , with a rate of only one new size every 2 or 3 years .",
    "we have the feeling that this progress is too small to change significantly our understanding of the meanders problem .    in this article",
    ", we will investigate larger @xmath0 with a monte - carlo method increasing more slowly than an exponential .",
    "but , this stochastic method gives results with error bars and the interpretation is more delicate .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the exponential growth of the computations with an exact enumeration method limits the size of meanders around @xmath6 . to reach bigger @xmath0 , it is then natural to try to study this problem with a monte - carlo ( or stochastic ) method .",
    "as the set of the @xmath5 meanders of a given size @xmath0 is too large to be fully explored , the general idea is to randomly select a small subset .",
    "then , the measurements are done and averaged on the selected meanders .",
    "it gives an _ estimator _ of the exact ( but unknown ) result , with a unknown error .",
    "this error has two components : statistical fluctuations and bias .",
    "the statistical fluctuations can be reduced by independently repeating the procedure many times .",
    "then , we obtain a histogram of the estimator , with an average and a variance . under the hypothesis of finite variance",
    ", the statistical fluctuations of the average can be estimated by usual formulas of statistics .",
    "the _ bias _ is the difference between the exact result and the mathematical expectation of the estimator .",
    "if it can be exactly calculated , we subtract it from the estimator .",
    "but , in general , an unknown part remains , which can not be reduced by a better statistics .",
    "as explained below , by adjusting parameters of the simulation , the bias can be reduced to become smaller than the statistical fluctuations .    in this section",
    ", we will first introduce the simplest algorithm , the _ one - squirrel method_. we will see that its statistical fluctuations grow exponentially with @xmath0 and they are too big for @xmath60",
    ". then , we present an algorithm , the _ multi - squirrel method _ , for which the fluctuations increase less rapidly .",
    "the method is based on the recursion relation ( see fig .  [ recur ] ) , with which the set of meanders is organized as a tree ( see fig .  [ arbre ] ) .",
    "the monte - carlo squirrel has the following stochastic behavior .",
    "it starts at the root of the tree ( the meander of size @xmath57 ) .",
    "it climbs into the tree . at each level @xmath0",
    ", it stands on a node and makes some measurements concerning the meander of size @xmath0 , represented by this node .",
    "then the squirrel goes to the level @xmath56 by choosing at random one of the @xmath61 branches , starting from this node .",
    "the squirrel stops at a prefixed level @xmath62 .",
    "this process constitutes _",
    "one _ simulation .",
    "the probability that the squirrel reaches a given meander of size @xmath0 is @xmath63 .",
    "this probability law is not flat because the sequence of @xmath64 depends on the visited nodes . as seen in fig .",
    "[ arbre ] , for @xmath65 , the two meanders on the left side have a probability @xmath66 and the three on the right side have @xmath67 .",
    "so , to correct this bias between meanders , the squirrel has a weight @xmath68 which is calculated during its climbing .    by noting @xmath69 the mathematical expectation ( over all possible simulations ) , it is then obvious that @xmath70 , because the sum runs over @xmath5 possible paths and the contribution of a given path is @xmath71 with probability @xmath72 .    more generally , for some quantity @xmath73 ( for example the winding number ) , we wish to determine @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the value of @xmath73 on the @xmath24-th meander of size @xmath0 .",
    "each simulation gives , at level @xmath0 , a measurement @xmath76 on the meander @xmath77 reached by the squirrel and @xmath78 which is the generalization of @xmath79 obtained with @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 is an _ unbiased _ estimator of @xmath82 ( i.e. @xmath83 ) .    as usual in monte - carlo methods ,",
    "several simulations are made independently and we hope that the average @xmath84 of all the measurements @xmath85 is close to @xmath86 . unfortunately , this method does not work in practice , because the weight @xmath71 is the product of @xmath64 .",
    "although the distribution of each @xmath64 is regular , the product of many random variables is not self - averaging .",
    "as the sum of @xmath87 is self - averaging ( i.e. the observed result is closed to its mathematical expectation when @xmath0 goes to infinite ) , most of the observed @xmath71 are not closed to @xmath88 and @xmath89 increases like an exponential .",
    "then the averages with weight @xmath71 are dominated by exponentially rare events and the statistical fluctuations become large . to keep the observed average close to the mathematical expectation , the number of simulations must increase exponentially with @xmath0 and fluctuations become too big for @xmath90 or 35 .",
    "as the difficulties increase exponentially with @xmath0 ( as for exact enumeration ) , is is useless to increase the power of the computer .",
    "we need a new algorithm .",
    "we generalize the one - squirrel method , but now with a population of @xmath91 squirrels , which reproduce and die ; @xmath91 is a fixed parameter during all the simulations .",
    "it is more simple to choose @xmath91 as @xmath92 , with at the starting point , a squirrel staying at each node of level @xmath93 ( meanders of size @xmath93 ) . in this work ,",
    "@xmath94 and we use the up - down symmetry to reduce the population to @xmath95 squirrels .",
    "the population evolves from level @xmath0 to level @xmath56 by the following process .",
    "each squirrel @xmath35 lives on a node @xmath96 on level @xmath0 , connected to @xmath97 nodes on level @xmath56 .",
    "it reproduces and has @xmath97 children and each child lives on each one of these @xmath97 nodes .",
    "the total number of children @xmath98 is calculated .",
    "the ratio @xmath99 is an estimate of @xmath100 : the average of the number of children per parent .",
    "to prevent an exponential growth of the population and of the needed computer memory and time , the total population is keep constant by decimating the children : only @xmath91 among the @xmath101 children survive .",
    "the choice is made at random with uniform distribution .",
    "then the probability of surviving is @xmath102 .",
    "this decimation is the single monte - carlo step of the algorithm .",
    "this process is iterated up to reach a prefixed level @xmath62 : it gives _",
    "one _ simulation .",
    "many independent simulations are done and averaged .    the particular case @xmath103 gives the previous method with one squirrel .",
    "but , as for @xmath104 , for every value of @xmath91 , the probability that a given meander is reached , is not uniform .",
    "the nodes with small number of `` brothers '' or `` cousins '' have always a small advantage . but",
    "this bias becomes smaller when the population @xmath91 is large .",
    "that is the main improvement of this method .",
    "the limit @xmath105 corresponds to the exact enumeration .    to correct the bias ,",
    "each simulation has a weight @xmath106 and the averages runs over all the simulations with their weight .",
    "more exactly , for some quantity @xmath73 , by keeping the notations of eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) , one simulation with @xmath91 squirrels gives @xmath91 measurements @xmath107 for @xmath108 $ ] with a weight @xmath71 and the estimator @xmath109 is unbiased , i.e. @xmath110 we note that the case @xmath80 gives @xmath111 .",
    "in order to prove eq .",
    "( [ moy ] ) , we define the operator @xmath112 characterizing a given meander @xmath24 by @xmath113 when @xmath114 and 0 otherwise .",

    "it proves that @xmath126 for every meander @xmath24 of size @xmath0 , and eq .",
    "( [ moy ] ) is valid for every operator @xmath73 .    as usual",
    ", many simulations are done and the measurements are averaged with their respective weight . a priori , it seems that this method has the same defect as the _ one_-squirrel method because the weight @xmath71 is the product of many @xmath125 , not self - averaging when @xmath0 becomes large .",
    "the ratio @xmath127 between the mathematical expectation and the most frequently observed @xmath71 increases like an exponential .",

    "a taylor expansion of @xmath131 shows that @xmath132    then , with these simple arguments , we can hope that the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) grows like @xmath133 and that problems appear only when @xmath0 becomes on the same order than @xmath91 . in our simulations , we observe that the fluctuations grow with @xmath0 faster than this optimistic prediction @xmath134 . in fact , the @xmath125 s are not independent and the exponential function accentuates all deviations .",
    "then we supervised carefully the distribution of @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath0 is small , we see a regular bell - shaped curve .",

    "for example , for @xmath1 , with @xmath135 squirrels , the width @xmath136 of the distribution is only 12 % , but we observed rare events with a value of @xmath71 as big as three times the average .",
    "however , in this case , their contribution to the average and fluctuations is not yet problematic .",
    "but , if we let @xmath0 increase without control , rare events will dominate and the results will become hazardous .    how to choose @xmath0 and @xmath91 ?",
    "the nave point of view is to take @xmath0 as bigger as possible .",
    "but , to make @xmath137 independent simulations with @xmath91 squirrels of size @xmath0 , the need for computer memory is of order @xmath138 and the need for computer time is of order @xmath139 . if @xmath91 is large enough , the fluctuations are gaussian and the error bars are of order @xmath140 .",
    "as @xmath0 is always limited , we will extrapolate to study the asymptotic behavior .",
    "for that , it is of no help to have large values of @xmath0 if the error bars are too big .",
