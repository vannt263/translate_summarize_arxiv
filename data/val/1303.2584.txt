    "together with the energy spectrum , the temporal behaviour of gamma  ray burst ( grb ) light curves holds the key to both the physical mechanism responsible for the production of the prompt gamma rays and the distance from the stellar progenitor at which the energy dissipation into gamma  rays takes place .",
    "more than a decade after the first grb afterglow discoveries , these key questions concerning the grb prompt emission are yet to be answered .",
    "the typical observed durations of pulses span from hundreds milliseconds up to several seconds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a proper characterisation of the temporal properties at different energy bands is crucial to provide clues to the energy dissipation process at the origin of the gamma  rays . in this context",
    ", the average power density spectrum ( pds ) provides a way to characterise the phenomenon in terms of a stochastic process starting from the null hypothesis that each long grb is a different realisation of a general unique process . in other words , we assume that the same mechanism can explain the variability observed in different light curves , while the observed variety is due to different conditions , which may vary from different grbs .    the question whether grb light curves might entirely be explained in terms of different realisations of a unique stochastic process characterised by a pure red noise , is still open .",
    "interestingly , recent analyses have found evidence for the presence of deterministic components ( as opposed to pure stochastic noise ) ruling the evolution of a grb light curve and giving rise to a chaotic behaviour @xcite .    in the context of a pure stochastic process entirely characterised by red noise , beloborodov ,",
    "stern & svensson , in 1998 and 2000 ( hereafter , bss98 and bss00 ) , studied the average pds of 527 grbs detected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ; @xcite ) aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) in 252000 kev energy band , revealing a typical power ",
    "law behaviour spanning almost two orders of magnitude in frequency , from a few @xmath6 to @xmath7  hz .",
    "the power ",
    "law index they found is compatible with @xmath3 , which is what one expects for the kolmogorov spectrum of velocity fluctuations within a medium characterised by fully developed turbulence .",
    "they also found a sharp break around 12  hz .",
    "these results were also supported by the integral data analysis of a sample of 10 bright grb @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of the average pds of the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) data set in the 15150  kev energy band was carried out for the first time in the grb rest - frame average , thanks to the large number of grbs detected by swift with measured redshift .",
    "no significant differences were found between the observer and the rest - frame behaviour ( @xcite ; hereafter , g12 ) .",
    "notably , no evidence for the break around 12  hz was found in the 15150  kev band . in the present work we aim to study the average pds in two different unexplored regimes with two different data sets .",
    "the goal of this analysis is twofold : i ) we address the same average pds analysis through two additional data sets from independent satellites and detectors ; ii ) these data sets allow us to study the average pds at very high frequency ( up to 1  khz ) with the _ bepposax_/gamma ",

    "we initially started with 829 grbs detected and covered by gbm from july 2008 to december 2011 .",
    "for each grb we took the two most illuminated nai detectors , for which we extracted the corresponding light curves with 64  ms resolution , which we then added to have a single light curve . in this early stage",

    "spikes caused by radiative decay of some particles dragged in the earth magnetic field that interact with the spacecraft payload were observed in 22 light curves , whose grbs were therefore rejected from our sample @xcite .",

    "following the same procedure by g12 for the _",
    "swift_/bat data , the selection excluded in each sample ( total , low , middle and high energy range ) the grbs whose grouped pds collected less than 4 grouped frequency bins .    we ended up with 205 grbs that will be referred to as the _ fermi _ sample with a 64  ms time resolution in the total energy range and , respectively , we ended up with 155 , 201 and 74 in the three energy sub - bands : 840 , 40200 , and 2001000  kev ( low , middle and high energies ) . the vhr sample includes 96 grbs whose light curves were extracted in the 81000  kev and 40700  kev energy bands . for each of these samples we calculated and modelled the average pds .      for the _ bepposax_/grbm grb sample we started from the grb catalogue @xcite by selecting the grbs fully covered by the high time resolution mode , available only for those which triggered the grbm on - board logic .",
    "we then excluded the grbs whose light curves were hampered by gaps in the time profiles .",
    "finally we selected the grbs with the highest s / n ( @xmath20 ) and ended up with a sample of 89 grbs .",
    "this requirement was motivated by the need of having very good statistical quality even at high frequencies .",
    "two different kinds of time resolution are available in the grbm data : i ) light curves with @xmath21  ms resolution from @xmath22 to @xmath23  s from the on - board trigger time ( hereafter , these curves are referred to as high - resolution or hr curves ) ; ii ) light curves with @xmath24  ms for the first 10  s from the trigger time ( vhr curves ) .",
    "therefore the corresponding nyquist frequencies are respectively 64  hz and 1  khz .",
    "the vhr light curve can be obtained only for a sub - sample of 74 grbs for each grb we extracted the pds in two different time intervals , depending on the type of light curve : the pds of the hr curves was extracted on the @xmath15 , like in the case of _",
    "fermi_/gbm data ( section  [ sec : data_sel_fermi ] ) , whereas that of the vhr curves was forcibly bound to the first 10  s from the trigger time .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] reports the time interval and peak count rate for each selected grb of the hr set .",
    "also for _ bepposax _ data the final pds obtained for each grb of each sub - sample was grouped according to a 3-@xmath14 significance criterion excluding the events of the hr sample with fewer than 4 grouped bins and those with of the vhr sample with fewer than 10 bins .",
    "consequently , the final samples include 42 grbs with hr data and 25 grbs with vhr data .",
    "hereafter , the two samples are referred to as the _ bepposax _ hr and the vhr sample , respectively .",
    "each pds was calculated through the mixed - radix fft algorithm implemented within the gnu scientific library @xcite , which does not require the total number of bins to be a power of 2 @xcite similarly to what was done for the _ swift_/bat sample ( g12 ) .",
    "we calculated the pds for each grbs adopting the leahy normalisation .",
    "for each individual pds the background level , corresponding to the white noise due to counting statistics , was initially estimated by fitting with a constant the high - frequency range , where the signal is negligible with respect to the statistical noise .    within the leahy normalisation",
    ", a pure poissonian noise corresponds to a power value of 2 .",
    "therefore we checked the high - frequency constant value for the power averaged out among all the pdss . for _ fermi _ sample",
    "the mean value of white noise level is estimated at @xmath25 for @xmath17  hz , fully consistent with a poissonian variance .",
    "for the _ bepposax _ samples the pds shows evidence for the presence of a small , significant extra - poissonian variance of @xmath26% and @xmath27% for the hr and the vhr samples , respectively , in addition to the statistical white noise .",
    "these values were estimated in the frequency range above 50  hz .",
    "the statistical noise was removed in two different way for different cases .",
    "for the _ fermi _ sample , noise was assumed to be perfectly poissonian , compatibly with what we found above . instead , for the _ bepposax _ samples it was obtained from fitting the pds with a constant value estimated at sufficiently high frequencies ( @xmath28  hz ) for each event of the hr sample .",
    "the estimated background levels are reported in table  [ tbl-4 ] . as can be seen in table  [ tbl-5 ] for vhr data ,",
    "the white noise becomes dominant already at @xmath29  hz ( at higher frequency compared to the _ fermi _ case ) .",
    "indeed , we did not find significantly different values for the mean power between the two following frequency ranges : @xmath29  hz and @xmath28  hz .    after calculating the white noise level for each grb , we subtracted it and renormalised the pds by the corresponding net variance ( g12 ) .",
    "this choice ensures that all grbs have equal weights in the average pds .",
    "the binning scheme used to average the pds is different for each considered sample . in the _ fermi _ case with 64ms binning time the nyquist frequency is @xmath21  hz , so we defined a uniform frequency binning scheme with a step of @xmath0  hz . at @xmath30",
    "hz we considered two bins , @xmath31  hz  @xmath32  hz and @xmath33  hz @xmath34  hz . the same step is used in the frequency grid defined for the average pds of the hr _ bepposax _ data . in the _ bepposax _",
    "case the pds have correspondingly more frequency bins , due to the higher nyquist frequency .",
    "we took only one single bin from @xmath31  hz and @xmath0  hz . the frequency grid changes for the vhr data : we chose a broader frequency step of @xmath35  hz because the total pds extraction time is limited to 10  s for each _ bepposax _ light curve and this implies a coarser frequency resolution . for the vhr pds we considered 4 bins with step of @xmath36  hz at @xmath37  hz",
    "for each individual grb we calculated the average power in each frequency bin of the corresponding grid described above .",
    "finally , for each frequency bin of the grid we determined the average power over all grbs of a given sample after they had been renormalised .",
    "finally the frequency bins of the average noise  subtracted pds were grouped by requiring at least 3@xmath14 significance to reduce the uncertainties at high frequencies .",
    "the average pds was modelled using a smoothly broken power - law in the same parametrisation as that adopted by g12 , @xmath38^{-1/n } \\qquad , \\label{eq : mod}\\ ] ] where the parameters left free to vary are the break frequency @xmath39 , the two power - law indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and the normalisation parameter , @xmath43",
    ". the smoothness parameter @xmath44 could not be effectively constrained in all cases , thus it was fixed to @xmath45 , corresponding to a relatively sharp break around @xmath39 , for all cases to ensure a more homogeneous comparison between the best - fit values obtained over different sets as well as with previous results obtained from the _ swift _ data . thanks to the central limit theorem , we can assume these variables to be normally distributed .",
    "this allowed us to determine the best - fitting model by minimising the following un - normalised negative log ",
    "likelihood function , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the observed power and frequency of the @xmath49-th bin .",
    "@xmath50 is the number of frequency bins , excluding the nyquist frequency .",
    "table  [ tbl-6 ] reports the best - fit parameters estimated for the average pdss for the different grb samples considered .    for the average _ fermi _ pds extracted in the total energy range 81000  kev ( figure  [ fig02 ] ) with 64ms binning time the best - fitting parameters are @xmath51 , a break at @xmath52  hz above which the pds steepens to @xmath53 .",
    "this slope of the spectra is very similar to the previous values found in the literature related to the grbs detected with batse in similar energy bands ( bss98 , bss00 ) , and in agreement with the value of @xmath3 of a kolmogorov spectrum .",

    "moreover , also for the average pds of _ swift_/bat data ( 15150 kev ) we see a typical slope described with a low  frequency index @xmath58 up to a break frequency around @xmath59  hz , followed by and an index @xmath60 ( g12 ) .",
    "since the break frequency @xmath39 is sensitive to the average characteristic time @xmath61 of typical individual shots roughly as @xmath62 @xcite , the value we found in the _ fermi _ data corresponds to a mean characteristic time of about 3  s.    comparing the average pds of the whole fermi sample with that of the high  quality ( s / n@xmath16 ) subsample extracted with @xmath5ms resolution , the latter data set shows evidence for a further break around 12  hz with respect to the best  fitting model obtained for the former data set ( bottom data in fig .",

    "the behaviour of the average pds at high frequency is thoroughly discussed in section  [ sec : res_sax ] together with _",

    "the index @xmath41 decreases from @xmath63 to @xmath64 moving from 840 to 2001000  kev .",
    "this reflects the known narrowing of pulses with energy , according to which the same grb pulse appears to be narrower and spikier at higher energies @xcite . the same trend was observed in the batse average pds ( bss00 ) , for which the power  law index decreases from @xmath56 in the 2555  kev to @xmath55 above 320  kev .",
    "furthermore , a similar behaviour is observed in the _ swift _ data , with @xmath41 varying from @xmath65 to @xmath66 passing from 1550 to 50150  kev .",
    "we also extracted the light curves in the common energy bands with other instruments so that we can compare results limiting the systematic differences connected with different energy passbands . the average _",
    "fermi_/gbm pds obtained in the typical _ swift_/bat energy range ( 15150  kev ) are perfectly consistent with the analogous results on _ swift_/bat data , as shown in fig .",

    "so the apparently different values at low frequencies between the two spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] is not statistically significant .",
    "we investigated whether the grbs whose light curves can be described as a single fast rise exponential decay ( fred ) show distinctive features in the average pds . to this aim , we selected 10  grb of this kind out of the _ fermi _ sample by visual inspection and calculated the corresponding average pds .",
    "the best - fit parameters in this case are @xmath70 and @xmath71 with a break at about @xmath72  hz ( see table  [ tbl-6 ] ) . that the high - frequency tail of the pds for the fred sample is steeper than that of the whole sample of grbs , agrees with the pds expected for a single fred ( e.g. , see lazzati 2002 )",

    "this treatment implicitly assumed the two data sets to be statistically independent .",
    "although this is not completely true , since the 10  s data of the vhr curves are part of the full profile of about 100  s of hr data , on average the common data amount to 10 - 20% or so . consequently , the expected correlation between the two data set affects the results within a comparable fraction . by adding the vhr sample extracted with _",

    "more specifically , overestimating the white noise could mimic the appearance of an artificial break . to test this possibility , we extracted the average pds _ without _ noise subtraction , keeping the same relative normalisation for each grb as that of the noise  subtracted case .",
    "we fixed the best - fitting model of the noise - subtracted pds obtained above and fitted the white noise with a constant .",
    "figure  [ fig08 ] clearly shows that the break in the average pds occurs when the average signal still dominates the white noise level ( by more than one order of magnitude in the vhr data ) .",
    "this rules out the possibility of the break around 12  hz being the result of biased white noise subtraction and suggests it to be a genuine feature of the average pds at energies above @xmath97  kev .",
    "in general , two distinct sources of time variability have been found to characterise the grb variability : a fast component dominated by the presence of relatively short ( @xmath98  1  s ) pulses and a slow component linked to pulses lasting several seconds @xcite .",
    "these two kinds of dominant time scales should be produced by different mechanisms involved in the physical process , and different explanations in different scenarios are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the simple power  law modelling the average pds and encompassing nearly two orders of magnitude in frequency is suggestive of some kind of scale invariance within the same frequency range , thus confirming the coexistence of multiple characteristic timescales .",
    "the study of the average pds in different energy ranges made possible by _ fermi_/gbm provides clues to better characterise the different aspects of grb time variability .",
    "the observed energy dependence of the power ",
    "law index of the average pds , @xmath41 , in the frequency range @xmath79  hz confirms and extends the results found with previous work and data sets .",
    "indeed , in the 81000 kev band the average pds of long grbs detected with gbm show a broken power ",
    "law behaviour ( @xmath51 , @xmath60 and @xmath99  hz ) with @xmath41 very close to the slope of average pds observed in the batse analysis ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "more specifically , the average pds slope undergoes a steep  to  shallow evolution passing from soft to hard energy channels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the narrowing of pulses with energy : @xcite found a dependence of the average pulse width @xmath101 on energy @xmath102 as @xmath103 , estimated by measuring the average auto - correlation function ( acf ) width for a sample of batse bursts as a function of the energy channel .",
    "in addition to the energy dependence of the average pulse width , also the shape itself and , in particular , the peakedness of the average acf depends on energy ( bss00 ) .",
    "indeed , the energy dependence of the shape of the pulse profile explains the energy dependence of the power  law index : if the shapes of a given pulse at different energies were the same , only the break frequency in the average pds should change correspondingly , while the slope should remain unaffected .",
    "since this is not what is observed , the evolution with energy of the average power  law index in the pds confirms the change in the shape itself of the energy pulse as a function of energy .",
    "obtained from different data sets as a function of energy .",
    "dashed line ( @xmath104 ) illustrates the @xmath41 dependence on energy as estimated from fermi data.,width=321 ]    another important result that emerged from the present analysis is the break revealed around 12  hz in the _ bepposax _ average pds .",
    "although the evidence for it in the _ fermi _ data alone is less compelling because of the lower s / n in that frequency range , the _ fermi _ average pds is fully compatible with it . the joint",
    "bepposax__fermi _ analysis of such high  frequency break shows that this may significantly vary between 1 and 2  hz , depending on the grb sample and on its average s / n .",
    "together with results obtained on _ swift _ data by g12 , this break becomes evident at harder energies .",
    "this feature in the average pds and its possible dependence on energy provides an important clue to constraining theoretical models proposed to explain the physical mechanism involved in grbs and confirms and strengthens the analogous result obtained by bss00 on batse data .",
    "the break could be related to an average intrinsic variability time scale , @xmath105  s , below which the temporal power changes regime .",
    "this may link directly to the central engine .",
    "alternatively , it could be related to the variation of the outflow lorentz factor , or it could depend on the radius at which the expanding shell becomes optically thin @xmath106 . in this latter scenario",
    "we could observe variability only on time scales longer than a characteristic time @xmath107 ( bss00 ) .",
    "a number of theoretical interpretations of the power  law pds with an index compatible with @xmath3 have been put forward in the literature .",
    "this is what is expected for a kolmogorov spectrum within a medium with fully developed turbulence .",
    "for instance , in the internal shock model , the parameters of the wind of relativistic shells can be constrained so as to reproduce the observed average pds @xcite ; or in the context of a relativistic jet making its way out through the stellar envelope of the progenitor star @xcite . within other scenarios ,",
    "in which the dissipation into gamma  rays is magnetically driven , the observed features of the average pds in the frequency range from a few @xmath0 to 12  hz can also be explained ( e.g. , zhang & yan 2011 ) .",
    "again , alternatively the observed temporal properties could be driven by instabilities in the accretion disc of potentially different origins : erratic episodic accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; hydrodynamical or magnetic origin ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "magneto  rotational origin , in which neutrino cooling is the dominant process @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to g12 for a more detailed discussion of the predictions of the various theoretical models with reference to the average pds properties .",
    "we studied the properties of the average pds of grbs in two unexplored regimes : across a broadband energy range from 8  kev to 1  mev using _",
    "fermi_/gbm data and up to very high frequencies ( up to 1  khz ) using _ bepposax_/grbm data .    in agreement with previous results obtained from an analogous analysis of _ cgro_/batse and of _ swift_/bat data",
    ", we also found a clear relation between the average pds slope from @xmath108 to @xmath7  hz range and energy , with the index spanning the range from @xmath109 to @xmath110 from @xmath111  kev through @xmath35  mev in three channels ( 840 , 40200 , and 2001000  kev ) .",
    "the slope of the average pds carries information about the spikiness of light curve as well as the multiple presence of several characteristic time scales ( scale invariance within the two decades of the aforementioned frequency range ) .    for the first time we extended the study of pds up to 1  khz in frequency with the very high time resolution provided by",
    "_ bepposax_/grbm . in this case , the average pds pinned down a clear break at 12  hz .",
    "this provides a strong clue to the dominant minimum variability time , potentially connected with either the intrinsic inner engine variability , or with the dispersion of the bulk lorentz factor distribution for a wind of relativistic shells , or with the average distance at which internal collisions dissipate energy into gamma  rays . combining our results with those obtained from the _ swift _ data set ,",
    "the presence of this break emerges only in the harder energy channels ( @xmath112  kev ) .",
    "the average slope is broadly consistent with the theoretically appealing value of @xmath3 expected for a kolmogorov spectrum of velocities within a fully turbulent medium , as suggested in previous works ( bss98 , bss00 ) .",
    "our results in the frequency range @xmath113 to @xmath7  hz are in broad agreement with a number of theoretical interpretations within different alternative contexts , encompassing the classical internal shock scenario as well as the magnetically  dominated outflows models . instead ,",
    "still missing is a detailed theoretical explanation for the other two properties : i ) the presence of the 12  hz break and its energy dependence ; ii ) the energy dependence of the average power  law index .",
