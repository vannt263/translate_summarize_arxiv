    "this paper deals with the conceptual problem of defining the fundamental quantity , the chemical potential , in statistical mechanics .",
    "understanding of this matter is important in many places in physics and chemistry . that the account in the present literature is badly confused",
    "will become clear just below . to gain this understanding ,",
    "i have found that the relation between equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics has to be reconsidered .",
    "two distinct issues are discussed here .",
    "one is the definition of the chemical potential , which i will call c.p . until the question is resolved .",
    "the other is the question of the accuracy of the thermodynamic limit for a piece of a semiconductor as large as a @xmath0 .",
    "we begin with a specific example , an ideal semiconductor , that serves to introduce both issues ; later , other quite different , models and related experiments are used to illustrate the issue of definition in connection with very small systems .",
    "recently , shegelski  @xcite defined the quantity @xmath2 as being the c.p . of an @xmath3-electron system .",
    "here @xmath4 is the helmholtz free energy , as calculated in the canonical ensemble , and the difference is taken at constant temperature @xmath5 and volume @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite within the usual non - interacting - electron model ( nem ) of an intrinsic semiconductor with @xmath3 electrons  @xcite , he found the following : the behavior of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath5 differs appreciably , at moderately low @xmath5 , from the usual result  @xcite for the chemical potential , * even for systems with volumes the size of the universe ! * , although in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath8 fixed ) @xmath9 the usual result for all @xmath10 .",
    "he finds @xmath11 at @xmath12 for any finite volume @xmath6 , where @xmath13 is the energy at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "in contrast , the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) of @xmath14 as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the energy at the top of the valence band ; i.e. the thermodynamic limit of @xmath7 approaches the middle of the band gap , as does the usual result .",
    "shegelski s result behaves qualitatively exactly as one would expect without calculation : at @xmath17 , the ground state energy for @xmath3 particles , so that for the model considered @xmath11 , as easily shown from the expression for @xmath18 . and at @xmath10 ( see  @xcite and appendix b in @xcite)@xcite , in the tl @xmath19 the derivative taken at constant @xmath5 .",
    "( @xmath20 is the limiting function  @xcite . )",
    "thus this is the usual result , approaching the middle of the gap as @xmath15 .",
    "the equality is formal , presented to exhibit the last form as the usual definition of the c.p . in thermodynamics  @xcite , where @xmath3 is assumed to be continuous .",
    "what is surprising and most interesting are the enormous finite - size corrections .",
    "such a scenario where the tl can not be essentially reached with a @xmath0 sample is certainly discomforting , but in light of shegelski s results , clearly must be considered , as done below .",
    "these results force extra care with terminology .",
    "i will use the term ` macroscopic ' to mean systems with roughly avogadro s number of particles , to within a few factors of 10 either way , to be contrasted with the tl .",
    "i will mean by ` finite systems ' those with the number of particles ranging from a few ( say 1,2, ... 100 ) up to macroscopic size .",
    "i will also use the term ` small systems ' to denote those with a few particles .",
    "first i note that the identification of @xmath21 with the c.p . is found elsewhere , e.g in the book by ashcroft and mermin .",
    "@xcite landsberg and browne  @xcite also apparently accept @xmath21 as the c.p .",
    ": in reference to shegelski  @xcite they state ",
    "it is confirmed that the fermi level of an intrinsic semiconductor goes to the bottom of the conduction band as @xmath22 . \" but they note that  however the loss of one electron is sufficient to make it go to the top of the valence band , and for some purposes it may be adequate to take an average of the two values \" . evidently they are identifying the c.p . with the fermi level , and they seem to be saying that the c.p . is not a uniquely defined quantity .",
    "another definition is given in the book by kittel and kroemer  @xcite , namely the c.p .",
    "for an @xmath3-particle system is identified with @xmath23 this being the top of the valence band at @xmath12 in the nem .",
    "fetter and walecka  @xcite give both  ( [ h.1 ] ) and  ( [ h.3 ] ) at @xmath12 ( they confine themselves to the tl , but as we have seen , these differ for our model semiconductor , even in the tl ) .",
    "hill  @xcite , considering general @xmath5 and small systems , gives  ( [ h.1 ] ) but notes that  ( [ h.3 ] ) would be just as good a choice .",
    "chaikin and lubensky  @xcite define the chemical potential , in the context of thermodynamics , as the change in internal energy produced by addition of one particle , apparently supporting ( [ h.1 ] ) .",
    "baierlein  @xcite gives c.p .",
    "@xmath24    perdew et al  @xcite showed for systems with @xmath25 electrons that the zero-@xmath5 limit of the quantity @xmath26 that appears in the grand canonical density operator ,",
    "@xmath27/tr\\ exp[-\\beta(h-\\nu n)],\\label{h.4}\\ ] ] is @xmath28,\\label{h.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , and @xmath25 is the average value of the number of particles , taken to be integral@xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite . since @xmath26 is also quite generally called the chemical potential , we clearly have another definition of the c.p .",
    "it is the average of @xmath21 and @xmath30 at @xmath12 , mentioned in  @xcite .    for metals ,",
    "the various formulas give essentially the same result for @xmath31 .",
    "it is for small systems , ( e.g. a na atom or a quantum dot ) and for semiconductors that one needs to be concerned about the difference between them .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) that in the tl , within the nem , the average occupation number of a 1-electron state with energy @xmath32 is the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath33^{-1}.\\label{h.6}\\ ] ] in the well known and very simple derivation of ( [ h.6 ] ) via the grand canonical ensemble , _ the quantity @xmath26 is the same as that appearing in _",
    "( [ h.4 ] ) , ( [ h.6 ] ) _ holding independently of system size_. it is also well known that , as we have said , in the thermodynamic limit taken at @xmath10 , within the nem , @xmath26 , ( the quantity usually actually calculated as the c.p . in the nem ) , approaches ( [ h.5 ] ) , which is the middle of the gap for the semiconductor model , as @xmath22 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "but we need to be concerned about the role of finite size , as we said .",
    "note that ( [ h.5 ] ) can be written @xmath34,\\label{h.7}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are respectively the ionization energy and electron affinity of the @xmath25-electron system at @xmath12 .",
    "parr et al  @xcite note that this is closely related to a formula due to mulliken  @xcite , who spoke of the electronegativity ( e.n . ) rather than the chemical potential , and gave a formula for e.n . as the negative of ( [ h.7 ] ) .",
    "see also gyftopoulos and haftopoulos@xcite who simply define e.n . as -@xmath26",
    "( arguing that  since @xmath26 is interpreted as the escaping tendency ( the opposite of the power to attract ) of a component from a thermodynamic system , it is reasonable to use its negative as a measure of electronegativity \" ) , and  @xcite for related discussion .",
    "it appears that the analysis in  @xcite is approximate , involving tight - binding molecular orbitals and hartree - fock approximation ; whereas ( [ h.5 ] ) was proved more generally ( also see below ) .",
    "thus we have several distinct definitions for the chemical potential appearing in the literature . for mathematics",
    "only , one can take his / her pick",
    ". however , there is an important piece of physics that removes this arbitrariness , in my opinion .",
    "namely , the condition for equilibrium with respect to particle flow between two systems at the same temperature is that their chemical potentials be equal , the chemical potentials in this context being defined as the values of @xmath26 appearing in their respective distributions ( [ h.4 ] ) ( see e.g. tolman  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , thinking in terms of experiment , equilibrium , i.e. zero current , will occur e.g. between a metal and a semiconductor in contact and at the same @xmath5 when @xmath26 for the semiconductor equals that in the metal . in standard thermodynamics , it is the relation  ( [ h.2 ] ) , @xmath36 , plus minimization of the total free energy , that leads to this fundamental equilibrium condition .",
    "@xcite    in section ii , i argue that the grand canonical ensemble is the proper basis for a theory of statistical thermodynamics , and correspondingly , it is @xmath26 that is uniquely the appropriate meaning of the c.p .",
    "the argument is supported by two very - small - system examples , a quantum dot and a pair of atoms contemplating charge transfer .    in section iii ,",
    "i discuss the zero - t limit of @xmath26 , both for finite systems , and , in the case of solids , whether the limit is taken before or after the tl .",
    "section iv describes a simple calculation of @xmath26 for a finite semiconductor within the same nem discussed above , with attention to the approach to the tl .",
    "it is shown that this quantity does not show the strange huge finite - size effects found for @xmath21 , @xmath26 being very close to the tl for macroscopic size , at all @xmath5 . in the appendix",
    "i give a somewhat simpler calculation than shegelski s which supports his finding of a huge finite - size effect ( this shows up for @xmath37 corresponding to the neutral semiconductor ) .    as in the relevant references",
    "cited  @xcite@xmath38 @xcite@xmath39@xcite@xmath38@xcite , we will be considering the very common one - component model where the electrons move in a fixed one - electron potential .",
    "however , the considerations of sections ii and iii , with the exception in the latter of the quantum dot model , are more general : they allow for the adjustment of the one - electron potential as one adds or removes electrons .",
    "e.g. , in the hydrogen molecule , the equilibrium separation of the protons will differ for the neutral and for the charged cases , such adjustments being allowed for in the formalism ; a given molecule in the usual chemical sense has a given number of nuclei with different degrees of ionization .",
    "alternately , when we consider the thermodynamic limit of a solid , we add nuclei as we add electrons in the customary way : in calculating the tl of @xmath40 for the semiconductor , the net charge is kept constant ( at 0 ) ; similarly , for @xmath41 , the net charge is again held constant ( at 1 electronic charge ) .",
    "also , the generalization to multi - component systems of the final choice of definition of the c.p . is mentioned in the next section .",
    "i mention here that in section iv ( final remarks ) , i emphasize the fact that the ideal intrinsic semiconductor is quite special ( anomalous ) , and although it is clearly of considerable pedagogical importance , the very - small - system examples are of more physical interest .",
    "the usual definition of @xmath4 is via the canonical ensemble : @xmath42,\\label{h.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the energy eigenvalues for states of @xmath3 particles .",
    "we have assumed that the hamiltonian and the operator @xmath45 for the number of particles commute .",
    "@xmath3 is of course discrete , so that differentiation with respect to @xmath3 is not defined .",
    "if an analytic expression for @xmath40 were known , then , for large @xmath3 , continuing the function to continuous @xmath3 would make sense ; e.g. if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 , which approaches @xmath48 for large @xmath3 . but",
    "generally such knowledge is not available ; while interpolating in some smooth way between the integer values might be satisfactory , this entails some loss of rigor , and might be troublesome , particularly for small systems .",
    "surely this has been the motivation behind _ defining _ the chemical potential in terms of finite differences of @xmath40 as in ( [ h.1 ] ) and ( [ h.3 ] ) .",
    "a similar situation exists for the other commonly discussed distributions , microcanonical , or the gibbs distribution ( fixed @xmath5 and pressure ) , with the exception of the grand canonical ensemble . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath3 is merely a summation variable , the role of the number of particles is played by the average value of @xmath3 , @xmath49}}{\\sum_{j , n}e^{-\\beta[e_j(n)-\\nu n}]},\\label{h.11}\\ ] ] which is a continuous variable at @xmath10 .    in standard statistical thermodynamics , each of the various distributions gives",
    "rise naturally to a corresponding thermodynamic potential or free energy .",
    "e.g. , the canonical ensemble gives directly the helmholtz free energy : defining the entropy as @xmath50tr@xmath51 where @xmath52exp@xmath53 , and the trace is taken over states with fixed number of particles @xmath3 , one sees easily that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 = average energy ) . and @xmath4 comes out directly as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "in thermodynamic theory  @xcite , knowledge of @xmath57 as a function of the variables indicated , the natural variables  @xcite for @xmath4 , is a fundamental equation ; that is , from it one can calculate all thermodynamic properties , including other free energies _ and the chemical potential_. similarly , the grand canonical ensemble gives the grand canonical free energy , called the thermodynamic potential by landau and lifschitz  @xcite , @xmath58\\label{h.13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the grand canonical partition function , which is given directly in terms of the variables @xmath59 , the natural variables for @xmath60 .",
    "( the trace here differs from that for the canonical ensemble in that here it involves summing over energy states with various numbers of particles . ) in this case the entropy is @xmath61 tr @xmath62 ln @xmath62 where @xmath62 is the grand canonical density operator ( [ h.4 ] ) . using this",
    "we see that @xmath63 where @xmath64}}{\\sum_{j , n } e^{-\\beta[e_j(n)-\\nu n]}}. \\label{h.16}\\ ] ] the change in notation , e.g. @xmath65 , is made to distinguish between quantities calculated in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "such a distinction is unnecessary , but , again , we have to consider finite size effects . from the mathematics of thermodynamic theory , knowing @xmath60 as a function of @xmath59 , we can construct all thermodynamic quantities .",
    "however , the corresponding helmholtz free energy @xmath66 , internal energy @xmath67 and entropy @xmath68 will differ from their corresponding quantities @xmath69 by virtue of the different ensembles being used in the two cases .",
    "in particular , @xmath66 is calculated via ( [ h.15 ] ) : @xmath70    the continuous nature of @xmath71 allows differentiation of  ( [ h.17 ] ) with respect to @xmath71 ; doing this at constant @xmath5 and volume @xmath6 , and recognizing the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath26 generated by  ( [ h.11 ] ) , yields the identity @xmath72 as is well known ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is of course recognized as the historical thermodynamic relation between the chemical potential and the helmholtz free energy .",
    "but note that it is exact even for finite systems ; the tl is not required for its validity .",
    "now consider the _ * definition of the chemical potential*_. it is clear that choosing @xmath21 or @xmath30 would be entirely arbitrary , so neither is satisfactory .",
    "the average of these would be a guess , as would be either of them ; i.e. , the only basis for such guesses ( apparently ) is that they reduce to the thermodynamic definition in the tl , and of course there is an infinity of such guesses .",
    "the idea that the c.p . can be chosen in various ways  @xcite is unacceptable , for reasons already stated .",
    "thus , in light of  ( [ thermomu ] ) , and the role of the chemical potential in particle transport as argued by tolman , plus the rather universal understanding of this role ( see e.g. @xcite ) , i suggest that the proper definition of the chemical potential is @xmath73 ( i have now bestowed on this the symbol @xmath1 , used almost universally for the chemical potential . ) given this definition , most of the other standard thermodynamic relations follow , i.e. all that do nt depend on the assumption of extensivity of the  extensive \" variables , or in other words the assumption that @xmath74 is a homogeneous first order function .",
    "e.g. , it is well - known that , along with  ( [ h.14 ] ) and  ( [ thermomu ] ) , the relations @xmath75 where @xmath76 follow directly from the definitions given .",
    "but in general one does _ not _ have the relations that follow from the extensivity hypothesis@xcite : @xmath77 well , so be it  the physical information contained in the density matrix relating to the average  extensive \" quantities is given only by the thermodynamic _",
    "_ eq__ualities listed plus other relations derivable from these .",
    "the inequalities listed are written by hill  @xcite through the definitions @xmath78 ; then @xmath79 of course @xmath80 in the tl .",
    "clearly the only statistical approach that allows the rigorous connection to thermodynamics ,  ( [ thermomu ] ) , is through the grand canonical ensemble ( among the usually considered ensembles ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that for finite systams _ the grand canonical ensemble is the only legitimate choice from the point of view of statistical thermodynamics , whenever the chemical potential is relevant_. the view proposed is simply that all of statistical thermodynamics where the chemical potential is physically relevant be carried out on the basis of the grand canonical ensemble.@xcite this then obviates the apparent necessity to define the c.p .",
    ", _ ad hoc _ , as some functional of a free energy defined only on the integers .",
    "i will work with this new view and the definition  ( [ h.18 ] ) henceforth.@xcite    the above argument deserves further scrutiny .",
    "tolman s proof about equality of @xmath1 being the condition of zero particle flow between two systems assumes that at thermal equilibrium the energy eigenvalues are the sums of the eigenvalues of the two systems .",
    "this is essentially the same assumption made in regard to the similar question regarding the relation between temperature and heat flow ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption of additivity was justified because the individual systems being considered were macroscopic .",
    "however , the assumption can be questioned for finite systems , or where finite - size  corrections \" are being investigated , as is our main interest here . in this connection",
    ", it has been shown that under the appropriate conditions , the neglect of the interaction between a reservoir and a small system , is justified for the purpose of considering thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xcite the appropriate conditions are physically sensible requirements on the reservoir ( beyond being large ) , and small enough reservoir - system interactions . these lead at equilibrium to a well - defined temperature @xmath5 of the small system , this @xmath5 , along with the concept of heat flow , having typical attributes of temperature for large systems , in the sense of energy exchange between the small system and the reservoir .",
    "we expect ( and assume ) that a similar result will hold for the chemical potential and particle flow .",
    "in support of that expectation , we consider two examples based in physical reality , ( a ) the case of quantum dots , and ( b ) the prediction of ionicity in diatomic molecules ( and some related solids ) .",
    "\\(a ) experiments on quantum dots indicate strongly that under appropriate conditions , one can ascribe with high certainty whether there is one or two , etc .",
    "electrons on the dot .",
    "@xcite one might worry that description by a grand canonical ensemble , which gives fluctuations in the number of particles , which might be large for small systems , would therefore contradict these experimental results .",
    "further , while i believe the physics of these experiments is well understood , there is confusion about the concept of the chemical potential of the dot , at least in some writings .",
    "the following extremely simple example shows that the grand canonical ensemble can answer the question about the fluctuations , and illustrates how a proper understanding of the chemical potential gives a picture consistent with experiments .",
    "we consider the single - site hubbard model , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the electron - electron coulomb interaction , @xmath83 is the occupation number for a spin-@xmath84 electron , and @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is the ionization potential when there is 1 electron .",
    "this was used in previous considerations of a pair of quantum dots ( plus an inter - dot hopping term ) .",
    "@xcite recognizing that 2@xmath87 , one sees that it is essentially the capacitive term also used to represent the so - called  charging energy \" in many single - dot models .",
    "@xcite there are only 4 states in the model , with just 3 values of @xmath88 , namely , 0,1,2 .",
    "the grand canonical distribution readily yields the ( grand ) partition function @xmath89 , the average number of particles @xmath90 , and the mean square fluctuation @xmath91 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : naverage ] for the typical values",
    "@xcite @xmath92mev , @xmath93 ; @xmath94 has been put to 0 , amounting merely to a shift in the zero of @xmath1 ( from -@xmath94 ) . it is seen     and its mean square fluctuations vs. @xmath1 in mev .",
    "( @xmath92 mev . ) ]    that plateaus occur at integer values of @xmath90 , and for @xmath1 in the corresponding range , the fluctuations in @xmath88 are negligible .",
    "thus small fluctuations have been achieved because the temperature is low compared to @xmath55 , rather than for the usual reason , large system size .",
    "the plateaus in @xmath90 illustrate the coulomb blockade , commonly discussed in connection with transport experiments ,  @xcite , but see  @xcite .",
    "( if @xmath95 would rise directly to the value 2 , the plateau at @xmath96 not occurring . )",
    "this effect is already well - known in atoms , it being the result of the coulomb repulsion , manifested in the fact that the ionization potential exceeds the electron affinity ( a picture for the lithium atom quite similar to @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig : naverage ] appears in  @xcite ) .",
    "the present discussion is strictly within thermodynamic equilibrium , the relation with transport measurements being that the conductance of the dot is small in the plateau regions , and large in the transition regions .",
    "the basic idea of the experiments can be understood in some detail on the basis of this simple model , provided we recognize the fundamental physical meaning of the chemical potential regarding electron flow , as discussed above .",
    "one of the types of experiments , called single - electron capacitance spectroscopy  @xcite , is essentially an equilibrium experiment .",
    "it can be idealized by a system consisting of a metal lead connected to the dot through a tunnelling barrier , as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : dotpicture ] .",
    "the proximity of the dot to the lower lead ( the reservoir ) is meant to indicate that the barrier between the dot and that lead is small , the tunnelling time @xmath97 being short , the barrier to the upper lead being very large , so tunnelling through that is negligible .",
    "@xcite the potential of the dot relative to the lead is controlled by a gate voltage @xmath6 , which has a dc and a small ac component .",
    "the energy of electrons on the dot due to this potential is @xmath98 , @xmath99 being the potential on the dot , proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "( we assume negligible potential variation over the dot . also ,",
    "@xmath100 = magnitude of the electron charge . ) on adding this term to the hamiltonian  ( [ hubbard ] ) , one readily sees that @xmath90 is a function of @xmath1 and @xmath101 only through the sum : @xmath102 .",
    "consider first the case where there is only a dc component .",
    "for a fixed @xmath6 the system will come to equilibrium , so that @xmath103 , the fermi energy of the lead . for small @xmath6 , @xmath104 will deviate from its zero-@xmath6 value @xmath105 by a term linear in @xmath6 , so that @xmath106 , @xmath107 = constant .",
    "hence , by varying @xmath6 slowly ( rate @xmath108 , the equilibration rate ) , one can scan through the abscissa of fig .",
    "[ fig : naverage ] .",
    "the ac component is introduced to help detect the signal ; its frequency is small compared to @xmath109 , so that at each instant the system can still be considered as essentially being in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "hence @xmath110 even in this case . through this , the experiment directly measures the charging of the dot , i.e. @xmath111 ( the capacitance of the dot , whence the terminology capacitance spectroscopy ) , @xmath112 .",
    "@xcite this derivative is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : naverage ] to consist of sharp peaks at the points where an electron is added to the dot , as observed and interpreted in ref .",
    "@xcite . since the derivative is proportional to the fluctuations in @xmath88 , the peaks in these experiments are directly proportional to those seen in the lower curve , fig .  [",
    "fig : naverage ] , although in the experiment , @xmath5 is considerably lower than assumed for the figure , so the observed peaks are much sharper .",
    "( also , the experiment considers the number of electrons going up to remarkably larger values than 2 , because the dot there has many more bound states than the model taken here for simplicity .",
    ")  @xcite    in references  @xcite one finds the chemical potential of the dot defined at @xmath12 as @xmath113 ( ( [ h.3 ] ) above ) and @xmath114 ( ( [ h.1 ] ) above ) , respectively .",
    "these definitions present a problem , seen as follows . for our model  ( [ hubbard ] ) with @xmath115 , @xmath116 . at @xmath55 on the horizontal axis , @xmath90 is either undefined ( at @xmath12 ) , or 3/4 ( in the limit @xmath15 , as seen in the next section ) . but presumably @xmath117 is supposed to be the chemical potential for particle number @xmath118 , and hence it is either undefined or self inconsistent .",
    "a similar argument holds for the other definition .",
    "in fact , at @xmath12 , @xmath119 , for @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath25 is an integer ( see  ( [ h.26 ] ) ) . furthermore , even in the zero-@xmath5 limit",
    ", there is not just one possible value of the chemical potential , as apparently implied by each of these works ; ( [ h.26 ] ) shows that there are three possible values of @xmath122 for @xmath71 in the range @xmath123 , two for non - integer @xmath71 , one for integer @xmath124 .",
    "( this is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : naverage ] for @xmath125 if one imagines the step - function limit of @xmath90 as @xmath15 . )",
    "\\(b ) we consider the example discussed in  @xcite , namely the question of charge transfer in typical ",
    "ionic \" diatomic molecules , but with a bit more emphasis on the role of the chemical potential . if our molecule is bc , then at very large separation @xmath126 we know empirically that for minimum energy , atoms b and c are neutral ( since either @xmath127 is @xmath128 either @xmath129 for neutral atoms ) .",
    "as @xmath126 decreases , one considers the possibility of charge transfer .",
    "the direction of this transfer , if it occurs , is determined of course by which direction gives minimum energy ; but i want to see how this depends on the chemical potentials of the atoms .",
    "let the numbers of electrons on the respective neutral atoms be @xmath130 .",
    "the energies for the two directions of transfer are , for large @xmath126 , @xmath131 where the leading term of the interaction energy @xmath132 is @xmath133 , but can also contain higher polarization terms ; @xmath134 is the energy of the isolated atom @xmath135 .",
    "thus , using  ( [ h.5 ] ) , @xmath136 showing that electron transfer from high to low chemical potential gives lower energy .",
    "this is of course consistent with our requirement on a proper definition of the c.p .",
    "as noted in the introduction , perdew et al .",
    "@xcite derived ( [ h.5 ] ) for finite systems , allowing for exact treatment of electron - electron interactions . here",
    "we discuss the derivation , generalizing it , and in addition , consider , for a semiconductor , taking the limit @xmath22 _ after _ the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) .",
    "it is well known that for the non - interacting - electron model ( nem ) , the two limits commute for the semiconductor , i.e. when the number of electrons exactly fills the valence band ( see e.g. section iv ) . that this however is not true in general is rather obvious ; it will be discussed below .",
    "we will also calculate the zero - t limit of @xmath71 .",
