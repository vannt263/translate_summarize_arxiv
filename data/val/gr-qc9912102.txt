    "the advent of large scale laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors promises to lead to the direct detection of gravitational radiation , which will create a new observational field of science : gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "the introduction of gravitational waves into the retinue of astronomical observations will yield important new information about the dynamics of astrophysical systems , and will also provide an excellent opportunity to conduct new tests of gravity .    proposed space - based laser interferometers , such as the lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) @xcite and omega ( orbiting medium explorer for gravitational astrophysics ) @xcite observatories , will be particularly well poised to begin astrophysical studies since there are known sources of gravitational radiation which will be easily visible to these instruments , namely interacting binary white dwarf ( ibwd ) star systems .",
    "the ibwd sources are particularly appealing targets because they are good candidates for simultaneous optical and gravitational wave observations .",
    "many of the ibwds which are known to exist are being studied and monitored by the center for backyard astrophysics ( cba ) , and are expected to be strong sources of monochromatic gravitational waves which should be easily visible to an instrument such as lisa with only a few minutes of signal integration .",
    "simultaneous optical and gravitational wave observations will be useful in refining the current physical models used to describe these systems , and for testing relativistic theories of gravity in the radiative regime by comparing the propagation speeds of electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals .",
    "this paper examines how the comparison of the phase of the orbitally modulated electromagnetic signal ( the light curve ) and a gravitational wave signal from an ibwd star system can be used to bound the mass of the graviton .",
    "if the mass of the graviton is assumed to be known by other measurements , then the observations may be used to determine the properties of the binary star system being monitored .",
    "current conservative bounds on the graviton mass come from looking for violations of newtonian gravity in surveys of planetary motions in the solar system .",
    "if gravity were described by a massive field , the newtonian potential would have yukawa modifications of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass of the source of the potential , and @xmath4 is the compton wavelength of the graviton , where @xmath5 is the graviton mass .",
    "the current best bound on the graviton mass from planetary motion surveys is obtained by using kepler s third law to compare the orbits of earth and mars , yielding @xmath6 km ( @xmath7 ev ) @xcite .",
    "another bound on the graviton mass can be established by considering the motions of galaxies in bound clusters @xcite , yielding @xmath8 km ( @xmath9 ev ) .",
    "this bound , while stronger than solar system estimates , is considerably less robust , due to uncertainty about the matter content of the universe on large scales ( _ e.g. _ , the amount and nature of dark matter is widely debated , and uncertain at best ) .    recent work by will @xcite has suggested that the mass of the graviton could be bounded using gravitational wave observations .",
    "if the graviton is a massive particle , then the speed of propagation of a gravitational wave will depend on its frequency .",
    "as binary systems evolve , they will slowly spiral together due to the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "over the course of time , the frequency of the binary orbit rises , ramping up rapidly in the late stages of the evolution , just prior to coalescence .",
    "laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors should be able to track the binary system s evolution , obtaining the detailed time - dependent waveform using the matched filtering techniques required for data analysis in these detectors .",
    "space - based detectors such as lisa will be able to observe the coalescence of massive ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) binary black holes , as well as the gravitational wave emission from compact binary star systems which are far from coalescence ( _ e.g. _ , interacting binary white dwarfs ) .",
    "ground - based detectors such as ligo will be able to detect the merger of smaller black hole binaries ( @xmath12 ) , as well as the coalescence of compact binary stars ( _ e.g. _ , neutron star / neutron star binaries ) .",
    "if the graviton is a massive particle , then the observed signal will not perfectly match theoretical templates computed using general relativity theory , in which the graviton is massless ; a massive graviton would cause dispersion in the gravitational waves . by using",
    "matched filtering of inspiral waveforms , this dispersion could be bounded , thereby bounding the mass of the graviton .",
    "will @xcite finds that ligo could bound the graviton mass at @xmath13 km ( @xmath14 ev ) by observation of the inspiral of two @xmath15 black holes . a space - based interferometer such as lisa , observing the inspiral of two @xmath16 black holes could bound the graviton mass at @xmath17 km ( @xmath18 ev ) .",
    "if the graviton is massive , then these numbers represent the minimum masses detectable by such observations .",
    "the analysis in this paper shows that lisa observations of known ibwd sources could yield a bound as strong as @xmath19 km ( @xmath20 ev ) , considerably stronger than present solar system based bounds .",
    "the ibwd bound also has the advantage of not depending on the complicated details of black hole coalescences .",
    "section [ sec : ibwd ] reviews what is known about the interacting binary white dwarfs , in particular the helium cataclysmic variable ( hecv ) systems and their archetype , the binary am cvn ( am _ canum venaticorum _ ) .",
    "section [ sec : gmem ] reviews the basic notions associated with ( possibly ) massive photons and gravitons .",
    "sections [ sec : gravitonmass]@xmath21[sec : phasedelay ] propose a new experiment to measure the graviton mass using ibwd observations , and an expression for the mass is derived . in section [ sec : amcvn ] , the sensitivity predicted for lisa is used to estimate how precise a bound could be placed on the graviton mass from hecv observations .",
    "section [ sec : ending ] summarizes the results , and also suggests how correlation of phase measurements might be used to measure other astrophysical parameters in the binary system , such as the accretion disk radius .    throughout this paper , geometric units with @xmath22",
    "are employed , unless otherwise noted .",
    "estimates suggest the galaxy is populated by @xmath23 close binary star systems @xcite .",
    "the sheer numbers of these systems is likely to have profound consequences for space - based gravitational wave observatories .",
    "the combined gravitational waves from these binaries will produce a stochastic background which rises well above the low frequency detection sensitivity of lisa @xcite . particularly strong (",
    "_ e.g. _ , nearby ) binary systems will rise above this background and be observable by a spaceborne observatory .",
    "one class of such sources are the helium cataclysmic variable ( hecv ) stars .",
    "the properties of the six nearest known hecvs are shown in table [ binarytable ] @xcite .",
    "the predicted stochastic gravitational wave background due to short period binary stars , as calculated by hils and bender @xcite and the predicted signals of the six nearest hecvs are plotted in figure [ wdcurve ] , along with the predicted sensitivity curve of lisa .",
    "if present models of the spatial density of close binaries in the galaxy are correct , roughly 5000 of these sources should be individually detectable by a space - based laser interferometer such as lisa@xcite .",
    "currently the best models for hecvs describe a star system where the secondary star ( the lower mass companion in the binary system , usually a degenerate helium dwarf star ) has expanded to fill its roche lobe , and the primary star ( the larger mass , compact white dwarf ) lies at the core of an accretion disk .",
    "matter overflows from the secondary roche lobe and streams onto the accretion disk , creating a hot spot which emits a strong electromagnetic signal .",
    "there are several mechanisms whereby the light curve of an hecv could be modulated as seen from the perspective of observers on earth .",
    "the simplest model is for systems whose orbital plane is close to the line of sight to the earth , so that the stars periodically eclipse , partially or wholly .",
    "the eclipse phase could dim the stellar components , part of the primary emission regions of the accretion disk , or the roche lobe .",
    "another possible mechanism for variation in the light curve is associated with the emission from the secondary star , which has expanded to fill its roche lobe .",
    "the star will appear brighter when the largest surface area is presented to the observer along the projected line of sight .",
    "this will occur twice in each orbit , when the line of sight is perpendicular to the line of centers .",
    "signatures in the light curve due to projected area effects are called `` ellipsoidal variations , '' and are most easily observed in infrared wavelengths @xcite . yet another possible mechanism is currently favored to explain the source of variation in the light curve of the archetype system for hecvs , am cvn @xcite . in this model",
    "the hot spot on the accretion disk radiates approximately radially outward from the disk . as the binary orbits",
    ", this hot spot alternately turns towards and away from distant observers , leading to a modulation of the light curve ( a so - called `` flashlight '' mechanism ) .    a detailed theoretical model of am",
    "cvn has been constructed , describing a variety of signals which are present in the photometric data @xcite .",
    "this model suggests that am cvn is a member of a class of variable stars that have periodic features in the light curve known as `` superhumps '' @xcite .",
    "the model explains the superhump feature as being caused by the existence of an eccentric precessing accretion disk , with a precession period which is slightly longer than the orbital period of the binary . knowing the superhump period , @xmath24 , and the precessional period of the accretion disk ( apsidal advance ) , @xmath25",
    ", the model predicts the _",
    "orbital _ period will be given by @xmath26 photometry of am cvn shows the existence of a superhump signature at @xmath27 s , and the period of the accretion disk precession at @xmath28 hr .",
    "using eq.([periodtheory ] ) this model predicts a binary orbital period of @xmath29 s for am cvn @xcite .",
    "photometric observations by the cba have recently confirmed an orbital period of @xmath30 s @xcite .",
    "to constrain the mass of the graviton by comparing the propagation speed of gravitational and electromagnetic waves , one must consider how the speed of gravitational waves ( and electromagnetic waves ) is related to the mass of the graviton ( and the possible mass of the photon ) .    the current bound on the photon mass is @xmath31 ev @xcite , which is much larger than the current bounds on the graviton mass ( _ cf .",
    "_ , the solar system bound on the graviton mass is @xmath7 ev ) .",
    "is it then justifiable to treat the photon as a massless particle , while at the same time treating the graviton as a massive particle ?",
    "the resolution to this question can be understood by examining the partition of energy between the rest mass and kinetic energy of a particle being received from a distant binary . from the relativistic energy , @xmath32",
    ", one may write the velocity of any particle as @xmath33 if @xmath34 , then eq .  ( [ relvelocity ] ) implies @xmath35 where @xmath36 parameterizes the difference between the velocity of the particle and @xmath37 .    for optical photons",

    "for this energy , @xmath40 .",
    "similar considerations may be applied to the gravitons received from the same binary systems . in this case , the frequency of the gravitational waves is @xmath41 hz , giving a characteristic energy for a single graviton of @xmath42 ev . using the solar system bound on the graviton mass , @xmath7 ev , yields @xmath43 .    for the current bounds on the photon and graviton masses ,",
    "if the bound on the mass of the graviton is not drastically improved ( _ e.g. _ , decreasing the bound on @xmath5 by @xmath45 orders of magnitude , such that @xmath46 ) , then the effect of a non - zero mass will be much more significant for gravitons than photons in our analysis .",
    "this justifies the treatment of the photons as massless particles and the gravitons as massive particles in this paper .",
    "since the gravitational waves emitted by an hecv binary star system are essentially monochromatic , they will have a single particular velocity , @xmath47 writing the energy in eq .",
    "( [ vgraviton ] ) as @xmath48 , and identifying the compton wavelength of the graviton as @xmath4 this becomes @xmath49",
    "as noted in section [ sec : ibwd ] , it is expected that the galaxy harbors a large population of interacting binary white dwarf stars .",
    "the light curves for several of these systems are already known , obtained from ground - based optical photometry . because these systems are expected to be observable in the gravitational wave spectrum ( in addition to the optical spectrum ) , they present an excellent opportunity to directly compare the propagation speed of electromagnetic and gravitational waves .",
    "consider the schematic diagram shown in figure [ binaryidea ] .",
    "the phase fronts of the light curve modulation are represented in the top half of the diagram .",
    "the binary star system will also emit gravitational radiation which could be monitored by earth - bound observers as well .",
    "the phase fronts of the gravitational wave signal are represented in the lower half of the diagram .",
    "suppose the two signals are emitted in phase at the source as shown .",
    "if the graviton is a massive particle , then the gravitational waves propagate at a speed @xmath50 , and the gravitational phase fronts will _ lag _ behind the light curve phase fronts when the signals arrive at earth , as shown . by measuring the lag between the phase fronts ,",
    "the mass of the graviton can be measured or bounded .    to determine the lag between the two signals , the phase of each signal must be measured .",
    "consider a binary with orbital frequency @xmath51 at a distance @xmath52 from earth .",
    "assuming the photon to be massless ( @xmath53 ) , the observed phase of the light curve will be @xmath54 where the term @xmath55 represents a variety of effects ( discussed in section [ sec : phasedelay ] ) which could create phase delays between the electromagnetic and gravitational signals that are being monitored .",
    "in contrast , the gravitational wave signal , traveling at @xmath50 will arrive at earth with a phase of @xmath56    the phase lag , @xmath57 , between the light curve and gravitational wave signals is constructed from these two phases : @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the factor of @xmath60 insures that the phase subtraction is done between two signals with the _ same _ frequency .",
    "it is convenient to define the fractional change in the phase as @xmath61    taking the definition of @xmath62 from eq .",

    "one can eliminate this concern because strong bounds on the graviton mass already exist .",
    "the largest observable phase shift which is consistent with current bounds can be computed by simply evaluating eq.([comptonwavelength ] ) with @xmath66 equal to the bound of interest .",
    "for example , the bound on the graviton mass given by solar system constraints , applied to the am cvn system , yields a maximum fractional phase change of @xmath67 .",

    "in order to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ comptonwavelength ] ) , one must not only measure the phase lag between the two signals , but an estimate must be made for the value of @xmath73 .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 can be written as the sum of two primary sources of delay between the gravitational and electromagnetic signal phases : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a phase lag associated with the wave s propagation from the binary to the observer at the earth and @xmath76 is a phase lag which depends on the specific astrophysical nature of the binary star system .    in principle",

    ".    for cases when @xmath76 can not be accurately determined , the dependence of the compton wavelength of the graviton on this parameter ( or on @xmath75 ) can be eliminated by subtraction of two observations of the source .",
