    "a quite common method for the transportation of granular media is pneumatic conveying , where grains are driven through pipes by air flow .",
    "practical applications for pneumatic conveying can be found in food industry and in civil and chemical engineering .",
    "one distinguishes two modes of pneumatic conveying : dilute and dense phase conveying .",
    "dilute phase conveying has been studied in much detail  @xcite and is well understood .",
    "the grains are dispersed and dragged individually by the gas flow and the interaction between grains is small .",
    "this is not true for the dense phase conveying , where the particle interaction is important and where particle density waves can be observed .",
    "two modes of dense phase conveying can be distinguished , depending on the orientation of the pipe transporting the grains . in the horizontal transport",
    "the granular medium separates into two layers , the moving bed at the bottom of the pipe and the irregular transport by traveling dunes or slugs  @xcite . in the vertical transport the granular medium forms strands at medium gas velocities  @xcite and plugs at low gas velocities with high mass loads  @xcite ; this mode is called plug conveying .",
    "currently plug conveying is gaining importance in industry , because it causes a lower product degradation and pipeline erosion than dilute phase conveying .",
    "unfortunately , current models  @xcite of plug conveying disagree even on the prediction of such basic quantities as the pressure drop and the total mass flow , and these quantities have a great impact in the industrial application .",
    "one of the reasons for the lack of valid models is that it is difficult to study plugs experimentally in a detailed way .",
    "usually experimental setups are limited to the measurement of the local pressure drop , the total mass flux and the velocity of plugs .",
    "most promising experimental studies have been performed by electrical capacity tomography  @xcite and stress detectors  @xcite .",
    "simulational studies are handicapped by the high computational cost for solving the gas flow and the particle - particle interaction , and are therefore mostly limited to two dimensions .",
    "for the dense phase regime simulations have been done for bubbling fluidized beds  @xcite , which show for high gas velocities first signs of pneumatic transport  @xcite , for the strand type of conveying  @xcite , and slugs in horizontal transport  @xcite .",
    "simulations of vertical transport which show plugs with considerable length are rare .",
    "there is only one simulation of a short pipe in two dimensions by tsuji et al .",
    "@xcite and a picture of a single plug from a simulation with 50 particles in three dimensions by ichiki et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a detailed view of plugs , by using a discrete element simulation combined with a solver for the pressure drop .",
    "this approach provides access to important parameters like the porosity and velocity of the granulate and the shear stress on the wall at relatively low computational cost .",
    "contrary to the experiments , it is possible to access these parameters at high spatial resolution and without influencing the process of transportation at all . additionally to plug profiles ,",
    "characteristic curves of the pressure drop and the influence of simulation parameters are measured .",
    "the simulation results are compared with and verified by experiments .",
    "plug conveying is a special case of the two phase flow of grains and gas .",
    "it is therefore necessary to calculate the motion of both phases , as well as the interaction between them . in the following ,",
    "we explain how our algorithm treats each of these problems .      the model for the gas simulation",
    "was first introduced by mcnamara and flekky @xcite and has been implemented for the two dimensional case to simulate the rising of bubbles within a fluidized bed . for the simulation of plug conveying we developed a three dimensional version of this algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is based on the mass conservation of the gas and the granular medium .",
    "conservation of grains implies that the density @xmath0 of the granular medium obeys @xmath1 where the specific density of the particle material is @xmath2 , the porosity of the medium is @xmath3 ( i.e. the fraction of the space available to the gas ) , and the velocity of the granulate is @xmath4 .",
    "the mass conservation equation for the gas is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density of the gas and @xmath7 its velocity .",
    "this equation can be transformed into a differential equation for the gas pressure @xmath8 using the ideal gas equation , together with the assumption of uniform temperature .",
    "the velocity @xmath7 of the gas is related to the granulate velocity @xmath4 through the darcy relation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dynamic viscosity of the air and @xmath11 is the permeability of the granular medium .",
    "this relation was first given by darcy in 1856 @xcite .",
    "for the permeability @xmath11 the carman - kozeny relation @xcite was chosen , which provides a relation between the porosity @xmath3 , the particle diameter @xmath12 and the permeability of a granular medium of monodisperse spheres , @xmath13 after linearizing around the normal atmospheric pressure @xmath14 the resulting differential equation only depends on the relative pressure @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , the porosity @xmath3 and the granular velocity @xmath4 , which can by derived from the particle simulation , and some constants like the viscosity  @xmath10 : @xmath17 this differential equation can be interpreted as a diffusion equation with a diffusion constant @xmath18 .",
    "the equation is solved numerically , using a crank - nickelson approach for the discretization .",
    "each dimension is integrated separately .",
    "the boundary conditions are imposed by adding a term @xmath19 on the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn : dgl ] ) at the top and the bottom of the tube , where @xmath20 .",
    "this resembles a constant gas flux with velocity @xmath21 at a pressure @xmath14 into and out of the tube .",
    "the model for the granular medium simulates each grain individually using a discrete element simulation ( des ) . for the implementation of the discrete element simulation we used a version of the molecular dynamics method described by cundall  @xcite.the particles",
    "are approximated as monodisperse spheres , rotations in three dimensions are taken into account .",
    "the equation of motion for an individual particle is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of a particle , @xmath24 the gravitation constant and @xmath25 the sum over all contact forces .",
    "the last term , the drag force , is assumed to be a volume force given by the pressure drop @xmath26 and the local mass density of the granular medium @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction between two particles in contact is given by two force components : a normal and a tangential component with respect to the particle surface .",
    "the normal force is the sum of a repulsive elastic force ( hooke s law ) and a viscous damping .",
    "the tangential force is proportional to the normal force ( sliding coulomb friction ) or a viscous damping .",
    "the viscous damping is used when the relative surface velocity of the particles in contact is small .",
    "the same force laws are considered for the interaction between particles and the tube wall .",
    "the simulation method uses both a continuum and a discrete element approach .",
