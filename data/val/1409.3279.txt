    "an increasing interest in short x - ray pulses requires short electron bunches in storage rings . over the years",
    ", the traditional way to get short bunches is to decrease the momentum compaction factor by low-@xmath0 optics @xcite .",
    "however , the average current per bunch will decrease to the order of @xmath1a magnitude with low-@xmath0 , limited by beam instability and microbunching due to coherent synchrotron radiation and other collective effects @xcite .",
    "bessy ii presented an idea to produce long and short bunches alternatively in their storage ring : with two superconducting cavities , 3rd harmonic and 3.5th harmonic of the fundamental rf cavity , the voltage gradient produced by two sc - cavities could add up at even points for bunches focusing to get short bunches , and cancel each other at odd points to get long bunches @xcite .",
    "the new method greatly improved the capacity of storing current in the ring .",
    "nonetheless , bessy ii is filled with 400 buckets , which is the multiples of 2 , leading to the result of choose the second sc - cavity as a 1/2 times higher harmonic one .",
    "what if the ring is with odd buckets , such as multiples of 3 , 5 , 7 ? in this paper , we find the problem could be solved by choosing the frequency of the second sc - cavity ( sub harmonic cavity ) in a different way .",
    "for a ring , whose minimum common factor is @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , the frequency of the sub harmonic cavity could be chosen @xmath4 times higher than harmonic one .",
    "several typical situations are listed in table.[tab : cavity harmonic number ] , in which @xmath5 is chosen accord to the voltage and frequency of original cavity in different rings .",
    ".[tab : cavity harmonic number]harmonic number with different buckets number [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "a scheme is presented to operate the hls ii ring with simultaneous medium , long and short bunches .",
    "the short bunches current limit can be increased more than 60 times compared to low-@xmath0 mode .",
    "the frequencies of two superconducting cavities are both near 1.3 ghz , which are easy to achieve by tuning , for 1.3 ghz is a common frequency for sc - cavities @xcite . and the voltages are about 2 mv , which is easy to be realized by single - cell or two - cell structure , so the hom problems will be simplified .",
