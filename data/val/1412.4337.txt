    "quantum walks ( qws ) were introduced in the litterature by y. aharonov @xcite and d. a. meyer @xcite .",
    "they are models of coherent quantum transport in discrete space .",
    "this article focuses on discrete - time quantum walks ( dtqws ) , which are quantum formal analogues to classical random walks ( crws ) .",
    "a typical @xmath1 quantum walker carries a two - state internal degree of freedom or spin . at each time",
    "- step of a dtqw , the spin of the walker is rotated deterministically through a so - called coin operator and the walker then undergoes a spin - dependent position shift to the left or to the right .",
    "this evolution naturally entangles the spin and the position of the walker .",
    "the basic construction just outlined has been generalized to higher spatial dimensions and/or coin spaces of dimension higher than two @xcite .",
    "two standard reviews on ( dt)qws are @xcite .",
    "dtqws have been realized experimentally with a wide range of physical objects and setups @xcite .",
    "they are important in a large variety of contexts , ranging from fundamental quantum physics @xcite to quantum algorithmics @xcite , solid state physics @xcite and biophysics @xcite .",
    "contrary to crws , dtqws are actually deterministic .",
    "indeed , while crws describe diffusion , dtqws describe wave propagation at finite velocity .",
    "dtqws are therefore linked with lorentz geometry @xcite and in particular with the dirac equation .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that several families of @xmath1 dtqws could be interpreted as discrete models of spin 1/2 dirac fermions coupled to electric and relativistic gravitational fields .",
    "the aim of this article is to extend these results to magnetic fields .",
    "we thus introduce a new family of @xmath0 dtqws and show that the formal continuous limit of this family coincides with the dirac dynamics of a spin 1/2 fermion coupled to a constant and homogeneous magnetic field orthogonal to the @xmath0 space in which the walk propagates .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian generating this continuous dynamics are well - known and are called the relativistic landau levels .",
    "we show by a perturbative computation that landau levels also exist for the discrete dynamics of the dtqws and discuss how the corresponding eigenstates and probability densities are influenced by the finite non - vanishing time- and position - step .",
    "all results are finally supported by numerical simulations .",
    "the results presented in this article strongly support that dtqws can be used for quantum simulation of condensed - matter systems and spintronics . indeed ,",
    "much of the recent research on condensed - matter physics involves the @xmath0 interaction of electrons with magnetic fields .",
    "landau levels play a prominent role in this field and are for example one of the key ingredients of the quantum hall effect @xcite , which has current important applications in metrology @xcite , and could also be used in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "thus , the existence of landau levels for the dtqws make dtqws natural promising candidates for quantum simulation of many interesting phenomena , including the quantum hall effect .",

    "the time is @xmath184 , the mass is equal to unity and the magnetic field vanishes . as @xmath174 increases , the interference patterns gets more and more circular , and the presence of the underlying lattice becomes less and less noticeable .",
    "we have constructed a family of @xmath0 dtqws which admits as continuous limit the standard dirac dynamics of a relativistic spin 1/2 fermion coupled to a constant and uniform magnetic field .",
    "we have then shown pertubatively that landau levels exist for this family , not only in the continuous limit , but also for finite non - vanishing values of the time- and position - step .",
    "we have finally presented numerical simulations which ( i ) support the existence of landau levels for the dtqws ( ii ) suggest that the magnetic interpretation of the discrete dynamics is still valid even outside the continuous limit .",
    "let us now discuss the results presented in this article .",
    "the family of @xmath0 dtqws considered in this work lives in a two - dimensional hilbert space _",
    "i.e. _ the wave function of the walk has two components .",
    "this is consistent with standard spinor theory , because irreducible representations of the clifford algebra in @xmath53 dimensional space - times are indeed two - component spinors . to explore the full @xmath0 lattice , each walk in the family alternates between time - steps in which it propagates in the @xmath67-direction and time - steps in which it propagates in the @xmath73-direction .",
    "a general walk exploring the @xmath0 lattice in this way is defined by two @xmath191 matrices belonging to @xmath192 and a phase .",
    "each of the two matrices is caracterized by three euler angles .",
    "thus , a general @xmath0 dtqw with two components is defined by seven real parameters ( angles ) , which generally depend on time and space . for the record , a general @xmath1 dtqw with two components",
    "is defined by an arbitray time- and space - dependent matrix in @xmath192 and a phase _",
    "i.e. _ by four time- and space - dependent parameters ( angles ) .",
    "previous investigations of @xmath1 dtqws coupled to artificial electric fields teach that the mass of the walk is encoded in the ` @xmath193 ' euler angle and that electric fields are encoded in the phase parameter and in one of the remaining two euler angles .",
    "this experience has been used in constructing the dtqws studied in this article .    building the family ( [ eq : fund ] ) of dtqws also required a choice of gauge .",
    "we have chosen to work in a gauge where the vector potential depends only on one cartesian coordinate ( @xmath67 ) , because this makes it possible to use fourier transforms with respect to the other cartesian coordinate ( @xmath73 ) , which facilitates the computation of landau levels .",
    "all numerical computations have been carried out in @xmath194-space , where @xmath79 is the wave number associated to @xmath73 . in particular , no fourier transform with respect to @xmath67 has been used .",
    "generally speaking , all results pertaining to the continuous limits of dtqws can be envisaged from two different points of view .",
    "the first one consists in viewing the dtqws as discrete schemes approximating partial differential equations .",
    "the second one consists in viewing the dtqws as physical systems in their own right , and to consider their continuous limits as tools allowing a greater insight into a fundamentally discrete dynamics .",
    "this second point of view appears especially natural in the context of quantum algorithmics , and it has been strengthened by the existence of recent laboratory experiments on dtqws .",
    "this is the point of view we have adopted in the present article .",
    "let us nevertheless discuss rapidly our results from the first point of view .",
    "the dirac equation is notoriously difficult to discretize @xcite .",
    "naive symmetric discretizations suffer from the so - called fermion - doubling phenomenon @xcite .",
    "other methods are based on the wilson @xcite or staggered @xcite fermion discretizations , but they break chiral symmetry and they also exhibit instabilities and spurious diffusive behaviour . a particularly efficient method has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the dtqws defined by ( [ eq : fund2 ] ) are symmetric discretization . as such",
    ", they do exhibit fermion doubling , and this can be checked for example by a direct examination of the dispersion relation associated to ( [ eq : fund2 ] ) .",
    "thus , dtqws are not the best tool to compute accurately numerical solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "this however does not invalidate the use of dtqws as quantum simulators of condensed - matter physics . indeed , as already discussed in section [ section : continuous_limit ] , the dirac equation is used in condensed matter only as an effective description of small wave number excitations and the description of excitations in terms of dirac fermions moving in continuous space certainly becomes invalid at wave numbers comparable to the size of the brillouin zone of the material , where the excitations ` see ' the size of the underlying lattice . for small wave numbers",
    ", the dtqws do reproduce the dirac equation . because of fermion doubling , the dtqws do _ not _ reproduce the dirac equation for wave numbers comparable to the size of the brillouin zone but for these wave numbers , the dirac equation is not physically realistic anyway .",
    "thus , fermion doubling does not preclude the use of dtqws as quantum simulators of small wave number excitation transport in condensed matter .",
    "moreover , since dtqws are based on a lattice , they are probably the best tool to model , in graphene - like materials , the transport of excitations with wave numbers comparable to the size of the brillouin zone , which ` see ' the underlying lattice @xcite .",
    "let us finally refer to @xcite for an in - depth presentation of the links existing between qws , the dirac equation and the quantum lattice boltzmann model .",
    "a final , rather technical remark is in order . obtaining the dirac equation ( [ eq : dirac ] ) as the continuous limit of the dtqw considered in this article requires two very different ingredients .",
    "the first one is the identification of the indices @xmath9 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 with integers labelling points on a regular cartesian lattice in space - time .",
    "the second ingredient is the choice of the same step @xmath43 for all three space - time directions .",
    "both ingredients are non trivial and changing them could prove useful in certain contexts .",
    "for example , choosing the integers @xmath9 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 as labels of arbitrary , non necessarily cartesian coordinates could be useful to study dtqws on manifolds . and",
    "having different steps for the different coordinates could help studying solutions of the dtqws with different variation scales in the time and/or in the two spatial directions .",
    "the conclusions presented in this article are an extension of previous results which show that several families of @xmath1 dtqws can be interpreted as dirac spin 1/2 fermions coupled to arbitrary non - constant and non - homogeneous electric and gravitational fields .",
    "preliminary computations show that the family considered in this article can be extended into a larger family where the @xmath0 quantum walker can be coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields as well as general relativistic gravitational fields .",
    "this extension will be presented elsewhere .",
    "even larger extensions which include other gauge fields should be investigated too .",
    "note that @xmath1 and @xmath0 dtqws based on four - component wave functions have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the connection of these alternate walks to relativistic fermions coupled to electromagnetic fields certainly deserves exploring .",
    "finally , the above results strongly suggest that dtqws can be used for spintronics and for quantum simulation of condensed - matter systems under magnetic fields , including possible simulations of the quantum hall effect .",
    "the first step in searching for the relativistic landau levels is to search for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath195 in basis @xmath196 , because this operator is diagonal in that basis .",
    "from ( [ eq : hamiltonian_form_tf_final ] ) , one is thus led to solving the system @xmath197 where @xmath198 are the two components of some eigenfunction of @xmath199 in basis @xmath196 , @xmath200 is the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath201 and @xmath202    suppose first that both @xmath203 and @xmath204 do not vanish identically .",
    "equations ( [ oh_eq_1 ] ) then imply @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 is the normalized @xmath123-th @xmath1 harmonic oscillator energy eigenstate , which reads @xmath208 equations ( [ eq : relativistic_energies ] ) lead to @xmath209 . the eigenvectors of @xmath201 are thus of the form @xmath210 = \\left (    \\begin{array}{c }    \\alpha \\ \\phi^{ho}_{n-1}(x - \\chi(k , b))\\\\    \\beta \\ \\phi^{ho}_{n}(x - \\chi(k , b ) )    \\end{array } \\right ) \\\\ \\label{eigenstate_2 } &   b < 0 \\ \\mathbf { : } \\ \\ \\ \\   [ ( \\pi_{n}^{b<0})^u(x , k ) ] =   \\left (    \\begin{array}{c }    \\beta \\ \\phi^{ho}_{n}(x - \\chi(k , b))\\\\    \\alpha \\ \\phi^{ho}_{n-1}(x - \\chi(k , b ) )    \\end{array } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath37 , @xmath213 are two complex numbers obeying @xmath214 ( normalized eigenvectors )",
    ".    the squared hamiltonian @xmath201 also admits eigenvectors with one identically vanishing spin component in basis @xmath196 . for these eigenvectors ,",
    "equations ( [ oh_eq_1 ] ) degenerate into a single equation . the non - vanishing spin component ,",
    "say @xmath203 ( _ resp .",
    "_ @xmath204 ) is then identical to an arbitrary eigenfunction @xmath215 of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian and the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath201 is @xmath216 ( _ resp . _",
    "@xmath217 ) .",
    "any normalized eigenfunction of the hamiltonian @xmath105 is also a normalized eigenfunction of its square and is thus one of the functions determined above .",
    "the discrimination between the functions that are actual eigenfunctions of @xmath105 and those which are not is best made by computing directly the action of the hamiltonian @xmath105 on all eigenfunctions of @xmath201 .",
    "one thus finds the ground - state energy @xmath218 and the corresponding normalized eigenfunction @xmath219 , which has an identically vanishing spin component .",
    "the other eigenstates are labelled by an integer @xmath220 and a sign @xmath221 .",
    "the eigenvalues are + @xmath222 and the normalized eigenstates , that we note @xmath223 , are of the form ( [ eigenstate_1 ] ) , ( [ eigenstate_2 ] ) with @xmath224",
    "as seen in appendix a , the eigen - elements of @xmath225 are labelled by @xmath226 , with @xmath109 and @xmath220 . , which can be considered as a parameter in our problem .",
    "indeed , this quantum number @xmath79 corresponds to an essential degeneracy of the full hamiltonian of the dtqw , namely @xmath227 ; this degeneracy will hence not be removed by our perturbative computation . ]",
    "we now apply perturbation theory for the hamiltonian @xmath228 . to lighten notations ,",
    "we define @xmath229 at first order in @xmath43 , the eigenstates of @xmath227 can be written @xmath230 , with : @xmath231 having made the standard phase choice that @xmath232 is orthogonal to @xmath233 .",
