    "in the present , within the standard model ( henceforth sm ) the most of present high energy physics experiments can be explained relatively well",
    ". however , many phenomenas are still unexplained , e.g. fermion mass problem , @xmath4 violation , strong _ cp _ problem , electric dipole moment and so on . in order to explain them ,",
    "many models beyond the sm are proposed ( refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "especially , in the sense of the existence of tree - level flavor changing neutral current ( henceforth called fcnc ) , one can divide them into two types , i.e.    1 .",
    "models with tree - level fcnc ( vector - like quark model , etc . ) .",
    "models without tree - level fcnc ( some two higgs doublet model , etc . ) .    in the sm",
    ", fcnc occurs only in the one loop and higher orders , but does not emerge in the tree - level .",
    "the existence of fcnc s in the sm have consequences in the rare decays of mesons , e.g. @xmath5 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "as will be reviewed shortly in the first section , these rare decays have an important role to investigate the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( henceforth called ckm matrix ) .",
    "the study of ckm matrix will lead us to have a better understanding about yukawa sector in the sm , as well as new physics in the beyond sm . so",

    "according to the processes , we discuss some experimental constraints on the unitarity of ckm matrix .",

    "the upper - bounds for @xmath10 will be found from the @xmath5 and @xmath2 mesons processes , under an assumption that the tree - level fcnc s are dominant .",
    "further we evaluate the constraints for two cases ,    1 .",
    "constraint when the unitarity is nearly conserved .",
    "constraint when the unitarity is violated and the quadrangle is conserved .    in the case",
    "( 1 ) , small fcnc is allowed from the evaluation of the experimental bounds of @xmath11 mixing and the @xmath4 violation in the neutral @xmath5 meson . on the other hand ,",
    "large fcnc is allowed in the case ( 2 ) . under the bounds for each case ,",
    "the predictions for the neutral @xmath2 meson processes will be presented .",
    "the predictions for @xmath7 and @xmath4 asymmetries in the neutral @xmath2 meson system show that significant contributions are expected in the model , although the fcnc is small . for large fcnc",
    ", a significant contribution is expected in the inclusive @xmath9 decay . additionally , we also confirm contribution of the new physics due to the vqm in the electroweak oblique correction parameters , @xmath12 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and find that the contributions are negligible .",
    "apart from the experimental constraints , we will also present theoretical studies on the fcnc s , as a consequence of the behaviour of the mass matrices in the model .",
