    "surface models for membranes and strings constructed by helfrich and polyakov are described using the notion of two - dimensional differential geometry @xcite . the surface shape in @xmath0 is considered to be governed by a curvature hamiltonian , which is given by an integral over the squared mean curvature or the extrinsic curvature .",
    "consequently , the surface strength is characterized by bending rigidity @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , we understand that the surface collapses and wrinkles in the limit of @xmath2 while it swells and becomes smooth in the limit of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies utilizing the renormalization group technique predict that the crumpling transition is continuous @xcite , while density - matrix renormalization group studies on the folding of triangular lattice @xcite and recent numerical simulations of the model on triangulated surfaces @xcite indicate that the crumpling transition is of the first - order and accompanies the collapsing transition .    by including certain inhomogeneous components such as cytoskeletal structure or holes in the above - mentioned homogeneous models , we obtain a variety of surface models for numerical studies @xcite .",
    "lateral diffusion of lipids can also be implemented in the models by the so - called dynamical triangulation technique , which introduces non - uniform coordination numbers @xmath4 to the triangulated surfaces @xcite .",
    "we should note that such non - uniform @xmath4 naturally appears in diagrammatic expansions of the matrix integral in the matrix model of @xmath5 quantum gravity , where the surface is embedded in the @xmath6 dimensional space , or equivalently it is not embedded in any external spaces @xcite .    in those inhomogeneous surface models in @xmath0 , the transitions separating two neighboring phases are discontinuous @xcite .",
    "thus , the first - order nature of transitions seems to be a common feature of the shape transformation transitions in the triangulated surface models .",
    "therefore , careful numerical studies are still needed to understand the phase structure of surface models , because first - order transitions are not always easy to analyze numerically .    in this paper , we study conventional homogeneous surface models on triangulated fixed - connectivity surfaces of sphere topology using the flat histogram monte carlo ( fhmc ) simulation technique of wang and landau @xcite .",
    "the surfaces are allowed to self - intersect .",
    "they are called phantom , or self - intersecting , surfaces .    the transitions of homogeneous surface models are already reported to be of the first - order .",
    "they were obtained using the canonical metropolis monte carlo ( mmc ) simulation technique , as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "mmc is a simple and reliable technique for studying phase transitions in all statistical mechanical systems .",
    "however , mmc is not always an efficient technique for analyzing first - order transitions .",
    "the curvature energy of surface models jumps at the first - order transition point .",
    "consequently , the surface configuration can be trapped in one of the minimum energy states if the lattice size increases .",
    "the configurations are trapped because mmc is directly defined based on a canonical ensemble , where the configuration of dynamical variables are generated by the boltzmann weight , which confines the configurations to a narrow energy range .",
    "in contrast to mmc , fhmc is defined by a random walk in energy space .",
    "a large number of studies have been conducted to verify that fhmc is an efficient and reliable technique for phase transitions in spin models @xcite .",
    "fhmc technique can also be applied to models of polymer chains , in which the phase space is non - compact @xcite , and also to models with more than two energy terms @xcite .",
    "the non - compactness of phase space and the multiple energy terms in those models share the common property with the surface models .",
    "in fact , the phase space of surface models is @xmath0 , which is non - compact and is in sharp contrast to the compact phase space of spin models .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian of surface models is always composed of two energy terms : the linear combination of a bond potential @xmath7 and a bending energy @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is nontrivial whether such a sophisticated technique is useful for studying phase transitions in surface models .",
    "in fact , a large scale simulation is necessary to study phase transitions of surface models , while fhmc technique is considered to be problematic on large systems of a spin model @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is two - fold . the first part aims to determine whether fmhc technique can be successfully applied to first - order transitions of surface models .",
    "the second purpose is to confirm that the conventional , homogeneous models undergo the first - order transition , which was first assessed by mmc simulation as mentioned above .",
    "the density of energy @xmath9 depends on two independent energies , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , such that @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we must replace @xmath11 by the single energy density @xmath12 , because it seems difficult to obtain @xmath11 due to the lack of computational speed currently available .",
    "thus , we should check whether this replacement is well defined or not .",
    "the models are defined by the partition function @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the total number of vertices and @xmath15 is the hamiltonian . the symbol @xmath16 denotes @xmath17-dimensional integration in @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath18 indicates that the integrations are performed such that the surface center is fixed to remove the translational zero mode .",
    "the self - avoiding property of the surface is not assumed .",
    "spherical surfaces in @xmath0 are triangulated , and @xmath15 is defined on them .",
    "the triangulated surfaces are constructed from the icosahedron by splitting the edges into @xmath19 pieces of uniform length and dividing the faces into triangles accordingly .",
    "the surfaces are identical to those used in @xcite . the total number of vertices is thus given by @xmath20 . the total number of bonds @xmath21 and the total number of triangles @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the coordination number @xmath4 is @xmath25 throughout the lattice except at @xmath26 vertices , which are the vertices of the icosahedron and of @xmath27 .    the first model denoted by _ model 1 _ is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath15 , which is the linear combination of the gaussian bond potential @xmath7 and the bending energy @xmath8 with the bending rigidity @xmath1 : @xmath28 @xmath29 in @xmath7 denotes the sum over bond @xmath30 connecting the vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 in @xmath8 is the sum over triangles @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which share a common bond . the symbol @xmath34 in @xmath7 is the bond length squares between the vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the symbol @xmath35 in @xmath8 denotes a unit normal vector of the triangle @xmath31 .",
    "the inner product of the normal vectors @xmath36 can also be represented by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the edge angle between two triangles .",
    "the unit of @xmath1 is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath41 is the temperature .    the second model denoted by _ model 2 _ is defined by the linear combination of a hard wall potential @xmath42 and the bending energy @xmath8 with the bending rigidity @xmath1 such that @xmath43 where @xmath42 denotes that the potential depends on the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the symbol @xmath45 in @xmath42 is the potential between the vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 and is defined by @xmath46 the value of @xmath44 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) is fixed at @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath48 , which is automatically satisfied in model 1 as described below , where the gaussian bond potential @xmath49 is included in the hamiltonian in place of the hard - wall potential @xmath42 .    the hard wall potential @xmath42 makes the mean bond length constant just like the gaussian bond potential @xmath7 , which makes the mean bond length constant in model 1 . if it were not for the constraint @xmath50 , the size of the surface would grow larger and larger in the mc simulations .",
    "thus the constraint @xmath50 is necessary to make the bond length well - defined if the gaussian term @xmath7 is not included in the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , model 2 has an additional parameter , @xmath44 , which seems to fix a length scale in the model .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the results are not dependent on @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath47 in the mc simulations .",
    "we should note that @xmath51 is satisfied in model 1 .",
    "this is understood from the scale invariant property of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "in fact , by rescaling the integration variable in @xmath52 such that @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 .",
    "the scale invariance of @xmath52 indicates that @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 and , therefore , is represented by @xmath58 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath59 . in contrast , @xmath51 is not satisfied in model 2 because the partition function @xmath52 is not scale invariant in this case .",
    "in fact , the scale transformation @xmath53 non - trivially changes the potential @xmath42 because @xmath44 also changes .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 is not always satisfied .",
    "however , @xmath51 is almost satisfied in model 2 as we will see below .",
    "this finding implies that the violation of the scale invariance is not very large in model 2 .",
    "@xmath15 in eq .",

    "can also be written as @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the partition function @xmath52 is unchanged by rescaling @xmath65 , while this rescaling changes @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we can use this simple expression as the hamiltonian , where we should always remind ourselves that the coefficient of @xmath7 is assumed to be @xmath68\\!=\\!1 $ ] .",
    "we first describe the histogram technique for model 1 using the terminologies described in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the phase space of the models is @xmath0 , and the dynamical variables @xmath69 are continuous .",
    "consequently , the energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the models are continuous in contrast to the energy of the ising spin model . for this reason ,",
    "the number of states @xmath70 at energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 should be understood with the symbol @xmath71 , such that @xmath72 .",

    "we then obtain @xmath77 $ ] . using this",
    ", we have the expectation value of a physical quantity @xmath78 at @xmath1 such that @xmath79 this expression is a basic formula for reweighting called a single histogram technique , which allows us to obtain @xmath80 from the monte carlo data @xmath75 at @xmath81 .",
    "the reweighting technique described above has two tasks .",
    "the first is to obtain @xmath70 , and the second is to obtain the canonical expectation value by reweighting .",
    "the problem lies is performing the first task or obtaining @xmath70 efficiently .",
    "it is well known that the mmc technique is less efficient for evaluating @xmath82 in a large system because of the exponential dumping of @xmath9 in the energy space .",
    "the multicanonical monte carlo simulation ( mcmc ) technique is considered a dynamic version of the multihistogram reweighting technique @xcite .",
    "however , it is not apparent whether this technique is applicable to the simulations of large surfaces .",
    "in fact , our preliminary study indicates that a flat histogram is barely obtained by mcmc simulations on the surfaces of @xmath83 for model 1 . by contrast",
    ", a flat histogram can be obtained even on relatively large surfaces by the flat - histogram mc technique , which was recently proposed by wang and landau .",
    "detailed information on the fhmc technique for surface simulation is described in the following subsection .",
    "the wang - landau fhmc technique for surface models , which is simply denoted as fhmc , consists of the following three steps @xcite :    1 .",
    "recursive construction of @xmath84 .",
    "a production run with @xmath84 , collecting measurements .",
    "3 .   reweighting to extract the canonical expectation of physical quantities .",
    "the first and the second steps are long monte carlo runs , but the third step is very short by comparison . the second run ( = step 2 ) includes thermalization monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) . in the following ,",
    "we describe each step in detail .    in fhmc simulations for model 1 and model 2 , we use a reduced density of states @xmath84 , which is obtained by the replacement @xmath85",
    "this replacement is necessary because @xmath70 is a double histogram and , hence , seems very hard to obtain accurately .",
    "this replacement is also well defined if we recall that @xmath7 is almost constant in model 1 due to the scale invariance of the partition function .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 is almost constant implies that the role of @xmath7 is to make the mean bond length constant in model 1 .",
    "therefore , the potential @xmath7 can be replaced by a lennard - jones type potential @xcite or by a hard - wall potential , which is the potential in model 2 .",
    "thus , the phase structure of the surface models is primarily dependent on the curvature energy @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , the replacement in eq .",
    "( [ replace_omega ] ) is considered as reasonable .",
    "the histogram @xmath12 is defined by @xmath8 in the region @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are chosen such that the phase transition region is included .",
    "we should note that @xmath12 implicitly depends on @xmath7 in model 1 and on @xmath42 in model 2 , although the replacement of eq .",
    "( [ replace_omega ] ) is assumed .",
    "in step 1 , @xmath84 is recursively obtained by updating the variables @xmath89 as follows : the new position @xmath90 of the vertex @xmath31 is given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is chosen randomly in a small sphere .",

    "therefore , the phase transition in model 2 is considered to be accompanied by a structural change of its surface , although the discontinuity is very small compared to the value of @xmath166 .",
    "the fact that the discontinuity in @xmath166 is very small compared to @xmath166 itself indicates that the violation of scale invariance is small in model 2 , as mentioned in section 2 .",
    "in this paper , we studied two types of triangulated spherical surface models using the flat histogram monte carlo ( fhmc ) simulation technique of wang and landau .",
    "the surface models have long been studied numerically , mainly using metropolis monte carlo ( mmc ) simulations .",
    "it has been recently reported that the surface fluctuations in these models undergo a first - order transition .",
    "we aimed to confirm that the transition is of the first order and to verify that the fhmc technique can be applied to study phase transitions of surface models .",
    "it is nontrivial whether fhmc can be used to study surface models because large - scale simulations are necessary to study the phase structure of surfaces .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the fhmc technique can not always be successfully applied to large - scale simulations of spin models . on the other hand ,",
    "the variables @xmath89 of the surface models are updated by a random walk in energy space in the fhmc technique .",
    "therefore , the fhmc technique is considered to have an advantage in studying first - order phase transitions , as compared to the mmc technique .",
    "however , the surface simulations by fhmc remained to be studied .",
    "the fhmc simulations performed in this paper consist of three steps : the first is a random walk in energy space to obtain the density of states @xmath12 recursively .",
    "the second is to collect measurements using @xmath12 .",
    "the final step is to obtain canonical expectations using a reweighting technique .",
    "the first two steps are long mc runs , each of which is a single mc run .",
    "we need many parameters to start fhmc simulations .",
    "short mmc simulations are required to obtain these parameters before starting fhmc simulations .",
    "the results obtained by fhmc simulations were compared to those reported in @xcite , which were obtained by mmc simulations .",
    "fhmc results were found to be in good agreement with mmc results in both model 1 and model 2 , excluding the data obtained for the largest surfaces in both models . although the variances @xmath154 and @xmath153 obtained by fhmc simulations are slightly different from those previously obtained by mmc simulations on the largest surfaces , the order of the transitions is not influenced .",
    "the reason for these differences seems to be due to the lack of statistics in the previous mmc simulations , at least on the largest surfaces .",
    "no problem is observed in fhmc simulations concerning the system size at least on the surfaces upto @xmath167 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the first - order nature of the transitions is reconfirmed by the fhmc technique and , consequently , that the fhmc technique can be successfully applied to study the phase structure of surface models .",
