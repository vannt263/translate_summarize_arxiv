    "when a massive star ( eight or more times the mass of the sun ) runs out of nuclear fuel , it develops a layered structure , which heavier elements lay in deeper layers , the innermost element being iron .",
    "this configuration becomes eventually unstable and leads to a catastrophic collapse of the star core in a time window of a few thousandths of a second , since the star can not resist the pressure of its internal gravitational force .",
    "this collapse leads to an explosion that is known as type ii supernova  @xcite .",
    "the expected rate for such an event to occur in our galaxy is one every thirty years  @xcite .",
    "the binding energy released during this process is enormous : @xmath6 ergs .",
    "the high density prevents the emission of photons , therefore @xmath7 of the energy comes out in the form of neutrinos of all types . a small fraction of them , about @xmath8 ,",
    "are produced during the neutronization process through the reaction @xmath9 , while the rest are @xmath10 pairs from later cooling reactions .",
    "on their way out , neutrinos interact inside the stellar core which is an extremely dense and neutron - rich medium .",
    "the different scattering reactions , underwent by every neutrino species , result in different energy distributions for the emitted neutrinos .",
    "muon and tau neutrinos interact only through weak neutral currents , thus they decouple deep inside the core , where a higher temperature exists , and therefore are emitted with higher energies compared to @xmath0 s and @xmath3 s . in addition , @xmath3 s suffer fewer charged current interactions than @xmath0 s , so they decouple in hotter regions , thus having an energy spectrum that is harder than that of @xmath0 s .",
    "the neutrino signal from a supernova rises first steeply and then falls exponentially with time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental detection of a neutrino signal from a supernova is therefore expected to occur in a time window of about 10 seconds .",
    "this implies that detector thresholds can , in principle , be set quite low since backgrounds are highly suppressed given the narrow time window in which the burst takes place .",
    "the detection of neutrinos emitted by sn1987a in kamiokande  @xcite and imb  @xcite began the era of neutrino astronomy . nowadays , several running or planned experiments ( superkamiokande , sno , lvd , kamland , borexino ... ) have the capability to unambiguously detect supernova neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , a liquid argon tpc like in icarus has the ability to detect neutrino bursts from supernova collapses .",
    "preliminary estimates of the expected rates yielded 76 events ( 44 from @xmath0 absorption and 32 from electron scattering assuming a 5 mev electron detection threshold)@xcite for a supernova at 10  kpc .",
    "for the absorption cross section , a threshold of 11 mev was taken into account is quoted in units of @xmath11 . ] .",
    "the energy threshold for this fermi transition is however 5.885 mev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gamow - teller transitions were not included in the total absorption rate .    in this paper , we improve the estimates for supernova neutrino rates taking into account latest developments : we use new calculations in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the absorption processes@xcite and consider all the processes that contribute to the total number of expected neutrino events , including for the first time the absorption reaction @xmath5 .",
    "we discuss the ability to determine the direction of the supernova .",
    "models of type ii supernovae predict that neutrinos are emitted with a thermal spectrum , with a temperature hierarchy among neutrino flavours : @xmath12 .",
    "the neutrino energy spectra can be described by a fermi - dirac distribution  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the temperature ( mev ) ; @xmath16 the neutrino energy ( mev ) ; @xmath17 the chemical potential and @xmath18 the number of expected neutrinos of a given species .",
    "we use @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the following values for the different neutrino temperatures are used , giving the following average energies :"
