    "ever since the pioneering work by mie  @xcite and debye  @xcite , the classical optical response of objects plays an important role in applied science  @xcite .",
    "the applications range from the spectroscopy of grains embedded in gaseous interstellar environments  @xcite to plasmonic devices on the nanoscale  @xcite . in particular the latter",
    "is a growing field of research driven by the progress in materials synthesis and processing  @xcite which provides plasmonic nanostructures of continuously increasing complexity  @xcite : nanorice  @xcite , nanorings  @xcite , or nanoshells  @xcite to name only a few .",
    "the geometry of these structures provides efficient means to tailor their optical response , opening thereby new fields of application , for instance , in biomedicine  @xcite or photovoltaics  @xcite , which in turn stimulates the design of even more intricate structures .",
    "different methods have been developed over the years to analyze light scattering by composite objects . while the approaches  @xcite extending the early analytical works  @xcite are usually restricted to spherical particles , numerical approaches are now available which do not suffer this limitation  @xcite .",
    "depending on the discretization , the methods are either surface- or volume - based . in particular the latter are very powerful since they can handle arbitrarily shaped inhomogeneous objects .",
    "but like the generalizations of mie s original approach numerical methods provide no physical picture of the interaction of light with composite objects .",
    "an appealing physical picture was first given by prodan and coworkers  @xcite for metallic nanoshells and later by preston and signorell  @xcite for dielectric core - shell particles .",
    "as pointed out by these authors the optical response of composite entities such as nanoshells can be understood within the surface mode hybridization scenario .",
    "the essence of the scenario is that the surface modes arising at the interfaces of these objects interact with each other and result in optical resonances not to be found in homogeneous objects .",
    "modifying the object s geometry changes the interaction and hence the optical response .",
    "prodan and coworkers showed that the interaction can be interpreted as a kind of hybridization . in analogy to electronic states of condensed matter , optical resonances of composite objects",
    "can thus be labelled bonding and antibonding depending on their symmetry .",
    "both prodan and coworkers  @xcite and preston and signorell  @xcite worked out the hybridization scenario within the electrostatic approximation using , respectively , a lagrangian and an eigenvalue method for the description of the charges induced at the interfaces of the object .",
    "the two approaches are very flexible , can be applied to arbitrary geometry , and require not necessarily bulk dielectric functions .",
    "they can be combined with microscopic models for the optical response of the atomic constituents of the objects and are thus well suited for applications in nanoplasmonics  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of light scattering by composite objects in terms of the hybridization scenario is often referred to as a new conceptual approach  @xcite or as a fundamentally different way of thinking about plasmonic effects  @xcite . as the mie theory is the exact analytical description of light scattering by spheres and",
    "thus naturally includes all observed effects , the question arises whether the hybridization scenario can be also found directly in the mie formulae and thus whether the new thinking can be united with the old formalism .    in this paper",
    "we show that this is indeed the case . for the particular case of a spherical core - shell particle the hybridization scenario",
    "can be straightforwardly derived from the mie theory by recasting the mie coefficients  @xcite in a form resembling the diagonal elements of a matrix resolvent describing two hybridized energy levels .",
    "the derivation , valid for all multipole orders and thus applicable to arbitrarily sized particles , starts with a splitting of the electromagnetic fields inside the shell into two parts  @xcite , corresponding to the penetrating fields of an homogeneous particle made out of shell material and the scattering fields of a cavity filled with core material and sitting inside an homogeneous domain of shell material . in a second step the expansion coefficients obtained by enforcing the boundary conditions at the core - shell and shell - medium interface",
    "are then rewritten into the desired form .",
    "the re - organization of the fields inside the shell and the re - ordering of the expansion coefficients it leads to yields no physical concepts beyond the hybridization scenario  @xcite .",
    "in fact it was inspired by it .",
    "but it is comforting to see the scenario emerge directly from the formulae of the mie theory , which are notoriously difficult to interpret .",
    "we thereby also generalize the work of ruppin  @xcite and uberoi  @xcite who showed , again only in the electrostatic approximation , that the optical response of a core - shell particle arises from two coupled subsystems .",
    "the hybridization scenario can be also found in the mie formulae for a stratified sphere .",
    "essential is again the splitting of the fields into penetrating and scattered parts and the re - organization of the expansion coefficients guided by the structure of the diagonal elements of a matrix resolvent describing hybridized energy levels .    in the next section we rewrite the mie coefficients for a spherical core - shell particle and",
    "demonstrate how the building blocks of the hybridization scenario , the medium - embedded homogeneous shell particle and the shell - embedded core cavity , can be extracted from the new expressions .",

    "the hybridization scenario becomes apparent by writing the expansion coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 in a form resembling the diagonal elements of a matrix resolvent @xmath54 describing the hybridization of two energy levels @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the basis for this matrix are the states @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "the pole of @xmath63 gives the energy of the noninteracting level @xmath64 , while the two poles of @xmath65 are the excitation energies of the interacting system .",

    "so far we extracted from the mie formulae the two elementary building blocks , a shell - embedded core cavity and a medium - embedded homogeneous shell particle , whose surface modes hybridize to make up the optical response of the core - shell particle .",
    "we now turn to the hybridization strength @xmath76 .",
    "it is interesting to analyze under what conditions it vanishes and what this implies for the expansion coefficients .",
    "the two subsystems are noninteracting when at least one of the following conditions holds : @xmath87    condition  , which implicitly defines @xmath88 , is satisfied when the refractive indices of the core and the shell are the same , @xmath89 .",

    "note , the numerator in the second equality defines the function @xmath73 appearing in eqs .   and  .",
    "thus , due to the absence of the core - shell interface , the scattering fields in the shell region vanish , leading to @xmath90 , and the penetrating fields inside the shell become equivalent to the penetrating fields of the core , signalled by @xmath92 , with expansion coefficients describing the fields inside an homogeneous particle with refractive index @xmath83 embedded in a medium with refractive index @xmath15 .",
    "the core - shell particle is in this limit reduced to a medium - embedded homogeneous shell particle .",
    "the second condition  , which implicitly defines @xmath93 , reduces the core - shell particle to a cavity embedded in an homogeneous medium . in this case",
    "the refractive indices of the medium and the shell have to be identical , @xmath94 , leading to @xmath95 and @xmath96 hence , due to the missing medium - shell interface , the penetrating fields of the shell become equal to the incoming fields , which are considered to be the penetrating fields in the medium , as can be seen by comparing eqs .   and   for @xmath97 with eqs .   and",

    "it should be noted that in the standard expansion the coefficients @xmath101 , and @xmath102 reduce in the respective limits also to the mie coefficients of a medium - embedded homogeneous shell particle and a shell - embedded core - cavity  @xcite .",
    "what we have shown by working with @xmath52 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath51 and rewriting them in a particular manner is that the two limiting cases are actually two building blocks whose resonances are always virtually present .",
