    "in astronomical spectroscopy , the so - called forbidden transitions are as important as the allowed transitions @xcite .",
    "they are seen @xcite in the spectra of rarefied gases and plasmas under special conditions , such as are found in some nebulae , solar corona , parts of active galactic nuclei and the extreme upper atmosphere of the earth .",
    "historically , the term  forbidden \" was associated with all those atomic transitions which do not involve emission or absorption of the electric dipole radiation .",
    "the forbidden lines may some times account for @xmath1 or more of the total visual brightness of an object like a planetary nebula , so much so that , when such lines were first seen in the @xmath2 s , they were thought to be due to a new element which was called as nebulium .",
    "forbidden lines are often unaffected by departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and are also insensitive to atmospheric temperature uncertainties as well as micro - turbulence . as such",
    "they have been quite useful to measure abundances , because at low densities of the order of a few atoms per cubic centimeter , the strength of a spectral line grows as @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the total number of atoms in the concerned atomic state , whereas at high densities it grows as @xmath4 .",
    "scattering of radiation by atoms involves absorption followed by spontaneous emission and the scattering phase function has to be generalized  @xcite to a @xmath5 phase matrix to include polarization state of the incoming or outgoing radiation .    with technological advances in spectropolarimetry ,",
    "accuracies of the order @xmath6 have been achieved in measuring the polarization expressed through stokes parameters . using such instruments ,",
    "it has been possible to discover a wealth of new and unexpected phenomena that are taking place in the outer layers of the solar atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "these recent observations have opened a new window to the diagnosis of the polarized light scattering phenomena in the sun and the stars  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that magnetic fields are present almost everywhere in the universe  @xcite .",
    "therefore we focus our attention on scattering in the presence of magnetic fields . in our previous papers we developed a quantum electrodynamical ( qed )",
    "approach to line scattering in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields of arbitrary strengths  @xcite .",
    "that approach can take account of all multipole type transitions , apart from the dominant one , namely , the dipole scattering . in this paper , we restrict our attention to the case of coherent scattering in the laboratory frame .",
    "the qed theory of dipole scattering , for the more realistic case of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) and partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) are respectively developed by landi deglinnocenti & landolfi ( @xcite , and references cited therein ) and by bommier @xcite .",
    "these authors consider hanle scattering in the presence of only magnetic fields of arbitrary strength .",
    "the classical non - perturbative theory of hanle - zeeman scattering with prd in atom s rest frame is presented in @xcite .",

    "@xcite present the corresponding laboratory frame expressions in a form suitable for astrophysical applications .",
    "a classical theory for the coronal forbidden emission lines that arise from magnetic dipole ( @xmath7 ) transition is derived in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is mainly to derive the phase matrices characterizing atomic scattering of polarized radiation for forbidden transitions in external magnetic fields .",
    "this approach can handle all multipoles in the transition .",
    "in particular , we present the explicit forms of the phase matrices for @xmath8 and @xmath9 type transitions , as they are not available in the literature . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we present the theoretical framework briefly . in section 4",
    "we describe 3 limiting cases of scattering in magnetic fields .",
    "the numerical examples illustrating the application of these formulae are given in section 5 .",
    "it is well - known that an energy level of an atom with total angular momentum @xmath10 splits into @xmath11 equally spaced components ( zeeman splitting ) when the atom is exposed to an external magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "these levels are characterized by states @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the magnetic quantum number which is projection of the total angular momentum operator @xmath15 along @xmath12 , which is taken along the @xmath16axis .",
    "if we consider atomic scattering @xmath17 of radiation , the elements of the on - energy - shell transition matrix @xmath18 are given  @xcite by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the profile function @xmath21 here @xmath22 denotes the frequency of the scattered radiation , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote respectively the energies associated with the initial @xmath25 , intermediate @xmath26 and final @xmath27 states of the atom , and @xmath28 denotes the natural width associated with the intermediate state .",
    "the vectors @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 are photon momenta of the incident and scattered radiation .",
    "the states of circular polarization associated with @xmath29 and @xmath31 are denoted respectively by @xmath33 following the convention employed by rose  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath34 denotes the @xmath35 density matrix representing the state of polarization of the incident radiation , the density matrix of the scattered radiation is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the hermitian conjugate of @xmath18 considered as a @xmath35 matrix with respect to the basis states of circular polarization . following  @xcite , the matrix elements for emission and absorption processes in eq .",

    "all transitions other than @xmath45 are referred to as forbidden , following the traditional usage .",
    "any density matrix @xmath46 for polarized radiation may be expressed in terms of the corresponding stokes parameters @xmath47 with @xmath48 , through @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the @xmath35 unit matrix and @xmath51 denote the well - known pauli matrices .",

    "the product @xmath60 can be converted into a sum using the conversion formula of @xcite , to which a doppler convolution is applied . in scattering on a two - level atom ( @xmath61 ) , the elements of @xmath59 can be expressed in an elegant form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is given by a similar expression where @xmath65 are now replaced by @xmath66 respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ scat_mat ] ) can be used to consider scattering in magnetic fields of arbitrary strength and orientation .",
    "therefore we refer to @xmath54 as the hanle - zeeman phase matrix .",
    "it is interesting to consider the particular case of @xmath67 scattering for forbidden transitions with @xmath68 and study the phase matrix .",
    "we consider three domains of the field strength @xmath69 , namely + ( i ) the case where @xmath69 is sufficiently strong so that the levels with different @xmath14 are distinct , leading to `` zeeman scattering '' with @xmath70 as the summation over @xmath14 in eq .",
