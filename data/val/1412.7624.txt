    "in cooperative communication networks , power allocation over channel state may bring rate gains @xcite . however , it is not easy to find the optimal power allocation because the exact capacity of most of the wireless networks has not been known .",
    "there were some useful cooperation strategies put forward in the literatures which provided efficient approach to transmit information and gave lower bounds for the rate performance of the system .",
    "for instance , two relay protocols , decode - and - forward ( df ) and compress - and - forward ( cf ) , were proposed in @xcite to evaluate the information rate for relay channels ( rc ) .",
    "particularly , the df protocol was shown to be able to achieve the capacity of degraded rc @xcite and sender frequency division rc @xcite . due to the effectiveness of df and cf , they has been widely used in cooperative communication networks , achieving good rate performance in various networks @xcite@xcite .",
    "based on df and cf protocols , power allocation can be naturally extended to general networks to combat the varying channel states .",
    "take the rc as an example again .",
    "since there are only three wireless links in the system , it is available for the source and the relay to know the current channel gains before transmissions via timely feedback from the receiver .",
    "the global power allocation over fading channel problem in rc has been studied in @xcite . by assuming that the source and the relay subject to a sum power constraint",
    ", the authors provided algorithms on how to find the optimal power allocation .",
    "it is also noted that the power allocation established in @xcite achieved the maximal throughput of the relay - receive phase and relay - transmit phase in half - duplex relay channels ( hdrc ) .",
    "the result was implicitly based on a buffer at the relay such that if the relay - destination channel is worse , it can store the message and transmit them when the relay - destination channel becomes better . in practice , if the relay has a finite storage and limited processing capability , the system may become unstable and the power allocation gain will degrade .    to improve the achievable rate ,",
    "selecting better relay protocol among multiple protocols provides another alternative .",
    "this intuition comes from theoretical analysis on combining df and cf in static rc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was found superposition structure of the df and cf codewords provides some rate gain with penalties of decoding complexity @xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover , a general insight was also obtained that df outperforms cf for only some of the channel gain combinations while the relationship reverses for the others .",
    "this implies that in fading relay channels , a hybrid scheme which selects the better one between df and cf according to the channel state may provide some rate gains while avoiding the complicated codeword design .    instead of using other techniques , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite , to combat channel fading , in this work ,",
    "we thoroughly analyze the relay power allocation over channel state when the relay adopts both df and cf protocols .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the system model and establish a general framework for the relay power allocation problem . in section iii",
    ", we present a parameterized form solution for the problem corresponding to df and cf , respectively . in section iv",
    ", we further investigate the relay power allocation corresponding to the hybrid scheme and discuss the optimal solution by introducing an auxiliary rate function .",
    "let us consider a hdrc as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ relay - ch ] . in the figure ,",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the source , the relay and the destination , respectively .",
    "we assume the relay is operated in half - duplex manner . due to the multipath effect , the channel gains are varying along with the time .",
    "we assume that the channel gains are holding constant for a fixed time length which is referred to as a block and the channel gains varies independently between consecutive blocks .",
    "the signal transmissions in each block are divided into two phases as depicted in fig .",
    "[ relay - ch ] . in _ phase 1 _",
    ", the source transmits signal while the other two nodes listen . in _ phase 2 _ , the source and the relay transmit signals to the destination . to distinguish the signal in different phases ,",
    "let us denote the complex baseband signal transmitted at @xmath3 and received at @xmath4 in _ phase @xmath5 _",
    "@xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . for simplicity , we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 to represent the channel gain variable and its realization for @xmath11-@xmath12 link in each block .",
    "accordingly , transmissions in the hdrc can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) corresponding to @xmath12 in _ phase @xmath5_. for simplicity , we consider that the system is operated in unit bandwidth and we assume that @xmath15 obeys complex gaussian distribution with unit power spectrum density , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "the source and the relay are assumed to know the channel gains at the beginning of each block . in particular , as the channel phase - shift is well - recovered at the receiver side , we focus on @xmath17 , the distribution of the amplitude of @xmath9 .",
    "for the reason of synchronization and power management , we assume that the source transmit signal with the same power and the same time length for the two phases . denote the channel state by @xmath18 . by assuming that the block length is long enough to support one time entire signalling , we can regard the system as a static relay channel for each block .",
    "in general , in the static case , the rate performance is a function of the receiver side signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the three links . to focus on the relay power allocation , we denote the receiver side snr of relay - destination link and the rate function in static hdrc by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .    in fading hdrc , we consider long time average power constraint @xmath21 at @xmath3 .",
    "then the source transmits signal with power @xmath22 regardless of the channel state .",
    "however , the relay can adjust @xmath23 adaptively w.r.t the channel state @xmath24 in each block . for clarity",
    ", we denote the relay power allocation by @xmath25 .",
    "the interest of this paper is to find the optimal power allocation @xmath26 achieving the best rate performance of the system .",
