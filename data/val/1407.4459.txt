    "the topic of whether black holes ( bhs ) in globular clusters ( gcs ) exist has long been a topic of debate .",
    "arguments have been made in favour of the presence of not only stellar - mass bhs ( @xmath3 10 - 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 ) , but also intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ; @xmath3 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7 m@xmath5 ) in some clusters .",
    "the former are descended directly from the evolution of massive ( @xmath8 25 m@xmath5 ) stars , and may or may not experience a kick upon formation due to an asymmetry in the subsequent supernova explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "imbhs , on the other hand , could form from runaway collisions in the cluster core @xcite , the direct collapse of gas in a protocluster , or accretion onto a central stellar - mass bh @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical suggestions of some kind of connection between gcs and bhs were that the gcs might be quasar remnants @xcite .",
    "this suggestion has long since been abandoned , but the discovery of a disproportionate number of x - ray sources in gcs @xcite led to the suggestion that these clusters might host black holes of @xmath9 accreting from the intracluster medium @xcite . at nearly the same time , it was found that the velocity dispersion rises toward the center of m15 , one of the x - ray bright clusters @xcite .",
    "as quickly as the evidence in favor of imbhs in gcs came together , opposing explanations to account for their signatures were introduced . the x - ray emitting globular clusters all soon showed type i x - ray bursts @xcite , which were then explained as thermonuclear runaways on the surfaces of neutron stars @xcite . the increase in central mass to light ratio in globular clusters",
    "was argued to be consistent with mass segregation putting the heavy remnants into the very centers of gcs @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs and neutron stars have very large mass - to - light ratios in the optical , and hence they can mimic a central imbh if enough of them are present .",
    "similar arguments for @xcite and against @xcite the presence of an intermediate mass black hole in m15 appeared almost 30 years later .",
    "more recently , two primary methods of indirect detection have been the focus of attempts to identify imbhs in gcs .",
    "these are the fitting of dynamical models to look for evidence of cusps in the central velocity dispersion profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and x - ray and especially radio continuum observations to look for evidence of gas accretion onto a central massive black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both kinematic- and accretion - based approaches are subject to caveats when interpreting the observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , although the detection of stellar density and kinematic cusps in gcs could be indicative of an imbh , cusp stars near the very centre of the cluster could have moderately anisotropic orbits , and this could also mimic the evidence for an imbh ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , an upper limit can be placed on the eddington ratio of an accreting imbh in a gc .",
    "but , if the gas content is poorly known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a low gas accretion rate could be indicative of a very low - density interstellar medium ( ism ) , as opposed to a low imbh mass ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other methods of detecting imbhs have also been explored .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed that individual fast - moving stars could be created in gcs hosting imbhs , and that such hypervelocity stars could be observable using the hubble space telescope .",
    "@xcite also showed that an imbh can potentially quench mass segregation , and cause the average stellar mass to vary only modestly as a function of the clustercentric radius .",
    "later , @xcite also suggested that fast - moving millisecond pulsars in the halo of our galaxy could provide indirect evidence for a substantial population of imbhs in gcs , since such high velocities are difficult to reproduce via `` standard '' formation mechanisms .",
    "currently , the observational evidence in favour of stellar - mass bhs existing in gcs is more compelling than for imbhs . to detect these bhs",
    ", they must be accreting from a binary companion .",
    "for example , @xcite first found an accreting bh in a gc associated with the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 in the virgo cluster . although its precise mass is not known , the x - ray luminosity is sufficiently high that it can not be anything other than a bh in such an old stellar population .",
    "this result was expanded upon by @xcite , who also discussed the possible implications for a central imbh .",
    "soon thereafter , @xcite reported an accreting bh in a gc hosted by the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 1399 located at the centre of the fornax cluster .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported the detection of two flat - spectrum radio sources in the galactic gc m22 .",
    "the authors presented compelling evidence that these are accreting stellar - mass bhs , the first of their kind to be detected in a galactic gc .",
    "these two detections arguably imply the presence of @xmath10 stellar - mass bhs in m22 , and could be indicative of stellar - mass bhs existing in other galactic gcs as well .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently reported a candidate bh x - ray binary in the galactic gc m62 .",
    "the exact numbers and masses of stellar - mass bhs in gcs is still being heavily debated in the literature .",
    "most , if not all , bhs should be located in the cluster core at the present - day ages of galactic gcs .",
    "this is because they should drift into the core due to mass segregation on the shortest time - scales , if they are not already born there .",
    "however , when it comes to bhs , what happens in the core rarely stays in the core .",
    "strong gravitational interactions between bhs can result in the dynamical ejection of all but one or two bhs @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the @xcite instability shows that a heavy stellar component will dynamically decouple into a central `` sub - cluster '' if it has a critical combination of both total mass and ratio of masses of individual objects in the heavy component to the light component . since the crossing time , and especially the relaxation time",
    ", is shorter for the sub - cluster than for a typical globular cluster , this sub - cluster can be expected to evaporate itself on much less than a hubble time , ejecting the bhs dynamically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , binary interactions may accelerate the process @xcite .",
    "given that all the bright ( l@xmath11 10@xmath12 erg / sec ) galactic globular cluster x - ray sources have shown strong evidence for being neutron stars , a lore developed that the spitzer instability really did lead to the evacuation of black holes from gcs . only with the discoveries of objects with strong evidence for being globular cluster black holes both in other galaxies @xcite and in the milky way s",
    "clusters @xcite was this topic carefully revisited .",
    "an important point was raised , namely , that the spitzer instability should never drive the complete evacuation of a cluster s black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since the criterion for the spitzer instability to work includes a total mass requirement on the heavy component @xcite .",
    "more recent numerical work has shown that the black hole retention fraction is similar to the neutron star retention fraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite performed @xmath2-body simulations to match the absolute and dynamical age of m22 .",
    "the authors argue that multiple bhs are retained at a cluster age of 12 gyr provided the parent cluster has an extended core radius .",
    "these results were quickly expanded upon by @xcite and @xcite , who argue that it should take on the order of ten relaxation times for the entire bh sub - population to be ejected , and that clusters with present - day half - mass relaxation times above @xmath3 1 gyr are the ones that should retain an appreciable population of bhs at 12 gyr @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the co - existence of a population of stellar - mass bhs and a central imbh in a gc . in section  [ fate ] , we use @xmath2-body simulations to demonstrate that the most massive stellar - mass bh becomes bound to the imbh on a relatively short timescale . we then discuss the evolution of the imbh - bh binary in section  [ evolve ] .",
    "using analytic methods , we weigh the probability of actually detecting bh x - ray binaries in gcs hosting an imbh in section  [ bhbinary ] .",
    "finally , our main conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "because of their relatively large masses , populations of stellar - mass bhs in gcs rapidly sink to the cluster centre due to mass segregation @xcite . here",
    ", they can undergo strong gravitational interactions with other bhs , possibly leading to their ejection from the cluster and hence a progressive depletion of the bh sub - population @xcite .",
    "if a central imbh is present , this process is accelerated @xcite . in this case , the stellar - mass bhs are ejected upon undergoing strong gravitational interactions with the imbh .",
    "the above scenario is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , which depicts the results of an @xmath2-body simulation for cluster evolution , performed using nbody6 @xcite .",
    "we use the same initial conditions and model setup as in @xcite with n = 131  072 stars initially .",
    "additional simulations are also performed for n @xmath3 64  000 and n @xmath3 32  000 stars ( not shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) , adopting again the initial conditions in @xcite . in all simulations , the imbh mass ,",
    "binary and remnant retention fractions are m@xmath13 0.01m@xmath14 , f@xmath15 0.0 , f@xmath16 0.3 , f@xmath17 0.1 , f@xmath18 1.0 @xcite .",
    "importantly , the imbh mass is chosen to be 1% of the total cluster mass at 12 gyr . for lower imbh masses ,",
    "the imbh is typically ejected from the cluster due to strong gravitational interactions with other stellar remnants and/or massive stars ( if any remain ) .",
    "specifically , the imbh masses are 833 m@xmath5 , 415 m@xmath5 and 207 m@xmath5 for the 128k , 64k and 32k models , respectively . this is larger than predicted by extending the m-@xmath19 relation observed for super - massive black holes in galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but more reasonable if the _ initial _ gc masses were much larger than their present - day values @xcite .",
    "note that we do not include any primordial binaries in these simulations to minimize the computational cost , but do allow for the dynamical formation of ( typically wide ) binaries .- body simulations under - estimate the rate of bh binary formation by not including primordial binaries .",
    "this issue is addressed by combining the results of our @xmath2-body simulations with analytic estimates for the rate of bh binary formation . ] here , we are primarily concerned with interactions between stellar - mass bhs and the central imbh .",
    "importantly , all bhs are treated as point particles and we do not consider gravitational wave emission in our simulations .",
    "thus , the orbital separation of the central imbh - bh binary only evolves due to encounters with other objects , and it never undergoes a merger .",
    "we will return to this issue in the subsequent section .    since we are interested in direct encounters with the central imbh we modified the code to output every close encounter with the imbh . for every time step the distance of each object to the imbh",
    "is calculated and , if smaller than the encounter radius @xmath20 pc , their orbital parameters obtained and saved .",
    "bound objects can be identified by their orbital energy or their recurrence in the following time steps .",
    "specifically , an encounter is classified as bound ( unbound ) if , at the first timestep after the object has passed its point of closest approach , its kinetic energy is less ( greater ) than the absolute value of its orbital energy ( with the imbh ) at that distance from the imbh .",
    "we follow the cluster evolution for @xmath8 12 gyr in all our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] depicts all encounters that occurred during the cluster lifetime .",
    "open symbols mark unbound encounters and filled symbols bound encounters .",
    "as is clear from figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , the most massive stellar - mass bh in the cluster becomes closely bound to the central imbh within the first @xmath21 myr of cluster evolution .",
    "the remaining black holes then undergo strong encounters with this central bh - imbh binary , until eventually all bhs but the central pair are ejected from the cluster .",
    "this characteristic behaviour is seen in all our simulations , however there is some stochasticity to the time required for all bhs to be ejected from the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it can occur that another bh is exchanged into the imbh - bh binary , ejecting the first companion from the cluster in the process .",
    "the final bh , not bound to the imbh , is ejected after only 4 gyr in the simulation shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this timescale ranges from @xmath3 a few 100 myr in our simulations with 32k particles to several gyr in our simulations with 128k particles ( see figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) . in the most massive gcs ( @xmath8 10@xmath22 m@xmath5 ) with the longest relaxation times , however , this timescale could be much longer and even exceed a hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , the heaviest bhs tend to be ejected first , since they have the shortest relaxation times .",
    "hence , they drift close to the cluster centre on the shortest timescales , where they undergo a strong interaction with the central imbh - bh pair .",
    "thus , we expect the ejection times for the heaviest bhs to typically be the shortest .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the evolution of the orbital properties of the central imbh - bh binary . using the @xmath2-body simulations described in section  [ fate ] , we begin with a qualitative discussion of the evolution of the imbh - bh binary prior to the final inspiral , at which point gw emission takes over as the dominant mechanism for orbital decay . here",
    ", however , we also show the results for simulations that begin with n @xmath3 32k and n @xmath3 64k particles initially , in addition to the case with n @xmath3 128k shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . the time evolution of the semi - major axes and eccentricities of the imbh - bh binaries formed in these simulations are shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ]",
    ". the key features to note are the steady decrease in orbital separation due to hardening encounters with the surrounding stellar population , and that the orbital eccentricty is close to unity for much of the binary s lifetime ( we will come back to this below ) .",
    "initially , it is dynamical friction from the surrounding population acting on the individual binary components that drives the reduction in orbital separation @xcite .",
    "eventually , scattering encounters take over as the dominant hardening mechanism .",
    "the critical semi - major axis at which this transition occurs is called the hard binary separation a@xmath23 , and is approximately given by the boundary for the imbh - bh binary to be classified as dynamically hard in the core @xcite , or : @xcite : @xmath24 where m@xmath25 m@xmath26 m@xmath27 is the total mass of the imbh - bh binary , with m@xmath28 m@xmath29 .",
    "the distance r@xmath30 gm@xmath29/@xmath31 is the influence radius of the more massive imbh .",
    "thus , the hard binary separation is inversely proportional to the square of the central velocity dispersion @xmath31 , which tends to increase with increasing cluster mass due to the virial theorem ( along with the expected imbh mass ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] via the dashed lines , as well as our @xmath2-body simulations since , at any given time , the semi - major axis of the central imbh - bh binary is larger for smaller cluster masses , and hence imbh masses .",
    "-body simulations , each beginning with a different number of particles , namely n @xmath3 32k ( blue ) , 64k ( red ) and 128k ( black ) .",
    "the dashed and solid lines correspond to a @xmath32 a@xmath23 and a @xmath32 a@xmath33 , respectively , calculated for each of our three @xmath2-body simulations assuming an eccentricity of 0.5 for the imbh - bh binary .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ]    from equation  [ eqn : hard - soft ] , the semi - mjor axis a@xmath23 of the imbh - bh binary at which scattering interactions take - over as the dominant mechanism of orbital decay could range anywhere from a few au in the most massive gc cores ( with the highest velocity dispersions and the most massive imbhs ) to on the order of 100 au in the least massive gc cores .",
    "for example , adopting component masses m@xmath34 10@xmath6 m@xmath1 and m@xmath35 10 m@xmath1 and assuming a central velocity dispersion of 10 km s@xmath36 , equation  [ eqn : hard - soft ] gives @xmath37 au roughly independent of m@xmath29 if m@xmath38 m@xmath39 m@xmath27 .",
    "we expect the eccentricity of the imbh - bh binary to evolve over time , maintaining a relatively high eccentricity ( ignoring gw emission ) .",
    "indeed , an initially non - circular orbit is the most likely scenario when the imbh - bh binary first forms @xcite .",
    "stellar encounters are not the only physical mechanism affecting the evolution of the imbh - bh binary .",
    "compact binaries lose orbital energy to gravitational waves .",
    "the timescale for a binary to merge from gravitational wave emission is : @xmath40 where a and e are the initial semi - major axis and eccentricity of the imbh - bh binary , and",
    "q @xmath32 m@xmath29/m@xmath27 is the binary mass ratio .",
    "this allows us to introduce the concept of a critical semi - major axis a at which a binary of mass ratio q and eccentricity e@xmath33 coalesces within a specified time .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , where we show curves of constant @xmath41 in the semi - major axis - eccentricity - plane .",
    "the evolution of the imbh - bh binaries in our @xmath2-body simulations are also shown by the different points . specifically , the solid black circles , open red squares and blue crosses correspond to the results of our 128k , 64k and 32k simulations , respectively . in all simulations ,",
    "the timescale for coalscence due to gw emission drops well below 1 myr , due primarily to the very high eccentricities reached by the imbh - bh binary ( we will come back to this below ) .",
    "eventually , a critical semi - major axis a@xmath33 is reached , at which point the timescale for coalescence due to gw emission is comparable to the ( instantaneous ) timescale for coalescence due to scattering interactions .",
    "the dependences of the critical semi - major axes a@xmath23 and a@xmath33 on the mass of the central imbh are shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] by the dotted and solid lines , respectively , for different eccentricities and assuming a 10 m@xmath5 bh companion .",
    "for very low eccentricities , a@xmath33 is roughly two orders of magnitude lower than a@xmath23 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 au , respectively ) for imbh masses @xmath44 m@xmath5 .",
    "however , for very high eccentricities approaching unity , we find a@xmath45 a@xmath23 at the same imbh mass .    the key point to take away from figures  [ fig",
    ": fig3 ] and  [ fig : fig4 ] is that , as the eccentricity increases , the efficiency of gw emission increases , acting to circularize the imbh - bh binary on potentially shorter timescales than scattering interactions can increase it .",

    "the evolution of the imbh - bh binaries in our @xmath2-body simulations are shown in the @xmath52(1-e)-@xmath52(a)-plane by the different points .",
    "specifically , the black solid circles , red open squares and blue crosses correspond to the results from our 128k , 64k and 32k simulations , respectively .",
    "note that , in all simulations , the semi - major axis of the imbh - bh binary decreases monotonically with time , and the time between points varies but is on the order of 10 myr .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ]     ( dotted line ) and a@xmath33 ( solid lines ) denote the critical semi - major axes at which hardening interactions and gravitational wave emission , respectively , take over as the dominant source of orbital decay .",

    "the companion bh mass is set to 10 m@xmath5 , and we show the results for orbital eccentricities e @xmath32 0 , 0.5 , 0.9 , 0.95 . also shown by the dashed line is the influence radius of the central imbh , as given by equation 3 in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ]    to summarize , the orbital eccentricity of the central imbh - bh binary reaches very high values at relatively small semi - major axes in as little as a few gyr in all our simulations , due to scattering interactions with the surrounding stellar population .",
    "this significantly reduces the timescale for the imbh - bh binary to merge due to gw emission to @xmath3 a few to a few hundred myr ( depending on the exact semi - major axis and eccentricity ) , which is not accounted for in our @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "thus , we expect many imbh - bh binaries in gc cores to merge well within a hubble time , in particular those with large masses and located in dense gcs .",
    "naively , this could reduce the timescale for the depletion of the stellar - mass bh population .",
    "these issues should be properly addressed in future @xmath2-body models that incorporate a proper treatment of the general relativistic evolution of the central imbh - bh binary .",
    "in the subsequent sections , we address in more detail whether or not any bhs should remain in a cluster hosting an imbh at the present - day and , if so , whether or not they might harbour binary companions .      in general , for the same initial bh retention fractions , the timescale for all bhs to be ejected increases with increasing cluster mass , since the relaxation time increases with increasing cluster mass ( and the number of initial bhs likely increases with cluster mass ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] . here",

    "three different fits to the data are shown by the solid , dotted and dot - dashed lines , as described in the inset .",
    "the indicated times in the inset correspond to the time at which all ( but three ) bhs have been ejected in a cluster with n @xmath32 10@xmath22 stars initially .",
    "additional @xmath2-body simulations taken from @xcite are also shown .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ]    if some bhs remain in the cluster when the first stellar - mass bh companion merges with the imbh due to gravitational wave emission , the imbh will capture another bh companion on a timescale that is comparable to the timescale for bh ejection .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , the most massive bhs tend to be ejected first .",
    "hence , each time the imbh captures an additional bh companion after undergoing a merger , the new bh is likely less massive than its predecessor(s ) .",
    "the lower companion mass increases the timescale for orbital decay due to gw emission at a@xmath33 , which contributes to decreasing the rate at which the imbh merges with other stellar - mass bhs over time .",
    "apart from this , we do not expect mergers of bhs with the central imbh to significantly change the presented picture for the dynamical depletion of a cluster s bh sub - population .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss only bhs born with a binary companion , which we call primordial bh binaries , and post - pone the discussion of their dynamical formation to the subsequent section .",
    "most , and probably all , primordial bh binaries born in the cluster core should be disrupted by the central imbh by the present - day , or ejected from the cluster .",
    "this is because the timescale for two - body relaxation in the core is less than a hubble time in even the most massive galactic gcs , but is @xmath58 gyr in a typical gc @xcite .",
    "the central two - body relaxation time provides a rough guide ( we will return to this in the next section , where we calculate a more accurate timescale ) for the timescale on which massive objects already in the core sink sufficiently deep within the cluster potential to enter the sphere of influence of the imbh - bh binary , where the force of gravity from the imbh becomes significant . for example , using equation 2.12 in @xcite and assuming a central velocity dispersion of 10 km s@xmath36 , the influence radius is @xmath3 0.04 pc for a 10@xmath6 m@xmath5 imbh , or @xmath3 0.4 pc for a 10@xmath59 m@xmath5 imbh .",
    "even if a bh binary is able to survive a direct encounter with an imbh or , more likely , an imbh - bh binary ( in the subsequent section , we quantify this probability ) , there is usually ample time for subsequent interactions to occur , since the core and even half - mass relaxation times are typically much shorter than the cluster age .",
    "this significantly increases the probability that any primordial bh binaries will be disrupted by the present - day cluster age , or even ejected from the cluster .",
    "while it is possible that some bh binaries could survive an interaction with the central imbh - bh binary and survive to the present - day by being ejected to the cluster outskirts where the timescale for dynamical friction to operate is very long , such bh binaries should be rare and should most likely still be located in the cluster outskirts at the present - day .",
    "can primordial bh binaries born outside of the core survive to the present - day ? to address this question , we consider two different types of bhs , motivated by the most recent theoretical work and defined according to the mass of their progenitor .",
    "the first type ( type i ) of bh consists of the lowest mass bhs in the cluster ( with a progenitor mass @xmath60 m@xmath5 , although the exact limit is highly uncertain ) , and experiences a significant kick upon formation @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that most bhs of type i are formed as isolated objects , and do not have a binary companion at birth .",
    "this is because , even if the bh progenitor had a binary companion when it underwent a supernova ( sn ) explosion , the imparted kick is highly likely to dissociate the binary .",
    "thus , if bhs of type i are to have binary companions , they must typically capture them via some dynamical mechanism .",
    "importantly , we expect most bhs to be of type i ( before considering ejection from the cluster due to natal kicks ) given that the initial mass function ( imf ) observed in the field and young star - forming regions rises toward lower masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with that said ,",
    "it is difficult to quantify this difference considering the considerable uncertainties in the imf in massive clusters at the high - mass end , as well as the magnitude of their natal kicks .",
    "the second type ( type ii ) of bh constitutes the most massive stellar remnants in the cluster ( with the possible exception of an imbh ) with a progenitor mass @xmath61 m@xmath5 , and does not experience a kick upon formation , since the progenitor collapses directly to a bh without a supernova explosion , and with little mass - loss @xcite .",
    "40 m@xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we expect significant mass loss due to stellar winds in such massive star progenitors near the eddington limit , and this could also significantly lower the final bh mass relative to the initial progenitor mass .",
    "we use this division in mass , given originally in @xcite , as a guide to help explore the possible presence of a sub - population of especially massive stellar - mass bhs that do not experience natal kicks . ]",
    "thus , it is entirely possible , and even likely , that bhs of type ii are born with a binary companion , given the high binary fractions among massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , given the large masses of these bhs , they have very short dynamical friction timescales , even at very large clustercentric radii . to check this",

    "we conclude that most , if not all , primordial bh binaries should have either been disrupted by the central imbh - bh binary or ejected from the cluster by the present - day .      ignoring kicks imparted by dynamical interactions in the core , most bhs will spend at least some of their lifetimes in the cluster core .",
    "the exceptions are type ii bhs born at very large clustercentric radii ( well beyond the half - mass radius and , for all but the most massive gcs with the longest relaxation times , likely very near to the tidal radius ) , and type i bhs kicked to comparably large clustercentric radii by their natal supernova kick or an encounter with the central imbh .",
    "any type i bhs born at large clustercentric radii are likely to be ejected from the cluster due to their natal sn kick .",
    "the key point that most bhs will potentially spend significant time in the core is important since , as we will explain below , dynamical mechanisms for bh binary formation require a high stellar density to be efficient .",
    "thus , _ most bh binaries should form in the core _",

    "this will either dissociate any binary companions the bhs may have acquired , or eject them from the cluster .",
    "we note that binaries formed from exchanges ( and tidal capture events ; see below ) typically are not compact , and only very compact binaries are expected to survive an encounter with the central imbh - bh binary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a second possible formation scenario for bh binaries involves an isolated bh acquiring a binary companion in the cluster core via tidal capture , most likely of a single main - sequence ( ms ) star .",
    "we adopt the tidal capture timescale given in @xcite , with an additional factor ( 1 - f@xmath65)@xmath36 , where f@xmath65 is the binary fraction in the cluster core .",

    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * a central imbh will typically capture the most massive stellar - mass bh in a binary early on in the cluster lifetime .",
    "the imbh will retain a bh companion until the bh spirals in , due to scattering interactions with neighbouring objects and gravitational wave emission , and merges . * for typical imbh masses in gcs following from the m-@xmath19 relation @xcite ,",
    "gravitational wave emission is likely to play an important role in deciding the evolution of the imbh - bh binary orbital parameters , often while hardening interactions with the surrounding stellar population also drive orbital decay .",
    "thus , gw emission should be accounted for in future related studies .",
    "* _ _ in most galactic gcs , the detection of one or more bh binaries can be used to place strong constraints on the possible presence of an imbh . _",
    "_ * if the ( instantaneous ) timescale for bhs in the cluster core to flow through the loss - cone and undergo strong interactions with the central imbh - bh binary is longer than the formation time for bh binaries , then at least some isolated bhs will have time to acquire binary companions _ before _ interacting with the imbh , at which point they are typically ejected from the cluster .",
    "importantly , we assume throughout this paper that the imbh mass is @xmath107% of the _ present - day _ cluster mass . this is larger than predicted by extending the m-@xmath19 relation observed for smbhs in galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but not unreasonable if gcs were once considerably more massive than their present - day masses suggest . for lower imbh masses",
    ", even the imbh can be ejected from the cluster due to dynamical interactions with other massive remnants . in this case",
    ", our results do not apply .",
    "if an imbh is retained , our results for each initial total cluster mass can be extended to lower imbh masses as follows .",
    "first , for a given number of bhs ( and host cluster properties ) , lowering the central imbh mass should increase the timescale for all bhs to be ejected from the cluster .",
    "this is because individual interactions between the imbh and bhs tend to be less energetic , and thus less likely to accelerate bhs to velocities that exceed the escape speed .",
    "second , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , for a given cluster mass and hence central velocity dispersion , lowering the central imbh mass in turn increases the critical semi - major axis a@xmath23 at which hardening interactions begin to dominate the rate of orbital decay , and decreases the critical semi - major axis a@xmath33 at which gravitational wave emission begins to dominate .",
    "thus , for lower imbh masses , the role of hardening interactions increases at small semi - major axes , where the imbh - bh binary cross - section is at its smallest .",
    "this prolongs the lifetime of the imbh - bh binary by increasing the time it spends with a semi - major axis @xmath8 a@xmath33 .",
    "the net result is an increase in the merger time of the imbh - bh binary .",
    "the evolution of the imbh - bh binary ( along with the time for it to merge ) can be accurately modeled with minimal computational expense for semi - major axes a @xmath108 a@xmath23 using a combination of analytic methods and numerical scattering experiments .",
    "this can be done for any combination of imbh - bh binary orbital parameters , as well as central cluster densities and velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "we caution that the timescales presented in this paper depend to some degree on the initial cluster conditions , which are in general quite uncertain .",
    "this includes the initial density and concentration , the initial cluster mass , the degree to which cluster s are initially tidally over- or under - filling , the initial numbers and spatial positions of stellar - mass bhs and binaries , the maximum bh mass , etc .",
    "we also do not consider bhs formed through binary evolution due to the considerable uncertainties inherent to this formation pathway , although we expect this contribution to the total number of bhs to be small compared to the number of primordial bhs .",
    "all of these uncertainties affect our estimates for the initial numbers , ejection times and survival probabilities of bhs , as well as the characteristic semi - major axes of any central imbh - bh binary ( i.e. a@xmath23 and a@xmath33 ) and thus its quantitative evolution .",
    "this paper illustrates that the numbers of bh binaries in gcs can potentially be used to constrain the possible presence of an imbh ( or at least an upper limit for its mass ) , and provides a useful benchmark for future studies focusing on individual clusters .",
    "interestingly , if an imbh is present _ and _ it has a bh binary companion at the present - day cluster age , the distribution of ejected stars and/or compact binaries could be asymmetric .",
    "this is because the escapers are typically ejected in the plane of the imbh - bh binary , but forming a wide jet if the binary is eccentric .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility of observing a weakly visible and wide jet of escaping stars and/or compact binaries .",
    "indeed , such an asymmetry may already have been observed .",
    "for example , @xcite reported a possible asymmetry in the spatial distribution of binaries ( emitting x - rays ) about the cluster centre in the core - collapsed globular cluster ngc 6397 .",
    "the issue of whether or not such a wide jet would actually be observable in some clusters will be the topic of a future paper .",
    "however , we note that , to the best of our knowledge , such an asymmetry in the distribution of ejected objects can only be produced via a massive central _ binary_. this is because the distribution of ejection velocities should be isotropic if they originated from a strong interaction with an isolated imbh , or even during a resonant encounter with a stellar - mass bh or even ns binary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , an isotropic distribution of high - velocity escapers can not be used to unambiguously identify the presence of an imbh , since encounters with bh or ns binaries could also reproduce such a signature .",
    "similarly , previous authors have argued that , although the kinematic signatures will be difficult to measure with present - day telescopes , an imbh - imbh binary could produce a population of a few hundred suprathermal stars moving at anomalously high velocities @xcite .",
    "the orbital angular momenta of these objects should be preferentially aligned with that of the imbh - bh binary , creating an anisotropy in the angular momentum distribution of cluster stars . thus far",
    ", no asymmetry is clearly present in either ngc 104 @xcite or @xmath63 cen @xcite , although a signal may be present in ngc 2808 @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that , in clusters with strong interaction times that are longer than the bh binary formation time , such an anisotropy may also be present ( and easier to observe ) , and should be looked for , in the distribution of x - ray binaries in the cluster .",
    "our results can be extended to include as well neutron star x - ray binaries , although more work is needed in this direction .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , it takes longer for a cluster s ns population to be depleted via interactions with a central imbh than it does for its bh population .",
    "this is due to the smaller masses of nss , and hence their longer relaxation times .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility of using the ratio of bh to ns x - ray binaries ( or simply the absolute numbers of ns x - ray binaries in clusters with very few or no bhs ) as a diagnostic for probing the possible presence of an imbh , since it accelerates the rate of ejection of ( preferentially massive ) objects from the cluster . in massive clusters with very long relaxation times",
    ", it follows that the bh x - ray binary population should be more depleted due to strong interactions with the imbh than the ns x - ray binaries .",
    "moreoever , ns x - ray binaries could potentially provide a more useful tracer of an anisotropy in the angular momentum distribution in clusters for which the timescale for all bhs to be ejected is shorter than the cluster age .",
