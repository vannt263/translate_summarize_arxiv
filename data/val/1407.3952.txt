    "since its first experimental observation in gases in the mid-1990s @xcite , laser filamentation , i.e. , the nonlinear propagation of ultrashort intense laser pulses , has attracted extensive attentions due to its physical interest , as well as its important applications including few - cycle optical pulse generation , terahertz generation , supercontinuum generation , and remote sensing @xcite .",
    "the main feature of filamentation is its ability to sustain very high intensities ( around 50tw/@xmath0 ) over very long distances in contrast with predictions of linear propagation theory .",
    "when exposed to such laser field intensities , atoms and molecules exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics leading to the observation of phenomena such as multiphoton and tunnel ionization , harmonic generation , and nonadiabatic molecular alignment .",
    "the last is a process that occurs when non - spherical molecules are exposed to a short and intense laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the nonresonant interaction , driven by a pulse of duration much shorter than the classical rotational period , results in the production of postpulse transient molecular alignment revivals .",
    "the possibility of confining in space the rotational axes of a molecule , in the absence of the strong driving field , has been found particularly useful in various fields extending to high - harmonic generation and attophysics @xcite , molecular tomography @xcite , molecular - frame photoelectron angular distribution @xcite , control of molecular scattering @xcite , and more generally study of direction - dependent interactions , to mention but a few . moreover , field - free molecular alignment results in a modification of the local optical refractive index , which has been used for controlling the propagation dynamics of weak beams @xcite and filaments @xcite . simulating laser pulse propagation over macroscopic distances in an aligned molecular medium",
    "is complicated by the need to include quantum - mechanical laser - molecule dynamics .",
    "while molecular alignment calculations are routinely performed with the time - dependent schrodnger equation , its consideration in the context of two - dimensional laser propagation requires high numerical resources . instead , the standard treatment of molecular alignment in propagation simulations consists of approximating the refractive index modification with a perturbation model , in which the rotational populations of the system remain unchanged upon the laser field application . in this approximation , the refractive index modification induced by molecular alignment",
    "is expressed as a convolution between the temporal pulse profile and the impulsive response of the molecule .",
    "this procedure provides a fast and efficient evaluation of the effect of molecular alignment that is convenient for laser propagation simulations . while this approximation is valid for the weak field regime , the present work shows that it is no longer valid for intensities encountered in a filament , i.e. , a tens of tw/@xmath0 .",
    "nonlinear propagation simulations are compared using the weak field and the full quantum - mechanical treatment .",
    "two cases can be distinguished .",
    "when a filament propagates through a thermal ensemble of molecules , the weak field model well reproduces the full quantum simulation . on the contrary ,",
    "when a filament propagates through an ensemble of molecules previously aligned by a second laser filament , the weak field model fails at reproducing the propagation dynamics of the first filament .",
    "this is particularly the case when the delay between the two pulses matches the half rotational period of the molecule @xcite .",
    "the paper is divided as follows .",
    "the first section is devoted to the refractive index modification induced by molecular alignment using the strong and weak field model . in the second section , numerical simulations of filamentation in molecular gases",
    "are performed using a strong field modeling of molecular alignment .",
    "their predictions are compared with those obtained with the  standard \" weak field model for the one- and two - pulse cases .",
    "it is shown that the weak field model well reproduces the results obtained with the strong field model in the case of a single filament .",
    "on the contrary , it fails at reproducing pump - pump experiments in which a laser filament propagates in the wake of a second filament .",

    "the molecular alignment can be split into two distinct components that differ by their temporal structures .",
    "the first one , called _ alignment revival _ , appears at each quarter of the rotational period @xmath20 .",
    "it results from the periodic rephasing of the rotational wavepacket .",
    "the revival amplitude is proportional to the laser intensity in the weak field regime , i.e. , below 60 tw/@xmath0 for nitrogen at room temperature .",
    "one has to emphasize that whereas the shape of the revivals is constant in the weak field regime approximation , the structural shape of the revival is no longer conserved when the field becomes stronger , as shown in fig .",

    "therefore , the result of the field action is to increase the total angular momentum @xmath23 while its projection @xmath24 remains constant .",
    "the permanent alignment is a direct consequence of the presence in the wavepacket of aligned rotational state with @xmath25 .",
    "the permanent component becomes significant for intense electric field and scales approximatively as the square of the laser intensity , as shown in fig .",

    "calculation of two - dimensional propagation in laser - aligned molecules requires high numerical resources . to circumvent this problem ,",

    "the change of refractive index can be obtained through a convolution with @xmath27 : @xmath38 the knowledge of the impulse response @xmath39 then allows to evaluate the nonlinear refractive index change in the weak field limit .",
    "figure [ impulse_response ] displays the impulse response of air at ambient conditions calculated within the weak field framework .",
    "it has been obtained by adding the relative contributions of nitrogen and oxygen molecules .",
    "the nonlinear refractive index can also be estimated by describing molecular alignment as a three - level nonresonant process @xcite , as depicted in fig .",

    "however , this contribution mainly affects the index after the field extinction , so that it only marginally impacts the pulse propagation dynamics .",
    "the weak field theory is thus well suited for nonlinear propagation simulations in the case of a single pulse .     and",

    "calculations have been performed for 100 fs ( fwhm ) collinearly polarized pulses as a function of the peak intensity and time delay . at low intensity ( 10 tw/@xmath53 ) , the permanent alignment is weak and the discrepancy between the two models remains marginal .",
    "this confirms that the perturbation framework is justified below this peak intensity value .",
    "it is clear that it does not apply at large intensity ( 90 tw/@xmath53 ) , where the discrepancy between the two models depends on the relative delay between the two pulses .",

    "a slight deviation of the weak field model from the strong field prediction can be noticed at the falling part of the curves .",

    "for instance , the weak field model predicts that the probe filament starts about 40 cm before the position predicted by the strong field model .",
