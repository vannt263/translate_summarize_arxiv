    "ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions as performed within experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven offer a unique opportunity to study the nuclear phase diagram at high temperatures and densities @xcite . for such extreme conditions the fundamental theory of strong interactions ( quantum chromo dynamics - qcd ) , i.e. lattice qcd calculations @xcite predict a transition to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons ( qgp ) .",
    "this state is believed to behave like a strongly coupled liquid rather than a free parton gas @xcite .",
    "it is a generally accepted opinion that the preconditions for the phase transition to a qgp are readily fulfilled at rhic energies . in the meantime",
    "exist several experimental evidences that such a phase transition has indeed been seen @xcite .",
    "the strongest theoretical argument comes from lattice qcd which predicts the phase transition at a critical temperature of around @xmath2 which corresponds to a critical energy density of around @xmath3 ( depending on the number of degenerate quark flavours ) at zero net baryon density @xcite .",
    "estimates from pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles and elliptic flow results from the phobos collaboration indicate that in central collisions at @xmath0 energy densities @xmath4 are produced @xcite when the system reaches approximate equilibrium .",
    "such high energy densities , which are about twenty times the energy density inside nuclei and about six times the energy density inside nucleons , exceed clearly the values for the critical energy density predicted from lattice qcd .",
    "however , lattice calculations are performed for equilibrated matter and infinite systems .",
    "this rises questions for the size of the space - time volume in which a heavy ion collision exceeds the critical energy density and also the degree of equilibration which is reached inside this volume .",
    "therefore the evolution and absolute magnitudes of the energy density within the first few fm / c after the collision are of particular interest .    also the fact that the system enters the hydrodynamical regime at rhic energies @xmath5",
    "is often interpreted as an evidence for a phase transition @xcite .",
    "in contrast to sps , at rhic a simultanous description of elliptic flow pattern as well as of low @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) single particle spectra around mid - rapidity can be achieved within the hydrodynamics approach .",
    "this success has led to the conclusion that the created matter behaves like an _ ideal fluid _ with almost negligible viscosity @xcite and that the time scale to reach such an locally equilibrated state is extremely short , i.e. less than @xmath8 @xcite .    from an experimental point of view , it is almost impossible to extract information about initial pressure or energy densities and their equilibration times .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations themselves provide only little insight in these questions since they are based on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium and short equilibration times . however ,",
    "also hydrodynamics does not provide a perfect description of rhic data .",
    "in particular , deviations of the hydrodynamical predictions for @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the measured elliptic flow were recently interpreted as a breakdown of the hydrodynamical picture and a hint towards incomplete equilibration @xcite . in the hydrodynamics",
    "approach an ansatz for the early stage , i.e. at about @xmath8 after the initial collision , is used as input for the evolution of the system .",
    "this requires to fix the initial energy density and net - baryon number density profiles .",
    "usually for both distributions a boost - invariant distribution over a wide range of @xmath11 , the so called space - time rapidity is chosen .",
    "transport models on the other hand , allow to study the dynamical evolution of thermodynamical properties of the colliding system from a microscopic point of view .",
    "string - cascade models of that type , e.g. urqmd @xcite , hsd @xcite or the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) , do not contain an explicit phase transition to a deconfined partonic state but they can be used to study the preconditions for a possible phase transition and the results can be compared with the assumptions made by hydrodynamical approaches .",
    "the quark - gluon string model , applied in the present work and described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite is a string model based on gribov regge theory .",
    "the main assumption within these kind of ( string- ) models is that hadrons are produced as a result of excitation and decay of open strings with different quarks or diquarks at their ends .",
    "the qgsm provides a safe basis for the present investigations since it has been demonstrated to describe the elliptic flow bulk properties at sps and in particular at rhic energies reasonably well @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain an impression of the temporal evolution of the energy density @xmath12 we consider as two typical examples a central ( @xmath13 ) and a semi - peripheral ( @xmath14 ) au+au reaction at top rhic energy of @xmath0 . in the present approach the energy density is locally determined in cells of @xmath15 volume through the scalar mass density of all formed and pre - formed hadrons inside these cells .",
    "all qgsm results are obtained from averages over 200 central reactions ( @xmath13 ) , respectively 600 semi - peripheral reactions ( @xmath14 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "kinetic contributions to the energy density are neglected .",
    "thus , the @xmath12 values presented in the following analysis have to be interpreted as lower limits of the total amount achieved in the collisions . to clarify this a bit more ,",
    "let us consider a central collision at the very first instant when the two lorentz contracted gold nuclei with a longitudinal size of @xmath16 and a transverse area of @xmath17 overlap totally .",
    "this yields an energy density of @xmath18 in this approach .",
    "[ fig1 ] displays the time evolution of the local energy density @xmath12 in the x - z plane as a function of the system time @xmath19 in the c.m .",
    "frame of the colliding nuclei .",
    "one should thereby keep in mind that the corresponding hypersurfaces where @xmath20 is evaluated are essentially different form hypersurfaces of proper time @xmath21 which are used to characterize the time evolution in hydrodynamics .",
    "the latter case will be discussed later on .",
    "one immediately recognises in the contour plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , that most particles do not stay in the central collision zone but rather form some kind of `` shock waves '' , i.e. two disks in the fragmentation regions occupied with large numbers of produced particles which propagate with high rapidities in front of the expanding system . as a result of that",
    ", the energy density in these zones stays at a high level for the whole time under consideration and decreases only slowly .",
    "therefore most collisions happen within these zones while the center of the volume between the two disks is rapidly thinning out of hadrons .",
    "after the first initial collisions energy densities of a few tens of gev are achieved in the overlap zone of the central as well as semi - peripheral reaction .    to study the initial phase and the overlap zone more closely , we consider now the average energy density inside a larger volume of @xmath22 .",
    "for the central reaction we choose the central reaction zone , i.e. the most central cell given by @xmath23 and for the @xmath14 case a volume shifted by @xmath24 in x - direction , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the time evolution of @xmath12 in the corresponding cells .",
    "one sees , that for the central collision a maximum energy density of around @xmath27 is reached while the semi - peripheral collision reaches a maximal @xmath12 of around @xmath28 .",
    "again , we want to emphasize that all particles are taken into account , i.e. first of all no rapidity cut is applied .",
    "the energy density stays almost constant during the first @xmath29 .",
    "it is even slightly increasing due to the ongoing particle production through scattering of projectile and target nucleons and the corresponding continous energy deposit .",
    "as soon as the fastest particles start to leave the cell , what happens at around @xmath30 , @xmath12 is rapidly decreasing .",
    "this means that we obtain energy densities of @xmath27 in a space - time volume of at least @xmath31 in the central collision and correspondingly about @xmath28 in the same volume for the semi - peripheral reaction . however , at that time the system is far from local equilibrium , as will be seen later on .",
    "it is stated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the value of the energy density for such a system , although well defined , may not be very interesting .",
    "the potentially more interesting quantity should be the energy density carried by particles which are closer to equilibrium conditions , wherefore the analysis in @xcite was restricted to hadrons with pseudorapidities @xmath32 . to make a comparison between the estimates of the phobos collaboration and the qgsm results more transparent ,",
    "two additional curves for the temporal evolution of @xmath12 with the same @xmath32 restriction are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here",
    ", energy densities in the order of @xmath33 in the central collisions and @xmath34 in the semi - peripheral reactions are obtained after @xmath29 time of evolution .",
    "these values are in nice agreement with the lower limit estimation of @xmath35 produced in central au+au collisions at rhic after @xmath36 , as it is reported by the phobos collaboration @xcite .",
    "note , that also the qgsm results are lower limits of the produced energy densities as mentioned before .",
    "the actual densities could easily be significantly larger .",
    "nevertheless , the parton - string cascade model is not able to equilibrate completely the system at such short time scales , as we will discuss later on .    as clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the geometry of the colliding system is dominated by the leading particles which move practically on the light cone in beam @xmath37 direction . in order to remove distortions from lorentz contraction effects in a rapidly longitudinally expanding system",
    "one can introduce the so called space - time rapidity @xmath11 .",
    "this is done by the introduction of cylindrical coordinates in @xmath19- and @xmath38-direction according to @xmath39 with the longitudinal proper time @xmath40 .",
    "the space - time rapidity is then given by the following expression : @xmath41 the evolution of the energy density can now be displayed as a function of the boost - invariant variable @xmath11 .",
    "[ e_1 - 12fm ] shows the energy density in the @xmath42 plane at the same time steps as have been used in fig .",
    "the @xmath43-coordinate is thereby restricted to the interval @xmath44 .    also as a function of @xmath11",
    "the system has an energy density distribution with a nontrivial shape in the reaction plane . for the central collision",
    ", @xmath12 is rather gaussian distributed in x - direction whereas it shows a characteristic double - peaked structure in @xmath11-direction , where the maxima follow the leading particles .",
    "this qualitative feature of the energy density distribution is practically maintained in the overlap zone of the semi - peripheral collision , albeit it is narrower distributed along the x - axis .",
    "additionally , one clearly recognises the @xmath12 contributions of the spectators ( `` shoulders '' at large @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) which propagate with about the same velocity as the high density bumps formed by the leading particles . within the first few fm",
    "/ c of the expansion the central values are large , i.e. @xmath47 and the distributions are more compact .",
    "however , as already seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath12 drops rapidly when the system expands .",
    "this decrease with increasing time is more pronounced in the central zone forming the `` dip '' than for the bumps following the leading particles .",
    "but also there the absolute values drop significantly and the peaks get washed out due to ongoing secondary collisions between the produced hadrons .",
    "complementary to the energy density in the reaction plane , the corresponding distributions of @xmath12 in the transversal ( x - y ) plane are depicted in fig .",
    "[ e_eta0 ] . here",
    "we consider only the central reaction with @xmath48 .",
    "the contributions of the leading particles are subtracted by restricting the space - time rapidity to the interval @xmath49 in all the four time steps under consideration .",
    "the distributions look now more isotropic , i.e. gaussian shaped in x- and y - direction , and are peaked at the origin of the transversal plane . as already seen from the previous figures , the peak value of @xmath12 reaches up to @xmath27 for @xmath50 . although the energy density is rapidly decreasing in the transverse directions as well as in time , there exist definitely regions with values of @xmath12 within the first @xmath51 , that are higher than the expected critical energy density for a phase transition to a deconfined phase .",
    "finally , the energy density @xmath12 is evaluated for the central reaction at constant proper time @xmath52 .",
    "the qgsm result is shown in fig .",
    "[ e_tau1 ] .",
    "the depicted distributions can be directly compared with initial energy density distributions used in hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 distribution in the reaction plane as obtained in the qgsm is rather similar to the initial energy densities investigated by hirano et al . for au+au collisions at @xmath53 in a hydrodynamical model @xcite .",
    "the distribution is nearly flat in the region @xmath54 and connects to vacuum as a kind of gaussian function sharply decreasing in the forward and backward space - time rapidity regions .",
    "the direct comparison of the microscopically determined density profile on the one side and a hydrodynamical model assumption from ref .",
    "@xcite on the other side  illustrated in fig .",
    "[ e_tau2 ]  exemplifies this fact . also in the transversal plane",
    "the shape and order of magnitude of @xmath12 at @xmath52 is supported by a hydrodynamical calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the nexus event generator @xcite has been used to determine the initial conditions for central au+au collisions at @xmath53 .",
    "there it has been shown that fluctuations of the initial conditions produced by a microscopic model and used as input for hydrodynamical calculations are important and lead to discrepancies for some observables .",
    "together with our findings for the averaged distributions of energy density the assumption of smooth and symmetric initial conditions seems to be a rather rough one .",
    "as one can expect from the energy density distributions of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , global equilibrium can not be reached ; the distributions of particles are far from being isotropic for all time steps under consideration .",
    "but when one looks in more detail , some cells could reach local equilibrium . in order to measure the degree of kinetic equilibration for a given cell ,",
    "the pressure components for the x- , y- and z - direction are calculated @xcite .",
    "the diagonal elements of the pressure tensor in a cell according to the virial theorem are given by @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the volume of the cell , @xmath57 is the mass and @xmath58 are the momentum components of hadron @xmath59 .",
    "the sum runs over all hadrons in the corresponding cell . the pressure is locally evaluated , therefore a lorentz transformation with the average velocity in the x- , y- and z - direction is applied before taking the sum .",
    "the requirement of isotropic velocity distributions , i.e. kinetic equilibrium , is closely related to the requirement of the pressure isotropy , which would imply @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the equilibration ratio @xmath61 as defined by @xmath62 is evaluated for each cell as a measure of local equilibration .",
    "local equilibrium in the corresponding cell is then characterized by @xmath63 .",
    "first of all , the equilibration process is studied for the central cell of the collision , given by @xmath64 for @xmath13 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 for @xmath14 , by looking at the pressure for all three directions .",
    "[ eq ] shows the pressure components as defined in eq .",
    "( [ press_comp ] ) for the central and the semi - peripheral collisions . in both reactions",
    "the longitudinal pressure is clearly dominating the very early evolution of the system while the transversal pressure components in x- and y - direction are nearly equal .",
    "at @xmath67 the longitudinal pressure starts to decrease drastically and reaches a level close to the transversal pressure after @xmath68 time of evolution .",
    "thereafter all the three corresponding pressure components decrease with similar slopes .",
    "nevertheless , the pressure isotropy is not yet achieved because deviations up to @xmath69 between the longitudinal and transversal components occur during the next @xmath70 . following the discussion in @xcite",
    ", one can call this a pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "it sets in very quickly for both , the central and the semi - peripheral collision , whereas the dynamics of the kinetic equilibration process during the pre - equilibrium stage is somewhat different for both reactions .",
    "this difference in the degree of equilibration is clearly seen , when one additionally looks at the equilibration ratio @xmath61 defined in eq .",
    "[ equi_ratio ] .",
    "[ eq1 ] depicts @xmath61 in the central cell of the overlap zone for central and semi - peripheral au+au collisions .",
    "again , the pre - equilibrium stage with @xmath71 is reached for central collisions after @xmath72 corresponding to a time when the high density areas as seen in fig . [ fig1 ] and fig . [ fig2 ] have completely passed through the central cell . within these high density areas the longitudinal pressure is clearly dominating and therefore no equilibrium can be reached . during the next few fm / c the transverse pressure components are slightly dominating the expansion ; the equilibration ratio tends to be greater than one .",
    "but it decreases already after @xmath73 time of evolution and  as the cell is loosing more and more particles  approaches almost local equilibrium after @xmath74 .",
    "the transverse pressure components @xmath75 and @xmath76 are nearly equal to each other during this stage , what reflects the symmetry of the collision zone in the transverse plane .    in case of the semi - peripheral collision with an impact parameter of @xmath77 local equilibrium",
    "seems not to be reached in the cell corresponding to the overlap zone of the collision after @xmath78 , but nevertheless @xmath61 gets at least very close to unity .",
    "after the high density areas passed through the cell , the transverse pressure is clearly dominating the next few fm / c of the pre - equilibrium stage ",
    "stronger than in the central collision , but in contrast to the central reaction it is itself not equilibrated . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eq ] , the y - component of the pressure tends to be greater ( up to 30% ) than the x - component .",
    "this asymmetry arises due to the elliptical overlap of the colliding nuclei and reflects the smaller pressure gradients in the y - direction , which , in the hydrodynamical picture , is responsible for the build - up of elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "the question , to what extent the produced matter reaches thermalization and how fast this may be achieved , is still open . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the linear rise of elliptic flow , in particular @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the eccentricity of the spatial overlap of the colliding nuclei at rhic , with the density gives rise to the conclusion of a density dependence and hence to a small number of collisions per particle .",
    "thermalization could therefore not be reached so fast .",
    "our findings of equilibration at around @xmath81 together with the elliptic flow results and their time evolution obtained in the qgsm @xcite support this picture and contradict quasi the usual hydrodynamical assumptions of fast thermal equilibration .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eq1 ] a certain fraction of the produced particles , i.e. hadrons with pseudorapidities @xmath32 , is closer to local equilibrium even at times @xmath82 . in between the two currents of matter of the target and projectile fragmentation regions , which make up @xmath83 of the energy density ,",
    "this fraction provides a dense and roughly equilibrated local surrounding even at very early times of central heavy ion collisions .",
    "thus we find energy densities of about @xmath84 in central au+au reactions at @xmath85 for matter which can be considered to be at least in a pre - equilibrium stage already at @xmath36 .",
    "the preconditions for a phase transition , i.e. energy densities @xmath86 , are given for a duration of @xmath87 in a space - time volume of about @xmath88 .",
    "finally , the degree of local equilibration and its time evolution is evaluated in the whole reaction ( @xmath89 ) plane for the central and semi - peripheral au+au collisions .",
    "all the results depicted in fig .",
    "[ eq4fm ] for the three time steps @xmath90 show a characteristic saddle structure , which is more smoothly and faster developed in the central than in the semi - peripheral reaction .",
    "for the x - direction the equilibration ratio @xmath91 always has a minimum in the overlap zone whereas it reaches here the maximum as a function of the longitudinal coordinate z. the high density areas in front of the expanding system , in other words at large values of z , never reach local equilibrium ; only in the aftermath of the pass - through the inner cells tend towards kinetic equilibration indicated by @xmath71 . in the center of the collision",
    "the transverse pressure is dominating at all times , therefore is @xmath92 . but towards higher densities in the z - direction the longitudinal , i.e. z - component of the pressure is increasing and therefore supplying more equilibrated zones filled with outward moving particles . since the most collisions naturally happen within the high density areas , it is important to notice that the most secondary particle interactions take place in a non - equilibrated surrounding .",
    "closing the discussion , it should be mentioned that string - cascade models provide most likely an upper limit for relaxation times towards local equilibrium .",
    "this is not only due to the fact that models of this type do not contain a phase transition to partonic degrees of freedom which are expected to equilibrate much faster .",
    "standard string - cascade models violate detailed balance since particle production through string decays leads to processes @xmath93 with two initial and n final state hadrons .",
    "however , corresponding backward processes @xmath94 are not included .",
    "this approximation is usually justified by the assumption that many - body scattering processes @xmath95 play a minor role in open , fast expanding systems . however , when high particle densities are achieved such processes can become relevant , e.g. for the production of rare hadron species @xcite .",
    "many - body processes , such as string or hadron fusion and recombination , lead naturally to shorter equilibration times , as has e.g. be demonstrated in @xcite for the gluonic sector . in very dense states of matter it is expected that interactions among strings , before they fragment into hadrons , are able to accelerate the equilibration process in microscopic string models .",
    "possible concepts in this context are the before mentioned string fusion , the formation of string clusters , and eventually percolation of strings , which have been considered in several string - cascade models @xcite .",
    "effectively , such processes describe reactions of @xmath96 initial particles going to @xmath97 final state hadrons .",
    "nevertheless , detailed balance is still violated . but",
    "future studies should be dedicated to the question how far these multi - string processes are able to reduce quantitatively the relaxation times towards local equilibrium .",
    "in this survey , we have analysed several aspects of the collision dynamics in central and semi - peripheral au+au reactions at the highest rhic center of mass energy of @xmath0 within the microscopic quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) , which is based on the colour exchange mechanism for string formation .",
    "the first major topic was dedicated to the time evolution of the local energy density @xmath12 .",
    "maximum energy densities of around @xmath27 for the central collisions and around @xmath28 in semi - peripheral reactions are reached in the overlap zone after the first initial hadron collisions .",
    "the energy density stays almost constant in the central cell during the first @xmath29 time of evolution .",
    "the value of @xmath12 in this cell is rapidly decreasing as soon as the fastest particles start to leave the cell .",
    "this happens at around @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath12 distributions in the x - z plane as a function of the system time @xmath19 in the c.m .",
    "frame of the colliding nuclei reveal , that most particles do not stay in the central collision zone but form two disks in the fragmentation regions occupied with large numbers of produced particles which travel practically on the light cone in beam @xmath37 direction . also as a function of the boost - invariant space - time rapidity @xmath11",
    ", the system has an energy density distribution with a nontrivial shape in the reaction plane , i.e. a characteristic double - peaked structure in @xmath11-direction which is maintained in the central and also in the semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "complementary to the energy density in the reaction plane , the corresponding distributions of @xmath12 in the transversal plane and additionally at constant proper time @xmath98 were studied ( only for the central reaction ) .",
    "the qgsm results of the latter distributions compare well with hydrodynamical assumptions for initial energy density profiles @xcite .",
    "these are similar in shape as well as in the order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the absolute values of @xmath12 drop rapidly when the system expands and the peaks get significantly washed out due to ongoing secondary collisions between the produced particles .",
    "but we want to emphasize that , although @xmath12 is rapidly decreasing in the transverse directions as well as in time , there definitely exist regions with local energy densities higher than the expected critical energy density for the qcd phase transition within the first @xmath51 .    however , at that time the system is not completely in local equilibrium , as it was elaborated in the second major topic .",
    "there the question whether and how fast the produced particles in ultra - relativistic au+au collisions equilibrate has been studied .",
    "it was shown that in both reactions , i.e. central and semi - peripheral ones , the longitudinal pressure is clearly dominating within the first @xmath29 .",
    "after the fast particles have left the central cell , all the three pressure components converge to each other .",
    "the next @xmath51 the transverse pressure is slightly stronger , not allowing the system to reach full local equilibrium but entering some kind of pre - equilibrium stage . as the central cell of the overlap zone is loosing more and more particles , it approaches almost local equilibrium after @xmath74 in the central collisions and @xmath99 in case of the semi - peripheral reactions . finally , the degree of local equilibration characterized by @xmath91 and its time evolution in the whole reaction ( @xmath89 ) plane shows in the central and semi - peripheral au+au collisions for all considered time steps a characteristic saddle structure , which indicates that the high density areas in front of the expanding system are far away from local equilibrium .",
    "only the inner cells tend towards kinetic equilibration .",
    "since the most secondary collisions happen within these high density areas , the most particle interactions take place in a non - equilibrated surrounding .",
    "global equilibrium is not reached at all  the global particle distributions are far from being isotropic for all time steps under consideration .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the question to what extent the produced matter reaches thermalization and how fast this may be achieved in the experiment is still open .",
    "our findings of almost full local equilibration at around @xmath81 together with the elliptic flow results and their time evolution obtained in the qgsm @xcite support the idea that fast thermal equilibration is not necessary to produce large elliptic flow , what contradicts somehow the usual hydrodynamical assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , a pre - equilibrium stage with energy densities well above the critical energy density is already achieved at early time scales .",
    "this means that the preconditions for a phase transition can be found within the string - cascade approach which , due to the lack of multi - string and/or multi - particle fusion processes , provides an upper limit for the equilibration times .    in this context , it is also important to stress , that all calculations are performed by averaging over 200 and 600 events for central and semi - peripheral reactions respectively . for a single collision event the energy density as well as local equilibrium is subject to strong fluctuations .",
    "it is not a priori clear to what extent these fluctuations may contribute to the final observables , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "this question together with a more detailed understanding of the freeze - out scenario for the hadron production and the influence of multi - string / particle reactions on equilibration deserves further investigations .",

    "<S> we study thermodynamic characteristica of ultra - relativistic au+au collisions at rhic energy @xmath0 within the framework of a microscopic transport model , namely the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution of the local energy density , transverse and longitudinal pressure and equilibration times are considered . in contrast to complete equilibration which is even in central reactions hardly achieved , pre - equilibrium stages with energy densities well above the critical energy density predicted by lattice qcd are established at short time scales . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding energy density profiles at proper time @xmath1 compare well with hydrodynamical assumptions for initial energy density distributions .    </S>",
