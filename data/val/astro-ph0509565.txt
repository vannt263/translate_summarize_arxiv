    "although many astrophysical and cosmological observations provide convincing evidence for the existence of a `` dark '' component in the matter density of the universe , the nature of this _ dark matter _ ( dm ) remains unkown .",
    "it is commonly assumed that dm is made of new , as yet undiscovered , particles , associated with theories beyond the standard model of particle physics . among the most widely studied candidates",
    "are the supersymmetric neutralino and candidates arising in theories with extra - dimensions , which appear difficult to constrain with direct searches ( i.e. by looking for nuclear recoils due to dm particles scattering off nuclei ) and whose prospects of discovery at future accelerators strongly depend on the details of the particle physics setup ( for recent reviews see e.g. refs .",
    "indirect searches via the detection of annihilation radiation may provide an interesting alternative , but they are usually affected by large astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , in many cases , the detection of an annihilation signal may be difficult to distinguish from less exotic astrophysical sources .",
    "an example of this is the case of the galactic center , where such high - energy radiation has been recently observed by several different experiments , without providing any conclusive evidence for or against an interpretation in terms of dm annihilation products ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    here",
    "we describe a scenario that may provide smoking - gun evidence for the annihilation of dm particles .",
    "if intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , with a mass ranging between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , exist in the galaxy , their adiabatic growth would have modified the dm distribution around them , leading to the formation of `` mini - spikes '' , that is , large , local enhancements of the dm density @xcite .",
    "the dm annihilation rate being proportional to the square of the number density of dm particles , these mini - spikes would be bright gamma - ray sources , distributed in a roughly spherically - symmetric way about the galactic center , and well within the observational reach of the next - generation gamma - ray experiments .",
    "their brightness and isotropy make them ideal targets of large field - of - view gamma - ray experiments such as glast  @xcite . in case of a positive detection , air cherenkov telescopes such as cangaroo  @xcite , hess  @xcite , magic  @xcite and veritas",
    "@xcite could extend the observations to higher energies and improve the angular resolution .",
    "we argue that the observation of numerous ( up to @xmath3 ) point - like gamma - ray sources with identical cut - offs in their energy spectra , at an energy equal to the mass of the dm particle , would provide smoking - gun evidence for dm particles .    in this paper , we make predictions for the number of detectable black holes in two different imbh formation scenarios . in the first scenario , imbhs form in rare , overdense regions at high redshift , @xmath4 , as remnants of population iii stars , and have a characteristic mass - scale of a few @xmath5 @xcite ( a similar scenario was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "these black holes serve as the seeds for the growth supermassive black holes found in galactic spheriods @xcite . in the second scenario ,",
    "imbhs form directly out of cold gas in early - forming halos , in a sense that will be specified below , and and are typified by a larger mass scale , of order @xmath6 .",
    "we demonstrate that , with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter scenario leads to qualitative differences in the mini - spike profiles with dramatic consequences for the detectability of gamma - ray fluxes . for both scenarios ,",
    "we make detailed estimates of the population of imbh in the milky way dm halo using a complete model of imbh formation at high redshift , black hole mergers , and halo merger and evolution @xcite .",

    "ii  a , we review the evidence and formation scenarios for imbhs . in sec .",

    "vi , we discuss the implications of our results and draw our conclusions .",
    "we perform all of our calculations in the context of a standard , flat cosmological constant plut cold dm ( @xmath7cdm ) cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum with a normalization set by @xmath11 .",
    "in the last few years , observational and theoretical evidence has accumulated  @xcite for the existence of compact objects , heavier than _ stellar _ black holes , but lighter than the so - called _ supermassive _ black holes ( smbhs ) lying at the centers of galactic spheroids .",
    "we consider here the mass range @xmath12 , where the lower bound of the imbhs mass corresponds to recent estimates of the maximum mass of the remnant of a massive stellar collapse  @xcite , and the upper limit roughly indicates the minimum mass of smbhs , assumed to lie in the range @xmath13 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "a hint of the existence of imbhs is provided by the detection of bright , x - ray , point sources , called ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , that are apparently not associated with active galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "although many known x - ray sources are associated with neutron stars and black holes , this intepretation fails in the case of ulxs .",
    "ulxs would have to emit radiation far above the eddington limit , if @xmath14 , and their positions in their host galaxies are not compatible with masses @xmath15 , because dynamical friction would cause these objects to sink to the centers of their hosts on a timescale shorter than a hubble time ( e.g. ref .",
    "accretion by imbhs has been advocated as a possible explanation  @xcite .",
    "another hint for the existence of imbhs , although not conclusive , comes from stellar kinematics in globular clusters  @xcite ; the observed relation between the mass and the velocity dispersion in selected globular clusters may fall on the extrapolation of the analogous relation for smbhs  @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", a population of massive seed black holes could help to explain the origin of smbhs .",
    "in fact , observations of quasars at redshift @xmath16 in the sloan digital survey  @xcite suggest that smbhs were already in place when the universe was only @xmath17 gyr old , a circumstance that can be understood in terms of rapid growth starting from massive seeds ( see e.g. ref .",
    "furthermore , the growth of smbhs through accretion and merging of heavy seeds may aid in the understanding some of the observed relationships between supermassive black hole masses and the properties of their host galaxies and halos  @xcite .",
    "scenarios that seek to explain the properties of the observed supermassive black hole population generally result in the prediction of a concomitant population of `` wandering '' imbhs throughout massive dm halos and the intergalactic medium  @xcite .",
    "however , despite their theoretical interest , it is difficult to obtain conclusive evidence for the existence of imbhs .",
    "a viable detection strategy could be the search for gravitational waves produced in the mergers of the imbh population  @xcite , which may become possible with the advent of space - based interferometers such as lisa .",
    "we focus here on two scenarios leading to the formation of black holes at very different mass scales . in the first scenario ( which we refer to as _ scenario a _ ) , black holes are remnants of the collapse of population iii ( or `` first '' ) stars  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the first stars may form when primordial molecular clouds with @xmath18 cool by formation and distruction of h@xmath19 into cold pockets at the centers of their dm halos , with typical densities of order @xmath20  @xmath21 and temperatures of order a few  @xmath22  k @xcite , and become gravitationally unstable .",
    "newtonian simulations suggest that the fate of pop  iii stars is very different from the case of their metal - enriched , comparably less massive counterparts mentioned above .",
    "zero metallicity pop  iii stars with masses in the range @xmath23 and @xmath24 collapse directly to black holes , stars with @xmath25 are completely disrupted due to the pulsation - pair - production instability , leaving behind no remnant , and again stars with masses @xmath24 collapse directly to black holes  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the evolution timescale of these very massive stars is typically of order @xmath26  myr .",
    "after this timescale , supernovae begin to explode , releasing energy and metals into the surrounding medium . in the standard picture of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", the metal - enriched material will be collected at later times at the centers of more massive haloes , where new generations of stars will form .",
    "interestingly , if a @xmath27 black hole forms halos that represent @xmath28 peaks of the smoothed density field , the resulting baryonic mass fraction in these objects would be comparable with the mass fraction in smbhs  @xcite . additionally , such a scenario leads to the natural prediction of a population of `` wandering '' black holes in the halos of milky way - sized galaxies , with masses similar to their initial mass scale @xmath29 , as many of the relatively small halos ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 fluctuations at @xmath32 ) that host early - forming black holes do not merge with the central galaxy , but orbit about the periphery of the halo @xcite .",
    "we stress that black holes in this scenario may not necessarily form at the very centers of their initial host dark matter halos at high redshift , a circumstance that , as we shall see , may have important consequences on the detectability of imbhs .    to represent the predictions of this class of black hole formation scenario where black holes form at @xmath33 from the remnants of the first stars",
    ", we use a model similar to that proposed by madau and rees  @xcite and studied in further detail by islam et al .",
    "@xcite and volonteri et al .",
    "specifically , at @xmath32 , we populate halos that constitute @xmath31 peaks in the smoothed primordial density field with seed black holes of initial mass  @xmath34 .",
    "we evolve these halos using an analytic model of halo growth that is focused on making many statistical realizations of the growth of a milky way - sized halo . after populating progenitor halos at high redshift with black holes",
    "as described above , these processes of halo growth and evolution are treated as described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these references for details and tests of the halo evolution models . for the purposes of this study ,",
    "we take the mass of the milky way halo to be @xmath35 and perform @xmath36 statistical realizations in order to ascertain the expected range of observable imbhs .",
    "the second scenario that we consider ( _ scenario b _ ) is based on the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite and it is representative of a class of models in which black holes originate from massive objects formed directly during the collapse of primordial gas in early - forming halos  @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "the initial black holes are massive ( @xmath37 ) and the growth of smbh proceeds in such a way that both mergers and accretion play an important role .",
    "we use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to represent the predictions of models that start smbh growth from very massive seeds . the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is as follows . during the virialization and collapse of the first halos , gas cools , collapses , and forms pressure - supported disks at the centers of halos that are sufficiently massive to contain a relatively large amount of molecular hydrogen (",
    "molecular hydrogen is the primary gas coolant in halos in the relevant mass range , see @xcite for a review ) . in halos that are both massive enough that molecular hydrogen cooling is efficient and which do not experience any major mergers over a dynamical time ,",
    "a protogalactic disk forms and can evolve uninterrupted .",
    "an effective viscosity due to local gravitational instabilities in the disk leads to an effective viscosity that transfers mass inward and angular momentum outward @xcite until supernovae in the first generation of stars heat the disk and terminate this process @xcite . by the time the process terminates ( of order the lifetimes of pop  iii stars ,",
    "@xmath38  myr ) , a baryonic mass of order @xmath37 loses its angular momentum and is transferred to the center of the halo .",
    "such an object may be briefly pressure - supported , but it eventually collapses to form a black hole @xcite .    the requirements that the early - forming host halo be massive enough to form an unstable disk and that the halo not experience a major merger imprints a typical mass scale for halos within which this process occurs of order @xmath39 .",
    "in this case the characteristic mass of the black hole forming in a halo of virial mass @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where we have assumed that a fraction @xmath42 is the fraction of the total baryonic mass in the halo that has fallen into the disk , @xmath43 is the redshift of formation , @xmath44 is that fraction of the baryonic mass which loses its angular momentum that remains in the remnant black hole , and @xmath45 is the timescale for the evolution of the first generation of stars @xcite . the distribution of black hole masses is a log - normal distribution with a mean given by the characteristic mass above and a standard deviation @xmath46 .",
    "the spread is determined by the spread in total angular momentum exhibited by halos of fixed mass in cosmological @xmath47-body simulations of dm halo formation @xcite .",
    "using the prescriptions of the koushiappas et al .",
    "@xcite model , we can again populate halos with black holes at high redshift and evolve them forward to determine the properties of satellite black holes in a statistically large sample of milky way - like halos at @xmath48 .",
    "this is precisely what was done in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to study the gravity wave background and we refer the reader to this work for further details . as with scenario",
    "a , we take the milky way halo to have mass @xmath49 at @xmath48 and construct @xmath36 realizations of wandering black hole populations in halos of this mass .      in the previous two sections , we outlined models for the production of imbhs in the early universe and evolution of imbhs in their host halos in the context of the hierarchical cdm model of structure formation .",
    "of course , as halos merge to form larger systems that eventually grow to the size of the milky way , black holes merge , producing supermassive , central black holes and perhaps a detectable gravity wave signal .",
    "these products have been the focus of most previous work regarding these models @xcite .",
    "consequently , these studies focused much attention on the merging of black holes as halos and galaxies merge . on the contrary , we are most interested in those pristine black holes that are orbiting within the milky way halo and have not merged with other black holes because these unmerged black holes may still reflect the properties of the dark matter density enhancement in which they formed .",

    "[ fig : radial ] the final mass spectrum ( i.e. at redshift @xmath48 ) of black holes in scenario b. as expected the distribution follow closely the initial mass spectrum , with a characteristic mass of order @xmath18 .",
    "the only deviation is that the overall distribution is slightly broadened by the fact that not all black holes form at the same redshift in halos of the same mass ( see eq .  [ [ eq : mbh ] ] and refs .",
    "the radial distribution of unmerged black holes is less trivial , and it would be more difficult to derive directly from the models of imbh formation at high redshift .",
    "the distribution is essentially set by the energy and angular momentum distributions of merging objects in a @xmath7cdm cosmology and dynamical friction ( e.g.  @xcite ) . unlike dark matter substructures , which are generally absent from the inner parts of the host halos ,",
    "because they tend to lose mass via tidal mass loss and heating , black holes and the surrounding dark matter distribution in the vicinity of the imbhs can survive tidal disruption to very small galactocentric distances .",
    "the final , cumulative radial distributions of unmerged imbhs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] .",
    "they are very similar for scenarios a and b ( though the normalization is different ) , and shows a behavior that scales as @xmath54 at large scales and tends toward a shallower slope on scales smaller than the scale radii of typical mw - size halos ( see the following section ) .     cumulative radial distribution of unmerged imbhs in the scenario a ( red ) and b ( black ) , for a milky way halo at z=0 .",

    "in each early - forming halo that hosts a seed black hole , when the black hole forms the dm distribution about the black hole inevitably reacts , adjusting to the new gravitational potential . this process has been studied extensively , particularly in the context of stellar cusps around massive black holes in clusters of stars or at the centers of galaxies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "gondolo and silk have applied this argument to the distribution of dm at the center of the galaxy  @xcite and introduced the term `` spike '' for the consequent enhancement in the dm density around the central smbh , in order to avoid confusion with dm `` cusps '' at the centers of halos in the _ cold _ dark matter model of structure formation .",
    "it was subsequently shown that dynamical processes like off - center formation of the seed black hole , or major merger events , may lead to destruction or reduction of the spike  @xcite . however , steeply rising stellar cusps in the innermost regions of galaxies suggest that such processes were not effective , at least in the case of the milky way , or that the stellar cusps were re - generated via star formation  @xcite or energy exchange between stars  @xcite .",
    "recently , bertone and merritt studied the evolution of dm spikes including gravitational scattering off stars and the self - annihilation of dm particles  @xcite , showing that the dm density in spikes is , indeed , substantially reduced by these effects , but the enhancement of the annihilation signal is still significant with respect to ordinary dm cusps .",
    "in the present study , we are interested in `` mini - spikes '' surrounding imbhs .",
    "because we track the merger history of each individual black hole , we can select precisely those black holes which never experienced mergers , to ensure that major mergers have not destroyed any cusp that existed around the original black hole .",
    "furthermore , the models we explore predict from between a few hundred to a few thousand black holes scattered throughout the milky way halo , and as the milky way has only @xmath55 luminous companions within @xmath56  kpc @xcite , we expect that the majority of the wandering black holes in our models reside in satellite halos with no significant stellar component .",
    "this implies that the effects of scattering off of stars should not significantly alter the dm distributions around the wandering imbhs .",
    "the mini - spikes around unmerged , wandering , imbhs are thus less sensitive to all of the dynamical processes that may have affected the spike at the galactic center .",

    "we assume that the black holes form over a timescale long enough to guarantee adiabaticity , but short compared to the cosmological evolution of the host halo ( in scenario b , both of these assumptions are built into the black hole formation model , see section  ii  b as well as our discussion below ) .",
    "adiabaticity requires that the formation time of the black hole is much larger than the dynamical timescale at a distance @xmath74 from the black hole , where @xmath74 is the radius of the sphere of gravitational influence of the black hole , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the velocity dispersion of dm particles at @xmath74 . in practice , we estimate @xmath74 by solving the implicit equation @xmath77 for a representative case in scenario b , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , this gives @xmath80 . in scenario",

    "this band includes the variation in spatial distributions of imbhs from one halo to the next as well as the variation in the individual properties of each imbh in each realization .",
    "although one would navely expect that the fluxes scale with @xmath133 , we note that the dm profile itself depends on @xmath134 and @xmath91 , more precisely on the ratio @xmath135 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rholim ] ) ] . the maximum density is higher for the pessimistic case , and this",

    "we have studied the detectability of gamma - rays from dm annihilations in mini - spikes around imbhs .",
    "the prospects of detection are summarized in figures  [ fig_detected ] and  [ fig_detectedpeak ] , where we show the number of imbhs that can be detected from experiments with point source sensitivity @xmath130 ( above 1 gev ) , as a function of @xmath130 .",
    "we found that the prospects of detection with glast are so promising that a large number of sources may be detected within its first year of operation .",
    "with respect to the case of a spike at the galactic center , searching for annihilation radiation from mini - spikes has the obvious disadvantage that imbhs are smaller than the smbh at the galactic center , and the mini - spikes grow from less dense initial profiles .",
    "however , there are also several advantages .",
    "first of all , it is likely that the vast majority of mini - spikes around _",
    "unmerged _ imbhs in the outer galactic halo are not affected by the dynamical processes that tend to destroy the central spike , or to decrease significantly the dm density near the black hole .",
    "for instance , they lack stellar cusps and are rarely affected by tidal interactions .",
    "furthermore , the prospects of detectability appear very promising and certainly less problematic than , say , annihilations from the galactic center .",
    "in fact , the gamma - ray background is strongest in the direction of the galactic center and substantially reduced when observations are performed off the disk and in particular at high galactic latitudes .",
    "there is even reason to believe that the number density of imbh may be _ enhanced _ at high galactic latitudes @xcite .    moreover ,",
    "there are several known gamma - ray sources in the direction of the galactic center , and the observation of a unique source , even coincident with the galactic center would not necessarily imply a dm annihilation origin . on the contrary ,",
    "the detection of tens or more gamma - ray sources with identical spectra , in particular identical cut - offs at the dm particle mass , and not associated with the galactic disk or other luminous companions of the milky way , would provide a smoking - gun signature of dm annihilations .    a natural place to search for imbhs may be the known dwarf satellite galaxies about the milky way ; however , the physics that govern the formation of these objects is still a topic of much debate and uncertainty , so such a search may be subject to the same drawbacks as searches for radiation near the center of the galaxy .",
    "however , as we have already stressed , these imbh formation scenarios have as a virtue that they predict that there may be hundreds of detectable objects within the galactic halo , most of which would not be associated with the known population of dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "an imbh population similar to the one in the milky way halo should be present in andromeda , given its similarity to the galaxy in terms of size and mass .",
    "moreover , the distance to the andromeda imbhs would be between @xmath142  kpc , amounting to a factor of only a few more in distance than to the black holes of the outer mw halo .",
    "hence the detection of such imbhs in andromeda may be possible in optimistic scenarios and may serve to demonstrate the ubiquity of such phenomena .    as a further implication",
    ", we found that the annihilation luminosity from any milky way - like halo may be dominated by annihilation around imbhs in optimistic scenarios .",
    "as an example , we showed that in scenario b , the total luminosity of an individual mini - spike , in terms of annihilation radiation , may be comparable to the luminosity of the entire host halo .",
    "therefore , such optimistic scenarios provide a significant `` boost factor '' for the gamma - ray background due to dm annihilations in halos at all redshifts ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparison between the prospects of indirect detection from the galactic center and the gamma - ray background ) , as well as an enhancement of anti - matter fluxes .",
    "a detailed study of these alternative indirect searches requires a full analysis of the redshift evolution of imbhs and spikes in halos of all masses in the former case , and of the propagation of anti - particles in the galaxy in the latter , and it is thus beyond the scope of this paper .    interestingly , the prospects of indirect detection in this scenario do not depend strongly on the particle physics parameters .",
    "in fact , while e.g. in the case of annihilations from the galactic center the annihilation flux is proportional to @xmath143 , the flux from mini - spikes is limited by the plateau in the number density due to dm annihilation itself for mini - spikes growing from @xmath120 profiles , we have shown that the annihilation flux is instead proportional to @xmath144 .",
    "finally , we stress that the detection of these sources would shed new light on the origin of imbhs and smbhs .",
    "mini - spikes appear to be ideal targets for large - field - of - view experiments such as glast .",
    "another promising experiment with a large field - of - view could be the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-02 ) instrument , if preliminary estimates of its sensitivity to gamma - rays are confirmed  @xcite .",
    "once the positions of the sources are determined , air cherenkov telescopes such as cangaroo  @xcite , hess  @xcite , magic  @xcite and veritas  @xcite may provide additional information , because of their better performance at higher energies and significantly better angular resolution .",
    "the determination of a common cut - off in the spectra ( possible only with acts for dm particles heavier than 300 gev ) will provide an estimate of the mass of the dm particle , while spectral features , such as annihilation lines or sharp edges , may provide important information on the nature of the dm particle .",
