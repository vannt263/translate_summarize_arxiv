    "one of the cornerstones of metallic physics is the concept of the fermi surface,@xcite the surface in momentum space separating filled states from empty ones at zero temperature . applying external perturbations , such as hydrostatic pressure , anisotropic strain , or a change in the chemical composition , the fermi surface can change its shape or more drastically its topology .",
    "this change of the fermi surface topology is usually referred to as a lifshitz transition,@xcite and has a profound impact on material properties.@xcite recently , the lifshitz transition has invoked revived interest in the context of cuprates,@xcite iron - arsenic superconductors,@xcite cold - atom systems,@xcite bi - layer graphene,@xcite and heavy - fermion metals and organic conductors.@xcite    it is known that a density wave instability can change the fermi surface topology . in the density wave ordered state , the fermi surface evolves with the strength of the coherent density wave potential .",
    "well - known examples are the underdoped cuprates . in the case of the electron - doped cuprates with commensurate @xmath0 spin - density wave order , it has been shown that the hole pockets around @xmath1 disappear as one tunes the magnitude of the density wave potential or the electron doping,@xcite as shown in figure [ fig : pd ] .",
    "( we take the in - plane lattice constant @xmath2 . )",
    "this is an example of the _ pocket - disappearing _",
    "lifshitz transition.@xcite another example of this type is found in the site - centered anti - phase stripe model , as shown in refs [ ] , where both the electron pocket and the hole pockets can disappear independently by tuning the strength of the spin and charge potentials .",
    "this pocket - disappearing lifshitz transition has important consequences for the hall effect.@xcite recently , it was realized that the _ neck - disrupting _ lifshitz transition is also possible in a stripe model for the underdoped cuprates,@xcite as shown in figure [ fig : nd ] , which provides a simple explanation for the disappearance of quantum oscillations and the associated diverging cyclotron mass in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5.@xcite            in the single - particle picture , the energy dispersion of band electrons @xmath6 has extrema in the first brillouin zone ( local maxima , local minima , and/or saddle points ) at energies denoted generically as @xmath7 . as the chemical potential @xmath8 is varied through @xmath7 , the fermi surface changes its topology and a lifshitz transition takes place ; for a local maximum or minimum , a pocket appears or disappears , corresponding to the pocket - disappearing type transition , and for a saddle point , the fermi surface changes its connection , corresponding to a neck - disrupting type transition .",
    "the cuprate band structure has saddle points located at @xmath9 in figure [ fig : pd].@xcite upon hole - doping , when @xmath8 reaches the energy of the saddle points , a neck - disrupting lifshitz transition occurs , characterized by a logarithmically divergent density of states .",
    "there have been extensive studies on the van hove singularity in the cuprate band dispersion , and its effects on material properties , as reviewed in ref [ ] . for the band structure",
    "obtained in ref [ ] , this lifshitz transition occurs at a relatively large hole doping . on the other hand , in the spin - density wave model , the neck - disrupting lifshitz transition can happen in the underdoped regime.@xcite    the electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction may modify the single - particle picture .",
    "in particular , the e - e interaction in cuprates is believed to be strong , and may hold the key to understanding the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity and other properties.@xcite here , we take the point of view in which the spin - density wave order is driven by the coulomb interaction .",
    "since the lifshitz transitions in figures [ fig : pd ] and [ fig : nd ] occur in states with well - established order ( corresponding to relatively large density wave potentials ) , we assume a fermi - liquid description for the electrons on the cuo@xmath3 planes.@xcite in the framework of the fermi liquid theory , the effect of e - e interaction on the lifshitz transition has been studied.@xcite in this paper , we concentrate on the effect of impurity scattering .",
    "to lowest order in the electron - impurity interaction , the impurity scattering rate is proportional to the single - particle density of states . in three dimensions ,",
    "the density of states acquires a @xmath10 non - analytic contribution in the vicinity of lifshitz transitions , which has important effects on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the system.@xcite the correction to the impurity scattering rate vanishes , albeit in a non - analytical way , as the transition is approached .",
    "the situation is different in two spatial dimensions , where for the pocket - disappearing type transition , the density of states has a finite jump , and for the neck - disrupting type , the density of states has a logarithmic singularity @xmath11.@xcite the logarithmically diverging density of states presents conceptual challenges ; it was pointed out that a system with diverging density of states at the fermi energy is unstable to density wave ordering.@xcite furthermore , when the impurity scattering is large , perturbation theory can not be applied .    in this paper , we study lifshitz transitions in two - dimensional systems , treating the impurity scattering in the self - consistent born approximation , and calculate the transport coefficients in the low - temperature limit .",
    "we keep both real and imaginary parts of the electron self - energy in solving the self - consistent equation . for the neck - disrupting type transition ,",
    "the divergence in the density of states is cut off by the impurity potential , and this approach leads to a conceptually consistent picture . restricting to the low - temperature limit allows us to study the impurity effects and neglect the scattering from phonons and other collective excitations .",
    "the corrections to the self - consistent born approximation consist of diagrams with crossed impurity lines , and as discussed in refs [ ] , they are negligible for the study of the electron self - energy .",
    "their contribution to two - particle processes , such as the weak localization effect,@xcite will not be considered .",
    "an external magnetic field suppresses the weak localization effect .",
    "a recent discussion on the localization effect from experimental point of view can be found in ref [ ] .",

    "we use a mean - field approximation for the spin - density wave state in underdoped cuprates , in which electrons move on a square lattice subject to additional periodic potentials due to density wave ordering .",
    "this results in a multi - band situation with a band dispersion depending on density wave potentials.@xcite close to the transition , this dependence can be neglected , and we assume a rigid band model . the chemical potential is the tuning parameter for the transition .    for impurity scattering , we assume point - like scatterers , such that the electron - impurity interaction matrix element is a constant in momentum space , denoted as @xmath13 . as a result ,",
