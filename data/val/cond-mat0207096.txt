    "at low temperature , the charge on an isolated metallic grain ( micronmetric dot ) is known to be quantized in units of the electron charge @xmath0 . even when the grain is weakly - coupled to a bulk lead , so that electrons can occasionally hop from the lead to the dot and back , the grain charge remains to a large extent quantized@xcite .",
    "this is commonly refered to as the coulomb blockade@xcite . in the opposite limit of perfect transmission between the reservoir and the dot , the average dot charge now",
    "depends ( in a continuous manner ) linearly on the applied gate voltage and the coulomb blockade disappears@xcite .",
    "however , matveev has shown that a crossover from the linear charge - voltage dependence to a _ coulomb - staircase _ function occurs for any finite backscattering from the quantum point contact ( qpc ) between the grain and the lead@xcite .",
    "the physics remains qualitatively unchanged by increasing the reflection amplitude at the qpc .",
    "furthermore , close to the steps , the charge exhibits a nonanalytic logarithmic dependence on the voltage due to the presence of _ two _ spin channels entering the dot , resulting in an underlying two - channel kondo model@xcite .",
    "note also that the coulomb blockade can be smeared out by applying an in - plane magnetic field@xcite .",
    "a direct measurement of the average grain charge , has been made possible using a single - electron transistor ( set ) which has a sensitivity well below a single charge as well as a small input capacitance @xcite .",
    "in particular , some of the predictions above have been checked experimentally and its superiority to conductance measurements of charge fluctuations demonstrated@xcite .    _ here , we investigate exotic coulomb staircases with fractional plateaus_.    the simplest system we consider comprises two _ large _ symmetric dots , which can be viewed as an artificial molecule , connected to a single reservoir via a single - mode qpc ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "for a recent review on artificial molecules built up with two dots , see ref .  .",
    "here , each dot is coupled with the same capacitance @xmath1 to a side - gate .",

    "similar to the _ conductance _",
    "peaks for two large dots tunnel - coupled to leads@xcite , we then observe that strong interdot charge fluctuations produce the _ halving _ of the capacitance peak period .",
