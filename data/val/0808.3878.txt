    "usually , these manifest themselves in the form of the outer disk bending away from the plane defined by the inner disk , defining either the shape of a bowl , or , more commonly , an integral sign as seen edge - on .",
    "this suggests that specific angular momentum of material in the warps is not aligned with that of the inner disk .",
    "numerous suggestions have been made over the years for the responsible mechanisms . among the earliest such proposals were internal bending modes in the disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( lynden - bell 1965 ) ) , but such modes were soon recognized to be persistent only in a disk with an unrealistically sharp mass truncation ( * ? ? ? * ( hunter & toomre 1969 ) ) .",
    "* revaz & pfenniger ( 2004 ) ) have revived this discussion by identifiying short - lived bending instabilities as a possible cause .",
    "other proposed mechanisms focus on the interaction of the baryonic disk with its environment : a bending of the outer baryonic disk may be introduced by a misalignment between the angular momentum of the inner baryonic disk and the hypothetical non - spherical , dark matter halo that it is embedded in ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ostriker & binney ( 1989 ) , jiang & binney ( 1999 ) , shen & sellwood ( 2006 ) ) consider the impact of ongoing accretion onto an outer dark matter halo and argue that , since the angular momentum of infalling material will in general not be aligned with the present galaxy disk , this will create an ongoing torque on the outer galaxy disk .",
    "* binney ( 1992 ) ) has furthermore suggested that , if infalling material loses angular momentum to the halo , it might penetrate as far as the outer edge of the baryonic disk itself .",
    "it is this hypothesis that we wish to test with the present work .",
    "how galaxies acquire gas is one of the key questions in our understanding of how they evolve , and determining whether warps are indeed signatures of such processes therefore is of great importance .",
    "how can the direct accretion hypothesis be tested ?",
    "the specific angular momentum vector of accreting material will , in general , neither be aligned exactly with that of the inner disk , nor have the same size .",
    "if such infalling material is indeed in direct contact and exchanging angular momentum with gas in the outermost baryonic disk , then it will introduce kinematic anomalies , i.e. , a deviation from disk - like rotation , such as a lag or excess in the circular velocity .",
    "measuring the circular velocity of gas in the warps therefore becomes an important observational discriminator .",
    "our project has measured line - of - sight velocities of gas in the outer disks of seven galaxies , the majority of which display clear signs of optical warps .",
    "our measurements were obtained via optical spectroscopy of the h@xmath3 line . although the tradititional way of observing gas in the outer disk is via the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen ,",
    "optical spectroscopy has proven a surprisingly successful alternative for studying the outer disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997;christlein & zaritsky 2008 ) ) , for a number of reasons : 1 ) most importantly , the spatial resolution  an order of magnitude better than even the highest - quality interferometric hi maps  allows us to clearly separate gas in the warps from gas in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to access galaxies with smaller angular diameters at larger redshifts , greatly increasing the number of suitable targets .",
    "2 ) sporadic local star formation or illumination of gas in the warps by escaping uv flux from the inner star - forming disk guarantee low - level h@xmath3 flux from the outer disk far beyond what is usually perceived as the star formation threshold .",
    "it has been demonstrated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997;christlein & zaritsky 2008 ) ) that multi - hour optical spectroscopy of such low - level emission can , in some cases , probe outer galaxy disks to similar extents as 21-cm .",
    "3 ) optical spectroscopy yields a plethora of ancillary data , particularly stellar continuum and metal lines .",
    "in determining the origin of gas in the outer disks and warps , metallicity indicators may provide valuable additional insight ( although an analysis exceeds the scope of these proceedings ) .",
    "our aim is to a ) measure the rotational velocity of gas in the warps and b ) determine whether there are kinematic anomalies in this rotational velocity , i.e. , sudden breaks or upturns that are not consistent with an extrapolation of the rotation curve from the inner disk , which may be associated with the onset of the warp .",
    "our sample consists of seven galaxies , of which six were taken from the catalog of optically warped galaxies by ( * ? ? ?",

    "all are nearly edge - on , with redshifts in the range of several thousand km / s , and their angular size is well - matched to the field of view .",
    "our observations were carried out over three nights in september 2007 , using fors2 on the vlt - ut1 .",
    "the typical observing strategy was to observe for a total of one hour with a long slit of 0.5@xmath4 width aligned along the major axis ( to obtain a reference for the rotational velocity and angular extent gas in the plane of the galaxy ) , then for two hours with a position angle offset from the major axis pa by a few degrees .",
    "the purpose of the latter observation was to assure that h@xmath3 emission emanating from the warps would be observed , rather than from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "sense and size of this offset were determined on a case - by - case basis after inspecting plates from the digitzed sky survey as well as our own acquisition images , and typically chosen so that the slit would pass within or just beyond the outermost contours of stellar continuum light at the end of the warp .",

    "the kinematics of the presumed warp gas are consistent with the extrapolation of the inner disk rotation curve .",
    "this sample is therefore not in support of the hypothesis that the outer , warped disks are in direct contact and exchanging angular momentum with material being newly accreted ; however , the possibility can not be ruled out yet that the real point of contact between the galaxy disk and accreted material lies at larger radii , and that the gas that we see at the onset of the optical warp has already settled into disk - like kinematics .",
    "we propose to explore three avenues for further investigation : ( i ) gas at larger radii , substantially beyond the optical warps , should be targetted ; ideally , targets should thus be selected on the basis of hi maps where available .",
    "( ii ) the sample should be increased in size from the present three clear detections .",
    "( iii ) additional indicators that might constrain the origin of the warp gas , in particular , metallicity , should be included in the analysis ."
