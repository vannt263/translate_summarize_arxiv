    "one of the most intriguing properties of lsco is the static incommensurate magnetic ordering observed at low temperature in _ elastic _ neutron scattering experiments .",
    "this ordering manifests itself as a scattering peak shifted with respect to the antiferromagnetic position . very importantly",
    ", the incommensurate ordering is a generic feature of lsco . according to experiments in the nel phase",
    ", the incommensurability is almost doping independent and directed along the orthorhombic @xmath9 axis  @xcite . in the spin - glass phase , the shift is also directed along the @xmath9 axis , but scales linearly with doping  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the underdoped superconducting region ( @xmath10 ) , the shift still scales linearly with doping , but it is directed along the crystal axes of the tetragonal lattice  @xcite .",
    "very recent studies reveal also the evolution of inelastic neutron spectra with doping  @xcite .    near @xmath11 certain la - based materials develop a strongly enhanced static incommensurate magnetic order accompanied by small lattice deformation at the second order harmonics  @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "incommensurate features have also been observed in inelastic neutron scattering from yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 ( ybco )  @xcite . in underdoped ybco",
    "there is a rather large uncertainty in the determining of the doping level .",
    "however , it seems that the incommensurability in ybco is about 30 - 40% smaller than that in lsco comparing the same doping level . in a very recent work  @xcite the electronic liquid crystal state in underdoped",
    "ybco has been reported .",
    "the state has no static spins , but nevertheless , it demonstrates a degeneracy with respect to the direction of the dynamic spin structure .",
    "in addition , there are indications that the electronic liquid crystal state observed in  @xcite is very close to a quantum phase transition to a state with static spins .",
    "the 2d @xmath15 model was suggested two decades ago to describe the essential low - energy physics of high-@xmath16 cuprates  @xcite . in",
    "its extended version , this model includes additional hopping matrix elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 to 2nd and 3rd - nearest cu neighbors .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath19 model on the square cu lattice has the form:@xmath20here , @xmath21 is the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath22 @xmath23 at site @xmath24 of the square lattice , @xmath25 indicates 1st- , @xmath26 2nd- , and @xmath27 3rd - nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath28 , and @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the number density operator .",
    "in addition to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) there is the constraint of no double occupancy , which accounts for strong electron correlations .",
    "the values of the parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) for lsco are known from neutron scattering  @xcite , raman spectroscopy  @xcite and ab - initio calculations  @xcite .",
    "the values are : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath35 , hence we measure energies in units of @xmath36 .",
    "the idea of spin spirals in the @xmath15 model at finite doping was first suggested in ref .",
    "the idea had initially attracted a lot of attention , see e. g. refs .",
    "however , it has been soon realized that there was a fundamental unresolved theoretical problem of stability of the spiral  @xcite .",
    "together with lack of experimental confirmations this was a very discouraging development .",
    "the observation of static and quasistatic incommensurate peaks in neutron scattering caused a renewal of theoretical interest in the idea of spin spirals in cuprates  @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that in lsco the charge disorder related to a random distribution of sr ions plays a crucial role and in the insulating state , @xmath37 , the disorder qualitatively influences the problem of stability of the spiral .",
    "the point is that in the insulating state the mobile holes are not really mobile , they are trapped in shallow hydrogen - like bound states near sr ions .",
    "the trapping leads to the diagonal spin spiral  @xcite .",
    "percolation of the bound states gives way to superconductivity and in the percolated state the spin spiral must be directed along crystal axes of the tetragonal lattice  @xcite .",
    "so the percolation concentration is @xmath38 .",
    "the rotation of the direction of the spin spiral is dictated by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the disorder at @xmath39 is still pretty strong .",
    "however , unlike in the insulating phase , the disorder does not play a qualitative role and therefore in the first approximation one can disregard it .",
    "thus , we arrive at the case of small uniform doping .",
    "this is the problem we address in the present work .",
    "as we already mentioned , the case of an uniform spin spiral ( no external disorder ) in a doped quantum antiferromagnet has an inherent theoretical problem .",
    "if considered in the semiclassical approximation , the out - of - plane magnon is marginal and in the end this implies an instability of the spin spiral  @xcite .",
    "an attempt to fix the problem by account of quantum fluctuations within the 1/s spin - wave theory was done in ref .",
    "we understand now that , while being qualitatively correct , the work  @xcite did not account for all relevant quantum fluctuations .",
    "the effective action method is much more powerful then the 1/s expansion because the method accounts for all symmetries exactly and generates a regular expansion in powers of doping x , this is the true chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this is why in the present work we employ the effective action method .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we discuss the effective low - energy action of the modified t - j model .",
    "section [ sec : neel ] addresses the issue of stability of the nel state under doping .",
    "the spiral ground state in the mean - field approximation is considered in section [ sec : spiral ] .",
    "the in - plane magnons are discussed in section [ sec : inspiral ] and out - of - plane magnons in section [ sec : outspiral ] .",
    "section [ sec : qpt ] addresses the quantum fluctuations and the quantum phase transition to the directional nematic .",
    "finally discussion and comparison with experiments is presented in the section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "at zero doping ( no holes ) , the @xmath40-@xmath36 model is equivalent to the heisenberg model and describes the mott insulator la@xmath12cuo@xmath3 .",
    "the removal of a single electron from this mott insulator , or in other words the injection of a hole , allows the charge carrier to propagate .",
    "single - hole properties of the @xmath40-@xmath36 model are well understood , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "a calculation of the hole dispersion at values of parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 corresponding to the single layer cuprate lsco has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the self consistent born approximation ( scba ) , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this calculation the dispersion of the hole dressed by magnetic quantum fluctuations",
    "has minima at the nodal points @xmath43 , and it is practically isotropic in the vicinity of each point , @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "we set the lattice spacing to unity , 3.81@xmath46 1 .",
    "the scba approximation gives @xmath47  .",
    "the effective mass corresponding to this value is approximately twice the electron mass and this agrees with recent measurement of shubnikov - de haas oscillations  @xcite . in the present work we use @xmath48 as a fitting parameter .",
    "we will see that to fit inelastic neutron data at @xmath49 we need @xmath50 this agrees well with the value obtained within the scba .",
    "the quasi - particle residue @xmath51 at the minimum of the dispersion is @xmath52  @xcite . in the full - pocket description , where two half - pockets are shifted by the af vector @xmath53",
    ", the two minima are located at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the system is thus somewhat similar to a two - valley semiconductor .",
    "the relevant energy scale for small uniform doping at zero temperature is of the order of @xmath56 , relevant momenta are also small , @xmath57 .",
    "hence , one can simplify the hamiltonian of the @xmath40-@xmath36 model by integrating out all high - energy fluctuations .",
    "this procedure leads to the effective lagrangian or effective action .",
    "the effective lagrangian has been first discussed quite some time ago  @xcite , see also a recent work  @xcite .",
    "that discussion resulted in the kinematic structure of the effective lagrangian valid in the static limit  @xcite .",
    "this limit is sufficient only for the mean - field approximation .",
    "the time - dependent terms that are necessary for excitations and quantum fluctuations have been derived only recently  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be written in terms of the bosonic @xmath58-field that describes the staggered component of the copper spins and in terms of fermionic holons @xmath59 .",

    "the kinematic structure of the coupling term was first derived in ref .",
    "the operator @xmath69 is a pseudospin that originates from the existence of two sublattices and @xmath70 is a unit vector orthogonal to the face of the mbz where the holon is located .",
    "kinetic energy of the holon , @xmath71 , is quadratic in the momentum @xmath72 and generally speaking it can be anisotropic .",

    ", there are also quartic in fermion operators terms in the effective lagrangian .",
    "however , these terms are not important at low doping and therefore we disregard them in ( [ eq : ll ] ) .    the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : ll ] ) is valid regardless if the @xmath58-field is static or dynamic . in other words it does not matter if the ground state expectation value of the staggered field is nonzero , @xmath77 , or zero , @xmath78 .",

    "we would like to stress once more that spin and charge to some extent are separated in the effective low - energy lagrangian ( [ eq : ll ] ) , this is why we use the term `` holon '' instead of `` hole '' .",

    "this analysis has to include an explanation of a smaller incommensurability compared to that observed in the single layer lsco .    in the present work we did not account for the superconducting pairing .",
    "the point is that at low doping the pairing practically does not influence magnetic excitations .",

    "the spin - wave exchange mechanism for pairing of holons was suggested in refs .",
