    "the mimac collaboration ( santos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) aims at building a directional dark matter detector composed of a matrix of pixelised micromegas detectors .",
    "directional detection requires the measurement of both 3d track and energy of recoiling nuclei ( ahlen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; billard _ et al . _",
    "the recoil energy measurement is in this case a challenging issue as the scattering of a dark matter particle produces , in most cases , a few kev recoiling nucleus .",
    "the energy released by a particle in a medium produces in an interrelated way three different processes :    1 .",
    "ionization , producing a number of electron - ion pairs , 2 .",
    "scintillation , producing a number of photons through de - excitation of quasimolecular states 3 .",
    "heat produced essentially by the motion of nuclei and electrons .",
    "the fraction of energy given to electrons has been estimated theoretically by ( linhard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and may be simulated by the srim monte carlo code ( j.  ziegler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . the ionization quenching factor ( iqf )",
    "is defined as the fraction of energy released through ionization by a recoil in a medium compared with its kinetic energy .",
    "measuring iqf , especially at low energies , is a key point for dark matter detectors , since it is needed to evaluate the nucleus recoil energy and hence the wimp kinematics .    in the last decades",
    "an important effort has been made to measure the iqf in different materials : gases ( verbinski & giovannini @xcite ) , solids ( jones & kraner @xcite , gerbier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and liquids ( aprile _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , using different techniques .",
    "the use of a mono energetic neutron beam has been explored in solids with success ( jageman _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 , simon _",
    "however in the low energy range the measurements are rare or absent for many targets ( e.g. helium or @xmath1 ) due to ionization threshold of detectors and experimental constraints .",
    "our motivation for this work is to obtain the best reconstruction of the detected nuclear recoil energy in low pressure gaseous dark matter search experiments .",
    "the iqf can be determined by measuring the ionization produced by a nuclear recoil of a known energy in the target material .",
    "we have developed an experimental setup devoted to the measurement of low energy ( kev ) ionization quenching factor .",
    "the experimental set - up is the following : an electron cyclotron resonance ion source ( ecri ) ( geller @xcite ) with an extraction potential from a fraction of kv up to 50 kv , is coupled to a micromegas detector via a 1 @xmath0 m hole with a differential pumping .",
    "this setup allows measurements from few mbar to 1 bar .",
    "gas in the plasma chamber with 20 kv as extraction potential ]    the ecri ion source ( electron cyclotron resonace source ) ( fig .",
    "[ ecri ] ) is a plasma device designed and built by the lpsc ion source team to provide charged ions at low velocities from a fraction of kev to 50 kev .",
    "one of the main features of this facility is the availability of very low and stable currents of a few pa . in the current configuration ,",
    "the beam is adapted to the 45 degrees spectrometer by an einzel lens . a micrometer aperture ( 1 @xmath2 in diameter )",
    "selects a part of this beam which is injected in the micromegas detector and allows a rate of about 25 ions per second .",
    "depending to the gas injected in the plasma chamber , the source is able to produce many type of beams : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6,@xmath7 and to separate the desired ion species ( fig .",
    "[ spectrsource ] ) .",
    "the ions energy have been previously checked by time - of - flight measurements . a 50 nm thick silicon nitride membrane ( @xmath8 )",
    "was used as interface to produce low energy electrons that has been detected by a first channeltron .",
    "a second channeltron was used to detect ions for six different known positions .",
    "this setup allowed to measure the energies of the ions just after the foil . with this configuration ( silicon nitride membrane interface ) , a first energy measurement with micromegas",
    "was performed .",
    "consequently , we could verify that the energy measured by tof were consistent with the extraction potential values in kv for the 1 + state of charge of ions with the 1 @xmath2 diameter aperture interface .       at 1000 mbar to fluorescence x - rays .",

    "the active area is @xmath9 .",
    "the gap between the copper anode and stainless steel mesh is maintained by cylindrical pillars every 2  mm .",
    "this gap is well adapted for gas pressure between 350 and 1300 mbar with helium and 50 mbar with @xmath1 .",
    "the drift distance between the cathode and the mesh is 4 cm , which is large enough to include the tracks of nuclei of energies up to 50 kev at 350 mbar .",
    "these tracks , of the order of 6 mm for 50 kev , are roughly of the same length than the electrons tracks produced by a 6 kev x - rays .",
    "we used an individual power supply for each electrode ( mesh and anode ) with cathode drift to the ground , allowing to independently vary the different fields . for coupling reasons with the ion source , the @xmath10 hole interface ( cathode )",

    "a standard @xmath11 x - ray source providing the 5.9 kev x - rays has also been used for calibration .",
    "the signals from the micromegas anode were processed by the analogue readout composed of a dedicated charge sensitive pre - amplifier and of a commercial spectroscopy amplifier . due to the low drift velocity of electron in such a low drift field ( 80 v / cm in helium mixture ) , the decay time constant of this pre - amplifier is large enough ( few hundred @xmath12 ) to ensure a total collection charge and an output proportional to the total energy of the event .",
