    "this paper explores the use of space  time point process models for the short - term forecasting of wildfire hazard in los angeles county , california .",
    "the region is especially well suited to such an analysis , since the los angeles county fire department and department of public works have collected and compiled detailed records on the locations burned by large wildfires dating back over a century .",
    "the landscape in los angeles county is uniquely vulnerable to high intensity crown - fires , largely because the predominant local vegetation consists of dense , highly flammable contiguous chaparral shrub [ keeley ( @xcite ) ] . in addition , the dry summers and early autumns in los angeles county are typically followed by high winds known locally as santa ana winds [ keeley and fotheringham ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "these offshore winds reach speeds exceeding 100 kph at a relative humidity below 10% , and are annual events lasting several days to several weeks , creating the most severe fire weather in the united states [ schroeder et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .    in order to forecast wildfire hazard",
    ", the united states national fire danger rating system ( nfdrs ) , created in 1972 , produces several daily indices that are designed to aid in planning fire control activities on a fire protection unit [ deeming et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; bradshaw et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; burgan ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "these include the occurrence index , the burning index ( bi ) , and the fire load index .",
    "these indices are derived from three fire behavior components  a  spread component , an energy release component , and an ignition component , that are in turn computed based on fuel age , environmental parameters ( slope , vegetation type , etc . ) , and meteorological variables such as wind , temperature , and relative humidity .",
    "local wildfire management agencies may combine these components in different ways or calibrate the inherent parameters to adapt the system to the local environment for wildfire hazard assessment .",
    "fire managers use this information in making decisions about the appropriateness of prescribed burning or alerts for increased preparedness , both in terms of fire suppression staffing and fire prevention activities .",
    "since fireline intensity is an important factor in predicting fire containment and the likelihood of fire escape , the burning index is the rating of most interest to many fire managers [ schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .",
    "this is especially the case for natural crown - fire ecosystems such as southern california shrublands , where bi is commonly employed to assess fire danger [ mees and chase ( @xcite ) ] . indeed , in los angeles county , as well as at least @xmath0 of counties nationwide ,",
    "the bi is the index primarily used by fire department officials as a measure of overall wildfire hazard , and its use has been justified largely based on its observed empirical correlation with wildfire incidence and burn area in different regions [ haines et al.(@xcite ) ; haines , main and simard ( @xcite ) ; mees and chase ( @xcite ) ; andrews , loftsgaarden and bradshaw ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "however , several recent investigations have shown that the bi is far from an ideal predictor of wildfire incidence in los angeles county ; schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that a simple point process model , which used only the same weather variables as those incorporated by the bi , vastly outperformed the bi in terms of predictive efficacy in los angeles county , using historical data from 19772000 .",
    "in fact , the simple model in schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) not only offered improvement in terms of likelihood scores such as the akaike information criterion ( aic ) , but the study suggested that substantial improvement in short - term forecasting could be achieved by the simple model using the weather variables directly , compared to a point process model that interpolates bi measurements .    here , we adopt the same basic modeling framework of schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but extend the models in two important ways .",
    "first , we consider not only daily weather variables but also additional covariates with management relevance , such as historical spatial burn patterns and wind direction , using the directional kernel regression method described in schoenberg and xu ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , unlike the simple models of mees and chase ( @xcite ) and schoenberg et al . ( @xcite )",
    "that average daily weather variables over weather stations within los angeles county , here we explore models that interpolate the records from different weather stations , weighting these data based on their spatial distance from the location where wildfire hazard is to be estimated .",
    "thus , the models considered here should have more direct relevance for forecasting wildfire hazard in precise spatial locations within los angeles county , compared to previous work that essentially averaged weather variables and hazard estimates over los angeles county as a whole . as with schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , our results are compared with models using the bi measurements recorded at each of the weather stations , so that the effectiveness of the bi in summarizing the wildfire hazard as a function of the weather variables may be assessed .    while alternative models may be more useful for forecasting long - term wildfire hazard , that is ,  estimating the number of wildfires occurring within a month , season , or year , the focus here is on forecasting short - term wildfire hazard , that is ,  the probability of a wildfire occurring within a specific day . to compare the overall performance of the models considered , we employ diagnostics including likelihood - based numerical summaries such as the akaike information criterion ( aic ) , as well as power diagrams summarizing the predictive efficacy of each model for short - term forecasting .",
    "residual analysis is also used to highlight specific areas and times where the performance of a model is poor and to suggest areas for improvement .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] describes the wildfire and weather data that are used in the analysis .",
    "the models used , as well as methods for their estimation , are outlined in section [ sec3 ] , and methods for goodness - of - fit assessment are discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "section [ sec5 ] presents the main results , and a discussion is given in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "los angeles county is an ideal test site for models for wildfire hazard , with detailed wildfire data having been collected and compiled by various agencies , including the los angeles county fire department ( lacfd ) and the los angeles county department of public works , the santa monica mountains recreation area , and the california department of forestry and fire protection .",
    "regional records of the occurrence of wildfires date back to 1878 , and include information on each fire , including its origin date , the polygonal outline of the resulting area burned , and the centroidal location of this polygon .",
    "lacfd officials have noted that the records prior to 1950 are believed to be complete for fires greater than @xmath1  km@xmath2 ( 100 acres ) , and data since 1950 are believed to be complete for fires burning greater than @xmath3  km@xmath2 , or 10 acres [ schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] . as in schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , our analysis in this paper is focused primarily on models for the occurrences of the 592 wildfires burning at least 0.0405  km@xmath2 recorded between january 1976 and december 2000 .",
    "the daily burn area is highly right - skewed and closely follows the tapered pareto distribution [ schoenberg , peng and woods ( @xcite ) ] . for further details , images of the spatial locations of these wildfires , and information about missing data ,",
    "see peng , schoenberg and woods ( @xcite ) .",
    "since 1976 , daily meteorological observations from the remote automatic weather stations ( raws ) were archived across the united states .",
    "the analysis here is based on sixteen raws located within los angeles county , california .",
    "the raws record daily measures of many meteorological variables , including air temperature , relative humidity , precipitation , wind speed , and wind direction [ warren and vance ( @xcite ) ] . summaries of these records are collected daily at 1300 hr and transmitted by satellite to a central archiving station .",
    "these daily raws data are used as inputs by the nfdrs in order to construct fire behavior components that are in turn combined to construct the bi .",
    "it should be noted that data were missing on certain days for several of the 16 raws , though the biases resulting from such missing data are likely to be small ; see peng , schoenberg and woods ( @xcite ) for details .",
    "we follow previous research including schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in modeling the catalog of wildfire centroids in los angeles county as a realization of a point process that may depend on daily meteorological variables .",
    "we begin with a basic reference model using merely a spatial background rate and seasonal component , and a model using the burning index in addition to the spatial and seasonal background rates .",
    "we then introduce competing models that use daily meteorological variables recorded at the raws , and extend the research of schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) by including additional covariates , such as wind direction and fuel age .",
    "further , instead of averaging daily weather variables or the burning index over all weather stations within los angeles county , here we explore methods of obtaining an estimated spatial intensity at any location @xmath4 on any particular day by interpolating the meteorological variables from different weather stations , weighting each record based on its distance from the location @xmath4 in question .      a spatial - temporal point process @xmath5 is mathematically defined as a random measure on a spatial - temporal region @xmath6 , taking values in the nonnegative integers @xmath7 or infinity [ daley and vere - jones ( @xcite ) ] . in this framework",
    "the measure @xmath8 represents the number of points falling in the subset @xmath9 of @xmath6 . since any analytical spatial - temporal point process is characterized uniquely by its associated conditional rate ( or intensity ) @xmath10 , assuming it exists , modeling of such point processes is typically performed by specifying a parametric model for this rate . for the case",
    "where the spatial region is planar , for any point @xmath11 in time and location @xmath12 in the plane , the conditional rate is defined as a limiting frequency at which events are expected to occur within time range @xmath13 and rectangle @xmath14 , conditional on the prior history , @xmath15 , of the point process up to time @xmath11 . for references on space  time point processes and conditional rates , see , for example ,  daley and vere - jones ( @xcite ) or schoenberg , brillinger and guttorp ( @xcite ) .",
    "given a parametric function for @xmath16 , estimates of the parameters @xmath17 may be obtained by maximizing the log - likelihood function [ see schoenberg , brillinger and guttorp ( @xcite ) , page  1576 , or daley and vere - jones ( @xcite ) , page  232 , equation  7.24 ] : @xmath18 \\,dn(t , x , y ) - \\int^{t_1}_{t_0 } \\int_x \\int_y \\lambda(t , x , y ; , \\theta ) \\,dy \\,dx \\,dt \\\\ & = & \\sum^n_{i=1 } \\log \\lambda(t_i , x_i , y_i ; \\theta ) - \\int^{t_1}_{t_0 } \\int_x \\int_y \\lambda(t , x , y ; \\theta ) \\,dy \\,dx \\,dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of a poisson process , the intuition behind this formula is that @xmath19 reflects the likelihood associated with the observed events , and @xmath20 represents the probability of no events in any _ other _ portions of the spatial - temporal region , the full likelihood is the product of these two terms , and the logarithm of this product yields @xmath21 above . under",
    "rather general conditions , the maximum likelihood estimates ( mles ) are consistent , asymptotically normal , and efficient [ ogata ( @xcite ) ] , and estimates of their variance can be derived from the negative of the diagonal elements of the inverse hessian of the likelihood function [ ogata ( @xcite ) , rathbun and cressie ( @xcite ) ] . in most cases , explicit solutions for mles",
    "are not available and iterative numerical optimization methods are used instead .      in this analysis",
    "we explore several spatial - temporal point process models for predicting wildfire occurrence rates . as an initial baseline model , one may consider an inhomogeneous poisson process , where the conditional intensity at time @xmath11 and at location @xmath12 depends only on the season associated with time @xmath11 , as well as the background rate @xmath22 of wildfires for the location in question .",
    "that is , one may consider a baseline model such as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are parameters to be estimated in modeling fitting .",
    "parametric or nonparametric methods can be used to estimate the seasonal pattern @xmath26 and spatial background @xmath22 .",
    "while nonparametric methods can be especially flexible for estimating complex patterns such as spatial burn averages , a possible drawback to such methods is their potential for overfitting , particularly when the same data are used for fitting and evaluation of the fit of the model . as in schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we propose estimating the spatial background @xmath22 for fires between 19762000 by kernel smoothing the centroidal locations of wildfires recorded during the previous 25 years , that is ,  from january 1950 to december 1975 .",
    "that is , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a kernel function , @xmath29 is a bandwidth to be estimated in modeling fitting , @xmath30 indicates the spatial coordinates of the @xmath31th wildfire between 1950 and 1975 , @xmath32 is the number of observed 19511975 wildfire occurrences , and @xmath33 is the euclidian distance between @xmath12 and @xmath34 .",
    "standard kernel functions can be used , and attention is usually limited to functions that are unimodal , symmetric about zero , and that integrate to  1 , such as the gaussian density of the epanechnikov kernel [ hrdle ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "it is well known that the results are far more sensitive to the choice of bandwidth than the choice of kernel function , and much research has focused on automated methods for choosing bandwidth parameters , including cross - validation , penalty functions , and plug - in methods [ silverman ( @xcite ) ; hrdle ( @xcite ) ] . here , since the data @xmath30 used in the estimation of @xmath22 is distinct from that used in the rest of the model fitting and in the evaluation , the problem of overfitting is far less severe , and the bandwidth parameter may simply be fitted by maximum likelihood .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an estimate of the spatial background rate @xmath22 , with bandwidth estimated by maximum likelihood .",
    "one sees the general pattern of fire activity in los angeles county during 19511975 , with most fires occurring in the angeles national forest , as well as parts of the los padres national forest and the santa monica mountains , while many other wildfires were located in or near buckweed , santa clarita , and glendale , california .",
    ", with centroid locations of wildfires occurring during 18781976 .",
    "( the spatial bandwidth @xmath29 is 0.6 miles ) . ]",
    "helmers , magku and zitikis ( @xcite ) propose a kernel - based estimate for the consistent estimation of a seasonal time series . here , in order to safeguard against overfitting , we propose estimating the seasonal pattern @xmath26 describing the overall seasonal variation of wildfire activity in a fashion similar to that used for the spatial background rate , that is ,  by kernel smoothing the times of wildfires during _ previous _ years : @xmath35 in the above equation , @xmath36 represents the date within the year associated with time @xmath11 , that is ,  @xmath36 is the number of days since the beginning of the year for time @xmath11 , @xmath37 is the time of the @xmath31th wildfire occurrence in the data set ( 19501975 ) , and @xmath38 is a bandwidth parameter to be estimated .",
    "a  wrapped kernel function @xmath28 should be used so that , for instance , january  1 and december 31 are treated as one day apart . the bandwidth may be estimated by maximum likelihood , fitting the kernel smoothing of the 19501975 data to the 19762000 data set .",
    "this procedure may be preferable for relatively small data sets such as the one considered here in order to prevent overfitting .     for model ( [ eqn : model1 ] ) , using kernel regression with a wrapped gaussian kernel and bandwidth @xmath39 days , estimated by mle . ]",
    "figure [ fig2 ] displays the smoothed function @xmath26 applied to wildfire incidence in los angeles county from january 1950 to december 1975 , with bandwidth estimated by mle by fitting the resulting function to wildfire data from 19762000 .",
    "it is evident that the mean number of wildfires is highest between july and october and rapidly decreases during november and december , reaching its minimum in january and february .",
    "schoenberg et al .  ( @xcite ) pointed out that the burning index typically assumes moderate values in december , january , and february , though few wildfires occur during these months .      to evaluate the potential of the burning index ( bi ) in predicting wildfire incidence",
    ", one may consider a model such as @xmath40 for some function @xmath41 which interpolates the bi records at time @xmath11 and location @xmath42 , since bi records are only available at fixed raws sites .",
    "different methods of interpolation are possible .",
    "one possibility is to average the bi records on day @xmath11 , weighing each by the distance between the raws and the location @xmath42 in question .",
    "that is , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bi value recorded at time @xmath11 from the @xmath45th station , @xmath46 are the coordinates of the @xmath45th station , @xmath47 represents the collection of stations for which bi records are available on day @xmath11 , and @xmath48 is a normalizing constant given by @xmath49      as an alternative to the model ( [ eqn : model2 ] ) incorporating bi measurements , one may instead consider examining the direct impact on wildfire hazard estimates of meteorological variables used in the computation of the bi , by replacing the function @xmath41 in ( [ eqn : model2 ] ) by functions of the meteorological variables themselves .",
    "that is , one may consider models such as @xmath50 where @xmath51 takes into account the contribution of temperature ( @xmath52 ) , relative humidity ( @xmath53 ) , wind speed ( @xmath54 ) , and precipitation ( @xmath55 ) at time @xmath11  from each raws where the data are available .    since nonlinearities have been detected in the dependence of burn area on climatic variables [ schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] , one may wish to avoid simple averaging of the meteorological variables in estimating wildfire hazard .",
    "instead , one option is to describe the association between each climatic variable and wildfire burn area by an explicit function @xmath56 and weight the information from each raws by the distance to the point @xmath42 to be estimated using kernel smoothing .",
    "this suggests a model such as @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are records of temperature , relative humidity , directed wind speed , and precipitation , respectively , on day  @xmath11 at the @xmath45th raws , the parameters @xmath62 , and @xmath63 represent weights associated with these meteorological variables , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are bandwidths to be estimated , and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are normalizing constants .    note that the bandwidth parameters are somewhat different here than in ordinary kernel regression models . while ordinarily in kernel regression or kernel density estimation bandwidth parameters may not typically be estimated by maximum likelihood because the likelihood would tend to increase as the bandwidth shrinks to 0 [ silverman ( @xcite ) ] , here this is not the case .",
    "instead , the bandwidth parameters @xmath68 , and @xmath69 in model ( [ eqn : model3 ] ) merely control the spheres of influence of the relative weather stations in terms of the impact of each on wildfire hazard .",
    "that is , if @xmath70 is small , for instance , then each raws station s recorded temperature will affect the wildfire incidence more locally , whereas if @xmath70 is very large , then the wildfire hazard at any particular location will depend more closely on the average temperature throughout los angeles county .    . ]",
    "functional forms can be suggested for @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , by individually examining the empirical relationship between daily area burned and each of these variables . in order to smooth these relationships",
    ", one possibility would be to use local linear regression or segmented regression , since the relationships between wildfire burn area and temperature , precipitation , and other weather variables appear to have thresholds [ schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .",
    "another possibility is to use kernel regression of daily area burned on the average temperature , relative humidity , and precipitation over all raws , respectively .",
    "for instance , the impact of temperature may be estimated via @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the area burned on the @xmath31th day during 19762000 , @xmath75 is the average temperature readings over all raws on that day , @xmath76 is the bandwidth of the kernel regression which can be selected by methods such as cross - validation or the plug - in method [ silverman ( @xcite ) ] , and @xmath77 is the number of days with records during this period .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] displays such kernel regression estimates of @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath72 .",
    "not surprisingly , one sees that daily area burned generally increases as temperature increases , and decreases as relative humidity and precipitation increase , though some local fluctuations are seen in the kernel regressions on temperature and relative humidity .",
    "these fluctuations are likely attributable to the high variability of the estimates due to the relatively small sample of large fires contained in the catalog .",
    "special care should be taken in estimating @xmath80 , since wind is directional , and this direction may provide important information related to wildfire incidence . one possible way to estimate the relationship between daily area burned and directional wind speed is via directional kernel regression , as outlined in schoenberg and xu ( @xcite ) .",
    "an example of a two - dimensional directional kernel is the von mises distribution suggested by mardia and jupp ( @xcite ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the modified bessel function of the first kind and order 0 , @xmath83 is the directional center , and @xmath84 is known as the concentration parameter . following schoenberg and xu ( @xcite ) , the corresponding two - dimensional kernel regression function @xmath80 would then be estimated via @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 represent the mean wind speed and wind direction , respectively , on day @xmath31 .",
    "cross - validation can be used to optimize the estimates of  @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and  @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] displays a kernel regression estimate of the relationship between daily burning area and daily mean wind direction , weighted by wind speed , averaged over all @xmath91 raws stations .",
    "the sharp increase in mean wildfire burn area , indicated by darker shading in figure [ fig4 ] , is very strongly associated with higher wind speeds .",
    "in addition , one sees from figure [ fig4 ] the extent to which winds from the northeast , which are often warm , dry santa ana winds , are associated with higher burn areas . since the impact on average wildfire burn area of wind direction might be different at distinct weather stations , one might wish to estimate @xmath91 distinct kernel regression functions  @xmath92 , one for each raws station @xmath45 .",
    "the model ( [ eqn : model3 ] ) described above is additive in each of the weather variables , implying that an extreme value in only one weather variable may lead to a high estimate of wildfire hazard on the corresponding day , which might be questionable .",
    "for instance , one would expect few large wildfires occur on days when temperatures are extremely high yet there is some moderate amount of precipitation and relative humidity .",
    "an alternative approach is to use a multiplicative component instead , where once again @xmath93 where now the fire weather @xmath94 term has the multiplicative form @xmath95      in both model ( [ eqn : model3 ] ) and model ( [ eqn : model4 ] ) , @xmath96 , and @xmath72 may be estimated using kernel regression of burn area on average temperature , relative humidity , and precipitation over all weather stations , where each station has the same regression function .",
    "however , because of differences in the locations of the weather stations , including differing altitudes of these stations , some stations may have lower average temperatures or higher relative humidities than others throughout the year .",
    "hence , a particular temperature and relative humidity at one station might indicate a  very different wildfire hazard than the same values observed at a different raws station . in order to deal with this ,",
    "one may estimate distinct kernel regression curves for each raws in model ( [ eqn : model3 ] ) and model ( [ eqn : model4 ] ) .",
    "that is , one might consider @xmath97 where @xmath98 or @xmath99 where @xmath100 the kernel regression functions such as @xmath101 for each station @xmath45 may be estimated as in models ( [ eqn : model3 ] ) and ( [ eqn : model4 ] ) , that is ,  by kernel regression of the total daily burn area in los angeles county against the temperature at station  @xmath45 .",
    "one may further improve the models by adding fuel age as a covariate .",
    "fuel age , or its proxy , the time since the location s last recorded burn , appears to have a nonlinear , threshold - type relationship with burn area [ peng and schoenberg ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "indeed , burn area appears to increase steadily with fuel age up to ages of approximately 2030 years [ peng and schoenberg ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "this suggests incorporating the contribution of fuel age into model ( [ eqn : model5 ] ) by a truncated linear function , that  is , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the fuel age at the space ",
    "time pixel @xmath104 , and where  @xmath105 is an upper truncation time .",
    "fuel age may be incorporated similarly into model ( [ eqn : model6 ] ) as well : @xmath106",
    "equations ( [ eqn : model1])([eq8 ] ) describe eight point process models that may be used to predict wildfire hazard at any time and location within los angeles county . in order to compare the performance of these models ,",
    "one commonly used method is the akaike information criterion ( aic ) , which is defined as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the log - likelihood and @xmath109 is the number of fitted parameters in the model .",
    "smaller values of aic indicate better fit .",
    "the aic makes a good trade - off between model complexity and overfitting by rewarding a higher likelihood while penalizing the addition of more parameters [ akaike ( @xcite ) ] .    the predictive capacity of competing point process models",
    "may also be compared by examining the models performance on the 19762000 wildfire data , as suggested in schoenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "consider a grid of space  time cells , with each cell s center separated by some distance @xmath110 in space and a temporal distance @xmath111 , and let these cells represent locations and times where alarms may potentially be issued .",
    "for any such space  time point @xmath104 , one may compute the estimated conditional intensity @xmath112 for a particular model . consider issuing an alarm if the value of @xmath113 is above some certain threshold .",
    "we say the alarm is successful if a wildfire occurs within the cell ; otherwise , it is a false alarm .",
    "the false positive rate of the alarms , defined as the proportion of cells without wildfires where @xmath114 exceeded the alarm threshold , can be compared to the true positive rate , that is ,  the proportion of wildfires occurring in cells where @xmath114 exceeded the alarm threshold , using traditional receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves .",
    "each possible alarm threshold represents a single point on the roc curve , and the resulting curve summarizes the potential efficacy of a model in forecasting wildfires .",
    "while numerical likelihood scores such as aic and roc curves can be useful in evaluating the overall performance of a point process model , neither method is useful at identifying particular times and locations where a model fits poorly or suggesting ways in which a model might be improved . for these purposes , it is useful to inspect plots of residuals , which may be defined as the difference between the number of events occurring in a certain space  time interval and the integral of the estimated conditional intensity over the same interval [ baddeley et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .",
    "negative residuals indicate overestimates of wildfire hazard , and very large residuals indicate places and times where the model underestimated wildfire hazard .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for the models ( [ eqn : model1])([eq8 ] ) are listed in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] . in tables",
    "[ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , the parameter  @xmath105 was fixed at 22 years for models 7 and 8 , based on peng and schoenberg ( @xcite ) ; this parameter was also fit by maximum likelihood , yielding very similar results , so , for simplicity , here we report the fit of the model with  @xmath105 fixed at 22 years .",

    "for instance , for a false positive rate fixed at @xmath122 , model ( [ eq8 ] ) correctly signals approximately @xmath123 of the wildfires in the data set , compared to @xmath124 for model ( [ eqn : model2 ] ) .",

    "note that this method of evaluating predictive efficacy over a fine grid of spatial - temporal locations is rather cumbersome for models ( [ eq7])([eq8 ] ) , due to the need to individually estimate the fuel age associated with each wildfire , with respect to each spatial - temporal grid location and time , and each such evaluation requires a rather burdensome computation described in peng and schoenberg ( @xcite )",
    ".    days . ]    days . ]",
    "the fit of the models can be evaluated by examining their spatial - temporal residuals over a relatively coarse grid .",
    "for instance , figure [ fig6 ] shows the medians of the absolute values of the residuals in each month , for models ( [ eqn : model1])([eq8 ] ) , where each residual is computed over a space  time grid of @xmath126 sqkm @xmath127 @xmath128 days .",
    "it is evident that models ( [ eqn : model3 ] ) , ( [ eqn : model5 ] ) , ( [ eqn : model6 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) , and ( [ eq8 ] ) outperform the other three models , especially in the late summer and fall months when most wildfires in los angeles county occur .",
    "the months of october and november are especially critical , since santa ana winds prevail and can cause catastrophic wildfires .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows a spatial plot of the medians of the absolute values of the residuals , over all months . from figure [ fig7 ]",
    "one sees that the eight models perform surprisingly comparably in terms of the median absolute residual , though models ( [ eqn : model3])([eq8 ] ) , which use meteorological data directly , have better performance than model ( [ eqn : model2 ] ) in the sense that the corresponding residuals are generally closer to zero in most areas .",
    "these residual plots also indicate that several of the models may require improvement in the northwest portion of the angeles national forest , as well as near the border with san bernardino county on the eastern side of los angeles county . from the residuals in figure [ fig7 ]",
    ", one can observe that the residuals for models ( [ eqn : model5 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) , and ( [ eq8 ] ) are highly concentrated around zero except a few large values that occur in the northwest part and east part of los angeles county .",
    "the models explored here use the identical information recorded at the raws stations and used as inputs into the computation of the bi .",
    "hence , it seems relevant to compare the fit of such models with comparable spatial interpolations of bi measurements , and the fact that the models using the weather variables directly appear to offer superior fit suggests that the bi may not be effective as a short - term forecasting measure of wildfire hazard in los angeles county .",
    "it should be noted that the empirical relationship between a fire danger rating index such as the bi and wildfire incidence is only one way to evaluate the effectiveness of such an index ; alternatives may include assessing the cost - effectiveness of staffing or other decisions made based on the index .",
    "furthermore , the use of fire danger ratings by fire department officials for wildfire suppression and prevention activities may confound the empirical relationship between fire danger ratings and observed wildfire activity .",
    "nevertheless , most evaluation studies of fire danger rating systems relate such indices to ultimate fire responses , including fire incidence and fire size .",
    "indeed , andrews and bradshaw ( @xcite ) , whose work was instrumental in the current implementation of the bi , suggested that the value of a fire danger index be evaluated according to its relationship with fire activity , which may be defined as the incidence of large wildfires .",
    "such empirical relationships have been used as support for the use of such rating systems for predictive purposes [ haines et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; haines , main and simard ( @xcite ) ; mees and chase ( @xcite ) ; mandallaz and ye ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; viegas et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; andrews , loftsgaarden and bradshaw ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the results here suggest that , for the purpose of forecasting wildfire hazard , point process models using raws records and previous wildfire activity as covariates may represent a  promising alternative to existing indices that use essentially the same information .",
    "however , we must emphasize that the point process models proposed here remain rather simplistic and could potentially be improved by incorporating a host of other important variables , such as detailed vegetation type , vegetation cover , soil characteristics , other weather variables such as cloud cover and lightning , as well as human factors such as land use and public policy .",
    "the exclusion of such variables from this analysis is solely motivated by our aim to optimize forecasts given the same remote , automatically - recorded information used in the computation of the bi .",
    "the models considered here could also perhaps be improved in various ways .",
    "for instance , one might allow long - term temporal trends and/or allow the seasonal component to vary from year to year .",
    "in addition , one may consider estimating the kernel function in models ( [ eqn : model5 ] ) and ( [ eqn : model6 ] ) for each station using only local wildfires close to the corresponding station , or perhaps by some more sophisticated weighting scheme where nearby fires are given higher weight in the estimation of this function .",
    "because daily burn areas are right - skewed [ schoenberg , peng and woods ( @xcite ) ] , perhaps kernel regressions where the response variable is some transformation of the daily burn area might yield superior results .",
    "an additional important direction for future work is the exploration of similar point process models for wildfire occurrences in other locations and for other vegetation types or alternative wildfire regimes , as well as the use of such models for actual _ prospective _ predictions of wildfire activity , rather than merely the empirical assessment of goodness of fit to historical data .",
