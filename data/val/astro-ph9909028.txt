    "during a survey of carbon stars in the galactic halo  @xcite , spectroscopic observations of a stellar candidate revealed it to be a broad absorption line quasar at a redshift of @xmath1  @xcite . with @xmath2",
    "this system apparently possesses a luminosity exceeding @xmath3 , placing it amongst the most luminous objects currently known .",
    "the optical emission is coincident with a bright iras source and follow - up observations with submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope reveal that a substantial proportion of this emission arises in the sub - mm / ir regime  @xcite .",
    "this is characteristic of emission from warm dust and indicates that apm  08279 + 5255represents one of the most extreme examples of an ultraluminous infrared galaxy  @xcite .",
    "analysis of ground - based images , obtained with the 1.0 m jacobus kapteyn telescope on la palma , revealed that the point spread function of apm  08279 + 5255  was not stellar , but in fact was better represented by a pair of point - like sources separated by @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "such a configuration is indicative of the action of gravitational lensing .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed using adaptive optical imaging at the canada - france - hawaii telescope  @xcite , as well as images from the 10 m keck telescope  @xcite and nicmos images from the hubble space telescope  @xcite , that clearly reveal the composite nature of this system .",
    "several gravitational lens models have been derived from these studies , suggesting that the magnification of the quasar source is @xmath5 . even accounting for this substantial magnification , apm  08279",
    "+ 5255   remains amongst the most intrinsically luminous systems currently known .",
    "its apparent brightness , however , has made it an ideal target for several studies of high redshift quasars  ( downes et al .",
    "1999 ; hines , schmidt & smith  1999 ; ellison et al .",
    "1999 ; ellison et al .",
    "1999a )    in this paper , we too take advantage of the gravitational lensing magnification and present the results of one year of photometric monitoring of this phenomenal object . in section  [ observations ]",
    "we outline the observational programme , data reduction technique and results of the monitoring , while in section  [ variability ] we discuss the source of the observed variability .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] presents the conclusions of this study and discusses their relevance .",
    "the 0.5-m telescope , cousins r filter and ` star i ' ccd camera of the climenhaga observatory of the university of victoria ( robb & honkanen , 1992 ) were used for the photometric observations .",
    "apm  08279 + 5255 s apparent brightness makes it an ideal extragalactic target for such a telescope . at a redshift of 3.911",
    ", the r - band filter encompasses @xmath6 and  @xmath7 , as well as weak emission of si+o  @xmath8 , with  @xmath9 occurring in the red tail of the filter [ see figure  1 of irwin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ] .",
    "the prominent emission lines are strongly absorbed from both self - absorption and strong broad absorption line features , and the dominant flux in the band is continuum emission from the quasar .    using standard iraf routines , the frames were bias subtracted , flat - fielded , and the magnitudes were derived from @xmath10 apertures using the `` centroid '' centering option of the phot package [ see  @xcite for more details of the reduction procedure ] . due to the small field of view , extinction effects are negligible and no corrections have been made for them .",
    "also , no corrections were applied to transform the r - band magnitudes to a standard system .",
    "the field around apm  08279 + 5255  is shown in figure 1 .",
    "in addition to the quasar , several prominent stars are apparent .",
    "differential magnitudes were calculated by comparison with a bright ` standard ' star labelled * s2*. the automatic observing procedure exposed a number of images of the field , between 2 and 100 , over a night , dependent upon weather conditions .",
    "typically @xmath11 frames , each with an integration time of 222 sec , were thereby obtained .",
    "the photometric data in each of the 23 nights for which data was procured was examined for brightness variations that might have occurred during the night , but no significant variations could be attributed to any of the targets .",
    "the fields acquired in a single night of observing were , therefore , combined .",
    "differential magnitudes with respect to * s2 * were calculated for apm  08279 + 5255  and the other stars labelled in the figure  1 .",
    "these results are tabulated in table  1 and are presented graphically in figure  2 . to improve clarity ,",
    "the light curves in this figure have been offset from their original values .",
    "an examination of the light curves for the brighter stars in the field , specifically * s1 * , * s2 * and * s4 * , reveals that they have remained constant over the observing period .",
    "this also appears to be the case for * s3 * , although it does possess several systematic variations that suggest variability .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of these nightly means was found to be @xmath12 for * s1 * -*s2*. this standard deviation assures us that both the stars * s1 * and * s2 * are not variable at this level of precision . comparing apm  08279 + 5255  to * s2",
    "* , however , the overall differential magnitude was found to be @xmath13 , suggesting that significant variability took place during the course of our monitoring campaign .",
    "this is very apparent on examination of the light curves with the most dramatic systematic change in any light curve occurring in apm08-*s2*. while initially remaining constant at the start of the observing period , at day  1230 it begins to brighten , with an increase of @xmath14 mag by the final observation .",
    "what is the source of the observed variability in apm  08279 + 5255 ?",
    "two possibilities immediately present themselves , each with different consequences for our understanding of this gravitationally lensed , ultraluminous system .",
    "while some quasars show spectacular multi - wavelength variability on short timescales [ e.g. optically - violent variables  @xcite and intra - day variables  @xcite ] , all quasars are seen to vary by some degree and several groups have employed a variability selection criterion to successfully identify samples of quasars  @xcite . thought to arise in variable accretion rates and disk instabilities in the central regions of the quasar nucleus , several studies of the characteristics of quasar variability have been undertaken in recent years  @xcite with the goal of unraveling the structure at the core of quasars [ c.f .",
    "@xcite considered a sample of three hundred quasars over an extended baseline of several years and found that , while the amplitude of quasar variability appears not to be a function of redshift , there is an inverse trend of the amplitude of the variability with the absolute magnitude of the quasar .",
    "considering the scatter in their relation , however , the observed variability in apm  08279 + 5255  is quite consistent with it being intrinsic to the quasar .      given the small image separation , the light from apm  08279 + 5255  must pass through the inner regions of the lensing galaxy where the optical depth to microlensing can be substantial . unlike the simple single or binary star microlensing seen in the galactic halo  @xcite , microlensing in this regime results in complex light curves which are characterized by regions of high magnification variability , interspaced with quiescent periods of demagnification  @xcite .",
    "could the observed variability be due to such microlensing ?",
    "the quintessential example of a microlensed quasar is the quadruply imaged q2237 + 0305 which , with over a decade of monitoring , has reveal microlensing variations of up to 0.3 mag in a matter of weeks  @xcite . comparing the light curves of the two systems and noting that , given the relative gravitational lensing geometry , the time scale of microlensing events should be @xmath15 longer than those seen in q2237 + 0305 ( a value which is reasonably insensitive to the assumed cosmology ) , the observed rise is also consistent with the microlensing hypothesis .",
    "this paper has presented the results of a year of monitoring the gravitationally lensed , ultraluminous broad absorption line quasar apm  08279 + 5255 .",
    "photometry relative to several stars in the field reveals that , in the latter months of these observations , apm  08279 + 5255  has brightened by @xmath14 magnitudes .",
    "there are two potential causes for the source of this variability ; either this high redshift quasar source is being microlensed by stars in a foreground galaxy , or the variability is intrinsic to the quasar source .",
    "both hypotheses are consistent with the current data and further photometric monitoring is required before the exact source of the variability can be determined .",
    "evidence for gravitational microlensing in apm  08279 + 5255  raises an interesting possibility . as discussed earlier , even accounting for the effects of macrolensing the luminosity of apm  08279",
    "+ 5255  is substantial and intrinsically it still ranks amongst the most luminous objects known . but could apm  08279 + 5255  be a ` normal ' quasar that is undergoing an extreme gravitational microlensing magnification event ? two arguments suggest this is not the case :    * * differential lensing : * the degree to which a source is magnified is dependent upon its scale size , with small sources being more strongly magnified  @xcite . during the microlensing of quasars",
    "this results in the enhancement of only the continuum emission from the central accretion disk , with the emission from the more extended broad line region remaining unchanged [ c.f .",
    "similarly , in apm  08279 + 5255 , while the quasar continuum flux could be enhanced by microlensing , the sub - mm / ir flux which arises in an extended dusty region will remain unchanged .",
    "subject to only macrolensing effects , the inferred sub - mm / ir luminosity of apm  08279 + 5255  is a prodigious @xmath16 ( ibata et al .",
    "1999 ; egami et al . 1999 ) and it remains intrinsically an extremely luminous object . * * statistical considerations : * microlensing is a stochastic process whose probability of magnification , @xmath17 , falls rapidly at high values ( @xmath18 ) . examining the high resolution images  @xcite , the two main images ( a&b ) are of very similar brightness , within 25% of each other . if we were ( un)lucky enough to have caught apm  08279 + 5255   during a high magnification event , high enough to account for its apparent hyperluminous properties ,",
    "is it possible that more than one image would be in such a state ?",
    "if we assume that to be in this apparently ultraluminous state an image suffers a microlensing amplification of greater than @xmath19 , then the probability of finding the second image also magnified by this factor is less than @xmath20 . hence it is very unlikely that both images are simultaneously undergoing substantial microlensing enhancement .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that while microlensing may account for the observed variability , it can not play a dominant role in distorting our view .",
    "intrinsically apm  08279 + 5255  must be an extremely luminous system .",
    "the identification of variability in apm  08279 + 5255  can further help reveal the true nature of this complex system .",
    "high resolution images with both nicmos on the hubble space telescope  @xcite and with the 10 m keck telescope  @xcite clearly show that the two bright images identified in earlier observations are accompanied by a fainter image ( designated c ) located between them . while several arguments suggest that this is a third image of the high redshift quasar source , its location is suspiciously close to where one would expect to find the foreground lensing galaxy  @xcite .",
    "if the high redshift source is indeed variable , a high spatial resolution monitoring program would clearly reveal whether c also varies in step with the other images ( subject to a gravitational lens time delay ) , revealing it to truly be a third image , or the lensing galaxy .",
    "this procedure would also determine the degree of microlensing in each of the individual images .",
    "while current observations are unable to fully constrain the gravitational lensing geometry in apm  08279 + 5255 , the simple image configuration suggests that the dominant mass along the line of sight is a single , isolated galaxy ( ibata et al . 1999 ; egami et al . 1999 ) .",
    "further observations , such as deep imaging of the field around apm  08279 + 5255 , will refine this picture as it will allow an accurate model for the lensing potential to be determined . a variable source and",
    "a simple gravitational lensing geometry suggests that apm  08279 + 5255   may represent one of the few ` golden ' gravitational lenses from which cosmological parameters can be derived from time delay measurements between the various images  @xcite .",
    "apm  08279 + 5255  is clearly an ideal subject for a high resolution monitoring campaign .",
