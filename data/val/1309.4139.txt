    "during the past one - and - a - half decades , the transient fluctuation theorems , known as jarzynski equality @xcite and crooks relation @xcite have attracted wide interest .",
    "they constitute exact relations for the non - linear response of systems in thermal equilibrium to arbitrary perturbations . as such",
    "they apply to a wide variety of systems , including for example bio - molecules , colloids , nuclear spins , cold atoms , and clusters of atoms , to name just a few .",
    "these theorems have motivated numerous studies on the dynamics of small systems and also have revived and fertilized the field of nonequilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "reviews of the different theoretical aspects of transient fluctuation theorems applying to classical and quantum dynamics of open and closed systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "apart from theoretical studies , the fluctuation theorems have also inspired experimental studies @xcite and have become the basis of a method for determining free energy differences of different configurations of large molecules @xcite .",
    "the central object of the transient fluctuation theorems is the _ work _",
    "performed on a system by the variation of external parameters .",
    "work together with heat constitute basic notions on which any thermodynamic description rests .",
    "therefore , a convenient operational definition for work that is also applicable to quantum systems is of eminent importance in the thermodynamic description of biological and artificial devices on the nanoscale , the design of quantum engines , and quantum information processing .    in the present work , we will restrict ourselves to the discussion of closed quantum systems .",
    "the validity of the fluctuation theorems is then based on the reversibility of hamiltonian dynamics and on the assumption that the system is initially prepared in canonical equilibrium described by a gibbs state ; out of this state , external time - dependent forces @xmath0 entering the system hamiltonian @xmath1 drive the system away from equilibrium according to a prescribed protocol @xmath2 of finite duration @xmath3 .",
    "the work performed on a system in such a process is a statistical quantity , which can be characterized by a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath4 .",
    "an associated backward process starts in thermal equilibrium at the initial inverse temperature @xmath5 and at the time - reversed final parameter values .",
    "the parameter values are then retraced according to the backward protocol @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the parity of the parameter @xmath8 under time - reversal , for example @xmath9 for an electrical and @xmath10 for a magnetic field .",
    "the crooks relation then connects the pdfs of the forward protocol @xmath11 and of the backward protocol @xmath12 in the following way : @xmath13 provided that the hamiltonian satisfies the instantaneous time reversal symmetry @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the time - reversal operator . in the crooks relation",
    ", @xmath16 denotes the difference in free energies of canonical equilibrium systems at the force values at the end and at the beginning of the protocol .",
    "the free energy @xmath17 is defined in terms of the respective canonical partition function @xmath18 the jarzynski equality @xmath19 follows as a direct consequence of the crooks relation .    for later use",
    ", we note that the crooks relation can be expressed in terms of the characteristic function of work , defined as the fourier transform of the work pdf , @xmath20 in the equivalent way , reading @xmath21    other than in the classical case , direct experimental confirmations of the quantum transient fluctuation theorems are still missing .",
    "et al_.  @xcite suggested an experimental proof by means of a cold atom sitting in a parabolic trap whose position can be varied .",
    "the difficulty of this , but also of other experiments testing transient quantum fluctuation theorems , lies in the measurement of the work performed on the system in a single realization .",
    "this requires two measurements of the system energy in the beginning and at the end of the protocol . in the theoretical investigations of the transient quantum fluctuation theorems @xcite , these measurements are projective @xcite",
    "that means that an energy eigenvalue @xmath22 with a corresponding eigenfunction @xmath23 will be measured in a state described by a density matrix @xmath24 with the probability @xmath25 and will leave the system immediately after the measurement in the state @xmath26 .",
    "one might suspect that a weaker , less invasive form of the energy measurements is simpler to realize in an experiment and still might leave the transient fluctuation theorems intact .",
    "this belief could be supported by the argument that any weaker , or less invasive measurement can be obtained as a projective measurement on a so - called ancilla which is typically an auxiliary two - level system that has to be brought into an entangled state with the actual system @xcite . under proper conditions ,",
    "the measurement on the ancilla gives the required information on the system , possibly with somewhat reduced accuracy , while the back - action of the ancilla on the system is weaker than a direct measurement would impose .    in two recent papers @xcite ,",
    "an experimental approach was suggested by means of which the characteristic function of work is encoded in the reduced density matrix of an ancilla .",
    "its realization requires a time - dependent system - ancilla coupling which follows the original force protocol amended by constant force periods of variable lengths . a tomography of the final ancilla state yields the characteristic function of work .",
    "in this way , projective energy measurements are avoided , yet , unlike the original setting , the forcing of the system is mediated by the coupling to the ancilla .",
    "the confirmation of the crooks relation and the jarzynski equality by means of this method was reported in @xcite .",
    "another experiment utilizing circuit cavity qed was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it though remains an open question whether generalized measurements can replace the projective energy measurements and still conform with the fluctuation relations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we shortly review the theory of generalized measurements ; for more extensive expositions we refer to the literature @xcite . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we derive the work distribution in the presence of generalized measurements and analyze in section  [ s4 ] the restrictions on these measurements under which the crooks relation and the jarzynski equality hold .",
    "we illustrate our results by the example of a two level system whose hamiltonian is suddenly changed , and end with some conclusions in section  [ s5 ] . for the sake of the reader s",
    "convenience , some technical arguments are presented in appendices [ a1 ] , [ a2 ] , and [ a3 ] .",
    "a generalized measurement is formally characterized by a set of measurement operators @xmath27 satisfying the normalization condition @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the identity operator on the hilbert space of the considered system . in the present study ,",
    "energy measurements are of central importance . for that purpose ,",
    "we need measurement operators @xmath27 that can identify the eigenstates @xmath23 of a hamiltonian @xmath30 with spectral representation @xmath31 where , for the sake of notional simplicity , we restrict ourselves to non - degenerate energy - eigenvalues .",
    "the identification of an energy eigenstate by means of the measurement operator @xmath27 in general will not be perfect , rather the expression @xmath32 quantifies the likelihood of an erroneous assignment @xmath33 if a measurement is applied on the energy - eigenstate @xmath23 . for general energy measurements @xmath27 ,",
    "the post - measurement state is given by the density matrix @xmath34 where @xmath24 denotes the density matrix immediately before the measurement and the expectation value of the `` effect '' @xmath35 , @xmath36 gives the probability with which the eigenstate @xmath23 is observed . if a measurement is performed but its result is not registered , the post - measurement state is given by @xmath37 .",
    "we want to emphasize that an energy measurement operator @xmath27 is primarily indicative of an energy eigenstate @xmath23 ; the assignment of the energy eigenvalue occurs by the quantum number @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the energy measurement operator @xmath27 need not depend on the actual energy eigenvalue @xmath22 .",
    "below we will make use of this possibility .    in the particular case when the conditional probability is sharp , @xmath39",
    ", we call the measurement @xmath27 _ error - free_. any error - free measurement operator @xmath27 is characterized by a single , normalized post - measurement state @xmath40 in terms of which it can be written as @xmath41 see appendix [ a1 ] for details . in general , for different @xmath38 , the post - measurement states need not be mutually orthogonal or linearly independent .    a special case of an error - free measurement is a projective measurement , for which @xmath42 and hence , @xmath43 .",
    "projective measurements are the only measurements that are error - free and that reproduce the result of the first measurement in an immediate repetition of the same measurement .",
    "error - free measurements which are not necessarily repeatable were introduced by landau and lifshitz in the first russian edition of their quantum mechanics in 1948 ; for an english translation see @xcite . according to the classification by wiseman and milburn @xcite",
    ", error - free measurements are called sharp measurements .",
    "as already mentioned , to obtain the work which is performed on a system during a protocol @xmath11 , two energy measurements are required , one at the beginning , and the second one at the end of the protocol . since , in general , the respective hamiltonian operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 at the beginning and at the end will be different , their instantaneous sets of eigenfunctions @xmath46 and @xmath47 and eigenvalues @xmath48 and @xmath49 will in general also differ . therefore , different sets of measurement operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 will be needed to determine the work . the probability to register an energy eigenstate @xmath52 of the hamiltonian @xmath44",
    "is given by ( [ pn ] ) with @xmath53 describing the thermal equilibrium at the beginning of the protocol . the conditional probability to measure the",
    "eigenstate @xmath54 of @xmath45 upon the observation of the eigenstate @xmath52 then becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the unitary time evolution for the period of the protocol , given by the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath57 with the resulting joint probability @xmath58 to measure first @xmath38 and then @xmath33 , the pdf of work takes the form : @xmath59 the characteristic function then takes the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath3 . requiring that the crooks relation ( [ gg ] ) also holds in the presence of generalized measurements , we find as a condition on the measurement operators the equation @xmath63 to obtain the right hand side , we expressed the time evolution of the reversed protocol , @xmath64 in terms of that of the forward process by means of time reversal symmetry , i.e. , by @xmath65 , @xcite .",
    "the condition ( [ cc ] ) is necessary and sufficient for the crooks relation to be satisfied .",
    "it presents a central formal result of our paper .",
    "we ask now whether energy measurement operators exist that do not depend on details of the protocol but for which the crooks relation is satisfied .",
    "more precisely , we want to identify _ universal _ measurements operators @xmath66 , @xmath62 and @xmath3 , that satisfy the crooks relation for all possible protocols having the same pairs of initial and final energy eigenstates @xmath67 , independent of the particular values of the eigenenergies at the beginning and the end . as a consequence ,",
    "universal measurements operators must be independent of the temperature of the initial state and of the particular protocol .",
    "obviously , projective measurements are universal , but are there also others ?",
    "the answer to this question can be found by analyzing ( [ cc ] ) . as just mentioned , for universal measurement operators , ( [ cc ] ) must be satisfied for any protocol that connects the initial and the final hamiltonian within a finite time @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it must also hold for the following particular protocol consisting of two sudden switches : one at the beginning and the second one at the end of the protocol .",
    "the first switch suddenly changes the hamiltonian from its initial form @xmath44 to @xmath68 . here , @xmath69 is a positive time scale and , as a hamiltonian , @xmath70 must be hermitean , but otherwise it is arbitrary .",
    "the second switch results in the final hamiltonian @xmath45 . for this protocol , the time - evolution from @xmath71 to @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 because the initial and final moments of the protocol at which the hamiltonian differs from @xmath70 do not contribute to @xmath74 .",
    "with @xmath70 being an arbitrary hamiltonian and @xmath69 an arbitrary time , the condition ( [ cc ] ) must be satisfied for any unitary operator @xmath74 in the case of universal measurements . as the simplest choice",
    ", one may take @xmath75 leading with @xmath76 to @xmath77 using the explicit expressions ( [ q ] ) and ( [ r ] ) , we find @xmath78 where @xmath79\\:,\\label{cab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath80 because the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 are independent of @xmath83 , @xmath5 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for universal measurements , the terms @xmath86 must vanish individually , further implying that @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "taking the sum of @xmath81 over all @xmath33 and , accordingly , the sum of @xmath82 over all @xmath38 one obtains for the conditional probabilities @xmath91 hence , both the first ( @xmath92 ) and the second ( @xmath93 ) energy measurements must be error - free . using the expression ( [ mef ] ) for error - free measurements ,",
    "we find as a necessary condition that the measurement operators assume the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the @xmath38th instantaneous eigenstate of @xmath96 and @xmath97 the respective , normalized post - measurement state .",

    "this requirement leads after some algebra , for details see appendix  [ a2 ] , to the conclusion that the post - measurement states @xmath100 have to coincide with the eigenstates @xmath101 , for @xmath102 and @xmath3 , possibly up to irrelevant phase factors . in other words ,",
    "our main conclusion is that projective measurements are the only universal measurements that lead to the crooks relation .",
    "however , one may design the post - measurement states such that they satisfy the relation ( [ db ] ) for a given protocol . for this particular , non - projective error - free measurement , the crooks relation and consequently",
    "also the jarzynski equality are satisfied .",
    "it is interesting to note that ( [ db ] ) is analogous to the generalized detailed balance condition for transitions in forward and backward force protocols when the respective initial states are microcanonical @xcite . in the present case of generalized measurements",
    ", this generalized detailed balance condition requires that the respective transition probabilities from the post - measurement states of the first to the target states of the second measurement are the same for the forward and the backward protocol , i.e. , @xmath103 this follows from the fact that the right hand side of ( [ db ] ) can equally be expressed in terms of the time - reversed dynamics @xmath64 as @xmath104 .      requiring only the validity of the jarzynski equality for universal generalized measurements ,",
    "one finds that the initial energy measurement must be error - free , @xmath105 with post - measurement states @xmath106 that form a complete orthonormal basis set , hence satisfying @xmath107 moreover , the second energy measurement must be determined by effects @xmath108 that have unit trace , @xmath109 . for a proof of these necessary and sufficient conditions",
    "see appendix [ a3 ] .",
    "we illustrate our results by the example of a two level system which undergoes a sudden switch from @xmath110 to @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 denote pauli spin matrices .",

    "the jarzynski equality holds for universal energy measurements if the first one is error - free with a complete set of orthonormal post - measurement states , and the second one has effects with unit trace .",
    "the crooks relation remains valid for other than projective measurements only if both the initial and final energy measurements are error free with post - measurement states that are adapted to the actual protocol in such a way that the transition probabilities satisfy the generalized detailed balance relation ( [ db ] ) .",
