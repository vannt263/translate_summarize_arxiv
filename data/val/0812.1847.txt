    "the most plausible mechanism of the acceleration is the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , which explains broadband power - law spectrum with an index around 2 @xcite . before the dsa phase in which electrons cross the shock front many times",
    ", they have to be pre - accelerated by unknown injection mechanism .",
    "such `` injection problem '' is still unresolved .",
    "one of the possible injection mechanisms for electrons is the electron surfing acceleration by electrostatic fields @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a one - dimensional ( 1d ) electromagnetic full particle simulation and found the formation of large - amplitude electrostatic solitary structures during the cyclic reformation of a high - mach - number perpendicular shock in a low - beta and weakly magnetized plasma .",
    "the coherent solitary structures trap electrons in their electrostatic potential well , resulting in significant surfing acceleration of electrons .",
    "so far , the electron surfing acceleration has been argued for high - mach - number shocks , and studied by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a typical astrophysical example of such high - mach - number shocks is the young supernova remnant ( snr ) , which is thought to be an accelerator of high - energy electrons , emitting bright synchrotron radiation in radio and x - ray bands at shocks with mach number of @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in many astrophysical environments , the electron acceleration at lower - mach - number ( @xmath2 ) shocks is inferred from observations and/or expected theoretically .",
    "possible examples are old snrs or old snrs interacting with giant molecular clouds @xcite , merging galaxy clusters @xcite , agn outbursts at the galaxy clusters @xcite , and so on .",
    "the electron acceleration is also observed at earth s bow shock even with a low mach number of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "hence it is interesting to ask whether the electron surfing acceleration can occur at lower - mach - number shocks or not .",
    "it has been demonstrated by one - dimensional full particle simulations that the electron surfing acceleration takes place at a relatively - high - mach - number shock of @xmath4 but not at a very - low - mach - number shock of @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .25 , is usually adopted for computational efficiency . in general , different mass ratio sometimes changes the simulation results qualitatively , and the simulation results with a reduced mass ratio can not be directly compared with astrophysical phenomena or results of hybrid simulations . therefore , to avoid a confusion",
    ", we use a notation @xmath6 for the mach number of shocks with a reduced mass ratio , while we use another notation @xmath7 for the real mass ratio .",
    "] however , these previous works on the electron surfing acceleration are mainly based on 1d simulations , in which configuration of shock magnetic fields can not be modified .",
    "it is well known from resuts of two - dimensional hybrid - code simulations that there exist large - amplitude fluctuations in the magnetic field and density of the shock transition region of lower - mach - number shocks ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations at the shock surface have been analyzed in terms of turbulent `` ripples '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite has demonstrated , using a combination of self - consistent hybrid simulation and test particle calculation , that energetic electrons are produced by both magnetic mirroring by the rippled structure and by stochastic acceleration by magnetic fluctuations keeps particles within the shock transition region .",
    "however , electron - scale microscopic instabilities , i.e. , current driven instabilities are neglected in the combination of hybrid simulation and test - particle calculation . hence multi - dimensional full particle simulations are necessary for studying the effect of ion - scale rippling of a perpendicular shock on the electron surfing acceleration .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the dynamic rippled structuring of the shock front on electron acceleration processes by the first - principle full particle simulation . in order to take into account the rippling of a perpendicular shock , simulation domain is taken to be larger than the ion inertial length .",

    "finally , section 4 gives summary of this paper .",
    "in this paper , a collisionless shock is excited with the `` relaxation method '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the simulation domain is taken in the rest frame of the excited shock . generally speaking ,",
    "it is not easy to perform a large - scale ( ion - scale ) multi - dimensional full particle simulations of collisionless shocks even with present - day supercomputers .",
    "this is because a shock wave excited by conventional method becomes unsteady relative to the simulation domain .",
    "very recently , however , a two - dimensional shock - rest - frame model has been successfully developed by @xcite , which is important to be able to follow the shock for a long time with a limited computer resource .",
    "we use a 2d electromagnetic particle code @xcite , in which the full set of maxwell s equations and the relativistic equation of motion for individual electrons and ions are solved in a self - consistent mannar . the continuity equation for charge",

    "we need a strong ion current in the @xmath82 direction to enhance the current - driven instability .",

    "are found at @xmath78 1.5 , where electrostatic waves are strongly enhanced .",
    "the existence of nonthermal components in @xmath84 is the evidence of the electron surfing acceleration at low - mach - number perpendicular shock with @xmath0 .",
    "the electron surfing acceleration takes place in a localized region where a negative shock - normal current due to reflected ions is strongly enhanced .",
    "figure 4 shows energy distribution functions of electrons in the downstream region for runs a and b. the solid line shows the result of run a , and the dashed line shows the result of run b. firstly , we found nonthermal electrons in run a while there is no nonthermal electrons in run b. secondly , the downstream temperature in runs a and b is very different , indicating the existence of additional electron energization mechanism in run a , i.e. , rippling of the perpendicular shock discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have also performed a 1d simulation run and confirmed that the electron energy spectrum is essentially the same as that in run b.    the electron energy distribution for run b ( dashed line ) corresponds to the maxwellian distribution function with thermal velocity of @xmath85 , which can be explained by the plasma heating by magnetic compression . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal component of electron energy distribution for run a ( dotted line ) corresponds to the maxwellian distribution function with thermal velocity of @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , the maximum energy of electrons reaches @xmath87 in run a.    the rippled structure can further energize electrons as discussed by @xcite , which can explain the maxwellian distribution for run a. in the shock foot region ( @xmath88 ) , the magnitude of the magnetic field is @xmath89 .",
    "the average amplitude of electrostatic waves excited by the current - driven instability is @xmath90 .",
    "thus the maximum energy of non - thermal electrons becomes about @xmath91 via the electron surfing acceleration as indicated from the @xmath80 and @xmath83 phase - space plots shown in figure 3e .",
    "thus there is three effects for energization of non - thermal electrons : the first is the electron surfing acceleration ; the second is the magnetic compression at the shock overshoot ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the third is the scattering by ion - scale rippled structure @xcite . to reach the maximum energy of @xmath87 all the three effects",
    "are needed .",
    "both in run b and in the 1d run , the current - driven instability due to reflected ions excites electrostatic waves with amplitude of @xmath92 .",
    "however , this amplitude is not enough for the electron surfing acceleration .",
    "by contrast , the amplitude of the locally - excited electrostatic wave exceeds @xmath93 in run a as shown in figure 3a , and energetic electrons are generated by the electron surfing acceleration .",
    "this result suggests that microscopic current - driven instability enhanced by the ion - scale rippled structure of the low - mach - number perpendicular shock generates nonthermal electrons , as observed in moderate - mach - number perpendicular shocks of @xmath94 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we have studied electron acceleration at a low - mach - number perpendicular collisionless shock by performing two - dimensional full particle simulations . in order to take into account the effect of the rippling of a perpendicular shock @xcite",
    ", the simulation domain is taken to be larger than the ion inertial scale by using the shock - rest - frame model @xcite . in the previous works ,",
    "the electron acceleration by electron - scale microscopic instabilities at low - mach - number perpendicular shocks has not focused on because the electron surfing acceleration by electrostatic waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is one of the possible injection mechanisms for electrons , is thought to be effective only in high - mach - number perpendicular shocks .",
    "the present result suggests , by contrast , that the electron surfing acceleration is also a common feature at a perpendicular shock with @xmath95 .",
    "the mechanism for generation of high - energy electrons is quite simple , and is summarized as follows : the perpendicular shock forms the rippled structures by ion temperature anisotropy ; the rippled structures excite a strong electric field component in the shock - normal direction ; reflected ions in the shock transition region is strongly accelerated upstream by the electric field component of rippled structures ; the strongly - accelerated reflected ions give a high growth rate of a current - driven instability to large - amplitude electrostatic waves in a localized region ; energetic electrons are generated by the electrostatic waves via surfing acceleration .",
    "finally , high - energy non - thermal electrons are generated by both magnetic compression and scattering by ion - scale rippled structure in the shock transition region .",
    "it has been demonstrated that multi - dimensionality sometimes weakens the electron surfing acceleration in the 2d simulations of uniform plasma models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and self - consistent shock models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very recently , however , @xcite have found the electron surfing acceleration in 2d simulation of a perpendicular shock with out - of - plane magnetic field . in their 2d simulation ,",
    "the simulation domain is taken to be much larger than the ion inertial length along the shock surface , and kinetic effects of ions are fully included .",
    "the present result is another example showing the effect of ion kinetics to the electron surfing acceleration .",
    "it has been confirmed that the cross - scale coupling between an ion - scale mesoscopic instability and an electron - scale microscopic instability is important .",
    "hence , a large - scale full particle simulation would be essential for studies of the electron acceleration at collisionless shocks .",
    "finally let us discuss on the reduced mass ratio",
    ". in the present simulation with @xmath0 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , the buneman - type mode becomes unstable at @xmath98 when we use a reduced mass ratio of @xmath99 .",
    "when we use the real mass ratio of @xmath100 , the thermal velocity of upstream electrons becomes about 8.6 times as large as the case of @xmath99 , the self - reformation process is suppressed and the buneman - type mode is also stabilized @xcite . to make the buneman - type mode unstable",
    "the electron thermal velocity must be smaller than the relative velocity between incoming electrons and reflected ions .",
