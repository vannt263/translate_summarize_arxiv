    "the broadening of this step function into the sigmoidal shape observed in experiments has been attributed to inhomogeneities in nanowire width or thickness , or to variations in the position of the photon absorption site affecting vortex entry at the edge of the wire competing with unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs away from the edge@xcite .",

    "we found that a sigmoidal shape is expected even in the absence of these inhomogeneities .",

    "there is a count event every time the energy @xmath52 exceeds the threshold @xmath56 , determined from @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the temperature at which the hotspot undergoes transition from the superconducting to the normal state .",
    "this temperature depends on bias current and external magnetic field and can be found for a narrow wire using the solution of the usadel equation for density of states@xcite and the dependence of the order parameter on current , temperature and magnetic field@xcite .    in wider wires",
    "the characteristic shape of a hotspot is more complicated .",
    "if the photon absorption site is not close to the edge of the wire , then the hotspot is cylindrical .",
    "its radius , @xmath59 , is smaller than its width , @xmath60 , the hotspot does not span the wire width , and its creation results in a current density redistribution .",
    "the latter depends on the lateral coordinate of the absorption site , @xmath61 ( 2-dimensional geometry ) .",
    "finally , in very thick wires the hotspot may be spherical ( or close to semi - spherical for shallow absorption ) , with the radius @xmath62 .",

    "the change in the current flow facilitates vortex entry at the edges of the nanowire or unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs .",

    "the variance is determined from two statistically independent processes as @xmath81 .",
    "following photon absorption , a rapid process of energy down - conversion is initiated , engaging numerous electronic and phonon excitations .",
    "phonons can be divided into two groups .",
    "non - pair - breaking phonons with energy @xmath82 smaller than twice the order parameter @xmath83 are decoupled from the condensate and can only be reabsorbed by excited qps . in thin films we neglect their reabsorption , assuming the re - absorption time to be considerably longer than their escape into a substrate or thermalization time .",
    "in contrast , higher energy phonons can break cooper pairs and exchange energy with the electronic system . in a bulk superconductor ,",
    "if the distance from the absorption site to escape interface far exceeds the phonon mean free path , none of the pair - braking phonons escapes into the thermal bath before qps thermalise . by the end of down - conversion the energy of a photon splits between qps and non - pair - breaking phonons .",
    "@xmath84 describes statistical fluctuations of @xmath52 originating from fluctuations of numbers of pair - breaking phonons under the assumption that none of the pair - breaking phonons from the down - conversion cascade escapes .",
    "it can be written @xmath85 , where 2@xmath86 is the mean energy which is necessary to spend in order to generate one pair of qps . in superconducting films with thickness comparable to the",
    "mean free path of pair - breaking phonons , some of the highly energetic ( athermal ) phonons will escape .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath52 we must write @xmath87 , where we introduce @xmath88 to account for the average fraction of athermal phonons escaping from the nanowire prior to random partition of energy between qps and non - pair - breaking phonons , which are de - coupled from condensate . the fano factor in most superconductors is @xmath89@xcite .",
    "the energy loss from the film due to escaping athermal phonons is a random process , depending on mean free paths of phonons and transmission characteristics into the substrate .",
    "therefore , there appears the second independent contribution to the variance , @xmath90 .",
    "if all athermal phonons are re - absorbed in the film , which is the case for thick films illuminated from the top , then @xmath91 and @xmath92 while @xmath93 becomes the known fano fluctuations variance .",
    "@xmath90 originates from fluctuations in the transmission of athermal phonons to the substrate@xcite : @xmath94 , we call this contribution phonon down - conversion noise .",
    "this contribution to fano noise has also been expressed in conventional form@xcite with the factor @xmath95 .",
    "the accurate determination of fano - factor @xmath95 is not an easy problem .",
    "it involves evaluation of statistical fluctuations of loss of successive generations of athermal phonons , which are part of evolving distribution of the down - conversion process .",
    "we may , however , derive the lower limit to @xmath95 .",
    "while lower - energy longer - living phonons from later generations account for the majority of energy loss , the opposite is true for fluctuations of energy loss .",
    "with multiplication of phonon numbers and decrease of their mean energy , the relative fluctuation of energy loss from phonons from later - generations decreases .",
    "we estimate the contribution to @xmath95 from phonons of first generation ( phonon bubble ) designating it @xmath96 and ignore contributions from subsequent athermal phonon generations arriving in the lower limit , @xmath97 .    in a thin film ,",
    "photons are absorbed homogeneously through the depth of the film , and , similarly , phonons of the first generation ( phonon bubble ) are also homogeneously generated while the energetic photoelectron(hole ) performs a random walk in the film .",
    "thus , taking the limit @xmath98 and @xmath99 we simplify the expression for @xmath96 , which was derived in earlier work@xcite and obtain @xmath100\\right\\}}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath101 is the angle of total internal reflection , so that phonons that impinge the escape interface at larger angles stay inside the plane parallel film until they undergo scattering - assisted conversion and move at smaller angles @xmath102 , @xmath103 is the phonon transmission coefficient through the interface with the substrate for incidence below the critical angle , and @xmath104 is the mean free path of debye phonons with respect to absorption by electrons .",
    "this result has the following meaning .",
    "the variance of the number of phonons emitted into the critical cone from any energy interval follows a binomial distribution .",
    "the contributions from phonons of different energies are statistically independent . therefore , total variance is the sum ( integral ) of contributions from individual groups of phonons of the flat distribution of phonons of the first generation .",
    "individual factors in the expression ( [ fano j ] ) reflect : @xmath9 - the dominant phonon energy in the phonon bubble , @xmath105 - probability of survival until reaching the escape interface , the inner integral - averaging phonon contributions over their distribution , accounting for their probabilities to reach the interface depending on energy and angle of incidence within the critical cone .",
    "note that a binomial distribution is close to a normal distribution in expression ( [ s lineshape ] ) under the assumption of large phonon numbers in each energy interval .",
    "thus , integration over the spectrum works well for phonons of later generations . for first - generation phonons it works for the dominant phonon group with energies close to debye energy , and",
    "the second integral in ( [ fano j ] ) is an approximation of the dominant phonon contribution .",
    "the total variance due to fano noise can be written as @xmath106 , where the effective fano - factor is @xmath107 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath108 relies on using the simplest model of one phonon - mode with a linear dispersion relation ( debye ) approximation . for phonons of the first few generations we have @xmath12 , and",
    "our estimate of @xmath109 is not affected by disorder . given these approximations this estimate provides only a rough indication of the magnitude of the effect .    in the next section",
    "we compare our simulation with experiments on wsi snspds . because of the large acoustic mismatch between wsi ( w@xmath110si ) and the sio@xmath111 substrate , even for normal incidence we have @xmath112 .",
    "taking @xmath113 for wsi on amoprphous sio@xmath111 substrate we obtain @xmath114 for @xmath115 ns . for nbn on sio@xmath111 , a similar calculation yields @xmath116 for @xmath117 ns . with these estimates we conclude that phonon down - conversion noise even due to phonons of the first generation dominates fano fluctuations , @xmath118 .",
    "this is not surprising because the fluctuations of the number of phonons falling within the escape cone and the fluctuations of ultimate number of quasiparticles are both proportional to the square root of the respective mean numbers .",
    "fluctuations for athermal phonons are strong , partly because of their large energy and hence smaller numbers , but more importantly because only a significantly smaller fraction of all athermal phonons ( those within the escape cone ) contribute to fluctuations in the corresponding energy loss .",
    "the subsequent phonon generations also contribute to fluctuations increasing @xmath90 , although each subsequent contribution becomes smaller , because of the twofold increase of the number of phonons with every generation .",
    "thus , even if we overestimated @xmath109 , there is still an extra contribution due to lower energy phonons , so that most probably @xmath118 .",
    "because we can not provide credible estimates for contributions to overall variance from later phonon generations we will use @xmath119 as a fitting parameter .",
    "the likely range of variation of @xmath119 must be consistent with our estimate for @xmath109 .",
    "the down - conversion in a strongly disordered current - carrying nanowire is different from typical superconducting sensors with no significant disorder , such as superconducting tunnel junctions and many types of microwave kinetic inductance detectors . in these detectors ,",
    "the temperature of the hotspot does not rise close to the critical temperature @xmath127 even for photon energies as high as a few kev .",
    "the transport current is small compared to the de - pairing current and the order parameter stays close to its zero current - temperature value .",
    "therefore , the energy required to generate a quasiparticle is constant during the downconversion process , @xmath128 .",
    "by contrast , in an snspd at the edge of the transition to the normal state , the temperature of the hotspot reaches the critical value @xmath58 , while the order parameter remains nonzero at the level @xmath129 , but is significantly smaller than its zero temperature value for a given bias current . as a result , some of the non - pair - breaking phonons with energies below @xmath130 that were emitted shortly after photon absorption regain their pair - breaking capability later , when their energy starts exceeding the decreasing @xmath130 .",
    "this happens if down - conversion and thermalisation times are faster than phonon escape time from the film . in this asymptotic limit @xmath131 , and it decreases with bias current , while @xmath58 increases@xcite . the corresponding @xmath84 also decreases , resulting in a steeper rise of the @xmath0 vs @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence of the second contribution @xmath90 on @xmath1 is weaker , reflecting the fact that @xmath90 is the contribution from the initial generations of excitations when the order parameter is much less affected .",
    "therefore , to experimentally observe the bias dependence of the variance @xmath2 , @xmath84 and @xmath90 must be comparable in magnitude .",
    "this situation is easier to fulfil in larger gap nbn than in wsi .",
    "the other factor , @xmath126 , depends on bias current considerably stronger , because it is determined by a highly non - linear function of bias current @xmath121 , @xmath132 ( neglecting potential dependence of @xmath133 of @xmath1 ) .",
    "it can be analysed only numerically . with the factor @xmath134 being independent of bias current , or",
    "if estimating it at inflection points of experimental curves is a good approximation , then the predicted @xmath0 curves with any other parameters ( @xmath135 ) changing must exhibit parallel shifts along @xmath1 axis . with a stronger non - linear dependence of the factor @xmath134 on @xmath1 , the predicted @xmath0 curves will exhibit changes of slopes of the rising parts with onsets at different bias currents .",
    "moreover , in general @xmath134 is non - monotonic in the transition range .",
    "the four speculative patterns of @xmath0 vs @xmath1 can therefore be predicted as shown in fig.[fig:4 ] . while the pattern in fig.[fig:4]a is not uncommon ,",
    "the pattern resembling fig.[fig:4]d was observed experimentally in narrow , @xmath39=30 nm , nbn snspds@xcite .",
    "vs @xmath1,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +      in wide snspds , the sensor response depends on the @xmath75-coordinate of the absorption site across the nanowire . in a spatially homogeneous nanowire",
    "this dependence will affect the shape of the @xmath0 curves in the transition region , reflecting the curvature of the predicted dependence of detection current vs coordinate @xmath75 .",
    "two shapes of @xmath136 are discussed in the literature : bell - shaped @xcite and w - shaped@xcite .",

    "we obtain the @xmath0-curve shown in fig.[fig:5]b .",
    "fano - fluctuations will smear this curve .",
    "however , in order to evaluate this smearing , apart from the variance @xmath2 we must evaluate the sensitivity of @xmath139 relative to fluctuations of the deposited energy , the derivative in the denominator in ( [ pcrwide ] ) .",

    "as is seen , the difference between the two curves can be resolved experimentally allowing us to study the co - ordinate dependent response , on the background of either normally distributed static spatial inhomogeneities or dynamic fano - fluctuations .",
    "similarly , the distinguishing features of the @xmath0 curve for the bell - shaped profile of detection current can also be resolved experimentally .",
    "observation of smooth error function - like sigmoidal shapes in wide - wire snspds will indicate a much weaker co - ordinate dependence than shown in fig.[fig:5]a .",
    "such a weak co - ordinate dependence on its own can not be responsible for the observable width of the transition region , @xmath140 , @xmath141 . in this case the shapes of @xmath0 curves of wide - wire snspds will closely resemble @xmath0 curves of narrow - wire snspds .",

    "this profile is evidenced by the shape of the two - photon @xmath156 as a function of time delay between two single - photon pulses@xcite .       as a function of time delay @xmath155 for a series of bias currents : ( a ) experiment , ( b ) theory.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    as expected , fano fluctuations play a dominant role in shaping the photoresponse @xmath163 , also providing further evidence that in amorphous wsi nanowires hotspot relaxation proceeds via self - recombination . while the simulated curves in fig.[fig:6 ] can be better matched to the experimentally observed lorentzians over the hotspot lifetime defining range of time delays , their tails differ from experiment .",
    "the results of such a match are shown in fig.[fig:8 ] .",
    "for series of bias currents by the lorentzians.,title=\"fig:\",width=8 ] +    the simulated tails fall between that of lorentzian and gaussian .",
    "it is possible that diffusion makes most of its contribution at the tails of @xmath156 , causing reduced self - recombination at the periphery of the hotspot .",
    "simulations in fig.[fig:6 ] look reasonably close to experimental curves .",
    "they were done at parameter values close to our of earlier work@xcite assuming switching current @xmath166 less than de - paring current and correspondingly more efficient energy deposition parameter . in general larger difference between the switching and de - paring currents",
    "requires larger factors @xmath167 to match theory and experiment .",
    "physically that means that achieving the higher critical temperature in a wire with bias current being a smaller fraction of the de - paring current requires more deposited energy . also , decreasing @xmath164 and increasing @xmath167 results in a weaker dependence of hotspot relaxation time ( half width at half maximum ) on bias current as evidenced by a weaker dependence of hotspot relaxation time on @xmath1 at lower currents .",
    "this dependence becomes weaker also for larger values of @xmath15 .",
    "allowing @xmath164 to be free fitting parameter we may shift simulated @xmath0 curves along the bias current axis achieving better fit to experiment .",
    "these simulations must be considered together with best fits in fig.[fig:2 ] which required the same set of fitting parameters as for simulations in fig.[fig:6 ] except for @xmath164=0.6 . achieving good fit with the same material parameters and fixed values for @xmath164 , @xmath2 and @xmath167",
    "is very challenging .",
    "we could have fitted each separate experiment better allowing some flexibility of each individual parameter .",
    "the fact that we can semi - quantitatively fit all the different experiments , allowing @xmath168 variation of a single @xmath164 fitting parameter and keeping the rest the same , shows both the validity of the model and the accuracy of the main assumptions .",
    "simulation of @xmath156 for two - photon detection with variable time delay requires the two additional parameters , @xmath15 , determining the time scale , and cutoff temperature , determining the level of cooling of hotspot below which it can not be detected at arrival of the second photon .",
    "both parameters are irrelevant for single photon detection .",
    "it is important to note that for a given photon wavelength the ratio of cutoff to critical temperature @xmath58 is not an entirely independent parameter .",
    "it depends on the ratio of bias- to de - paring currents .",
    "however , this dependence is highly non - linear and its effect on simulations differs from the linear scaling of the bias relative to de - pairing current , which is sufficient for fitting single photon counting rates . in two - photon experiments with variable time delay , both linear re - scaling of the bias relative to depairing current and nonlinearity of ratio of @xmath169 to @xmath58 are important , and hence credibility of both sets of simulations depends on assumed applicability of bcs model .",
    "finally , the role of diffusion , which has not been discussed so far is also important .",
    "the simple model@xcite , although acknowledging its potential role , ignored it with some support from experimental data .",
    "our simulations of single - photon @xmath0-curves and two - photon pump - and - probe experiments with variable time delay were based on a narrow nanowire hot - belt model .",
    "the analogous hot - belt model was claimed to be irrelevant for both nbn and wsi snspds with nanowire width exceeding 150 nm@xcite .",
    "our experiments and simulations therefore allow testing of the hot - belt model predictions for a wide range of experiments and comparison to predictions of the hotspot model where we can identify expected differences .",
    "the hot belt model is expected to work for the two - photon detection experiment .",
    "it was demonstrated to produce qualitatively similar but quantitatively strongly different results to the hotspot model ( except for snspds in external magnetic fields in a certain range of bias currents ) .",
    "in contrast , the agreement with both experiments that comes as the result of our analysis is much closer than what could have been inferred on assumption that hot - belt and hotspot models work for two - photon and one - photon experiments respectively .",
    "the validity criterion for the narrow - wire model is @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the characteristic thermalisation time , controlling suppression of the gap within the initial volume , and @xmath172 is characteristic diffusion time across the nanowire@xcite .",
    "we do not use the coherence length as the radius @xmath173 of phonon bubble .",
    "this scale is not relevant for the initial state , because the radius of phonon bubble must be exactly the same for a normal metal .",
    "we chose @xmath174 as the more appropriate spacial scale . here",
    "@xmath175 stands for the descent time for photoelectron(hole ) from the level @xmath5 to fermi energy .",
    "the meaning of @xmath173 is the length of the random walk , that the primary photoelectron and hole perform while disposing their excess energy to phonons , creating a phonon bubble .",
    "the second term under the square root accounts for extra volume expansion due to phonons of the bubble moving on average a distance of their mean free path prior to being re - absorbed by electrons .",
    "for wsi using @xmath176 nm , @xmath177@xcite , @xmath178 ns , @xmath179 mev@xcite , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182=89 we obtain for volume of phonon bubble @xmath183=2044 nm@xmath184 exceeding initial volume used for the estimate of @xmath171 in ref.@xcite . correspondingly , the energy density is smaller resulting in lower temperature of of electrons and phonons in the hotspot @xmath185 and @xmath171=8.7 ps for absorption of a 1550 nm photon as estimated from energy conservation .",
    "there is currently no consensus in the literature regarding the magnitude of @xmath15 with recent measurements of magnetoresistance@xcite yielding @xmath15=1.9 ns . we have chosen @xmath15=10 ns for two reasons .",
    "it fits the measurements of electron - phonon relaxation time@xcite over the low temperature range .",
    "it also better fits the expected magnitude of @xmath15 inferred from scaling according to @xmath186 law , which must work during the formation of phonon bubble when effects of disorder on electron - phonon interactions are not important .",
    "phonon escape from the snspd film and diffusive expansion during thermalisation both reduce the energy density within the volume filled with non - equilibrium excitations resulting in further slowdown of thermalization .",
    "a more important process is likely to be diffusive expansion , which may result in a substantial increase of @xmath171 . indeed , during the first picosecond evolving hotspot with the initial volume of 2044 nm@xmath184 expands to fill the volume of 4700 nm@xmath184 .",
    "reducing energy density within the evolving hotspot results in the temperature of thermalised quasiparticles and phonons of @xmath187 and @xmath188 ps ( @xmath1899.5 ps if to assume @xmath15=5 ns ) .",
    "the representative value for expansion time of hotspot across the width of the wire is the diffusion time from the centre of the strip , @xmath190 ps . the account of both phonon loss and diffusion during the stage of thermalisation must be done within the refined model . in the absence of such a model and in view of significant uncertainty of material parameters",
    "the question of validity of one or the other model remains open .",
    "the experimental data in figs.[fig:2]a and b have smooth sigmoidal shapes close to predicted error functions .",
    "indeed , there is no evidence of coordinate - dependent response in the transition region . with any of the bell or w - shaped coordinate - dependent responses",
    ", one expects the specific change of curvature at the inflection point from concave below , @xmath191 , to convex above cutoff current , @xmath192 as shown in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "in contrast , for a narrow wire , the predicted error function shape is convex on the left and concave on the right of the inflection point , @xmath193 . in order to check whether the experimental curves in fig.[fig:2 ] can be approximated by error functions in fig.[fig:7 ]",
    "we show the results of matching the curves from fig.[fig:2 ] to error functions , @xmath194 , where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are fitting parameters .",
    "no clear signs of coordinate - dependent response are seen in fig.[fig:7 ] .",
    "vs @xmath1 for @xmath145 = 1200 , 1350 , 1450 , 1550 and 1650 nm by error functions .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] +    in a recent paper on mosi snspds , the @xmath0 curves were measured and fitted with error functions for a wavelength range of 750 to 2050 nm .",
    "it was found that at low photon energies the fit agrees very well with the data .",
    "however , at high energies , the shape of the curves starts to deviate from simple error function@xcite .",
    "the authors hypothesize that these deviations might indicate a coordinate - dependent response of the snspd .",
    "the observed deviations , however , are not what can be expected from coordinate - dependent response .",
    "firstly , the curvatures of @xmath0-shapes on both sides of inflection points remain consistent with fluctuation - induced homogeneous sensor response .",
    "secondly , the experimental curve shows smaller counts both in the lower bias tail and on approach to saturation level .",
    "this is not indicative of an inhomogenious response , for which on approach to @xmath197 photon counting rate must exhibit a discontinuity in its derivative .",
    "it is possible that the observed deviations are connected with non - linearity of snspd response as given by the function @xmath126 in expression ( [ pcrib ] ) .",
    "this non - linearity is of the same origin as the observed substantial non - linearity of current - energy relation in mosi@xcite .",
    "these results may be also explained within the hotspot model provided that detection current is only weakly dependent on coordinates of absorption site so that predictions of hotspot model for the shape of @xmath0 vs @xmath1 will be no different and both models further merge as explained in section ii .",
    "the effects of an external magnetic field on @xmath0 vs bias current@xcite deserve special attention , since they can give insight into the detection mechanisms in snspds@xcite .",
    "features due to fano fluctuations were not accounted for in any of the previous work .",
    "there are several ways that external magnetic fields can combine with fano fluctuations and thus cause the @xmath0 curves to change shape . in an external perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "the threshold @xmath56 depends on the field magnitude , as seen in ( [ threshold ] ) and ( [ pcr ] ) .",
    "both the critical current and the de - pairing energy depend on magnetic field , with the former being dominant for weak magnetic fields . with @xmath198 decreasing , while @xmath51 increases , the obvious effect in weak fields is the shift of @xmath0 curves towards lower currents , as observed in @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the shifts depends on the exact functional dependence of @xmath198 .",
    "vodolazov et al@xcite observed shape transformations of the @xmath0 curves with varying magnetic field and photon wavelength above the crossover current .",
    "their results were interpreted on the basis of a model assuming vortex trapping by compact hotspots having a radius depending on the photon wavelength . the snspd response in a weak magnetic field",
    "was suggested as the definitive experiment for identification of the detection mechanism@xcite . within our model with uniform current density , there is no such a crossover .",
    "nonetheless , the shifts may assume a more complicated pattern due to the interplay between the critical current , the de - pairing energy , and the complicated nonlinear @xmath153 dependence . at shorter photon wavelengths ,",
    "the @xmath0 curves shift towards lower bias , where the contribution of magnetic field term to depairing energy increases relative to the supercurrent term .",
    "significant non - linearity of the energy - current relation was recently reported over the spectral interval 750 - 2050 nm@xcite .",
    "a full understanding of the detection mechanisms in snspds will require a more detailed study of @xmath0 shapes through the transition range at the low current tail , near inflection point(s ) and close to saturation together with thorough study of the role of magnetic field affecting non - linearities of response and fano effect .",
    "in summary , we have shown that fano fluctuations play a fundamental role in superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors .",
    "they are an essential factor in determining the exact shape of both single - photon photoresponse and time - delayed , two - photon photoresponse .",
    "the special features of @xmath199 curves , such as slope transformation , positions of inflection point(s ) versus wavelength , bath temperature and magnetic field reveal a wealth of sensor physics and will do a significant service for unambiguous determination of the detection mechanism(s ) .",
