    "ever since the monolayer graphene was first successfully produced experimentally,@xcite intriguing properties from its strictly two - dimensional structure and massless dirac - like behavior of low - energy excitation have been intensively investigated.@xcite of particular interest are the graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) that are strips of graphene obtained by different methods , e.g. , high - resolution lithography,@xcite chemical means,@xcite or most recently the unzipping of carbon nanotubes.@xcite their semiconducting character with a tunable band gap sensitive to the structural size and geometry makes them good candidates for future electric and spintronic devices.@xcite gnrs are classified into two basic groups , namely , armchair and zigzag ones , according to edge termination types.@xcite in the framework of the nearest neighbor tight binding model , the zigzag gnrs are always metallic and exhibit special spin - polarized edge states.@xcite for the armchair gnrs with width @xmath0 ( as defined in fig .",
    "[ figtw1 ] ) , they are metallic when @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being an integer , and semiconducting otherwise.@xcite graphene field - effect transistors have been experimentally realized by making use of the band gap introduced in gnrs.@xcite however , large switching voltage up to several volts is needed due to the thick back - gate oxides used in these devices .",
    "moreover , the excellent feature of a tunable band gap in gnrs has not been used in the overall back - gate configuration.@xcite the electronic transport in gnr - based nanodevices has also be investigated theoretically.@xcite particular energy dependences of conductance , resulting from the interference effects , are reported in metallic gnrs@xcite or in semiconducting ones out of the gap regime.@xcite however , the robustness of these transport properties against disorder has been shown to be questionable.@xcite    in this work , we introduce two classes of structures based on gapped armchair gnrs by using either sidearm or on - site gate voltage , which allow `` on '' and `` off '' operations in the gap regime . a schematic view of the armchair gnr with one sidearm is shown in fig .",
    "[ figtw1 ] .",
    "other configurations , i.e. , with two sidearms , one or two on - site gate voltages , are shown together with the numerical results of transport behaviors in the following figures .",
    "such structures are within the reach of nowaday technology , i.e. , the patterned gnr can be obtained through high - resolution lithography@xcite and the contact@xcite and top - gate@xcite technologies are also well developed .",
    "it is noted that throughout this work , the width of the gnr is taken as @xmath3 , so there is a band gap in the pristine gnr.@xcite here the corresponding band gap is about @xmath4  mev .",
    "the two terminals of the gnr are connected to semi - infinite metal leads,@xcite which simulates the real experimental condition.@xcite such a configuration is crucial to access possible states in the gap regime of the gnr , due to the propagation modes in the metal leads which are otherwise absent in graphitic ones.@xcite meanwhile , the effective length of the sidearm can be electrically adjusted by a gate voltage ( not shown in the figure).@xcite we show that by increasing the length of the sidearm @xmath5 , or by increasing the strength of positive or negative on - site gate voltage in the configuration shown in fig .  [ figtw4](a ) , conduction peaks are introduced into the originally switched - off gap regime .",
    "the positions of these conduction peaks are determined by the gate voltage , which , in addition to the common property of switching on and off , allows us to selectively choose electrons of a particular energy while filter out the others .",
    "we further propose two schemes of structures with markedly improved robustness against disorder by employing two sidearms or on - site gates [ see fig .  [",

    "one notices that two conduction peaks from the positive and negative energy sides are introduced into the gap regime and moving towards the dirac point symmetrically .",
    "they correspond to n- and p - type channels , respectively . in order to elucidate this behavior",

    "it is noted that the states with eigenenergies at the dirac point are the localized edge states in the zigzag terminals,@xcite which do not really exist when the terminals are connected to the metal leads .",

    "[ figtw3](a ) , close correspondence between the positions of the conduction peaks and those of the eigenenergies is seen .",
    "we hence conclude that the transport behavior in this structure of a small size can be understood as resonant tunneling through the gnr via the confined states therein .",
    "we then examine how the conduction peaks induced by the sidearm are influenced by the total length of the gnr . from fig .",
    "[ figtw2](b ) , one observes that the positions of conduction peaks are insensitive to the total length of the gnr .",
    "this suggests that the states which contribute to the conduction peaks distribute mainly in the sidearm region .",
    "moreover , with the increase of the total length of the gnr , the confined states are less coupled to the leads . as a result ,",
    "the conduction peaks are narrowed and the transmissions in the gap regime other than the conduction peaks are suppressed .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtw2](c ) , a wider sidearm is more effective in bringing conduction peaks into the gap regime .",
    "it is illustrative to perform a spatial analysis of the conductance . in fig .",
    "[ figtw3](b ) , we plot the local density of states in the gnr corresponding to the right conduction peak shown in fig .",

    "[ figtw3](c ) for the same condition but without the sidearm .",
    "one observes that distinct from the case without the sidearm where the electronic state is restricted in the vicinities of the two terminals , the state contributing to the conduction peak indeed mostly distributes in the sidearm region .",
    "this kind of bound states have been discussed by sevinli _",
    "et al_.@xcite and prezzi _",
    "et al_.@xcite in the superlattice structures of gnr .",
    "the underlying physics is that , since the energy band gap of armchair gnr shows strong dependence on the ribbon width , one can fabricate structures similar to the conventional semiconductor heterojunctions by joining gnrs with different widths . in the condition shown in fig .",
    "[ figtw3](b ) , segments of armchair gnrs with widths @xmath3 , 25 and 21 are joined together .",
    "the band gaps of the corresponding infinite gnrs with the same widths are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath35  mev , respectively .",
    "therefore , the gnr with one sidearm resembles the quantum well structure in semiconductors with conduction- and valence - band offset @xmath37  mev , and hence the bound states are formed therein .",

    "[ figtw4](a ) , we apply a positive ( negative ) voltage in the framed region by a top gate@xcite which acts as a well potential to electrons ( holes ) .",
    "the transmissions as function of the fermi energy are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figtw4](b ) for different values of the gate voltage .",
    "one observes that by increasing the strength of positive ( negative ) gate voltage , a conduction peak enters the gap regime from the right ( left ) and moves towards the left ( right ) .",

    "that here one can introduce only one conduction peak into gap regime with its position fully determined by the gate voltage , this configuration has the advantage to serve as an energy filter .",
    "the influences of the width of the gate region and the total length of the gnr on the induced conduction peaks resemble the case with one sidearm , and are not explicitly plotted .      due to the fact that the conduction peaks introduced into the gap regime are extremely sharp in the above two configurations and hence are easily destroyed by disorders as we will show below ,",
    "we further propose two schemes of structures to improve the robustness , i.e. , by employing two sidearms or gate voltages shown in fig .",
    "[ figtw5](a ) and ( d).@xcite it is noted that here we fix the total length of the gnrs @xmath40 and the total width of the two sidearms or the gates is set to be the same width of the sidearm or gate region in the previous configurations . in searching for the best performance of the devices , i.e. , a wide conduction window , we vary the spacing length @xmath41 between the two sidearms or gate regions to modify the interference between tunnelings via the two ( quasi-)bound states from the dual structure .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figtw5](b ) and ( e ) , for the situations with two sidearms and two gates , respectively .",
    "it is found that for both cases with @xmath42 , a conduction plateau is formed with a wide energy window up to 50  mev centered around @xmath43  mev ( red solid curves in the figure ) .",
    "such a wide conduction window in the original gate region allows a large current in the `` on '' state of the proposed device which is of potential use for high performance field - effect transistors .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtw5](c ) and ( f ) , the positions of the conduction plateaus can be controlled by the length of the sidearms and by on - site gate voltage , respectively .",
    "so the excellent feature of controlled modification of the conduction window is preserved in the dual structures .",

    "[ figtw5](a ) ] , respectively ; ( c ) and ( d ) with one and two one - site gate voltages [ corresponding to gnr structures shown in fig .  [ figtw4](a ) and fig .",

    "all necessary parameters are indicated in the corresponding figures.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    we now show the feasibility of the above proposed devices for real application by analyzing the robustness of the switch - off character , and more importantly the conduction peaks and plateaus against the anderson disorder.@xcite in our simulation , the anderson disorder is created out by introducing random on - site energy at the carbon atoms : @xmath45 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gnr ] ) ] . here",
    "@xmath44 is the disorder strength and @xmath46 is a random number with a uniform probability distribution in the range @xmath47 .",
    "the converged transmissions are obtained by averaging over 100 random configurations.@xcite the results of pristine gnr without a sidearm or on - site gate voltage are plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figtw6](a ) .",
    "one notices that under different strength of disorder , all five curves almost coincide with each other .",
    "this indicates that the gap behavior is very robust against disorder , which ensures extremely small leakage current in the `` off '' state of the device .",
    "we then turn to check the robustness of the `` on '' state of the proposed structures . by comparing the corresponding curves in fig .",
    "[ figtw6](a ) and ( b ) , one finds that the conduction peaks from one sidearm rapidly decrease with the strength of the disorder whereas the conduction plateaus from two sidearms are more sustained .",
    "the latters are only reduced by about @xmath48 for the largest disorder strength @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the robustness is immensely improved by using two sidearms to introduce a wide conduction window into the gap regime .",
    "the situation for configurations with one or two gate voltages is similar .",
    "so we only plot our results in fig .",
    "[ figtw6](c ) and ( d ) without more discussions . in this way",
    ", we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed devices for both `` on '' and `` off '' states .",
    "in summary , we have proposed two schemes for field - effect transistor , which may also work as energy filter , by studying transport properties in the gnr - based structures with sidearms or on - site gate voltages .",
    "gapped armchair gnrs are employed with the band gap used as a natural `` off '' state of the transistor .",
    "metal leads are employed so that by further introducing a sidearm or on - site gate voltage to the gnr , one is able to access the gap regime with conduction peaks . moreover , by employing two sidearms or on - site gate voltages , we obtain much wider conduction windows with the transmission close to one , which allows a large `` on '' current . we show that the positions of the conduction peaks or plateaus can be controlled by the length of the sidearm ( which can be modulated by a gate voltage ) , or by the voltage of the on - site gates on the gnr .",
    "this property enables the proposed devices not only serve as a common transistor with large on / off ratio , but also as an energy filter .",
    "we further demonstrate the robustness of both the `` off '' and `` on '' states of the devices against disorder .",
    "the excellent switch - off ability , the wide conduction window of `` on '' state which allows controlled modifications and the high robustness against disorder suggest that the proposed structures have great potential to work as high performance field - effect transistor in reality .",
