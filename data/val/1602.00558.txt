    "modern astronomical observations with increasing evidence ( such as high redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , matter power spectra , observational hubble parameter data ( ohd ) , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , etc . ) have strongly suggested that the universe is undergoing an accelerated phase at present@xcite . to explain the accelerated mechanism ,",
    "cosmologists have proposed a new negative pressure fluid named dark energy .",
    "the simplest candidate of dark energy is the so - called cosmological constant , namely , @xmath1cdm model , which is proved to be very successful in describing many aspects of the observed universe .",
    "for instance , the spectrum of anisotropies of the cmbr , the large scale structure of matter distribution at linear level ( lss ) , and the expansion phenomena are very well described by the standard cosmological model . however , this model has faced two fatal problems , namely , the `` fine - tuning '' problem and the `` coincidence '' problem @xcite .",
    "the former indicates that theoretical estimates for the vacuum density are many orders of magnitude larger than its observed value , i.e. , the famous 120-orders - of - magnitude discrepancy that makes the vacuum explanation suspicious , while the latter implies that why the dark energy and dark matter are at the same order today since the energy densities of them are so different during the evolution of the universe .",
    "in addition , a positive cosmological constant is inconsistent with perturbed string theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the realistic nature of dark energy should not be simply the cosmological constant @xmath1 ( interpreting it as quantum vacuum ) . in recent years , to alleviate or even solve these two problems , cosmologists have proposed a variety of dark energy models , partly as follows    @xmath2 exotic equation of state : a linear equation of state @xcite , van der waals equation of state @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , modified chaplygin gas @xcite , superfluid chaplygin gas @xcite , inhomogeneous equation of state @xcite , barotropic fluid model @xcite , cardassian model @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 viscosity : bulk viscosity in the isotropic space , bulk and shear viscosity in the anisotropic space @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the perfect fluid that occurs in many papers is just an approximation of the universe media . nowadays ,",
    "all the observations indicate that the universe media is not an idealized fluid and the viscosity is investigated in the evolution of the universe .",

    "are depicted unsatisfied since there are too many .",
    "hereafter , we plan to focus our attention on the geometric contributions , concretely the so - called ricci dark energy model based on the holographic principle .",
    "although a complete quantum gravity theory ( qgt ) has not been developed , we could still explore partly the nature of the dark energy by using the holographic principle which acts as an important result of present qgt ( or sting theory ) for gravity phenomena .",
    "thus , holographic dark energy model ( hde ) constructed in light of the holographic principle can bring us a new perspective about the underlying theory of dark energy .",
    "recently , gao at al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new hde model called ricci dark energy model ( rde ) , in which the future event horizon area is replaced by the inverse of the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "they have shown this model does not only avoid the causality problem , phenomenologically viable , but also naturally solves the coincidence problem .    in the present situation ,",
    "we plan to investigate the astrophysical scales property ( wormholes ) of the rde in the universe evolution background and its dependence on the evolution characters of the universe through assuming the dark energy fluid is permeated everywhere .",
    "in particular , it is worth noting that , as our previous works @xcite , existence of wormholes is always an important problem in physics both at micro and macro scales .",
    "there is no doubt that , wormholes together with black holes , pulsars ( physical neutron stars ) and white dwarfs @xcite , etc .",
    ", constitute the most attractive , extreme , strange and puzzling astrophysical objects that may provide a new window for physics discovery .",
    "hence , it is necessary to make a brief review about wormholes as follows .",
    "wormholes could be defined as handles or tunnels in the spacetime topology linking widely separated regions of our universe or of different universes altogether @xcite .",
    "the most fundamental ingredient to form a wormhole is violating the null energy condition ( nec ) , i.e. , @xmath3 , and consequently all of other energy conditions , where @xmath4 is the stress - energy tensor and @xmath5 any future directed null vector . in general , wormholes in the literature at present can be divided into three classes :    @xmath2 ordinary wormholes : this class just satisfy the violation of the nec and is usually not asymptotically flat , singular and consequently non - traversable .",
    "@xmath2 traversable wormholes : in light of ordinary wormholes , one can obtain the traversable wormholes by an appropriate choice of redshift function or shape function .",
    "subsequently , one can analyze conveniently the traversability conditions of the wormholes and the stabilities .",
    "@xmath2 thin shell wormholes : one can theoretically construct a geodesically complete traversable wormhole with a shell placed in the junction surface by using the so - called cut - and - paste technique .",
    "this class has attracted much attention since the exotic matter required for the existence of spacetime configuration is only located at the shell , and it avoids very naturally the occurrence of any horizon .",
    "wormholes like other extreme astrophysical objects also have a long theoretical formation history .",
    "the earliest remarkable contribution we are aware of is the 1935 introduction of the object now referred to as einstein - rosen bridge @xcite .",
    "twenty years later , wheeler first introduced the famous idea of `` spacetime foam '' and coined the term `` wormhole '' @xcite .",
    "the actual revival of this field is based on the 1988 paper by morris and thorne @xcite , in which they analyzed for details the construction of the wormhole , energy conditions , time machines , stability problem , and traversabilities of the wormholes . in succession , visser and possion",
    "introduce the famous `` thin shell wormholes '' by conjecturing that all `` exotic matter '' is confined to a thin shell between universes @xcite .",
    "after that , there were a lot of papers to investigate the above three classes of wormholes and related properties .    in the past few years , in light of the important discovery that our universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion , an increasing interest to these subjects ( wormholes ) has arisen significantly in connection with the global cosmology scale discovery . due to the violation of nec in both cases ( astrophysics wormholes and cosmic dark energy for simple terms ) ,",
    "an unexpected and subtle overlap between the two seemingly separated subjects occurs . to be precise",
    ", one can usually parameterize the dark energy behaviors by an equation of state of this form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spatially homogeneous pressure and @xmath8 the energy density of the dark energy . in combination with the second friedmann equation",
    ", one can knows that @xmath9 is a necessary condition for the cosmic acceleration expansion , @xmath10 case is coined to be the quintessence region , @xmath11 is the well - known cosmological constant case ( also named phantom divide or cosmic barrier ) and the @xmath12 case corresponds to the phantom region . at the same time , we can easily find that in the phantom range , the nec is naturally violated .",
    "thus , whatever mysterious dark energy model , if one expects to explore the special wormhole solutions , one must have the phantom case or -like the equation of state properties , from the real cosmic background evolutions with relevant dark energy models .    in this letter , we plan to investigate the specific geometric rde wormholes corresponding to a non - ideal equation of state .",
    "in particular , traversable wormholes ( the second class ) , whose existence could provide an effective tool for the rapid interstellar travel ( another interesting topic for fundamental physics beyond this present work scope ) , may be of much more interest to causal physics development .",
    "so we would like to be aim at studying rde traversable wormholes since they may contain more constructive physics insights .",
    "especially , it is noteworthy that , the most important result in this letter is that we explore the traversable wormholes constrained by modern astronomical observations , i.e. , constraining the equation of state parameters with the cosmic proper evolution stages by using the various astrophysical data - sets ( sne ia @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite and ohd @xcite ) , which seems to be the first try in the literature",
    ". therefore , one can determine when the exotic matter appears with the evolution of the global universe background in dark energy dominated cosmological models . as a result , one can obtain a substantially clear picture about in which stage of the the evolution of the universe , the wormholes can exist ( open ) and/or maybe disappear ( close ) in another different stage .",
    "this new connection , to our knowledge , which never be clarified by other authors in the previous literatures about wormholes study , between the wormhole physics and exact cosmology modelings can give us a completely new perspective to investigate the evolution behavior of the wormholes spacetime configurations .",
    "the present paper is organized in the following contexts . in the next section ,",
    "we make a brief review on the rde model . in section . , we constrain the rde model by the sne ia , bao and ohd data - sets . in section .",
    "iv , we present a general solution of a traversable wormhole supported by rde cosmological fluid . in section .",
    "v , we have investigated several specific wormhole geometries and their physical properties and characteristics , including three special choices for redshift function , a specific choice for the shape function , a constant energy density and , finally , isotropic pressure case . in section .",
    "vi , we make a discussion , point out the possible future direction and conclude the present efforts ( we adopt the units @xmath13 in the following contents ) .",

    "cohen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an unknown vacuum energy model according to the holographic principle , in which the fine - tuning problem at the cosmological scale as the dark energy and the coincidence problem is also alleviated . but",
    "this model has an essential defect , the universe is decelerating and the effective equation of state parameter is zero .",
    "subsequently , fischler et al . @xcite proposed the particle horizon could be used as the length scale . nonetheless , as hsu @xcite and li @xcite pointed out , the equation of state parameter is still greater than @xmath15 , so this model could not explain the expansion mechanism of the universe . for this reason ,",
    "li proposed the future event horizon could be used as the characteristic length .",

    "it is more noteworthy that , we think , the three choices of the redshift function can give us a mathematical paradigm as eq . ( 44 ) .",
    "this means , at the throat @xmath187 , the violation of the nec can provide the same result for us ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "furthermore , these three wormholes have a high degeneracy at the same throat .",
    "more physically , when three different travelers cross the throats of three different wormholes at the same moment , respectively , they may see the same bending of light and feel the same radial pressure , gravitation acceleration , etc .",
    "in addition , if we take the parameter @xmath165 once again , then , @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the introduction of the astrophysical observations will provide more useful information to investigate the behavior of the objects .",

    "( 66 ) is finite in the range ( 64 ) .",

    "furthermore , as before , we make a plot to illustrate the dimensions of this wormhole is substantially finite ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out one can still construct a traversable wormhole by matching the interior geometry to an exterior vacuum geometry .",

    "moreover , one may discover that the dimensions of wormholes are substantially finite . ]",
    "since the elegant discovery that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion , cosmologists have proposed many alternatives to explain the accelerated mechanism , which mainly include two classes : physical dark energy models and extended theories of gravity . actually , one can find that the two classes of models are physically equivalent by rearranging the terms in the einstein field equations .",
    "up to now , we still do not determine what the nature of dark energy is . in this letter",
    ", we are very interested in exploring the wormhole physics of the rde model , which is one of these popular dark energy models , by assuming the dark energy is distributed homogeneously in the whole spacetime .    in the past few years , there are a lot of papers investigating the wormholes spacetime and constraining the model parameters for various kinds of dark energy models .",
    "but , there is no one to study wormholes by using the astrophysical observations as the data support . in particular",
    ", we can discover , through the constraints of observations data - sets to some well known dark energy model , the evolution behavior of the equation of state parameter during the whole history of the universe could be well studied quantitatively . to be more precise ,",
    "when the nec is violated , namely , the equation of state parameter is less than @xmath223 , wormholes may appear ( open ) . since we think the astrophysical observations contain the most realistic physics , so we introduce naturally the astrophysical observations into the wormhole research , which seems to be the first try in the literature . for an concrete instance , we explore the traversable wormholes in the rde model .    in the present paper , we make a brief review on the rde model and constrain this model by astrophysical observations .",
    "subsequently , we find out the best fitting values of the parameters in this model by using the usual @xmath39 statistics , in order that we can know more about the evolution behavior of the universe and determine the evolution of the effective equation of state parameter @xmath85 with time .",
    "then , one can investigate the rde traversable wormholes better after an accurate equation of state is obtained .",
    "we have analyzed the effective equation of state of the rde model and give the constraint relation of the parameters by using the flaring out conditions .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated some specific solutions and the related physical properties and characteristics by considering three different redshift functions , one specific shape function , constant dark energy density and isotropic pressure . in the first case ,",
    "we find that the traversable wormhole dimension is finite and calculate out the traversal velocity and traversal time derived from the so - called traversability conditions for a interstellar traveler . in the second one",
    ", we quantify the `` total amount '' of energy condition violating matter by computing the `` volume integral quantifier '' , and find that one may theoretically construct a traversable wormhole with infinitesimal amounts of anec violating rde matter . in the third case , we get a mathematical paradigm by computing @xmath174 in the first three cases , and provide some interesting physical explanations .",
    "actually , this paradigm also can be obtained from the violation of the nec evaluated at the throat , namely , @xmath124 . in the fourth case",
    ", we consider a specific shape function and obtain a traversable wormhole by matching the interior spacetime into an exterior vacuum spacetime .",
    "the fifth case also reflects a non - asymptotically flat spacetime , where the exotic matter from the rde fluids is distributed in the vicinity of the throat . for the case of isotropic pressure",
    ", one may discover that the dimensions of wormholes is substantially finite .",
    "after the general relativity s centennial , we are still confused with the attractive and mysterious nature of dark energy and dark matter in different scales , if we assume the dark sector is permeated everywhere in the whole universe .",
    "wormholes are theoretically objects in the universe which now appear to attract more observational astrophysics interests and may provide a new window for new physics .",
    "in this situation , we apply the astrophysical data - sets into the wormhole physics and investigate six specific solutions quantitatively , which seems to be the first time in the wormhole research . through astronomical observations",
    ", one can make a constraint on the parameters of a cosmological model , explore the type of cosmic matter in different stages of the universe , limit the number of available models for wormhole research , reduce the number of the wormholes corresponding to different parameters for a concrete cosmological model and provide a more clear picture for wormhole research from the new perspective of observational cosmology backgroud .",
    "the future work could be to consider an obvious relation between the energy density and the transverse pressure , explore the profound connection between wormholes and energy conditions , and investigate the evolution of wormhole structure with time .",
