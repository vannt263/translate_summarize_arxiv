    "string field theory is a fascinating formulation to investigate non - perturbative aspects of string theory .",
    "the progress in the last three years in string field theory @xcite , which has been brought by calculational techniques of level truncation scheme @xcite , enables us to describe the decay process of d - branes in terms of classical solutions in the theory .",
    "one of the most interesting facts in open string field theory is that , as pointed out at the early stage formulating covariant string field theories @xcite , closed strings are concealed in the theory as a bound state of the open string , because open string loop diagrams look like closed string propagations if we change time - slice .",
    "indeed we can see a tower of closed string poles explicitly in non - planar one loop amplitudes @xcite . while there are some recent works related to closed strings in open string field theory @xcite , the nature of closed strings in the theory is not fully clear . in particular , we can not identify closed strings with asymptotic states in open string field theory , though such states are required by unitarity of the theory .",
    "if we introduce on - shell closed strings as gauge invariant operators in open string field theory , the theory generates a single cover of moduli space of riemann surfaces with punctures and boundaries @xcite .",
    "however , we can not produce purely closed string amplitudes in the theory .    in order to describe purely closed string processes ,",
    "an interesting proposal was made in the papers @xcite by drukker .",
    "if we obtain the tachyon vacuum solution and the theory expanded around the solution , we may reproduce closed string amplitudes by the feynman rules of the theory with the gauge invariant operators as sources . because the propagator in the theory around the solution does not generate any propagation of boundaries of strings .",
    "for this scenario , a possible candidate for the solution was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and some desirable results were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the gauge invariant operators corresponding to on - shell closed string states in order to develop techniques for describing purely closed string processes .",
    "intuitively we expect that the operators can be constructed by locating a closed string vertex operator at the midpoint on the identity string field .",
    "there are , however , some subtleties that ghost operators in the vertex operators diverge at the midpoint . to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "a regularization method is proposed in ref .",
    "we show that this regularized gauge invariant operator agrees with the operator defined by the method of conformal field theory .    in section 2",
    ", we define the gauge invariant operators making use of conformal field theory .",
    "we extend the operator for the closed string tachyon given in ref .",
    "@xcite to that of d - branes background . in section 3",
    ", we calculate a two closed string tachyon amplitude using the feynman rules and the gauge invariant operator . mapping the world sheet into a whole complex plane explicitly ,",
    "we show that the amplitude derived from the gauge invariant operator agrees with the usual disc amplitude .",
    "moreover , we calculate the amplitude using the operator formalism and we find that the result agrees with the same amplitude .",
    "we give summary and discussion in section 4 .",
    "open string field theory with a midpoint interaction is defined by the action @xcite @xmath0 we can incorporate closed strings in the theory by adding a source term to the action @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 corresponds to an on - shell closed string state .",
    "the feynman rules derived from the action provide a single cover of moduli space of open and closed strings amplitudes @xcite .",
    "intuitively , we expect that this source term is represented by a closed string vertex operator on the identity string field @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a closed string vertex operator @xmath5 however , the midpoint ghost insertion has a singularity on the identity and then we must regularize this expression to be well - defined . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is proposed that a regulated source term should be defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the state in which the anti - ghost factors of the identity state are removed . in this definition , we does not include the infinite factor arising from the commutator of the ghost and anti - ghost fields .    if faithful to ref .",
    "@xcite , we should define closed string sources in terms of conformal field theory .",
    "first we define the state @xmath8 for the closed vertex operator @xmath4 as @xmath9\\,\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the state @xmath10 is created by an operator as @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the conformal transformation induced by the function @xmath13 , which maps a unit half disc to an upper half plane @xcite , and @xmath14 denotes correlation function on the upper half plane . using this state",
    ", we should define the closed string source term as @xmath15 by definition , it is easily seen that this source term is a gauge invariant operator .",
    "moreover , it is known that a correct amplitude is reproduced by level truncation analysis based on this definition.@xcite    from ( [ eq : def ] ) , the gauge invariant operator for a closed string tachyon is defined as @xmath16\\,\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the correlation function is defined on the whole complex plane using the standard doubling trick . here , we consider string field theory on a d_p _ brane and then we impose neumann boundary conditions to @xmath17 and dirichlet boundary conditions to @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the momenta in tangential and orthogonal directions to a d_p _ brane , respectively .    from the definition ( [ eq : deftachyon ] ) , the oscillator expression of the gauge invariant operators for a closed string tachyon is given by @xmath21{\\left| \\psi \\right>}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a extended expression from that of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case that contains dirichlet directions .",
    "the detail derivation of this expression will appear in a forthcoming paper @xcite . here , we only comment on the brs invariance of this state . though the brs invariance is manifest by the definition ( [ eq : deftachyon ] ) , we can check it explicitly by the oscillator expression . from ( [ eq : tachyonstate ] ) , we find @xmath22 where the operator @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 using the matter virasoro generators @xmath25 .",
    "similarly we obtain @xmath26 . therefore using the method in refs .",
    "@xcite , we conclude that , if we impose the on - shell condition @xmath27 , the state ( [ eq : tachyonstate ] ) is brs invariant even for the case containing the dirichlet directions .",
    "we consider the closed tachyon amplitude derived from the source term ( [ eq : deftachyon ] ) .",
    "the simplest example is derived from the diagram connecting two tachyon sources by an open string propagator : @xmath28    gluing the two surface states by an open string , we find the world sheet corresponding to the integrand in this amplitude as depicted in fig  [ fig : map1 ] .",
    "we introduce the coordinate @xmath29 into this world sheet : the tachyon vertices insert on @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the points @xmath32 and @xmath33 are identified with each other at the boundaries @xmath34 .        consequently , we can rewrite the amplitude as @xmath35 where we use the doubling trick and the contour @xmath36 is a path from @xmath37 to @xmath38 at an arbitrary @xmath39 , and @xmath40 denotes correlation function on the @xmath41 plane .    since the @xmath41 plane is topologically equivalent to a disc or after the doubling trick to a sphere , it is more convenient to map the @xmath41 plane to an upper half or a whole complex plane",
    ". first we rotate the @xmath41 plane 90 degrees and put it on a region in the @xmath42 plane as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : map2 ] .     and @xmath43 planes for the two closed tachyon amplitude.,width=491 ]    in the @xmath42 plane the left ( right ) region of the imaginary axis corresponds to the holomorphic ( anti - holomorphic ) part of the open string , and the closed tachyon vertices are inserted at the points c , d and their anti - holomorphic counter - points .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath39 as @xmath44 .",
    "we can transform this region in the @xmath42 plane to a whole complex @xmath43 plane by the mapping @xmath45 where @xmath46 are theta functions with periods @xmath47 and @xmath39 @xcite . using properties of theta functions , we find the relations @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and also that @xmath43 is imaginary if @xmath42 is real .",
    "therefore we find a cut from @xmath51 to @xmath52 in the @xmath43 plane and this cut corresponds to the identification of ac and a@xmath53c in the @xmath42 plane .",
    "the points @xmath54 are the insertion points of the closed tachyon vertices in the @xmath43 plane and they are expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 denote @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "moreover we can derive the relation @xmath58 and then we find another cut from the points @xmath59 and @xmath60 to the infinity along the imaginary axis .",
    "we can see also that the open string boundary in the @xmath42 plane corresponds to the real axis in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "the function @xmath61 satisfies @xcite",
    "@xmath62 this differential equation implies that the function @xmath61 is an elliptic function with the branch points @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the @xmath43 plane @xcite .",
    "indeed the function @xmath61 is an doubly - periodic function with periods @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "since the domain now considered in the @xmath42 plane is half of the fundamental parallelogram , it is clear that the domain is mapped to half domain of two sheets , in this case the whole complex plane . in addition , from the differential equation , it follows that @xmath67 near @xmath68 .",
    "then , if @xmath43 rotates by @xmath65 around @xmath69 , @xmath42 rotates by @xmath70 around its corresponding point , which is a conical singularity in the @xmath42 plane and the vertex insertion point @xcite .",
    "thus we can map the domain in fig .",
    "[ fig : map2 ] to the complex plane .",
    "now that the conformal mapping is established , we can calculate the amplitude in the @xmath43 plane . by the mapping",
    "@xmath61 the amplitude ( [ eq : amp3 ] ) is transformed to @xmath71 where conformal factors cancel using the on - shell condition , and the contour @xmath72 encircles the points @xmath73 and @xmath74 as depicted in fig .",

    "the matter correlation function is calculated as @xmath84 where the string coordinates of the neumann directions are given by @xmath85 and that of the dirichlet directions are given by @xmath86 .",
    "the correlation functions are calculated in terms of the propagators @xmath87 here , we have defined kinematical invariants as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and we have used the on - shell condition and the momentum conservation @xmath90 .    the ghost correlation function is obtained as @xmath91 where we have used the differential equation ( [ eq : difeq ] ) .",
    "using this result , we can perform the contour integration in ( [ eq : amp4 ] ) : @xmath92    next we evaluate @xmath93 , which appears when we change the moduli parameter from @xmath80 to @xmath83 .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is given by @xmath94 . then we find @xmath95 where we have used the equations @xmath96 and @xmath97 . by primes .",
