    "one of the open questions in modern astronomy is to understand when galaxies acquired their morphology and how star formation and morphology correlates .",
    "are star - forming galaxies at higher@xmath9 , such as lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , related to local starburst galaxies or are there evolutionary effects that prevent correlating the two populations ?",
    "heckman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) attempted to identify the local equivalents of lbgs using images from the uv - satellite galex and spectroscopy from the sdss .",
    "they found a class of nearby ( @xmath10 ) uv luminous compact starburst galaxies ( compact uvlgs ) which resembles the lbgs at @xmath11 .",
    "no local galaxy population meets the uv luminous criteria which makes these objects a class of scaled - up unobscured starbursts just as lbgs . if these objects are common out to @xmath12 they could contribute significantly to the rise of the star - formation rate density in the universe .",
    "recently , burgarella et al . (",
    "2006 ) using galex , spitzer , hst and ground - based telescopes , selected a sample of @xmath1300 far - uv dropouts in the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) which resembles lbgs at @xmath13 .",
    "their sample contains not only uvlgs but also lower luminosity lbgs .",
    "however , they were able to obtain morphology for only 36 lbgs since only 1/4 of their galex field was observed with hst . in this article , we provide a sample of 268 near - uv sources detected in the two great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) fields for which there is extensive multiwavelength coverage .",
    "our goal is to select enough star - forming galaxies at intermediate@xmath9 in order to characterize their role in galaxy evolution .",
    "during the goods campaign with hst we implemented a wfpc2 pure parallel program aimed at covering the lack of u  band observations with acs and maximizing the synergy between the parallels and the prime instrument .",
    "we took near - uv images with the f300w filter ( u band with @xmath14 = 2920  ) in parallel of both fields from december 2002 until march 2003 .",
    "goods / hst images , aiming also at searching for high@xmath9 supernovae ( strolger et al .",
    "2004 ) , were taken in five repeat visits separated by approximately 45 days .",
    "the two goods fields were observed with the f435w ( b ) , f606w ( v ) , f775w ( i ) , and f850lp ( z ) filters .",
    "the exposure times were 3 , 2.5 , 2.5 and 5 orbits per filter , respectively .",
    "the observations included the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) and the cdf - s and each field had 15 acs fields of view which makes goods 320 arcmin@xmath15 .    due to the multi - epoch nature of the goods observations the wfpc2 coverage was not uniform and covered @xmath1 88% of the two fields .",

    "the quality of the drizzled image was checked by analyzing the psf of a few stars present in some of the images .",
    "a total of 30 wfpc2 drizzled images of the goods - south field and 25 of the goods - north field were produced .",

    "we detected sources on the drizzled images using sextractor v2.2.2 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 , hereafter se ) .",
    "our detection criterion was that a source must exceed a @xmath21 sky threshold in 5 contiguous pixels and we also used a detection filter with a gaussian fwhm of 4 pixels .",
    "we used se s mag@xmath22auto , which is calculated using a flexible elliptical aperture around every detected object , and obtained the magnitude error , @xmath23 m , using se s rms calculated with background@xmath22rms .",
    "the next step was to match the wfpc2 u  band coordinates with the goods acs detections .",
    "the goods catalog is z  band based with matched aperture photometry in the acs b , v , i bands .",
    "we adopted a maximum offset radius of 1.5 arcsec between the wfpc2 and acs coordinates . in this paper",
    "we analyze only the u  band selected objects which have acs counterparts . due to the shallowness and the heterogeneous nature of the parallel data we decided to focus on the bright - end by imposing a conservative magnitude limit to the sample .",
    "the magnitude limit mag@xmath22auto  @xmath16  24.5 and error @xmath23m@xmath24(f300w )  @xmath16  0.10 were set to guarantee a clear identification even in the shallowest f300w images .",
    "the final catalog has 130 objects in the goods - s and 138 in the goods - n .",

    "the imposed magnitude limit at 24.5 we included two faint objects with magnitudes lower than the limit ( mag@xmath22auto=25.63 and 25.96 ) since they are in the deepest f300w image and the @xmath23m@xmath24(f300w ) are @xmath16  0.10 .",
    "we have identified 42 objects as stars based on their surface brightness versus magnitude relation .",
    "a total of 32 are in the southern field and 10 in the northern field .",
    "some of these objects are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) but are not further analyzed in this paper .    for comparison , the deepest near - uv image , obtained with 323.1 ks of hst time as part of the parallel observations of the hubble ultra deep field campaign ( de mello et al .",
    "2006 ) , has 415 objects down to m@xmath24(f300w)=27.5 , which is 0.5 magnitudes deeper than the 45 hst / wfpc2(f300w ) orbits dedicated to the original hdf - n .",
    "we have searched for differences in the magnitude distributions of the northern and southern fields that could be present due to cosmic variance ( somerville et al . 2004 ) and found no significant difference between the two fields .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic gives less than 10% confidence that these two fields are drawn from different magnitude distributions , if we discard the stars on both samples .",
    "the fact that the southern field contains @xmath25 three times more stars than the northern field , shifts the average values of the southern sample towards brighter magnitudes and lowers the ks confidence level .",

    "we have checked the four objects with the most discrepant redshifts and concluded that the main reason for the discrepancy is due to either the presence of bright companions which makes the photometry of the objects less accurate , or to confusion on the slit when the spectra were taken .",
    "the distribution of the spectral types ( st ) which were obtained from the template fitting when deriving the photometric redshifts are shown in fig .",
    "[ histst ] .",
    "as expected in the case of uv - selected samples , the majority ( @xmath148% ) of the objects are starbursts ( st@xmath304.5 ) .",
    "in fact , the fraction of starbursts could be even higher since a starburst galaxy with a high internal extinction has a redder sed and may be shifted to a earlier spectral type with st@xmath164.5 .",
    "a few galaxies with early - type seds ( @xmath15% have st@xmath161.5 ) are also present in the uv - selected sample .",
    "these early - type objects with star - forming cores could be the result of mergers or star formation triggered by the rapid mass infall into a central black hole as suggested in menanteau et al .",

    "( 2006 ) found that lbgs at @xmath31 are either disks ( 75% ) or mergers ( 22% ) , and only one object ( 3% ) is a spheroid .",
    "in order to assess the nature of the galaxies that are forming stars at intermediate@xmath9 we have visually inspected all 93 objects with starbursts seds and classified them according to their optical morphology and searched their environment ( 5@xmath25 arcsec ) for other objects .",
    "we did the analysis in the goods bands ( b , v , i , and z ) since fuv morphologies can give an erroneous view of the galaxy s shape ( e.g. hibbard & vacca 1997 ) .",
    "we found that ( i ) nearly 75% of the starbursts have tidal tails or show some peculiarity typical of interaction / mergers , ( ii ) @xmath150% have another galaxy within the searched area .",
    "we also found that @xmath136% of the starbursts are characterized by the presence of a large clump and extended tail , known as tadpoles .",
    "very little is known about these objects and their fate during evolution .",
    "the main question is whether such galaxies are rotating edge - on systems or are objects with peculiar morphology from merging or accretion ( elmegreen et al . 2004 , 2005a ) .",
    "we discuss these objects in more detail in  6 .",
    "although our photometric redshifts are well - calibrated with spectroscopic redshifts within the goods collaboration ( @xmath301,000 redshifts for both goods fields ) , the featureless spectra of starbursts , compared to earlier type galaxies with a pronounced 4000 - break , make their photometric redshift estimates uncertain with an increased risk of ` catastrophic redshifts ' with large errors . in order to prevent any bias due to the photometric redshift estimates we were conservative and repeated our analysis for the 95 objects with known spectroscopic redshifts and found ( i ) 35% are starbursts , ( ii ) 66% of the starbursts show some obvious tidal effect and/or presence of another galaxy within the searched area .",

    "( 2004 , 2005a ) , their unusual morphology is not merely a band - shifting effect , since the large clumps have no counterparts in the local universe as seen in the uv nearby galaxy survey ( windhorst et al .",
    "the main question is whether these clumps are accreted clumps that are building up galaxies through hierarchical mergers ( straughn et al .",
