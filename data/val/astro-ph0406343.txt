    "in recent years , precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) , and distant supernovae ( sne ) have increased our knowledge of the large scale properties of the universe tremendously .",
    "the standard @xmath0cdm model of cosmology has turned out to be able to fit all available data with only a few free parameters .",
    "however , there are still many parameters related to cosmology which are not well determined by the present large scale observations . for instance , in order for the cmb data from the wmap experiment ( @xcite ) to provide a stringent limit on the curvature of the universe , a prior on the hubble parameter is necessary .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by adding lss data from surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite or the 2df survey @xcite , but other independent methods for measuring the hubble parameter precisely are of great interest .",
    "another problem is that the nature of the dark matter is at present unknown .",
    "the properties of dark matter on large scales are compatible with a heavy , collisionless species which clusters gravitationally , cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "on the other hand there are significant problems with understanding some properties of galaxies in cdm models .",
    "numerical simulations of galaxy formation in cdm models show that dark matter halos exhibit a universal density profile with a central slope @xmath1 , with @xmath2 ( @xcite ) . at large radii",
    "the profile steepens to @xmath3 .",
    "while the outer slope is consistent with current observations , there are problems with fitting the inner slope of halos .",
    "observations of rotation curves of many dwarf galaxies , indicating almost constant density cores , suggest that the inner density profiles in these systems are much shallower than found in simulations @xcite .",
    "another problem is that the number of subhalos within a milky way - sized halo predicted by the simulations exceed the observed number of satellite galaxies by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "many explanations have been offered for this discrepancy .",
    "one possibility is that tidal interactions between baryons and dark matter erase the central cusps , and that early star formation expels baryons from small subhalos , rendering them invisible . whether this purely astrophysical explanation can work",
    "is not clear at present .",
    "another possibility is that the properties of dark matter are slightly different from pure cdm .",
    "if for instance dark matter has relatively strong self - interactions or is warm instead of cold , shallow density profiles and lack of subhalos might be explained .",
    "however , it should be noted that the simplest models of self - interacting dark matter predict large constant - density cores in clusters of galaxies which are ruled out by x - ray and gravitational lensing observations ( meneghetti et al .",
    "2001 ; arabadjis , bautz , & garmire 2002 ; dahle , hannestad , & sommer - larsen 2003 ) .    at present",
    "the ultra - high resolution simulations of galaxy formation do not include baryons .",
    "this in turn means that for regions of galaxies which are baryon dominated the discrepancy might be resolved by a more complete understanding of feed - back from star formation . in dwarf galaxies",
    "this effect is unlikely to be dominant , but for the high - mass systems typically investigated with the method proposed here , the regions probed will be dominated by the baryonic component .",
    "therefore the density profile which we derive for the inner parts of galaxies is likely to be dominated by baryonic physics and can therefore not be directly related to either the pure n - body simulations or to the observations of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies .",
    "nevertheless it is of great importance to get a precise observational determination of the halo density profiles in order to understand whether the difference between observations and simulations is generic , or specific to some systems .",
    "gravitational lensing has the potential to give information on both the matter distribution in galaxies as well as the hubble parameter .",
    "more than 40 years ago , refsdal outlined how it should be possible to measure the hubble parameter and the mass of a galaxy by measuring the time delay between multiple images of a supernova ( sn ) lying far behind and close to the line of sight through the lensing galaxy @xcite .",
    "the first observation of gravitational lensing in a cosmological context was made in 1979 , when two images of the quasar qso 0957 + 651 at @xmath4 was observed . for several reasons",
    ", it has been difficult to implement refsdal s method on this system . until 1997",
    "it was not possible to precisely determine a time delay for the system , and even then the complexity of the lens system ( a brightest cluster galaxy located close to the center of a galaxy cluster ) has made estimates of the hubble parameter highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "studies of this system have also showed the importance of including effects from substructure in the lens .    to date , approximately 70 multiply imaged sources have been observed out of which there are eleven firm time delay measurements ( @xcite ; + @xcite ) .",
    "there is not yet any agreement on the correct value of the hubble parameter inferred from these measurements due to differences in the modeling of the lensing galaxies . in general , modeling the lenses as more concentrated gives larger values of @xmath5 and vice versa , e.g. , kochanek ( 2002 ) obtains @xmath6 if the lenses have isothermal mass distributions and @xmath7 if they have constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "there are basically two different routes in trying to improve on current results .",
    "one is to try to do extremely careful modeling of single simple lens systems . following this approach , wucknitz , biggs , & browne ( 2004 )",
    "find @xmath8 ( 2 @xmath9 ) based on the lens system b0218 + 357 , consistent with the local estimate @xmath10 ( 1 @xmath9 ) from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project ( mould et al .",
    "2000 ; freedman et al .",
    "another possibility is to combine results from a larger number of , perhaps less well constrained , systems . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the latter method .    in order to avoid any systematic bias due to selection effects , it is important to have a well - defined statistical sample .",
    "the currently largest survey of strong lensing events is the recently completed cosmic lens all - sky survey .",
    "a subsample of 8958 flat - spectrum radio sources of which 13 have multiple images constitutes a well - defined statistical sample and has been used to constrain cosmological parameters as well as galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "future surveys that will improve statistics and also include multiply imaged sne for which time delay measurements can be obtained at high accuracy due to the characteristic light curves include pan - starrs and the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how future snap data of multiply imaged core - collapse sne can be used to measure the slope of galactic halos and the hubble parameter ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this paper extends and generalizes earlier work + @xcite where similar data was used to constrain @xmath5 and @xmath11 using simpler lens models .",
    "a recent work by oguri & kawano ( 2003 ) have considered a similar use of quadruply lensed type ia sne events .",
    "the possiblity of using sne that are multiply lensed by rich galaxy clusters to constrain @xmath5 has been considered by bolton & burles ( 2003 ) .",
    "the complementarity of strong lensing to other probes of the expansion rate is discussed by linder ( 2004 ) .",
    "finally , it should be noted that while the method proposed here is very sensitive to the inner density profile of galaxies , this density profile does not necessarily reflect the nature of pure dark matter halos .",
    "lensing mainly occurs in relatively massive galaxies in which baryonic material is a dominant component at small radii .",
    "this in turn means that there can be a substantial modification of the inner density profile due to cooling and infall ( @xcite ) .    in sec .",

    "for most lensing purposes , galaxy matter distributions can be described by the projected newtonian gravitational potential @xmath12 we assume that lens systems are characterized by a simple power - law density profile @xmath13 this is not a good approximation at all radii since the slope is expected to change with radius . in practice however , almost all images of multiply lensed sne are at a limited range of small @xmath14 ( see fig .  [",
