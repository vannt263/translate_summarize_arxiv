    "transiting planets are especially valuable targets in exoplanet studies due to the fact that both their radius and mass can be determined .",

    "the large number of confirmed transiting exoplanets provide us a unique opportunity to investigate their distribution in parameter space , such as the period - radius ( p - r ) relation , the period - mass ( p - m ) relation , and the mass - radius ( m - r ) relation . while the m - r relation is useful to investigate the composition and existence of volatile - rich atmosphere @xcite , p - r and p - m relations are suggested to provide possible insights into planet formation and the migration of short - period planets .    in this",
    "regard , short - period neptune - sized planets are especially interesting , since such planets occupy a region of parameter space which corresponds to the proposed dearth of short - period super - neptune / sub - jovian planets .",
    "moreover , since transiting exoplanets allow us to investigate their atmospheres via transmission spectroscopy , to measure spin - orbit ( mis)alignments via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect or doppler tomography , and to probe possible presence of outer planets via transit timing variations , they will incubate further follow - up science cases and provide additional clues to uncover formation and migration mechanisms of short - period planets .    in this paper , we report the confirmation of a new transiting hot neptune around a metal - rich g - dwarf epic  211525389 ( tyc 807 - 1019 - 1 ) in _",

    "this target was identified as an interesting candidate planet host by the international collaboration esprint , _ equipo de seguimiento de planetas rocosos intepretando sus transitos _ , @xcite .",
    "although the star was also reported to be a candidate planet host by @xcite and @xcite , we have confirmed the planetary nature of this object for the first time via high dispersion spectroscopy , high - contrast ao imaging , additional ground - based transit photometry , and radial velocity ( rv ) measurements .",

    "observations of _ k2 _ , high dispersion spectroscopy , ao imaging , and additional transit photometry as well as our reduction methods are described in  2.12.4 .",
    "we present stellar parameters of epic  211525389 ( hereafter k2 - 105 ) from high dispersion spectroscopy in  3.1 , a contrast curve around the host star from ao imaging in  3.2 , a joint transit analysis with light curves from _ k2 _ and ground - based multi - color transit photometry in  3.3 , and rvs and a corresponding upper limit on the mass of epic  211525389  b ( hereafter k2 - 105  b ) in  3.4 .",

    "we found small variability in the raw light curve with the amplitude of @xmath18 % and the period of @xmath19 days , possibly related with the stellar rotation .",

    "no odd - even difference was observed in the dimming and no significant evidence of secondary eclipses were seen , suggesting that the signal is likely to be caused by a transiting planet .",
    "we thus added this object as one of our follow - up targets .",

    "we also took hds spectra with the same setup and with the iodine cell to monitor rvs of k2 - 105 on 2015 nov 26 - 28 , 2016 feb 2 , and 2016 oct 12 - 14 ( ut ) .",
    "high contrast , high spatial resolution images of k2 - 105 were taken in the @xmath24 band with hiciao @xcite in combination with ao188 ( 188 element curvature sensor adaptive optics system : @xcite ) on the subaru telescope on 2015 december 30 ( ut ) .",
    "the field of view of hiciao is about @xmath25 .",
    "we used the target itself as a natural guide star for ao188 , producing the typical ao - corrected full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath26 .",
    "all of our observations were carried out in siderial tracking mode .",
    "we acquired 10 object frames with an individual exposure time of 5 s , using a 9.74%-transmittance neutral density ( nd ) filter that avoids saturation of the target star .",
    "those unsaturated frames were used to calibrate the contrast limit around the target .",
    "in addition , we performed the observations without the nd filter and took 60 object frames with 15 s exposure , enabling us to search for the faint sources around the target .",
    "the total exposure time was 15 min ( 50 s ) without ( with ) the nd filter .",
    "the acorns pipeline ( see @xcite ) was used to reduce the hiciao data as follows .",
    "first we remove a characteristic stripe bias pattern @xcite , and then bad pixel and flat - field correction are performed . in order to correct hiciao s field distortion , we compare hiciao data of the m5 globular cluster taken during the same run with the archival m5 images taken by advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hubble space telescope _",

    "on the other hand , the fractional light curve of c1/c2 in @xmath28 band shows a strange systematic variation with the amplitude of @xmath200.4% .",

    "we also find that the peak count and total flux of the target suddenly dropped after jd 2457429.17 , even though the fwhm did not change , suggesting the sky transparency changed significantly at that time .",
