    "networks composed of nodes and edges have been attracting a lot of research interest recently  @xcite . unlike conventional networks such as a periodic regular network and a random network , many real - world networks have complex structure .",
    "many of them belong to the class of so - called scale - free  ( sf ) networks . denoting the degree @xmath2 of a node as the number of edges attached to it , a sf is characterized with the power - law degree distribution @xmath3 here @xmath4",
    "is called the degree distribution exponent .",
    "the power - law degree distribution implies that the sf network has an inhomogeneous structure . on the one hand , it is a challenging problem to characterize and understand the organization principle of the sf network . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also interesting to study thermodynamic or dynamic systems on such an inhomogeneous structure .",
    "various physical problems have been studied .",
    "examples include the ferromagnetic phase transitions in the ising model  @xcite , the non - equilibrium phase transition in the epidemic spreading model  @xcite , the random walk process  @xcite , the dynamic scaling in pair - annihilation process  @xcite , and so on . in those studies ,",
    "the @xmath4-dependent scaling properties have been studied .    in the present work ,",
    "we address the question how the global structure of the underlying sf network influences the dynamic scaling behavior of stochastic particle systems . for that purpose",
    "we study the random walk process and the pair - annihilation process , and investigate their dynamic scaling property .",
    "both systems are studied on the _ tree _ structure sf  ( tsf ) networks and the _ looped _ structure sf  ( lsf ) networks , respectively .    to be specific",
    ", we study the stochastic systems on the dorogovtsev - mendes - samukhin  ( dms ) network  @xcite , which is a generalization of the barabsi - albert  ( ba ) network  @xcite .",
    "it is a _ non - deterministic _ model for a growing network : each time step , a new node is added , and linked with @xmath5 nodes which are selected among existing nodes with the probability given by @xmath6 . here the parameter @xmath7 is called an initial attractiveness .",
    "the ba model corresponds to the @xmath8 case of the dms network .",
    "the resulting network is scale - free and the degree distribution exponent is given by @xmath9 with the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath7 , one can vary the value of the degree exponent . at the same time , one can also generate a tsf network with @xmath10 or a lsf network with @xmath11 .",
    "hence , we can study the effect of the degree distribution exponent and the global network structure systematically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "as a basic and fundamental stochastic process , the random walk process  @xcite on complex networks has been attracting a lot of research interest  @xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on relaxation dynamics on sf networks .    on a network with @xmath1 nodes ,",
    "a random walker is assigned to a starting node denoted by @xmath12 at time @xmath13 .",
    "then , at each unit time step @xmath14 , it hops to one of the neighboring nodes selected randomly with the equal probability . defining @xmath15 as the probability to find the walker at node @xmath16 at time @xmath17",
    ", one finds that it evolves in time as @xmath18 with the initial condition @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the adjacency matrix whose elements are @xmath21 if two nodes @xmath16 and @xmath22 are connected  ( disconnected ) .    the relaxation dynamics is studied with the so - called return probability @xmath23 . for a given network , one can solve numerically the master equation eq .",
    "( [ master_eq ] ) iteratively to obtain @xmath24 .",
    "we then average it over different realizations of the networks .    on a network with loops",
    ", the probability distribution converges to the stationary one @xmath25 in the @xmath26 limit  @xcite .",
    "hence , the return probability converges to @xmath27 . on the other hand , on a tree network ,",
    "the probability distribution is oscillating in time , so is the return probability .",
    "the random walker can not return to a starting node in odd time steps , which means that @xmath28 at odd @xmath17 . in this case , we only measure the return probability at even time steps , which converges to stationary value @xmath29 .    in a sf network ,",
    "the node degree is distributed so broadly that one can define an exponent @xmath30 for each node @xmath12 describing the degree scaling with the network size : @xmath31 for instance , in the dms network with the degree distribution exponent @xmath4 , a _ peripheral node _ with the minimum degree has @xmath32 , while the _ hub _ with the maximum degree has @xmath33 . then , the return probability in the stationary state scales with the network size as @xmath34    ( open symbols ) and @xmath35  ( filled symbols ) in the dms networks with @xmath36 and with @xmath10 in ( a ) and @xmath37 in ( b).,width=264 ]    due to the broad degree distribution , the return probability @xmath24 may have a different scaling property at different starting node @xmath12 with different values of @xmath30 .",
    "so , we measured the return probability @xmath38 for the hub and @xmath39 for a peripheral node on the dms networks .",
    "we present the numerical data for the return probability @xmath40 and @xmath35 in fig .",
    "we compare the data obtained from the tsf networks and the lsf networks .",
    "the data show that the return probability behaves distinctly depending on the global structure of the network , which will be discussed in detail in the following .",
    "we perform the quantitative analysis of the scaling property in the tsf . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one finds that the return probability relaxes much slower in the tsf network with @xmath10 .",

    "the relaxation time is plotted as a function of the network size @xmath1 in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it shows that the relaxation time estimated from @xmath40 and @xmath35 follows a power - law scaling @xmath44 with the same dynamic exponent @xmath45     for @xmath38  ( open symbols ) and @xmath39  ( filled symbols ) on the tree structure sf networks .",

    "let @xmath48 denote the neighbors of the node @xmath16 .",

    ", the tree network would be decomposed into two parts . denoting the number of nodes in the @xmath16 side by @xmath50 , the mfpt is simply given by @xmath51 hence , for a typical adjacent nodes @xmath16 and @xmath22 , one has that @xmath52 . for non - adjacent nodes @xmath16 and @xmath22 ,",
    "the mfpt is given by the sum of the mfpt s given by eq .",
    "( [ t_ji ] ) along the path between them .",
    "hence , the mfpt between a typical node pair is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mean diameter of the networks .",
    "for sf networks , the mean diameter scales at most logarithmically with the network size  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the relaxation time follows the power - law scaling @xmath55 with the dynamic exponent @xmath56 .",
    "the power - law scaling of the relaxation time suggests that the return probability decays algebraically as @xmath57 with the decay exponent @xmath58 . for a node @xmath12 with the degree scaling @xmath59 ,",

    ", width=264 ]    it is interesting to note that the decay exponent varies with the degree scaling exponent @xmath30 of the starting node @xmath12 .",
    "we confirm the scaling behavior with the scaling plot of @xmath69 versus @xmath70 for the hub and the peripheral node in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for @xmath36 , @xmath71 for the hub and @xmath72 for the peripheral node , which yields that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath68 , one expects that @xmath75 and @xmath74 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , one can see that the return probability decays much faster in the lsf networks .",

    "we found that the relaxation time , measured using the condition that @xmath79 , grows at most logarithmically with the network size @xmath1 .",
