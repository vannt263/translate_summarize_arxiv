    "these strong fields become very small beyond @xmath26 in the shocked ambient region  @xcite .    in the case with electron - ion jet , due to the heavier ions at @xmath20 the density",

    "in the front of electron - ion jet the electromagnetic fields disappear as shown in fig",
    "in order to generate a shock it will require at least several time longer simulations .",
    "a synchrotron shock model is widely adopted to describe the radiation mechanism in the external shock thought to be responsible for observed broad - band grb afterglows  @xcite .",
    "associated with this model are three major assumptions that are adopted in almost all current grb afterglow models .",
    "firstly , electrons are assumed to be `` fermi '' accelerated at the relativistic shocks and to have a power - law distribution with a power - law index @xmath27 upon acceleration , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with recent pic simulations of the shock formation and particle acceleration  @xcite and also some monte carlo models  @xcite , but see  @xcite .",
    "secondly , a fraction @xmath29 ( generally taken to be @xmath30 ) of the total electrons associated with ism baryons are accelerated , and the total electron energy is a fraction @xmath29 of the total internal energy in the shocked region .",
    "thirdly , the strength of the magnetic fields in the shocked region is unknown , but its energy density ( @xmath31 ) is assumed to be a fraction @xmath32 of the internal energy .",
    "these assumed `` micro - physics '' parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , whose values are obtained from spectral fits  @xcite reflect a lack of knowledge of the underlying microphysics  @xcite .    the typical observed emission frequency from an electron with ( comoving ) energy @xmath35 in a frame with a bulk lorentz factor",
    "@xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "three critical frequencies are defined by three characteristic electron energies .",
    "these are @xmath38 ( the injection frequency ) , @xmath39 ( the cooling frequency ) , and @xmath40 ( the maximum synchrotron frequency ) . in our simulations of grb afterglows , there is one additional relevant frequency , @xmath41 , due to synchrotron self - absorption at lower frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the general agreement between the blast wave dynamics and the direct measurements of the fireball size argue for the validity of this model s dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the shock is most likely collisionless , i.e. mediated by plasma instabilities  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic instabilities mediating the afterglow shock are expected to generate magnetic fields .",
    "afterglow radiation was therefore predicted to result from synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons  @xcite .",
    "the observed spectrum of afterglow radiation is indeed remarkably consistent with synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated to a power - law distribution , providing support for the standard afterglow model based on synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons  @xcite . in order to determine the luminosity and spectrum of synchrotron radiation ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field ( @xmath34 ) and the energy distribution of the electrons ( @xmath27 ) must be determined . due to the lack of a first principles theory of collisionless shocks , a purely phenomenological approach to the model of afterglow radiation",
    "was ascribed without investigating in detail the processes responsible for particle acceleration and magnetic field generation  @xcite .",
    "rather , one simply assumes that a fraction @xmath34 of the post - shock thermal energy density is carried by the magnetic field , that a fraction @xmath29 is carried by electrons , and that the energy distribution of the electrons is a power - law , @xmath42 ( above some minimum energy @xmath43 which is determined by @xmath29 and @xmath27 ) , @xmath44 , @xmath29 and @xmath27 are treated as free parameters , determined by observations .",
    "it is important to clarify here that the constraints implied on these parameters by the observations are independent of any assumptions regarding the nature of the afterglow shock and the processes responsible for particle acceleration or magnetic field generation .",
    "any model should satisfy these observational constraints .",
    "the properties of synchrotron ( or  jitter \" ) emission from relativistic shocks will be determined by the magnetic field strength and structure and the electron energy distribution behind the shock .",
    "the characteristics of jitter radiation may be important to understanding the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure in gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "for example , jitter radiation has been proposed as a means to explain grb spectra below the peak frequency that are harder than the `` line of death '' spectral index associated with synchrotron emission  @xcite , i.e. , the observed spectral power scales as @xmath45 , whereas synchrotron spectra are @xmath46 or softer  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is essential to calculate radiation production by tracing electrons ( positrons ) in self - consistently treated small - scale electromagnetic fields .",
    "let a particle be at position @xmath47 at time @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , we observe the electric field from the particle from position @xmath49 . however , because of the finite velocity of light , we observe the particle at an earlier position @xmath50 where it was at the retarded time @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath52 is the distance from the charge ( at the retarded time @xmath53 ) to the observer .",
    "after some calculation and simplifying assumptions the total energy @xmath54 radiated per unit solid angle per unit frequency from a charged particle moving with instantaneous velocity @xmath55 under acceleration @xmath56 can be expressed as  @xcite    @xmath57}{(1-\\bf{\\beta}\\cdot \\bf{n})^{2 } }    e^{i\\omega(t^ { ' } -\\bf{n } \\cdot \\bf{r}_{0}(t^{'})/c ) } dt^{'}\\right|^{2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath58 is a unit vector that points from the particle s retarded position towards the observer .",
