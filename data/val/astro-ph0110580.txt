    "the study of the statistics of the fluctuating gravitional force in infinite homogeneous systems was pionered by chandrasekhar & von neumann in two classical papers ( chandrasekhar & von neumann 1942 , 1943 hereafter cn43 ) .",
    "the analysis of the fluctuating gravitional field , developed by the quoted authors , was formulated by means of a statistical treatment in the case of uniform systems , and with no correlations .",
    "two distributions are fundamental for the description of the fluctuating gravitional field :    * \\1 ) @xmath1 which gives the probability that a test star is subject to a force @xmath2 in the range @xmath2 , @xmath2 + d@xmath2 ; * \\2 ) @xmath3 which gives the joint probability that the star experiences a force * f * and a rate of change * f * , where @xmath4 .    from a pure theorethical ground we expect that inhomogeneity affects all the aspects of the fluctuating gravitational field ( antonuccio & colafrancesco 1994 ; del popolo 1996a , b ; del popolo & gambera 1998 ) .      assuming that the system density is described by a powe law of index @xmath6 , the expression of @xmath3 is given following markoff s method by ( cn43 ) : @xmath7 } \\right\\ } d{\\bf k } d{\\bf \\sigma } \\label{eq : set}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a lenghty calculation leads us ( see del popolo & gambera 1998 for a derivation and the meaning of simbols ) to find the function @xmath8 : @xmath9 \\cdot   [ q({\\bf \\sigma } ) + k r({\\bf \\sigma } ) ] \\ }   \\label{eq : trense}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this last equation introduced into eq .",
    "( [ eq : set ] ) solves the problem of finding the distribution @xmath10 and makes it possible to find the moments of @xmath11 that give information regarding the dynamical friction . using this last expression for @xmath8 and performing a calculation similar to that by cn43 the first moment of @xmath12",
    "is given by : @xmath13 \\label{eq : quaruno}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 \\left [ \\frac { \\sin{x}}{x^{(2 - p)/2 } } - \\frac{\\cos{x}}{x^{p/2 } } \\right ] dx \\nonumber \\\\             &    & - \\ ; 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty }             \\left [ e^{(x/\\beta)^{\\frac{(3 - p)}{2 } } }             \\right ] \\cdot \\frac{\\sin{x}}{x^{(p - 2)/2 } } dx \\label{eq : quardu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq : quaruno ] ) , in a inhomogeneous system , differently from homogeneous ones , @xmath12 is a function of the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath6 .    at this point",
    "we may show how dynamical friction changes due to inhomogeneity . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : quaruno ] ) we see that @xmath15 differs from that obtained in homogeneus system only for the presence of a dependence on the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath16 .",
    "if we divide eq .",
    "( [ eq : quaruno ] ) for the correspondent of cn43 we obtain : @xmath17 this last equation is an increasing function of @xmath6 .",
    "this means that for increasing values of @xmath16 the star suffers an even greater amount of acceleration in the direction @xmath18 ( when @xmath19 ) than in the direction @xmath20 ( when @xmath21 ) , with respect to the homogeneous case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the difference between the amplitude of the decelerating impulses and the accelerating ones is , as in homogeneous systems , statistically negative , but now larger , being the scale factor greater .",
    "this finally means that , for a given value of @xmath22 , the dynamical friction increases with increasing inhomogeneity in the space distribution of stars .",
    "in addition , by increasing @xmath22 the dynamical friction increases , just like in the homogeneous systems , but the increase is larger than the linear increase observed in homegeneous ones .    antonuccio - delogu v. , colafrancesco s. , 1994 , apj 427 , 72 chandrasekhar s. , von neumann j. , 1942 , apj 95 , 489 chandrasekhar s. , von neumann j. , 1943 , apj 97 , 1 ( cn43 ) del popolo a. , 1996a , a&a 305 , 999 del popolo a. , 1996b , a&a 311 , 715 del popolo a. , gambera m. , 1998 , a&a , 342 , 34"
