    "markov processes have been intensively used to describe variability features of various cellular processes . to our best knowledge , markovian tools",
    "have first been employed in connection to molecular biology in @xcite .",
    "the natural idea was to associate to each reaction network a pure jump model . due to the large number of molecular species",
    "involved in the reactions , direct simulation of these models turns out to be very slow . to increase proficiency ,",
    "hybrid models are adopted in @xcite .",
    "they distinguish the discrete components from the `` continuous '' ones .",
    "using partial kramers - moyal expansion , the authors of @xcite replace the initial pure jump process with an appropriate piecewise deterministic markov one .",
    "one may reduce the complexity of pdmps by restricting the model to some invariant set containing the initial data , whenever this is known .",
    "compact invariant sets are also needed for efficiently implementing algorithms .",
    "another important issue that can be approached using invariance are the stable points .",
    "in particular , a fixed point for which one finds arbitrarily small surrounding invariant sets is stable in the sense of lyapunov .",
    "we begin by characterizing @xmath1-viability of controlled pdmps via some associated control problem .",
    "a closed set of constraints @xmath2 is said to be viable ( or @xmath1-viable ) with respect to some dynamic control system if , starting from @xmath3 one is able to find suitable controls keeping the trajectory in @xmath2 ( or , at least in some arbitrarily small neighborhood of the set of constraints ) .",
    "viability properties have been extensively studied in both deterministic and stochastic settings ( for brownian diffusions ) , starting from the pioneer work of nagumo .",
    "the methods used to describe this property for deterministic or diffusion processes rely either on the bouligand - severi contingent cone ( cf .",

    "using analytical tools from viscosity theory , we provide a geometrical characterization of @xmath1-viability and invariance of some set of constraints @xmath2 with respect to the controlled piecewise deterministic markov process . as for the brownian diffusion case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the criterion involves the normal cone to the set of constraints and is completely deterministic .",
    "similar arguments allow one to characterize the invariance of the set of constraints .",
    "we emphasize that these geometrical conditions can be rather easily checked for pdmps associated to gene networks . in order to illustrate these theoretical assertions , two examples are considered . for general on / off models , we show how the invariance criterion can be used in order to reduce the state space to a compact set .",
    "we also characterize points that can be chosen as candidates for stability ( in the sense that one finds arbitrarily small surrounding regions that are invariant ) .",
    "another biological example is a model for bacteriophage @xmath0 ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "although it is more complex , one can still use the invariance criterion to characterize candidates for stability .",
    "it turns out that only one such point exists in the absence of impulsive exterior control factors .",
    "the second aim of the paper is to characterize the reachability property of arbitrary open sets with respect to the controlled piecewise deterministic markov process .",
    "the criterion is obtained using viscosity methods .",
    "recently , the paper @xcite has provided a linear programming formulation for discounted control problems in the framework of sdes driven by standard brownian motion .",
    "the reachability problem can be connected to the value function of some appropriate piecewise deterministic control system .",
    "using the idea in @xcite , we give a criterion involving the dual formulation of the linearized version of the initial problem . to illustrate this result , we consider",

    "our criterion allows one to prove that , starting from any arbitrary point , one reaches any arbitrarily given open region , with positive probability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in subsection [ constr+ass ] we briefly recall the construction of controlled pdmps and state the main ( standard ) assumptions . section [ section1 ] is devoted to the study of viability property ( subsection [ subsection1.1 ] ) and invariance ( subsection [ subsection1.2 ] ) with respect to the pdmp .",
    "the criteria involve the normal cone to the set of constraints and the characteristics of the process .",
    "section [ section2 ] deals with the reachability property .",
    "we use a krylov - type argument to provide some dual formulation of the associated control problem . in subsection [ subsection3.1 ]",
