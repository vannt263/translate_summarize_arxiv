    "note that the subsequent growth of @xmath59 is slightly less pronounced for @xmath66 than for @xmath67 .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that in this particular interval of channel widths a single nodal line along the center of the channel is still most often encountered , while the theorical model developed in the next section would in principle allow also for the excitation of the subsequent mode exhibiting three nodal lines .",

    "the above observations can be qualitatively captured by means of an approximate theory of the faraday waves that are emitted by the bouncing droplets . in a confinement - free configuration , a single bounce of a droplet at the position @xmath73 gives rise to a periodically oscillating surface wave profile of the form @xcite @xmath74 which decays with a rate @xmath75 that is inversely proportional to @xmath43 .",

    "( [ eq : freesurf ] ) will be modified in the presence of sub - surface channels .",
    "we suggest that this modification can be approximately accounted for by introducing additional boundary conditions to the helmholtz equation , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) , that the green function has to satisfy . inspecting the experimentally obtained surface wave profiles that are depicted in the lower panels of fig .",
    "3 , we infer that the faraday waves emitted by a droplet in a channel approximately satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions at the lateral borders of the channel , yielding the condition @xmath84 at @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the green function of the helmholtz equation .",
    "we define the horizontal coordinate system such that the channel lies within @xmath88 .",
    "they furthermore appear to exhibit a nodal line at the channel s centre at @xmath89 as can be seen again in fig .",
    "3 , which is presumably required to allow for a stable droplet motion within the channel . we can then expand the green function within the lateral channel eigenmodes @xmath90 satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions and @xmath91 with @xmath92 , and exhibiting a node at @xmath89 .",
    "this then yields a superposition of longitudinal waves of the form @xmath93 with @xmath94 for @xmath95 , complemented by another superposition of evanescent waves of the form @xmath96 with @xmath97 for @xmath98 the influence of which can be safely neglected . as a consequence",
    ", surface waves can not be sustainably excited within too narrow channels whose widths @xmath99 are below the faraday wavelength .",
    "this in turn inhibits the walking of droplets within such narrow channels , which is in excellent agreement with our experimental findings .",
    "it is now straightforward to infer that the walking speed @xmath100 of the droplet within the channel is proportional to the effective wave number that characterizes the longitudinal faraday wave pattern along the channel , as this particular wave number determines the slope of the surface wave profile through which the droplet is horizontally accelerated upon impact . in the particular case of channels",
    "whose widths satisfy @xmath101 , this effective wave number is evidently given by @xmath102 as only the lowest channel mode @xmath103 can be excited in that case .",
    "this yields the longitudinal walking speed @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a characteristic speed scale of the droplet without constraints , i.e. the speed of a drop in 2d .",
    "equation ( [ eq : wg ] ) is fitted on the data of fig .",
    "[ speeds](a ) , yielding as sole free parameter @xmath106mm / s , which roughly corresponds to the speed for droplets in 2d .",
    "the fit is in good agreement with our experiments , even for @xmath107 .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that longitudinal speed of the droplet is predominatly governed by the largest variation of the faraday wave along the channel , and the latter would be provided by the lowest transverse mode @xmath103 .",
    "the transverse speed @xmath108 , on the other hand , should be determined by the highest transverse mode that enters into the superposition of modes constituting the faraday wave profile , since this particular mode provides the largest wave profile variations across the channel .",
    "we therefore should generally expect @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the largest integer that satisfies @xmath111 .",
    "this expectation is roughly satisfied as we can see in fig .",
    "there are , however , significant deviations due to the fact that in practice this highest transverse mode @xmath112 hardly ever participates in the experimentally observed faraday wave profile , as we saw in fig .",
    "3 . a more elaborate theoretical framework , taking into account the decay of faraday waves outside the channel in a more quantitative manner , is certainly needed in order refine the model under consideration and thereby obtain a more detailed understanding of the behaviour of walking droplets in channels .",
    "the properties of the walkers dynamics reminds the propagation of light in rectangular electromagnetic wave - guides .",
    "in particular , one may notice the `` ray - optics approach '' used to understand the wave propagation in a guide , where the rays of light bounces on each wall .",
    "let us compare both systems : wave - guides are usually made of two materials with refraction index @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the light propagates in the medium of index @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the light is focussed in the guide thanks to total reflection . in the walking droplet experiments ,",
    "the two `` materials '' are the regions of different fluid depths which alter the propagation of the faraday waves , as seen in fig .",
    "[ traject ] .",
    "the walker is constrained within the channel thanks to the differences between the faraday thresholds .",
    "more interestingly , the analogy can be pushed further by comparing the velocity of the walker to the group velocity of the light propagating within an electromagnetic guide .",
    "one can compare here the velocity of the walker to the group velocity of the light propagating within an electromagnetic guide .",
    "indeed for te1 wave guides , the light group velocity is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wg ] ) . nevertheless , some differences occurs .",
    "indeed , the faraday instability auto - adapts to the channel width where , in the electromagnetic case , the wavelength is an experimental fixed parameter .",
    "therefore , the comparison breaks down for large channels which should be compared to te@xmath116 wave guides . furthermore",
    ", this waveguide analogy does not give any explanation for the evolution of @xmath117 with the width of the channel .",
    "finally , the wave emitted by the droplet are standing waves while electromagnetic wave - guides consider only propagating waves .",
    "analogies should therefore be taken with caution .",
    "in summary , we evidenced that it is possible to confine and transport walking droplets along 1d channels . while the longitudinal motion is dominated by a single mode , a fine structure composed of @xmath69 modes",
    "is observed in the transverse direction .",
    "we discussed the similarities and differences with waveguided systems .",
    "we have shown , thanks to an energetic study , that the optimal width maximizing the longitudinal speed is around @xmath118 such that applications can be designed .",
    "in particular , annular cavities have been investigated where droplets share a common coherent wave that propels the group at a velocity faster than a single drop @xcite .",
    "in addition , upon shedding light on the following question : how straight the walker s motion can be in a 1d channel , this study completes the works based on walkers in confined geometries . among them",
    ", one can note the numerical study of gilet @xcite and the experimental work of harris _ et al . _",
