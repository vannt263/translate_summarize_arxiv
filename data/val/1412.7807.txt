    "a great deal of what is known about the dynamics of photosynthetic energy transfer in higher plants and marine algae is based on the information obtained from ultrafast spectroscopic experiments on light - harvesting complexes ( lhcs ) @xcite .",
    "these experiments use femtosecond laser pulses to generate molecular excitations , which then migrate within the complex network of chromophores composing the lhcs and transfer their excitation energy to the reaction center where charge separation and subsequent steps of photosynthesis occur @xcite .",
    "recent experimental observations of long - lasting wavelike energy transfer in lhcs @xcite has triggered a wave of experimental and theoretical research into the possible role of quantum coherences in photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "in contrast to femtosecond laser light used in the laboratory , natural photosynthesis uses incoherent light to excite the system .",
    "incoherent light lacks the temporal and spatial coherence of a femtosecond laser pulse , and is incident on the lhcs on a much longer timescale . as a result , the nature of molecular states prepared by incoherent excitation can be very different from those prepared by femtosecond laser excitation @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown theoretically that incoherent light illumination produces _ incoherent mixtures of individual molecular eigenstates _ rather than their coherent superpositions .    notwithstanding the conclusions of refs .",
    ", an entirely different kind of quantum coherence among the excited states is known to arise @xcite , and persist for a long time @xcite under incoherent light illumination .",
    "these coherences are due to the agarwal - fano ( af ) interference between different incoherent light - induced transition pathways @xcite , and have much in common with previously explored quantum optical phenomena such as vacuum - induced coherence , lasing without inversion , electromagnetically induced transparency , and quantum control @xcite . this kind of noise - induced coherence has recently attracted much interest in view of its potential to enhance the efficiency of quantum heat engines , both natural and artificially designed @xcite .    despite their obvious relevance to photosynthetic light harvesting and photovoltaics , conditions for the generation and preservation of the agarwal - fano ( af )",
    "noise - induced coherences in multilevel quantum systems remain unexplored . to our knowledge",
    "there have been no theoretical studies of these coherences in systems with more than a few excited levels . even for the model three and four - level systems ,",
    "previous theoretical work has been largely limited to the steady - state analysis with invoked drastic approximations , such as the degeneracy of the excited levels @xcite .",
    "a notable exception is the work of hegerfeldt and plenio @xcite , which however focused on the properties of light emitted by the three - level system , rather than the system itself .",
    "we have recently shown @xcite that incoherent light can induce long - lived excited state coherences in a model v - type system provided that the excited state level splitting is smaller than their radiative linewidths , and the dipole moments for the radiative transitions are parallel . however , real molecular systems are comprised of hundreds and thousands of excited vibronic levels , making it necessary to accurately simulate the dynamics of multilevel quantum systems excited by weak incoherent radiation .",
    "the bloch - redfield ( br ) master equation formalism @xcite provides a general framework for such simulations .",
    "these equations describe both the incoherent pumping and spontaneous decay of quantum systems with arbitrary level structure .",
    "the only approximation involved is the born - markov approximation , requiring that the coupling to radiation is weak , and that the memory time of the radiation is infinitely short .",
    "as is well known @xcite , this approximation is well justified for atomic and molecular systems pumped by weak incoherent radiation .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite explored the performance of br equations against more sophisticated ( and realistic ) theoretical methods based on the hierarchy equations of motion @xcite and found that br theory provides an accurate description of weak - field incoherent excitation of a chromophoric dimer in all parameter ranges @xcite .",
    "when properly applied , the br theory can be a powerful theoretical tool for simulating excited state dynamics in molecular aggregates coupled to a surrounding protein environment , even beyond the weak - coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the br equations have been applied to study the dynamics of incoherent excitation of few - level atomic systems in quantum optics @xcite . in these studies",
    "this approach is typically derived `` from scratch '' in operator form , which is advantageous for exploring the mathematical properties and physical meaning of the terms in the master equation @xcite .",
    "here we take an alternative approach , starting from the br equations in the energy basis @xcite , and apply a partial secular approximation that allows us to simplify the equations .",
    "the resultant modified br equations have a clear physical meaning and are parametrized by experimentally observable quantities such as the spontaneous decay and incoherent pumping rates , and show that the alignment parameters between different transition dipole moments play a significant role .",
    "they allow for a clear and unambiguous distinction between the effects of quantum coherent vs. incoherent energy transfer under incoherent light illumination .",
    "specifically , the incoherent regime is characterized by orthogonal transition dipole moments in the energy basis . in this regime ,",
    "the time evolution of the system s reduced density matrix is shown below to be governed by the standard pauli - type rate equations , and a fully incoherent mixture of energy eigenstates is immediately formed , whose character ( _ e.g. _ localization properties ) determines the photoreaction efficiency or quantum yield @xcite . in the opposite regime of non - orthogonal transition dipoles , we observe nontrivial dynamical effects due to the agarwal - fano interference @xcite , prior to long time relaxation to energy eigenstates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the derivation of the br equations and applies the partial secular approximation to arrive at a modified system of equations .",
    "the equations are then specialized to the case of a single - ground state and multiple excited - state systems in sec . iiib .",

    "( [ coh_smalldelta ] ) for @xmath172 and 10 .",
    "we observe that the two - level expression accurately captures the overall effect of the multilevel af coherence .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ coh_smalldelta ] ) predicts a later onset ( and early decline ) of the quasisteady behavior compared to exact calculations , thereby underestimating the coherence lifetime in real multilevel systems .",
    "in addition , the analytical expression does not reproduce the late - time oscillations present in the exact results shown in fig .",
    "nevertheless , the simple model ( [ coh_smalldelta ] ) provides a good estimate of the magnitude of the multilevel coherences and puts a lower bound on their lifetime in the @xmath150 regime .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the time evolution of the various off - diagonal elements of the density matrix in the small @xmath151 regime for @xmath123 .",
    "in contrast with the large-@xmath120 limit for two levels , the duration of the coherences does not decrease with increasing @xmath130 , but rather is in accord with eq .",
    "( [ coh_smalldelta ] ) .",
    "we attribute this remarkable and unexpected longevity of multistage coherences to the constructive af interference between three or more excited states , which can not be properly captured by a two - level model .    as discussed below , the long - lived quantum coherences shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) are closely related to deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium displayed by the populations .",
    "we will thus refer to both of these behaviors as due to _ non - equilibrium quasisteady states _",
    "( neqss ) . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the coherences associated with the neqss form for any value of @xmath142 and persist for the same amount of time @xmath169 .",
    "consider now the time evolution of excited - state populations .",
    "figure  3(b ) compares , as an example , the diagonal matrix elements @xmath173 for @xmath157 evaluated for parallel ( @xmath136 , full lines ) and orthogonal ( @xmath137 , dashed lines ) transition dipole moments . figure  5 shows similar data , but for the sum of excited - state populations vs. time for different numbers of excited states @xmath143 , _",
    "i.e. _ the total population excited from the ground state . as in the @xmath174 case@xcite ,",
    "the excited - state populations are determined by two independent timescales , one of which [ @xmath175 can be much longer than the other [ @xmath163 ] . unlike the coherences , however , the populations in the _ very long - time limit _ , @xmath177 tend to their true equilibrium values set by the boltzmann distribution , @xmath178 .",
    "this long - time limit is the same as that reached in the process of incoherent excitation of the many - level system with orthogonal transition dipole moments ( @xmath137 ) . as illustrated in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 5 , the coherence - free evolution associated with @xmath179 , shown by the dashed lines , results in the same steady - state values of populations .",
    "an important difference is however , the time that it takes for the system to reach equilibrium ; this time is much longer for the system that exhibits the agarwal - fano interference .    in both fig .",
    "3(b ) and 5 , in the absence of agarwal - fano interference , the population is seen to grow steadily at short times before reaching a steady state .",
    "the steady state value of the sum scales linearly with @xmath143 as expected .",
    "the af coherence has a profound effect on the time evolution of the population sum : as shown in fig .",
    "4 , a quasisteady state value is reached between 100 and @xmath180 ps that does not depend on the number of excited states .",
    "this is due to the population @xmath181 coherence transfer occurring on this intermediate timescale , during which the excited - state coherences increase with time ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "at @xmath182 , the curves for different @xmath143 start to diverge , tending to their boltzmann steady state limits .",
    "this signals the beginning of coherence @xmath181 population backtransfer , which enhances the value of the population sum for larger @xmath143 .",
    "this paper provides a theoretical framework for describing incoherent excitation of multilevel quantum systems by weak solar radiation , the central result being a modified system of br equations describing the time evolution of the system reduced density matrix .",
    "the spectrum of the solar radiation is close to that of a black body at 5800 k , with maximum intensity at transition energies @xmath183 1.2 - 2 ev .",
    "since the states within the ground and excited - state manifolds are not directly coupled by the incoherent radiation , we can apply the secular approximation to the inter - manifold transitions while retaining the essential coherences between the states within the same manifold . invoking this approximation",
    "gives a simplified system of br equations for the dynamics of populations and coherences under incoherent illumination .",
    "these equations are parametrized by the incoherent pumping and decay rates , as well as by the angles between the @xmath53 and @xmath59 transition dipole moments @xmath184 .",
    "they can be solved by a simple and efficient @xmath98 algorithm based on the modified br equations without the need to perform numerous matrix products ( as required in standard redfield approaches @xcite ) , and may thus enable accurate numerical simulations of incoherent excitation of quantum multilevel systems involving hundreds to thousands of excited states .    in the limit of orthogonal transition dipole moments , @xmath185 ,",
    "the simplified br equations reduce to rate equations for incoherent population transfer among system eigenstates . in this limit",
    ", the time evolution of the excited - state populations is decoupled from that of the coherences and coherences are not generated by incoherent pumping from the ground state .",
    "we thus arrive at the conclusion reached in refs . and ref .",
    "the present work shows that this conclusion , i.e. , the absence of coherences , _ is valid at all times _ if the transition dipole moments are orthogonal to one another . in the presence of",
    "non - orthogonal transition dipole moments , however , agarwal - fano coherences are initially generated , and can last for long times . eventually , at longer times , these coherences cease to play a role and a boltzmann steady state results , in agreement with a previous theoretical result @xcite .",
    "the timescale for the existence and role of these coherences in real biological systems ( which are also subject to relaxation and decoherence due to the interaction with a protein / solvent / phonon environment ) remains unexplored .",
    "the key condition for the generation of agarwal - fano coherences in that of non - orthogonality of transition dipole moments : @xmath186 , which give rise to couplings between the populations and coherences . in sec .",
    "iv we studied the noise - induced coherence dynamics in both small and large - molecule limits . in the small - molecule limit characterized by @xmath121 , the coherences show damped oscillations and decay to zero at times long compared to the radiative lifetime @xmath163 .    in the large - molecule regime of small level splittings ( @xmath156 ) extremely long - lived coherences are observed along with the formation of non - equlibrium quasi steady states .",
    "these states survive on a timescale that scales as @xmath187 provided that the eigenstates are close enough in energy .",
    "an analytical model recently developed for the v - type system @xcite is found to apply to the multilevel case as well . with certain modifications ,",
    "this model provides a nearly quantitative description of noise - induced coherences and population dynamics in the relevant regimes .",
    "finally , calculations show that agarwal - fano interferences slow down the approach to equilibrium in multilevel systems with non - orthogonal transition dipole moments .",
    "this slow approach is correlated with the presence of near equilibrium steady states characterized by finite values of the coherences [ see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] .",
    "we envision several extensions of this work .",
    "first and foremost , it is important to quantify the role of noise - induced coherences in real molecules , where several considerations are expected to be relevant : ( 1 ) intramolecular vibrational relaxation due to the presence of dark states other than the ground state , leading to secondary decay channels , ( 2 ) dipole and symmetry selection rules leading to many possible orientations of transition dipole moments , ( 3 ) the presence of incoherent transitions from multiple ground states , ( 4 ) anharmonic excited - state level spacings and ( 5 ) possible lamb shift effects at very small @xmath120@xcite .",
    "a first - principles simulation of dynamics of this type could be performed using the approach developed here ( eq .  [ rhoex2 ] ) , where the equations would be parametrized by _ ab initio _ rovibrational energy levels and transition dipole moments .",
    "such a dynamics calculation currently appears feasible for diatomic and modest - size polyatomic molecules , such as hcn or acetylene , which could serve as prototypes for noise - induced coherences in larger systems .",
    "second , for large molecules where direct eigenstate computations are not feasible , it would be necessary to develop adequate theoretical models to take into account the relaxation and decoherence of excited states induced by a phonon bath . as alluded to in sec .",
    "iva this task is complicated by the presence of many internal degrees of freedom and proteomic environments ( such as that in _ cis - trans _ photoisomerization in retinal @xcite ) which are likely to result to rapid relaxation and decoherence of excited state coherences .",
    "however , model calculations show that these coherences can still play a non - negligible role in the energy transfer among certain eigenstates at short times , being comparable in magnitude to the populations @xcite .",
    "theoretical work aiming to explore these effects is currently in progress .    as mentioned above ,",
    "an important question that remains to be addressed is whether the multilevel agarwal - fano coherences considered in this work play a significant role in photosynthetic energy transfer .",
    "the mechanisms such as noise - assisted energy transfer and/or supertransfer , were proposed for the case of coherent excitation initially localized on a single chromophore @xcite . under natural light illumination ,",
    "the entire assembly of chromophores is excited and these mechanisms may no longer apply @xcite , so it is important to study the energy transfer dynamics in the light - harvesting complexes such as fmo and pc645 under incoherent illumination .",
    "such studies are currently in progress @xcite .",
