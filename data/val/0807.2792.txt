    "stationary or static axially symmetric exact solutions of einstein equations describing relativistic thin disks are of great astrophysical importance since can be used as models of certain stars , galaxies and accretion disks .",
    "these were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , obtaining pressureless static disks , and then by morgan and morgan , obtaining static disks with and without radial pressure @xcite . in connection with gravitational collapse",
    ", disks were first studied by chamorro , gregory and stewart @xcite .",
    "disks with radial tension have been also studied @xcite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static and stationary thin disks have been obtained by different authors @xcite , with or without radial pressure .    in the case of static disks without radial pressure , there are two common interpretations .",
    "the stability of these models can be explained by either assuming the existence of hoop stresses or that the particles on the disk plane move under the action of their own gravitational field in such a way that as many particles move clockwise as counterclockwise .",
    "this last interpretation , the `` counterrotating model '' ( crm ) , is frequently made since it can be invoked to mimic true rotational effects . even though this interpretation can be seen as a device",
    ", there are observational evidence of disks made of streams of rotating and counterrotating matter @xcite .",
    "disk sources for stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with magnetic fields are also of astrophysical importance mainly in the study of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation .",
    "although disks with electric fields do not have clear astrophysical importance , their study may be of interes in the context of exact solutions .",
    "thin disk have been discussed as sources for kerr - newman fields @xcite , magnetostatic axisymmetric fields @xcite and conformastationary metrics @xcite . following the ref .",
    "@xcite the resultating disks can be interpreted either as rings with internal pressure and currents or as two counterrotating streams of freely moving charged particles , i.e. which move along electro - geodesics ( solution to the geodesic equation in the presence of a lorentz force ) .    in all the above cases ,",
    "the disks are obtained by an `` inverse problem '' approach , called by synge the `` _ g - method _ '' @xcite .",
    "the method works as follows : a solution of the vacuum einstein equations is taken , such that there is a discontinuity in the derivatives of the metric tensor on the plane of the disk , and the energy - momentum tensor is obtained from the einstein equations .",
    "the physical properties of the matter distribution are then studied by an analysis of the surface energy - momentum tensor so obtained .",
    "on the other hand , a `` direct problem '' approach , called by synge the `` _ t - method _ '' , is also used by other authors @xcite by taking a given surface energy - momentum tensor and solving the einstein equations in the matter region .",
    "the inner solution is then used to obtain boundary data for the vacuum field equations in the outer region .",
    "the t - method is used in ref .",

    "@xcite to generate counterrotating dust disks , but no condition is imposed there about the ( electro- ) geodesic motion of the two counterrotating streams .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a detailed study of the crm for generic electrovacuum static axially symmetric relativistic thin disks without radial pressure . the counterrotating model for the case of static thin disks without electric or magnetic fields",
    "was recently studied in @xcite , so the material presented here is a continuation of the mentioned work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present a summary of the procedure to obtain thin disks models with a purely azimuthal pressure and currents , using the well - known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method extended to solutions of einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "in particular , we obtain expressions for the surface energy - momentum tensor and the current density of the disks .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iii , the disks are interpreted in terms of the crm .",
    "we find a general constraint over the counterrotating tangential velocities needed to cast the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk as the superposition of two counterrotating charged dust fluids .",
    "we also find explicit expressions for the energy densities , current densities and velocities of the counterrotating fluids .",
    "we then show that this constraint can be satisfied if we take the two counterrotating streams as circulating along electro - geodesics .",
    "however , we show that , in general , it is not possible to take the two counterrotating fluids as circulating along electro - geodesics nor take the two counterrotating tangential velocities as equal and opposite .    in the following section , sec .",
    "iv , four simple families of models of counterrotating charged disks based on chazy - curzon - like , zipoy - voorhees - like , bonnor - sackfield - like and kerr - like metrics are presented where we obtain some disks with a crm well behaved .",
    "in particular , we study the tangential velocities , mass and electric charge densities of both streams in the pure static and electrostatic ( magnetostatic ) cases .",
    "also the stability against radial perturbation is analyzed . finally , in sec .",

    "in order to do the decomposition ( [ eq : emtsum ] ) and ( [ eq : corsum ] ) we project the velocity vectors onto the tetrad @xmath38 , using the relations @xcite @xmath39 with the tetrad ( [ eq : tetrad ] ) we can write @xmath40 and thus    @xmath41    [ eq : vawa ]    where @xmath42 are the tangential velocities of the fluids with respect to the tetrad .    using ( [ eq : vawa ] ) , we can write the semt as @xmath43^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ( u_+^a u_-^b + u_-^a u_+^b ) } { ( { \\rm u}_+ - { \\rm u}_-)^2 } ,    \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44    clearly , in order to cast the semt in the form ( [ eq : emtsum ] ) , the mixed term must be absent and therefore the counterrotating tangential velocities must be related by @xmath45 where we assume that @xmath46 . then , assuming a given choice for the counterrotating velocities in agreement with the above relation , we can write the semt as ( [ eq : emtsum ] ) with @xmath47 so that we have two counterrotating dust fluids with energy densities given by @xmath48 { \\rm u}_\\mp \\epsilon . \\label{eq : enercon}\\ ] ] thus the semt @xmath34 can be written as the superposition of two counterrotating dust streams if , and only if , the constraint ( [ eq : liga ] ) admits a solution such that @xmath49 .",

    ".    note that in general the two fluids circulate with different velocities .",
    "however , when the spacetime is electrostatic ( or magnetostatic ) the two electro - geodesic fluids circulate with equal and opposite velocities , so that the constraint ( [ eq : liga ] ) is equivalent to @xmath64 as is commonly assumed in the works concerning counterrotating disks .",
