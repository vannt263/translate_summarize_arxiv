    "coordination of multi - agent networks has attracted a significant amount of attention in the past few years , due to its broad applications in various fields of science including physics , engineering , biology , ecology and social science @xcite . distributed control using neighboring information flow has been shown to ensure collective tasks such as formation , flocking , rendezvous , and aggregation @xcite .",
    "central to multi - agent coordination study is the study of consensus , or state agreement , which requires that all agents achieve the desired relative position and the same velocity .",
    "consensus seeking is extensively studied in the literature for both continuous - time and discrete - time models @xcite .",
    "recently also asynchronous event - triggered sampling for such consensus - seeking multi - agent system was studied @xcite .",
    "researchers are not only concerned with what connectivity conditions can guarantee consensus , but also with the convergence rate : how fast the network reaches a consensus under certain connectivity assumptions @xcite .",
    "consensus algorithms are usually carried out over an underlying communication network .",
    "thus , connectivity of this communication graph plays a key role in consensus analysis .",
    "various connectivity conditions have been used to describe frequently switching topologies in different cases .",
    "the  joint connection \" , i.e. , the union of graphs over a time interval , and similar concepts are important in the analysis of consensus stability with time - dependent topology .",
    "uniformly joint connectedness , which requests the joint connection is connected for all intervals which are longer than some positive constant , has been employed for different consensus problems from discrete - time to continuous - time agent dynamics , from directed to undirected interconnection topologies @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the distributed asynchronous iterations , while @xcite proved the consensus of a simplified vicsek model .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite investigated the jointly - connected coordination for second - order agent dynamics .",
    "a nonlinear continuous - time model was discussed in @xcite with directed communications , in which convergence to a consensus is shown to be uniform within bounded initial conditions .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3-joint connection requires the joint connection is connected for infinitely many disjoint intervals in @xmath4 $ ] , which was discussed in @xcite for consensus seeking of discrete - time agents . this connectivity concept was then extended in continuous - time distributed control analysis for target set convergence and state agreement in @xcite .",
    "communication over networks is typically unreliable and with channel noise , which has attracted researchers to look at the robustness of consensus algorithms @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "robustness performance was discussed for average consensus algorithms .",
    "then in @xcite , robust consensus was studied under directed communication graphs for discrete - time systems . for continuous - time multi - agent systems ,",
    "robustness of consensus was established by an @xmath5 bound for networks of single integrators with a fixed directed communication graph @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "robust consensus with diverse input delays and asymmetric interconnection perturbations was discussed for a second - order leader - following model .",
    "recently , an optimal synchronization protocol was studied for discrete - time double integrators subject to process noise @xcite .",
    "clearly , robustness of consensus algorithms subject to noise highly relies on the convergence rate for the algorithm in the absence of noise .",
    "the concept of @xmath2-convergence time , was introduced to quantify the convergence speed for discrete - time consensus algorithms .",
    "it is defined as the minimum time steps required for the network to reach a certain level of consensus captured by a parameter @xmath2 .",
    "bounds of @xmath2-convergence time have been widely established in the literature for first - order discrete - time dynamics @xcite , and recently a sharp bound was presented in @xcite indicating that the convergence time is of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of nodes in the network and @xmath8 is a lower bound for the time interval in the definition of uniformly joint connectedness .",
    "few results have been obtained on the convergence rates for continuous - time multi - agent systems reaching a consensus with general joint connectivity assumptions . the robustness consensus analysis for continuous - time systems a challenging problem . a quantitative answer to",
    "how much noise can be dealt with by how much communication is still missing .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to establish the convergence towards a consensus for first - order , continuous - time multi - agent systems with communication noise for general directed and time - varying interconnection graphs .",
    "borrowing ideas from input - to - state stability ( iss ) and integral input - to - state stability ( iiss ) @xcite , we define robust consensus and integral robust consensus for the relative - position - based continuous - time coordination protocol which was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "we present explicit convergence bounds for the system with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 norms of the disturbances .",
    "sufficient and necessary connectivity conditions are obtained for the system to reach robust consensus or integral robust consensus , respectively , for directed and bidirectional communications .",
    "consequently , the upper bounds for the @xmath2-convergence time are established under uniform or non - uniform joint connections , as a simple special case of the robust consensus analysis . to the best of our knowledge , the results from this analysis are the first to show that consensus is reached exponentially in @xmath9 with uniformly joint connected graphs , while  exponentially \" in the times that the joint graph are connected with @xmath3-joint connection for the considered systems .",
    "different with most existing work , we build the whole analysis on a generalized integral assumption for the weight functions , which covers a large amount of common functions .",
    "additionally , a class of event - triggered coordination rules is studied as the application of the robust consensus results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "some preliminary concepts are introduced .",
    "we set up the system model , present our standing assumptions and main results in section 3 .",
    "then convergence analysis is carried out for directed and bidirectional graphs in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we turn to event - triggered consensus in section 6 , as an application of the results obtained in previous sections . finally , concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
