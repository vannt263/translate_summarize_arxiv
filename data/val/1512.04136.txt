    "in the dynamical description of a many - body problem it is common to approximate the full dynamics by one - body hamiltonians . within the one - body approach each constituent experiences the mean field due to all the other constituents particles .",
    "the original many - body system is replaced , in first approximation , by a system of independent particles whose wave function can be represented by a slater determinant for fermion systems .",
    "such an approximation does not provide an explanation for all the properties of the many - body problem and breaks down at some point .",
    "one can find in the literature various techniques to incorporate further dynamical details of the many - body dynamics in the description of such complex problems .",
    "the nuclear shell model , the hartree - fock approximation used in the description of atomic and nuclear systems or the description of electrons in metals provide well known examples where one - body hamiltonians are used as starting point to analyse the full system . in what concerns the electronic properties of graphene , typically and as a first approximation ,",
    "one relies in a independent particle picture either by using a tight - binding model or the free dirac equation .",
    "the full problem , however , is a complex many - body problem even if one does not take into account impurities and other sources of disorder  @xcite .",
    "from the technological point of view , the understanding on how the electronic properties of graphene change due to defects , impurities , sources of disorder or deformations is crucial  see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "in graphene there are many possible sources of disorder such as the presence of charged impurities of the substrate , of resonant scatters , of structural defects , of strain fluctuations just to name a few .",
    "the different types of disorder can be translated into new electron interactions which , in principle , lead to new spectroscopic and transport observable phenomena .",
    "disorder introduces , typically , some random behaviour which requires , from the point of view of the theoretical approach , an averaging over various realisations of the associated random background interaction .    from the point of view of the one - body problem",
    ", the sources of disorder can be viewed as local changes in the single site energy or changes in the distance and/or angles between the carbon @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "these can be translated into local effective interactions to be added to the original hamiltonian . in graphene",
    ", the effects associated to a change of the overlap of the carbon orbitals can be rewritten introducing extra fields in the dirac equation , see sec .",
    "iv in  @xcite , or can be modelled using the dirac equation in curved spaces , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .    for the particular case of the dirac equation in curved space , the effects of the deformation can be translated into a redefinition of the electron fermi velocity @xmath6 , which becomes some kind of local field .",
    "that means that it is possible to define an effective fermi velocity whose value is point dependent .",
    "another way of changing the fermi velocity is doping the pristine material .",
    "if the curvature of the graphene sheet together with disorder effects introduce random fluctuations , this effect can be studied by replacing @xmath6 by a random field whose mean value should reproduce the usual value @xmath7 .",
    "impurities or disorder are not the only mechanism that can modify the value of the fermi velocity .",
    "indeed , @xmath6 can differ from its standard value @xmath7 due to the many - body interactions  @xcite . in this sense , fluctuations of the fermi velocity",
    "can also be seen as a manifestation of the complex many - body problem in the dynamics of a single electron in a graphene sheet .",
    "if the fluctuations of the fermi velocity are a manifestation of the many - body problem , this suggests that the many - body problem itself can be mapped into a single particle equation via the introduction of random fields . in this case , an average over the random fields is required in order to produce meaningful results . recall that",
    "in condensed matter physics , another way of taking into account various forces in the dynamics of the electron is to replace its mass by the effective mass tensor which can be viewed also as another field to be taken into account .    in the present work ,",
    "we aim to explore the possibility of incorporating the dynamics of many - body problem through the introduction of random fields that are coupled to the electron field .",
    "although , herein we focus in graphene , the technique can be applied straightforwardly to any quantum system .    the use of stochastic and random process to understand a many - body problem has been explored , using a different perspective , in different areas of physics ranging from the study of the dirac spectrum in qcd  @xcite , to nuclear reactions  @xcite , complex systems  @xcite or condensed matter  @xcite among others .    in what concerns the use of random fields to investigate graphene properties , several examples can be found in the literature . in  @xcite",
    "the electronic states for disordered graphene dots of finite size in relation to quantum chaotic behaviour were investigated . in  @xcite ,",
    "the effects of disordered ripples on the conductivity of a monolayer graphene flake was studied .",
    "although invoking random fields or some sources of randomness , conceptually our proposal differs substantially from those mentioned .",
    "similar ideas can be applied to the dynamics of quantum mechanical systems coupled to white noise  @xcite .    as starting point to understand the electronic properties of graphene we use a continuum language . in this framework ,",
    "the spinor field associated to the electrons is a solution of the dirac equation .",
    "the inclusion of further details of the many - body electronic problem is performed by introducing random scalar fields @xmath8 s , which couple linearly to fermion operators .",
    "moreover , one assumes that @xmath8 have no dynamics but their values are distributed accordingly to a normal probability distribution . in principle , one could consider different types of probability distributions , but for a system with a large number of constituents , invoking the central limit theorem , the gaussian distribution is a natural choice .",
    "furthermore , by employing a gaussian distribution , the new average associated with @xmath8 can be performed exactly .",
    "similarly to what was seen in quantum mechanics  @xcite , the integration over the random fields leads to a new effective hamiltonian @xmath9 which contains only the original fermion fields and new two - body interactions , i.e. the one - body hamiltonian defined before introducing the coupling to the random field gives rise to a two - body hamiltonian .",
    "the new effective hamiltonian is non - hermitian and to understand the dynamics associated to @xmath9 we look at different types of coupling .",
    "the dynamical equation associated with @xmath9 is formally equivalent to a nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "this type of equation is used in many branches of science as in hydrodynamical phenomena , nonlinear optics , nonlinear acoustics , quantum condensates , heat pulses in solids , quantum chaos and various dissipative phenomena .",
    "the fluctuations due to the random fields enable the definition of various types of correlation functions where the combined role of the fluctuations and dissipation can be investigated simultaneously . although , we write all the necessary formalism to analyse the contributions coming from the fluctuations to any correlation function , herein we focus only on the dissipative part .",
    "we find that , for graphene , our theoretical approach enables to compute the charge carriers width that is consistent with the recently measure results  @xcite .",
    "the system discussed in the current work is targeted to graphene using the dirac equation as a starting point .",
    "however , the approach is sufficiently general and can be applied to other problems .",
    "natural candidates where the properties derived below are those materials which can also be described , in first approximation , by a dirac equation such as silicene or germanene .",

    "indeed , the data is well reproduced by @xmath138 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given in @xmath139 .",
    "this suggests that the essential contribution to the electron width in graphene are associated to the random fields that couple to the mass operator @xmath99 and the energy operator as given by @xmath140 .",
    "the contribution associated to the fluctuations of the fermi velocity seem to give a marginal contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "the prediction  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) gives a @xmath0 that is quadratic in the gap energy , i.e. in @xmath141 . in this sense , changing the doping or the graphene substrate dislocates the experimental data accordingly .    in  @xcite",
    "besides the experimental measure of @xmath0 , a theoretical calculation of the decay rates for highly excited electrons in graphene is made .",
    "although their theoretical computation underestimates the experimental value by 20 - 30% , the authors look at the relative contributions to @xmath0 due to the electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions .",
    "it turns out that the contribution of the electron - phonon interaction seems to be independent of the fermi energy . on the other hand",
    ", the electron - electron interaction grows with @xmath1 .",
    "it is curious to observe that in ( [ eq : gamma ] ) the constant term is associate to the electron mass term , while the term which grows with @xmath1 is connected with an interaction that is proportional to the energy of the many - electron system .",
    "in this paper , we propose to study the many - body problem of electrons in graphene through the consideration of random fields .",
    "although , the work described here uses graphene as inspiration , the conclusions of our investigation are valid to any material that can be described , in first approximation , by a dirac equation as e.g. silicene or germanene .",
    "the introduction of the random variables can be viewed as a way to incorporate statistically the details of the interaction in a many - body system .",
    "assuming that the random fields have a gaussian distribution , it is possible to integrate their contribution exactly using functional methods .",
    "the interplay between the two types of averages considered , a functional integration over the electron fields and a functional integration over the random fields , allows to investigate dissipation and fluctuations properties , which are a manifestation of the complex dynamics of the many - body problem .",
    "although , in the present work we provide all the ingredients to look at the fluctuation terms of the different green s functions , we focused on the dissipative nature of the interaction .",
    "the use of functional methods allows to integrate exactly the contribution of the random fields and identify a non - hermitian and dissipative effective hamiltonian @xmath9 . starting from a one - body hamiltonian",
    ", the integration of the random fields builds an hamiltonian with two - body interactions .",
    "the non - hermitian and dissipative terms in @xmath9 are proportional to the fluctuations of the random fields .",
    "furthermore , they vanish when the distribution associated to the random fields approaches a delta function distribution , i.e. in the limit of zero fluctuations .    the analysis of the perturbative solution for two different types of coupling shows that the eigenstates of @xmath9 have , typically , complex eigenvalues and , therefore , the corresponding states have a finite lifetime .",
    "for the so called massless case , see sec .",
    "[ massless ] , one of the electron states is stable but the other gets a width proportional to the charge carrier momentum . from small charge carrier momentum ,",
    "the width essentially vanishes , and the corresponding quantum states are effectively stable . on the other hand , the states of @xmath9 coming from coupling the random fields to a mass term , see sec .",
    "[ massive ] , produces eigenstates that have always a finite width and lifetime .",
    "the perturbative solution of the cases devised in secs  [ massless ] and  [ massive ] gives a first flavour to the full quantum field theoretical problem associated to @xmath9 .    in sec .",
    "[ meanfield ] , we investigated a more general type of coupling between the electron and the random fields and attempted a hartree mean field solution of the many - body problem with the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the computation of the @xmath9 eigenvalues shows that the charge carriers have , in general , finite widths .",
    "furthermore , we look at how the width @xmath0 changes with the charge carrier fermi energy @xmath1",
    ". this allows us to compare our prediction for @xmath2 with recent available experimental data for graphene .",
    "the good agreement between the theoretical prediction for @xmath2 and the experimental data suggests that , indeed , one can describe the many - body problem of an electron in graphene , or other similar materials , via the introduction of random fields as considered in the current work .    a final remark concerning the effect of fluctuations on the averaged green s function .",
    "the procedure described above using functional integration and ending up dealing with an effective theory governed by a non - hermitian hamiltonian , can also be used to analyze the fluctuation contribution .",
    "the fluctuation effects are embedded in the equation that defines the full green s function , which is described by the so - called pastur equation @xcite .",
    "the analytical solution of this equation is difficult to obtain . on the other hand ,",
    "the pastur equation is amenable to numerical treatment , which will be investigated in a future publication .",
