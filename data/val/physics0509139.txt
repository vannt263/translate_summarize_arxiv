    "for a long time microstrip antennas have been miniaturized using different material fillings between the radiating element and the ground plane @xcite .",
    "most traditionally , high permittivity dielectrics have been used to decrease the physical dimensions of the radiator @xcite .",
    "common problems encountered with high permittivity substrates include e.g.  the excitation of surface waves leading to lowered radiation efficiency and pattern degradation , and difficulties in impedance matching of the antenna . during the first heyday of so called metamaterials , artificial high - permeability materials working in the microwave regime",
    "have gained increasing attention @xcite@xcite . the possibility to create artificial magnetism at microwave frequencies",
    "has heated the discussion on the possibility to enhance the impedance bandwidth properties of planar radiators using magneto - dielectric substrates @xcite@xcite or other electromagnetically exotic substrates @xcite .",
    "according to the work of hansen and burke @xcite , inductive ( magnetic ) loading leads to an efficient size miniaturization of a microstrip antenna . a transmission - line ( tl ) model for a normal half - wavelength patch antenna",
    "predicts that increase in the permeability of the antenna substrate does not reduce the impedance bandwidth of the miniaturized radiator ( when the material parameters are _ dispersion - free _ , and @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "edvardsson @xcite derived a condition for the radiation quality factor @xmath1 of a planar inverted f - antenna ( pifa ) , and concluded that increase in the permeability allows size miniaturization without increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , to draw a general conclusion on the practical applicability of the magnetic loading e.g.  with mobile phone antennas , there are three things which need to be clarified : i ) the effect of frequency dispersion of the substrate .",
    "practically realizable artificial magnetic medium operating at microwave frequencies is composed of electrically small resonating metal unit cells , thus , the magneto - dielectric substrate obeys strong frequency dispersion .",
    "even though the substrate can be considered as a paramagnetic medium when using plane wave excitation ( at the macroscopic level , over a certain frequency range ) , the performance is not so obvious to predict when the resonant substrate is coupled to the antenna element .",
    "ii ) the effect of high @xmath2 compared to @xmath3 over the matching band of the antenna . with practically realizable artificial magneto - dielectric substrates for microwave frequencies",
    "re@xmath4 is known to be rather moderate , thus in practice it seems very difficult to achieve the condition @xmath5 ( outside the resonant region of the substrate ) .",
    "iii ) the effect of losses .",
    "realistic model representing the losses of the substrate is needed to correctly predict the behavior of the susceptance seen at the antenna terminal ( further , the quality factor ) . moreover",
    ", the numerical and experimental results found in the literature @xcite@xcite do not offer a complete , quantitative comparison scheme applicable for practical antenna design . according to the authors knowledge , the impedance bandwidths ( quality factors ) of reduced size antennas loaded with practically realizable , artificial , dispersive magneto - dielectrics",
    "have not been compared to the results obtained using high - permittivity dielectrics leading to the same size reduction .",
    "when thinking of practical antenna design , this quantitative comparison is clearly needed to make decisions whether or not the possibly enhanced impedance bandwidth outweights e.g.  the increased manufacturing cost and substrate weight .    in real life",
    "large permeabilities for microwave materials are achieved with a complex mixture of electrically small inhomogeneities ( resonating unit cells ) loaded into a substrate in a specific periodic arrangement . in the present paper",
    "we shortly discuss the possibilities to enhance artificial magnetism at microwave frequencies , and construct a tl model taking into account realistic dispersive behavior of a practically realizable artificial magneto - dielectric substrate .",
    "we start the analysis by reproducing the known miniaturization results with static material parameters , and further extend the study to take into account frequency dispersion .",
    "it is shown that a substrate obeying the lorentzian type dispersion for magnetic permeability leads to a narrower impedance bandwidth than a high - permittivity substrate offering the same size reduction .",
    "physical reason for the phenomena is clarified .",
    "a prototype antenna is constructed and the observation is experimentally validated .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way : in section ii we briefly revise the numerical and experimental results found in the literature for magneto - dielectric loading of microstrip antennas .",
    "section iii presents a short discussion on practically realizable artificial magnetic media and the used tl - model is presented in detail in section iv .",
    "section v presents the calculated impedance bandwidth properties in different loading scenarios , and an experimental demonstration is presented in section vi .",
    "the work is concluded in section vii .",
    "mosallaei and sarabandi applied in @xcite a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulation scheme and investigated antenna miniaturization using a band - gap substrate consisting of dielectric and magneto - dielectric ( z - type hexaferrite ) layers .",
    "constant scalar - permeability assumption was used with substrate material parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 at 277 mhz .",
    "magneto - dielectric substrate was shown to lead to a significantly wider impedance bandwidth than a pure dielectric substrate offering the same size reduction .",
    "the same authors introduced in @xcite an embedded circuit metamaterial structure and utilized it under a patch antenna operating at 2.3 ghz ( fdtd simulations ) . a 1.5 percent fractional bandwidth was demonstrated for a 0.075@xmath8 size patch antenna with lossless , dispersion - free substrate material parameters ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the authors did not , however , present any result for high permittivity dielectrics leading to the same size reduction .",
    "al _ @xcite measured the performance of a patch antenna utilizing an embedded circuit metamaterial at 250 mhz , and reported that miniaturization factors as high as 6.4 ( with @xmath10 0.83 percent ) could be achieved .",
    "however , the radiation efficiency was measured to be only 21.6 percents , and a comparative measurement with high - permittivity dielectrics was not conducted .",
    "yoon and ziolkowski @xcite simulated a microstrip antenna with different material fillings ( dispersion - free material parameters ) , and came to the conclusion that the optimal condition for the effective substrate material parameters is the same as predicted by hansen and burke @xcite , and edvardsson @xcite ( @xmath11 ) . in @xcite krkkinen",
    "al _ numerically studied a pifa with dispersive magnetic material filling .",
    "the authors pointed out the need to regard the loaded radiator as a system of two coupled resonators , rather than a radiator loaded with a static paramagnetic load .",
    "the conclusion was that if the resonance of the material is considerably higher than the resonance of the empty antenna , the material loading enables size reduction while approximately retaining the fractional bandwidth .",
    "the effective permittivity of the substrate was assumed to be unity , and the design utilizing dispersive magnetic filling was not challenged against a design utilizing dispersion - free dielectrics offering the same size reduction .",
    "ermutlu _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite loaded the volume under a half - wavelength patch antenna with a practically realizable artificial magneto - dielectric material , and concluded based on numerical and experimental results that significant miniaturization factors could be achieved while the bandwidth of the loaded antenna is approximately retained .",
    "the results were not , however , challenged against results obtained using high - permittivity substrates .",
    "authors of @xcite proposed two utilization schemes for a resonant magnetic media with planar radiators .",
    "the volume under a pifa was loaded with an array of metasolenoids @xcite and the impedance bandwidth properties were experimentally investigated .",
    "when utilizing the resonant region of the metasolenoids , the authors designed a multiresonant antenna with significantly enhanced impedance bandwidth . according to the second suggestion",
    ", the metasolenoid array would behave as a paramagnetic load enabling efficient antenna miniaturization , air filling leads to the best figure of merit . ] .",
    "authors of @xcite loaded the volume under a half - wavelength patch antenna with an array of metasolenoids and compared the impedance bandwidth to that obtained using high - permittivity dielectrics .",
    "the result indicated that there is practically no advantage when using the metasolenoid array .",
    "attempts have also been conducted to miniaturize the size of planar antennas by partially filling the volume under the radiating element with backward - wave materials @xcite . with patch antennas , in practise , filling the volume with backward - wave material corresponds to inserting bulk inductors and capacitors to the antenna @xcite , thus the technique is very similar to the well known technique of size miniaturization using reactive loads .",
    "moreover , as expected , material obeying realistic dispersive behavior results in significantly narrower impedance bandwidth than the hypothetical material with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we restrict the discussion only to artificial magnetic media composed of resonating metal unit cells . other ways to enhance the magnetic response include e.g.  the utilization of ferrites , or composites filled with ferromagnetic inclusions @xcite . in general ,",
    "resonant artificial magnetic media can be utilized with planar radiators in two principal ways @xcite : if the resonance of the material lies inside the operational band of the ( loaded ) radiator , with a suitable coupling the resonance of the material can be combined with the antenna resonance , thus a multiresonant antenna is achieved . in other words , radiating particles are used instead of a real material filling . another way is to design the material to resonate at a considerably higher frequency than the operational frequency of the loaded radiator . in the latter case",
    "it is important that the utilized material retains its effective magnetic properties over a wide frequency band , meaning that inside the operational band of the radiator the value of the real part of the effective permeability is larger than unity , re@xmath13 ( low losses are another desired feature ) .",
    "this allows one to consider the material as a paramagnetic load with ( almost ) constant real part for the effective permeability over the desired frequency range .",
    "a paramagnetic load will increase the inductance of the resonator , and many authors consider this as an advantage when trying to retain the impedance bandwidth characteristics in antenna miniaturization with material fillings , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the problem with most of the introduced designs for artificial magnetic media operating in the microwave regime @xcite@xcite is the fact that the effective magnetism rapidly vanishes as the frequency deviates from the particle resonance .",
    "usually the maximum predicted value for the real part of the effective permeability of artificial magnetic medium ( with realistic bulk concentration / volume filling ratio and loss factor ) is re@xmath14 at the resonance @xcite .",
    "this means that in practice re@xmath4 of the magneto - dielectric substrate approaches unity very quickly as the frequency deviates from the material resonance .",
    "so in practice one should utilize the particles rather close to their resonance to achieve a condition re@xmath15 .",
    "this further increases the effect of frequency dispersion in the impedance bandwidth characteristics .",
    "moreover , it might not be clear anymore if the loaded antenna should be considered as a system of two coupled resonators rather than a resonator filled with a homogenous , dispersion - free material .",
    "in addition to this , usually the real part of the effective permittivity of magneto - dielectric substrates is considerably higher than the real part of the effective permeability ( when the substrate is utilized well below its resonance ) .",
    "thus , at microwave frequencies the condition considered e.g.  by hansen and burke ( @xmath0 ) @xcite seems unlikely to be achieved with a resonant media composed of metal unit cells .",
    "for example , with the structure presented in @xcite a realistic value for the real part of the effective permeability over the operational band of a patch antenna ( operating well enough below the magneto - dielectric substrate resonance ) is re@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , at the same time the real part of the effective permittivity can be as high as re@xmath17 , even if the host substrate has a low value for the relative permittivity @xcite .    to give a link between the presented effective medium model and practical design for artificial magnetic media , we need to choose a unit cell for the media . in the present work we consider the metasolenoid @xcite as an example unit cell for practically realizable artificial magnetic media .",
    "[ meta_meas ] .  introduces the structural geometry of the metasolenoid .",
    "metasolenoid is chosen due to its simple structural geometry enabling rather straightforward , yet accurate theoretical analysis .",
    "moreover , experimental results can be found in the literature for the utilization of the metasolenoid under microstrip antennas @xcite , and the effective medium model has been experimentally validated and found to be accurate @xcite .",
    "in this section we will derive expressions for the input impedance @xmath18 and unloaded quality factor @xmath19 of an arbitrary size strip fed patch antenna ( lying on top of a large , non - resonant ground plane ) .",
    "the impedance level seen directly at the patch edge is usually very high causing difficulties in impedance matching of the antenna .",
    "the strip feeding allows one to conveniently tune the impedance level seen at the feeding point , thus it offers a possibility to tune the matching in different scenarios . a schematic illustration of the analyzed antenna structure and the equivalent tl - model are presented in fig .  [ sche ] .",
    "the characteristic impedance of a wide microstrip line reads @xcite : z = , z where @xmath20 is the wave impedance in free space , @xmath21 is the height of the substrate ( assumed to be the same as the height of the patch from the ground plane ) , @xmath22 is the length of the patch , and @xmath3 and @xmath2 are the effective substrate material parameters .    in the present model we neglect the effect of the material filling to the radiation conductance and the shunt susceptance representing the open end extension of the tl .",
    "this is possible if the material filling leaves the ends of the patch free so that there is a short ( about the patch height ) section of the empty tl just near the radiating edges ( in the present analysis the length of the empty section @xmath23 ) . with this assumption the radiation conductance and shunt susceptance read @xcite : @xmath24 @xmath25 g_r",

    "the propagation factor in the antenna part of the tl is of the following form = k_0 , [ beta ] where @xmath29 is the free space wave number .",
    "for the input impedance of the antenna we can write z_in = z_f , [ zin ] where @xmath30 is the impedance seen from the reference plane of the first radiating slot and @xmath31 is the length of the feed strip .",

    "[ roo ] to relate the unloaded quality factor to the return loss characteristics , we regard the antenna as a parallel - resonant rlc circuit in the vicinity of the fundamental resonant frequency @xcite .",

    "let us assume that the criterion for the maximum vswr inside of the band of interest is s. [ vswr ] in this case the fractional bandwidth can be expressed as @xcite bw = , [ bwr ] where @xmath19 is the unloaded quality factor of the parallel resonator . knowing the dispersive behavior of the input return loss , @xmath19 can be solved from ( [ bwr ] ) .",
    "a half - wavelength patch antenna fed directly at the patch edge operates as a parallel resonant circuit when @xmath37 .",
    "the feed strip can be interpreted as an additional inductance placed in series with the rest of the circuit .",
    "this inductance will create a series resonance above the parallel resonance , and usually the antenna operates in between the series and the parallel resonance .",
    "the dispersive behavior of the metasolenoid array is of the following form @xcite ( see fig .",

    "[ ztot ] the effective permittivity of the metasolenoid array does not equal to that of the host substrate relative permittivity ( @xmath40 )",
