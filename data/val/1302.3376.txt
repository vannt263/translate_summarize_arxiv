    "the traditional view of stellar clusters as simple stellar populations ( ssp - i.e. all stars have the same age and metallicity within some small tolerance ) has recently been called into question due to the discovery of multiple main sequences , horizontal branches , turn - offs , and sub - giant branches in the old globular ( @xmath1  gyr ) clusters in the galaxy ( e.g. , bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , it is currently unclear if this is a general property of massive stellar clusters , or if this feature is unique to the globular clusters .",
    "high precision photometry of intermediate age ( @xmath2  gyr ) clusters in the lmc has shown that while the main - sequence and giant branches are well described by an ssp model , the main sequence turn - off is broader than would be expected , even when photometric errors are taken into account ( e.g. , mackey & broby nielsen  2007 , milone et al .",
    "2009 , goudfrooij et al .",
    "2011a , b ) .",
    "this broadening has been taken as evidence for a significant age spread within the clusters ( @xmath3  myr ) , which if true , could provide vital clues into how the multiple populations in globular clusters formed ( e.g. conroy & spergel  2011 , keller , mackey , & da costa  2011 ) .",
    "alternatives explanations to age spreads have been put forward to explain the extended main sequence turnoff ( emsto ) seen in lmc clusters .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2011 ) have suggested that interacting binaries can create an emsto as well as a dual red clump , observed in some intermediate age clusters ( girardi et al .",
    "additionally , bastian & de mink  ( 2009 ; see also yang , bi , & meng  2012 ) suggested that stellar rotation may be able to produce an emsto due to the change in luminosity and colour in rapidly rotating stars although this scenario has been called into question ( girardi et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "if massive intermediate age clusters do host significant age spreads or multiple populations , this could provide a promising avenue to understand the multiple populations observed in globular clusters .",
    "indeed , there have been many recent works that have attempted to link the suggested age spread in the intermediate age lmc clusters with globular clusters ( e.g. , conroy & spergel  2011 , keller et al .",
    "these works have suggested that massive clusters ( @xmath4 ) clusters have deep enough potentials to retain material lost due to stellar evolution of the first generation of stars and potentially accrete new material from their surroundings .",
    "if such material can be retained , a second ( or multiple ) populations of stars can be formed within the existing cluster .",
    "this is similar to models put forward to explain the multiple populations within globular clusters ( e.g. , de mink et al  2009 , and references therein ) , although such models may require a larger population of first generation stars than can be accommodated by observations of the number of field stars within the host galaxy ( larsen , strader , & brodie  2012 ) .",
    "other studies have suggested that age spreads may be present in young ( @xmath5  myr ) , massive ( @xmath6 ) extragalactic clusters ( e.g. , larsen et al .  2011 ) .",
    "these potential age spreads are significantly less in duration , being tens of myr , instead of hundreds of myr in the intermediate age lmc clusters .",
    "however , the authors conclude that interacting binaries or other effects may explain the results without resorting to age spreads , especially as the estimated spread in ages appears to be correlated to the age of the cluster ( larsen et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in the present work",
    "we look for significant age spreads in two massive clusters in the lmc , ngc  1856 and ngc  1866 .",
    "both clusters are massive ( @xmath7 , see table  [ tab : objects ] for the basic cluster properties ) and have properties similar to clusters showing the emsto feature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mass_reff ] ) .",
    "if the age spreads in the intermediate age lmc clusters are real , we would expect to find similar age spreads in these two clusters .",
    "both clusters have been studied previously , in particular ngc  1866 has an extensive history of being used for calibration of stellar evolutionary models ( see rosenfield et al .  in prep , for an extensive review ) .",

    "one feature that should be noted is that the observed main sequence extends to brighter magnitudes than the predictions of the hess diagram for the best fit age , by @xmath17  mag .",
    "these stars could be due to a younger generation , although evidence against this is seen in the lack of corresponding post - main sequence ( i.e. , helium burning ) stars .",
    "alternatively , these stars could be due to binaries in the cluster and/or crowding in the images since the observations are focussed on the relatively dense core of the cluster .    in order to provide a more quantitative measure of possible age spreads within ngc  1866",

    "we refer to the reader to the above works for details on the fitting procedure .",
    "photometric errors were included in the fits , and we chose boxes in the cmds ( regions within the cmds to compare the observations with the isochrones ) with the following limits : for ngc  1866 @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the main sequence and @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the post - main sequence .",

    "this peak can be reduced or removed by including the effects of binaries in the fitting procedure , although crowding effects are likely to be contributing as well .",
    "however , the inclusion of binaries increases the dispersion of the main peak from 18  myr to 30  myr .    from this we can see that any possible age spread is limited to 30  myr of the peak age",
    "this is significantly less than the 100 - 500  myr expected from observations of the intermediate age clusters in the lmc .",
    "myr and a peak at @xmath24  myr , while for ngc  1856 we find a dispersion of 33.6  myr and a peak at 280  myr .",
    "the dispersions are upper limits to the true age distribution .",
    "the secondary peaks are driven by the handful of stars above the main sequence turn - off ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : ngc1866_hess ] & [ fig : ngc1856_hess ] ) , which are likely due to binaries and crowding effects in the central regions of the clusters , since no corresponding post - main sequence features are seen.,width=302 ]",
    "another of the most massive young ( @xmath25  gyr ) clusters in the lmc is ngc  1856 . using the mass and size estimated in the survey of macky & gilmore  ( 2003 ) , goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2011b ) suggest that this is the only cluster with an escape velocity , @xmath26 , larger than the empirically derived  critical \" escape velocity of @xmath27  km / s , hence that it should host multiple generations of stars within it .",
    "we can test this suggestion by studying the cmd of ngc  1856 presented in brocato et al .",

    "we restrict our analysis to the central 4.8  pc to minimise contamination of the sample .",
    "we also show theoretical hess diagrams for three different ages in the panels .    using the position and morphology of the helium burning stars we can constrain the age and",
    "any age spread present within the cluster . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1856_hess ] we see that the helium burning stars are best reproduced by the @xmath28  myr isochrone .",
    "however , due to the lower signal - to - noise of the data , the constraint on the possible age spread within the cluster ( based on helium burning star morphology ) is weaker than in the case of ngc  1866 .",
    "we can rule out significant populations of stars with ages less / more than @xmath29  myr than the best fit isochrone .    as in ngc  1866 , there are a handful of stars above the nominal main sequence turnoff .",
    "these are presumably binary stars and/or stars affected by crowding due to the high surface density of stars in the central parts of the cluster .",
    "the possibility of these stars representing a younger population is low , due to the lack of corresponding post - main sequence stars .",
    "we have also estimated the sfh of ngc  1856 using the same method as in   [ sec:1866 ] .",
    "for this cluster we adopted fitting boxes with limits of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the main sequence and @xmath21 and @xmath31 for the post - main sequence .",
    "we find @xmath32 , consistent with previous studies ( e.g. , kerber et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the estimated sfh is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1866_sfh ] as open circles .",
    "the dashed lines show two gaussian fits to the estimated distribution . we find a best fit age of 280  myr and a dispersion of @xmath33  myr . as in the case of ngc  1866 ,",
    "the secondary peak at younger ages is due to the handful of stars above the nominal main sequence of the best fit age , presumably due to binaries and crowding effects .",
    "we have tested the assertion that large age spreads ( @xmath34  myr ) are a common feature of massive clusters .",
    "these suggestions were based on previous studies of massive ( @xmath35 ) , intermediate age ( 1 - 3  gyr ) clusters that showed that the observed main sequence turnoff ( msto ) was broader than predicted by simple stellar population , which could be explained by an extended star - formation history . alternatively , it has been suggested that extended mstos ( emsto ) could be due to stellar rotation or interacting binaries .",
    "if the emstos are due to an age spread within the cluster , then it would be expected that younger clusters ( ages @xmath36  myr ) with similar properties ( mass and radius ) should show a clear age spread ( @xmath37  myr ) within them .",
    "such an age spread would be easily detectable through the analysis of their cmds .",
    "we note that the emsto clusters are generally better described by a continuous distribution of ages , rather than a bimodal distribution ( e.g. , goudfrooij et al .",
    "2011b ) .    using cmds based on hst imaging of two massive young clusters in the lmc ( ngc  1856 and ngc  1866 ; see table  [ tab : objects ] for their properties ) we find that both are consistent with a single burst of star formation , and place upper limits to possible age spreads within them of @xmath38  myr and @xmath39  myr for ngc  1866 and ngc  1856 , respectively ( fitting the derived sfh with a gaussian ) .",
    "these are upper limits to the true dispersion , as crowding , contamination , and differential extinction has not been taken into account ( additionally the errors in the observations introduce some minimum width to the best fit sfh ) .",
    "the lack of an age spread in each of these clusters is consistent with that found for massive ( @xmath40 ) young ( @xmath41  myr ) clusters in the galaxy , such as ngc  3603 and westerlund 1 ( e.g.  kudryavtseva et al .",
    "2012 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we show gaussian fits to the sfh of both clusters , as well as the expected distribution based on the inferred sfh of seven intermediate age clusters presented in goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2011b ) , which have been shifted to an age of 200  myr for comparison .",
    "the two clusters presented in the current work clearly do not match the inferred sfh of the intermediate age clusters .",
    "the lack of age spreads within the two young clusters in the current work can be interpreted in two ways . either the intermediate age clusters with emstos are fundamentally different than the clusters presented here in some intrinsic property ( although their masses and radii are comparable ) or the emsto feature observed in these clusters is not due to an age spread .",
    "alternative explanations for the emstos have been put forward in the literature , namely interacting binary stars ( yang et al .",
    "2011 ) and stellar rotation ( bastian & de mink  2009 ) .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have called the rotation scenario into question , by correctly pointing out that the models presented by bastian & de mink were not isochrones , as the influence of rotation on stellar lifetimes was not taken into account . when girardi et al .",
    "did correct for the changing lifetimes , the spread in the modelled msto decreased .",
    "however , we note that the rotation rate used by girardi et al . was rather low ( using the mean of the royer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) rotational distribution and not taking into account the significant numbers of more rapidly rotating stars ) and that their models did not show any difference between the rotating and non - rotating stars on the main sequence , although rotation should affect stellar structure and be observable on the main sequence ( e.g. , brott et al .  2011 ; ekstrm et al .  2012 ) .",
    "both of the clusters discussed here are well above the @xmath42  limit suggested by conroy and spergel  ( 2011 ) in order for clusters to host multiple populations .",
    "both clusters have an escape velocity of @xmath1  km / s ( after corrections for mass loss and change of radius , using the method discussed in goudfrooij et al .",
    "2011b ) which is larger than many of the clusters that display the emsto feature , and the clusters discussed here have similar properties as the emsto clusters .",
    "the observations presented here , of a lack of an age spread within two young massive clusters , suggests that the emsto feature in intermediate age clusters is not due to age spreads .",
    "this is also consistent with the lack of abundance spreads within intermediate age clusters ( e.g. , mucciarelli et al .",
    "2007 ) , and suggests that the emsto feature is not related to the multiple stellar populations seen in globular clusters .",
    "additionally , the observed colour spread in the emsto feature is similar in all intermediate age clusters observed to date , resulting in an age spread that is proportional to the age of the cluster , suggesting that other effects may be causing the emsto feature .        in a future work",
    ", we will present an analysis of the observed cmds of another @xmath43 young lmc / smc clusters .",
    "additionally , we will present modelling of each of the clusters , including the two clusters presented here , that involves a more realistic treatment of the errors as well as the effects of crowding and binarity . through this method",
