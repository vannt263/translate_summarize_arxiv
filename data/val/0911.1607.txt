    "an important step in better understanding casimir forces and their application to nano - scale environments is the nature and influence of the geometries used .",
    "if we consider a collection of small bodies and their interactions , a quantitative understanding is necessary to address any issue of applications .",
    "one can calculate the forces between bodies directly by using a stress tensor evaluated on the body in question .",
    "this is an experimentally accessible prediction of the theory e.g. three body forces can be measured between dielectric spheres  @xcite for critical casimir forces .",
    "the choice of stress tensor in media is not unique and depends on what consistency criteria is used .",
    "typically the differences will show up both in the scale of the forces and the higher order curvature corrections , and one may view this as a way of finding the correct low energy description .    to address the nature of such interactions between bodies  @xcite casimir interaction energies",
    "have been evaluated for collections of compact objects interacting with different force carrying fields ( electromagnetic and scalar ) .",
    "the approach taken has been to evaluate a suitable energy functional integral using a t - matrix , whereby an interaction energy can be deduced , normalised with respect to their energy when separated at infinity .    in this",
    "talk i summarise recent work we have done on calculating the casimir force on a single sphere , in an @xmath0-sphere setup  @xcite . by using a multiple scattering approach to evaluate essentially the classical scattering green s function of the configuration , we are able to evaluate the force directly on the sphere .",
    "the total path length plays a fundamental role and what leads one to a loop description  @xcite .",
    "similar loop descriptions have appeared before in  @xcite where a semi - classical type expression of the density of states is found , and in  @xcite a worldline description for scalar fields is given .",
    "the question we are addressing is how to calculate the force on a particular sphere as a result of all the interactions with the remaining spheres in a particular static configuration .",
    "the casimir force on a sphere ( given by the ball @xmath1 ) in the @xmath2-direction due to the effects of the @xmath0-sphere system is given by @xmath3 the stress tensor we choose is the standard vacuum expression ( which is consistent with the lorentz force law  @xcite ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 and it is understood that we are taking the limit for the initial and final points .",
    "we then need to evaluate the scattering correlation functions ( whilst dropping the direct modes of propagation ) @xmath6 and similarly for magnetic fields . to construct the scattering two point function",
    "we write the fields in a mode decomposition  @xcite of spherical vector wave functions that are centred on each sphere centre . then by applying the standard continuity equations at each of the spheres surfaces ,",
    "one can calculate the out modes in terms of the in modes and scattering ( mie ) coefficients . assuming that the background in which we are evaluating this is filled with quantum noise such that the noise - current two point function is non - zero we find for the @xmath0-body force on a sphere ( suppressing the @xmath7 indices ) @xmath8&=&-(-1)^n\\frac{\\hbar } { 4\\pi } r[1 ]   \\im \\int_{0}^{\\infty}d\\omega k \\coth ( \\hbar \\omega /k_bt)\\langle\\mathbf{1}| [ \\alpha^{1}(\\omega r[1 ] ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times   \\sum_{i=2}^{n}a^{1,i}(\\mathbf{r}[1,i ] ) \\cdot \\alpha^{i } ( \\omega r[i ] ) \\cdots   \\cdots \\sum_{j=2}^{n}a^{i , j}(\\mathbf{r}[i , j ] ) \\cdot \\alpha^{j } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\sum^n_{j=2}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}[j,1 ] } a^{j,1}(\\mathbf{r}[j,1 ] ) ] j(kr[1 ] ) h^{+}(kr[1])w(\\omega r[1 ] ) |\\mathbf{1}\\rangle .",

    "a wick rotation to imaginary frequencies has been performed and the @xmath16-function has been defined for later reference .",
    "note the explicit form of the translation matrices involve exponentials of the inter - sphere separations  @xcite and thus it is the _ total path length _ that plays the key role in understanding the variables of the system . for simple setups ( e.g. two and three sphere systems ) we can evaluate equation  ( [ eq : nsphereforce2 ] ) in different perturbative regimes e.g. retarded or non - retarded limits using static values for the permittivities ( see  @xcite for explicit evaluations and force plots of two and three sphere systems ) .",
    "following on from the observation that equation  ( [ eq : nsphereforce2 ] ) involves the total path length in the form of a loop , in  @xcite an attempt is made to develop this further .",
    "it is similar to the path integrals used in  @xcite and  @xcite where a fictitious time is introduced as well as mass scale set equal to unity and an appearance of planck s constant in the particle action . as pointed out in  @xcite ,",
    "it is misleading to call this a semi - classical evaluation because of the absence of the dimensionful planck s constant .",
    "concurrent with this is the absence of a mass or length scale with which to define a dimensionless action .    in  @xcite a symbolic expression for the @xmath16-function",

    "the connection @xmath23 is formed from the background potentials in which the field propagates .",
    "one now needs to find a representation of this object .",
    "in fact it can be given a path integral representation , albeit a classical one i.e. no @xmath24 featuring anywhere .",
