    "the unavoidable interaction of a quantum system with its environment usually destroys its coherence and quantumness @xcite . the fragile quantum information encoded in an open quantum system is lost due to the presence of the environment that continuously monitors the system .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases the lost information can be partly restored due to non - negligible correlations between system and environment .",
    "we refer to the systems in which such re - coherence phenomena occur as non - markovian open quantum systems .",
    "the dynamics of open quantum systems has been often described using the born - markov approximation leading to a master equation of the lindblad form @xcite .",
    "this approximation , however , neglecting system - bath induced memory effects , does not lead to a correct description of the dynamics of many relevant systems in quantum optics and solid state physics , and can not be used in certain quantum information processing scenario @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the spirit of reservoir engineering , one can induce non - markovianity to improve quantum protocols such as quantum metrology and quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "the concept of non - markovianity is not uniquely defined in the literature .",
    "several measures have been proposed in recent years @xcite and , in general , these measures do not coincide in detecting non - markovianity . in this paper",
    "we focus on two measures of non - markovianity : the breuer - laine - piilo ( blp ) measure @xcite based on state distinguishability , and the bylicka - chruciski - maniscalco ( bcm ) measure @xcite based on entanglement assisted and/or quantum capacities . in the first case",
    "the characteristic trait of non - markovianity is a backflow of information , i.e. , a partial increase in state distinguishability , while in the second case memory effects are identified with a regrowth of channel capacities .    it is known that for single qubit dephasing channels , as those considered in the following , the markovian or non - markovian character of the dynamical map coincides for all measures .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to study one of them . in this paper",
    "we focus on both the blp measure and the bcm measure as we are interested not only in understanding information back flow but also in investigating under which conditions qubit channels subject to random classical noise may be exploited for reliably transmitting quantum and classical information . moreover",
    ", the bcm measure provides us with a rigorous information theoretical description of memory effects by linking the amount of information on the system to the amount of information on the environment , and therefore allowing us to properly define the concept of information flow .",
    "we focus on non - markovianity arising in classical environments exhibiting non - gaussian fluctuations , i.e. described by random non - gaussian fields .",
    "in particular , we address the influence of this class of environments on the dynamics of a qubit . as a matter of fact",
    ", little attention has been paid to non - markovianity in classical environments , most of the existing studies are devoted to time - independent random fields or to gaussian dynamic noise @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "stochastic processes characterized by non - gaussian fluctuations are very common in nature and have received large attention @xcite .",
    "a stochastic process is non - gaussian if it can not be fully characterized by the mean and variance . as a consequence ,",
    "the mere knowledge of the spectrum is not sufficient to describe the process , and the very structure of environment plays a role in determining its influence on the coherence properties of quantum systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on two relevant classes of non - gaussian noise : the random telegraph noise ( rtn ) with a lorentzian spectrum and the family of low - frequency noise with @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "the rtn is generated from a bistable fluctuator flipping between two values with a switching rate @xmath2 .",
    "rtn allows one to model environmental noise appearing in many semiconducting and superconducting nanodevices @xcite .",
    "noises with @xmath1 spectra are found when the environment can be described as a collection of @xmath3 random bistable fluctuators , with @xmath4 .",
    "it affects solid - state devices , superconducting qubits , and magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the dynamical map of a qubit interacting with these kind of environments describes pure dephasing . in this case",
    "the channel is degradable and the entanglement - assisted capacity coincides with the quantum channel capacity , hence we will consider only the latter one in the rest of the paper .",
    "moreover , a simple analytical expressions for the dynamics of both the trace distance and the quantum capacity exists , allowing us to analyze in detail the non - markovian dynamics as a function of the noise parameters .",
    "our results show that the two measures display a qualitatively similar behavior , leading to a consistent assessment of non - markovianity .",
    "we also find that environments with a spectrum dominated by low - frequency contribution are generally non - markovian and that the non - markovianity of colored environments is progressively destroyed when the number of fluctuators realizing the environment increases .",
    "these results confirm that non - markovianity may represent a resource for quantum information processing . indeed",
    ", we found that , in dephasing channels , back flow of information corresponds to revivals of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "finally , upon assuming that the channel is reset after each use , we discuss how reliable transmission of information through a noisy quantum channel may be achieved , even in presence of classical non - gaussian noise , for properly engineered structured environments .    in principle",
    ", one could quantify non - markovianity of classical random fields using the definition of non - markovianity for classical stochastic processes , i.e. in terms of the kolmogorov hierarchy of the @xmath5-point joint probability distributions . in turn",
    ", it has been proved @xcite that there are clear differences between the classical and the quantum notion of non - markovianity . in this paper , since we are interested in the _ effects _ of non - markovianity on the quantum information carrier rather than in addressing the fundamental properties of the environment , we have explicitly chosen to assess non - markovianity of classical noise in terms of quantum measures of non - markovianity for the quantum channels induced on qubit systems .",
    "this approach allows us to assess classical environments in terms of their effects on quantum systems and , possibly , engineer their structure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we introduce the blp and bcm measures of non - markovianity . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe in some details the physical model employed throughout the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we show our results on the dynamics of the non - markovianity measures . section [ sec4 ] closes the paper with concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we review two measures of non - markovianity : the blp measure @xcite , based on the trace distance , and the bcm measure , based on the quantum capacity @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea behind the blp measure is that markovian processes tend to reduce the distinguishability between any two states of the open system , while non - markovian processes are characterized by a partial re - growth of distinguishability on at least a subset of states .",
    "the loss of distinguishability is interpreted as an irreversible loss of information on the system while restored distinguishability reflects a partial , and often temporary , increase of information about the system . since the trace distance is related to the probability of successfully distinguishing two quantum states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , it seems natural to use this quantity to describe memory effects and non - markovianity .",
    "the trace distance is defined as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the trace distance defines a metric on the space of density matrices and @xmath10 .",
    "any completely positive and trace preserving map @xmath11 is a contraction for this metric : @xmath12 the flux of information is then defined as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the density matrix of the initial states .",
    "a loss in distinguishability is linked to a negative information flux @xmath15 , while positive flux describes an increasing distinguishability between two quantum states .",
    "the blp measure of non - markovianity quantifies the total amount of information backflow into the system : @xmath16 where the maximization is over all pairs of initial states and the integration is over all time intervals where the flux is positive .",
    "whenever @xmath17 the dynamics is non - markovian .",
    "it is possible to show that all divisible maps are markovian according to this measure , but the converse is not true in general @xcite .",
    "generally , calculating @xmath18 is a difficult task , because of the maximization procedure involved . nevertheless , maximizing pairs",
    "have been found for certain classes of noisy channels , such as the dephasing channel we are going to deal with . as we will review in sec .",
    "iii , indeed , the dephasing dynamics of the qubit is described by the following map @xmath19 i.e. , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the dephasing function . notice that in eq .",
    "dephasing is induced by a classical stochastic process .",
    "it follows that the coefficient @xmath21 is a real quantity that can assume positive and negative values between @xmath22 . for the sake of clarity we notice here the difference between this model and the spin - boson model describing pure dephasing arising from the interaction with a quantum environment @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the dynamics of the coherences is given by @xmath23 $ ] , with @xmath24 , and therefore the dephasing function is always positive .    for a qubit interacting with a classical random field , as in eq .",
    ", the optimal pair in eq . that maximizes the increase of the trace distance has been found @xcite . in the following , we use the name",
    "_ optimal trace distance _ for the expression of the trace distance in eq . computed for the optimal pair .",
    "thus , the study of blp non - markovianity can be reduced to the analysis of the optimal trace distance . in our case",
    "this quantity reads : @xmath25 which is the absolute value of the dephasing function @xmath21 .",
    "once the expression of @xmath26 is known it is possible to write the information flux and then numerically compute the non - markovianity as the integral of the information flux over the time intervals in which it is positive .      the second measure that we will use , introduced by bylicka , chruciski and maniscalco ,",
    "is based on the channel capacities @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", we focus here on the quantum channel capacity as , in our case , it coincides with the entanglement assisted capacity .",
    "generally , the quantum capacity bounds the rate at which quantum information can be reliably transmitted through a noisy quantum channel @xmath11 .",
    "dephasing is a degradable channel and thus the single - use quantum capacity may be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the coherent information : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the von - neumann entropy of the state @xmath31 and @xmath32 the entropy exchange @xcite .",
    "the superior should be taken over all the possible states of the information carrier .",
    "the latter quantity measures the change in the entropy of the environment .",
    "it is worth stressing that , contrarily to trace - distance , the coherent information describes how the entropy of both the system and the environment change .",
    "hence this quantity is more apt to capture the concept of information flow between system and environment .",
    "more explicitly , coherent information is , in fact , quantifying the flow of information between the system and the environment , while the trace distance is quantifying only the _ loss _ of information that we have _ on the system _ without any indication on whether this information is acquired by another agent ( and may come back ) .",
    "the fact that the two measures agree confirms , at least for dephasing channels , that the trace distance may be considered a measure of the flow of information from the system to the environment .    strictly speaking , eq . ( [ qc1 ] ) describes the quantum capacity only for memoryless degradable channels @xcite and thus it seems unsuitable to address quantum channels arising from the interaction with a classical enivironment exhibiting long lasting time correlations .",
    "however , we are interested in the effects of memory _ during the propagation _ of the information carriers , rather than memory effects among subsequent uses of the channel , and thus the expression in ( [ qc1 ] ) fits nicely for our purposes .",
    "of course , memory effects among uses should be eventually addressed in view of realistic implementations .",
    "our results should be considered as a first step toward a complete analysis of this class of channels , including both types of memory effects @xcite .    as a consequence of the quantum data - processing inequality ,",
    "the quantum capacity of divisible channels is a monotonically decreasing function of time .",
    "the bcm measure is therefore based on the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath33 : @xmath34 non - markovianity corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "even if this measure does not explicitly involve a maximization procedure , an optimization is required in the computation of the quantum capacity . in the case of a dephasing channel , however , the analytical expression for @xmath33 is known @xcite : @xmath36 with @xmath37 the shannon binary entropy . as we will see in the following ,",
    "the operational interpretation of the quantum capacity allows us to use @xmath38 to assess if and how non - markovianity can be seen as a resource for quantum communication and information processing .    both the blp and the bcm measure detect consistently non - markovianity in the case of a dephasing channel .",
    "it is easy to show that in both cases the dynamics is non - markovian in the following two regimes : @xmath39 where @xmath21 is the real coefficient appearing in eq .",
    "in order to characterize the non - markovian features of a noisy channel one has to probe its influence on an information carrier . here we focus attention on the simplest quantum probe , i.e. a qubit , and infer the properties of the channel by analyzing the decoherence process induced on the qubit .",
    "we model the classical environment as a random field described by a stochastic process @xmath40 . in order to model the colored noisy channel we do not make the usual assumption of a gaussian process , while we only assume the stationarity property .",
    "let us consider a generic qubit described by the state vector @xmath41 satisfying the condition @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that the evolution of the qubit is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the energy splitting between the two levels of the qubit , @xmath45 is a coupling constant , and @xmath46 is the pauli matrix .",
    "the system - environment interaction of eq . ( [ hamiltonian ] ) describes a non - dissipative dephasing channel , and it is suitable to portray situations where the typical frequencies of the environment are smaller than the natural frequency of the qubit .",
    "different expressions for @xmath40 may be employed , corresponding to different kinds of classical noise . in the next sections",
    ", we briefly review the dynamics of the generic qubit state in environments characterized by rtn and colored noise spectra of the form @xmath47 .",
    "then , in sec",
    ". [ sec3 ] we will employ these results to explicitly evaluate the non - markovianity of the corresponding channels .      random telegraph noise is very common in nature .",
    "it appears in semiconductor , metal and superconducting devices @xcite .",
    "the source of random telegraph noise is a bistable fluctuator , which is a quantity which flips between two values with a switching rate , such as a resistance switching between two discrete values , charges jumping between two different locations or electrons that flip their spin . in order to describe a rtn , the quantity @xmath40 in eq",

    "@xmath101 ( solid black line ) , @xmath103 ( dashed red line ) , @xmath104 ( dotted blue line ) and @xmath124 ( dotdashed green line ) . ]",
    "we conclude this section by addressing the non - markovianity of rtn and colored environments acting independently on two dephasing qubits .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the single qubit hamiltonian in eq .",
    "and @xmath127 is the identity operator in the hilbert space of the first ( second ) qubit .",
    "if we focus on the blp measure , numerical maximization should be performed to find the maximizing initial pair of states . in both the case of rtn and colored noise , the maximizing pair corresponds to the two orthogonal factorized states @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we have numerically confirmed that the optimal trace distance in this case also takes the form : @xmath130 .",
    "the bcm non - markovianity measure is straightforward to calculate as the quantum capacity , it is additive for degradable channels as the one here considered , namely @xmath131 , where the subscript @xmath132 stands for two qubits .",
    "it follows that the non - markovian dynamics of two qubits subjected to independent rtn or coloured noise is simply related to the single - qubit non - markovianity , and therefore it is quantitatively the same .",
    "we have addressed open quantum systems made of one or two qubits interacting with a classical random field and evaluated the non - markovianity of the corresponding noisy maps . in particular , we focused on environments showing non - gaussian fluctuations , as those described by random telegraph noise and colored noise with spectra of the the form @xmath0 . upon analyzing the dynamics of both the trace distance and the quantum or entanglement assisted capacity",
    "we have shown that the behavior of non - markovianity based on both measures is qualitatively similar . besides , we have shown that environments with a spectrum dominated by low - frequency contribution are generally non - markovian , and that non - markovianity of colored environments decreases when the number of fluctuators realizing the environment increases .",
    "overall , our results confirm that non - markovianity may represent a resource for quantum information processing .",
    "in particular , our results show that non - markovian features are indeed connected to the revivals of quantum correlations .",
    "in fact , if we compare our results with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that whenever the environment is non - markovian , revivals of quantum correlations are present , while they decay monotonically for a markovian environment . in other words ,",
    "our results confirm that non - markovianity can not be considered as a mere label to identify different kinds of dynamics .",
    "rather , it may be exploited for a better control of quantum channels , and to better preserve quantum correlations for quantum communication protocols and quantum information processing .",
