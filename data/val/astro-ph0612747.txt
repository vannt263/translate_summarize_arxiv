    "optically - thin accretion flows have been widely studied as a likely origin of the power - law spectral component ( up to @xmath6 100 kev ) in galactic black - hole candidates ( gbhcs ) and nearby low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) , including sgr a * in our galactic center .",
    "thorne & price ( 1975 ) proposed an optically thin accretion model for the first time , and shapiro , lightman , & eardley ( 1976 ; hereafter sle ) modified and applied the model to x - ray observations of cygnus x-1 .",
    "their models were able to explain the observational properties of the low / hard state in gbhcs very well , but the model is thermally unstable ; i.e. the viscous heating rate can not balance the radiative cooling rate so that the sle model is unstable to small - scale perturbations ( see piran 1978 ; kato et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the optically thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model has been investigated extensively since the end of the 1990s ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ; abramowicz et al .",
    "this model has been used to interpret the spectra of black hole x - ray binaries in their quiescent or low / hard state as an alternative to the sle solution .",
    "since adafs have large radial velocities , and the infalling matter carries the thermal energy into the black hole , advective energy transport can stabilize the thermal instability ; thus adaf models have been widely applied to explain observations of galactic black - hole candidates ( e.g. , narayan et al .",

    "1997 ) , the spectral transition of cyg x-1 ( esin et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the multiwavelength spectral properties of sgr a * ( narayan et al . 1995 ; manmoto et al . 1997",
    "; narayan et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , many adaf - like models have been proposed including outflows , or convection , etc . since about 2000 , these models have been united into one category , and began to be called radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) ( igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ; di matteo et al .",

    "the self - similar treatment is a powerful tool for investigating the flow properties under various physical conditions without complex numerical computations , for example , the optically thin advection - dominated regime ( spruit et a. 1987 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) , convection - dominated flows ( narayan et al .",
    "2000 ; abramowicz et al . 2002 ) , the optically thick advection - dominated regime ( wang & zhou 1999 ; watarai & fukue 1999 ; fukue 2000 ) , self - gravity ( mineshige & umemura 1997 ) , the inclusion of magnetic fields ( shadmehri & khajenabi 2005 ; akizuki & fukue 2005 ) , etc . in particular , the self - similar solution ( hereafter sss ) for the adaf shows a good agreement with numerical solutions except at the inner and outer boundaries ( narayan et al .",
    "thus , the self - similar treatment seems to be useful as 0-th order approximations .",
    "to increase the level of approximation in the analytical formulae , one more condition is required .",
    "one of the main problems with the self - similar treatment is the energy equation .",
    "the energy equation in the canonical self - similar solution does not explicitly include radiative cooling , due to the parameterization of @xmath7 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the advective cooling rate and the viscous heating rate , respectively .",
    "almost all self - similar adaf solutions assume that @xmath0=const , so that the radiative cooling is expressed by @xmath8 .",
    "however , @xmath0 should be a function of radius , and other physical parameters when the radiative cooling is comparable to the advective cooling .",
    "moreover if @xmath0 is close to unity , the effect of radiative cooling does not appear in the canonical self - similar solutions .",
    "recently , watarai ( 2006 , hereafter paper 1 ) extended the self - similar solution to the @xmath9const .",
    "regime by including the effect of radiative cooling via @xmath0 in the optically thick advection - dominated solutions using a `` semi - iterative '' method , and the derived analytic formulae agreed well with numerical solutions over a wide range in radius . according to his results ,",
    "@xmath0 is given by the solution of a quadratic equation , and is a function of the mass accretion rate and radius .",
    "this raises the question of whether it is possible to find a variable-@xmath0 solution in the optically - thin case using the same method as in paper 1 .",
    "if we can obtain the variable @xmath0 solution without complex numerical procedures , it will facilitate comparison with observations of the low / hard state of galactic black - hole candidates or low - luminosity agns .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the analytic form of @xmath0 in optically - thin accretion flows and discuss the basic properties of the analytic solutions . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the basic equations and the canonical self - similar solutions .",
    "our new analytic treatment is presented in section 3 . in section 4 , we comment on the transition zone in bimodal accretion flows .",
    "the final section summarizes our results .",
    "we introduce the ratio of the advective cooling rate , @xmath1 , to the viscous heating rate , @xmath2 , @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ) , defined in the same way as in previous papers . as for an optically thin adaf ,",
    "the time scale of energy transport via coulomb interaction between ions and electrons is longer than that of accreting matter . because the density of accreting gas is very low .",
    "thus , such a flow was called an advection - dominated accretion flow , i.e. , @xmath4 , and it becomes a radiatively inefficient throughout the whole of the disk . in this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is not constant , but variable .",
    "first , the canonical self - similar solutions are presented in subsection [ basic ] .",
    "second , using the self - similar solutions , we improve the parameterization of @xmath0 via a semi - iterative procedure described in subsection [ subsec : grobal ] .      in this subsection , we formulate the basic equations , which are the same as those given in paper 1 except for the radiative cooling term ( see also chapter 8 of kato et al .",
    "we assume a steady axisymmetric accretion flow ( @xmath11 ) and a gas pressure - dominated regime .",
    "we solve the following hydrodynamic equations in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) : mass conservation , the momentum equation in the radial direction , angular momentum conservation , hydrostatic balance , and the energy equation , as follows ; @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the mass accretion rate , radial velocity , surface density , @xmath22 , specific angular momentum ( @xmath23 ) , angular momentum at inner edge of the disk , and the scale height , respectively .",

    "such cooling processes are significant near the disk inner region ( inside 10 @xmath56 ) , but rapidly decreases at disk outer region ( roughly @xmath57 ) .",
    "hence we ignore the effect of thermal synchrotron and comptonization in this paper .      to derive the characteristic radial dependence of the above equations , we transform the equations ( [ r - mom ] ) , ( @xmath58 ) , ( [ qvis ] ) , ( [ qadv ] ) as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which can be determined from the self - similar solutions .",

    "the thermal bremsstrahlung cooling depends on the gas density and temperature , so changes in density are implicitly included in @xmath0 via the viscosity parameter @xmath5 .",

    "this method is similar to an iteration procedure : using the sss as a first approximation , we improve the solutions for @xmath0 via the energy equation , which includes the radiative cooling term .",
    "we note that our present solutions have been obtained by the first iteration .",
    "original ssss ( @xmath120 for adaf ) in equation ( [ ss - omega])-([ss - t ] ) are modified by the first iteration ( see figure 1 , 2 ) .",
    "further iteration can expect the improvement of the solutions but the first improvement will be most significant . in other words , our solutions are still quite rough approximation but there is an advantage that is possible to describe in the analytical form .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure / f - alpha.eps    we derived the analytic form of @xmath0 considering the effect of radiative cooling . figure [ fig1 ] shows the solution of @xmath121 and @xmath122 for various values of @xmath5 .",
    "as the values of @xmath5 increase , the optically thin solutions can extend to the disk s outer regions .",
    "the @xmath0 value is close to unity at large radii for high @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 is large , the viscosity effectively extracts the angular momentum of the matter ; thus advective energy transport will be important over a wide range in radius . however , in the outer regions of the disk , radiative losses via bremsstrahlung emission rapidly cool the disk as @xmath5 decreases , so that adaf - like solutions disappear in the disk s outer region .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure / f - mdot.eps    figure [ fig2 ] represents the radial dependence of the mass accretion rate on @xmath0 .",
    "the optically thin solutions depend on the mass accretion rate as well as @xmath5 .",
    "the mass accretion rate generally determines the density , which influences the cooling rate via thermal bremsstrahlung , so that if the density is high , the disk will cool more effectively .",
    "therefore , the two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath115 control the basic properties of these solutions through advective and radiative cooling .    note that figures 1 and 2 have a logarithmic scale on the horizontal axis and a linear scale on the vertical axis .",
    "therefore , the optically thin adaf solutions decrease rapidly at the disk s outer radii",

    "this could be due to the outer boundary conditions for the adaf . to discuss the outer region of the optically thin accretion flow , it is necessary to account for the outer boundary conditions . in some cases",
    "outer boundary conditions can affect the disk structure ( yuan 1999 ; yuan et al .",
    "2000 ) ; we comment on the outer boundary conditions in the next section .",
    "some observations of gbhcs indicate an hot , hard x - ray component and a cold , soft component are coexistent in accretion flow ( thorne & price 1975 , ichimaru 1977 for cyg x-1 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; narayan et al .",
    "1996 for soft x - ray transients ; esin et al .",
    "1997 for nova musca 1991 ; narayan et al .",
    "1997 for v404 cygni ) . to date , two mechanisms have been proposed to explain this hot component : evaporation in the vertical direction of the disk ( meyer & mayer - hofmeister 1994 ) or 2-zone radial geometry which the outer parts of the disk follow the optically thick , while the inner disk switches to the optically thin , hot solution , which is secularly stable ( sle ) .",
    "the 2-zone radial geometry in accretion flow was solved self - consistently for the first time by honma ( 1996 ) , who pointed out the importance of thermal conduction for a smooth transition . with either mechanism , when radiative cooling works efficiently , the hot flow shrinks toward the equatorial plane , and the optically thin accretion flow transitions to the standard disk .",
    "therefore , the energy transport in the radial direction is important for a smooth transition between the optically thin and thick regimes , but it seems that the cooling processes determine the location of the transition radius ; this is an important point .",
    "the location of the transition region between an inner optically thin regime and an outer optically thick regime can be evaluated using equation ( [ eq : adaf ] ) .",
    "if we set @xmath126 as a critical value of advection - dominated accretion , then equation ( [ eq : adaf ] ) has a physical solution ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "then , the transition radius is @xmath127 the parameter dependence of @xmath128 is consistent with the results of honma ( 1996 ) , and is very sensitive to the viscous parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we have used an independent approach to derive this result . note that equation ( [ eq : rtr ] )",
    "represents the radius where the solution disappears , but honma ( 1996 ) obtains the real transition radius .",
    "turbulent thermal conduction in a bimodal accretion flow gives a finite size for the transition zone ( manmoto & kato 2000a , b ) . in the transition zone ,",
    "the heating ( cooling ) via turbulent thermal conduction is balanced by radiative cooling .",
    "turolla & dullemond ( 2000 ) discussed the flow properties at the evaporation radius in the outflow solution by blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) ; however , they treated the transition radius as an input parameter .    recently",
    ", lu et al . ( 2004 ) found bimodal solutions for relatively high values of @xmath5 ( @xmath1290.4 ) without conduction effects .",
    "they performed numerical integration from the sonic point , and then obtained bimodal solutions .",
    "however , their method uses a variety of initial conditions at the sonic point so that the determination of the transition radius is difficult . here",
    "we note that our procedure for evaluating the transition radius is purely mathematical , and the derived transition radius does not depend on the outer boundary conditions .",
    "figure 3 represents the radial structure of a bimodal accretion flow based on our model .",
    "the inner region is described by the optically thin solution , and the outer region is a solution with which the standard optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) is connected by the same accretion rates and @xmath5 parameters as the inner region .",
    "the inner boundary term in the standard model , @xmath130 , was disregarded . here",
    "the @xmath131 represents the disk inner radius .",
    "we ignore radial energy transport between the optically thin regime and the optically thick regime . in our solutions ,",
    "the transition radius is not an input parameter unlike previous studies .",
    "our estimate of the transition radius is very sensitive to the angular frequency , with @xmath132 , and so we can not compare our results with previous papers at this stage .",
    "our model is very simple , so it will be useful for discussing the rough structure of the flow ; however , numerical calculations will be required for detailed comparisons with observations .",
    "this will be carried out in future work .",
    "( 60mm,60mm)figure / sigma.eps ( 60mm,60mm)figure / vr.eps + ( 60mm,60mm)figure / temp.eps ( 60mm,60mm)figure / h.eps      in deriving a solution for optically thin accretion flows , it is necessary to handle the initial value problem with care because the outer boundary conditions can sometimes change the whole structure of the accretion flow .",
    "for example , a keplerian angular frequency at the outer boundary was assumed in several early studies ( narayan et al .",
    "1997 ) but nakamura et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) assumed a sub - keplerian angular momentum and a particular temperature at the outer boundary ( see also chen et al .",
    "1997 ) . in extreme cases",
    ", the outer boundary condition dramatically changes the entire disk structure , for example , when the outer boundary condition is set to high mach number and sub - keplerian angular velocity ( yuan 1999 ; yuan et al .",
    "2000 ) . for this reason ,",
    "it is not meaningful to compare the new analytical solutions with numerical solutions .",
    "we suggest that the plausible outer boundary conditions must be determined from observations of the disk s outer regions in the objects being studied .",
    "the time - dependent evolution of the transition zone , including the effects of turbulent energy transport , was recently computed by gracia et al .",
    "they confirmed the result of manmoto et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , manmoto & kato ( 2000b ) , and found that the transition zone is highly variable , suggesting that it may be the origin of the quasi - periodic oscillations observed in galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "however , if the magnetic field in the transition zone is taken into account , the gas density is confined by the magnetic field , which can cause the cooling energy at a given radius to change and potentially alter the location of the transition radius .",
    "changes in the transition surface due to magnetorotational instability ( mri ) were examined by kato ( 2000 ) using linear analysis .",
    "linear mri perturbations generated in the outer standard disk penetrate into the inner adaf , which results in a highly variable transition zone .",
    "recently , analytic solutions , including magnetic fields , have been investigated extensively by several authors ( meier 2005 ; shadmehri & khajenabi 2005 ; akizuki & fukue 2006 ) . according to machida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the magnetically dominant configuration survives for much longer than the thermal time , and is comparable to the accretion time scale , but it is shorter than the viscous time .",
    "however , such a long time calculation is still rare , so the result has not been reached consensus yet .",
    "we hope to be confirmed for a long time by the simulation a lot near the future .",
    "it is possible that oscillation of the transition surface produces the quasi - periodic oscillations commonly observed in galactic black hole candidates ( see also kato 2000 ) .",
    "this situation is similar to oscillations of the alfvn radius of the magnetosphere around a neutron star ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "thus mhd simulations of the region around the transition surface will be an intriguing topic for further research .",
    "we described analytic formulae for accretion flows in the optically thin regime .",
    "the ratio of the advection cooling rate to the viscous heating rate is given by the solution of a cubic equation , and is a function of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath5 .",
    "solving the cubic equation , we can obtain not only adaf solutions , but also sle - like solutions in a simple way .",
    "our new solutions are physically valid , because both solutions originate from same cooling processes .",
    "the transition radius can be evaluated , where @xmath133 , and is consistent with honma s ( 1996 ) result .",
    "we expect that our analytic technique will be useful for order estimations of optically thin accretion flows ; moreover , it will be useful to provide initial conditions for numerical simulations .",

    "<S> in a previous paper , we described new analytic formulae for optically - thick supercritical accretion flows ( watarai 2006 , hereafter paper 1 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we present analytic formulae for optically - thin one - temperature accretion flows including the advection - dominated regime , using the `` semi - iterative '' method described in paper 1 . </S>",
    "<S> our analytic formulae have two real solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the first solution corresponds to the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , and the second solution corresponds to the radiation - dominated accretion flow described by shapiro , lightman , & eardley ( the so - called sle model ) . </S>",
    "<S> both solutions are given by a cubic equation for the advection parameter @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the advection cooling rate @xmath1 to the viscous heating rate @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> most previous studies assume that @xmath0 is constant ( @xmath4 for the adaf ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that @xmath0 should be a function of the physical parameters of the radiative - cooling dominated regime . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the ratio @xmath0 can be written as a function of the radius , mass accretion rate , and viscous parameter @xmath5 . using this formula </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate the transition radius from the inner optically - thin adaf to the outer optically - thick standard disk , which can be measured using observations of the quiescent state in black hole x - ray binaries . </S>"
