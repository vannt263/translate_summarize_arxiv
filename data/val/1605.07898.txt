    "<S> we report optical second - harmonic generation ( shg ) in reflection from gase crystals of 1 to more than 100 layers using a fundamental picosecond pulsed pump at 1.58 ev and a supercontinuum white light pulsed laser with energies ranging from 0.85 to 1.4 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the measured reflected shg signal is maximal in samples of @xmath020 layers , decreasing in thicker samples as a result of interference . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness- and frequency - dependence of the shg response of samples thicker than @xmath07 layers can be reproduced by a second - order optical susceptibility that is the same as in bulk samples . for samples @xmath17 layers , </S>",
    "<S> the second - order optical susceptibility is reduced compared to that in thicker samples , which is attributed to the expected bandgap increase in mono- and few - layer gase . </S>"
