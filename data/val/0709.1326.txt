    "two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) with an inas or high in - content ga@xmath0in@xmath1as channel layer are very promising candidates for spintronic applications , because they show a strong rashba spin - orbit interaction along with a high electron mobility.@xcite these properties are essential for the realization of various spintronic devices , e.g. , spin field effect transistors , @xcite spin - filters , @xcite or spin - splitters.@xcite the strength of the rashba coupling can be estimated from measurements of shubnikov  de haas oscillations by analyzing the characteristic beating pattern .",
    "@xcite however , the latter can also be evoked by inhomogeneities of the sheet carrier concentration @xcite or due to a slightly occupied second lowest subband;@xcite thus , the observance of a beating pattern is not an unambiguous indication of the presence of spin - orbit coupling . on the other hand",
    ", the weak localization effect is very sensitive not only to an applied magnetic field but also to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the latter results in a non - monotonous dependence of the quantum correction to the conductivity on magnetic field . in case of strong spin - orbit coupling the quantum correction to the conductivity can even change its sign .",
    "the observation of such an effect , also referred to as weak antilocalization ( wal),@xcite is an unambiguous indication of the presence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "thus , weak antilocalization measurements open the way for the experimental determination of the contributions to the spin splitting : the linear and cubic dresselhaus terms,@xcite associated with the lack of crystal inversion symmetry , and the rashba term,@xcite resulting from the structural inversion asymmetry .",
    "the latter can be controlled by applying an external electric field and is thus in particular interesting for spintronic devices.@xcite    until recently , only theoretical models describing the weak spin precession regime , also called `` diffusion '' regime , were available,@xcite where the elastic mean free path @xmath2 is much shorter than the spin precession length @xmath3.@xcite however , @xmath4 is often found in high mobility 2degs comprising a strong spin - orbit interaction . under such conditions",
    "an experimental observation of the weak antilocalization requires very sensitive magnetotransport measurements , since the width of the wal peak is often less than 1  mt . from theoretical point of view ,",
    "extensions of the `` diffusion '' models to the case of strong spin precession were only limited to an even narrower range of magnetic fields and thus do not describe the whole wal curve.@xcite very recently , this problem was solved by the model developed by golub@xcite and later extended by glazov and golub,@xcite which is valid for both the weak and strong spin precession regimes in 2degs .    taking this into account",
    ", we have utilized this model to extract the spin - orbit coupling in high - mobility gainas / inp samples . by fitting the wal curves at different gate voltages we obtained the dependence of the rashba spin - orbit coupling parameter on the sheet carrier concentration .",
    "the results of these measurements were compared with the values extracted from the analysis of the beating pattern of the shubnikov  de haas oscillations .",
    "we found , that despite of the fact that the fitting procedure is time - consuming due to the numerical complexity , the weak antilocalization measurements might be more advantageous for the determination of the rashba coupling parameter , since they are also applicable if no beating pattern of the shubnikov  de haas oscillations can be observed , e.g. in case of low mobility .",

    "metallic top gates separated from the semiconductor surface by an insulating hsq layer ( hydrogen silsesquioxane ) covered the complete hall bar structure and allowed us to control the sheet carrier concentration @xmath10 in a wide range , even down to a complete depletion of the 2deg .",
    "the magnetotransport measurements were performed in a @xmath11he - cryostat with a superconducting magnet at temperatures down to 0.4  k utilizing a lock - in technique .",
    "since the wal effect is strongly temperature dependent , special attention was payed to the electrical power dissipated in the 2deg .",

    "this ratio becomes even less .",
    "the cubic dresselhaus term , which is dependent strongly on @xmath21 , at zero gate voltage is comparable with the linear one and decreases rapidly with reduced @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in our sample the spin - orbit coupling is dominated by the rashba effect . by varying",
    "the built - in electrical field and , consequently , the bending of the conductance and valence band profile the magnitude of the rashba coupling parameter can be controlled .    in 2degs",
    ", the rashba spin - orbit coupling parameter @xmath18 can be determined from the position of the nodes of the beating pattern in the shubnikov  de haas oscillations:@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath21 is the fermi wave vector , @xmath23 is the effective electron mass , and @xmath24 is the magnetic field where the @xmath25th node is observed .",
    "the values of the spin - orbit coupling parameter determined by this method are presented in fig .",
    "[ alpha_vs_n2d ] .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath18 increases with decreasing @xmath10 because of the larger asymmetry of the quantum well profile at more negative gate voltages . as the sheet carrier concentration becomes smaller than 2@xmath26  @xmath15 , the second node ( see fig .  [ rxx_mu ] ) can not be resolved anymore and , consequently , one faces the limitations of the beating pattern analysis technique for the extraction of the rashba parameter . with the known values of @xmath18",

    "[ wal - gated ] , a clear weak antilocalization peak was resolved at @xmath28 for gate voltages @xmath12 ranging from -3.0 to -5.9  v. here , the magnitude of the quantum conductance correction was obtained by subtracting the conductance at zero magnetic field from the experimental determined magnetoconductance . increasing the gate voltage resulted in a strong increase of the sample resistance and simultaneously in a broadening of the wal peak . under such conditions , the experimental observation of the wal effect becomes easier , compared to resolving the beating pattern of the shubnikov  de haas oscillations , in particular at the highest gate voltages . at @xmath29",
    "v the wal effect could not be resolved unambiguously .",
    "( color online ) quantum conductivity correction curves measured at different gate voltages ( dots ) .",
    "the curves are vertically shifted for clarity .",
    "solid lines represent the fit by a model in refs .  [ ] ]    in order to extract the rashba coupling parameter from the weak antilocalization measurements the experimental curves were fitted by numerically calculated ones .",
    "the choice of the proper model is governed by the transport regime in the sample . in our case , a comparison of the elastic mean free path @xmath2 and the spin relaxation length @xmath3 extracted from the findings of the shubnikov  de haas oscillations revealed that @xmath2 is larger than @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to the regime of strong spin precession , so that the model in refs .",
    "[ ] has to be applied .",
    "it has been shown that the calculated weak antilocalization curves do not differ from each other significantly if the ratio between the coupling parameters @xmath30 and @xmath18 is less than approximately 0.6.@xcite since in our case the ratio is less than 0.24 , we can readily neglect the dresselhaus terms in the further analysis .",
    "at a given electron concentration , the number of free fitting parameters in the simulations could be reduced from four to two , since the elastic mean free path @xmath2 and the elastic scattering time @xmath31 were determined directly from the shubnikov  de haas measurements and were kept constant during the fitting procedure . the initial value of one of the free parameters , the phase coherence length @xmath32 , was estimated according to refs .  [ ] and adjusted during the fitting procedure . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ wal - gated ] , a good fit to the experimental curves has been achieved for all gate voltages .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath18 are shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha_vs_n2d ] .",
    "knowing the fitting parameters in particular the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath10 , the corresponding dependence of the spin precession length @xmath3 was determined [ see fig .",
    "[ lso ]  a ) ] .",
    "high electron concentrations , i.e. small negative gate voltages , result in @xmath3 which is an order of magnitude shorter than @xmath2 . applying higher negative gate voltages , i.e. lowering @xmath10 , leads to the rapid shortening of the @xmath2 and , due to the enhancement of the spin - orbit interaction , to the shortening of @xmath3 . despite the decrease of @xmath2 with @xmath10 , @xmath2 is always larger than the corresponding value of @xmath3 .",

    "a comparison of the values of @xmath18 obtained by the analysis of the beating pattern with the ones determined from the wal measurements reveals a good agreement , although the latter are slightly higher .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not clear , yet .",
    "possibly , the inaccuracy in the determination of the minimum position of the wal curve caused by the additional contribution of other magnetotransport effects results in an overestimation of the rashba coupling parameter .",
    "as long as the spin - orbit interaction is the only cause of the beatings in the shubnikov  de haas oscillations , these two methods are complementary in a certain range of carrier densities . however , at high carrier densities the observation of wal is more difficult , since the longitudinal resistance of the sample and consequently the signal - to - noise ratio drops rapidly , whereas the characteristic beating pattern in the shubnikov  de haas oscillations can be resolved easily .",
    "in contrast , at low electron concentrations the wal peak can be easily measured , whereas the position of the nodes can not be resolved anymore .",
    "temperature dependent measurements , presented in fig .  [ wal - temp ]  a ) for a gate voltage of @xmath37  v , show a fast suppression of the wal peak with increasing temperature .",
    "also here , a good agreement between the experiment and the model of glazov and golub@xcite can be readily seen .",

    "[ wal - temp ]  b ) ] .    at low temperatures",
    "the phase breaking rate @xmath33 is essentially determined by electron - electron scattering , which can be divided into two contributions .",
    "the first one , being connected to a large - energy - transfer scattering mechanism , leads to a @xmath35-dependence of @xmath36 and is dominant at @xmath39.@xcite the second contribution originating from a small - energy - transfer mechanism depends linearly on @xmath34 and is most significant at @xmath40.@xcite as can be seen in fig .",

    "[ wal - temp]b ) ] confirms that at higher temperatures ( @xmath41  k ) large - energy - transfer scattering with @xmath42 dominates .",
    "whereas , at lower temperatures a deviation from a slope proportional to @xmath35 towards a linear temperature dependence is observed , in particular at @xmath43  v. in fact , at increasing negative gate voltages a shift of the crossover temperature @xmath44 towards larger values is expected , owing to the decrease of @xmath31 with decreasing electron concentration . in detail , at gate voltages of @xmath37  v , @xmath45  v , and @xmath46  v the cross - over temperature was determined to be 5.4  k , 3.9  k , and 2.4  k , respectively . in accordance with the theoretical prediction @xcite an increased scattering rate @xmath36",
    "is found for larger negative gate voltages , i.e. lower @xmath10 and lower @xmath31 .",
    "however , a direct comparison of the values of @xmath36 extracted from the fit to the golub model@xcite with the theoretically determined values@xcite reveals , that the latter is larger by a factor of about two . probably , this discrepancy is connected to uncertainties in the determination of @xmath47 at large negative gate voltages , which is caused by the weak dependency of the quantum conduction correction on @xmath47 . as we observed in our calculations",
    ", @xmath47 has a strong effect on the magnitude of the quantum correction at magnetic fields smaller then 0.1  mt , i.e. close to the resolution limit of the experiment .",
    "in addition , inaccuracies in the determination of @xmath2 and @xmath31 from the shubnikov  de haas oscillations become more pronounced at large negative gate voltages . in our simulations we found that these inaccuracies mainly affect the precision in the determination of @xmath47 .",
