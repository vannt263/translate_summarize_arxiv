    "systematic surveys of the milky way surroundings with ccd photometry such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system  1 ( pan - starrs1 or ps1 ) , and the dark energy survey ( des ) have allowed for the discovery of numerous faint milky way satellites in the last decade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite sometimes reaching total luminosities of only @xmath9 @xcite , a significant fraction of these new discoveries are confirmed to be dynamically hotter than implied by their baryonic content alone and are thought to be the most dark - matter dominated dwarf galaxies to orbit the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such systems are particularly valuable to both understand the faint - end of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hunt for dark matter annihilation signals as their properties are not expected to be strongly impacted by baryonic processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , without spectroscopic observations , assessing the nature of such stellar systems is rendered difficult by the apparent merging of the globular cluster and dwarf galaxy realms at the faint end .",
    "although this effect is likely due in part to surface brightness limits in the current searches that translate to only faint and small stellar systems being bright enough to overcome detection limits @xcite , it remains that disentangling currently observed globular clusters from dwarf galaxies can be challenging .",
    "two such examples , draco  ii ( dra  ii ) and sagittarius  ii , are shown in our recent presentation of three faint systems found in the ps1 @xmath2 survey @xcite . with a total magnitude of @xmath0 ( or @xmath10 ) and a half - light radius of only @xmath1 ,",
    "dra  ii is a system whose properties are similar to those of the dwarf galaxy segue  1 @xcite , but whose size is smaller than any confirmed dwarf galaxy .    in this letter , we analyze the first spectroscopic observations of dra  ii with the deimos multi - object spectrograph on keck  ii @xcite .",
    "the measured velocities confirm that dra  ii is a milky way satellite and show a marginally resolved velocity dispersion .",
    "the metallicity properties of the system further hint that dra  ii is likely a dwarf galaxy .",
    "we present our observations and data in section  2 , perform the analysis of the data set in section  3 , and conclude in section  4 .",
    "one deimos mask was observed on the night of july 17 , 2015 , placed close to the center of dra  ii in such a way to optimise the number of high - priority bright candidate members .",
    "the priorities were set as both a function of spatial location ( higher priority towards the center of the system ) and location in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "all targets are selected using the ps1 photometry and higher priorities are given to potential main - sequence ( ms ) , main - sequence turn off ( msto ) and red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars selected to follow an isochrone that best reproduces the cmd features of dra  ii .",
    "the mask was drilled with @xmath11 slits .",
    "observations were taken following our usual routine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a total of 3,600s , split into three 1,200s sub - exposures , under good conditions ( 50% humidity , @xmath11 seeing ) .",
    "we further observed nearkrxe calibrations through the slit mask after the science frames at the same location on sky .",
    "the chosen grating has 1200  lines / mm and covers the wavelength range 66009400 , with a spectral resolution of @xmath12  per pixel .",
    "we process the raw spectra through our own pipeline that we developed over the years to specifically handle deimos data .",
    "the details of the pipeline , which focuses on the calcium triplet region , are given by @xcite , to which we add another calibration step using the fraunhofer a band in the range 75957630  in order to perform small telluric corrections @xcite .",
    "the signal to noise per pixel ( s / n ) of the reduced spectra in the ca triplet region is typical 30/8 at @xmath13 .    for a cold stellar system like dra  ii",
    ", it is particularly important to assess the level of systematics on the measured velocity uncertainties .",
    "deimos is known to yield a small level of systematics that can not be entirely explained from properly tracking the sources of noise in the spectra .",
    "these systematics are likely due to minute misalignments of stars in the slits and can only be constrained through repeat measurements of observations and/or a comparison with reference radial velocities .",
    "@xcite conducted such a comparison for high signal - to - noise deimos spectra of the ngc  2419 globular cluster , observed under very similar conditions ( @xmath11 slits and @xmath14 seeing ) and processed through our pipeline .",
    "the comparison was made with more accurate hires observations of 7 stars and yielded an uncertainty floor of @xmath15 , which we add in quadrature to the velocity uncertainties measured from the spectra .",
    "after culling stars with low signal - to - noise ( @xmath16 per pixel ) and velocity uncertainties higher than @xmath17 , we converge on a final sample of 34 stars with good radial velocity measurements .",
    "the properties of the 9 dra  ii member stars ( see below ) are listed in table  1 and the properties of field stars are available online .    all velocities given in this letter are heliocentric radial velocities , except when indicated otherwise .

    "already , one can note a sub - sample of stars that track the cmd features of dra  ii at large negative velocities .",
    "this is confirmed by the velocity distribution of the whole sample , presented in the top panel of figure  [ velfit ] , that clearly exhibits a cold velocity peak near @xmath23 , within the expected range for a milky way satellite .",
    "the 9 stars that compose the velocity peak are those overlaid in dark blue in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "all 9 stars are quite faint and belong to the stellar system s ms , msto , or low rgb .",
    "the isochrone of an old ( @xmath19 ) and metal - poor ( @xmath20 ) stellar population at the distance of dra  ii ( @xmath24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is shown for comparison .    despite our selection of a large number of potential ( brighter ) rgb stars",
    ", we did not uncover a single star with @xmath25 in dra  ii . on the other hand ,",
    "the member stars are , as expected , located towards the center of the system .",
    "all but one member star lie in the ellipse delimiting the region within @xmath22 .",
    "we fit the velocity distribution by a model composed of the sum of 2 gaussian functions representing the dra  ii signal and the mw foreground contamination . following the probabilistic framework presented in @xcite , which takes the individual velocity uncertainties into account , yields the dra  ii systemic velocity , @xmath3 or @xmath26 , and its velocity dispersion , @xmath4 , with a 95% confidence limit of @xmath27 .",
    "the probability distribution functions are also shown in figure  [ velfit ] for these two parameters .",
    "the set of parameters that maximises the likelihood function is used to build the velocity model , which can be seen in the top panel of the figure after convolution by the median uncertainty .",
    "it compares very favourably with the velocity distribution .",
    "one may question the membership of the faintest star in the sample , star 25 , as it is rather red compared to the isochrone shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "it happens to also be the outermost star with a high membership probability , appearing as the only dark blue data point beyond the @xmath22 ellipse in the right - hand panel of figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "however , the faint magnitude of this star translates into a large velocity uncertainty ( @xmath28 ) and , consequently , keeping or removing it from the sample of members does not impact the inference on the velocity properties of dra  ii .     probability distribution functions of the dynamical mass of dra  ii within its 3-dimensional half - light radius ( @xmath29 ; left ) and of its mass - to - light ratio within the same radius ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the gray dashed lines indicate the mode of the distributions . ]",
    "although our contraints on the velocity dispersion are weak , it is marginally resolved and close to values measured for faint mw dwarf galaxies such as segue  1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath31 ) .",
    "using equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , we can estimate the mass within the 3-dimensional half - light radius , @xmath29 , via the half - light radius @xmath32 : @xmath33 .",
    "randomly drawing values from the pdfs of @xmath34 from above and @xmath32 from @xcite yields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in solar units ( figure  [ m_ml ] ) .",
    "if dra  ii were a stellar system in equilibrium and binaries had no impact , one would expect a velocity dispersion of order @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , even though we can not rule out that the large dynamical mass we measure could be a statistical fluctuation , we find marginal evidence that dra  ii is hotter than would be implied solely by its baryonic content , hinting that it could be a dark - matter dominated dwarf galaxy .",
    "however , more velocities are required to strengthen the velocity dispersion measurement and , in particular , assess the impact of binary stars @xcite .    unrelated to dra  ii member stars ,",
    "we note in passing that the distribution of mw foreground contaminants tends to favour negative velocities .",
    "in particular , 2 stars have velocities below @xmath36 , which is quite unexpected ( a @xmath37 deviation from expectations ) and could point towards the presence of halo stellar substructure along this line of sight .",
    "comparison of the spectrum of a faint rgb star from ngc  2419 ( top ) , taken from the @xcite sample , with the spectra of the 4 dra  ii member stars with the highest @xmath38 ( bottom four panels ) .",
    "the spectra are smoothed with a 3-pixel boxcar kernel .",
    "the wavelength coverage shown includes the ca triplet lines , clearly visible in the spectrum of the ngc  2419 star and weaker in star  2 of the dra  ii .",
    "these three strong lines are almost buried in the noise of the other 3 spectra .",
    "stars  2 and 10 display different line depths , despite having similar colours and magnitudes , implying a metallicity dispersion in the system . ]",
    "the absence of bright rgb stars amongst the 9 dra  ii member stars limits our ability to accurately measure the metallicity of the system .",
    "however , we note that the high s / n member stars exhibit particularly weak ca triplet lines , which implies a very low @xmath39 metallicity . in figure",
    "[ spectra ] , we compare the spectra of dra  ii member stars 2 , 10 , 4 , and 5 ( the 4 stars with the highest @xmath38 ) with the spectrum of a star that belongs to ngc  2419 ( @xmath40 ; @xcite ) , observed by @xcite with the same instrumental set up .",
    "the brightest 4 dra  ii member stars all show weaker lines than the metal - poor ngc  2419 .",
    "in fact , the ca triplet lines of stars  10 , 4 , and 5 are barely distinguishable from the noise in the spectra , despite @xmath41 .    at this stage ,",
    "a word of caution is necessary as the ngc  2419 star is significantly brighter ( @xmath42 ) than the dra  ii stars ( @xmath43 ) . as such , it is expected that the cat lines of the dra  ii stars should be less pronounced for the same overall metallicity .",
    "in addition , the @xcite relation between the equivalent widths of theses lines and the metallicity of their stars has not been calibrated fainter than the horizontal branch ( @xmath44 ) so we are loath to blindly use this relation to quote @xmath39 values for these stars",
    ". however , @xcite have demonstrated in the case of the metal - poor globular cluster ngc  7078 that the @xcite relation is consistent with observations down to at least @xmath45 magnitudes below the horizontal branch .",
    "figure  1 of the leaman et al .",
    "paper shows that the cat equivalent width difference between the metal - poor ngc  2419 star ( @xmath46 ) and star 2 from dra  ii ( @xmath47 ) is driven mainly by the change of @xmath48 along the rgb and that this star is consequently as metal - poor as ngc  2419 .",
    "it further implies that star  10 , with a cat equivalent width of only @xmath49 is significantly more metal - poor than ngc  2419 .",
    "furthermore , the stark difference between the spectra of stars  2 and 10 , which must have very similar stellar parameters as they are confirmed dra  ii member stars with almost identical colours and magnitudes ( ( 0.53,18.87 ) and ( 0.55,18.98 ) ) , implies that these two member stars have significantly different metallicities ( a @xmath50 difference in the equivalent width measurements ) .",
    "therefore , we are left to conclude that dra  ii is not only a metal - poor system , but also has a metallicity dispersion .",
    "going further and estimating tentative metallicity values for stars 2 and 10 via equation ( a.1 ) of @xcite for i - band magnitudes via the @xcite colour equations ] yields @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , in good agreement with the conclusions of the comparison with the ngc  2419 star .",
    "taking the dwarf galaxy luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation of @xcite at face value , one would expect @xmath53 for a system of dra  ii s overall luminosity , which is compatible with our findings .",
    "in addition , only dwarf galaxies exhibit metallicity dispersions at these magnitudes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the low metallicity and the metallicity dispersion implied by our analysis lead us to conclude that , independently of the kinematics , dra  ii is likely a dwarf galaxy and not a globular cluster .",
    "in this letter , we performed a first spectroscopic study of the dra  ii stellar system recently discovered in the ps1 @xmath2 survey , which establishes some of its basic properties :    1 .",
    "a systemic velocity of @xmath54 confirms it is indeed a satellite of the milky way .",
    "the inferred velocity dispersion of dra  ii is @xmath55 .",
    "combined with the size of the system , it implies a mass - to - light ratio within the 3-dimensional half - light radius , @xmath56 , that is hard to reconcile with a baryonic system in equilibirum .",
    "the calcium triplet lines of dra  ii member stars imply that the system is more metal - poor than the ngc  2419 globular cluster , i.e. @xmath8 . the quasi - absence of cat lines in some of the member stars implies that the systematic metallicity of the system could be significantly more metal - poor than this , as expected from the dwarf galaxies luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation .",
    "4 .   two dra  ii member stars with similar colours and magnitudes have significantly different equivalent widths ( a @xmath50 difference ) , which implies a metallicity dispersion in dra  ii .",
    "no @xmath39 dispersion has ever been observed in low - luminosity globular clusters , but is commonly observed in dwarf galaxies .",
    "none of the above measurements or arguments by itself can discriminate whether dra  ii is a star cluster or a dwarf galaxy .",
    "taken together , however , these measurements favour on balance the interpretation that this system is amongst the faintest , most compact , and closest dwarf galaxies ( @xmath1 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ) and a target of choice for both the study of the faint end of galaxy formation and for searches of indirect dark - matter detections .",
