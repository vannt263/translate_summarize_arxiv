    "this speculation seems to be consistent with the fact that the magnitude of the fm components shows a large sample dependence when compared with the previous reports . as described above , however",
    ", no detectable sign of impurities or second phases has been observed in the present xrd or edx measurements .",
    "furthermore , it is quite unlikely that a typical ferromagnetic impurity has such a huge coercive field and semi - uniaxial anisotropy in which most of the fm component aligned along the [ 001 ] direction . considering all these clues together , the emergence of the 50@xmath72k - fm component seems to be an independent phenomena from bulk properties of uau@xmath0si@xmath0 , but not just impurities or second phases .",
    "hence we can make one hypothesis that it originates from a portion of uranium ions whose circumstances are somehow different from those of the majority of uranium ions which cause the order at @xmath20 .",
    "this invokes the case of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , where an afm transition occurs by applying uniaxial stress @xcite .",
    "this afm phase is known to exist at ambient pressure with a small volume fraction , as a metastable state under the majority phase of this system , called hidden order .",
    "it is considered that such a competition of magnetic ordering can be driven by a tiny change in the lattice parameters , which is hardly detected by usual x - ray diffraction techniques .",
    "it is also known that some crystals of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibit unusual fm behavior with three different onset temperatures @xcite .",
    "another example in the uranium 1 - 2 - 2 system would be uni@xmath0ge@xmath0 , whose magnetization shows fm anomalies with a large uniaxial anisotropy , without any anomalies in other bulk properties @xcite . in order to clarify the origin of the 50 k - fm component , further investigation of sample dependence and measurements of other physical properties , particularly microscopic techniques such as neutron diffraction , @xmath73sr , and nmr are necessary .",
    "as we have presented above , the magnetic moments in uau@xmath0si@xmath0 are likely to order antiferromagnetically , rather than ferromagnetically below @xmath1 . then what is the origin of the fm component observed along the [ 001 ] axis in the ordered state ?",
    "we consider a case that an uncompensated afm ( uafm ) order is realized .",
    "m - h _ curve along the [ 001 ] direction in the ordered state can be regarded as the sum of the fm component with saturated magnetization and a component which is increasing linearly with the magnetic field expressed by the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath75 , respectively , as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion-50k ] .",
    "this fm component can be explained by uncompensated magnetic moments along the [ 001 ] axis , based on the uafm order model of localized u magnetic moments .    this uafm order with a ferromagnetic component also gives a rough sketch of the temperature dependence of magnetization along [ 001 ] , @xmath76 .",
    "the cusp anomaly , which emerges in higher fields above 5 t , can be well accounted for by staggered components of the afm configuration of magnetic moments .",
    "the absence of the cusp in the lower magnetic fields may be because the upturn of the fm component conceals the subtle cusp .",
    "to see this we assumed the upturn below @xmath1behaves similarly to the temperature dependence of @xmath62 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ m_vs_t_field_subtract ] , and then subtracted it from @xmath76 .",
    "the subtracted @xmath76 , displayed by dashed lines in the upper panel of fig . [ m_vs_t_field_subtract ] , shows a much larger suppression below @xmath1than that of @xmath77 displayed by open circles .",
    "this indicates that there are larger staggered components of magnetic moments along the [ 001 ] axis rather than along the [ 100 ] axis .",
    "hence this analysis suggests the uafm order whose ordered magnetic moments are likely to be along the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "although this simple local - moment model successfully explains several key features of the magnetization , it is still insufficient for the actual system , because it can not account for the component increasing in the magnetic field . we can consider that it reflects magnetic - field induced changes of a possible noncollinear magnetic structure leading to increasing projection of the u magnetic moment on the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "the noncollinear magnetic structure is also conceivable with the observed increase of the @xmath19@xmath27[100 ] resistivity below @xmath1 , which indicates opening a gap on the fermi surface due to af components developing within the basal plane .",
    "for example , one may consider a cone / umbrella or spiral magnetic structure having the [ 001 ] symmetry axis , with which the observed field - induced increase of the [ 001 ] magnetization may be accounted for by the gradual closing of the moments angle towards [ 001 ] .",
    "in addition to it , we can also consider the possibility of paramagnetic components due to the van - vleck paramagnetism and/or the enhanced pauli paramagnetism .",
    "particularly the @xmath49-anomaly in high magnetic fields characterized by the gradual change of slope indicates existence of noncollinear component in the magnetic structure .",
    "it may be also supported by the moderate anisotropy of the effective moments .",
    "consequently the ground state of uau@xmath0si@xmath0 is more likely to be complex and/or noncollinear afm order , not fm order like previously reported .",
    "si@xmath0 in magnetic fields of 2 t , 4 t , 6 t , and 7 t , applied along the [ 001 ] , @xmath78 , ( closed circles ) and [ 100 ] , @xmath79 , ( open circles ) axes .",
    "the dashed lines are remaining magnetization after subtraction of the assumed fm component , which is shown in the lower panel .",
    "( lower panel ) the temperature dependence of the fm component associated with the phase transition at @xmath20 , assumed to follow that of @xmath62 , which is obtained by the curve fitting using eq .",
    "( [ eq_2hysteresis]).,width=321 ]    uafm orderings with fm components have been found in several u@xmath6si@xmath0 relatives .",
    "uni@xmath0si@xmath0 is considered to show such an uafm order with @xmath80 below 53 k in zero field @xcite .",
    "upd@xmath0si@xmath0 is known to order in the same magnetic structure in a phase which appears at temperature below @xmath4 120 k and in magnetic field above @xmath4 0.7 t @xcite .",
    "uru@xmath0si@xmath0 also has a phase in magnetic field where an uafm ordering is realized .",
    "the recent neutron diffraction experiment in high magnetic field revealed that the propagating vector is _ q _",
    "= ( 2/3 , 0 , 0 ) @xcite .",
    "all of these orders are collinear orders where the magnetic moments are parallel to [ 001 ]",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the low - temperature electronic state of uau@xmath0si@xmath0 with these compounds .",
    "here we have assumed the local moment model , but of course we can consider the possibility of an order of itinerant electrons , such as the spin - density wave .",
    "in fact , the upturn anomaly at @xmath1 in the resistivity resembles the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) transition , the so - called `` cr - like behavior '' with a commonly accepted scenario that an additional gap open on the fermi surface caused by sdw forming .",
    "this kind of behavior of resistivity was observed also for uni@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite , uco@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , and uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "future calculations of the band structure are necessary to clarify this point .      here , we discuss the 5f electron properties in uau@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "we observed moderate anisotropy in the paramagnetic state ( @xmath81 = 49 k ) and the magnetic entropy that reaches @xmath82ln6 at room temperature .",
    "this is in remarkable contrast with the fact that not a few u@xmath6si@xmath0 compounds exhibit much stronger uniaxial magnetic anisotropy .",
    "uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , upd@xmath0si@xmath0 , and ucr@xmath0si@xmath0 are such the typical examples , in which the [ 001 ] axis is the easy axis , and the [ 100 ] axis magnetic susceptibility shows very weak temperature variations @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the magnetic entropy at room temperature is relatively large , when compared with , the estimation of @xmath83 or @xmath84 of the ising system uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the other u@xmath6si@xmath0 compounds exhibiting magnetic ordering ( except for ucu@xmath0si@xmath0 ) also show similar very strong uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy in paramagnetic state .",
    "there are two principal microscopic mechanisms of magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the first one is the crystalline electric field ( cef ) interaction , which is the single - ion mechanism born in the electrostatic interaction between the anisotropic crystalline electric field ( potential created at the magnetic ion site by the electric charge distribution in the rest of the crystal ) and the aspherical charge cloud of the magnetic electrons .",
    "the single - ion anisotropy is most often encountered in compounds based on rare - earth elements , which have well - localized 4f - electron states @xcite .",
    "the second one is the hybridization effect between magnetic electrons and surrounding ligand electrons .",
    "the 5f wave functions of uranium are considerably extended in space .",
    "consequently the 5f - electron states hybridize with ligand valence - electron states ( 5f - ligand hybridization @xcite ) .",
    "the strong interaction of the u 5f orbitals with surrounding ligands in the crystal caused by their large space extension implies an essentially different mechanism of magnetocrystalline anisotropy based on a two ion ( u - u ) interaction .",
    "a relatively simple model which leads to qualitatively realistic results has been worked out by cooper and co - workers @xcite on the basis of coqblin - schrieffer approach to the mixing of ionic f - states and conduction - electron states @xcite .",
    "the theory has been further extended so that each partially delocalized f - electron ion is coupled by anisotropic two - ion interaction giving anisotropic magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "one important factor which directly correlates with the 5f - ligand hybridization is the distance between the f - ions and the non - f ligands , which can be tuned by the lattice parameters : the _ a _ and _ c _ parameters in the case of the tetragonal structure .",
    "the smaller distance makes the hybridization stronger .",
    "another factor is the number of d - electrons of the transition - metal ions .",
    "it is commonly believed that the increase of the d - band filling weakens the d - f hybridization , because the energy of d - band is considered to be pulled down away from the fermi level by increasing the filling , resulting in the less overlap of the d and f bands @xcite .",
    "since uau@xmath0si@xmath0 has the largest lattice parameter of @xmath85 @xmath86 10.3   and the largest d - band filling in the 5d systems of u@xmath6si@xmath0 , the weakest 5f - d hybridization within the u@xmath6si@xmath0 compounds can be expected .",
    "this consideration is consistent with the present results just mentioned above .",
    "note that ucu@xmath0si@xmath0 , which is characterized by the highest d - band filling of the 3d transition metals leading to the minimized 5f-3d hybridization @xcite and exhibits large magnetic entropy at room temperature of @xmath82ln9 @xcite , represents a somewhat intermediate case ( @xmath87 @xmath4 180 k ) between the moderate anisotropy in uau@xmath0si@xmath0 and the very strong anisotropy of other u@xmath6si@xmath0 compounds having a magnetically ordered ground state .",
    "the fact that uau@xmath0si@xmath0 and ucu@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibit moderate anisotropy is considered to be due to a dramatically reduced energy scale of the two - ion interaction reflecting the minimized 5f - d hybridization as a consequence of their large lattice parameters and characteristics of high d - band filling .",
    "a local character of the 5f electrons in uau@xmath0si@xmath0 can be deduced from the magnetic susceptibility , which follows the curie - weiss s law at high temperatures above @xmath460 k. moreover , the resistivity shows roughly the -ln@xmath14 behavior from room temperature down to @xmath86 60 k. if this is due to the kondo effect , this also means existence of local 5f electron magnetic moments . on the other hand , at lower temperature the 5f electrons behave like itinerant electrons , as seen in the large @xmath88 and @xmath24 values , with which we can put uau@xmath0si@xmath0 on the kadowaki - woods plot for the typical heavy fermion compounds , @xmath89 .",
    "although these values should be interpreted carefully , because they are deduced from the data from the magnetically ordered state , these experimental facts strongly suggest that the low - temperature state of this compound is described by the fermi - liquid theory with heavy 5f itinerant electrons .",
    "we have succeeded in growing a single - crystalline sample of a uranium intermetallic compound uau@xmath0si@xmath0 for the first time , and made a characterization of it through measurements of specific heat , electrical resistivity and magnetization . we have confirmed that a second - order phase transition occurs at 19 k , with a spontaneous magnetization only along [ 001 ] direction .",
    "this order is considered to be spin - uncompensated and/or noncollinear afm order , not fm order as believed in the previous reports .",
    "the magnetic field - temperature phase diagram with the applied field along the [ 001 ] direction suggests an existence of another magnetically ordered phase in magnetic fields above @xmath4 6 t ; uau@xmath0si@xmath0 might have multiple magnetic phases with different magnetic structures like some of other 1 - 2 - 2 relatives such as upd@xmath0si@xmath0 and uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the weak one - ion magnetic anisotropy in the paramagnetic range and the large magnetic entropy at room temperature have been revealed .",
    "these experimental facts suggest that the relatively low energy of the 5f - ligand hybridization as well as the cef effects induces the interaction responsible for the magnetic anisotropy in uau@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "this is a vivid contrast to the cases of most other u@xmath6si@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the origin of weak fm component arising at about 50 k is still an open issue .",
    "its peculiar properties , such as semi - uniaxial anisotropy along the crystalline [ 001]-axis and the giant coercive field , imply that it is not just an impurity or second phase contribution .",
    "meanwhile , the absence of the specific - heat anomaly and separability of the magnetization curve suggests that it is independent phenomena from the bulk phase transition at 19 k. this incompatibility should be resolved through more detailed experiments in future .",
    "the improvement of the quality of the single - crystalline samples and microscopic experiments to determine the magnetic structure will shed light on the nature of the peculiar magnetism of uau@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
