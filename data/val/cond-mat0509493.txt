    "when a collection of macroscopic grains ( diameter ranging from @xmath5 cm up to @xmath6 cm ) is vigorously shaken , under appropriate conditions of packing fraction , amplitude and frequency of the vibration , a stationary gaseous state , usually referred to as `` granular gas '' , can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "kinetic energy is dissipated into heat during collisions among grains , and this energetic loss is balanced by the external driving , i.e. the shaking of the container . in recent years",
    "the interest on granular gases has strongly increased : it has been shown that the whole machinery of kinetic theory can be applied on simplified but realistic models , leading to theoretical results in good agreement with experiments  @xcite . at the same time",
    "a growingly rich phenomenology has emerged from the laboratory , showing that a granular gas is a sort of pandora s box for non equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "just to mention the most famous and well established aspects of these systems , we recall that a granular gas displays non - gaussian velocity behavior , the breakdown of energy equipartition and of thermodynamic equilibrium , spontaneous breaking of many symmetries ( shear instability , cluster instability , convection instability , etc . ) and a general strong tendency to reduce the range of scales available to a hydrodynamic description . nevertheless , in a carefully controlled environment , one can avoid all spatial effects , obtaining a homogeneous granular gas whose main feature is to be stationary and out of thermodynamic equilibrium , traversed by an energy current that flows from the external driving into an irreversible sink constituted by the inelastic collisions among the grains . in this case",
    "it is straightforward to measure a so - called _ granular temperature _ @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the space dimension ) which is different , in general , from the temperature @xmath9 characterizing the external driving .",
    "we stress that , in real experiments , it is hard to obtain a stochastic way of pumping energy into a granular gas : the simplest situation is a vertically vibrating mechanism , where density gradients arise . in this paper",
    "our interest goes to models where the action of the external driving is in fact that of a homogeneous thermostat .",
    "such a kind of homogeneous heating has already been achieved experimentally with a granular mono - layer vibrated on a rough plate @xcite .",
    "very recently granular gases have been used to probe the latest theoretical results concerning fluctuations in non - equilibrium systems . in particular the so - called gallavotti - cohen fluctuation relation ( gcfr )",
    "@xcite has been put under scrutiny  @xcite .",
    "this relation is a constraint in the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the fluctuations of entropy flux in the system , which is rigorously demonstrated under certain hypothesis when the entropy flux is measured by the phase space contraction rate .",
    "of course an all - purpose definition of `` entropy flux '' in systems out of equilibrium does not exist .",
    "the authors of those recent studies have tried to use the rate of energy injection from the external driving , i.e. the injected power , as a entropy flux .",
    "even if in  @xcite a verification of the gcfr was claimed , other studies have shown that the situation is more complex and that , in general , the injected power in a granular gas can not satisfy such relation  @xcite . the main difference between a granular gas and the prototypical system that should obey",
    "the gcfr is the invariance under microscopic time reversal , which is violated by inelastic collisions .    in this paper",
    "we have tried to follow a simplified line of reasoning , obtaining a recipe to measure a `` flux '' which is constructed _ ad hoc _ with the aim of satisfying the gcfr , or at least its markovian counterpart , which has been put forward by lebowitz and spohn  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will refer to this relation as to the gc - ls fluctuation relation .",
    "our idea is to bypass the problem of `` strong irreversibility '' posed by inelastic collisions ( i.e. the fact that the probability of observing the time reversibility of an inelastic collision is strictly zero ) , focusing on the evolution of a tracer particle  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a dilute gas , a tracer particle performs a continuous markov process characterized by transition rates which are always defined , i.e. for any observable transition the time - reversed transition has a non - zero probability .",
    "therefore , the projection of a @xmath10-body system onto a @xmath11-body system somehow increases its degree of time reversibility .",
    "our original aim was to find a quantity , for granular gases , which , by construction , verifies the gc - ls fluctuation relation . besides the use of a single particle functional is still interesting because it can easily be reproduced in real experiments .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations of this functional are much stronger than the fluctuations of some other observable which is averaged over a large number of particles , and this is an evident advantage in an experimental verification of a fluctuation relation .",
    "anyway , we will show by numerical simulations that this verification poses unexpected problems , even after having followed carefully the recipe given by lebowitz and spohn . only at very large integration times and for situations very far from equilibrium , the gc - ls fluctuation relation is near to be satisfied . at the same time",
    "an alternative functional can be defined , differing from the first one by an apparently small term .",
    "this second functional always satisfies a relation which we consider the markovian counterpart of the evans - searles ( es ) fluctuation relation  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "our investigation has led to a concrete example , ready to become a real experiment , where the difference between two fluctuation relations , their meaning and their limits can directly be probed .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii we define our model and its description in terms of a continuous markov process , i.e. giving the transition rates that enter its master equation . in this section",
    "we also show that , whenever the surrounding gas has a non - gaussian velocity distribution , the tracer particle violates detailed balance and is therefore out of equilibrium . in section iii",
    "we define the action functionals that are expected to verify the gc - ls and es fluctuation relations .",
    "in section iv we discuss the results of numerical simulations , showing a way to optimally measure the transition rates and finally discussing the measure of the fluctuations of the action functionals and their verification of the fluctuation relations .",
    "we will draw our conclusions in section v. the derivation of the master equation from the linear boltzmann equation , is given in the appendix .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a tracer granular particle in a homogeneous and dilute gas of grains which is driven by an unspecified energy source .",
    "the first essential feature of the gas is its spatial and temporal homogeneity .",
    "the tracer particle collides sequentially with particles of the gas coming from the same `` population '' , independently of the position and time of the collision .",
    "the gas is characterized by its velocity probability density function @xmath12 , which in turn is determined by the unspecified details of the model , such as the properties of the driving or of the grains .",
    "it is well known that the velocity probability density function of a driven granular gas is non - gaussian : in a homogeneous setup the slight departure from gaussianity is well reproduced by a first sonine correction ( which will be made explicit in the following ) .",
    "this is expected theoretically and well verified in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the second essential property required is the diluteness of the gas : it guarantees that the evolution as well as the stationary regime of the velocity probability density function @xmath13 of the tracer is governed by a linear boltzmann equation . in this section",
    "we give expressions for the tracer transition rates in generic dimension @xmath8 and for a generic inter - particle ( short range ) potential .",
    "this potential is parametrized by a parameter @xmath14 which is the exponent of the term @xmath15 representing the collision kernel in the linear boltzmann equation ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the colliding velocities while @xmath18 is the unitary vector joining the particles ) .",
    "for example , a value of @xmath19 corresponds to the hard sphere potential ( which will be studied in the rest of the article , without losing generality in the results ) , a value of @xmath20 corresponds to the maxwell molecules case and a value of @xmath21 to the so - called very hard particles .",
    "the inelastic collisions with the gas particles , which solely determine the instantaneous changes of the velocity of the tracer , are described by the simplest and most used inelastic collision rule : @xmath22 { \\hat{\\boldsymbol \\omega}}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the velocities of the tracer before and after the collision respectively , @xmath17 is the velocity of the gas particle , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the masses of the tracer and of the gas particle respectively , while @xmath18 is the unitary vector joining the centers of the two particles . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath27 , but this will not change the generality of our results , in view of the following relation @xmath28    the @xmath14-boltzmann equation for the tracer , in generic dimension @xmath8 , reads : @xmath29 { \\hat{\\boldsymbol \\omega}}\\right ) -\\delta(\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v}_1)\\right\\}\\ ] ] where the primed integral denotes that the integration is performed on all angles that satisfy @xmath30 .",
    "the mean free path @xmath31 appears in front of the collision integrals . in the @xmath32 cases , to respect dimensionality , a factor @xmath33 is also present , where @xmath34 is the gas thermal velocity . in the following ( when not stated differently )",
    "we will put @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which can be always obtained by a rescaling of time .    from the analysis of equation  ( [ boltzmann ] ) given in appendix ,",
    "we find that the evolution of the velocity probability density function of the tracer is governed by the following master equation :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the velocity pdf of the test particle . the transition rate @xmath39 of jumping from @xmath23 to @xmath24 is given by the following formula : @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the change of velocity of the test particle after a collision .",
    "the vectorial function @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the unitary vector parallel to @xmath45 , while @xmath46 is entirely contained in the @xmath47-dimensional space perpendicular to @xmath48 ( i.e. @xmath49 ) .",
    "this implies that the integral in expression   is @xmath47-dimensional .",
    "finally , to fully determine the transition rate ( [ eq : k ] ) , the expression of @xmath50 is needed : @xmath51    note that equation  ( [ eq : markov ] ) is a master equation for the evolution of a probability density function .",
    "we simplify the terminology , using the name `` transition rate '' for the function @xmath39 , which actually is a `` transition rate density '' .",
    "this density has its natural definition in the following limit :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the probability that the tracer , after a collision , has a velocity @xmath54 contained in a sphere @xmath55 of radius @xmath56 centered in the vector @xmath24 , having a velocity @xmath23 before the collision .",
    "if @xmath57 , it then immediately follows that the transition rate @xmath58 reads : @xmath59    in kinetic theory , one of the most used corrections to the gaussian is the first non - zero sonine polynomial approximation  @xcite .",
    "this means assuming that @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the calculation of the integral needed to have an explicit expression of the transition rate is straightforward : @xmath62 this leads to @xmath63      here , we obtain a simple expression for the ratio between @xmath64 and @xmath65 . when exchanging @xmath23 with @xmath24 the unitary vector @xmath66 change of sign .",
    "furthermore one has that @xmath67 .",
    "finally it must be recognized that @xmath68 this equivalence is naturally achieved by considering the definition  ( [ definition ] ) and taking uniformly the two limits @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "from all these considerations and from equation   one obtains immediately : @xmath71}{\\int { \\textrm{d}}{{\\bf v}}_{2\\tau}p[\\mathbf{v}_2({{\\bf v } } ' , { { \\bf v } } ) ] } \\equiv   \\frac{p[v_{2 \\sigma } ( { { \\bf v } } , { { \\bf v}}')]}{p[v_{2 \\sigma } ( { { \\bf v } } ' , { { \\bf v}})]}\\,\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    we note that this ratio depends only on the choice of the pdf of the gas , @xmath72 , and not on the other parameters ( such as @xmath14 or @xmath0 ) .",
    "however in realistic situations ( experiments or molecular dynamics simulations ) @xmath72 is not a free parameter but is determined by the choice of the setup ( e.g. external driving , material details , geometry of the container , etc . ) .",
    "introducing the short - hand notation @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we also note that    @xmath76    from which it follows that    @xmath77    where @xmath78 then @xmath79 ( energy conservation ) . from the above considerations it follows that    * in the * gaussian * case , it is found + @xmath80 * in the * first sonine correction * case , it is found + @xmath81\\right\\}}{\\left\\{1+a_2s_2^{d=1}\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\alpha}(v_{\\sigma}-v_{\\sigma}')+v_{\\sigma}'\\right)^2}{2t}\\right]\\right\\}}\\ ] ]    in the case where @xmath82 is a gaussian with temperature @xmath9 , it is immediate to observe that @xmath83 if @xmath84 is equal to a gaussian with temperature @xmath85 .",
    "this means that there is a gaussian stationary solution of equation   ( in the gaussian - bulk case ) , which satisfies detailed balance .",
    "the fact that such a gaussian with a different temperature @xmath86 is an exact stationary solution was known from  @xcite .",
    "it thus turns out that detailed balance is satisfied , even out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "of course this is an artifact of such a model : it is highly unrealistic that a granular gas yields a gaussian velocity pdf .",
    "as soon as the gas velocity pdf @xmath82 ceases to be gaussian , detailed balance is violated , i.e. the stationary process performed by the tracer particle is no more in equilibrium within the thermostatting gas .",
    "we will see in section  [ noneq ] how to characterize this departure from equilibrium .",
    "the velocity dependent collision rate is defined as    @xmath87   ( \\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v}')\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}p(\\mathbf{v}')\\ ] ]    where the last passage is true for hard spheres . in the following , for simplicity and for direct comparison with numerical results",
    ", we will consider only the model of a two - dimensional hard sphere gas .",
    "in this particular case , the collision rate reads :    * for a gaussian bulk : + @xmath88\\ ] ] + where @xmath89 is the @xmath90-th modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "note that from equation   one obtains the total collision frequency : @xmath91 which , using @xmath92 for the mean free path gives @xmath93 in the case @xmath94 , i.e. the known result from kinetic theory for the elastic hard disks",
    ". finally note that @xmath95 for the gaussian case _ does not depend _ upon the restitution coefficient ( while the transition rates and the total collision frequency do ) .",
    "* for a bulk with a gaussian distribution plus the first sonine approximation : + @xmath96.\\ ] ] + in this case the expression for @xmath97 is more involved .",
    "from the previous section we have learnt that the dynamics of the velocity of a tracer particle immersed in a granular gas is equivalent to a markov process with well defined transition rates .",
    "this means that the velocity of the tracer particle stays in a state @xmath23 for a random time @xmath98 distributed with the law @xmath99 and then makes a transition to a new value @xmath24 with a probability @xmath100 . at this point",
    "it is interesting to ask about some characterization of the non - equilibrium dynamics , i.e. of the violation of detailed balance , which we know to happen whenever the surrounding granular gas has a non - gaussian distribution of velocity .    to this extent ,",
    "we define two different action functionals , following  @xcite :    [ entropy ] @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the index of collision suffered by the tagged particle , @xmath103 is the velocity of the particle before the @xmath102-th collision , @xmath104 is its post - collisional velocity , @xmath105 is the total number of collisions in the trajectory from time @xmath106 up to time @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the transition rate of the jump due to the collision . finally , we have used the notation @xmath109 to identify the probability of observing the trajectory @xmath110 .",
    "the quantities @xmath111 and @xmath112 are different for each different trajectory ( i.e. sequence of jumps ) of the tagged particle . the first term @xmath113 in the definition of @xmath112 , eq .",
    ", will be called in the following `` boundary term '' to stress its non - extensivity in time .",
    "the two above functionals have the following properties :    * @xmath114 if there is exact symmetry , i.e. if @xmath115 ( e.g. in the microcanonical ensemble ) ; @xmath116 if there is detailed balance ( e.g. any equilibrium ensemble ) ; * we expect that , for @xmath107 large enough , for almost all the trajectories @xmath117 ; here ( since the system under investigation is ergodic and stationary ) the meaning of @xmath118 is intuitively an average over many independent segments of a single very long trajectory ; * for large enough @xmath107 : 1 ) at equilibrium @xmath119 ; 2 ) out of equilibrium ( i.e. if detailed balance is not satisfied ) those two averages are positive ; we use those equivalent averages , at large @xmath107 , to characterize the distance from equilibrium of the stationary system ; * if @xmath120 is the entropy associated to the pdf of the velocity of the tagged particle @xmath121 at time @xmath107 ( e.g. @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the boltzmann - h function ) , then + @xmath124 + where @xmath125 is always non - negative , @xmath126 is linear with respect to @xmath84 and , finally , @xmath127 .",
    "this leads to consider @xmath111 equivalent to the contribution of a single trajectory to the total entropy flux . in a stationary state @xmath128 and",
    "therefore the flux is equivalent to the production ; this property has been recognized in  @xcite . * * @xmath129 * ( lebowitz - spohn - gallavotti - cohen fluctuation relation ) : @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the probability density function of finding @xmath133 at time @xmath107 ; at equilibrium the @xmath129 has no content ; note that in principle @xmath134 at any finite time ; a generic derivation of this property has been obtained in  @xcite , while a rigorous proof with more restrictive hypothesis is in  @xcite ; the discussion for the case of a langevin equation is in  @xcite . * * @xmath135 * ( evans - searles fluctuation relation ) : @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 is the probability density function of finding @xmath139 at time @xmath107 ; at equilibrium the @xmath135 has no content ;    on the one side we have called @xmath140 a `` lebowitz - spohn - gallavotti - cohen '' fluctuation relation , following  @xcite , where the analogy with the original gallavotti - cohen fluctuation relation has been stated explicitly . on the other side",
    "we have called the @xmath135 a `` evans - searles '' fluctuation relation , inspired by the following analogy . the original gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem concerns the fluctuation of a functional @xmath141 which is the time - averaged phase space contraction rate , i.e. @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the phase space contraction rate at the point @xmath144 in the phase space visited by the system at time @xmath145 . on the other side , the original evans - searles fluctuation theorem  @xcite concerns the fluctuation of a functional @xmath146 ( often called `` dissipation function '' ) defined as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the phase space density function at time @xmath106 , @xmath149 is the probability of observing at time @xmath106 an infinitesimal phase space volume of size @xmath150 around the point @xmath151 , and @xmath152 is the time reversal operator which typically leaves the position unaltered and changes the sign of the velocities .",
    "the last equality in equation   follows from the liouville equation written in lagrangian form : @xmath153 ( details on its derivation can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of probabilities appearing at the end of the r.h.s . of   can be thought as the deterministic equivalent of the ratio of probabilities appearing at the end of the r.h.s of definition  .",
    "the term @xmath154 is instead analogous to the term @xmath113 , since the system can be prepared at time @xmath106 in such a way that its phase space density function @xmath155 is arbitrarily near to its stationary invariant measure .",
    "the analogy between those two terms , and therefore between the two pairs of functionals @xmath156 and @xmath157 , can not be derived mathematically rigorously , at the moment , but formally at least , it looks rather convincing .",
    "note also that the difference between the two functionals of each couple vanishes when the invariant phase space distribution function becomes constant , e.g. in the microcanonical ensemble .    as a final remark of this section , consider the more general case where the tracer particle feels the external driving too",
    ": this means that other transitions are possible .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to an external driving modeled as a thermostat which acts on the grains in the form of independent random kicks  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to recognize that the transition rates competing to the velocity changes due to these kicks are symmetric and therefore do not contribute to the action functionals in eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , when one wants to include the effect of walls ( both still or vibrating ) , new transition rates should be taken into account . a collision with a wall",
    "can be modeled as a collision with a flat body with infinite mass , so that @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the direction perpendicular to the wall and @xmath160 is the wall velocity in that direction at the time @xmath107 of the collision , while @xmath161 is the restitution coefficient which describes the energy dissipation during such collision .",
    "if the wall is still ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 then the transition is non - reversible and this results in a divergent contribution to the action functionals .",
    "if the wall is still but elastic , then again the transition rates are symmetric and do not contribute to the action functionals .",
    "finally , if the wall is vibrating the transition rates will depend upon the probability @xmath164 of finding the vibrating wall at a certain velocity @xmath165 .",
    "a direct simulation monte carlo  @xcite is devised to simulate in dimension @xmath166 the dynamics of a tracer particle undergoing inelastic collisions with a gas of particles in a stationary state with a given velocity pdf @xmath12 .",
    "the simulated model contains three parameters : the restitution coefficient @xmath0 , the temperature of the gas @xmath9 ( which we take as unity ) and the coefficient of the first sonine correction which parametrizes the velocity pdf of the gas , @xmath167 .",
    "the tracer particle has a `` temperature '' @xmath168 and a velocity pdf that is observed to be well described again by a first sonine correction to a gaussian , parametrized by a coefficient @xmath169 .",
    "we also use @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the elastic mean free time is @xmath170 ( it is larger in inelastic cases ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath3 are measured along independent ( non - overlapping ) segments of time - length @xmath2 extracted from a unique trajectory .      in this subsection",
    "we verify the correctness of formula   for the gaussian bulk and formula   for the non - gaussian ( sonine - corrected ) bulk .",
    "since the algorithm used ( the dsmc  @xcite ) is known to very well reproduce the molecular chaos assumption , which is the unique hypothesis used to obtain those formula , we consider this verification a mere check of the consistency of algorithms and calculations . on the other side , while performing this verification , we have devised a way of optimizing the measurement of the transition rates , which can be adopted in experiments .    the brute force method of measuring @xmath108 in an experiment or a simulation is to observe subsequent collisions for a long time @xmath107 and cumulate them in a @xmath171-dimensional ( @xmath172-dimensional ) matrix @xmath173 : this means that @xmath174 contains the number of observed collisions such that the precollisional and postcollisional velocities are contained in a cubic region centered in @xmath175 and of volume @xmath176 finite but small . at the same time it is necessary to measure @xmath177 for the tagged particle .",
    "these quantities are related by the following formula : @xmath178 which can be immediately inverted to obtain @xmath64 . anyway",
    "this recipe may require a very large statistics , because of the high dimensionality of the histogram @xmath173 .",
    "then we notice that @xmath108 is a function of only @xmath179 .",
    "it becomes tempting , therefore , to reduce the number of variables from @xmath172 to @xmath180 in order to optimize the procedure .",
    "a histogram @xmath181 of dimensionality @xmath180 ( in any dimension ) can be obtained , so that each element @xmath182 contains the number of observed collisions such that the projection along the direction @xmath183 of the precollisional velocity is @xmath184 and that of the postcollisional velocity is @xmath185 .",
    "we note that @xmath186 in the last passage , we have done the change of variables ( at fixed @xmath187 ) @xmath188 .",
    "this implies the appearing of the associated jacobian .",
    "moreover , it happens that @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "postponing the problem of finding the jacobian @xmath191 , we can absorb the dirac deltas , obtaining : @xmath192 where @xmath193 is just the transition probability @xmath108 as a function of @xmath194 ( which is its natural representation ) .",
    "the change of variables is given by the following rule :    @xmath195    after calculations , the jacobian reads : @xmath196 from the expression of the jacobian , and taking into account the isotropy of @xmath197 one gets @xmath198 where @xmath199    as already discussed , the result by martin and piasecki  @xcite explains that when the velocity - pdf of the gas is gaussian , then also the tagged particle has a gaussian pdf . in particular",
    "if the bulk has a temperature @xmath9 , the tagged particle has a temperature @xmath200 .",

    "we first discuss numerical observation : they concern , generically , `` deviations '' , i.e. fluctuations at finite time and finite values of the variables .",

    "the averages @xmath245 and @xmath246 converge to the same value in a time smaller than @xmath247 average collision times ( frame a of figure  [ fig : stat ] ) .",
    "the analysis of fluctuations ( frames b and c ) , by means of the measure of their variance , instead indicates that the convergence is much more slower .",
    "remarkably the convergence is slower when the system is closer to equilibrium .",
    "we also tried to answer to the question : is it possible to verify the fluctuation relation @xmath129 at finite times in the regime ( large @xmath2 ) where the two functionals have negligible differences ?",
    "the main obstacle to the verification of a fluctuation relation is the lack of negative events at large values of @xmath2 .",
    "the probability of finding a negative event is equivalent to the probability of finding a negative deviation from the mean of the order of the mean itself .",
    "we have seen that when the pdf of @xmath1 seems to converge to its asymptotic scaling form , its tails are not far from those of a gaussian and the bulk ( i.e. its `` small deviation '' range ) is clearly gaussian .",
    "this means that there is a very sensitive decay of probability in the range of a finite number of standard deviations from the mean . from a numerical point of view",
    "it is very unlikely to observe values of @xmath1 below the value @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the @xmath25-th cumulant of @xmath1 , or , equivalently , that it is very unlikely to observe negative events if @xmath250 .",
    "frame d of figure  [ fig : stat ] shows the ratio between @xmath251 and @xmath241 .",
    "the conclusion of this analysis is that when @xmath2 is large enough to guarantee , at least at the level of the second cumulant , the convergence of the pdf of @xmath228 ( or its convergence to the pdf of @xmath4 ) , the probability of observing negative events is so small that a huge statistics is required , in order to make reliable measurement of the fluctuation relation .",
    "we now discuss one possible reason for such a slow convergence of the pdf of the fluctuations of @xmath1 . we will call it the `` boundary term catastrophe '' . as a matter of fact it seems that @xmath1 , even at very large values of @xmath2 , more evidently in the close - to - equilibrium cases , _ remembers _ its own small time fluctuations .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fig : pdf_gc ] , four topmost frames .",
    "the tails of @xmath1 at large @xmath2 are almost identical to those at small @xmath2 .",
    "what is happening ?",
    "if one looks closely at expression  , which is summed over many collisions to give @xmath111 , discovers that @xmath252 where we have used a shortened notation to identify the `` non - equilibrium '' part which is the sum over all the collisions in the time @xmath2 of the logarithms of ratios between the sonine contributions .",
    "the sum of the energy differences reduces to a difference between the first and the last term , which we can call again a `` boundary term '' .",
    "it easy to realize that the pdf of this term alone , being the pdf of a difference of energies , has exponential tails ( in granular gases they can be even slower ) .",
    "this is the dominant term in the fluctuations of @xmath1 at small @xmath2 and it can dominate the fluctuations of @xmath1 even at very large @xmath2 , depending on the amplitude of the fluctuations of the `` sonine '' term .",
    "the `` sonine '' term is small near equilibrium and increases as the system gets far from equilibrium .",
    "this explains why the memory is stronger ( i.e. convergence is lower ) as the system is closer to equilibrium .",
    "the situation dramatically changes when looking at the second functional , @xmath3 .",
    "the `` boundary term '' discussed above almost perfectly annihilates with the boundary term appearing in the definition of @xmath112 . following the numerical observation that the pdf @xmath84 of the velocity of the tracer is almost gaussian with temperature @xmath253 , in fact we see that    @xmath254    the error in this approximation is of the same order of one of the sonine terms appearing in the sum   and is therefore subleading at large times .",
    "this crucial observation explains the absence of exponential tails in the pdf of @xmath112 .",
    "it should be stressed that this `` boundary term catastrophe '' has relevant consequences not only in the realm of numerical simulations , but also from the point of view of large deviation theory .",
    "we suspect that , even with a computer of infinite power , i.e. with the ability of measuring with infinite quality the pdf of @xmath1 at any time @xmath2 , the results of a large deviation analysis would yield similar results : the exponential tails related to the pdf of the @xmath255 are never forgotten .",
    "this is the consequence of the following simple observation : following the definition of `` large deviations rate '' of a pdf @xmath256 which depends upon a parameter @xmath107 , we can also calculate the large deviations rate of a pdf @xmath257 which _ does not depend _ upon that parameter .",
    "we recall the definition :    @xmath258    it can be immediately seen that such definition gives a _",
    "result if applied to a pdf @xmath257 with exponential tails , even if it does not depend upon @xmath107 .",
    "this is equivalent to state that exponential tails always contribute to large deviations .",
    "the apparent loss of memory that can be observed in the strong non - equilibrium cases of figure  [ fig : pdf_gc ] is only due to the limited range available in the measure of the pdf : these tails , in fact , get farther and farther as time increases .",
    "moreover we recall that such exponential tails are associated to the distribution of energy fluctuations and are always present in a system with a finite number of particles , not only in the @xmath11-particle case .",
    "they disappear only in the thermodynamic limit or in the presence of physical boundaries .",
    "we conclude this discussion mentioning that the boundary term catastrophe is responsible for the failure of gc fluctuation relation in other systems  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the dynamics of a tracer particle in a driven granular gas .",
    "the tracer performs a sequence of collisions changing its velocity , thus performing a markov process with transition rates that can be obtained from the linear boltzmann equation .",
    "we have given a general expression for these rates , and we have also calculated them for a number of possible interesting cases . there is a major discrimination between the gaussian and the non - gaussian case , depending upon the velocity distribution of the gas particles . in the gaussian case",
    "the tracer is at equilibrium , even if the collisions are dissipative and energy equipartition is not satisfied . in the non - gaussian case",
    "the tracer reaches a statistically stationary non - equilibrium state : in this state a dissipative flow can be measured in the form of an action functional that has been defined by lebowitz and spohn  @xcite .",
    "the average of this flow well describes the distance from equilibrium .",
    "moreover the rate of variation of the entropy of the tracer can be split up in two contributions , one always positive and the second given by the average of this dissipative flux .",
    "following the lebowitz and spohn `` recipe '' we have tried to verify the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation relation for the action functional , realizing that this verification is not accessible . at the same time",
    "we have perfectly verified a second fluctuation relation , for a slightly different functional , which we have called evans - searles fluctuation relation because of a formal analogy with it .",
    "we have discussed the possibility that a non - extensive term ( in time ) in the definition of the lebowitz - spohn functional can spoil the applicability of the large deviation principle . in our numerical simulations",
    "we have also very well verified the correctness of the formula for the transition rates , showing a way to optimize their measure in real experiments .",
    "a key point of our work is in fact that such lagrangian approach in granular gas theory should be applied to experiments on dilute granular matter , in order to test directly the limits of the different fluctuation relations .",
    "future work will be directed to the study of transients and non - homogeneous situations .",
    "the evans - searles fluctuation relation is expected to hold also in non stationary regimes , such as the transient relaxation of a packet of non - interacting tracer granular particles prepared in some non - typical initial state .",
    "non - homogeneous situations , such as a boundary driven granular gas , are characterized by the presence of spatially directed fluxes .",
