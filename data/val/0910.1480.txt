    "consistent observational evidence from various cosmological probes shows that the universe is currently undergoing a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "the observed expansion history can be explained using some form of dark energy or a cosmological constant ; however this cosmological constant can not be explained with current particle physics due to its very small value .",
    "an alternative approach is to invoke a modification of gravity ; there are many different ways that gravity and/or the equation of state of the dark energy can be modified to allow for the expansion history observed .",
    "this makes it impossible to differentiate between the effects of modified gravity and dark energy by measuring the background expansion history alone .",
    "however , modifying gravity also produces a distinct growth rate of structure ; thus the expansion history and growth history together can be used to distinguish between various models of gravity .",
    "this consistency relation to test gr has been proposed and explored by many papers @xcite .",
    "upcoming weak lensing surveys such as des , pan - starrs and lsst , and future space surveys such as euclid , will allow a combination of growth of structure and expansion history to be probed to considerably higher precision , which will allow many gravity models to be excluded .",
    "there has been a great deal of work showing how to use weak lensing to discriminate between different gravity models ; however this has been restricted to probing the linear regime of the matter power spectrum @xcite or uses methods that do not obtain gr at small scales @xcite .",
    "the non - linear regime provides much of the power for lensing and can be most easily probed by current and upcoming lensing surveys .",
    "this paper examines the effect of including the non - linear regime in modified gravity lensing predictions , including the small - scale gr limit , to see how useful weak lensing will be overall when trying to determine the correct model of gravity .",
    "first we look at dgp and @xmath0 gravity models as examples , and investigate weak lensing s ability to differentiate between these models and dark energy models .",
    "we then take a more phenomenological point of view , by parameterising the shape of the matter power spectrum and examining the sensitivity of weak lensing observables to changes to the matter distribution when the expansion history is the same for each model considered . using these parameters",
    "we show how strongly a ground - based survey similar to des and a space - based survey such as euclid will be able to discriminate between different growth histories with identical expansion histories .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ lensmodgrav ]",
    "we briefly describe the dgp and @xmath0 models of gravity and how they compare with dark energy models .",
    "we describe how we calculate matter power spectra for these models , including the gr small - scale limit .",
    "we also describe how we proceed to calculate weak lensing observables from these power spectra . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the resulting lensing correlation functions , including realistic errors for future surveys taking into account shape measurement noise and cosmic covariance . in section [ parameterisation ]",
    "we take the alternative approach of parameterising the non - linear power spectrum , and we investigate how sensitive weak lensing is to these parameters which go beyond the usual growth parameter .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use a flat cosmology with the wmap5+sne+bao best fit cosmological parameters , which are determined by the background evolution of the universe .",
    "we use a @xmath2cdm background for both @xmath2cdm and @xmath0 , in which case we take @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "when we use a dgp background , we have @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xcite giving a @xmath10 for an equivalent @xmath2cdm model .",
    "as we have already mentioned , there are two key phenomena to model in any gravity in order to calculate the matter power spectrum : the expansion history , quantified by the evolution of the hubble parameter , and the growth history , quantified by the evolution of density perturbations @xmath12 in the universe .    for @xmath2cdm",
    ", the expansion history is given by the friedmann equation    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the scale factor and @xmath16 is the present day hubble constant .",
    "the growth history is described by the density perturbation evolution equation together with the friedmann equation . at this point",
    "we will limit ourselves to the regime where density perturbations evolve linearly . in this regime",
    "we have @xmath17 where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "this equation is valid for both dark energy and modified gravity models , where @xmath18 is the effective gravitational constant normalised by the gravitational constant @xmath19 ; hence @xmath20 for dark energy models , while for modified gravity models    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is determined by the model .    in this paper , we consider dgp @xcite and @xmath0 as examples of modified gravity models , as the non - linear power spectra have been studied in great detail in these two models using perturbation theory and n - body simulations .",
    "for some reviews of modified gravity models see @xcite .    in dgp , spacetime has five dimensions , while we live on a 4d brane in the 5d bulk .",
    "standard model particles are bound on the 4d brane , as is gravity on small scales ; however on large scales gravity leaks off the brane causing late time acceleration .",
    "the scale of the transition from 4d to 5d gravity is governed by the crossover scale , @xmath23 . the extra dimension contributes a further term to the friedmann equation whose amplitude is governed by @xmath24 : @xmath25 the growth history is also altered , giving @xcite @xmath26 in @xmath0 gravity models the einstein - hilbert action is modified to include an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar , @xmath27 . in this study",
    "we use an @xmath0 function of the form @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath27 is the ricci scalar , @xmath29 is the present day ricci scalar and @xmath30 .",
    "we use @xmath31 , which has been found to fit with cluster constraints @xcite , to give a background evolution which is approximately @xmath2cdm to sub - percent level .",
    "this allows us to use the @xmath2cdm friedmann equation and only alter the density evolution equation @xcite with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dimensionless wavenumber defined as @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the wavenumber and @xmath36 is the speed of light .    for modified gravity to agree with solar system observations it must approach a gr solution on small scales .",
    "this means that the non - linear power spectrum must be an interpolation of the modified gravity non - linear power spectrum with no mechanism to obtain the gr result on small scales , @xmath37 , and the gr non - linear power spectrum with the same expansion history as the modified gravity model , @xmath38 .",
    "a fitting formula for this interpolation was proposed by @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 picks out non - linear scales and @xmath41 determines the scale at which the power spectrum approaches the gr result as a function of redshift .    in this paper , we use the fitting fomulae for @xmath40 and @xmath41 obtained by perturbation theory @xcite and confirmed by n - body simulations @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the modified gravity linear power spectrum .",
    "the non - linear power spectrum for both the @xmath44 and @xmath45 is found using the @xcite fitting formula from the linear power spectrum . for dgp , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 and for @xmath0 with @xmath49",
    "we use @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "it should be noted these values are not valid for all @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "however , in dgp , these values depend on @xmath54 and @xmath55 very weakly , so within our priors for @xmath54 and @xmath55 we can assume the values are constant",
    ".    we should also emphasise that these fits are confirmed only up to @xmath56/mpc due to the lack of resolution in n - body simulations , so we are extrapolating the fits beyond this regime .",
    "clearly it is necessary to check the validity of this extrapolation using n - body simulations with higher resolution ( see @xcite for a different approach using the halo model ) .",
    "however , since the modified gravity power spectrum should approach the gr non - linear power spectrum with the same expansion history , and since the fitting formula ( [ eq : husaw ] ) ensures this , our extrapolation is justified .    in applying this formalism",
    ", we found that although @xmath0 fits the n - body results at small @xmath35 , it failed to converge with @xmath2cdm at larger @xmath35 if @xmath51 .",
    "this is due to the strong scale dependence of the linear power spectrum , such that @xmath44 deviates from @xmath45 strongly on small scales and equation ( [ eq : ppf ] ) with @xmath57 fails to converge with @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we also consider @xmath47 and @xmath58 cases for @xmath0 which have more physical behaviour at high @xmath35 .",
    "since we are interested in how sensitive weak lensing is to different growth histories with the same expansion history , we will also consider a quintessence cold dark matter ( qcdm ) model . in this case , the equation of state of the dark energy is altered to match the expansion history of dgp , while the density perturbation evolution equations are the same as @xmath2cdm .",
    "we show examples of the resulting matter power spectra in figure [ fig : p_delta ] .",
    "@xmath0 models show the scale dependent enhancement of the power spectrum in the linear regime compared with @xmath2cdm . for @xmath51 , which fits n - body results well up to @xmath56/mpc",
    ", the power spectrum fails to converge with @xmath2cdm . on the other hand",
    ", the power spectrum with @xmath58 shows clear convergence ; this is shown more explicitly in figure [ fig : p_delta diff ] .",
    "we also show a comparison between dgp and qcdm power in figure [ fig : p_delta_qcdm ] , including our non - linear prescription . in the linear regime",
    "the dgp power spectrum receives scale independent suppressions , but it converges to the qcdm power spectrum on non - linear scales due to our inclusion of the gr asymptote .",
    "the mass distribution described by the matter power spectrum deflects light all the way along the path from source to observer , so any changes in the matter power spectrum alter the observed image distortion of galaxies .",
    "light bundles are transformed by a shear with two components , @xmath59 , and an isotropic dilation , the convergence @xmath60 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the jacobian mapping from the unlensed image to the distorted image is given by @xmath61 since each galaxy has some unknown intrinsic shape , the amount of lensing can not be estimated by a single source ; however one can correlate the shear estimators of many sources , in which case randomly oriented intrinsic ellipticities will average out , leaving the gravitational shear signal .",
    "this will not succeed if galaxy ellipticities are physically aligned , which they are to some degree ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , for our purposes we will assume that the resulting physical correlation signal can be removed , leaving only the lensing signal . here",
    "we will concentrate on the convergence correlation function , equal to the sum of the shear correlation functions , which is related to the convergence power spectrum by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the angular distance between the correlated sources and @xmath64 is the angular wavenumber .",
    "the convergence power spectrum is related to the matter power spectrum by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath65 with @xmath66 where @xmath67 is comoving distance , @xmath68 is the comoving distance to the horizon and @xmath69 is the normalised distribution of the sources in comoving distance , corresponding to a redshift distribution . equation ( [ eq : w ] ) is valid for flat cosmologies , which are all that are considered in this paper .",
    "we will calculate results for realistic notional surveys : a ground - based survey similar to that of the dark energy survey ( des ) , and a space - based survey such as that of euclid , using redshift distributions shown in figure [ fig : redshiftdistribution ] ; the redshift distribution for our ground - based survey was chosen to be the same as for cfhtls given by @xcite giving a median redshift , @xmath70 , of 0.825 and for euclid we used the distribution given by @xcite giving @xmath71 .",
    "this can be extended to cross - correlate sources at different redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to obtain @xmath72 where @xmath73 include the galaxy distributions @xmath74 appropriate for the @xmath75th redshift bin .",
    "this equation together with equation ( [ eq : ckappa ] ) relates the matter power spectra from our gravity models to the predicted lensing signal ; we will now use these tools to calculate lensing predictions for our models .",
    "it should be noted that in our analysis we have not included the effects of baryons , which are known to have an effect on the matter power spectrum for @xmath76 as shown in @xcite . for non - radiative gas simulations",
    "this changes the amplitude of the matter power spectrum by a few percent , however if gas cooling and star formation are included this effect could be considerably larger .",
    "therefore for a full lensing analysis in the non - linear regime these effects must be included as well , but since we must recover gr on small scales , results from gas simulations for gr can be used to refine the models we present .",
    "we calculate the convergence ( combined shear ) correlation function of equation ( [ eq : ckappa ] ) for all of our models , and estimate measurement errors due to intrinsic ellipticity , for the notional ground - based and euclid surveys using bins with error @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "the errors were estimated using @xmath79 and a survey area of 5000 square degrees for our ground - based survey ( as is appropriate for des ) , while for euclid we use @xmath80 and 20000 square degrees .",
    "the covariance matrix for the intrinsic ellipticity noise is diagonal for bins in redshift and angular separation ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "we also include the covariance due to sample variance due to the cosmic matter distribution , @xmath81 , which is estimated using the horizon simulation @xcite .",
    "3-d convergence maps were calculated from the 3-d overdensity field , for 75 patches of area 2 square degrees ; convergence correlation functions were then measured in each patch .",
    "the covariance between the resulting patch correlation functions was measured as an estimator of the true covariance , in 8 angular separation bins logarithmically spaced from @xmath82 to @xmath83 and in 3 redshift bins ( leading to 6 redshift pair bins ) .",
    "the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for mean correlation functions are measured to be approximately @xmath84 per square degree , making the sample covariance the dominant source of error for larger angles and higher redshifts for both our ground - based survey , with diagonal element values of @xmath85 and euclid , @xmath85 .",
    "these should be compared with shape noise covariance contributions of @xmath86 for ground - based and @xmath87 for euclid .",
    "the covariances were included in our @xmath88 estimations using ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the ` data ' , here the fiducial @xmath2cdm correlation function in redshift and angular separation bins ; @xmath91 is the alternative gravity model correlation function in those bins , @xmath92 is the number of realisations of correlation functions used in the calculation of @xmath81 and @xmath93 is the total number of bins in angular separation and redshift .",
    "note that we use the sample covariance estimate from horizon ( which follows @xmath2cdm ) for both @xmath2cdm and qcdm cases ; the qcdm error bars should therefore only be considered as the correct order of magnitude .",
    "we calculate for each of our models the difference in @xmath88 between the modified gravity model and a dark energy model ( either @xmath2cdm or qcdm ) , applying wmap+sne+bao priors .",
    "note that for @xmath2cdm and @xmath0 , we used the @xmath2cdm background @xcite and for dgp and qcdm , the dgp background @xcite was used ( see  1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : correlation lcdm ] shows example results for our ground - based survey and euclid using the central cosmological parameter values for wmap+sne+bao described in  1 ; this is for the 2-d projection case where we have not divided the catalogue tomographically .",
    "we see from figures ( a ) and ( b ) that the difference between models is substantially greater in the nonlinear regime ( @xmath94 ) than in the linear regime ( @xmath95 ) , as is the amplitude of the signal . as ( c ) and",
    "( d ) show , it is also the case that the linear correlation function is small in the low-@xmath63 regime , if nonlinear corrections are not included .",
    "we present the @xmath88 differences between the modified gravities and fiducial dark energy models in table [ chi sq table ] , for the 2-d ( non - tomographic ) cases including non - linear power .",
    "we see that there is indeed strong discriminatory power between modified gravity models and @xmath2cdm with the notional ground - based survey ; the precision of euclid is even more impressive .",
    "we also compare the constraints on dgp and a qcdm model of the same expansion history ( i.e. a dgp background ) .",
    "the correlation functions for these models are shown in figure [ fig : correlation qcdm ] .",
    "one can either consider a qcdm model with cosmological parameters equal to their central values in a fit to wmap+bao+sne , or more realistically the best fit qcdm model to the dgp model obtained by varying @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we see that there is a choice of @xmath96 and @xmath55 that make the qcdm and dgp models virtually indistinguishable .",
    "this is confirmed by the bottom row of table [ chi sq table ] , which shows that the difference in @xmath88 for dgp and this qcdm is insignificant .",
    "this is clearly partly due to the existence of a qcdm model with rather similar growth to the dgp , but also because of the low amplitude of the dgp correlation function , with the result that the error bars are larger in proportion to the signal than for other models .",
    "the power of future surveys to discriminate between gravity models is borne out by the tomographic results .",
    "examples of these are shown in figure [ fig : correlation different z ] , where we see the different redshift evolutions and amplitudes of the signal in the different gravities .",
    "table [ chi sq table 2 ] confirms that using the redshift information affords us better discrimination between dark energy and modified gravity models in every case , by a factor of 50 to 100% .",
    "because of this , we will only consider tomographic results from now on in the paper .",
    ".@xmath97 for dgp and @xmath0 using errors from our ground - based survey and euclid , with no redshift information , and using priors from wmap@xmath98sne@xmath98bao .",
    "the top section shows results compared to @xmath2cdm , while the bottom row is compared to qcdm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one might think then that it is better not to include non - linear scales and constrain only @xmath1 on linear scales . however , there is substantial extra signal coming from the non - linear regime .",
    "in fact with our parameterisations , tables [ sigma1 sigma2 lcdm ] and [ sigma1 sigma2 dgp ] show the percentage difference between the 68% constraint obtained for @xmath1 if only a linear analysis is used compared to the full non - linear analysis with the fitting formula is 100% for the ground - based survey and 300% for euclid with a @xmath2cdm fiducial model and 70% for the ground - based survey and 140% for euclid with a dgp fiducial model .    the percentage overestimation , shown in tables [ sigma1 sigma2 lcdm ] and [ sigma1 sigma2 dgp ] , at the 68% level , in the ability of the ground - based survey and euclid to constrain @xmath1 if only the smith et .",
    "fitting formula is used is 10% for the ground - based survey and 40% for euclid with a @xmath2cdm fiducial model and 10% for ground - based survey and 60% for euclid with a dgp fiducial model .",
    "this demonstrates that if a full non - linear analysis is to be used then it is necessary to ensure that gr is obtained at small scales , and the extra parameters from the hu and sawicki fitting formula must also be measured .",
    "in this paper we have presented weak lensing predictions for modified gravity models , including the non - linear regime of the power spectrum .",
    "we have shown how the power spectrum is calculated for dgp , @xmath0 and qcdm models , using the fitting function of @xcite to explore deep into the non - linear regime , while including the fact that gravities should tend towards gr on small scales .",
    "we have calculated the total shear power spectrum given the modified gravity power spectrum , and have shown that this will be measured with high signal - to - noise with future lensing surveys such as euclid and des .",
    "we have taken into account the cosmic covariance in addition to the noise due to the intrinsic shapes of galaxies .",
    "we have shown that there is substantial additional discriminatory power between modified gravity models which is now afforded to us by the inclusion of the nonlinear power regime .",
    "we have also shown that using only the @xcite formula without any attempt to obtain the gr non - linear power spectrum on small scales leads to an overestimatation in the ability of future surveys to differentiate between different growth histories .",
    "we have parameterised the dark matter power spectrum using the growth factor @xmath1 and the parameters in the non - linear fitting function to see how well a ground - based survey similar to des , and a space - based survey such as euclid , will be able to put constraints on these .",
    "we have compared the results from this parameterisation with results obtained from using only linear scales and have shown the constraint on @xmath1 to be much tighter in the former case .",
