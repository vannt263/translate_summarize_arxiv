    "we have @xmath161 .",
    "it is clearly seen that when @xmath5 subsequent increasing of the field strength @xmath226 will just make red zones on fig.[plan_z ] ad lib narrow as it just decreases the effective cell thickness @xmath232 and increases screening strength .",
    "of course there is the limitation @xmath233 and frederiks transition takes place when @xmath0 . in this case",
    "as well @xmath234 as @xmath235 so that the deconfinement effect takes place before the frederiks transition point .",
    "we see that maps of interactions on the fig .",
    "[ plan_z ] are very resemble with fig .",
    "[ dd_unlim_p]- fig .",
    "[ qq_unlim_p ] .",
    "so we can try to extend our speculations in sec.ii for the planar nematic cell with the presence of the field .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the section ii , the external field applied in the nlc with positive @xmath5 along the @xmath98 induces the hedgehog transition to the saturn - ring , i.e. dipole type defect transforms into quadrupole @xcite . at the same time the @xmath0 case leads to the deconfinement effect and",
    "the influence of the cell planes disappears near the critical point @xmath157 for dipole - dipole interaction . in some sense",
    "the confined nlc becomes similar to the unlimited nematic .",
    "but we know that in the unlimited nematic lc the hedgehog configuration is the most stable @xcite .",
    "so there should be the point where saturn ring configuration loses it s stability , i.e. has higher energy than hedgehog . in the formulas , ,",
    "the main contribution has the term @xmath172 , so we may _",
    "put forward a hypothesis _ that it s possible to replace @xmath2 with @xmath236 in the ( [ as ] ) and to estimate the point of stability of the saturn ring configuration in the planar nematic cell with external electric field :    @xmath237    for particles with radius @xmath238 the saturn ring has the less energy than hedgehog and vice versa .",
    "when @xmath5 the external field decreases effective cell width and strengthens saturn ring stability . if the particle has radius @xmath239 and has the hedgehog director configuration , the external field with value @xmath240 , ( @xmath158 ) should make saturn ring configuration to be stable .",
    "we see that the threshold electric field @xmath241 decreases with increasing of the particle radius @xmath21 .",
    "this tendency was experimentally observed in @xcite for strong anchoring strength at the particle s surface that is in line with our speculations .    but nlc with @xmath0 has the opposite tendency .",
    "if the particle has radius @xmath242 and has saturn ring director configuration the external field with value @xmath243 makes hedgehog configuration to be stable .",
    "so it s possible to switch between saturn ring and hedgehog configurations in the nematic cell with help of the electric ( magnetic ) field . of course our speculations here",
    "are just _ a hypothesis _ and there should be experimental or computer simulation test to check quantitatively the relation ( [ asf ] ) .",
    "in this paper we propose the green function method which enables to describe quantitatively elastic colloidal interactions between axially symmetric particles confined in nematic cell under the action of the external electric ( magnetic ) fields .",
    "the current method is the generalization of the method proposed in @xcite for description of the colloids in confined nlc .",
    "general formulas for dipole - dipole , dipole - quadrupole and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions in the homeotropic and planar nematic cells with parallel and perpendicular field orientations are obtained .",
    "we consider cases of homeotropic as well as planar nematic cells and have found some new results :    1)we propose _ a criterion _ between radius of the particle and cell thickness when the saturn ring configuration becomes stable ( for particle radius more than @xmath121 ) in the nematic cell in comparison with point hedgehog configuration and generalize this criterion on the case of the applied field in the planar cell .",
    "of course this criterion is not an exact result but rather an estimate which comes from analogy between exact results - for unlimited nlc with external field and results for confined nlc with- and without external field .",
    "it should be tested with computer simulations or experiments .",
    "\\2 ) _ deconfinement effect _ for dipole particles in the homeotropic nematic cell with negative dielectric anisotropy @xmath0 and perpendicular to the cell electric field when electric field is approaching it s frederiks threshold value @xmath1 .",
    "this means cancellation of the confinement effect for dipole particles ( in @xcite the confinement effect was found for quadrupole particles ) near the frederiks transition while it remains for quadrupole particles .",
    "the same effect takes place in the planar cell with @xmath5 , @xmath244 and in the planar cell with @xmath0 , @xmath245 .",
    "\\3 ) new effect of _ attraction and stabilization _ of the particles in the homeotropic nematic cell along the electric field parallel to the cell planes when nematic dielectric anisotropy is negative @xmath0 .",
    "the minimun distance between two particles depends on the strength of the field and can be ordinary for @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ rho ] ) .",
    "\\4 ) attraction and repulsion zones for all elastic interactions are changed dramatically under the action of the external field .",
    "especially when the electric field @xmath7 is parallel to the planar cell planes and perpendicular to the rubbing direction @xmath98 and nlc has negative dielectric anisotropy @xmath0 .",
    "the electric field widens lateral tails of the dipole - dipole interaction with increasing of the strength value @xmath226 ( see fig . [ ddmany ] ) .",
    "but there is the critical value @xmath227 ( @xmath158 ) at which a collapse of the lateral tales into dumbbell - shaped region occurs ( compare fig .",
    "[ dfbelow ] and fig .",
    "[ dfabove ] as well as fig .",
    "[ qqbelow ] and fig .",
    "[ qqabove ] ) .",
    "particles repel inside the dumbbell - shaped regions and attract outside of them ( see fig .",
    "[ dfabove ] ) . so that the attraction in the perpendicular to @xmath228 direction occurs at @xmath246 .",
    "subsequent increasing of the field strength @xmath226 compresses dumbbell - shaped regions and makes perpendicular attraction more significant .",
    "the same situation takes place for quadrupole - quadrupole interaction ( see figs . [ qqbelow],[qqabove],[qq2 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that the same collapse and origin of the dumbbell - shaped regions occurs at the same field strength @xmath227 as for the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we hope that listed above results may be tested either with help of computer simulations or experimentally and would be helpful in further investigations of fascinating world of colloids in liquid crystals .",
