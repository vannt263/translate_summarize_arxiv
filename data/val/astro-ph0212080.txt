    "the @xmath1 @xmath0-ray telescope detected around 300 sources at energies above 100 mev , the majority of which remain unidentified ( hartman et al .",
    "large error boxes on the order of @xmath2 across make unambiguous identifications on the basis of source position difficult .",
    "timing observations allow definitive identifications for sources showing aperiodic ( such as active galactic nuclei ) or periodic ( pulsars ) variability . between 6 - 8 pulsars",
    "have been positively identified in the @xmath1 data by epoch folding on the known period determined from radio or , in the singular case of geminga , x - ray data ( thompson et al 1999 , kaspi et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "several other energetic pulsars were found to be coincident with unidentified @xmath1 sources , but folding the sparse @xmath0-ray data using contemporaneous radio ephemerides did not yield significant detections ( fierro , 1995 ) .",
    "although @xmath3 , when it flies in 2006 , may be able to discover new pulsars just by searching the @xmath0-ray data , it is likely that a priori knowledge of a pulse period will in many cases prove crucial in determining which @xmath0-ray sources are pulsars .",
    "since the effective end of the @xmath1 mission and the publishing of the third @xmath1 catalog ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , there have been both new wide scale pulsar surveys and searches of potential @xmath0-ray counterparts which have yielded several new , energetic young pulsars positionally coincident with unidentified @xmath1 sources . the most productive effort has been the parkes multibeam survey ( manchester et al .",
    "manchester et al .",
    "( 2002 ) list six energetic pulsars from the pm survey which are contained within @xmath1 positional error boxes . for two of these ,",
    "psr j1016@xmath45857 and psr j1420@xmath46048 , previously obtained x - ray and radio data identified potential pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) ( camilo et al .",
    "2001 , roberts , romani , & johnston 2001 ) .",
    "hence , searches directed at the potential counterparts would have been successful . in a third case , psr j1015@xmath45719 ,",
    "very little is known about any potential x - ray or radio pwn . in the last three cases ,",
    "neither radio nor x - ray data show clear evidence for a potential source counterpart .",
    "psr j1837@xmath40604 is on the edge of a bright molecular cloud , making detection of a radio pwn difficult ( damico et al .",
    "a 10 ks _ chandra _ image of the region shows no evidence for a x - ray point source associated with the pulsar to extremely low flux levels ( roberts et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the last two parkes multibeam pulsars , psr j1413@xmath46141 and psr j1412@xmath46145 , are located within the bright energetic supernova remnant g312.4@xmath40.4 .",
    "_ chandra _ imaging and radio spectral tomography of the region show neither point sources nor potential pwn associated with either pulsar ( doherty et al . in press ) .",
    "the low spin - down luminosity , large distance , and alternate potential source of @xmath0-rays ( the supernova remnant ) all argue against either of these latter two pulsars being the true counterpart of the coincident @xmath1 source .",
    "deep pulse searches of potential x - ray and radio counterparts have also recently proven successful . the extremely energetic pulsar psr j2229",
    "+ 6114 was discovered with the lovell telescope at jodrell bank in a 1.5  hr observation of a potential pwn identified by x - ray and radio imaging of the associated @xmath1 error box ( halpern et al .",
    "an @xmath5 x - ray image of the unidentified source gev j2020 + 3658 , associated with the cos b source 2cg 075 + 00 , showed a point - like x - ray source at which the very small ( @xmath6 ) arecibo beam could be directed .",
    "the young pulsar psr j2021 + 3651 , at a 20  cm flux of only 0.1 mjy , was discovered as a result ( roberts et al .",
    "this flux is about a factor of two below the sensitivity limits of the parkes multibeam survey and similar to the sensitivity limit of a 5  hr observation with parkes .",
    "thus , it is possible that deep searches of potential counterparts contained within the parkes multibeam survey region will yield further candidates .",
    "however , three likely pwn identified by roberts , romani , and kawai ( 2001 ) were searched with 5  hr pointings at parkes and failed to yield any good candidates .",
    "two of these , the rabbit and gev j1809@xmath42327 , are almost certainly pwn , based on their x - ray and radio properties ( roberts et al .",
    "1999 , braje et al .",
    "therefore , more sensitive radio searches might be necessary to detect the pulsars these contain .",
    "the third source , gev j1825 - 1310 is less clear of a pwn candidate , due to its large size and the confused radio emission in the region , but other source classes for hard , extended x - ray sources seem less plausible .    between the parkes multibeam survey and directed searches , six new strong @xmath0-ray pulsar candidates",
    "have been discovered as radio pulsars since the demise of @xmath1 .",
    "since these are young pulsars , which tend to glitch , extrapolating ephemerides back to the @xmath1 era is uncertain making detection of @xmath0-ray pulsations difficult .",
    "i list these pulsars in table 1 in boldface .",
    "the dispersion measure ( dm ) distances , determined using the new cordes and lazio ( 2002 ) ne2001 model , are given .",
    "the @xmath0-ray efficiencies , @xmath7 , are determined from the 100  mev to 10  gev flux , assuming the dm distance and 1 steradian beaming .",
    "all of the new pulsars have high dms and have 20  cm fluxes @xmath8 mjy .",
    "the inferred @xmath0-ray efficiencies are also quite high . for comparison , table 1",
    "lists the values for the known @xmath0-ray pulsars , using the ne2001 distances for consistency and adapting the efficiencies from the values given by kaspi et al .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray sources associated with these new pulsars are nearly 100% pulsed , as are the known sources , then the oft - noted inverse correlation of efficiency with spin - down power ( @xmath9 , eg .",
    "zhang & harding 2000 ) and characteristic age , @xmath10 , is not well supported .",

    "in addition to the galactic plane population , there is at least one distinct population of unidentified @xmath0-ray sources at mid - galactic latitudes .",
    "some authors have modelled these as a gould belt ( a local region of recent star formation ) population plus a galactic halo population ( grenier 2001 ) .",
    "it has also been noted that the distribution is similar to that of the millisecond pulsars ( romani 2001 ) . a population of older , geminga - like pulsars has been postulated , as well as a population of @xmath0-ray emitting millisecond pulsars .",
    "indeed , there has been a recent claim of a marginal detection of pulsed @xmath0-rays in the @xmath1 data set from the millisecond pulsar psr j0218 + 4232 ( kuiper et al . 2000 ) .",
    "practically speaking , because the mid - latitude sources are generally weaker and have steeper spectra than the galactic plane sources , they will be difficult to identify if they are not pulsed or have some other characteristic variability . if some fraction are pulsars , then a priori knowledge of the pulse period may be crucial to finding the pulsations at @xmath0-ray energies even with the large effective area of the @xmath3 mission .",
    "we have begun a survey of the unidentified mid - latitude @xmath1 sources that are observable by the parkes telescope . with the multibeam system ,",
    "a series of four pointings in the standard tesselation pattern can completely cover most @xmath0-ray error boxes out to the 95% confidence contour .",
    "alist of 56 sources from the 3rd @xmath1 catalog at latitudes @xmath16 have been selected on the basis of their error box size and lack of probable agn counterpart .",
    "four 35  min pointings using a time resolution of 0.125  ms cover each of the error boxes .",
    "in order to be sensitive to millisecond pulsars in tight binaries , a full acceleration search will be performed using the presto software package ( ransom 2001 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of this survey will be similar to that of the pm survey , and much greater than the highly successful mid - latitude surveys with parkes , which generally use only 4 min .",
