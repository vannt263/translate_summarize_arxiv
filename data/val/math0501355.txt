    "we begin with a kleinian group , @xmath0 , a discrete group of mbius transformations .",
    "we can think of this group as acting on the closure of hyperbolic three space .",
    "that is , on the union of @xmath1 hyperbolic three space and its boundary , @xmath2 the complex sphere .",
    "in addition to stabilizing each of these , the group naturally stabilizes certain subdomains and closed subsets , yielding a number of different quotient surfaces and manifolds .",
    "some of these quotients have conformal structures and others hyperbolic structures .    if the group is a fuchsian group , it fixes both the interior and the exterior of a disc in the complex plane , and a corresponding hyperbolic plane lying over the disc .",
    "the limit set of the group is contained in the circle separating the discs in the plane . in this case there are additional quotient surfaces to consider and certain symmetries within the quotients or among the quotients .",
    "kleinian groups whose limit sets are proper subsets of @xmath2 and fuchsian groups whose limit sets are proper subsets of the boundary of their invariant disc are known as `` groups of the second kind '' . in this paper , we consider only finitely generated groups of the second kind that are also free groups . for such groups , we find the relations between all of these quotients and the relations between the various hyperbolic and conformal metrics that can be placed on these spaces .",
    "the quotient surfaces include the nielsen kernel , the fuchsian quotient and its schottky double .",
    "there is also a nielsen double .",
    "the schottky double is the boundary of the quotient three manifold .",
    "for a two generator fuchsian group ( of the second kind ) we prove that the boundary of the convex core of the three manifold is the image under a pleating map of the nielsen double .",
    "that is , we find the fuchsian group that uniformizes the nielsen double and use it to obtain an isometric map from the nielsen double to the boundary of the convex core of the manifold .",
    "this map is a pleating map .",
    "we are interested primarily in the case where the groups are two - generator groups . for these groups (",
    "when they are free and discrete ) the quotient three manifold is a genus two solid handlebody and its boundary is a hyperelliptic riemann surface . in this case",
    "we generalize the notion of a hyperelliptic riemann surface to a `` hyperelliptic '' three manifold .",
    "we show that the handlebody has a unique order two isometry fixing six unique geodesic line segments , which we call the _ weierstrass lines _ of the handlebody .",
    "the weierstrass lines are , of course , the analogue of the weierstrass points on the boundary surface .",
    "further , we show that the manifold is foliated by surfaces equidistant from the convex core , each fixed by the isometry of order two . the restriction of this involution to the equidistant surface fixes six _ generalized weierstrass points _ on the surface . in addition , on each of these equidistant surfaces we find an orientation reversing involution that fixes curves through the generalized weierstrass points .",
    ".1 in the organization of the paper is outlined in the table of contents below .",
    "we begin with basic definitions and notation .",
    "we then define the various quotient spaces of the kleinian group ; that is , the fuchsian surfaces , the schottky and nielsen doubles , the handlebody and the convex core .",
    "it turns out that there is a natural dichotomy based on whether the axes of the generators are either disjoint or intersect .",
    "we carry out our discussion in two parallel parts ; in part 1 , we state and prove all our results in the disjoint axes case and in part 2 we do the same for the intersecting axes case .",
    "we let @xmath0 be a finitely generated discrete group of mbius transformations .      a fractional linear transformation or a mbius transformation is a conformal homeomorphism of @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "we let @xmath6 be the group of mbius transformations .",
    "we also consider elements of @xmath7 , the group of anti - conformal mbius transformations .",
    "these act on @xmath2 as fractional linear transformations sending @xmath8 .",
    "we use the upper - half - space model for @xmath9 .",
    "if the coordinates for euclidean three - space are @xmath10 , then @xmath11 ; the plane with @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "a euclidean sphere whose center is on @xmath2 , intersects @xmath2 in a circle and @xmath1 in euclidean hemisphere whose _ horizon _ is that circle .",
    "inversion in such a euclidean sphere fixes @xmath1 .",
    "it also fixes @xmath2 and its restriction to @xmath2 has the same action as inversion in the horizon .",
    "we include euclidean planes perpendicular to @xmath2 as spheres , thinking of them as `` spheres '' through @xmath14 ; the horizon of such a plane is a straight line or `` circle '' through @xmath14 on @xmath2 . with this convention the terms _ inversion _ and _ reflection _ are used interchangeably .",
    "the action of elements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 on @xmath1 is related to the action on @xmath2 as follows : each element of @xmath6 can be factored as a product of reflections in circles lying in @xmath2 and its action on @xmath2 is the restriction to @xmath2 of the product of reflections in the euclidean hemispheres whose horizons are these circles .",
    "there is a natural metric on @xmath1 , the hyperbolic metric , preserved by these reflections .",
    "products of even numbers of reflections are the orientation preserving isometries for this metric and the hyperbolic metric is the unique metric for which @xmath6 is the full group of orientation preserving isometries .",

    "the hyperbolic metric in @xmath1 restricts to a metric on @xmath19 and orthogonal projection from @xmath21 ( or @xmath20 ) with this metric to @xmath17 ( or @xmath22 ) with the usual hyperbolic metric @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) is an isometry .",
    "we use the notation @xmath25 to denote the reflection in @xmath26 mapping @xmath2 to itself and @xmath27 to denote the reflection in @xmath19 mapping @xmath1 to itself .",
    "we remind the reader that elements of @xmath6 have both an algebraic classification by their traces , and corresponding geometric classification according to their action on @xmath1 or @xmath2 .    in this paper , we are concerned with finitely generated free groups that are subgroups of @xmath6 .",

    "the context will make clear which axis we mean .",
