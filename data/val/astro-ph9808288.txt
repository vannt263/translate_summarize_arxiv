    "there are a number of studies claiming that dust in foreground galaxies has a substantial effect on the colours and counts of optically - selected quasars ( ostriker & heisler 1984 ; heisler & ostriker 1988 ; fall & pei 1992 and wright 1990 ) .",
    "it is estimated that at least 50% of bright quasars at redshifts @xmath0 may be obscured by foreground galactic dust and hence missing from optical samples .",
    "these studies assumed that dust was confined only within the visible extent of normal massive galaxies .",
    "however , distant populations such as faint field galaxies and quasars may also be observed through foreground diffuse dust distributions . such distributions may be associated with galaxy clusters and extended galactic haloes .    a truly diffuse , intergalactic dust component is ruled out based on the counts of quasars and reddening as a function of redshift ( eg .",
    "rudnicki 1986 ; ostriker & heisler 1984 ) .",

    "studies have shown that possible reddening from uniformly distributed igm dust is limited by observations of radio - selected quasars . since radio - selected quasars",

    ".   for optical depths @xmath45 , the factor @xmath46 in equation ( [ nlost ] ) is of order unity .",

    ", we see that when @xmath55 , ie . @xmath56 ( or when @xmath57 ) , the obscuration will start to approach its maximum value and remain approximately constant as @xmath58 .",
    "we conclude that when dust becomes diffuse and extended on a scale such that the mean optical depth @xmath12 through the distribution satisfies @xmath59 , where @xmath15 is the cumulative luminosity function slope of background sources , obscuration will start to be important and is maximised for @xmath60 . the characteristic spatial scale at which this occurs will depend on the dust mass through equation ( [ to ] ) . for the typical grain values in equation ( [ to ] ) , this characteristic radius is given by @xmath61 the simple model in figure [ nlostrgal ] shows that the obscuration of background sources due to a normal foreground galaxy will be most effective if dust is distributed over a region a few times its optical radius",
    ". this prediction may be difficult to confirm observationally due to possible contamination from light in the galactic absorber . in the following sections",
    ", we explore two examples of possible ` large - scale ' diffuse dust distributions that can be explored observationally .",
    "a number of studies have attributed the existence of large deficits of background sources behind nearby galaxy clusters as due to extinction by dust .",
    "bogart & wagner ( 1973 ) found that distant rich abell clusters were anticorrelated on the sky with nearby ones .",
    "they argued for a mean extinction of @xmath62 mag extending to @xmath63 times the optical radii of the nearby clusters .",
    "boyle et al . ( 1988 ) however claimed a @xmath64 deficit of background quasars within @xmath65 of clusters consisting of tens of galaxies .",
    "these authors attribute this to an extinction @xmath66 mag , and deduce a dust mass of @xmath67 within 0.5mpc of the clusters .",
    "romani & maoz ( 1992 ) found that optically - selected quasars from the vron - cetty & vron ( 1989 ) catalogue avoid rich foreground abell clusters .",
    "they also found deficits of @xmath64 out to radii @xmath68 from the clusters , and postulate a mean extinction , @xmath62 mag .",
    "the numbers of background sources behind clusters is also expected to be modified by gravitational lensing ( gl ) by the cluster potential .",
    "depending on the intrinsic luminosity function of the background population , and the limiting magnitude to which the sources are detected , gl can cause either an enhancement or a deficit in the number of background sources .",
    "the gl effect has been used to explain various reports of overdensities of both optically and radio - selected quasars behind foreground clusters ( bartelmann & schneider 1993 ; bartelmann et al . 1994 ; rodrigues - williams & hogan 1994 ; seitz & schneider 1995 ) .",
    "the reported overdensities for _ optically - selected _ qsos are contrary to the studies above where anticorrelations with foreground clusters are found .",
    "these overdensities however are claimed on angular scales @xmath69 from the cluster centers , considerably larger than scales on which most of the underdensities have been claimed , which are of order a few arcminutes .",
    "one interpretation is that dust obscuration bias may be greater towards cluster centers due to the presence of greater quantities of dust . on the other hand , the reported anticorrelations on small angular scales",
    "can perhaps be explained by the optically crowded fields , where qso identification may be difficult . at present , the effects of clusters on background source counts still remains controversial .",
    "more direct evidence for the existence of intracluster dust was provided by hu et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and hu ( 1992 ) who compared the ly-@xmath2 flux from emission line systems in `` cooling flow '' clusters with balmer line fluxes at optical wavelengths .",
    "extinctions of @xmath70 mag towards the cluster centers were found , in good agreement with estimates from the quasar deficits above .",
    "intracluster dust has been predicted to give rise to detectable diffuse ir emission ( eg . dwek et al .",
    "the most extensive search was conducted by wise et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who claimed to have detected excess diffuse 60 - 100@xmath71 m emission at the 2@xmath72 level from a number of rich abell clusters .",
    "they derived dust temperatures in the range 24 - 34 k and dust masses @xmath67 within radii of @xmath73mpc .",
    "recently , allen ( 1995 ) detected strong x - ray absorption and optical reddening in ellipticals situated at the centers of rich cooling flow clusters , providing strong evidence for dust .",
    "these studies indicate that intracluster dust is certainly present , however , the magnitude of its effect on producing background source deficits remains a controversial issue .",
    "in this section , we give some predictions that may be used to further constrain cluster dust properties , or help determine the dominant mechanism ( ie . gl or extinction )",
    "by which clusters affect background observations .",
    "x - ray spectral measurements show the presence of hot , metal enriched gas in rich galaxy clusters with @xmath74 solar metallicity .",
    "this gas is believed to be both of galactic and primordial origin ( ie .",
    "pre - existing igm gas ) , with the bulk of metals being ejected from cluster galaxies ( see sarazin 1986 for a review ) .",
    "ejection from galaxies may occur abruptly through collisions between the cluster galaxies , ` sudden ' ram - pressure ablation , or through continuous ram - pressure stripping by intracluster gas ( eg . takeda et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the lack of significant amounts of dust ( relative to what should have been produced by stellar evolution ) and interstellar gas in cluster ellipticals provides evidence for a mass loss process . on the other hand , in ellipticals that avoid dense cluster environments , significant quantities of neutral hydrogen , molecular gas and dust",
    "have been detected ( eg .",
    "lees et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "if the dust - to - gas ratio of intracluster gas in rich clusters were similar to that of the milky way , then a radial gas column density of typically @xmath75 with metallicity @xmath76 would produce an extinction @xmath77 mag .",
    "this however is much greater than the value observed .",
    "the likely reason for the deficiency of dust in the intracluster medium is its destruction by thermal sputtering in the hot gas , a process which operates on timescales @xmath78 yr , where @xmath79 is the gas density and @xmath80 the grain radius ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "dust injection timescales from galaxies is typically of order a hubble time ( eg .",
    "takeda et al . 1984 ) and",
    "hence , grains are effectively destroyed , with only the most recently injected still surviving and providing possibly some measurable extinction .",
    "the spatial distribution in dust mass density remains a major uncertainty .",
    "a number of authors have shown that under a steady state of continuous injection from cluster galaxies , destruction by thermal sputtering at a constant rate , and assuming instantaneous mixing with the hot gas , the resulting mass density in dust will be of order @xmath81 ( eg . dwek et al .",
    "1990 ) where @xmath82 is the injected dust - to - gas mass ratio , assumed to be equal to the mean value of the galactic ism , @xmath83 ( pei 1992 ) .",
    "according to this simple model , the dust mass density is independent of gas density and position in the cluster .",
    "if we relax the assumption of instantaneous mixing of dust with the hot gas however , so that the spatial distribution of gas is different from that of the injected dust , the radial distribution of dust can significantly differ from uniformity throughout a cluster .",
    "such a non - uniform spatial dust distribution may be found in clusters exhibiting cooling flows . if , as suggested by fabian et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , most of the cooled gas remains cold and becomes molecular in cluster cores , then a relatively large amount of dust may also form , resulting in a dust distribution which peaks within the central regions .",
    "we explore the radial dependence of extinction optical depth through a cluster , and the expected deficit in background sources by assuming that dust is diffusely distributed and follows a spatial density distribution : @xmath84^{-n},\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is a characteristic radius which we fix and @xmath86 is our free parameter . equation ( [ rhodr ] ) with @xmath87 is the usual king profile which with @xmath88mpc , represents a good approximation to the galaxy distribution in clusters .",
    "thus for simplicity , we keep @xmath85 fixed at @xmath89mpc and vary @xmath86 .",
    "to bracket the range of possibilities in the distribution of intracluster dust , we consider the range @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 corresponds to the simple case where @xmath92constant , which may describe a situation where injection of dust is balanced by its destruction by hot gas as discussed above .",
    "the value @xmath87 assumes that dust follows the galaxy distribution .",
    "this profile may arise if grain destruction by a similar distribution of hot gas were entirely absent .      to model the spatial distribution of optical depth",
    ", we assume that intracluster dust is distributed within a sphere of radius @xmath93 . the central dust mass density @xmath94 in equation ( [ rhodr ] )",
    "is fixed by assuming values for the total dust mass @xmath95 and @xmath93 such that @xmath96 we assume a cluster dust radius of @xmath97mpc , which represents a radius containing @xmath98 of the virial mass of a typical dense cluster characterised by galactic velocity dispersion @xmath99 ( sarazin 1986 and references therein ) .",
    "we assume that the total dust mass within @xmath97mpc is @xmath100 .",
    "this value is consistent with that derived from extinction measures by hu , cowie & wang ( 1985 ) , ir emission detections by wise et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and theoretical estimates of the mean intracluster dust density as given by equation ( [ rhodust ] ) .",

    "boyle et al . 1988 ) , and that implied by the balmer decrements of hu et al . ( 1985 ) .",
    "for a fixed dust mass of @xmath108 however , we can achieve larger values for the central optical depth by steepening the radial dust - density distribution profile , determined by the slope @xmath86 in equation ( [ rhodr ] ) .",
    "figure [ clusters]a shows the optical depth as a function of projected cluster radius for the cases @xmath91 , 0.5 , 1 , and 1.5 .",
    "the case @xmath109 approximately corresponds to the model of dwek et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , which included effects of mild sputtering by hot gas in order to fit for the observed ir emission from the coma cluster .",
    "as shown , the case @xmath91 ( @xmath110constant ) predicts that the dust optical depth should be almost independent of projected radius @xmath101 . within all projected radii , the optical depths predicted by our diffuse dust model lie in the range @xmath111 .",
    "turning back to the discussion of section  [ scale ] where we show that background obscuration by diffuse dust reaches its maximum for @xmath112 , these optical depths satisfy this condition for @xmath113 , typical of luminous background galaxies and quasars .",
    "we now explore the effects of these models on background source counts as a function of projected cluster radius .",
    "we first give an estimate of the projected radius at which the numbers of background sources lost from a flux - limited sample is expected to be a maximum .",

    "these predictions can be compared with a number of existing studies of the observed two - point angular correlation function between clusters and optically - selected qsos .",
    "this function is usually defined as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the average number of observed cluster - qso pairs within an angular radius @xmath122 and @xmath123 is that expected in a random distribution . for our purposes",

    "the former have been interpreted in terms of extinction by intracluster dust , while the latter with the gl phenomenon . in most cases ,",
    "the reported overdensities are too large to be consistent with gl models given our current knowledge of cluster masses and qso distributions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the studies which have reached the smallest angular scales ( @xmath126 ) are also those in which anticorrelations between qsos and foreground clusters have been reported .",

    "these studies however may not be free of selection effects , such as in the detection of qsos from the visual inspection of objective prism plates . from a cross - correlation analysis of galactic stars with their cluster sample however , boyle et al .",

    "the maximum dust radial extent assumed in our models , @xmath97mpc , corresponds to angular scales @xmath68 at the mean redshift of the clusters ( @xmath127 ) used in these studies .",

    "to explore the effects of a diffuse intergalactic dust component , we need to assume a value for the mean mass density in dust in the local universe .",
    "this density must not exceed the total mass density in heavy metals at the present epoch .",

    "the factor @xmath144 is due to our assumption of a @xmath145 dependence for the dust extinction law .",
    "this arises from the fact that light received in the @xmath36-band corresponds to light of wavelength @xmath146 at redshift @xmath142 , which consequently suffers greater extinction .",
    "although a @xmath145 law is not fully representative of that observed in the galactic ism which includes the strong 2200   feature , this is a good on average ralation for the dust laws in many external galaxies ( eg .",
    "jansen et al .",

    "we now show however that the numbers of sources missing at such redshifts could be significantly greater than that claimed by previous studies which assume all dust to be associated with massive galaxies alone .",
    "if dust to some distance @xmath22 covers an area of sky @xmath154 and hence , has covering factor @xmath155 , the number of background sources lost from a flux - limited sample can be estimated from equation ( [ nlost ] ) . in general , the number of background sources at some redshift lost from an area of sky with dust covering factor @xmath156 will scale as : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the fraction of sources missing per unit area . for a completely uniform dust distribution , @xmath159 , and to redshift @xmath150 , @xmath160 for @xmath54 .    if dust were confined to individual galaxies along the line - of - sight however , their covering factor , assuming they follow a poisson distribution is typically @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the mean number of absorber intersections to redshift @xmath142 : @xmath163\\ ] ] ( see heisler & ostriker 1988 ) .",
    "we have scaled to the nominal parameters assumed in the intervening galaxy model of heisler & ostriker ( 1988 ) ( hereafter ho ) . in this model , we find a covering factor of only @xmath164 to @xmath150 .",
    "we can estimate the mean effective optical depth _ observed _ in the @xmath36-band through an individual absorber to @xmath165 in the ho model by using the formalism of section  [ scale ] . for a _",
    "fixed _ mass of dust , equation ( [ to ] ) implies that the product of the area ( or covering factor ) and optical depth of a dust distribution : @xmath166 , is a constant , depending on grain properties and dust mass alone . using this relation ,",
    "the _ observed _ effective absorber optical depth to @xmath165 in the ho model , @xmath167 , can be estimated by scaling from our values of @xmath168 and @xmath169 above for uniformly distributed dust : @xmath170 using this value , the fraction of background sources missed by obscuration from an individual absorber is ` effectively ' @xmath171 .",
    "combining these results , we find using equation ( [ nlostgen ] ) that the number of sources missing at @xmath165 due to a uniform foreground dust distribution to be greater by a factor of @xmath172 than that predicted by heisler & ostriker ( 1988 ) .",
    "we must note that this estimate makes no allowance for possible evolution in dust content .",
    "effects of foreground diffuse dust on source counts at @xmath173 may be significantly reduced if appreciable evolution has occured .",
    "effects of models where the dust content evolves have been explored by masci & webster ( 1998 )      we conclude that the existence of a significant amount of diffusely distributed dust ( eg . with mass density on comoving scales of order that observed in local galaxies ) can enhance the number of background sources missing in optical samples .",
    "due to its relatively large covering factor , diffuse dust predicts a reduction in optical counts at @xmath173 about three times greater than that claimed by previous studies .",
    "the colours of background sources are not expected to be significantly affected .",
    "this implies that the use of background populations to measure a diffuse igm dust component will be extremely difficult .",
    "in this section , we discuss some further uncertainties and implications regarding the existence of diffuse dust in the universe .    first , the effects of intracluster dust on background sources critically depends on the amount of dust present , and its spatial distribution .",
    "regardless of the mechanism by which grains are injected into the intracluster medium from galaxies , it is possible that a significant fraction are destroyed in the injection process .",
    "significant amounts of hot gas are also believed to exist in the ism of cluster ellipticals ( eg .",
    "forman et al . 1985 ) .",
    "this gas is expected to destroy grains on timescales @xmath174yr ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , much shorter than injection timescales .",
    "such destruction mechanisms can thus prevent the formation of significant quantities of dust .",
    "it is possible that the spatial distribution of intracluster dust is not ` diffuse ' and uniformly distributed , but inhomogeneous .",
    "for example , fabian et al . (",
    "1991 ) propose that if most of the cooled gas resulting from cluster cooling flows remains cold and becomes molecular , then this may provide suitable conditions for large amounts of dust to form .",
    "a clumpy dust distribution that follows cooling flow filaments may result , reducing the effective dust covering factor and hence background source deficit .",
    "these issues need to be addressed before attributing such deficits to extinction by dust .",
    "the existence of a smooth igm dust component also remains a major uncertainty .",
    "due to their deep gravitational potential , margolis & schramm ( 1977 ) showed that it is unlikely for supernovae - driven winds to expel significant quantities of dust from a massive galaxy to large scales . for low mass galaxies",
    "however ( eg . dwarfs ) , babul & rees ( 1992 ) show that this mechanism can be effective .",
    "such systems are believed to comprise a majority of the ` faint - blue population ' which show an excess @xmath175 times that predicted from non - evolving galaxy models for @xmath176 ( eg .",
    "tyson 1988 ) .",
    "simulations based on star - formation rates that assume yields in metallicity from local observations , predict that the amount of metals ( and hence dust , assuming a fixed fraction of metals condense into grains at a constant rate ) produced from such a population will be smaller than local estimates by an order of magnitude ( eg .",
    "white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "if the only source of igm dust was from these ` low - mass ' galaxies , then the total optical depth to @xmath131 would be insignificant , and effects on the background universe would be minimal .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that dust is more effective at obscuring background sources when diffuse or extended .",
    "we find that obscuration of background sources by a given dust distribution with optical depth @xmath38 will be most effective when @xmath112 , where @xmath15 is the cumulative luminosity function slope of the sources .",
    "we have explored the effects of diffuse dust from , first , galaxy clusters and second , from a hypothesised uniform igm component . by assuming different radial dust density profiles in a typical rich cluster , we have predicted the optical depth and background source deficit as a function of projected cluster radius .",
    "these predictions can be compared with future observations to constrain the properties of intracluster dust .",
    "our predicted optical depth measures ( @xmath177 ) satisfy the above criterion ( @xmath112 ) for background luminous qsos and galaxies .",
    "existing studies claiming anticorrelations in the distribution of qsos with foreground clusters down to scales @xmath128 are consistent with a dust density profile that follows the galaxy distribution .    as a further illustration",
    ", we have explored the effects of a diffuse igm dust component with cosmic mass density equal to that observed in local galaxies . assuming this density is constant on comoving scales to @xmath150",
    ", we find a deficit in background sources about three times greater than that predicted assuming dust in normal galaxies alone .",
    "the ` diffuseness ' of the dust is the key parameter which we claim determines the effectiveness of obscuration of the background universe .",
    "although such dust distributions may be difficult to detect , we must not neglect their possible presence .",
    "further studies of spatial dust distributions , preferably via the counts and colours of background sources will be essential in confirming our predictions .",
