    "@xcite introduced a fundamental stochastic process to solve the problem of particle energization ( heating and/or acceleration ) in space and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "his goal was to resolve the mystery of the stable energy distribution of cosmic rays ( cr ) ( see details in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the core of his idea had a larger impact on non - linear processes in general and has been the driving force behind all subsequent theories on charged particle energization .",
    "he assumed that high energy particles with speed close to the speed of light collide with magnetic clouds which move in random directions with speed @xmath0 close to the local alfvn speed .",
    "the reflections of the charged particles at the magnetic clouds , heat or accelerate the particles to substantial energies .",
    "the rate of the energy gain for the charged particles is proportional to the square of the ratio of the magnetic cloud speed to the speed of light @xmath1 .",
    "a more realistic proposal was put forward initially by @xcite .",
    "the magnetic clouds were replaced by a kolmogoroff spectrum of * low amplitude mhd waves * and the energization processes was called * `` stochastic heating and acceleration by ( weak ) turbulence''*.    research on reconnecting magnetic fields has undergone a dramatic evolution recently due mostly to the development of the numerical simulation techniques .",
    "long current sheets or multiple interacting current sheets will form , on a short time scale , a turbulent environment , consisting of a collection of current sheets @xcite , ( see also the recent reviews * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , alfvn waves and large scale disturbances traveling along complex magnetic topologies will drive magnetic discontinuities by reinforcing existing current sheets or form new unstable current sheets ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the goals of this article are to introduce three new and important elements in the current discussion of turbulent reconnection in * large scale systems * : ( a ) the study of the characteristics of the energy gain of individual particles , ( b ) the use of the same framework of global and statistical analysis for two types of scatterers , ( i ) magnetic clouds , which are representative of stochastic energy gain , ( ii ) * unstable current sheets ( ucs ) * , which are representative of systematic energy gain , ( c ) the development of a new method to estimate the * transport coefficients from the dynamics of the interaction of the particles with the scatterers*.",
    "@xcite based his estimates for the proposed acceleration mechanism on several assumptions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the particles move with relativistic velocity @xmath2 and the scatterers ( `` magnetic clouds '' ) move with mean speed @xmath0 much smaller than the speed of light .",

    "with @xmath21 we denote the conditional average that @xmath22 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "fermi reached his famous result by assuming that : ( a ) the particles reach a steady state before escaping from the acceleration volume and ( b ) the energy diffusion coefficient approaches zero asymptotically for the relativistic particles and the acceleration is mainly due to the systematic acceleration term ( @xmath23 ) . based on these assumptions , the stationary solution of eq .",

    "we will expand the initial fermi model in this article , by replacing the scatterers by randomly distributed ucs , which represents the environment present in turbulent reconnection in a fragmented large scale system .",
    "in several recent articles the 3d evolution and the fragmented ucs has been analysed ( see @xcite ) , using particle in cell numerical codes , and it has been found that the curvature drift competes with the electric field in the efficiency of particle acceleration inside the ucs .",
    "it will be a natural continuation of the work presented here to study also the curvature drift case , here we focus on the acceleration by the electric fields .",
    "the particle dynamics inside the ucs is complex since internally the ucs are also fragmented and the particles that interact with the fragments of the ucs can lose and gain energy on the microscopic level of description . yet , on the average and over the entire simulation domain , the particles gain energy systematically before exiting the ucs , see fig .",
    "6(c ) of @xcite and the related discussion .",
    "the energy gain is a weak function of energy in the case of electric field acceleration and proportional to the energy in the case of curvature drift . in this article",
    "we estimate the * macroscopic * energy gain by the simple formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the measure of the effective electric field of the ucs , and @xmath30 is the fluctuating magnetic field encountered by the particle , which is of stochastic nature , as related to the stochastic fluctuations induced by reconnection .",

    "the particles move in a random direction after interaction with the scatterers , being always confined to follow the grid - lines .",
    "it is to note that the consequent large angle scattering takes place in position space , and not in velocity space , the large angle scattering is unrelated with the particle energy , and its role is to implement a spatial random walk process on a grid that basically is influencing only the timing of the energization process .",

    "our main contribution in this article is the estimate of the transport coefficients from the particle dynamics and their use in solving the fp equation .",
    "our main results from this study are : ( a ) stochastic fermi accelerators can reproduce a well known energy distribution in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas , where heating of the bulk and acceleration of the run away tail co - exist .",
    "the density of the scatterers plays a crucial role in controlling the heating and the acceleration of particles .",
    "( b ) the transport coefficients show a general power - law scaling with energy .",
    "( c ) the replacement of the scatterers with ucs has several effects on the energization of the particles : ( i ) the acceleration time is an order of magnitude faster than in the stochastic fermi process .",
    "( ii ) estimating the transport coefficients from the dynamic particle orbits , we have shown that the final energy distribution can not be a solution of the fp equation , since the orbits of the energetic particles in energy space depart radically from brownian motion , showing characteristics of levy flights .",
    "( iii ) the asymptotic distribution of the accelerated particles is similar to the ones obtained in different simulations ( see @xcite ) , where turbulent reconnection is established .",
    "we can conclude that the stochastic fermi acceleration and turbulent reconnection processes can play a crucial role in many astrophysical plasmas and their role depends strongly on their physical properties , such as the nature of the scatterers ( e.g.  large amplitude alfvn waves or ucs ) , their spatio - temporal statistical properties ( e.g.  their spatial density ) , and the time evolution of the driver of the explosions .",
