    "one of the hard open problems in engineering is the upscaling of large numbers of _",
    "dislocations_. dislocations are defects in the crystal lattice of a metal , and their collective motion gives rise to macroscopic permanent or _",
    "plastic _ deformation .    for systems of millimeter - size or larger",
    "there is a fairly complete theory of macroscopic plasticity , in which dislocations are not modelled explictly ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for smaller systems , however , the so - called _ size effect _",
    "@xcite suggests that it is necessary to take the distribution of dislocations into account . in this point of view the size effect",
    "arises when the length scale of the system becomes similar to the typical scale at which the _ dislocation density _ varies .    to address these small - scale effects a number of competing ( mainly phenomenological ) _ dislocation density models _",
    "have been derived by upscaling large numbers of dislocations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the unknowns in this type of model are various types of dislocation densities , whose evolution in time is described via conservation laws equipped with constitutive laws both for the velocity of the dislocations and for their interaction .",
    "the use of densities ( as opposed to keeping track of the behaviour of each dislocation ) seems reasonable , since the typical number of dislocations in a portion of metal is huge .",
    "for topological reasons dislocations are _ curves _ in three - dimensional space , and therefore the density of dislocations has dimensions of @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "a dislocation density of @xmath12 ( typical for cold - rolled metal  @xcite ) translates into @xmath13 of dislocation curve in a cubic millimeter of metal .",
    "this high number explains the interest in avoiding the description of the individual behaviour of each dislocation , and focussing on the collective behaviour instead .",
    "it also explains the general belief that this should be possible .",
    "the research done here , however , suggests that the situation is more subtle .",
    "it was triggered by the earlier study  @xcite .",
    "the outcome of  @xcite and the results in this paper suggest that the dislocation density alone is _ not capable _ of describing the evolution of large numbers of dislocations . to put it succinctly ,",
    "a density simply does not contain enough information to characterise the behaviour of the system , even in aggregate form .",
    "this is because the density only characterizes the local _ number _ of dislocations per unit area , and needs to be supplemented with more information on their _ spatial arrangement _ in order to give a satisfactory answer .",
    "we show below how this point arises from the results of this paper .",
    "a separate reason for the analysis of this paper is the uncommon form of the energy .",
    "although it is a simple two - point interaction energy in one spatial dimension , the behaviour in the many - dislocation limit does not fit into any of the standard cases as described e.g.  in  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the combination of all - neighbours - interaction ( each pair interaction is counted , regardless of distance ) , and an interaction potential that is globally repulsive .",
    "we consider a system of pure edge dislocations whose dislocation lines are straight and parallel to one another as in  @xcite .",
    "these dislocations can be modelled as points in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the dislocation lines , and this identification has been done systematically in the literature .",
    "the _ slip planes _ are horizontal , i.e.  parallel to the @xmath14-coordinate , which implies that the dislocations can only move in the horizontal direction ( see figure  [ wall ] ) .",
    "in addition , the dislocations are organized in vertical _ walls _ with a uniform spacing of size  @xmath15 ( in @xmath16 ) . in the model below there will be a finite number  @xmath1 of such walls , which each will extend indefinitely in the vertical direction .",
    "the total degrees of freedom of the system are therefore the horizontal positions @xmath17 ( in @xmath16 ) of the walls .",
    "a constant global shear stress forces the walls towards a fixed barrier which is modelled as an infinite wall of pinned dislocations at @xmath18 .",

    "the system is driven by the discrete energy @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 $ ] is the shear modulus , @xmath27 $ ] the length of the burgers vector , @xmath28 $ ] the poisson ratio of the material , and @xmath29 $ ] the imposed shear stress .",
    "the ( dimensionless ) interaction energy @xmath30 is @xmath31 and its derivative is the ( dimensionless ) force exerted by a wall on another wall at distance @xmath32 , @xmath33    @xmath34 [ tr ] at 170 100 @xmath32 at 345 -10 @xmath35 [ tl ] at 180 220 @xmath36 [ bl ] at 240 20    .,width=384 ]    the first term in the discrete energy @xmath37 in is fully repulsive : each pair of walls repels each other , with a potential that diverges logarithmically as the walls approach each other ( see figure  [ plotv ] ) .",
    "the second term of the energy , accounting for the global shear stress , drives the walls to the left .",
    "the repelling nature of the left barrier is implemented by pinning a wall at @xmath38 .",
    "stationary points of this energy are equilibria of the mechanical system , and under the assumption of a linear drag relation ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.5 ) ) the evolution of the system is a gradient flow of this energy .",
    "although the model is highly idealised , it has a number of properties that make it both interesting and not unrealistic .",
    "the fact that multiple dislocations move along exactly the same slip plane is natural , because of the way they are generated from _ frank - read sources _ ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , although the assumption of an arrangement in equispaced vertical walls is clearly an idealisation , it is on the other hand not unrealistic since equispaced vertical walls are minimal - energy configurations .",
    "walls of edge dislocations are locally stable , in the sense that if one of the dislocations deviates from its wall position , either horizontally or vertically , it experiences a restoring force from the other dislocations that pushes it back .",
    "finally , the vertical organization in walls is also justified by correlation functions calculated from numerical simulations  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting aspect of this model is that existing , phenomenological dislocation - density models can be applied to it to give predictions of the upscaled behaviour  which can then be tested against the rigorous results of this paper . in section  [ sec : consequences ] we discuss three of these , whose predictions for this system are summarized in table [ table ] :    [ table ]    .various predictions for the limiting behaviour of this system of dislocations .",
    "the system is characterized by the density @xmath39 of dislocations ; @xmath40 is the prediction of the stress field generated by @xmath39 .",
    "parameters have been absorbed into @xmath41 and  @xmath42 for simplicity .",
    "we give a full discussion in section  [ sec : consequences ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     also , we write e.g. @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 , since the latter is ambiguous when  @xmath45 has an atom at zero",

    ". then @xmath55 the second term on the right - hand side converges to zero since @xmath52 , and the first is bounded by @xmath56 and therefore also converges to zero .    with this notation",
