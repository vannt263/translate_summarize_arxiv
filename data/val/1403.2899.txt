    "in this paper , we study an analog of the periodogram for extremal events . in classical time series analysis ,",
    "the periodogram is a method of moments estimator of the spectral density of a second order stationary time series @xmath0 ; see , for example , the standard monographs brillinger  @xcite , brockwell and davis @xcite , grenander and rosenblatt @xcite , hannan @xcite , priestley @xcite .",
    "the notions of spectral density and periodogram are the respective frequency domain analogs of the autocorrelation function and the sample autocorrelation function in the time domain . in the context of extremal events , these notions are not meaningful since second order characteristics are not suited for describing the occurrence of rare events .    however , davis and mikosch @xcite introduced a time domain analog of the autocorrelation function , the _ extremogram _ for rare events .",
    "for an @xmath1-valued strictly stationary time series @xmath0 and a borel set @xmath2 bounded away from zero , _ the extremogram at lag @xmath3 _ is given as the limit @xmath4 this definition requires that the support of @xmath5 ( here and in what follows , @xmath5 denotes a generic element of any stationary sequence @xmath0 ) is unbounded and , more importantly , that the limit on the right - hand side exists . in general",
    ", these limits do not exist .",
    "a  sufficient condition for their existence is _ regular variation _ of all pairs @xmath6 or , more generally , _",
    "regular variation of the finite - dimensional distributions _ of the process @xmath0 . a  precise definition of regular variation will be given in section  [ subsecregvar ] .",
    "since @xmath2 is assumed to be bounded away from zero , the probabilities @xmath7 converge to zero as @xmath8 .",
    "then the following calculation is straightforward for  @xmath2 : @xmath9 ^ 2}{p(x^{-1 } x\\in a)(1- p(x^{-1 } x\\in a ) ) } \\\\ & = & \\lim_{{x\\to\\infty } } p\\bigl(x^{-1 } x_h\\in a \\mid x^{-1 } x_0\\in a\\bigr)=\\rho_{a}(h).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for fixed @xmath10 , @xmath11 constitutes a strictly stationary sequence .",
    "the limit sequence @xmath12 inherits the property of correlation function from @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , in an asymptotic sense , one can use the notions of classical time series analysis ( such as the autocorrelation function ) for the sequences of indicator functions @xmath14 .",
    "of course , there are several crucial differences to classical time series analysis .    *",
    "the notion of autocorrelation function is only defined in an asymptotic sense . * the strictly stationary sequence of indicator functions @xmath15 depends on the threshold @xmath10 , that is",

    "the convergence in the mean square sense of such an analog of the classical periodogram estimator towards the spectral density @xmath20 at a fixed frequency @xmath21 was shown in @xcite .",
    "however , the periodogram of @xmath11 used in @xcite had to be truncated to achieve consistency ; the truncation level depended on some mixing rate which is unknown for real - life data . in this paper",
    ", we overcome this inconvenience .",
    "in addition , we study the periodogram ordinates of the indicator functions at finitely many frequencies .",
    "we show that the limiting vector of the periodogram ordinates at distinct fixed or fourier frequencies converges in distribution to a vector of independent exponential random variables .",
    "this property parallels the asymptotic theory for the periodogram of a second order stationary sequence ; see , for example , brockwell and davis @xcite , chapter  10 .    in classical time series analysis ,",
    "the asymptotic independence of the periodogram at distinct frequenc ies is the theoretical basis for consistent estimation of the spectral density via weighted averages or kernel based methods .",
    "we show that weighted average estimators of the periodogram evaluated at fourier frequencies in the neighborhood of a fixed non - zero frequency are consistent estimators of the limiting spectral density .",

    "this property is exploited in section  [ subsecsmooth ] to show that weighted averages of periodogram ordinates evaluated at fourier frequencies in a small neighborhood of a fixed frequency yield consistent estimates of the underlying spectral density at the given frequency . in section  [ sec6 ] , we give a short discussion of work related to the extremogram or the spectral analysis of sequences of indicator functions .",
