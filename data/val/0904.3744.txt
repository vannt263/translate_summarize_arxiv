    "the prototype of instanton in local scalar theories is the classical euclidean solution for a double - well potential , @xmath0 , representing a scalar field rolling between the local maxima of @xmath1 .",

    ", one can understand whether ( i ) the ground state is degenerate or not , ( ii ) tunnel effects can take place between the two localized minima of the potential @xmath2 , ( iii ) such a penetration through the barrier removes the degeneracy of the ground state and what is the splitting , and ( iv ) the system oscillates between the two minima and what is the frequency of the resonant state @xcite .",
    "the same problem is neither trivial nor of mere academic interest as far as non - local theories are concerned .",
    "in fact , the simplest example of a non - local scalar with a static ( _ i.e. _ , zero - momentum ) double - well potential is provided by the tachyon of open string field theory ( osft , reviewed in @xcite ) . in the case of nonchiral bilocal supersymmetric osft @xcite ,",
    "the euclidean @xmath3-level effective equation for a homogeneous tachyon is ( up to a field redefinition ) [ exa ] ( _ t^2-m^2)^-s_t^2=^s_t^2 ^ 2 , where @xmath4 is wick - rotated time and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters fixed by the theory . in the appendix we briefly review how to obtain this equation from the fundamental osft action .",

    "in fact , there exist lorentzian solutions which start from a local maximum and apparently ` climb ' the potential up and down indefinitely @xcite . the same phenomenon was previously noted also for the bosonic cubic potential @xcite .    for certain values of the parameters , a kink solution of eq .

    "its validity and the level of approximation were checked locally via an asymptotic expansion and a matching of the leading coefficients @xcite . here",

    "the result is @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 . to improve this solution one could deform it locally , for instance as done in @xcite , with the requirement that the perturbed solution still obeys the diffusion equation .",
    "we shall not pursue this possibility here .    secondly , the brane tension ratio is about the same as , if not better than , the value obtained in the previous section .",
    "take the lorentzian string action with parameters given in eqs .",
    "( [ kkk ] ) and ( [ solu ] ) , [ eucal2 ] s_*=12g_o^2^p+1x , where now @xmath179 . using the second duplication formula one obtains - & & + + & & 4.517 = 1.017 ( ) .",
    "we conjecture that the exact result is extremely close to the theoretical value , although one should employ a careful numerical procedure ( for instance the iterative method of @xcite ) to evaluate the fully non - local action .",
    "we can summarize the main achievements as follows :    * we have derived approximate duplication formul  which express products and powers of incomplete gamma functions as a single @xmath17 with rescaled arguments .",
    "their level of approximation ( about @xmath117 ) is under control and sufficient to easily construct instantonic tachyon solutions of supersymmetric string field theory , where both the effective kinetic term and potential are highly non - local . * the solution of the euclidean osft problem at lowest - order truncation level with _",
    "local _ potential is the error function @xmath180 . despite the non - locality of the tachyon kinetic term",
    "has been fully taken into account , with respect to the ` local ' instanton there is little quantitative and no qualitative difference in the physics of tunneling events . *",
    "the solution of the exact problem is still the error function , with the same global error .",
    "with respect to the solution for the local potential , the only difference is in the value of the parameters in the equation of motion .",
    "* to the best of our knowledge , _ this is the first time a solution of the non - local effective equation ( [ exa ] ) is found either analytically or numerically_. * interpreted as a spatial kink , the solution in both versions of the theory is a lorentzian soliton and , according to sen s ` second conjecture ' , describes the decay of a non - bps d@xmath181-brane into a codimension-1 bps brane .",
    "this interpretation is fully confirmed by the brane tension ratio we obtained , which is in excellent agreement ( @xmath182 ) with the expected value .",
    "the role of non - locality was essential in the recovery of this result .",
    "( @xmath183 ) in eq .",
    "( [ xxx ] ) one obtains @xmath184 of the brane tension ratio . ]    concerning the last point , the importance of _ lowest - level _ and _ non - local _ solutions has become apparent .",
    "due to technical difficulties , off - shell calculations have been carried out only at lowest truncation level for both the bosonic and supersymmetric string , so that the main effort has been focussed on the effective spacetime action with non - local operators for the tachyon field only .",
    "this is sufficient to describe non - perturbative processes , as the tachyon is the only particle field with negative mass , and it is expected to encode the physics of unstable geometric configurations decaying into different others .",
    "higher - level calculations as well as the recent analytic solutions in the full theory have confirmed that the lowest - level tachyon dynamics captures most of the features of brane decays .",
    "( [ ttt ] ) confirms this statement but adds to it the desirability of taking non - locality fully into account : lowest - order calculations which are on - shell ( i.e. , local ) or quasi - local ( i.e. , truncating non - local operators ) are unable to achieve this degree of accuracy .",
    "we also notice that , for us , the tension of the single branes is unknown and is actually fixed by hand , eq .",
    "( [ fix ] ) .",
    "the ratio of brane tensions , however , is close to the expected value . in other words",
    ", non - locality can tell the difference between brane configurations with very good accuracy , but is insensitive of the properties of the individual branes .",
    "this is expected , as non - local operators govern the relative value of fields @xmath185 and @xmath186 in the equations of motion , but it does not affect the local structure of these equations , which is given by the level approximation . this is why the diffusion equation method plays an important role in the descriptions of the non - perturbative physics of very different in- and out - states .",
    "its applications could be extended to other geometries ( such as lumps of different codimension ) , but only after a spacetime non - local effective action has been constructed .",
    "this latter step is often very non - trivial and must be done with traditional techniques but , once this is accomplished , the rest would be under control .",
    "one of the most remarkable consequence of our procedure is the recovery ` out of the blue ' of the parameters and the physics of osft , eqs .",
    "( [ stv ] ) and ( [ ttt ] ) , for the supersymmetric local potential .",
    "we believe that the rather small difference between the actual values and those of osft is due to the approximation intrinsic of the duplication formula .",
    "this result is highly non - trivial .",
    "the mass and non - local exponent appear as separate inputs in the effective equation of the osft tachyon , although both are determined by conformal invariance .",
    "obviously , a time rescaling can change their ratio , which is precisely the job done by the parameter @xmath13 in our model .",
    "however , their product @xmath187 is independent of @xmath13 and is determined only by the value of @xmath57 , which comes from the scaling formula for a particular type of potential .",
    "it attracts all our attention that the effective equation of the string tachyon with the same values of the coupling constants , as well as the brane descent relation in sen s tachyon condensation , have been obtained starting from an apparently different framework .",
    "in other words , one can pose the question : what is the scalar field theory which describes tunneling between two inequivalent vacua and whose solutions obey the diffusion equation ?",
    "the answer , surprisingly , is : the euclidean tachyonic sector of open string field theory .",
    "the fact that string field theory may be viewed as a diffusing system was already pointed out in @xcite , where tachyon solutions of osft and boundary string field theory were mapped onto each other .",
