    "nickelates is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator .",
    "most of the re nickelates undergo a temperature - driven first order metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , from a high temperature paramagnetic ( pm ) metal to a low temperature afm insulator , at a particular temperature t@xmath2 , which increases systematically with decrease in the atomic radii of the rare - earth ions  @xcite . amongst the nickelates , the most technologically relevant material till date ,",
    "is lanio@xmath3 . in recent years",
    "it has become a popular choice as an electrode , especially for ferroelectric thin film devices including ferroelectric capacitors and non - volatile memories  @xcite . also from the structural point of view , it differs from other members of the same series : while other members have orthorhombic structure , lanio@xmath3 has a rhombohedral symmetry , described by r@xmath4c space group .",
    "the metal - insulator transitions seen in other nickelates are structurally correlated with the crystal tolerance factor @xmath5 which is defined as the ratio between the r - o and ni - o bond distances .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is one for an ideal cubic structure and less for the distorted ones  @xcite . among all the re nickelate compounds , lanio@xmath3 has the maximum tolerance factor with @xmath60.94  @xcite , and hence the least distorted crystal structure .",
    "as we move from la , pr , nd to eu , y compounds , the radius of the rare - earth atom decreases , and to accommodate the size - mismatch in the unit cell , the nio@xmath7 octahedron tilts  @xcite . the tilting is minimum for the first few nickelate compounds ( la , nd , pr ) and the structural distortion is claimed to have minimum effect on their electronic properties . on the other hand , for the re ions with smaller radii , the distortion may have some role to play in the metal - insulator transitions they exhibit .",
    "hence the claim that the mit ( or its absence , in case of lanio@xmath0 ) is primarily dictated by the electronic correlation vis a vis bandwidth  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models and phenomenological insights developed till date deal mostly with lanio@xmath0/laalo@xmath0 superlattice or heterostructures  @xcite . some earlier reports , based on the first - principle density functional theory calculations of the electronic stucture of nio  @xcite and rnio@xmath0 ( r@xmath8na , pr , sm , y , eu , lu and ho ) compounds  @xcite , and the physics behind their metal - insulator transitions , are available . using density functional theory ( dft ) on bulk lanio@xmath0 and its heterostucture with laalo@xmath0",
    ", it was shown  @xcite that the electronic structure changes with the decrease in dimension and strain , and the orbital polarizations in these two cases are just the opposite .",
    "the ground state of lanio@xmath3 is studied here in detail using dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) approximation is used as the impurity solver for the dmft self - consistency equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in the next section , an lcao calculation to model the existing local density approximation ( lda ) density of states ( dos ) used as input to the lda+dmft ( ipt )",
    "is discussed . using the green s function from the lda+dmft calculations ,",
    "the temperature dependent transport properties are calculated . in section * iii * the dmft results are discussed and analysed .",
    "section * iv * is for conclusions .",
    "[ methods and formalism ] while bulk lanio@xmath0 has a small rhombohedral distortion , the band structure of rhombohedral lanio@xmath0 is well explained by the zone folding of a cubic brillouin zone into a rhombohedral brillouin zone  @xcite which , in turn , allows one to adopt a pseudo - cubic notation for studying the electronic structure . an lcao band - structure calculation for the lda density of states",
    "is performed assuming a pseudo - cubic structure , as described in previous reports  @xcite . in the cubic structure",
    "the la atom sits at the corner , ni atom at the body - centre and the o atom at the face - centre positions . in lanio@xmath0",
    "the nominal configuration is ni d@xmath9 with a fully filled t@xmath10 band and a quarter - filled e@xmath11 band  @xcite .",
    "the nearest - neighbour interaction between ni 3d and o 2p orbitals are taken into account .",
    "while @xmath12 bonds are the strongest covalent bonds , resulting from a face - to - face overlap of two atomic orbitals , @xmath13 bonds are much weaker compared to @xmath12 bonds , as they are formed due to a side - by - side overlap of atomic orbitals .",
    "hence only @xmath12 bondings are considered to study the lanio@xmath0 system .",
    "the tight - binding parameters are taken from an earlier report  @xcite .",
    "considering two ni e@xmath11 orbitals and three p orbitals of oxygen atom , a 5@xmath145 lcao hamiltonian was constructed , which in turn gives five energy bands .",
    "this band structure result matches excellently with the one reported earlier  @xcite for the relevant bands near the fermi level ( fl ) .",
    "the lcao dos for the bands closest to the fermi level is calculated . among those five bands ,",
    "two e@xmath15 bands which are closest to the fl and formed out of anti - bonding combination between ni e@xmath11 and o 2p bands , are found out to be degenerate at k=0 point@xcite .",
    "while one band with predominantly d@xmath16 character , is filled with 0.96 electrons , the other one , the nominally d@xmath17 band has a filling of 0.04 electrons@xcite , which once again matches excellently with the earlier report  @xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic lanio@xmath3  @xcite system , with the half - filled e@xmath15 band can be well - described by the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "the single - band half - filled hubbard model is given by @xmath18 where t@xmath19 is the amplitude of hopping of electrons between nearest neighbour sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and u is the effective on - site coulomb repulsion , taken as a parameter with typical values appropriate for re nickelates . the operator c@xmath22 ( c@xmath23 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath12 at the @xmath20-th site .",
    "the dmft results were calculated , using the same half - filled @xmath24 band mentioned above .",
    "the dmft approach is one of the most appropriate techniques to study the strongly correlated systems as it takes full account of local temporal fluctuations .",
    "the essential idea is to replace the lattice model by a single - site quantum impurity problem embeddded in a self - consistently determined bath  @xcite .",
    "it becomes exact in case of large lattice coordination number @xmath25 .",
    "then the hopping term @xmath26 is scaled to @xmath27 to yield a sensible limit  @xcite ; where @xmath28 is the effective hopping integral .",

    "the self - consistency condition in dmft demands that the lattice self energy is same as the impurity self - energy .",
    "so the green s function of the external bath @xmath37 can be obtained from dyson s equation    @xmath38    the newly evolved dynamical mean field would then yield a new self - energy , and hence a new g(@xmath39 )  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistency in dmft ensures that the local component of the green s function coincides with the one calculated from the effective single - site action s@xmath40 , related to the bare green s function  @xcite .",
    "the major simplification in the dmft approach is that the vertex correction is not needed to calculate conductivity and only the elementary particle - hole bubble survives  @xcite .",

    "ipt approximation is used for solving the self - consistent impurity problem .",
    "ipt is one of the most simple yet accurate techniques to study the hubbard model . in ipt",
    "the second order term of the perturbative expansion in u is taken into account and is given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the even and odd matsubara frequencies respectively , and the spectral function  @xcite is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "then the matsubara summation is carried out with the analytical continuation @xmath49 . after calculating the imaginary part of self - energy , the real part",
    "is found out by kramers - kroning transformation .",
    "the angle resolved photo emission spectra ( arpes ) for lanio@xmath0 , are calculated along three different symmetry directions , namely @xmath50x , x - m and m - r directions of the cubic brilloiun zone , using the dmft spectral function .",
    "arpes is one of the most powerful methods to study the electronic structure of a solid . for strongly correlated systems",
    "it is very effective in elucidating the connection between electronic and magnetic properties of a solid and effects of correlation thereon .",

    "negative pressure can be incorporated easily as well . in reality , such negative pressure is applied through substitution by atoms of larger radii . for each value of pressure corresponding bandwidths were calculated , which in turn changed the hopping parameters and hence the band structure that goes in to dmft input . since lanio@xmath0 is always metallic , the effect of negative pressure to search for mit is studied and is shown in fig .",

    "[ conclusion ]    in summary , the transport calculations of the strongly correlated metallic lanio@xmath0 system is done in detail , using a single - orbital dmft approach .",
    "the anti - bonding e@xmath15 band formed by the overlap between ni-3d and o-2p orbitals seems to be responsible for the conduction mechanism within the solid .",
    "the dmft dos at the fermi level remains finite even for a large coulomb interaction .",
    "the non - vanishing dos at the fermi level , even at reasonably large correlation , explains the metallic nature of the system .",
    "the resistivity data clearly show a t@xmath70 dependence on temperature which indicates that lanio@xmath0 is a fermi liquid as also reported earlier  @xcite , with a correlation driven enhanced effective mass of electron .",

    "we have also performed a dmft calculation on ndnio@xmath0  @xcite and found a metal - insulator transition at around u=3.2 ev .",
    "this remarkable difference of fate of the two almost similar compounds appears to be driven by the competition of correlation and bandwidth played out subtly and owes its origin to the dynamical correlations beyond a static mean - field theory .",
