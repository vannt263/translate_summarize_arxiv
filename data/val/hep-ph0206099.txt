    "extra dimensions provide a theoretically and phenomenologically interesting avenue for addressing the planck - weak hierarchy problem @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the randall - sundrum ( rs1 ) proposal based on warped compactifications @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the rs1 vacuum is a compact slice of ads@xmath2 , @xmath3 where the extra - dimensional interval is realized as an orbifolded circle of radius @xmath4 .",
    "the two orbifold fixed points , @xmath5 , correspond to the `` uv '' ( or  planck ) and `` ir '' ( or `` tev '' ) branes respectively .",
    "in warped spacetimes 5d mass scales do not directly correspond to 4d mass scales in an effective 4d description , rather the relationship depends on location in the extra dimension through the warp factor , @xmath6 .",
    "this allows large 4d mass hierarchies to naturally arise without large hierarchies in the defining 5d theory , whose mass parameters are taken to be of order the observed planck scale , @xmath7 gev .",
    "for example , the 4d massless graviton mode is localized near the uv brane @xcite while higgs physics is taken to be localized on the ir brane . in the 4d effective theory one then finds @xmath8 a modestly large radius can then accommodate a tev - size weak scale .",
    "such a value of the radius can be naturally stabilized using the goldberger - wise ( gw ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "there is a striking associated phenomenology of tev - scale kaluza - klein ( kk ) graviton resonances since their wave functions are also localized near the ir brane @xcite .    the ads / cft correspondence @xcite casts further light on the rs1 mechanism @xcite .",
    "effective gravitational field theories in ads@xmath2 encode the constraints of _ four - dimensional _ conformal field theory ( cft ) ward identities and unitarity , the ads@xmath2 loop expansion encodes the constraints of a large-@xmath9 expansion for the cft , while basic cft data , such as the scaling dimensions of the most relevant operators , are encoded in the 5d masses and couplings of the ads@xmath2 theory .",
    "this is quite analogous to the manner in which chiral lagrangians for pions encode the general constraints of chiral symmetry ( breaking ) and unitarity in a transparent and useful way . in terms of the correspondence",
    ", the rs1 scenario can be viewed as an effective description of a strongly - coupled 4d large-@xmath9 theory coupled to 4d gravity , which is nearly conformal over the planck - weak hierarchy . for phenomenological purposes however , it is more useful to employ the ads@xmath2 picture .",
    "quantum loops in warped spacetimes are rather subtle because they are non - local , and as they span the extra dimension are sensitive to greatly varying 4d mass scales . however",
    ", their effects can be important to compute , for instance in considering radiative stability of radius stabilization @xcite or in studying grand unification in the rs scenario @xcite . in a future paper @xcite",
    "we will further the exploration of grand unification in the rs context . in the present paper",
    "we study the loop computation of particular relevance to grand unification , namely the one - loop correction to the effective 4d gauge coupling when bulk gauge fields and bulk charged matter are incorporated into the model @xcite . while this paper was in preparation",
    ", reference @xcite appeared which has some overlap with our results .",
    "we restrict attention to the effective 4d gauge coupling at energies below the lightest kk mass ( @xmath10tev ) .",
    "we verify that the effective 4d gauge coupling robustly contains a logarithmic sensitivity to the 4d planck scale , `` as if '' it had been run down from that scale within a purely 4d renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "all detailed phenomenological issues will be postponed until reference @xcite . for previous phenomenological studies of bulk gauge fields in rs1 ,",
    "see references @xcite .",
    "several of the results derived here have appeared earlier @xcite .",
    "we have tried to give a rather complete treatment here , as simple as possible consistent with rigor and independence of numerical analysis , and we have specified the parametric size of corrections to our approximations .",
    "the rs1 effective field theory is of course non - renormalizable , or more accurately it must be renormalized order by order in the derivative - loop expansion .",
    "we discuss how this is done in detail in our one - loop calculation .",
    "we employ a manifestly 5d gauge - invariant and generally covariant uv regulator , namely pauli - villars , as previously used in reference @xcite .",
    "we use a 5d position space analysis to straightforwardly understand the structure of the local uv divergences on the branes and in the bulk by relating them to the much simpler case of flat space compactifications .",
    "this was also discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "renormalization to this order is straightforwardly accomplished .",
    "the dominant contributions to the finite parts of our calculation are then deduced within a mode analysis by careful consideration of the kk spectrum .",
    "while our focus is on a particular bulk loop we believe that our methodology has broader applicability .",
    "finally , we discuss the cft interpretation and compatibility of our loop - computation as subleading large-@xmath9 corrections , in particular , the logarithmic sensitivity to the 4d planck scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we detail the simple model to be studied , namely scalar qed in the bulk . in section 3 we review the classical approximation to this model and its cft interpretation . in section 4",
    "we give a 5d position space analysis of uv divergences and renormalization .",
    "section 5 contains a summary of the finite pieces in the 4d effective gauge coupling , followed by a detailed derivation using kk mode analysis and the results of section 4 .",
    "section 6 discusses the cft interpretation of the rs1 loop corrections .",
    "the central results of our paper are contained in eqs .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) , ( [ 0modeloop ] ) , ( [ resultm50 ] ) , ( [ resultm5ltk ] ) and ( [ resultm5gtk ] ) .",
    "we will consider the simplest model which allows us to focus on one - loop radiative corrections to the @xmath0 effective gauge coupling . for this purpose we can fix spacetime to be a non - dynamical background of rs1 form ,",
    "( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the gauge theory we consider is 5d scalar qed with a scalar mass @xmath11 .",
    "we will study this case in this paper because scalar loops are technically more transparent than loops of higher spin particles .",
    "brane - localized charged fields are omitted in this paper ; their loop effects are straightforward to compute .",
    "the dominant part of the action is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 has dimension ( mass)@xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we will take @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be orbifold - even while @xmath18 is taken orbifold - odd .",
    "in addition we can add brane localized terms for our bulk fields , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are small dimensionless couplings .",
    "we will consider them to be perturbations which we take to be of the same order as one - loop processes involving bulk interactions .",
    "thus , working to one - loop order the brane - localized vertices do not appear in one - loop graphs , only in tree - level graphs . for simplicity ,",
    "we omit further potential terms for @xmath17 which would not appear in one - loop graphs .",
    "we will match our @xmath1 model onto a @xmath0 effective theory at a scale provided by the mass of the lightest kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitation .",
    "we will denote this mass scale by @xmath21 , which is @xmath22(tev ) @xcite .",
    "clearly , the scalar does not affect the gauge coupling classically . the gauge field zero - mode appearing in the @xmath0 effective theory",
    "is given by @xmath23 plugging eq .",
    "( [ 0mode ] ) into the action , eqs .  ( [ sbulk ] ) and ( [ sbrane2 ] )",

    "the logarithmic dependence on @xmath28 ( treated as a variable ) is a remarkable feature of the rs1 scenario .",
    "for example , _ flat _ extra dimensions do not automatically possess this feature ( however see the proposal of @xcite ) : in flat @xmath1 , we also get @xmath29 , but unlike in rs1 , @xmath4 has no relation with the planck - weak hierarchy .",
    "( [ 0modetree ] ) , though the result of 5d classical physics , looks like a quantum gauge coupling in a purely 4d theory which has been run down from a planckian value , @xmath30 , with a renormalization group equation , @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the running appears to stop at a tev threshold , with a threshold correction @xmath33 .",
    "note that the @xmath34-function coefficient , @xmath35 , necessarily has an infrared - free sign and that this would happen whether the bulk gauge field was non - abelian or abelian ( as it is here for the sake of simplicity ) .",
    "these observations are not coincidental , but are in accord with the ads / cft correspondence @xcite applied to the rs1 scenario @xcite .",
    "the cft interpretation of the rs1 model with bulk gauge field is indeed a purely 4d theory consisting of a strongly - coupled large-@xmath9 cft .",
    "the conformal invariance is not exact , the central deformations being that a global symmetry of the cft is gauged by a gauge field external to the cft , @xmath36 , and there is a fundamental charged scalar field , @xmath37 , which has a coupling to the cft at the planck scale of the form , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an irrelevant ( marginal ) cft operator if @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the planckian value of the gauge coupling is @xmath42 .",
    "the cft is also spontaneously broken at the tev scale .",
    "the leading large-@xmath9 effects of this dual cft picture , including the running of the gauge coupling of @xmath16 , are captured by classical effects in the rs1 picture . in particular eq .",
    "( [ 0modetree ] ) describes the running , valid between the planck and tev scales , due to cft charged matter . despite the fact that the cft itself is strongly self - coupled ( although not strongly coupled to the external gauge field ) , the running can be summarized by a single constant , @xmath35 , as is familiar in one - loop perturbation theory . here",
    ", this fact follows directly from the conformal invariance of the charged matter dynamics .",
    "the fact that @xmath35 has infrared - free sign ( whether or not @xmath16 is abelian or non - abelian , so long as the rank of the gauge group is fixed in the large-@xmath9 limit ) follows from the fact that the charged matter comes in complete large-@xmath9 representations which always overwhelm asymptotically free contributions to @xmath35 . at the tev threshold where scale invariance is broken",
    ", there is a threshold correction to the gauge coupling @xmath43 .",
    "note that although the cft interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ 0modetree ] ) is the gauge coupling at momenta @xmath44 tev , the @xmath45 dependence one would expect from @xmath17 loops ( if the @xmath17 mass is tuned to be sufficiently small ) is absent .",
    "this is because @xmath17 loops are subleading in the large-@xmath9 expansion , while the classical approximation in the rs1 scenario corresponds to leading order .",
    "that is , in large-@xmath9 the external gauge coupling is scaled to be of order @xmath46 so that running only arises above @xmath10tev where this suppression is compensated by large-@xmath9 multiplicities .",
    "below @xmath10tev the dual of our rs1 theory has at most a single charged scalar and so there is no multiplicity enhancement .",
    "we will see the running effects due to @xmath17 loops when we include subleading large-@xmath9 effects , corresponding to loop effects in our model .",
    "we now turn to these rs1 loop effects .",
    "the most straightforward way to understand the divergence structure of the one - loop vacuum polarization is to view the feynman diagrams in position space .",
    "they can be formally expressed in terms of the @xmath17-propagator , @xmath47 .",
    "it satisfies the defining equation , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dalembertian in the 5d warped background , subject to the orbifold boundary conditions , @xmath50 recall that we are taking brane - localized terms to be negligible within one - loop diagrams .",
    "the feynman diagrams can only diverge when the initial and final points in a propagator coincide in the feynman position - integral .",
    "thus all divergences must be local and must correspond to either local bulk terms or local brane terms . to determine what the relevant local divergence structures are it is useful to use the fact that for short - distance propagation in the vicinity of divergences the finite ads radius of curvature is irrelevant and therefore the propagators can be approximated by their flat space equivalents . for bulk divergences",
    "we need only consider the 5d gauge theory in 5d minkowski spacetime , while for brane - localized divergences we need only consider orbifolds of 5d minkowski spacetime . once the flat space divergences are determined their warped equivalents are obtained by inserting the metric dependence using general covariance ( also see the discussion in reference @xcite ) .",
    "it is simpler to euclideanize the whole problem and replace 5d minkowski space by 5d euclidean space , where the bulk propagator ( away from any orbifolds ) is @xmath51 for short distances .",

    "the pauli - villars regularization cuts off these divergences as well and gauge invariance again forces the quadratic divergences multiplying @xmath67 to vanish , leaving only a logarithmic divergence multiplying @xmath68 .",
    "technically , cubic and quadratic divergences require three regulators fields .",
    "however , since these divergences are gauge non - invariant and cancel we need only use a single pv field to regulate the remaining gauge invariant linear and logarithmic divergences .",
    "we will do this from now on .",
    "it is now simple to translate the 5d orbifolded euclidean space divergence structures to the rs1 spacetime . to this",
    "we can add the finite parts of the effective action for the gauge field up to one - loop order .",
    "the result is @xmath69 we have not computed the precise coefficient @xmath70 of the linear divergence because it is highly regularization - scheme dependent . in any scheme",
    "it is a number of @xmath71 , a 5d loop factor .",
    "brane - localized logarithmic divergences are however not regularization dependent since the logarithms must contain finite mass / energy scales in order to balance dimensions .",
    "thus the coefficients must be physical and we have written the results in terms of the @xmath34-function coefficient for purely 4d massless scalar qed , @xmath72 .",
    "( [ effaction ] ) demonstrates that all one - loop cut - off sensitivity can be eliminated by renormalization of couplings we have already included , @xmath73    the only sensitivity to the unknown massive physics represented by the cut - off is parameterized by these renormalized values .    in _ flat _",

    "we can now write a general form for the one - loop corrected gauge coupling in the effective 4d theory below @xmath21 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is finite as @xmath79 .",
    "this limit is a reasonable approximation since we are considering @xmath80 .",
    "we now turn to calculating the dominant behavior of @xmath78 .",
    "since it is finite , we can no longer use 5d locality and the simplifications of relating ads@xmath2 locally to 5d minkowski space .",
    "therefore it is no longer profitable to use a position space analysis .",
    "instead we make use of the kk decomposition of all states to exploit the preserved 4d poincare symmetry of the rs1 background .",
    "to calculate the renormalized gauge coupling in the 4d effective theory at one - loop order , we consider the sum of @xmath0 vacuum polarization diagrams with charged ( physical + pv ) kk states in the loop and the zero - mode of the gauge field on external legs ( with @xmath44 tev ) @xcite .",
    "the couplings in each diagram are completely fixed by 4d gauge invariance , and the signs of each diagram fixed by the bose ( fermi ) statistics of the physical ( pv ) charged fields .",
    "thus , only the 4d mass spectrum is needed to compute the diagrams .",
    "there are two potential sources of uv divergence .",
    "each 4d diagram has standard divergences , while there can be a further divergence in the sum over kk towers .",
    "however , these divergences must be cut off by the pv regularization as seen in section [ divergence ] .",
    "the basic idea is to pair up each physical mode contribution with a pv mode contribution : this pair gives a finite one - loop contribution depending only on the masses of the modes .",
    "the fact that pv regularization provides a complete cut - off in position space then implies that the sum over all such pairs also converges .",
    "we first summarize the results for three regimes of @xmath11 : @xmath81(tev ) , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we then derive these results by combining a detailed mode analysis with our earlier study of uv divergences in section [ divergence ] .",
    "while the results are very simple in form ( for example , the terms sensitive to @xmath4 are linear ) , they do not follow entirely from simple general considerations .",
