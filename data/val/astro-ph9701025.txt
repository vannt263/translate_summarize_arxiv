    "despite the successful determination of cepheid distances to several spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster and elsewhere with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , the dispute over the value of the hubble constant is still not settled ( tanvir et al .",
    "1995 ; mould et al .",
    "1995 ; sandage et al .",
    "part of the problem undoubtedly lies with the uncertain peculiar velocity and significant depth , particularly for the late - type galaxies , of the virgo cluster .",
    "these uncertainties are removed if secondary indicators can be used to extend distance measurements directly to more remote and , ideally , more compact clusters . moreover , due to the morphological segregation of early type galaxies towards the cores of clusters , secondary distance indicators based on e and s0 galaxies are preferred .    in this paper",
    "we calibrate the so - called fundamental plane ( fp ) distance indicator ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) in the leo - i   group .",
    "the leo - i  group ( ferguson & sandage 1990 ) is the nearest group of galaxies containing both bright spirals as well as early type galaxies .",
    "the center of the group is defined by the e1 galaxy ngc 3379 and the s0 galaxy ngc 3384 which form a close pair . planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) and",
    "surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) observations ( ciardullo , jacoby , & tonry 1993 ) indicate that the e5 galaxy ngc 3377 is a member of the group , whilst the radial velocity and projected distance of the s0 galaxy ngc 3412 from the core of the group indicate that it too is a likely member ( garcia 1993 ; tanvir 1996 ) .",
    "finally , the s0/a galaxy ngc 3489 is also a possible early - type member of leo - i , however , given its distance from the group center ( @xmath5 ) and its comparatively `` late - type '' properties , we decided _ a priori _ that it should not be included in the construction of the fundamental plane ( see  3 ) .",
    "the fundamental plane is an excellent distance indicator relating distances between e and s0 galaxies particularly in clusters and groups .",
    "the most recent paper on the subject studies the fp for 230 e and s0 galaxies in 11 clusters and groups ( jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1996 ; hereafter jfk ) . for the present work , the important result of that study is the demonstration that a single global fp yields unbiased distance estimates to early - type galaxies in very different environments with a formal intrinsic scatter of 14 % in distance per galaxy .",
    "thus with four early - type galaxies in the leo - i  group we may obtain the zero - point of the relationship to 7% , with the additional uncertainty of the absolute distance to the group .",
    "the distance to leo - i  has recently been measured by cepheids in the spiral galaxies m96 ( tanvir et al .",
    "1995 ) and m95 ( graham et al .  1997 ) , by sbf ( tonry et al .  1997 ; sodemann and thomsen 1995 ; 1996 ) , by the tip of the red - giant branch ( trgb ) in ngc 3379 ( sakai et al .",
    "1997 ) and pnlf in several group members ( ciardullo , jacoby and ford 1989 ; feldmeir , ciardullo , & jacoby 1997 ) .",
    "thus the leo - i  group is an important stepping stone in the determination of the hubble constant .",
    "observations of the 5 e and s0 galaxies in the leo - i  group were carried out in the @xmath6 passbands using the int prime focus camera on 1994 march 14 .",
    "the ccd employed was the thick @xmath7 eev5 chip with 0557 pixels .",
    "conditions were photometric with reasonable seeing of fwhm 13 .",
    "high s / n twilight flats were obtained in the morning and evening and standard stars were observed through the night to determine color terms and photometric zero points .",
    "magnitudes were measured in @xmath8 12 arcsec diameter apertures , similar to those used by landolt ( 1992 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the @xmath9 band data obtained .",
    "the transformation onto the cousins / landolt system was derived from 28 observations of 10 landolt ( 1992 ) fields each of which contains several standard stars .",
    "a total of 86 independent flux measurements went into the derivation of the color term and these are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "as can be seen , the detector and filter used were very well matched to the standard system , as no measurable color term or non - linearity was found for stars over a large color range @xmath10 ( a typical e galaxy has @xmath11 ) .",
    "the rms scatter around the linear fit is 0.02 mag , most of which can be accounted for by known observational errors ( photon noise and ccd read noise ) combined with the quoted uncertainty of the landolt ( 1992 ) magnitudes .",
    "the photometric zero - point was determined from the observations of a subset of 11 standard stars which were interspersed with the galaxy observations .",
    "aperture corrections were determined from the frames out to @xmath8 33 arcsec diameter apertures and were found to be small .",
    "all observations , of both standard stars and target galaxies , were obtained at less than 1.15 air masses .",
    "thus the extinction corrections , for which we used the carlsberg meridian circle value for that night of @xmath12 ( converted from @xmath13 using the standard la palma extinction curve ) , were very small .    on - target exposures ranged from 10 to 40 secs , chosen to ensure that the images did not saturate in the galaxy cores .",
    "two or three exposures were obtained in each filter for all the galaxies .",
    "surface photometry was performed using the profile fitting software developed by b. thomsen ( sodemann & thomsen 1994 , 1995 ; hjorth et al .",
    "a mean growth curve in circular annuli was derived from a 6th order harmonic expansion fit to each galaxy in 40 rings , equidistant in @xmath14 . for the small galaxies the sky value was determined from the corners of the frames and so gives precise total magnitudes and effective radii for these galaxies . for large galaxies we assumed that the density asymptotically goes as @xmath15 ( jaffe 1987 ; white 1987 ; tremaine 1987 ; hjorth & madsen 1991 ) in the outer parts . assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio with radius this means that the accumulated luminosity can be estimated as @xmath16 at large radii , where @xmath17 is the sky value .",
    "the value of the scale radius @xmath18 depends on the luminosity profile at smaller radii .",
    "its value is @xmath19 for the model of brainerd , blandford & smail ( 1996 ) and @xmath20 for the hernquist ( 1990 ) model .",
    "the sky value @xmath17 , the total luminosity @xmath21 , and the scale radius @xmath18 were determined from a fit to this equation in the outer parts of the profile ( @xmath22 ; typically 46 @xmath23 in our case ) . finally , the sky subtracted luminosity inside an annulus of radius @xmath23 was determined directly from the image ( central few arcsec ) and fit .",
    "in addition , effective radii were also determined by fitting an @xmath14  law to the surface - brightness profile or by fitting an @xmath14  growth curve to the observed growth curve .",
    "the latter fits were kindly carried out by i. jrgensen to mimic the data analysis of jfk .",
    "for these fits the @xmath14  growth curve was fitted in the range 43 arcsec ( 36 arcsec for the two smaller galaxies ) to an outer radius at which the surface brightness was 25 mag arcsec@xmath24 in @xmath25 .",
    "the errors in the derived effective parameters are entirely dominated by systematic effects arising from the particular assumptions that go into the procedures for their determination .",
    "for this reason formal fitting errors for effective parameters will not be quoted in what follows .      for comparison with jfk , who used velocity dispersions and @xmath26 line indices inside an equivalent circular aperture at coma of 34",
    ", we need to estimate spectroscopic parameters as they would appear in a circular aperture of radius @xmath27 ( for a distance ratio of @xmath28 ) . in principle",
    "this can be achieved by applying aperture corrections to central values , e.g. , from the catalog of mcelroy ( 1995 ) .",
    "such a procedure was followed for the determination of @xmath26 line indices , where we applied an aperture correction of @xmath29 to central values ( jrgensen et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , to evaluate accurate velocity dispersions , which are more critical to the fp analysis , we instead examined recent , high - quality , long - slit spectroscopic data from the literature , as described below .",
    "the effective measured velocity dispersion , @xmath30 , inside a given circular aperture arises as the combined effect of pressure and bulk unresolved rotation . assuming that the true intrinsic velocity dispersion , @xmath31 , is isotropic , the observed velocity dispersion can be expressed as    @xmath32    here @xmath33 is the effective rotation velocity observed along the major axis .",
    "the velocity fields , structure , and inclination of e / s0 galaxies are in general unknown , making @xmath34 uncertain . instead we shall resort to a naive relation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the angle on the sky relative to the major axis . from this",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath37 for an inclined disk one expects that @xmath38 which translates into @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , the inner linear rise of the rotation curve and large ellipticities tend to lower this value .",
    "estimating @xmath34 in a statistical sense using @xmath40 as a measure of the amount of effective kinetic energy prugniel & simien ( 1994 ) found @xmath41 .",
    "jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard ( 1993 ) used @xmath42 in a similar study . for ngc 3379 the available spectroscopy",

    "in this paper  we shall use @xmath46 .",
    "the uncertainty in this quantity is treated as a random ( as opposed to a systematic ) uncertainty since @xmath34 is likely to be different for different galaxies , due to different viewing angles , ellipticities , and internal kinematics .",

    "ngc 3489 also has by far the highest mean surface brightness inside the effective radius , possibly due to recent star formation : ngc 3489 is the only galaxy with clear emission lines , whereas the other four galaxies have genuine early - type spectra ( ho et al .",
    "1995 ) . finally , ngc 3489 has the largest projected distance from the group center and so this galaxy ( if any ) is the most likely to be either in the foreground or background relative to the rest of the leo - i  galaxies . for these reasons",

    "fp distances may be affected by the observed magnitude range , morphological makeup of the sample ( e / s0 ratio ) and environment .",
    "according to jfk , their version of the fp excludes biases above 1% due to magnitude and morphological selection .",

    "figure  3 shows the fp for the leo - i  galaxies with the slopes @xmath133 and @xmath134 fixed at their global values .",
    "the fp offset is computed as the median offset ( jfk ) of the four larger galaxies , the slope being consistent with that found by jfk .",
    "ngc 3489 clearly falls below the line defined by the other galaxies , probably for the reasons discussed above .",
    "we obtain @xmath135 .",
    "other ways of computing the offset , including mean and weighted mean give same result within @xmath136 .",
    "the observed formal rms scatter in @xmath129 is 0.024 or 6 % in @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is significantly smaller than expected from the 14 % intrinsic scatter plus observational errors found by jfk .",
    "another approach would be to consider the zero - point obtained from ngc 3379 alone .",
    "the motivation for this is that ngc 3379 is a bona fide elliptical galaxy , with normal colors , stellar populations ( as witnessed e.g.  by the @xmath26 index ) , small ellipticity , no evidence for an embedded disk ( statler 1994 ) , and a small rotation velocity .",
    "thus it escapes the inherent uncertainty present in the prescription for correction of unresolved rotation ( eq .  2 ) and other possible systematic errors that could arise from using the other , later - type , leo - i  galaxies . in view of the very small intrinsic scatter observed in the fp for the central regions of coma alone ( @xmath137 ) ( jrgensen et al .",
    "1993 ) it is plausible that the intrinsic uncertainty for ngc 3379 alone is significantly smaller than the formal 14 % for the global fp .",
    "the zero point derived for ngc 3379 only is 1.135 with an estimated observational uncertainty of 0.030 .",
    "the final possibility is to treat the departure from the @xmath26@xmath123 relations as an extra parameter .",
    "environment may be important given that leo - i  is a relatively poor group , comparable to the smallest groups studied by jfk .",
    "guzmn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found a correlation of the @xmath26@xmath123 relation with radial distance from the center of the coma cluster , and argued that this was consistent with galaxies in less dense environments having on average younger stellar populations .",
    "this allowed guzmn and lucey ( 1993 ) to formulate an ` environment - independent ' fp which incorporated an @xmath26 term , evaluated using galaxy evolution models , to correct for this systematic difference .",
    "jfk also identify similar behavior for the @xmath26@xmath123 relation , although they only find a marginal environmental effect of @xmath138 % for distances obtained with their ` classic ' fp over the full range of groups and clusters in their study . including an empirically determined @xmath26 term in the fp should in any case provide some robustness to differences in stellar populations between galaxies , which may in turn vary systematically with environment , whether such differences are due to variations in age or metallicity .",
    "interestingly jfk found that , while the observed scatter in the fp was not significantly reduced with the extra term , it did in some cases bring outliers with discrepant @xmath26 line indices closer to the global fp . for this @xmath26 fp @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    "is added to the rhs of the fp equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the significance of this term is at the 1.52 sigma level ( jfk ) , and it is evident that it brings ngc 3489 much closer to the fp defined by the other four galaxies . for these",
    "we find @xmath142 and an observed formal scatter of 6 % .",
    "we note that , if instead we had used the effective radii and intensities as determined from the fit of @xmath14  growth curves , the corresponding numbers are @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",
    "it is reassuring that the zero points remain unchanged within the uncertainties .    from @xmath146 ( jfk ) and @xmath147 ( i. jrgensen , private communication )",

    "we adopt a value of @xmath154 where we now assume a conservative uncertainty of @xmath155 which is estimated from the expected intrinsic scatter of 14 % in distance per galaxy .",
    "this corresponds to 7 % in the distance ratio .",
    "it should be noted that this uncertainty is much higher than the estimated individual uncertainties and makes the derived distance ratio a robust value .",
    "we thus derive the angular diameter distance ratio of @xmath156 or a luminosity distance ratio of @xmath157 between coma and leo - i .",
    "tanvir et al .

    "for the recession velocity of coma we use @xmath170 ( faber et al .  1989 ) and adopt a conservative estimate of the possible peculiar velocity of @xmath171 ( han & mould 1992 ; bahcall & oh 1996 ) which also allows for the intrinsic substructure in the coma cluster ( colless & dunn 1996 ) . in the terminology of jerjen and tammann ( 1993 ) our result then implies a `` cosmic velocity '' , of leo - i  of @xmath172 . adding the uncertainties in quadrature we arrive at an uncertainty of 12 % in the hubble constant : thus we get @xmath173 fixing to coma .    alternatively , tying leo - i  to the larger frame of all 11 clusters in the sample of jfk , using the observed redshifts in the cmb , yields a mean or median value of about @xmath174 with an rms scatter of @xmath175 .",
    "this value is essentially unchanged if we the exclude the small nearby group doradus and the peculiar cluster s639 ( jfk ) but the scatter is reduced to @xmath176 .",
    "relative to this larger cluster frame , which has a median redshift of @xmath177 , we then find a mean value of @xmath178 and a hubble constant of @xmath3 .",
    "we have not corrected here for the effects of malmquist or incompleteness biases , however these are expected to be small ( @xmath179 % ) given the numbers of galaxies observed in each cluster ( jfk ) .",
    "reassuringly , this `` cosmic velocity '' is fully consistent with that found for the leo - i group by the `` 7 samurai '' of @xmath180 based on the @xmath181@xmath30 relation ( faber et al .",
    ". the higher value of @xmath182 obtained by tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using the sbf method to zero - point the @xmath181@xmath30 relation is explained in part by the calibration : they find a distance of 10.7 mpc for the leo - i  group .",
    "the remaining difference is nevertheless marginally significant given the quoted errors .",
    "this may reflect our smaller sample size ( only four galaxies used in the calibration ) or difficulties in correcting their sample for selection biases .",
    "there is plenty of room for improvement in this approach .",
    "wide - field ccd frames should map the distribution of light in the larger galaxies to get more precise values of the photometric quantities .",
    "however , the largest uncertainty in the fp parameters are the effective velocity dispersions .",
    "long - slit spectra taken in several positions over the galaxy should eliminate this uncertainty . the intrinsic uncertainty in the fp for individual galaxies , including environmental effects ,",
    "should be better understood , possibly by including more information on the stellar population , e.g.  the h@xmath134 line index .",
    "indeed , the most important worry in using the fp as a distance indicator is possible environmental effects . for example , if galaxies in low - density environments like leo - i  have on average younger stellar populations than the dense core of coma ( as discussed by guzmn and lucey 1993 and jfk ) , then our distance to coma obtained from the ` classic ' fp would be an overestimate , although , as we have seen , the use of the @xmath26fp suggests that environmental effects are not large .",
    "it would also be interesting to calibrate the fp in the infrared for several clusters where the scatter may be smaller ( pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1995 ) and the systematic effects of variations in stellar populations less ( guzmn and lucey 1993 ) .",
    "the uncertainty arising from the coma peculiar velocity should be eliminated by establishing the fp at larger redshifts , @xmath183 .",
    "on the theoretical side the mechanism behind the fp does not seem to be fully understood , although the fp does seem to work as a purely empirical relationship .",
    "after all , the assumption of a ` universal ' fp underlies the distance indicator used in this paper , and although there is observational support for this , a firm theoretical basis for this is clearly needed ( renzini & ciotti 1993 ; hjorth & madsen 1995 ; capelato , de carvalho , & carlberg 1995 ; ciotti , lanzoni , & renzini 1996 ) .",
    "the main result of this paper  is the construction of the fundamental plane ( fp ) of the leo - i  group .",
    "the small observed scatter ( 6 % ) about this relation means that the result is insensitive to the particular choice of and weighting of the galaxy sample .",
    "we have adopted the form of fp determined by jfk and hence find the relative distance between coma and leo - i  to be @xmath184 .",
    "in addition , using the distance to m96 in leo - i  ( @xmath159 mpc ) yields a direct and accurate measurement of the coma distance of @xmath4 mpc .",
    "finally , using the recession velocity of coma ( @xmath185 ) , we estimate the hubble constant to be @xmath173 , or alternatively , if we consider the full cluster sample of jfk , with a median redshift @xmath177 , we find @xmath3 .",
