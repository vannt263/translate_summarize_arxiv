    "to discuss the details of probing hadronic structure in high energy collisions , the intrinsic transverse momentum carried by partons plays an essential role . allowing the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentaion function ( ffs ) to depend additionaly on intrinsic transverse momentum rather than the usual momentum fraction variables will cause the teransverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) factorization formalism go beyond the framework of standard factorization @xcite . to describe the processes which are sensitive to intrinsic parton transverse",
    ", tmd factorization will be needed .",
    "there are large variety of situations which can be considered as an eveidnent to appear the usefulness of the tmd concept .",
    "some examples are drell - yan ( dy ) process , hadron production in electron - positron annihilation at small transverse momentum and semi inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) . in this article",
    ", we are focusing on the dy processes and try to do some phenomenological investigation to extract an improtant parameter in perturbative qcd analysis .",
    "the renormalized strong coupling constant @xmath5 is a crucial quantity in high energy collisions .",
    "equivalently the renormalization group ( rg ) invariant scale parameter @xmath0 is the fundamental qcd scale which is depend on the number of active quark flavour , @xmath6 , and can be extracted using fit to the different experimental data confronted with theoretical predictions .",
    "although lots of works has been done to determine this parameter , it is still of interest to be estimated by other methods and using different available experimental data .",
    "since the drell - yan process is one of the good context to test qcd theory , we choose the available low energy experimental data related to this process to find the @xmath0 parameter by makeing use of collins , sopper and sterman(css ) resummation formalism @xcite which is one of the theoretical framework designed to account for qcd effects .",
    "the fitting is performed at first four mass bins of 5 @xmath2 to 9 @xmath2 of the e288 experimental data .",
    "since the used energy scale , @xmath7 , is more than the mass of bottom quark , five active flavour is considered in our analysis .",
    "totally 28 data points are taken into account to extract @xmath0 in the fit .",
    "the organization of paper is as following . in sec.2",
    "we consider the evolution of tmd pdf which is employed to calculate the cross section in dy process by making use of the collins - sopper - sterman ( css ) approach .",
    "we extend the current results in @xcite and obtain the tmd pdf up to the nnlo approximation . in sec.3",
    "we review the theoretical assumption to calculate the cross section of dy processes in which the brock - landry - nadolsky - yuan ( blny ) parametrization is used for the non - perturbative part of the calculation . using fitting process",
    "the unknown parameter @xmath0 is obtained in sec.4 .",
    "finally we give our conclusion in sec.5 .",

    "matches the tmd pdf to a collinear treatment .",
    "the hard part of this phrase is given by wilson coefficient function , @xmath24 , where it also contains the standard integrated pdf which is denoting a collinear factor .",
    "the second phrase , @xmath25 , of eq.([f ] ) includes exponential functions which are different and all can perturbatively be calculated .",
    "the matching between the small and large @xmath14-dependence is implementing by the third phrase , @xmath26 , of this equation .",
    "the non - perturbative feature , intrinsic to the proton , for large-@xmath14 values is given by @xmath17 function .",
    "on the other hand the non - perturbative behavior of @xmath11 at large values of @xmath14 is presented by @xmath18 .",
    "however the function @xmath17 depends on the external hadron but it can be considered universal . for @xmath18 function",
    "there is different situation in which it is universal and also do not depend on the external types of the hadrons .    to do the calculations , as it is customary , the choose @xmath27 and @xmath28 are applied . in this work ,",
    "we first obtain the tmd pdf of up quark at the nnlo approximation with x = 0.09 for the small @xmath29 , medium @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath2 values .",
    "to do this we use the package of @xmath32 $ ] @xcite which gives us the collinear part of the tmd pdf for a parton of a specified quark .",

    "we depict the related plots run over a range typical for studies of tmd - functions from @xmath46 to 6 gev in fig.1 .",
    "as is expected by increasing the energy scale the effect of tmd pdf at larger values of @xmath47 is growing . by raising the accuracy of calculations and increasing the energy scales , the amount of of tmdpdf at small @xmath47 value is deceasing . in this case",
    "the effect of this function at large values of @xmath47 is slightly extending .",

    "therefor we should include the experimental data for which the transverse momentum distributions have more effect in non - perturbatve part of our calculations .",
    "hence we use the low energy dy data in the region where the transverse momentum of the lepton pair is much smaller than its invariant mass q. the reason is that the css formalism describes the production of dy pairs better in the central rapidity region @xcite .",
    "the e288 data from the @xmath86 process at @xmath87 @xmath2 with @xmath88 is a good case with those properties . by accessing to the tmdpdfs we are able to calculate the related cross section in dy process . using the e288 experimental data ,",
    "we do the fitting and obtain the values of the non - perturbative parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , using the blny parametrization @xcite and finally @xmath0 which is placed in the perturbative part of calculations .",
    "the fitting is done by minuit programming and the results are : @xmath89 @xmath90 which is corresponding to @xmath4 for energy scale of z - mass boson at the nlo approximation .",
    "the goodness fitting with @xmath91 and finding for @xmath0 a value within the acceptable range indicates that the blny parametrization is suitable to describe low energy events .",
    "we use the obtained numerical results for the unknown parameters and plot the related dy cross section .",
    "we then compare the result with the available experimental data and depict them in fig.2 for @xmath86 reaction at @xmath87 @xmath2 with @xmath88 . as can be seen a good consistency",
    "is existing between them .",
    "we considered the evolution of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function for up quark in css formalism up to nnlo approximation which can be easily extended to obtain the tmd pdf for other quarks by similar calculations .",
    "in particular , we have used the tmd evolution kernel at nnlo approximation which to our knowledge , has not been done before .",
    "we also indicated that one can directly relate qcd observables to the underlying dimensional transmutation parameter of the theory , @xmath0 .",
    "we extracted the @xmath0 within the appropriate range of perturbative qcd and showed that the tmd formalism is a powerful tool to analyze perturbative and non - perturbative effects in cross section spectra of dy process .",
    "the result of global fit showed that the blny parametrization is a good one for the non - perturbative part of cross section and the css formalism can formulate and describe properly the e288 experimental data ( for low energy drell - yan process ) .",
    "the calculations for dy cross section can be extended to the nnlo approximation which we hope to report them in our further research activity .",
    "employing the experimental data for dy cross section at high energy scales is also a valuable task to increase the precision of our fitting which can be done in future .",
