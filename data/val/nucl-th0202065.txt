    "pion multiplicity distribution and their associated fluctuation and correlations have been studied at the cern sps @xcite in the past , are being investigated at rhic presently , and in the future will be studied at the lhc . because of the very large number of pions and other produced particles in very high energy collisions , event - by - event studies can be carried out and are important tools for many reasons .",
    "one current reason for studying them resides in the hope that anomalous fluctuations will remain from a transition of a quark - gluon phase to hadronic phase , thus offering one of the signals of the formation of the qg phase .",
    "several models predict large fluctuations such as the disoriented chiral condensate @xcite and in density fluctuations from droplets arising in a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "a well known procedure for studying correlations uses the bose - einstein symmetries associated with pions in a hanbury brown - twiss analysis @xcite .",
    "such an analysis gives information about the space time history of the collision through measurements of source parameters .",
    "if the density of pions becomes large , bose - einstein correlation may also lead to a strongly emitting system which has been called a pion laser @xcite .",
    "the pion laser model has been recently solved analytically by t. csrg and j. zimanyi @xcite .",
    "the importance of bose - einstein correlations has also been illustrated in the observation of a condensation of atoms in a harmonic oscillator or laser trap @xcite .",
    "previous interest in pionic distributions have centered around the possibility of intermittency behavior @xcite and fractal structure based on parallels with turbulent flow in fluids .",
    "a distribution widely used to discuss such features has been the negative binomial ( nb ) distribution @xcite with its associated clan structure @xcite and kno scaling feature @xcite .",
    "kno scaling properties have been interpreted in terms of a phase transition associated with a feynman - wilson gas @xcite .",
    "various other issues associated with pions include evidence for thermalization @xcite , critical point fluctuations @xcite , fluctuations from a first order phase transition @xcite , charge particle ratios and question of chemical equilibrium @xcite , the behavior of fluctuations in net charge in a qg plasma for transition @xcite .    for lower energy heavy ion collisions ,",
    "multifragmentation of nuclei takes place .",
    "the fragment distribution can also be described statistically by considering all the possible partition of @xmath0 nucleons into smaller clusters @xcite .",
    "this study gives a tool for the description of nuclear multifragmentation distributions @xcite , nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite , critical exponent , intermittency , and chaotic behavior @xcite of nuclear multifragmentation .",
    "the same model can describe pionic distribution .",
    "this possibility arises in our approach which is based on feynman path integral methods where symmetrization of bosons or anti - symmetrization of fermions leads to a cycle class decomposition of the permutations associated with these symmetries .",
    "the correspondance comes from the identification of clusters of size @xmath1 and the cycles of length @xmath1 in a permutation as discussed below .    in next section a summary of the generalized statistical model",
    "will be given .",
    "various models of particle multiplicity distribution will then be developed .",
    "moreover , we derive a generalized model which can further be reduced to a geometric , negative binomial , and lorentz / catalan model . these various models used in describing pion and particle multiplicity distributions",
    "then are examined with the generalized model in sect .",
    "iii . in sect .",
    "iv , we further compare various statistical properties between different models within the generalized model .",
    "consider a system composed of @xmath2 different types of species or objects which could be the fragments in a fragmentation or in a cycle class description .",
    "any event of such a system can be associated with a vector @xmath3 or @xmath4 where the non - negative integer @xmath5 is the number of individuals of species @xmath1 . for example @xmath5 can be the number of clusters of size @xmath1 or the number of cycles of length @xmath1 in a given permutation of @xmath6 particles .",
    "the later is important for bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics . a general block picture of @xmath7 is shown in fig.[fig1]a .",
    "fig.[fig1]b shows how the various partition can be developed as an evolution from successively smaller systems .",
    "the multiplicity , i.e. , the total number of individuals is then @xmath8 the number of species @xmath2 can be infinity in general .",

    "issues associated with fluctuations play an important role in many areas of physics and departures from poisson statistics are of current interest .",

    "this study was done using a generalized model based on a hypergeometric series ( hga ) and uses a grand canonical ensemble as its basic framework .",
    "this framework has its origin in a feynman path integral approach and involves a cycle class decomposition of the permutation symmetries that originate from the underlying wavefunctions associated with the produced particles .",
    "many of the existing distributions used in particle phenomenology are shown to be special cases of this more general hypergeometric model .",
    "several quantities are shown to be quite general ; such as heirarchical scaling relations ( eq.([kappan ] ) ) , initially discused in terms of a particular distribution such as the negative binomial distribution .",
    "various models and associated distribution can be developed in a unified way .",
    "these include the poisson distribution coming from coherent emission , chaotic emission producing a negative binomial distribution , combinations of coherent and chaotic process leading to signal / noise distributions and field emission from lorentzian line shapes producing the lorentz / catalan distribution which are all shown to be special cases of the hga model . the hga model and its associated special cases are used to explore a wide variety of phenomena .",
    "these include ; linked pair approximations leading to heirarchical scaling relations on the reduced cumulant level , generalized void scaling relations , clan variable descriptions and their connections with stochastic variables associated with branching processes , kno scaling behavior , enhanced non - poissonian fluctuations .",
    "our results show that even though various distributions have the same mean and fluctuation the distribution itself or the underlying mechanism could be very different .",
    "thus to find the correct distribution and underlying mechanism from the data more informations than just the mean and its fluctuation are necessary .",
    "the model used here , hga , has three parameters , @xmath63 , @xmath55 , and @xmath120 .",
    "thus with a given value of @xmath120 , there is no extra controlling parameter for a given mean and fluctuation .",
    "all the higher moments and cumulants are then determined by the model without any further controling parameter .",
    "further studies of general models having more parameters are needed where the higher moments can be used as extra conditions in comparing various distributions .",
    "we compared various pionic distribution within a generalized hypergeometric model ( hga ) which is a special case of much more general distribution in grand canonical ensemble . in our model",
    "used here for a grand canonical ensemble , the weight factor @xmath21 for each species is the same as the mean number @xmath102 of the species in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "thus we may determine the weight @xmath21 through experimental data .",
    "this result also shows that any power law behavior in @xmath102 is directly related to the power law of @xmath21 .",
    "it is explicitly shown that kno scaling works only for large fluctuations for all the distribution related to the hga model .",
    "comparison within the hga model also shows that just comparing void variables @xmath163 and @xmath165 is not enough to distinguish different models that describing pion data .",
    "thus new parameters have to be found which are quite different between different models . beside mean values and fluctuations",
    "higher order reduced factorial cumulants need also to be evaluated .    in this paper",
    "we have also generalized the poisson transformation and the compound distribution that arises from sequential process .",
    "specifically , the underlying sequential picture involves a two step process where the final distribution arises from the production of clusters followed by a subsequent decay of the clusters . for the hga model , the final distribution",
    "is obtained from compounding a poisson distribution of clusters with a nb distribution coming from the decay of each of the clusters .",
    "the hga may arise through a three step sequential process of poisson - poisson - logarithmic compound distribution .",
    "it is also shown that the hga can arise from a two step sequential process of a nb distribution followed by a new hga with a different mean value .",
