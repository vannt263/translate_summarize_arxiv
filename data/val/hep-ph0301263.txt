    "the behavior of @xmath0 scattering in the limit of high center - of - mass energy @xmath1 and fixed momentum transfer is one of the outstanding open questions in the theory of the strong interactions . in the late 1970s , lipatov and collaborators",
    "@xcite established the papers which form the core of our knowledge of regge limit ( high energy limit ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the physical effect that they describe",
    "is often referred to as the qcd pomeron , with the evolution described by the bfkl equation .",
    "the simplest process where this equation applies is the high energy scattering between two heavy quark - antiquark states , _",
    "i.e. _ the onium - onium scattering . for a sufficiently heavy onium state ,",
    "high energy scattering is a perturbative process since the onium radius gives the essential scale at which the running coupling @xmath2 is evaluated .",
    "this process was proposed as a gedanken experiment to investigate the high energy regime of qcd in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the dipole picture @xcite , the heavy quark - antiquark pair and the soft gluons in the limit of large number of colors @xmath3 are viewed as a collection of color dipoles . in this case",
    ", the cross section can be understood as a product of the number of dipoles in one onium state , the number of dipoles in the other onium state and the basic cross section for dipole - dipole scattering due to two - gluon exchange . at leading order ( lo )",
    ", the cross section grows rapidly with the energy ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) because the number of dipoles in the light cone wave function grows rapidly with the energy .",
    "therefore , in principle , the analysis of the energy dependence of the cross section could disentangle the qcd pomeron effects .",
    "however , for @xmath0 colliders , the study of the qcd pomeron is made difficult by the fact that the cross section is influenced by both short and long distance physics .",
    "only when specific conditions are satisfied is that one can expect to determine the qcd pomeron effects .",
    "some examples are the forward jet production in deeply inelastic events at low values of the bjorken variable @xmath7 in lepton - hadron scattering and jet production at large rapidity separations in hadron - hadron collisions .    over the past few years much experimental effort",
    "has been devoted towards to observe the qcd pomeron in those processes , but the conclusions are not unambiguous ( see e.g. ref .",
    "this fact is mainly associated with the theoretical uncertainty present in the high energy limit of qcd . only recently , after an effort of ten years , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the bfkl equation were obtained ( for a review on nlo bfkl corrections , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , since the bfkl equation predicts that for @xmath8 the corresponding cross section rises with a power law of the energy , violating the froissart bound , new dynamical effects associated with the unitarity corrections are expected to stop further growth of the cross sections @xcite .",
    "this expectation can be easily understood : while for large transverse momentum @xmath9 , the bfkl equation predicts that the mechanism @xmath10 populates the transverse space with a large number of small size gluons per unit of rapidity ( the transverse size a gluon with momentum @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath11 ) , for small @xmath9 the produced gluons overlap and fusion processes , @xmath12 , are equally important . considering this process , the rise of the gluon distribution with transverse momenta below a typical scale , energy dependent , called saturation scale @xmath13 is reduced , restoring the unitarity .",
    "it is important to salient that golec - biernat and wusthoff @xcite have shown that a saturation model is able to describe the desy @xmath14 collider hera data , in particular the transition from the perturbative to the nonperturbative photoproduction region , including the inclusive and diffractive cross sections .",
    "therefore , the description of the qcd pomeron still is an open question , which deserves more detailed analysis .",
    "this situation should be improved in the future with the next generation of linear colliders ( for a recent review of bfkl searches , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "future @xmath15 colliders probably will allow to discriminate between bfkl and saturation predictions @xcite ( for other analysis of photon - photon collisions see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . such reaction presents analogies with the process of scattering of two onia discussed above .",
    "although the onium - onium scattering is a gedanken experiment , off - shell photon scattering at high energy in @xmath16 colliders , where the photons are produced from the leptons beams by bremsstrahlung , plays a similar role .",
    "in these two - photon reactions , the photon virtualities can be made large enough to ensure the applicability of the perturbative methods .",
    "similarly , we can expect to test the qcd pomeron in heavy flavor production in two - photon collisions , where the hard scale is provided by the heavy quark mass .    in the last years",
    "many authors have studied in detail the referred process . from the view of the color dipole picture , in ref .",
    "@xcite the contribution of the dipole - dipole interaction was taken into account considering a generalization of the original saturation model @xcite to the two - photon reactions .",
    "there , the results present good agreement with data from @xmath17 colliders , remaining some room to discuss issues concerning resolved contributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these questions were revisited using the saturation model , where threshold effects were addressed in an accurate way as well as the hadronic single - resolved contribution was computed within the dipole formalism .",
    "a current open question is the discrepancy between the theoretical results and the data on heavy quark production , mostly for the bottom case , in the @xmath18 photoproduction and two - photon reactions .",
    "this feature is also corroborated by the dipole - dipole approach from ref .",
    "@xcite . as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , even the inclusion of resolved contributions does not remove completely the observed deficit .",
    "quite promising results are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where heavy quark production in two photon reaction is calculated within the @xmath9-factorization formalism and the unintegrated gluon density for the photon is determined using the saturation model .",
    "> from the view of the bfkl approach , there are several calculations using the leading logarithmic approximation @xcite and considering the next - to - leading corrections to the total cross section @xmath19 process @xcite . in particular , a stable next - to - leading order program relying on the blm optimal scale setting @xcite has produced good results with opal and l3 data at lep2 @xcite . however , the heavy quark production from real two - photon process is still an open question .",
    "only the effects of charm mass in the @xmath19 total cross section for the kinematical region of l3 at lep was analyzed by bartels et al .",
    "@xcite considering the lo bfkl dynamics .",
    "we address that issue in our analysis , considering a bfkl dipole approximation to the qcd dynamics .",
    "similarly to the previous analysis on two - photon physics , one shows that the next generation of colliders will be able to discriminate the dynamics associated to the qcd pomeron .",
    "recently , we have proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate qcd pomeron effects in a different context , namely in photon - photon scattering at ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions . in this case , the cross sections are enhanced since the @xmath20 luminosity increases as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the atomic number @xcite . there , we have analyzed the double diffractive @xmath23 production in @xmath24 collisions , with the photons coming from the weizscker - williams spectrum of the nuclei .",
    "for that process our results have indicated that future experimental analysis can be useful to discriminate the qcd dynamics at high energies . here",
    "we extend our proposal for heavy quark production . in principle , at ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions , a photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding nuclei can interact with one photon of the other nucleus ( two - photon process ) or can penetrate into the other nucleus and interact with its hadrons ( photon - nucleus process ) .",
    "therefore , heavy quarks can be produced in photo - nucleus interactions as well as photon - photon interactions .",
    "the first case has been extensively discussed in literature @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and recently revised in different approaches @xcite . on the other hand , heavy quark production in two - photon collisions has been discussed essentially in refs",
    ". @xcite . in these analysis ,",
    "the underlying contribution comes from the qed quark - box diagram ( qpm ) at lo [ fig .",
    "[ dipdiagrams ] ( top panel ) ] , which dominates in the available energies at rhic , @xmath25 gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , besides the direct contribution also the resolved contributions were carefully calculated and the latter is shown to be negligible . however , at the lhc experiment , where the two - photon energies can reach to @xmath26 gev , the qcd diagrams become important and the qcd pomeron should dominate in this limit [ fig .",
    "[ dipdiagrams ] ( bottom panel ) ] .",
    "consequently , an enhancement of the cross section associated to the dynamics is expected .",
    "we will address these issues in the section [ hqperipheral ] , complementing the detailed study presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we will restrict our analysis for the two - photon process and its potentiality to investigate the qcd dynamics .",
    "similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , our goal here is twofold : to analyze the potentiality of this process to constraint the qcd dynamics at high values of energy and to provide reliable estimates for the cross sections concerning that reaction .",
    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions are a potentially prolific source of @xmath24 collisions at high energy colliders .",
    "the advantage of using heavy ions is that the cross sections varies as @xmath27 rather then only @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the maximum @xmath24 collision energy @xmath29 is @xmath30 , about 6 gev at rhic and 200 gev at lhc , where @xmath31 is the nuclear radius and @xmath32 is the center - of - mass system lorentz factor of each ion . for two - photon collisions , the cross section for the reaction @xmath33 , where @xmath34 @xmath35 , will be given by @xmath36 where @xmath37",
    ", @xmath38 is the square of the center of mass ( c.m.s . )",
    "system energy of the two photons , @xmath39 of the ion - ion system , @xmath40 is the photon luminosity and @xmath41 is the cross section of the @xmath20 interaction ( for details related to the numerical expressions , see ref .",
    "our approach excludes possible final state interactions of the produced particles with the colliding particles , allowing reliable calculations of ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions .",
    "therefore , to estimate the heavy quark production it is only necessary to consider a suitable qcd model for photon - photon interaction .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ hqphoton ] , we calculate the total cross sections for the process @xmath42 based on the color dipole picture , using the dipole cross section given by the saturation model and bfkl approach . in sec .",
    "[ hqperipheral ] , the corresponding heavy quark cross section in coherent ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions are presented , with a particular emphasis in the lhc energies . in the last section we drawn our conclusions and summarize the main results .",
    "the heavy quark production via photon - photon collision is a powerful process testing the applicability of perturbative qcd methods .",
    "the photon induced reactions have the advantage of being clear concerning the probing structure and the large mass of the heavy quarks produced allows perturbative physics to be employed",
    ". the mechanisms of production of such process have been systematically studied , despite the available data being modest and having large uncertainties ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an important experimental verification is that the data on open heavy quark pair production , mostly for bottom quark , stay above theoretical calculations by a sizeable factor .",
    "such a feature has generated several studies which rely on higher orders in the collinear factorization approach or on the successful results based on the semihard approach .",
    "an important approach describing two - photon process is given by the color dipole formalism @xcite .",
    "the simple physical picture is provided by the photon splitting in a quark - antiquark pair ( virtual components in the transverse plane ) , called color dipole , long after the interaction and the further scattering of these pairs with the target .",
    "such an approach has produced a consistent and unified description of high energy photon induced processes in deep inelastic scattering and two - photon reactions , including the deep inelastic diffractive dissociation .",
    "in particular , in the two - photon interactions , the target is also given by a color dipole .",
    "the wave functions describing the photon virtual fluctuation are completely determined from perturbative methods , whereas the effective color dipole cross section has to be modelled .",
    "it may contain nonperturbative and higher twist contributions as well as parton saturation effects as we should discuss latter on .",
    "the @xmath43 pair production mechanism can be separated into three main contributions : ( i ) the quark box diagram ( qpm ) , with photons coupling to the same heavy quark line , which dominates at not so large photon - photon c.m.s .",
    "energies , @xmath29 [ fig .",
    "[ dipdiagrams ] ( top panel ) ] ; ( ii ) the dipole - dipole interaction , where both photons fluctuate in quark - antiquark pairs and interact through gluonic exchange , which dominates at high energies [ fig .",

    "the first contribution is well known , providing a @xmath48 behavior modulo logarithmic corrections , given by for example on refs .",

    ". however , the qcd pomeron effects can not be disregarded at lhc energies , since the cross sections are enhanced by a factor two for these effects .",
    "moreover , we have analyzed the double charm pair production and verified that the cross section for this process is sizeable , mainly due to the fact that photoproduction background can only be produced by higher - order multiple interactions .",
    "our results motivate more detailed studies .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the mass and transverse momentum distributions could be useful to discriminate between photon - pomeron and two - photon processes .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
