    "as a star ascends the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , its outer atmosphere expands and pulsates , pushing gas away from the star where it can cool and condense into dust grains .",
    "the resulting circumstellar dust shell hides the star in the optical and emits strongly in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "eventually this mass - loss process will eject enough mass to expose the high - temperature core of the star , ionizing the gas inside the dust shell and forcing the transition from an agb star to a planetary nebula .",
    "objects making this transition are in their `` post - agb '' phase ( sometimes referred to as the `` proto planetary nebula '' phase ) .",

    "c modes usually seen at 7.65 and 7.85  here appear redward of 8.0  .",
    "the positions and relative strengths of the pah features have been attributed to the relative dominance of the ionization fraction of the pahs , their composition , their isotopic ratios , their size , and the degree of uv processing they have undergone , to name a few .",
    "@xcite , for example , examined the role of several of these factors in a small sample of lmc hii region spectra and suggested the molecular structure , which influences which c@xmath0c and c@xmath0h modes are present , may control the strengths in the lmc sources .",
    "@xcite found that the relative strengths of the 7.65 and 7.85  features in extended reflection nebulae vary , with the dominant emission shifting from 7.65 to 7.85  as the uv field grows weaker .",
    "@xcite interpreted their pah spectra from herbig aebe ( haebe ) stars similarly .",
    "these spectra are excited by weak uv fields , and the peak component in this region has shifted further to the red , to 7.98.0  .",

    "other characteristics of the pah spectrum from msx smc 029  are consistent with this shift in the c@xmath0c modes .",
    "the entire 79  pah complex is only @xmath24 times stronger than the out - of - plane c@xmath0h bending mode at 11.3  , compared to 830 times stronger in the haebe stars @xcite , indicating that the ionization fraction of the pahs is lower in msx smc 029 .",
    "@xcite studied the pah features in the 1113  region in 16 sws spectra and found that the relative strengths of the solo and trio c@xmath0h out - of - plane bending modes at 11.3 and 12.7  varied with ionization fraction , with more ionized pahs having a stronger trio mode at 12.7  .",
    "they interpreted this result as an indication of pah processing , with more unprocessed pahs having long , regular edges and thus more emission in the solo mode . in msx",
    "smc 029 , the ratio of the 12.7  trio mode to the 11.3  solo mode is at most 0.25 ( using the upper limit at 12.7  ) , as low as any in the sample examined by @xcite .",
    "they also show that this ratio decreases as the ionization fraction decreases .",
    "the pah spectrum of msx smc 029  follows this trend , indicating both a low ionization fraction ( low 79  /11.3  ratio ) and relatively unprocessed pahs ( low 12.7  /11.3",
    "ratio ) .",
    "@xcite recently made the first detections of the polyacetylenic molecules  ( diacetylene ) and c@xmath15h@xmath6 outside the solar system in the very young post - agb objects afgl 618 and afgl 2688 , as well as detecting the more familiar bands of  ( acetylene ) at 13.7  and hcn at 14 .",
    "in msx smc 029 , the  band is the most prominent and easily identified molecular absorption feature .",
    "the limited signal - to - noise ratio and trouble determining a continuum level make extracting other features challenging .",

    "the similarity of the spectra leads us to suggest that the same molecules may be shaping the msx smc 029  spectrum .",
    "the absorption near 16  in msx smc 029  has an additional red component which could be from c@xmath15h@xmath6 as was seen in afgl 618 @xcite .",
    "absorption from the p and r branches of the  feature may affect the appearance of the spectra as well .",
    "the strong mid - ir absorption and non - detection at @xmath16 band , combined with a preliminary model that suggests high visual opacity , imply the presence of very dense material .",
    "this could a residual circumstellar envelope from the agb phase , which would be consistent with the youth of the post - agb object , although such a nebula may require more extreme youth than is likely , or the material could be in the form of a dense disk .",
    "we obtained a 535  low - resolution spectrum from msx smc 029  with the _ spitzer _  irs .",

    "msx smc 029 , like the post - agb objects afgl 2688 and iras 13416@xmath06243 , shows both  absorption at 13.7  and pah emission features .",

    "the shape of the 79  pah complex and the relative flux of the 11.3  feature to that of the 12.7  feature suggest that msx smc 029has a low ionization fraction or unprocessed pahs .",
