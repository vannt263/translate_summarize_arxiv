    "looking at the cygnus constellation , it appears that we are looking down a spiral arm , with gas and young stars distributed at several distances ( from a few hundred parsecs to 1 - 2 kpc and even well beyond ) along the line of sight .",
    "however , establishing the number and location of galactic spiral arms is far from being free of controversy .",
    "the cygnus region is a clear example of this situation .",
    "looking at the galactic longitude @xmath1 80@xmath2 , the line of sight could be either tangent to the local _ armlet _ , or secant to two major arms , depending on the galactic model adopted @xcite .",
    "what is clear is that the cygnus constellation harbours one of the most interesting star - forming complexes , which , together with the carina region , displays the largest surface density of massive stars . in both cases",
    ", we could be looking along a tangent line of a spiral arm .    a proof of this has been reported by @xcite analysing the distance distribution of the stellar population in the m29 cluster area , where the stars are in the field range of between a few hundred parsecs up to more than 2 kpc .",
    "m29 ( ngc 6913 ) forms part of the cygnus ob1 association , which also contains five other young clusters .",
    "this ob association presents a complicated 3d geometry , and of the nine associations forming the cygnus - x region is the one with the largest distance interval along the line of sight .",
    "this is our target object , the cygnus ob1 association , and we will try to analyse the distribution of the stellar population in a subspace of the phase space formed by angular coordinates ( ra , dec ) and radial velocity ( rv ) , studying how many stellar populations with different kinematic behavior can be found in the region , and how these stellar groupings , if any , might be associated with the third spatial coordinate : the distance to the sun .",
    "there are some previous studies about kinematic structure in the rv subspace of stellar systems , for example , for clusters as ngc 2264 @xcite , orion nebula cluster @xcite , gamma velorum @xcite and ngc 2547 @xcite ; and for associations as puppis ob @xcite , perseus ob2 @xcite and cygnus ob2 @xcite .",
    "but these kinds of studies are few due to the lack of precise and complete kinematic data for the clusters as well as the absence of automatic tools specifically designed for the search for kinematic structures .",
    "a good characterization of the phase space is becoming the most reliable tool for detecting and isolating different stellar populations in star systems .",
    "we have recently developed an automatic tool for performing a clustering analysis of the phase space @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will make use of another cluster analysis tool called optics @xcite to look for different phase - space structures in the cygnus ob1 association .",
    "the paper is therefore structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe some previous studies related to the cygnus ob1 association , what kind of data we are using and how they were selected , and the stellar objects in the studied area .",
    "the kinematic structure of this association in the phase subspace is presented in section 3 , while a description of the kinematic populations of this star - forming region is discussed in section 4 .",
    "lastly , the main conclusions of this work are summarized in section 5 .",
    "an ob association is a gravitationally unbound stellar system , containing between 10 and 100 massive stars of early spectral types ( o and b stars ) and possibly hundreds or thousands of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "associations are believed to form within a relatively small region of space inside a giant molecular cloud .",
    "after the removal of gas and dust , the remaining stars become unbound and , in most cases , begin to expand .",
    "the typical age of an ob association is 10 myr , and the typical size is around 80 pc @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the majority of all stars in the milky way were formed in ob associations .",
    "a census of the stellar content of the ob associations within 1 kpc from the sun was presented by @xcite , based on _ hipparcos _ positions , proper motions and parallaxes .",
    "the cygnus - x complex is approximately 10 deg in diameter and is located at an average distance of around 1 kpc , containing several active star - forming regions .",
    "there are nine ob associations listed in the cygnus region , seven of which are likely physically connected to the super bubble centred on the cygnus ob2 association ( galactic longitude @xmath3 ) .",
    "we are interested in studying the cygnus ob1 association , specifically we want to analyse the kinematic structure of the association , which is located at the galactic coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "fig , [ fig : location ] shows two images of the association , in optical ( _ top _ ) and infrared ( _ bottom _ ) taken from the aladin server , where they show the complex structure of the stellar , gas , and dust distributions in the 7.5 degrees size selected area .",
    "@xcite analysed the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the line of sight of the cygnus ob1 association by studying a family of cometary globules ( cgs ) detected by _",
    "spitzer _ .",
    "the cgs family considered could be a remnant of a pillar directed towards the centre of the association .",
    "the pillar is decaying in the process of star formation under the action of ionizing radiation and the wind of the ob stars .",
    "@xcite concluded that a rich ob association can produce a set of expanding shells : a massive slow - expanding one swept up by the stellar winds of massive stars and several fast inner shells produced by the activity of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and , later , by supernova explosions .",
    "they argued that these dynamical structures provide favourable conditions for triggering star formation .",
    "lozinskaya and collaborators @xcite studied the effects of stellar winds on the interstellar medium using h@xmath6 line plus iras and/or co data .",
    "the super shell around the ob associations has the coexistence of bright emission at low velocities with weak high - velocity emission .",
    "the densest clouds of the cygnus ob1 association are at a distance of 1.2 to 1.4 kpc and the density of o - b2 stars has a maximum at the same distance , showing the relation between the dense cloud and the stars .",
    "the high - velocity gas in the slow super shells is accelerated by shock waves generated by the winds from wr stars and by supernovae that interact with the tenuous gas of the inner cavity , which induces a new wave of star formation in the parent molecular cloud .",
    "you can see the hierarchical system of shells for the cygnus ob1 association in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "this figure reveals that the northeastern part of the common shell around the cluster ngc 6913 is greatly attenuated in optical emission and that this dense cloud coincides with the dust lane at a distance of 1 - 1.2 kpc .",
    "moreover , in the southwest part of the common shell around the cluster ic 4996 , there is a deep cavity .",
    "these two boundary regions of the common shell overlap with some cygnus ob9 and ob3 stars .",
    "besides that , there are some small - scale shells around individual wr and of stars .",
    "@xcite carried out a multi - wavelength study about the cygnus complex , in which they found evidence that three molecular clouds in that region are directly shaped by the uv radiation mainly from members of ngc 6913 .",
    "there is a cavity around this object , which was created by radiation and/or stellar wind compression from massive stars in the region .",
    "the super shell surrounding the cygnus ob1 association was studied in the far - infrared wavelength using iras data by @xcite .",
    "they found that the association is well defined covering an area of 2 x 5 degrees and deficient in ir emission with a limb edge and a size of 50 x 130 pc at 1.5 @xmath7 0.3 kpc of distance .",
    "they said that this cavity represents the early stages of a super bubble produced by the winds and supernovae from spatially distributed massive stars .",
    "@xcite studied the periphery of the super shell surrounding the cygnus ob1 association and , specifically , the stellar cluster vdbergh 130 and the ism around it .",
    "they concluded that this cluster is physically connected with the super shell around the association , and that there are some ionized regions of bright mid - ir emission in the vicinity of the object .",
    "they only estimated the minimum colour excess as their study showed a large scatter of colours , as well as the cluster age range of 5 - 10 myr and distance of 1.8 @xmath7 0.3 kpc .",
    "taking into account all the previous studies , we assume a distance between 1 and 1.8 kpc for the cygnus",
    "ob1 association in the following .",
    "we first did a basic search of rv data from the vizier service centred on the cygnus ob1 association ( ra = 304.45 deg , dec = + 37.63 deg ) using a box with a side of 5 degrees .",
    "we have chosen this big area to be sure that the cygnus ob1 association is completely covered , although some contamination from the cygnus ob3 and ob9 associations will be present , since the borders between them are not clear .",
    "we found five independent catalogues : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we downloaded the coordinates ( ra , dec ) , the hd number ( if available ) , the spectral type ( spt ) and the rv value for the stars in each catalogue .",
    "the matching was performed using the hd identification when available or sky coordinates .",
    "we also searched for the rv data of the cluster stars located in the studied area from the webda database ( and their references ) .",
    "we put them together with the vizier stars , generating a file containing all stars in the area , a total of 314 stars . for each star in this file",
    ", we have between one and six rv measurements . due to the differences between the rv values compiled for the same star",
    ", we considered the median of all values as representative of the central rv value for each star . in table",
    "[ tab : data ] we can see the collected rv data and its median value for each star , as well as our identification i d , ( ra , dec , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) coordinates , hd number when available and the name of the cluster hosting the star , if any . we have also attained spt and object types from the simbad database for each star , where they are catalogued as : 75% single stars , 7% binaries , 5% carbon stars , and the remaining 13% are other types such as pulsating , variable , high proper motion , emission - line , blue super - giant or be stars .",
    "the uncertainty of these values is highly variable and , apart from the different internal precision of each catalogue , the larger uncertainty for some rv values is due to the binary character of some objects or to the high rotational velocity of the massive stars .",
    "however , even this high uncertainty that exists in some cases does not hide the great rv dispersion inside this star - forming region , neither its kinematic pattern .",
    "rv @xmath10 -50 km / s . ]",
    "[ 0.95 ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]            we calculate the rv values in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) system for our detected clustering groups using both methodologies , using the solar motion given by @xcite .",
    "the rv difference in the lsr system for our groupings is @xmath11 9 km / s .",
    "if we consider a differential rotation model as the basis of the kinematics of the galactic disc , the distance between the groupings calculated from the difference in velocity is approximately 1.1 kpc .",
    "we wish to stress that the kinematics of a star - formation region like cygnus ob1 are not only governed by the galactic potential but also by the injection of energy and moment caused by the early evolution of massive stars .",
    "therefore , this distance of separation between both kinematic groupings we have calculated may present a high uncertainty and may have been overestimated .",
    "nonetheless , both the photometric distance that we assume ( 760 pc as the difference between the distances of the cluster closer to the centres of groupings ) , and that determined by a galactic rotation model ( 1.1 kpc ) , undoubtedly indicate that both groups are well separated along the line of sight .",
    "thus , the cygnus ob1 association appears to present a ne - sw velocity gradient whose origin allows various hypotheses but whose true nature is unknown for now .",
    "if we compare our results with those previously provided by lozinskaya and collaborators for the ism in the region , they probe to be compatible .",
    "@xcite found an extended and elongated shell and a set of smaller shells inside it , providing a hierarchical scheme of stellar formation with different forming epochs , which @xcite shows in her figure 1 , together with the massive stars positions and the borders between associations cygnus ob1 , ob3 and ob9 .",
    "the biggest cavities detected by them inside the common shell are well defined for the bright emission in @xmath0 and the radio continuum .",
    "specifically , they found two kinematic components : one bright @xmath0 emission with lsr velocities in the range 2 - 20 km / s , and one faint @xmath0 emission with lsr velocities in two separated ranges of velocity , lower than -50 km / s and between 30 and 50 km / s , which correspond with the emission of the extended and common shell , distributed non - uniformly over that .",
    "the two main stellar kinematic groupings detected in this study coincide morphologically with the two principal cavities detected by @xcite in her figure 1 .",
    "the stellar velocities of both groups are approximately within the velocity interval of the intense gas emission ( 2 - 20 km / s ) associated with the cygnus ob1 association , utilising the solar motion given by @xcite , with which we calculate a mean correction to the lsr of @xmath11 14.7 km / s .    finally , we want to note that the analysis using two different clustering techniques leads to the two groupings being formed by a spatial star concentration with a significant rv difference , and well separated in the three spatial dimensions .",
    "thus , the cygnus ob1 association contains at least two clustered stellar populations well separated in a 4d subspace of the phase space .",
    "the skg methodology detects a third grouping whose morphology looks like a filament ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details of the analysed test - cases ) , which lies in the main diagonal form of the cygnus ob1 association ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre ] - _ bottom - right _ ) . the central rv value for this group , which we have called group 3 , is of 27.7 km / s in the lsr system , a value that is close to the range observed by lozinskaya and collaborators for the faint @xmath0 emission of the gaseous component .",
    "it could be representative of high velocity component that @xcite called the model of two kinematic components of the shell structure .",
    "this stellar grouping could be associated with the common shell or the bubble that delimits the borders of the association .",
    "if we assume a hierarchical stellar formation model , this population could represent the oldest population of the association .    moreover , the rv histogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histomedian ] ) shows a tail of negative velocities . if we draw the rv median versus dec ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rvdec ] ) , we can see a weak but significant rv gradient with the declination for rv < -60 km / s .",
    "most of these stars are carbon stars or have high proper motion according to the simbad database and they seem to be associated with the cygnus ob3 association .",
    "although this apparent gradient could be an observational bias due to the complex 3d structure of the interstellar absorption in the region .",
    "the nature of this gradient , and even its very existence , is out of the scope of this paper , but we want to mention this striking observational feature .",
    "the work carried out in this article can be summed up in the following points :    1 .",
    "making use of the radial velocity data available in the literature for more than 300 stars within an area of 5 x 5 square degrees , we have performed an analysis of the kinematic structure of the cygnus ob1 association .",
    "specifically , we have focused the study on the search for groupings in the phase subspace formed by angular coordinates and radial velocity .",
    "we have applied two independent methodologies ( skg and optics ) to find structures in this subspace .",
    "the results obtained by both are compatible with each other , although the substructures determined through optics are spatially more compact .",
    "we have found two main kinematic groupings , which have different radial velocity and different centroids , located at a significant distance from one another in the line of sight , but always within the association s assumed range of distances .",
    "we label these groupings as group 1 and group 2 according to skg , which correspond to the ne and sw substructures according to optics , respectively .",
    "the cygnus ob1 association can be divided into two cavities , one with the walls visibles in infrared ( ne part ) and the other in the optical ( sw part ) .",
    "3 .   lozinskaya and collaborators found similar structures in their previous studies .",
    "they determined two large shells defined by ionised gas emission and another common structure that encompasses them .",
    "the elongated common shell around the cygnus ob1 association is demarcated by bright infrared nebulae in the north - east and optical nebulae in the south - west part of the area .",
    "the third grouping ( group 3 ) found with the skg methodology , not detected through optics , could be stars that form part of the common shell that surrounds the association and could represent the stellar population of the first starburst within the association .",
    "5 .   with regard to the distance ,",
    "whether considering the photometric distance of the possible cluster centres of the two groupings , or calculating from the velocity gradient of the two detected substructures , we are led to believe that they are well separated along the line of sight .",
    "taking into account the distance determined for the two groupings , we might consider that the cavities of the cygnus ob1 association are separated not less than a half kiloparsec along the line of sight .",
    "this distance is much larger than the size of the association over the sky , therefore the main axis of the association is along the line of sight . how to connect this structure with the galactic spiral structure , or even with other associations that form cygnus - x region ?",
    "this region has always been controversial and the majority of studies of the spiral structure of the galaxy @xcite consider that this galactic direction runs parallel to a spiral _ armlet _ where our sun is situated .",
    "the results found here do not contradict this hypothesis , but they do show a highly complicated field of velocities that requires more complete and precise data samples .",
    "the compiled data in this paper are not homogeneous , because they come from different catalogues and they were obtained using diverse instrumentation and in different epochs .",
    "we are also limited in magnitude , in that these previous studies are not particularly deep - in other words , they are unable to cover weak stars . in the near future , with the data that gaia @xcite and weave @xcite will provide , we will be able to see whether these same structures remain or even if it is possible to find other substructures on lower spatial scales .",

    "this research has made use of the simbad data base , the vizier catalogue access tool and the aladin sky atlas , developed at cds , strasbourg , france . also , this research has made use of the webda data base , operated at the institute for astronomy of the university of vienna .",
