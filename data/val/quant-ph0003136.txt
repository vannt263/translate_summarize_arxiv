    "ideally , a quantum computation is a sequence of local unitary transformations applied to a register of qubits which are initially in the state @xmath4 ; followed by a measurement . initializing the state of the quantum register",
    "is the biggest challenge in nmr quantum computing ( which is perhaps the most advanced technology in terms of the scale of experiments performed to date @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty is that the register is actually initially in ( approximately ) the binomial distribution over pure states @xmath5 , in which each qubit is independently in the state @xmath6 with probability @xmath7 ; the currently achievable polarization @xmath8 is quite small .",
    "there are currently two ways of implementing quantum computation in this technology .",
    "the first is used in current experiments @xcite , but does not scale beyond several qubits  the output signal decreases exponentially in the number of qubits in the quantum register .-",
    "qubit quantum computer with one clean qubit is unavoidable , due to the result @xcite . ]",
    "the second does scale , but is not feasible at the currently achievable values of polarization in liquid nmr @xcite .",
    "an intriguing third possibility was raised in @xcite .",
    "suppose we start with one qubit in the pure state @xmath6 in tensor product with @xmath9 qubits in a maximally mixed state ( i.e.in a uniform distribution over basis states @xmath5 ) .",
    "is it possible to simulate general quantum computation by effecting a sequence of elementary quantum operations on this register ? if the answer were affirmative , this would yield a procedure that would both scale and be currently feasible using the scalable initialization procedure to convert the initial binomial state to a state where the last @xmath9 qubits are maximally mixed and the first bit has high polarization ( the strength of the output signal is now proportional to this polarization ) .",
    "this is the question we focus on in this paper .",
    "it is easy to see that if all @xmath10 qubits are in the maximally mixed state then no computation is possible .",
    "this is because applying any unitary transformation to this mixture leaves it invariant .",
    "this simple argument stands in striking contrast to the difficulty of the seemingly very similar case , in which just a single qubit is in a pure state , while all the others are maximally mixed . since the initial state of the register is completely specified , the only real input in this model is the sequence of elementary quantum operations .",
    "so , given a quantum circuit @xmath11 which we would like to simulate on an input @xmath12 , we wish to know whether there is a sequence of elementary quantum operations on the @xmath10 qubit register , which first prepares a quantum ( mixed ) state which encodes @xmath12 , and then simulates @xmath11 on it . of course",
    ", we will require that these mixed state encodings of basis states @xmath12 be distinguishable by some measurement with non - trivial probability .",
    "our main result shows that the above is impossible unless @xmath13 , showing that the simulation is no more efficient than an exhaustive classical calculation .",
    "the technique used to show this uses some information about the representations of the symmetric group .",
    "the appendix [ repthy ] provides some necessary notions from representation theory .",
    "we also show that using a 3-bit register it is possible to compute every language in nc1 .",
    "this should give some indication of why the impossibility result is so much harder than for the case when all @xmath10 qubits are maximally mixed .",
    "we begin by showing that in this model , even using a 3-bit register , we can compute every language in nc1 .",
    "recall that the initial state of the register is a uniform distribution over the four @xmath14-bit strings starting with a @xmath15 . in our simulation of nc1 , all our operations will simply permute basis states .    a @xmath14-bit quantum computer",
    "initialized with one clean qubit can recognize every language in nc1 .",
    "our simulation is based on barrington s result that nc1 can be simulated by a width @xmath16 permutation branching program @xcite .",
    "the main idea is quite simple : let the @xmath16 states of the permutation branching program be represented by the states @xmath17 through @xmath18 of the @xmath14-qubit register .",
    "without loss of generality assume that the permutation branching program accepts if the permutation it effects is the identity , and rejects if the permutation it effects is the transposition @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to simulate the permutation branching program by a sequence of elementary quantum operations . now",
    "if we measure the first qubit in the register , then in the case that the permutation branching program accepts  i.e.  the permutation effected is the identity  then measuring the first qubit in the register yields a @xmath15 with probability @xmath20 . on the other hand , if the permutation branching program rejects , then measuring the first qubit in the register yields a @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 .",
    "it is illuminating to try to extend this simulation to qnc1 .",
    "first notice that in barrington s procedure for simulating nc1 , each wire in the nc1 circuit is simulated at some stage in the branching program . in the case of a qnc1 circuit ,",
    "the state of a wire is given by a qubit , which is , in general , entangled with the qubits carried by the other wires in the circuit .",
    "therefore the state of this wire can not be expressed in isolation , and there appears to be no alternative to creating that entangled state as part of any simulation .",
    "thus the entire approach breaks down .",
    "one way to carry out such a construction , might be to apply a superposition of operations at each step : this extends the state space of the quantum computer and effectively provides many more clean qubits , making the model meaningless .",
    "moreover all proposed implementations of quantum computation involve a classical , time - varying sequence of operations , applied to a quantum register .",
    "since the control is classical , in any oblivious simulation the entangled quantum state of the simulated circuit must be encoded within the quantum register .",
    "we are given a quantum computer with an @xmath10 qubit register , with one bit initialized to @xmath6 and the rest of the @xmath9 qubits in a maximally mixed state .",
    "we would like to simulate an @xmath2 qubit quantum circuit @xmath11 on input string @xmath12 using this model .",
    "if we wish to do an oblivious simulation , as sketched in the previous section , we must encode an arbitrary @xmath2 qubit state into the uninitialized @xmath10 qubit register .",
    "to do so , it is sufficient to consider the @xmath22 basis states of the @xmath2 wires , and encode them as distinguishable states of the uninitialized @xmath10 qubit register ( for this to be an efficient encoding , we should have @xmath23 ) .",
    "the states must be distinguishable in the following sense : since we can prepare several copies of any state by repeating the simulation , we only require that there be a sequence of measurements on @xmath24 many copies of the state , that ( with high probability ) uniquely identify the state .",
    "indeed , it is possible to do this with @xmath25 , as follows : take the subspaces , spanned by the basis vectors in the sets @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "however , to perform an oblivious simulation , the encoding must satisfy another property ",
    "the quantum circuit @xmath11 might carry out any unitary operation on its quantum state , and in particular an arbitrary permutation on its classical states .",
    "again it is not hard to demonstrate an efficient encoding that satisfies this permutability condition , without distinguishability : take the subspaces spanned by the basis vectors in the sets @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is not possible to construct an efficient encoding that satisfies both conditions simultaneously .",
    "this is the content of the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath30 be the total number of basis states of the ideal quantum computer which is being simulated .",
    "note that each @xmath31 encoding one of these , is a subspace of dimension @xmath32 within the hilbert space @xmath33 of the computer .",
    "if the computer has @xmath0 clean qubits , then @xmath34 is of dimension @xmath35 .    [",
    "main - theorem ] suppose that computations on @xmath2 qubits can be obliviously simulated in an @xmath10-qubit , @xmath0-clean - qubit computer in our model , and that @xmath36 for every pair of input encodings @xmath37",
    ". then @xmath38 .",
    "this incidentally implies that the computation of an @xmath10-qubit , @xmath0-clean - qubit computer can be simulated by a classical computer with a @xmath39 computational overhead .",
    "it may be illuminating to consider a simpler , classical analogue of our problem . a classical circuit ( taking inputs in @xmath40 ) composed of reversible gates executes a permutation of @xmath40 .",
    "the analogous problem ( just considering the case @xmath41 ) is that we can only represent inputs as uniform probability distributions over a set of half the elements of @xmath40 .",
    "( in the quantum case this corresponds to axis - parallel subspaces of dimension @xmath32 . )",
    "the question is , what is the largest number of such subsets ( probability distributions ) which such a circuit can permute at will .",
    "it is also essential that the probability distributions be readily distinguishable by sampling , in other words the subsets must have small intersection .",
    "it is possible ( though we omit it in this extended abstract ) to provide a strictly combinatorial argument expressing the fact that this task is impossible for more than @xmath42 subsets , because of the tension between the two requirements ( permutability and distinguishability ) .",
    "the large size of the subsets means that we have far more constraints than we have degrees of freedom .",
    "the combinatorial argument shows that if the requirement of full permutability is imposed , and we have a superpolynomial ( in @xmath10 ) number of subsets , then the symmetric difference of every two sets must be a vanishing fraction of the size of the sets .",
    "the two types of sets @xmath43 described above , however , separately achieve distinguishability and permutability .    in the quantum case we have arbitrary subspaces in place of `` subsets '' ( or correspondingly axis - parallel subspaces ) . and",
    "the circuit of course can perform not just permutations of the basis , but general unitary operations . in sharp contrast with the classical case , two subspaces of half the dimensionality of the space typically will not intersect .",
    "nevertheless , the large dimension of the subspaces imposes strict constraints on an operator which must permute them ; the difficulty is in formulating the incompatibility of these requirements when the number of subspaces is large and the subspaces are required to be very distinct .    by assumption , there are unitary operators ( each corresponding to some sequence of steps in the computer ) permuting @xmath44 in all ways .",
    "let @xmath45 be the unitary operator corresponding to a permutation @xmath46 .",
    "if we have @xmath47 for all @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then the operators @xmath45 form a representation of @xmath50 and we can apply the representation theory of the symmetric group .",
    "actually , the situation is slightly more complicated .",
    "let @xmath51 be the unitary group on @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the subgroup of @xmath51 acting on @xmath44 , i.e.  carrying any @xmath31 to some @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the subgroup of @xmath52 that fixes all of @xmath44 ; thus @xmath54 is normal in @xmath52 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath55 , but although this means that @xmath52 can permute the subspaces @xmath44 in arbitrary ways , it is different from saying that there is a subgroup of @xmath52 isomorphic to @xmath50 ( or in other words that we can pick elements of @xmath52 so as to have these operators compose properly ) .",
    "first , we show how to prove theorem [ main - theorem ] if we can select transformations @xmath45 so that they form a representation ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the more general case will be handled in the next section .",
    "appendix ( section [ repthy ] ) explains the notions of representation theory used in this and the next section .",
    "we show that every pair @xmath57 have a substantial intersection .",
    "consider the decomposition of @xmath33 into irreducible representations @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 .    either the first row or the first column of the young diagram of each @xmath60 is of length more than @xmath61 .",

    "we use the following fact from the representation theory of the symmetric group : when we restrict an irreducible representation0 @xmath92 of @xmath50 of shape @xmath93 to a subgroup @xmath94 , it decomposes into irreducibles of @xmath86 in the following way : @xmath95 where @xmath96 ranges over all shapes of size @xmath97 that can be obtained by deleting an `` inside corner '' from @xmath93 .",
    "( an inside corner is simply a point of the shape whose deletion leaves a legal shape . )",
