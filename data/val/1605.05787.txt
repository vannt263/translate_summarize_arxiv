    "the plasma dynamics is governed by infinite - range interactions , i.e. coulomb potentials , and thus behaves differently than ordinary molecular gases . at the kinetic level , among various plasma models , the _ vlasov - poisson _ ( vp ) equations and _ fokker - planck - landau _ ( fpl ) equations are the most representative ones describing , respectively , collisionless and collisional plasma systems .    the vp system is a nonlinear kinetic system modeling the transport of charged particles in a collisionless plasma , under the effect of a self - consistent electrostatic field and possibly an externally supplied field .",
    "the electrostatic potential is coupled through poisson equation . some natural plasma , as for example solar wind , behaves as collisionless , since the mean free path of a particle traveling from the sun to the earth is of the order of sun - earth distance . because of its comparative simplicity , numerical schemes for vp equations have been not only thoroughly explored but also well developed .",
    "one can refer to , for example @xcite .",
    "the collisionless vp system exhibits a variety of dynamical phenomena .",
    "for example , the well - known filamentation ( filaments in phase space and steep gradients in @xmath0 ) due to its dispersive nature and landau damping mechanism for near equilibrium states satisfying some conditions .",
    "readers can refer to @xcite for more physical insights .",
    "if collisions are taken into account , particles are scattered and things could be different . to our best knowledge , there is rare work on such models .",
    "thus , we expect to study the numerical behaviors of the inhomogeneous fpl system for multiple species .",
    "the transport of probability density for the particle species @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 subject to some initial and boundary conditions on @xmath3 .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the distribution for species @xmath1 , the term @xmath4 is a nonlinear , nonlocal operator in divergence form and models the @xmath5 pair collisions ( e.g. electron - electron , ion - ion , electron - ion , etc . ) and @xmath6 are the coupling parameters . in our present work ,",
    "we take @xmath7 to be collision frequency with @xmath8 the knudsen number .",
    "the case @xmath9 corresponds to the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "the force field @xmath10 only depends on time and space position and can be external or self - consistent .",
    "if it is self - consistent , it corresponds to the electrostatic force @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the charge and @xmath13 is the self - consistent electrostatic field obtained from the poisson equation for charges @xmath14 subject to some boundary condition on @xmath15 .",
    "the fpl transport equation is used to model long - range coulomb interactions between charged particles ( e.g binary collisions occurring in a plasma ) .",
    "it is of primary importance in modeling evolution of collisional plasma and actually a rather realistic model especially when the magnetic field is very weak .",
    "the fpl transport equation can be derived from the general boltzmann transport equation by taking the so - called binary grazing collision limit , i.e collisions that only result in very small deflections of particle trajectories , as is the case for coulomb potentials with rutherford scattering @xcite .",
    "the original derivation is due to landau @xcite .",
    "it is also often called fokker - planck - landau equation in plasma physics due to the independent derivation in the fokker - planck form in @xcite .    with the general non - isotropic landau collision operator @xmath16",
    ", the inhomogeneous fpl model gains huge difficulties to handle , both analytically and numerically .",
    "the main factors generating such difficulties are the nonlinearity , non - locality and diffusive nature with high dimensionality .",
    "unlike other kinetic models , for example boltzmann equations , where some non - deterministic methods ( dsmc ) have been successfully applied , the infinite - range potential interactions greatly limit the applications of these type of monte carlo methods .",
    "many have tried to develop efficient deterministic solvers for the inhomogeneous fpl equations . however , due to the computational complexity mentioned above , they have turned to some simplified versions of this problem . among them , the space homogeneous fpl equations in the isotropic case were study in @xcite , 1d fokker - planck type operator @xcite , the cylindrically symmetric problem in @xcite , as well as very recent work in @xcite for a conservative scheme for a multispecies system of fpl equations .",
    "l. pareschi et al .",
    "proposed a spectral method to solve fpl equations @xcite , by taking truncated fourier series and extending solutions by periodicity .",
    "this method was not intended to preserve the natural collision invariants , so , as a consequence they introduced unphysical binary collisions .",
    "it can not avoid _ aliasing effects _ , which will be present whenever a vanishing function is approximated by a periodic one .",
    "later , filbet and pareschi @xcite applied the spectral method to study inhomogeneous fpl with 1d in space and 2d in velocity .",
    "the pure transport equations was further splitted and a finite volume scheme was used .",
    "then , crouseilles and filbet @xcite proposed a solver for inhomogeneous fpl with 1d in space and 3d in velocity , where the pure transport part was treated with a finite volume scheme and the landau operator was approximated by averaging of uncentered finite difference operators .",
    "however , the solver in @xcite only preserved mass and energy at the discrete level ( for the uncentered finite difference approximate landau operator ) , under some symmetry assumptions on the initial datum .    in this work ,",
    "we follow a regular time - splitting scheme , splitting the original inhomogeneous fpl equation into a pure transport problem , i.e vlasov - poisson equation for advection and a homogeneous fpl equation for collisions .",
    "these two subproblems can be treated with completely different schemes . for the vp problem",
    ", we apply the rkdg method with a piecewise polynomial basis subspace covering all collision invariants , which can be proved to conserve mass , momentum and kinetic energy up to some boundary effects that disappear if the domain is taken large enough .",
    "while for the homogeneous fpl equation , different than the one in @xcite , we extend the spectral method first introduced in @xcite for the nonlinear boltzmann transport equation and propose a conservative spectral method for homogeneous fpl equation , by first extending the solution by zero , representing the collision integral through choosing fourier modes as the test functions in the weak form and enforcing conservation routines . since two completely different numerical scheme are applied separately , our challenge is not only to link two different meshes and at the same time , but also to keep the conserved quantities . we have designed a new conservation correction process such that , after projecting the conservative spectral solution onto the dg mesh , the conserved moments are transferred to the dg solution as well .",
    "this work is based on a section of thesis dissertation @xcite of the first author under the direction of the second author of this manuscript .",

    "in the following , when talking about single - species distributions , we will drop the subscript @xmath1 for simplicity .",
    "the strong form of this nonlinear partial integrodifferential equation is @xmath33 where the collision kernel is of the form @xmath34    the fpl operator , as a limit of the boltzmann collision operator , possesses a similar conservation laws and decay of entropy(@xmath35-theorem ) . that is @xmath36 if and only if @xmath37 corresponding to the conservation of mass ( charge ) , momentum and kinetic energy . as in the previous chapters , we call the @xmath38 test functions",

    ". we will consider different problems associated to different forms of the operator @xmath51 in the following sections .",

    "we divide and conquer starting from a time splitting method . for zero force field , i.e @xmath52 , the time - splitting is an efficient and reliable way for conquering inhomogeneous problems ; however , we will employ the time - splitting to non - zero force field as well and show that it also works .",

    "_    the above two steps can be performed with different methods .",
    "the collisionless step can be done with finite difference , finite volume or ( dg)fem ; while the collisional step requires special techniques to handle the collisional operator .",
    "they will be introduced in the following sections .",
    "as mentioned in the time splitting scheme above , the collisionless and collisional subproblems can be treated separately with different methods . in the current section , we restrict ourselves to homogeneous fpl for the most interesting coulombian case @xmath30 , in 3d velocity space .",
    "different than the one proposed in @xcite , by taking truncated fourier series and extending solutions by periodicity , we do nt have to introduce nonphysical binary collisions and simply extending the solution by zero , by means of the extension operator in sobolev spaces as done in chapter 3 for the approximation of the nonlinear boltzmann collision operator .",
    "conservation of moments are guaranteed by calling a conservation routine .",
    "we assume that the distribution function @xmath63 , the solution of the fpl equation , usually is not compactly supported in @xmath0 but of negligible mass outside of a finite ball @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 actually depends on @xmath45 in the inhomogeneous case .",
    "however , numerically , in order to find an approximation in a finite domain , we assume @xmath63 is compactly supported in the above ball .    consider the cube @xmath67 which contains @xmath68 .",

    "it is recently shown in @xcite that the weight corresponding to the boltzmann collision operator converges to the one for landau operator , if collisions are grazing and the solutions of the bte have some regularity and decay for large velocity .",

    "in addition , from figure ( [ fig : inhomolp_2stream_kineticene ] ) and figure ( [ fig : inhomolp_2stream_elecene ] ) one can observe that , since the landau operator is essentially a diffusive operator , the oscillations generated by coupling with the poisson equations damps with collisions , and thus the state reaches stationary in a much earlier stage .",
    "we studied the inhomogeneous fpl equations , coupled with poisson equations which governing the self - consistent electric field .",
    "the complicated inhomogeneous problem is split into two subproblems , by time - splitting scheme .",
    "we applied two different methods for treating the pure transport vlasov problem and the pure collisional homogeneous fpl equation .",
    "the former is solved by rkdg method , which has achieved its success in many other kinetic problems ; while the latter is treated using conservative spectral method .",
    "the conservative spectral method was well developed for solving boltzmann equations and we extended the method to the fpl problems and apply to study the multi - component plasma .",
    "the temperature relaxation of the multi - component plasma is studied both analytically and numerically . to link the two different methods , or computing grids",
    ", we developed a new conservation routine which can guarantee no loss of moments when projecting the fourier solution onto dg meshes .",
    "all desired moments are preserved only with error of dg approximations .",
    "the whole scheme has been applied to study the well - known landau damping problems , whose results agree well with theoretical estimates , and to two stream flows .    the project is implemented with parallelization , hybrid mpi @xcite and openmp @xcite .    in the future",
    ", we would like to speed up the collision and conservation processes and meanwhile increase the gridding resolution , such that the current solver can tackle , in real world of collisional plasma , more challenging problems which is tough to be treated numerically .",
    "for example , we would like to apply non - periodic boundary conditons on the poisson equations and thus to study more nonlinear effects , for instance plasma sheath problems , which is of primary importance for aerospace engineering .",
