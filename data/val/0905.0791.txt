    "since the early 1970 s , observations have shown that the color of etgs reddens from the outskirts to the galaxy center ( faber 1972 ) .",
    "understanding the origin of such color gradient can strongly constrain the scenario of galaxy formation and evolution ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "most studies to date have been plagued by the large uncertainties due to small sample sizes and short wavelength baselines where color gradients are derived . despite these limitations",
    "they suggest that color gradients in etgs originate from metallicity variations ( peletier et al .",
    "1990 ; tamura et al .",
    "2000 ; tamura & ohta 2003 ) .",
    "small , positive age gradients are also consistent with observations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , though their presence has never been revealed in the family of etgs as a whole .",
    "positive age gradients are a robust prediction of the hierarchical paradigm of galaxy formation , as a consequence of the centrally peaked star formation of dissipative merging events .",
    "recent studies have shown a significant , intrinsic evolution of etg sizes , with high redshift galaxies being more compact ( by @xmath6 at @xmath7 ) than those of analogous stellar mass at @xmath8 .",
    "the origin of this variation in size is still a matter of debate and may be the result of different mechanisms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , specifically ( i ) the effect of minor dry mergers ; or ( ii ) a puffing - up mechanism due to agn feedback  @xcite ; or ( iii ) the increased amount of dissipation involved in gas - rich mergers forming etgs at high - redshift  @xcite .    in this letter , we use data from the sdss and ukidss surveys to address the origin of the mean color gradient in etgs in the nearby universe ( z@xmath90.1 ) , connecting it to the observed compactness of their high - redshift counterparts   cosmology with @xmath10 = 0.3 , @xmath11 = 0.7 , and @xmath12 = 75 km @xmath13 @xmath14 . ] . the combination of sample size , homogeneity of data , and large wavelength baseline , from optical to near - infrared ( g through k bands ) , results in an unprecedented accuracy in detecting both metallicity and age variations inside galaxies .",
    "in fact , while optical ( sdss ) data are very sensitive to the effects of both metallicity ( through line blanketing ) and age , the nir ( ukidss ) wavebands are dominated by the old , quiescent stellar populations , allowing the effects of age and metallicity to be effectively separated ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the sample of etgs was defined from sdss - dr6 with photometry and spectroscopy available .",
    "we selected all galaxies in the redshift range of 0.05 to 0.095 , with r - band petrosian magnitude  @xcite through rest - frame filters blue - shifted by a factor @xmath15 , adopting @xmath16 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . ]",
    "the choice of the lower redshift minimizes the aperture bias  @xcite , while the upper redshift limit makes the sample approximately volume - complete , since the value of m@xmath18 roughly corresponds to the apparent magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopy ( @xmath19 ) at @xmath20 .",
    "following  @xcite , etgs are those galaxies with sdss parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the presence of younger stars in the center of etgs is expected in most hierarchical formation scenarios . during the merger of gas - rich systems",

    "since the luminosity evolution of a stellar population is approximately independent of its metallicity , the internal metallicity gradient of etgs is assumed not to modify the effective radius with redshift .",
    "however , a difference in the formation epoch of two stellar populations corresponds to larger and larger differences in luminosity as we approach the formation epochs .",
    "our result implies that a younger stellar population in the galaxy center would brighten more rapidly with redshift than the outer stellar population , making the profile more concentrated at high @xmath5 , and possibly inverting the observed colour gradients . to quantify these effects ,",

    "[ size_ev ] compares the evolution in size , @xmath112 , from different sources in the literature with that expected from the three previously mentioned models .",

    "model c has the same metallicity and age gradients as model a for bc03 ssps , but a younger inner stellar population with @xmath119 .",

    "the value of @xmath120 is about @xmath98  @xcite . following the method of  @xcite",
    ", this gradient implies that effective radii of etgs increase by @xmath121 from @xmath114 to @xmath113 band at @xmath8 .",
    "the waveband dependence of @xmath112 would tend to reduce and possibly invert this trend , producing @xmath122 at high redshift .",

    "for both models a and c , @xmath123 is very close to @xmath108 , being @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively . interestingly ,",
    "positive color gradients in high - redshift etgs have been detected by  @xcite , who found that about one - third of field etgs at @xmath127 have blue cores , in contrast to only @xmath128 at lower redshift ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "[ size_ev ] shows that a single formation epoch for the inner stellar population of etgs does not reproduce the observations .",
    "model a predicts a size evolution of @xmath129 at @xmath130 , in good agreement with the data at @xmath131 .",
    "however , the evolution is too shallow for lower redshifts , where a smaller @xmath108 is required to fit the data ( model c ) . this result",
    "could be explained in a picture whereby etgs form at different redshifts by gas - rich mergers , and the redshift - size trend is due to the increase in the amount of dissipation in mergers with redshift  @xcite .",
    "[ size_ev ] suggests that the central bursts of star formation take place at different redshifts , above @xmath132 .",
