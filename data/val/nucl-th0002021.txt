    "in recent years , we have studied a number of nuclei around doubly magic @xmath5sn , @xmath6sn , and @xmath7pb @xcite within the framework of the shell model employing realistic effective interactions derived from the meson - theoretic bonn - a nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) potential @xcite .",
    "we have focused attention on nuclei with few valence particles or holes , since they provide the best testing ground for the basic ingredients of shell - model calculations , especially as regards the matrix elements of the two - body effective interaction .",
    "the main motivation for carrying out this extensive program of calculations was to try to assess the role of realistic effective interactions in the shell - model approach to the description of nuclear structure properties .",
    "the results of our calculations have so far turned out to be in remarkably good agreement with experiment for all the nuclei considered , providing evidence that realistic effective interactions are able to describe with quantitative accuracy the spectroscopic properties of complex nuclei . in this connection , it is worth noting that these results are considerably better than those obtained in earlier works for the light @xmath9-@xmath10",
    "nuclei @xcite .",
    "while in the @xmath6sn and @xmath7pb regions we have studied nuclei with both valence particles and holes , around @xmath11 we have only considered the light sn isotopes , namely we have not gone below the 50 - 82 shell .",
    "the study of nuclei lacking few nucleons with respect to @xmath5sn , which is the heaviest @xmath12 doubly magic nucleus , is of course of great relevance from the shell - model point of view .",
    "nuclei of this kind , however , lie well away from the valley of stability and experimental information on their spectroscopic properties is still very scanty . in this context ,",
    "the proton - rich @xmath0 isotones are of special interest .",
    "in fact , while the development of radioactive ion beams opens up the prospect of spectroscopic studies of a number of @xmath5sn neighbors , use of large multidetector @xmath13-ray arrays is already providing new experimental data for these singly magic nuclei . in particular , four excited states in @xmath1cd , two proton holes from @xmath5sn ,",
    "have been recently identified in an in - beam spectroscopy experiment @xcite .    on the above grounds",
    ", we found it very interesting to include in our program of calculations the proton - rich @xmath0 isotones @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd ( some preliminary results have already been presented in ref .",
    "actually , the motivation for the present study is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", these nuclei with two , three , and four holes in the @xmath14 shell offer the opportunity to test our realistic effective interaction for nuclei below @xmath5sn . on the other hand ,",
    "the success achieved by our previous calculations on medium- and heavy - mass nuclei encourages us to make predictions which may stimulate , and be helpful to , future experiments .",
    "the @xmath0 isotones have long been the subject of theoretical interest . in most of the shell - model calculations performed in the last two decades @xcite ( earlier",
    "references can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , attention has been focused on the lighter isotones up to mass 95 @xcite or 96@xcite . in this context",
    ", we may mention the extensive study of the @xmath0 isotones from @xmath15ge up to @xmath3pd performed some ten years ago by ji and wildenthal @xcite . in that work",
    "@xmath16ni was considered as a closed core and an empirical effective hamiltonian was obtained by fitting the two - body matrix elements and the single - particle energies to approximately 170 experimental data .",
    "actually , the low - energy spectra of @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag have been predicted only in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the protons were assumed to fill solely the @xmath17 and @xmath18 levels .    in all",
    "previous calculations empirical two - body matrix elements have been used , an exception being the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effective interaction was derived from the sussex interaction @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the present calculations are the first ones where the two - body effective interaction has been derived from a modern free nucleon - nucleon potential .    before closing this section",
    "we should remark that , at variance with our previous calculations in the @xmath6sn and @xmath7pb regions , we had to face here the problem of choosing a set of single proton - hole energies without much guidance from experiment .",
    "in fact , while no spectroscopic data are yet available for the single - hole valence nucleus @xmath19 in , only little relevant information is provided by the observed spectra of @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag .",
    "we will come back to this important point later .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an outline of our calculations and describe in detail how we have determined the single - hole energies .",
    "our results are presented and compared with the experimental data in sec .",
    "iii , where we also comment on the results of ref .",
    "section iv presents a summary of our conclusions .",
    "our effective interaction @xmath20 was derived from the bonn - a free nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) potential using a @xmath21-matrix formalism , including renormalizations from both core polarization and folded diagrams .",
    "since we have assumed @xmath5sn as a closed core , protons are treated as valence holes , which implies the derivation of a hole - hole effective interaction .",
    "we have chosen the pauli exclusion operator @xmath22 in the @xmath21-matrix equation ,    @xmath23    as specified @xcite by ( @xmath24 ) = ( 11 , 21 , 55 ) for both neutron and proton orbits . here",
    "@xmath25 represents the @xmath8 potential , @xmath26 denotes the two - nucleon kinetic energy , and @xmath27 is the so - called starting energy .",
    "we employ a matrix inversion method to calculate the above @xmath21 matrix in an essentially exact way @xcite . for the harmonic oscillator parameter @xmath28",
    "we adopt the value 8.5 mev , as given by the expression @xmath29 for @xmath11 . using the above @xmath21 matrix",
    "we then calculate the so - called @xmath30 box , which is composed of irreducible valence - linked diagrams up to second order in @xmath21 .",
    "these are just the seven one- and two - body diagrams considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since we are dealing with external hole lines , the calculation of the @xmath31-box diagrams is somewhat different from that usual for particles .",
    "for example , the familiar core - polarization diagram @xmath32 becomes    @xmath33{0.65in}{0.01 in } \\hspace{-0.68 in } \\raisebox { -0.13 in } { $ \\scriptstyle \\uparrow$ } \\hspace{-0.05in}c ~ \\rule [ 0.21in]{0.65in}{0.01in}\\hspace{-0.68 in } \\raisebox { 0.14 in } { $ \\scriptstyle \\downarrow$ } \\hspace{-0.05 in } h    \\hspace{-0.15 in } \\raisebox{-0.25in}{$\\scriptstyle j'$ } \\hspace{-0.05in}|~   \\raisebox{-0.12in}{$\\scriptstyle \\mid$ } \\hspace{-0.05 in } a \\hspace{0.01 in }   \\raisebox{0.14in}{$\\scriptstyle \\mid$ } \\hspace{-0.04in}p \\rangle \\langle~ \\rule[0.21in]{0.67in}{0.01in}\\hspace{-0.70 in } \\raisebox { 0.14 in } { $ \\scriptstyle \\downarrow$ } \\hspace{-0.05in}p ~ \\rule[-0.15in]{0.67in}{0.01in}\\hspace{-0.70 in } \\raisebox{-0.13 in } { $ \\scriptstyle \\uparrow$ } \\hspace{-0.05 in } d    \\hspace{-0.15 in } \\raisebox{-0.25 in } { $ \\scriptstyle j'$ } \\hspace{-0.05in}|~ \\raisebox{0.14in}{$\\scriptstyle \\mid$ } \\hspace{-0.06in}h~ \\hspace{0.00 in }",

    "( 2 ) , are related to the usual direct - coupled ones by a simple transformation , as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the effective interaction , which is energy independent , can be schematically written in operator form as :    @xmath40    where the integral sign represents a generalized folding operation @xcite .",
    "@xmath41 is obtained from @xmath31 by removing terms of first order in the reaction matrix @xmath21 .",
    "after the @xmath31 box is calculated , @xmath20 is then obtained by summing up the folded - diagram series of eq .",
    "( 3 ) to all orders using the lee - suzuki iteration method @xcite .",
    "as regards the electromagnetic observables , these have been calculated by making use of effective operators @xcite which take into account core - polarization effects . more precisely , by using a diagrammatic description as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have only included first - order diagrams in @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that folded - diagram renormalizations are not needed @xcite .",
    "let us now come to the single - hole ( sh ) energies .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , no spectroscopic information on @xmath19 in is available . to obtain information on the location of the sh levels we have therefore resorted to an analysis of the spectra of the lighter @xmath0 isotones . of course , most relevant to this analysis are those states which are predominantly of one - hole nature .",
    "actually , @xmath42nb is the first isotone where a state of this kind has been unambiguously identified for each of the four sh levels .",
    "more precisely , no states with a firm @xmath43 or @xmath44 assignment are reported for the heavier isotones , while at least one @xmath45 and one @xmath46 state have been identified up to @xmath47rh . in @xmath2ag",
    "there is only one @xmath46 state , which is the ground state .",
    "> from the above it is clear that , if one wants to determine the sh energies by reproducing the observed one - hole states , calculations up to nine valence holes have to be carried out .",
    "it is to be expected , however , that a set of sh energies determined in this way may not be the most appropriate for calculations where few valence holes are considered .",
    "in fact , as is well known , significant changes in the nuclear mean field may occur when moving away from closed shells .",
    "in addition , an effective two - hole interaction derived by considering @xmath5sn as a closed core may not be quite adequate for systems with several valence holes as , in these cases , many - body correlations are likely to come into play .    in this situation ,",
    "we have tried to determine the sh energies @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 relative to the @xmath51 level , which has long been recognized to be the lowest - lying one , from an analysis of the spectra of the @xmath5sn neighbors @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd , with two to four proton holes in the @xmath52 shell .",
    "we have found that ( i ) the energies of all the excited levels in @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag , which have an experimental counterpart , are quite insensitive to the position of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 orbits ; ( ii ) the ground - state energies of all three nuclei , as well as the seniority - two states @xmath55 and @xmath56 in @xmath3pd , depend practically only on the sum of the energies of these two levels , @xmath57 .",
    "it turns out that all the considered experimental spectra are well described overall by fixing @xmath37 at 5.2 mev .",
    "more precisely , only the @xmath58 states in the two even isotones and the @xmath59 and the @xmath60 states in @xmath2ag and @xmath3pd show a rather large discrepancy .",
    "to eliminate this discrepancy a much larger value of @xmath37 should be used , namely about 10 mev .",
    "this value , however , would produce a significant downshift of all other levels .",
    "in addition , as we shall see in the following , it would be at variance with an empirical analysis of the one - hole states in @xmath0 isotones .",
    "it may also be mentioned that the energies of the @xmath58 states , as well as those of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states , are all strongly dependent on the two - body matrix element @xmath61 . in this context",
    ", we should recall that also for the light sn isotopes our calculations with the bonn - a potential produced @xmath58 excitation energies somewhat higher than the observed values @xcite .    as for the @xmath62 level ,",
    "two states are sensitive to its position .",
    "they are the @xmath63 and @xmath64 states in @xmath2ag and @xmath3pd , respectively .",
    "we find that their experimental energies are very well reproduced by our calculations for @xmath65 mev .",
    "we have verified that this choice is rather independent of the value of @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , increasing @xmath37 by about 2 mev brings @xmath48 up to only 0.9 mev .",
    "> from the above findings it appears that the sh energies @xmath49 and @xmath50 can not be determined individually from the experimental data for @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd presently available . to obtain an estimate for these two @xmath37 s ,",
    "we have made a linear extrapolation of the energies of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 one - hole states observed in @xmath68y , @xmath42nb , and @xmath69tc .",
    "actually , states of this kind have been unambiguously identified only in @xmath68y and @xmath42nb .",
    "in particular , in the latter nucleus two @xmath43 states have been observed which exhaust almost all the @xmath53 strength . in our extrapolation , however , we have also included the experimental data relative to @xmath69tc , according to the indications of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the level at 2.1 mev is identified as an @xmath70 , @xmath71 state while plausible arguments are given favoring the @xmath43 assignment to the two states observed at 1.5 and 1.8 mev .",
    "the above procedure yields the values of about 2 and 3 mev for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 sh energies in @xmath19 in . owing to the uncertainty inherent in such a derivation",
    ", these values should be taken only as a reasonable estimate . in support of this procedure",
    ", however , speaks the fact that for the @xmath62 level it yields @xmath72 mev .    on the above grounds , we have adopted for the sh energies the following values ( in mev ) : @xmath73 , @xmath65 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "it should be pointed out that these values are quite different from those adopted by other authors . in particular , the sh energies determined in ref .",
    "@xcite are higher than ours , the difference ranging from more than 1 mev for @xmath48 and @xmath49 to 3.2 mev for @xmath50 .",
    "we present here the results of our calculations for @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd .",
    "they have been obtained by using the oxbash shell - model code @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xcite and theoretical spectra are compared in figs .",
    "1 , 2 , and 3 , where we report all the experimental levels , except the @xmath76 and @xmath77 states observed at 6.7 and 7.0 mev in @xmath3pd , which can not be constructed in our model space . in the calculated spectra",
    "only those yrast states which are candidates for the observed levels are reported . a complete list of excitation energies up to 5 , 3 , and 4 mev is given in tables i - iii for @xmath1cd @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd , respectively .",
    "> from figs",
    ". 1 - 3 we see that our results are in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "a measure of the quality of the agreement is given by the rms deviation @xmath78^{2}\\}^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath79 is the number of data .",
    "] , whose values are 107 , 108 , and 122 kev for @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd , respectively . as was already discussed in sec .",
    "ii , the main point of disagreement is the position of the @xmath58 state in both the even isotones , as well as that of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states in @xmath2ag and @xmath3pd .",
    "in fact , the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the energies of these four states goes from 140 to 263 kev while it is less than 100 kev for all other states .    as regards the structure of the states having an experimental counterpart , we find that the positive - parity states in all three nuclei are dominated by the @xmath80 configuration , while the negative parity ones are practically of pure @xmath81 character . in @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag only the ground states receive a significant contribution from configurations other than the dominant one , the percentage being about 20% in both nuclei . as for @xmath3pd ,",
    "the wave functions of the ground state and the first four excited states are even less pure .",
    "in fact , the percentage of the @xmath82 configuration reaches at most 81% for the @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 states , being only 64% for the ground state .",
    "note that in these states , as well as in the ground states of @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag , a significant percentage of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 is present .",
    "in particular , in the ground state of @xmath3pd the percentage of each of these two these configurations is 9% .",
    "> from figs . 1 - 3 we see that rather little experimental information is presently available for @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd",
    ". much richer spectra , however , are predicted by the theory .",
    "it is therefore interesting to discuss in some detail our predictions , in the hope that they may verified in a not too distant future .",
    "as regards @xmath1cd , it may be seen from table i that , just above the first four excited states having an experimental counterpart , we find three states with @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , the first two being the members of the doublet @xmath90 and the third one arising from the configuration @xmath91 .",
    "the position of the @xmath64 state is quite consistent with the experimental information available for the two lighter even isotones .",
    "in fact , in @xmath3pd and @xmath92ru a @xmath64 state has been observed at 2.65 and 2.62 mev , respectively . between 3.8 and 5 mev",
    "we find all the members of the @xmath93 multiplet and the @xmath94 state arising from the @xmath95 configuration . in this energy interval",
    "is also located the @xmath58 state of the @xmath96 configuration .    in table",
    "ii all the excitation energies up to 3 mev are reported for @xmath2ag .",
    "below this energy we find all the states arising from the configurations @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 as well as the two seniority - one states of the @xmath100 and @xmath101 configurations .",
    "in particular , we predict as first excited state a seniority - one @xmath102 state at about 0.5 mev .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with the experimental findings for the lighter isotones @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned that our first @xmath67 state is essentially a pure seniority - three @xmath98 state while almost all the @xmath70 one - hole strength is concentrated in the second one at 2.6 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "we find that the @xmath53 strength is almost equally distributed between the first and second @xmath66 states .    as for @xmath3pd , only 2 out of the 25 states which we predict up to 4 mev ( see table iii ) arise from configurations other than @xmath82 and @xmath103 .",
    "they are the @xmath104 and @xmath105 states with a @xmath106 and @xmath107 dominant component , respectively .",
    "> from the above discussion it is evident that some of our predictions are closely related to the values adopted for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for instance , as shown before , we find that the wave functions of several states in the three considered isotones contain non negligible components outside the ( @xmath51,@xmath62 ) space .",
    "this indicates that a two - level model space would not be adequate even for the description of the heavier @xmath0 isotones .",
    "we also predict the absence of a pronounced gap above the @xmath108 state in the spectrum of @xmath1cd as well as rather low - lying one - hole @xmath43 and @xmath44 states in @xmath2ag .",
    "this makes it clear that , in absence of a spectroscopic study of @xmath19 in , the discovery of new selected levels in @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag represents the best source of information on the sh spectrum .    to conclude this discussion ,",
    "a further comment is in order .",
    "as it occurs for the @xmath59 state in @xmath2ag and the @xmath58 and @xmath60 states in @xmath3pd , we expect that the calculated excitation energies of all other states in these two nuclei arising from the @xmath58 state of @xmath1cd may be somewhat overestimated ( 200 - 300 kev ) .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 states in @xmath2ag .",
    "let us now come to the electromagnetic observables .",
    "the effective operators needed for the calculation have been derived as described in sec .",
    "experimental information on electromagnetic properties in proton - rich @xmath0 isotones is very scanty .",
    "the measured @xmath113 transition rates @xcite are compared with the calculated values in table iv , where we also report our predicted @xmath114 values for all the states having an experimental counterpart .",
    "as regards the @xmath115 in @xmath1cd , the two different measured values result from the experiments of refs . @xcite and @xcite , where this nucleus was produced by a fusion - evaporation reaction and by fragmentation of a @xmath116cd beam , respectively . while there are some doubts about both these values @xcite , the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to a proton effective charge fairly larger than _ e _ , is consistent with that measured for @xmath3pd . from table",
    "iv we see that the agreement between experiment and theory for the @xmath115 and @xmath117 in @xmath3pd is quite satisfactory , the calculated values being only slightly smaller than the observed ones . as for @xmath1cd ,",
    "the calculated @xmath115 value agrees with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite within the error bars .",
    "it is worth noting that our results do not differ significantly from those obtained using an effective proton charge @xmath118 .    as regards the magnetic observables , only the magnetic moment of the @xmath119 state in @xmath3pd",
    "the measured value is @xmath120 nm @xcite , to be compared with the calculated one 10.54 nm .",
    "we have already mentioned in the introduction that several calculations have been performed to study the shell - model structure of the @xmath0 isotones .",
    "we only comment here on the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite where , assuming @xmath5sn as a closed core , the two - hole effective interaction was derived by using the sussex matrix elements in a perturbation scheme up to second order without folded - diagram renormalization . as pointed out in sec .",
    "ii , the adopted sh energies , as determined from a least - squares fit to the energies of the @xmath0 , @xmath121 nuclei , are much higher than ours . in that work , however , attention was focused on nuclei with @xmath122 and no results were given for @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag , for which experimental information has become available only in more recent times .",
    "we have therefore found it interesting to perform calculations for these two nuclei using the effective interaction and the sh energies of ref .",
    "we have also calculated a more complete spectrum of @xmath3pd than that given in @xcite .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to these calculations as sussex ( sux ) calculations .    the @xmath78 value relative to the sux calculations for @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd turns out to be 84 , 353 , and 218 kev , respectively .",
    "more explicitly , the experimental position of the positive - parity states is well reproduced .",
    "in particular , the calculated energies of the @xmath58 states in both even isotopes , as well as those of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states in @xmath2ag and @xmath3pd , come closer to the experimental values than those obtained from our calculations .",
    "for all other positive - parity states the agreement with experiment obtained from sux and our calculations is comparable . on the other hand , the @xmath123 and @xmath64 states in @xmath2ag and @xmath3pd",
    "lie 704 and 560 kev above the experimental ones , respectively , and the excitation energies of the first @xmath64 and @xmath102 states in @xmath1cd and @xmath2ag are predicted to be about 3.5 and 1.4 mev , which are not consistent with the experimental information available for the lighter isotones .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath2ag the @xmath53 and @xmath54 strengths are concentrated in the second @xmath43 and the second @xmath44 states , which are predicted to lie at about 3 and 4 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are more than 1 mev higher than ours which come quite close to those obtained by extrapolating the energies of these states from the lighter isotones . > from the above we feel that the values of the sh energies adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite are overestimated . as regards the @xmath62 level ,",
    "this conclusion is strongly supported by the fact that , as mentioned above , the calculated energies of the @xmath123 and @xmath64 states in @xmath2ag and @xmath3pd , which are substantially dependent on the position of this level , are largely overestimated .",
    "on the other hand , we have verified that decreasing the values of sh energies is not sufficient to improve the agreement between theory and experiment on the whole .",
    "in fact , while this produces a lowering of the negative - parity states it moves the positive - parity states up to too high an energy .",
    "this latter effect , however , might be compensated by taking into account folded - diagram renormalization , which produces in general a compression of the spectra . in this context",
    ", we may mention that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite say that the folded - diagram renormalization would have worked against the outcome of their calculations .",
    "our preceding remarks indicate that this conclusion could have been turned round had they made a different choice of the sh energies .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a shell - model study of the @xmath0 isotones @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd employing a two - hole effective interaction derived from the bonn - a nucleon - nucleon potential by means of a @xmath21-matrix folded - diagram approach .",
    "we have shown that all the experimental data available for these nuclei are well reproduced by our calculations .",
    "in addition , some of our predictions , namely the existence of a @xmath64 state in @xmath1cd and a @xmath124 state in @xmath2ag at 2.7 and 0.5 mev , respectively , are strongly supported by the experimental information existing for the lighter isotones .",
    "this work is framed in the context of an extensive program of calculations aimed at assessing just how accurate a description of nuclear structure properties can be provided by an effective interaction derived from the @xmath8 potential .",
    "the quality of the results presented here turns out to be comparable to that obtained in the @xmath6sn and @xmath7pb regions where , however , there is a substantially larger body of experimental data with which to compare the calculated spectroscopic properties . in particular , we emphasize that the experimental information existing for the @xmath0 isotones provides only little guidance to the choice of the sh energies , which renders it a difficult task .",
    "in this situation , our choice has been based on an analysis of the spectra of @xmath1cd , @xmath2ag , and @xmath3pd and on the values of the experimental @xmath43 and @xmath44 single - hole energies in @xmath68y , @xmath42nb , and @xmath69tc .",
    "we feel , however , that the unavoidable uncertainty in the adopted sh energies should not be so severe as to make our findings questionable .",
