    "globular clusters ( gcs ) have historically been viewed as simple systems whose evolutionary history is well understood , but new observations keep revealing surprising results .",
    "gcs have short central relaxation times compared to their ages .",
    "anisotropies and rotation are therefore likely to be very small in the central regions , while a moderate amount is expected in the outskirts @xcite .    flattening ( with a median axial ratio @xmath1 0.9 ) is found in the outer regions of galactic gcs @xcite .",
    "clusters closer to the bulge tend to be more flattened than those in the halo . given this observed flattening , rotation is expected in the outer parts of gcs , and indeed it has been measured for a number of them .",
    "table7.2 in @xcite includes all the relevant references before 1997 .",
    "more recent work by @xcite and @xcite and references in tables 1 & 2 of @xcite use individual radial velocity measurements to show that anisotropy increases towards the outskirts of clusters .",
    "it is still under debate how much of the observed flattening seen for the outer parts of gcs is due to galactic tidal effects , disk cross shocking or to rotation .",
    "on the theory side , analytical @xcite , fokker - planck @xcite , and @xmath2-body models @xcite indicate that the presence of rotation affects the dynamical evolution of single mass star clusters , by accelerating core - collapse time scales .",
    "the caveat is that the effect seems to vanish for isolated two - mass @xmath2-body models @xcite .",
    "recent models indicate that rotation could be a key ingredient in the formation of multiple generations of stars in gcs @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath2-body models seems to indicate that the rotation signature for the central region gets erased after a few relaxation times ( fig.14 of @xcite ) , which implies that rotation is not expected around the core radius of relaxed gcs .",
    "detailed modelling including central kinematics has been performed for a few clusters . in particular , @xmath3  cen @xcite , 47  tuc @xcite and m15 @xcite have been observed to rotate using various datasets and analysis techniques .",
    "@xcite undertakes the most thorough dynamical modelling for these three clusters to date .",
    "they find that for all three clusters , which have very different dynamical states , the ellipticity and anisotropy decrease towards the center , to the point of being practically isotropic inside the core radius . besides these three cases , kinematic observations covering the regions around one or two core radii are scarce .",
    "we are collecting optical , high resolution integral field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy of milky way gcs in an ongoing survey . in this letter",
    "we present data for the first 11 clusters that we have observed .",
    "+      +      +",
    "our sample was constructed based only on feasibility : we first selected all objects that are observable from the mcdonald observatory ( at airmass @xmath4 2 ) from the catalog of milky way gcs by @xcite ( hereafter h96 ) and for which surface brightness estimates @xcite led to reasonable exposure times ( @xmath5h ) .",
    "this gave a sample of 27 clusters , 11 of which are presented here .",
    "the observations were carried out during august 2012 , and april and august 2013 using the fiber - based ifu spectrograph virus - w @xcite at the 2.7 m harlan j.  smith telescope of the mcdonald observatory in texas .",
    "we used the higher resolution mode of the instrument with @xmath6 and a wavelength coverage of 4855 5475 .",
    "the ifu has a field of view of 105@xmath7  55  with the long edge always aligned with the east - west axis .",
    "the fibers are 3.2  in diameter on sky and are arranged in a dense - pack configuration with a fill - factor of 1/3 such that three dithered observations fill in the gaps between fibers .    for each cluster we observed two offset but slightly overlapping pointings such that the combined field of view amounts to about 105@xmath7  105 . depending on surface brightness , we took 600s to 2400s exposures in each dither position ( see table[tab : results ] ) , split in half for cosmic ray rejection .",
    "we took 600s empty sky exposures between each dither position and recorded bias frames and hg and ne arc lamp exposures for calibration every night .",
    "our data reduction uses the fitstools package by @xcite and the cure pipeline developed by our group for hetdex @xcite .",
    "the procedure follows standard prescriptions for the generation of master biases , flats and arc lamp frames .",
    "after the spectral extraction , we average the two cosmic ray split exposures and the bracketing sky exposures , rejecting spurious events .",
    "we scale the sky spectra by exposure time and subtract them from the science exposures .",
    "we combine the individual fiber spectra of the two dithered pointings into one datacube by imposing a pixel grid with an edge length of 1.6 .",
    "a detailed description of the reduction is given in @xcite .",
    "given the 3.2  fibers , we typically integrate over the light of several stars per fiber .",
    "a simple cross correlation method may therefore yield uncertain velocities .",
    "we use a newly implemented version of the maximum penalized likelihood method by @xcite ( see @xcite ) to first recover non - parametric line of sight velocity distributions ( losvd ) .",
    "we then fit gaussian models to each losvd while only taking velocity channels that are separated by no more than 40kms@xmath8 from the systemic velocity into account .",
    "we extract the ten brightest spectra of each datacube to use as templates , since they are most likely dominated by the light of individual bright stars .",
    "we pick the spectrum that delivers the lowest rms of the residuals in the non - parametric fit as final template .",
    "we employ no spatial binning but reject spectra with a mean signal - to - noise below 5 .",
    "typical errors for the recovered mean velocities are 1.5kms@xmath8 .",
    "the derivation of velocities for each pixel produces a velocity field to which we fit a plane parametrized by @xmath9 where the slopes @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the systemic velocity @xmath12 are free parameters .",
    "the fit is carried out using a standard minimum least square fitting routine ( minpack lmdif ; @xcite ) . from this",
    ", we obtain a kinematic position angle @xmath13 and the absolute value of the central velocity gradient @xmath14 . during the fit , we reject outlier pixels ( in velocity ) through @xmath15 clipping with @xmath16 .",
    "the mean rms of the residuals of the plane fit is 3.3kms@xmath8 over all gcs .",
    "we estimate the statistical uncertainty through bootstrapping : we draw one hundred subsamples with replacement and perform the plane fit for each of the subsamples . individual pixels in the velocity fields",
    "are correlated over scales of up to five pixels because of fiber size and seeing .",
    "the bootstrapping method therefore does not reflect the systematic uncertainty caused by a few high - velocity stars . to assess this effect",
    ", we generate another 100 datasets where we mask a total of 11 randomly placed 7px  @xmath17  7px , subregions , covering about 10% of all pixels .",
    "we repeat the plane fit to all these 100 datasets and report the total spread of position angles and gradients as systematic uncertainty .",
    "in order to test if the observed rotation is reflected in the morphology , we derive ellipticities and position angles using catalogs from the hst acs survey of gcs @xcite that are available for 10 out of our 11 clusters .",
    "we obtain the ellipticities and position angles from an eigenvector analysis of the spatial star distribution . for this",
    "we compute the @xmath18 covariance matrix of the stellar positions as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the catalog coordinates and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the adopted center coordinates of the cluster .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath24 and the eigenvalues @xmath25 then yield the ellipticity and the position angle through @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we reject stars outside a radius of 100 which reaches the edge of the field of view of acs - wfc .",
    "the catalogs exclude non cluster - members .",
    "we compute the center positions iteratively by shifting the @xmath28aperture until the first moments in both spatial directions become zero with respect to the new center position .",
    "we compare these centers with the ones derived by @xcite for the common objects .",
    "the differences are under 2  on average .",
    "we tested that the aperture truncation does not affect our reported ellipticities . using radial bin counts",
    ", we have further tested that the derived ellipticities and position angles are not caused by artefacts in the catalogs such as lower star counts around bright stars .    in general , our central ellipticities",
    "are small compared to published values at larger radii by up to a factor of ten ( compared for instance with @xcite ) . also , we find no obvious correlation between our results and published ellipticities .",
    "this however is easily explained by the fact that our data probe vastly different radial scales .",
    "+        as further verification of our derived position angles , we generate synthetic images from the catalogs by assigning the same magnitude to the stars in the catalog and adding them to an empty image with a point - spread - function obtained from the acs image itself .",
    "we then apply a gaussian smoothing of 20 .",
    "we overplot contours and verify visually that the eigenvector based position angles are not affected by artefacts in the catalogs .",
    "we estimate the statistical uncertainty using the bootstrapping method in the same manner as we do for the kinematic datasets .",
    "the bin maps show that artefacts in the catalogs can affect our measurements of the ellipticity .",
    "we therefore run our analysis on hemispheres by mirroring all points of one hemisphere about the center onto the other side .",
    "we repeat this on 36 different hemispheres , separated by 10 degrees .",
    "we report the total spread of values for the position angle and the ellipticity as systematic error .",
    "the eigenvalue derived ellipticities show no significant values different from zero inside the virus - w field of view , and consequently , the derived position angles are poorly constrained .",
    "the strongest signal is typically found in the 75   100  radial range .",
    "m28 is not part of the hst acs survey , we therefore construct a catalog using daophot @xcite on an archival hst acs f625w image ( pi jonathan grindlay ; see @xcite for a description of the process ) .",
    "we fill the gaps between the acs chips and extend the coverage of the catalog in radial range using wfc3/uvis f390w ( pi francesco ferraro ) and wfpc2 f555w ( pi roberto buonanno ) images .",
    "the final catalog extends to a radius of 85  from the cluster center .",

    "we also list the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "as m28 has no catalog available from the acs survey , our measurements of the position angle and the flattening are based on a catalog that we compile from hst archival data as described in the text .",
    "fig.[fig : vmaps_ellmaps ] shows maps of the line - of - sight velocity for the 11 clusters in our sample .",
    "the rotation is clearly seen as a velocity gradient across the field .",
    "we detect statistically significant central rotation in all clusters .",
    "we translate the projected absolute values of the velocity gradients to physical units using distance estimates , core radii , and half light radii from h96 .",
    "we find that the velocity gradients have absolute values in the range of 0.2  1.3kms@xmath29 with average values of 0.7kms@xmath29 , 0.6kms@xmath30 , and 2.2kms@xmath31 .    in fig.[fig",
    ": vmaps_ellmaps ] we indicate the derived kinematic position angles and also overplot the eigenvector derived position angles .",
    "the low ellipticities of m10 , m12 and ngc6934 leave the values from our eigenvalue analysis poorly constrained . in the other cases ,",
    "both position angle measurements agree well within the errors with one notable exception : for m92 the kinematic position angle deviates from the catalog derived value by about 45@xmath32 .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of m92 the southern field covered a relatively sparse region of the cluster and thus , it poorly constrains the direction of the velocity gradient .",

    "correlations ] we compare the absolute values of the central velocity gradients with other parameters from the h96 catalog .",
    "we find a very tight correlation with the central velocity dispersion , with the exception of m80 .",
    "this correlation is possibly the result of dispersion measurements that include ( and do not correct for ) rotation .",
    "for example , m13 has the second largest published value of the central velocity dispersion in our sample @xcite . by extrapolating the central rotation gradient to the actual positions of the stars",
    "we can derive a velocity dispersion of 9.2kms@xmath8 .",
    "this extrapolation does not take the flattening of the rotation curve into account and therefore it is not surprising that this value is actually larger than the @xcite value of 7.1kms@xmath8 .",
    "it does show , however , that rotation can significantly impact the dispersion measurements . for m80",
    ", the rotation can probably not explain the large value of the central dispersion of 12.4kms@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the observed correlation between the outer ellipticity and the central rotation however is most likely physical .",
    "the only outliers ( m10 and m80 ) fall nicely on the correlation when the ellipticity values from h96 are replaced by those of @xcite .",
    "we also find a correlation between central luminosity density and the value of the velocity gradient .",
    "more speculative is a possible correlation of the amount of central rotation with the distance from the galactic center as shown in the lower right panel .",

    "the solid line indicates the locus of edge - on isotropic oblate rotators @xcite .",
    "all but two of our objects fall below this line . however , as discussed before , the estimates for the central dispersion are likely affected by rotation and also the extrapolation of the rotational velocity to @xmath35 may yield incorrect values for the actual maximum rotation . on the other hand our analysis",
    "does not take projection effects into accout which may move objects even further away from the line . while we have no reason to expect that gcs behave like isotropic oblate rotators , the clusters in our sample",
    "follow a general trend of larger ( v/@xmath34 ) for increased ellipticity which again indicates that rotation is the driving factor for the flattening .",
    "we present central velocity fields for 11 milky way gcs derived from data collected in an ongoing survey using the fiber based , optical ifu instrument virus - w .",
    "we find that all clusters presented here show significant gradients in the observed velocity fields that are indicative of rotation .",
    "this is surprising and clearly shows a need for theoretical models to produce and to sustain rotation on scales comparable to the core radius .",
    "we also find that the orientation of the central flattening in stellar density ( within an 100  aperture ) is generally in good agreement with the kinematic position angle that we derive from the velocity fields .",
    "we show that the central rotation correlates very well with published values for the central velocity dispersion , thus pointing to a possible impact from the rotation .",
    "a detailed analysis of this effect and a comparison with dispersion estimates from our data will be included in a subsequent publication .",
    "we also find a strong correlation with outer ellipticity indicating that , at least for the objects in our sample , the flattening is primarily due to rotation rather than the milky way tidal field .",
    "there is an indication of an increase of rotation towards the galactic center .",
    "if true , this might have a strong impact on formation theories and clearly shows the need for a larger sample .",
    "one caveat of our study so far is that our sample so far lacks any core collapsed clusters .",
    "it is conceivable that this process will eradicate rotation through the transport of angular momentum to the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "future observations will specifically target such systems .",
    "our survey of 27clusters will allow us to probe in detail how rotations correlate with properties such as central velocity dispersions , ellipticity , ages , spatial distribution , and total luminosity .",
