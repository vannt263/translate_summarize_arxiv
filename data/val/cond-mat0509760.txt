    "theoretically , extensive work is carried out in the area of complex non - collinear magnetism , particularly for surface and bulk systems . in fact a lot of interesting physics would be missed if only collinear magnetic structures were considered .",
    "in fact , magnetic nanostructures on magnetic or nonmagnetic substrates are attractive to the scientific community due to their novel and unusual properties@xcite being of relevance both for theory as well as for the applications in the magnetoelectronics devices",
    ".    one of these properties is the non - collinear magnetic order occurring for geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets , _",
    "e.g. _ on a triangular lattice , in disordered systems , exchange bias systems , and molecular magnets , or for systems which exhibit either competing exchange interactions , or between exchange and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "a simple model for frustration is the following : starting with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) cr dimer , the addition a third cr atom to form an equilateral triangle leads to a frustrated geometry .",
    "each atom would like to couple af to both other atoms .",
    "since this is impossible , the moments of the three atoms rotate until a compromise is found .",
    "the ground state is then non - collinear , characterized by an angle of 120@xmath0 between each two atoms . the same situation will also occur for the af cr dimer , since the interaction of both cr atoms with the ferromagnetic substrate atoms is either ferromagnetic of antiferromagnetic . as we will show in this paper ,",
    "also in this case a non - collinear structure can result .",
    "the majority of the _ ab - initio _ methods available for the treatment of non - collinear magnetism make explicit use of bloch s theorem and are thus restricted to periodic systems ( bulk or films ) . then , even for collinear magnetism , one needs huge supercells to simulate impurities in a given host ( bulk or film ) in order to avoid spurious interactions of the impurities from adjacent supercells .",
    "a few methods have been developed to treat free clusters , but to our knowledge no _ ab - initio _ methods exist for the investigation of non - collinear magnetism of clusters in bulk or deposited on surfaces .",
    "first non - collinear calculations by the kkr green function method , though not self  consistent , were already performed in 1985 .",
    "et al._@xcite could show by using the method of constraints that the exchange interaction between the moments of mn and fe impurity pairs in cu is in good approximation described by the @xmath1dependence of the heisenberg model .",
    "sandratskii _ et al._@xcite and kbler _",
    "et al._@xcite pioneered the investigation of non - collinear magnetic structures using self  consistent density functional theory .",
    "one of the first systems studied by sandratskii _",
    "et al._@xcite was the spin spiral of bcc fe with the kkr method .",
    "later on , @xmath2-fe was a hot topic , and the appearance of the experimental work of tsunoda _",
    "et al._@xcite led to the development of other first  principles methods able to deal with non - collinear magnetism such as lmto@xcite , asw@xcite and flapw.@xcite    several papers@xcite describe how symmetry simplifies the calculational effort for the spiral magnetic structures in the case of perfect periodic systems  this involves the generalized bloch theorem . in _ ab - initio _ methods , this principle is used together with the constrained density functional theory@xcite giving the opportunity of studying arbitrary magnetic configurations where the orientations of the local moments are constrained to nonequilibrium directions .    concerning free clusters ,",
    "few methods are developed .",
    "for example , oda _",
    "et al._@xcite developed a plane - wave pseudopotential scheme for non - collinear magnetic structures .",
    "they applied it to small fe clusters for which they found non - collinear magnetic structures for fe@xmath3 and linear - shape fe@xmath4 .",
    "this last result was in contradiction with the work of hobbs _",
    "et al._@xcite who found only a collinear ferromagnetic configuration using a projector augmented - wave method .",
    "small cr clusters were found magnetically non - collinear,@xcite as shown also by kohl and bertsch@xcite using a relativistic nonlocal pseudopotential method after optimization of the ionic structure by a monte carlo technique .",
    "however , within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of density - functional theory , hobbs _",
    "et al._@xcite find that in many cases the non - collinear states can be metastable , while the ground - state solutions are collinear and arise after geometrical optimization of the free - standing clusters .",
    "one main result of oda _",
    "et al._@xcite and hobbs _",
    "et al._@xcite concerns the variation of the magnetization density with the position .",
    "the spin direction changes in the interstitial region between the atoms where the charge and magnetization densities are small , while the magnetization is practically collinear within the atomic spheres .",
    "this supports the use of a single spin direction for each atomic sphere as an approximation in order to accelerate the computation ; this approximation is followed also here .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a method based on the full - potential kkr scheme@xcite which can deal with non - collinear magnetism in systems of reduced symmetry .",
    "this method is ideal for treating impurities or small clusters on surfaces or in bulk . as an application we study small 3d clusters on the ni(001 ) surface where we find complex magnetic configurations .",
    "the kkr method uses multiple - scattering theory in order to determine the one - electron green function in a mixed site and angular  momentum representation .",
    "the retarded green function is expanded as :    @xmath5    here , @xmath6 is the energy and @xmath7 , @xmath8 refer to the atomic nuclei positions . by @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "we denote respectively the shorter and longer of the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 which define the position in each wigner  seitz cell relative to the position @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the regular and irregular solutions of the schrdinger equation for the potential @xmath15 at site @xmath16 , being embedded in free space ; @xmath17 is a combined index for angular momentum quantum numbers ; @xmath18 is truncated at a maximum value of @xmath19 .",
    "the first term on the lhs of equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is the so - called _ single site scattering term _ , which describes the behavior of an atom @xmath16 in free space . all multiple- and back - scattering information is contained in the second _ back - scattering _ term via the structural green functions @xmath20 which are obtained by solving the algebraic dyson equation : @xmath21 equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) follows directly from the usual dyson eq .  of the form @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the perturbation in the potential and",
    "@xmath24 the reference system green function .",
    "the summation in ( [ eq:2 ] ) is over all lattice sites @xmath25 and angular momenta @xmath26 for which the perturbation @xmath27 between the @xmath28 matrices of the real and the reference system is significant ( the @xmath29-matrix gives the scattering amplitude of the atomic potential ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath30 are the structural green functions of the reference system . for the calculation of a crystal bulk or surface ,",
    "the reference system can be free space , or , within the tight - binding kkr formulation,@xcite a system of periodically arrayed repulsive potentials .",
    "after the host ( bulk or surface ) green function is found , it can be used in a second step as a reference for the calculation of the green function of an impurity or a cluster of impurities embedded in the host .",
    "the algebraic dyson equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is solved by matrix inversion , as we will see later on in equation  ( [ eq:15 ] ) . in case of spin - dependent electronic structure ,",
    "spin indexes enter in the @xmath29-matrix , the green functions and in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) . especially in the case of non - collinear magnetism ,",
    "these quantities become @xmath31 matrices in spin space , denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "once the spin - dependent green function is known , all physical properties can be derived from it . in particular , the charge density @xmath34 and spin density @xmath35 are given by an integration of the imaginary part of @xmath33 up to the fermi level @xmath36 and a trace over spin indexes @xmath37 ( putting the green function in a matrix form in spin space ) : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 are the pauli matrices and @xmath40 means the trace operation in spin space .    the basic difference between non - collinear and collinear magnetism is the absence of a natural spin quantization axis common to the whole crystal .",
    "the density matrix is not anymore diagonal in spin space as in the case of collinear magnetism . instead , in any fixed frame of reference it has the form @xmath41 \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] at any _ particular point _ in space , of course",
    ", a _ local _ frame of reference can be found in which @xmath42 is diagonal , but this local frame can change from point to point .    in order to deal with non - collinear magnetism",
    ", we have to solve the appropriate dyson equation .",
    "first we define the reference system which is a perfect surface characterized by collinear magnetism .",
    "although the collinearity of the reference system is not a necessary requirement , it serves our purpose of calculating the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic surfaces which are used as reference systems .",
    "thus the host green functions @xmath43 and @xmath29-matrices @xmath44 are assumed diagonal in spin space . in this way , in the case of a magnetic host , a global spin frame of reference is defined .",
    "the host @xmath43 and @xmath44 are thus of the form : @xmath45 then the perturbed system is constructed . the impurity atoms which might couple magnetically in a non - collinear way reside on the surface , perturbing the potential at a few neighboring sites ( atoms or empty cells representing the potential in the vacuum ) . within this finite cluster of perturbed sites",
    "the magnetization can be non - collinear leading to the appearance of non - diagonal elements of the @xmath29-matrix : @xmath46 the non - diagonal @xmath29-matrix contains the information on spin - flip scattering by the atomic potential .    at this stage",
    "an approximation enters our method .",
    "it is assumed that , separately for each atom , there exists an intra - atomic spin quantization axis common to the whole atomic cell .",
    "this axis is identified with the spatial average of the magnetization density @xmath47 in each cell @xmath16 .",
    "this defines the local spin frame of reference . in this way we neglect the variation of the spin quantization axis within the cell during self consistency , avoiding the time - consuming numerical solution of the potential of coupled schrdinger equations of the two spin channels . within the local density approximation of density - functional theory ,",
    "the exchange correlation potential has the same reference frame as the local magnetization @xmath47 .",
    "then for each atom we have a potential which is collinear in the local frame , and the solutions of the schrdinger equation , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , depending on the spin index @xmath37 of the local frame .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation separately for each spin channel provides also the diagonal @xmath29-matrix of each atomic cell @xmath16 in the local frame of reference : @xmath50 then the @xmath29-matrix is rotated from the local to the global spin frame of reference using the spin rotation matrix @xmath51 : @xmath52 @xmath51 being given by @xmath53 the polar angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 define the direction of the local magnetic moment with respect to the global spin frame of reference .",
    "normally , @xmath56 and @xmath57 vary within the atomic cell , but in the approximation used here , average angles are defined for each cell via an averaging of the magnetization density within the cell .",
    "of course , when self - consistency is achieved , both the averaged and the point - by - point varying magnetization direction can be extracted from the output density matrix .",
    "thus the assumption of a unique spin direction in each cell is only made for the spin - dependent potential .",
    "the @xmath29-matrix in the global spin frame of reference can be rewritten in the following way :    @xmath58 { \\boldsymbol}{u}_n^{\\dag } \\label{eq:10}\\ ] ]    with @xmath59 is the @xmath60 component of the pauli matrices : @xmath61    it is convenient to define the projection matrices @xmath62 for the local spin  up ( @xmath63 ) and spin  down ( @xmath64 ) directions as : @xmath65 then @xmath66 is written as : @xmath67 in the collinear case the local and global frames are identical and the projection operators reduce to : @xmath68 at this stage , the difference between the @xmath29-matrices @xmath69 is calculated in order to get all the ingredients to solve the dyson equation for the structural green function ( @xmath70 has been defined in the global frame in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) ) .",
    "this is the analogue of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) in matrix form in spin space : @xmath71 here , in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , @xmath72 are matrices of size @xmath31 in spin space , size @xmath73 in angular momentum space , and size @xmath74 ( with @xmath75 the number of sites ) in real space ; all these indices are combined to form @xmath76-dimensional matrices .",
    "the @xmath29-matrix itself is diagonal in real space site indexes .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:15a ] ) for the structural green function requires matrix inversion , yielding @xmath72 in the global frame : @xmath77    equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be now rewritten in the non - collinear case in order to obtain the green function in the global frame . using the matrices @xmath62 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) ) to project the local wavefunctions to the global frame , the green function is written as :    @xmath78    if needed , the green function can be rotated to the local frame of any atom by the use of the transformation matrices @xmath51 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) ) .",
    "we point out that , even in the local frame of reference , the green function is not in general diagonal in spin space .",
    "finally we calculate the charge density and spin density from equations  ( [ eq:2.5],[eq:2.6 ] ) .",
    "the spin dependent local density of states within the wigner - seitz cell ws of each site @xmath16 is : @xmath79 the spin density @xmath80 ( eq.([eq:2.6 ] ) ) is non - collinear . the new polar angles at each site",
    "@xmath16 can then be obtained for each point by @xmath81 or as an average over the local wigner ",

    "as an application of our method , we study the magnetic state of 3_d_atom clusters in and on the ni(001 ) surface . in a first step , we study the adatom properties , which are already known from previous work . in a second step ,",
    "we perform calculations for 3_d _ dimers and trimers and use the understanding gained from the single adatoms in order to explain the results .",
    "our calculations henceforth are based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of density functional theory with the parametrization of vosko _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the full nonspherical potential was used , taking into account the correct description of the wigner ",
    "seitz atomic cells.@xcite angular momenta up to @xmath83 were included in the expansion of the green functions and up to @xmath84 in the charge density expansion .",
    "relativistic effects were described in the scalar relativistic approximation .",
    "first , the surface green functions are determined by the screened kkr method@xcite for the ( 001 ) surface of ni which serves as the reference system .",
    "the equilibrium lattice parameter of ni was used ( 6.46  a.u . @xmath85  3.42   ) . to describe the impurities on the surface ( later we refer to these as _ adatoms _ and to the impurities sitting in the first surface layer as _ inatoms _ ) , we consider a cluster of perturbed potentials which includes the potentials of the impurities and the perturbed potentials of several neighboring shells , with typical size ranging from 19 perturbed sites for the single impurity to 32 for the dimers and trimers ;",
    "in all cases , at least the first neighboring sites of the impurity atoms were taken into account in the calculation to ensure the correct screening of the impurity potential .",
    "test calculations have shown that this is adequate for our work ; this is a merit of the green function method , in which the correct boundary conditions of the host ( in our case of the host surface ) are included in the green function via the dyson equation .",
    "we consider the adatoms at the unrelaxed hollow position in the first vacuum layer , and the inatoms at the unrelaxed position in the first surface layer .",
    "the orientations assigned to the spin moments of the impurities are always relative to the orientation of the substrate moment , which we take as the global frame .",
    "this , in turn , depends on delicate physical quantities such as the magnetic anisotropy energy , which can not be related to the local properties of the small clusters that we study . in the present approach",
    "such effects arising from spin - orbit interaction are not included .",
    "the direction of the host moments must therefore be considered as an input parameter from experiments or from independent _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "3_d _ adatoms on fe(001 ) and on ni(001 ) have been already studied previously , using the kkr method@xcite in the atomic sphere approximation . here",
    "we repeat the calculations of 3d adatoms on ni(001 ) using the full potential method ( a detailed work on fe and co on ni(001 ) is presented in a recent article@xcite ) .",
    "we give a brief analysis of the results , which are basically unchanged , in order to use them as a step for understanding the behavior of dimers and trimers later on .",
    "a collinear calculation of the magnetic state of a single adatom on a ferromagnetic substrate can give in some cases two solutions : one with ferromagnetic coupling ( fm ) to the substrate and one with antiferromagnetic coupling ( af ) .",
    "one of these states will correspond to the real ground state , and the other to a local minimum ; this is actually a local minimum with respect to collinear variations of the magnetic moment , since the angle @xmath86 between the local moment and the substrate moment can not be varied in a collinear calculation . from total energy calculations of the two states , the ground state can be then determined . in some cases , when the intra - atomic exchange field is not strong ( beginning or end of the 3d series ) , only one of the two minima exists . on the other hand ,",
    "if non - collinear effects are included in the calculations , one of the two minima usually becomes unstable against an angular rotation of the moment , _ i.e. _ , it is then actually a saddle point .",
    "the full diamonds in the fig .",
    "[ adatom - energy](a ) show the energy difference between the af and the fm solution for 3d adatoms on ni(001 ) .",
    "the first elements of the 3d series ( sc , ti , v , cr ) are af coupled to the substrate whereas the coupling of mn , fe , co and ni is fm . sc ( af ) , ti ( af ) , and ni ( fm ) are characterized by a single solution .",
    "clearly , the af - fm transition occurs when the adatom atomic number changes from cr ( @xmath87 ) to mn ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "this transition can be interpreted as in the case of the interatomic interaction of magnetic dimers,@xcite in terms of the energy gain due to the formation of hybrid states with the ni substrate as the @xmath89 virtual bound state comes lower in energy with increasing @xmath90 .",
    "an explanation ( see fig.[alexander - anderson ] ) can be given in terms of the _ d  d _ hybridization between the adatom 3_d _ states and the ni substrate 3_d _ states .",
    "energy is gained when a half  occupied _ d _ virtual bound state ( vbs ) at @xmath36 is broadened by hybridization with the ni minority 3_d _ states , which lie at @xmath36 ( the ni majority _ d _ states are fully occupied and positioned below @xmath36 ) . for the early 3_d _ adatoms ( fig.[alexander - anderson]a ) , it is the majority _ d _ vbs which is at @xmath36 , thus the majority  spin direction of the adatom is favourably aligned with the minority  spin direction of ni , and an af coupling arises .",
    "for the late 3_d _",
    "adatoms ( fig.[alexander - anderson]b ) , on the contrary , the minority _ d _ vbs is at @xmath36 , and this aligns with the ni minority _",
    "states ; then a fm coupling arises . for our purposes",
    "we keep in mind that , since cr and mn are in the intermediate region , _ i.e. _ , near the af - fm transition point , their magnetic coupling to the ni substrate is weak ; this has consequences to be seen in the behavior of dimers , trimers , etc .",
    ", in the next subsections .",
    "the magnetic moments of the adatoms and ni first neighbors in the surface layer are shown in fig .",
    "[ adatom - energy](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "evidently the moment of the ni first neighbors is strongly affected by the adatoms . especially in the af state for mn , fe , and co adatoms , the ni moment is strongly reduced and the fm configuration is stable . as regards the adatom moments , due to its half filled d band the mn adatom carries the highest magnetic moment ( 4.09 @xmath91 ) followed by cr ( 3.48 @xmath91 ) and fe ( 3.24@xmath91 ) .    to understand the effect of coordination and stronger hybridization on the magnetic behavior of the adatoms , we take the case of impurities sitting in the first surface layer ( inatoms ) .",
    "we carried out the calculations for v , cr , mn , fe and co impurities . the corresponding spin moments are shown in fig.[adatom - energy]b ( green circles ) , and the fm - af energy differences are shown in fig .",
    "[ adatom - energy]a ( open diamonds and dashed line ) .    compared to the adatom case ,",
    "the spin moments are reduced , especially for v and cr .",
    "this effect is expected due to the increase of the coordination number from 4 to 8 and the subsequent stronger hybridization of the 3_d _ levels with the host wavefunctions . moreover ,",
    "the energy difference @xmath92 between the af and fm solutions is affected .",
    "the trend can be understood as follows . in the case of cr ,",
    "the reduction of the local magnetic moment m is accompanied by a reduction of the exchange splitting @xmath93 as @xmath94 , where @xmath95  1ev is the intra - atomic exchange integral .",
    "this means that , for the inatom , the occupied 3_d _ states are closer to @xmath36 than for the adatom . in turn , this intensifies the hybridization of these states with the ni 3_d _ states ( which are close to @xmath36 ) . at the same time , also the higher coordination number intensifies the _ d - d _ hybridization . the hybridization - induced level shift in the af configuration increases , and the energy of the af state",
    "is thus lowered .",
    "the same mechanism is responsible for the weakening of the fm coupling of mn inatom compared to the adatom .",
    "similarly , the stronger hybridization of the co  inatom _ d_states stabilizes even more its fm configuration due to the energy gain from the broadening of the _ d _ virtual bound state .",
    "having established the single adatom behavior , we turn to adatom dimers .",
    "we considered three geometries of increasing distance : dimers as first , second , and fourth neighbors .",
    "we will discuss the magnetic interaction between the dimer atoms and the resulting magnetic order , first looking only at collinear states and then allowing for non - collinear order .",
    "we will see how , in certain cases , the collinear state reduces the symmetry , while the non - collinear state restores the full symmetry of the system .",
    "non - collinear order is finally established for certain first - neighbor dimers .",
    "[ geometry - dimer ] represents schematically the different considered geometrical configurations of impurity dimers residing on the surface .",
    "we have investigated the dimer-1type of geometry ( the adatoms are first neighboring atoms ) , dimer-2type ( the adatoms are second neighbors ) and dimer-3type ( the adatoms are fourth neighbors ) .",
    "this allows us to monitor the strength of the magnetic coupling as a function of the distance .",
    "three collinear magnetic configurations were treated : ( i ) antiferromagnetic coupling within the dimer leading to a ferrimagnetic solution ( ferri ) , ( ii ) ferromagnetic coupling within the dimer with both atoms ferromagnetically coupled to the substrate ( fm ) , or ( iii ) ferromagnetic coupling within the dimer with both atoms antiferromagnetically coupled to the substrate ( af ) .",
    "our calculations include v , cr , mn and fe dimers .",
    "we found that all v and fe dimer types behave like the adatoms : in all geometries , both v atoms are af and both fe atoms are fm . on the other hand , cr and mn",
    "dimers show magnetic frustration . as shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry - dimer ] , both the cr  dimer-1 and mn  dimer-1 show ( in a collinear calculation ) a ferri ground state ( see table  [ energy - dimer ] ) .",
    "with increasing distance between the adatoms , a transition occurs to the single adatom magnetic behavior which is af for cr  dimers and fm for mn  dimers .",

    "an antiparallel configuration between the moments in a mn or cr dimer lowers the energy , because the occupied _",
    "d _ vbs of each atom hybridizes with the unoccupied _ d _ vbs of the other atom and is shifted to lower eigenvalues .",
    "contrary to this , a parallel coupling does not lower the energy , since there is no level shifting , but only level broadening of the majority _ d_vbs .",
    "since these are fully occupied , the broadening brings no energy gain .

    "is found ( fig .",
    "[ mn - trimer - front ] ) with the nearest neighbours almost antiferromagnetic to each other , but with a collective tilting angle with respect to the substrate .",
    "this tilting angle is induced by the ferromagnetic mei between the central mn atom with the substrate , competing with the antiferromagnetic mei with its two companions .",
    "the top view of the surface shows that the in - plane components of the magnetic moments are collinear .",

    "no non - collinear solution was found , while there is no change in the collinear ground state which is @xmath96 for the cr trimer and @xmath102 for mn trimer .",
    "one should note that the moments of the two first neighboring impurities are almost compensated in the ferri solution .",
    "the third moment determines the total interaction between the substrate and the trimer which has then a net moment coming mainly from the additional impurity .",
    "this interaction is identical to the single adatom ( or inatom ) type of coupling .",

    "emphasis was placed on cr and mn clusters , for which we found that magnetic frustration can lead to non - collinear magnetic order .",
    "the origin of the frustration is the competition of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling among the cr or mn atoms with the antiferromagnetic ( for cr ) or ferromagnetic ( for mn ) exchange coupling between the adatoms and the substrate . in this respect ,",
    "the result is different than the prototype non - collinear configurations arising from antiferromagnetic interactions among atoms in triangular geometry .",
    "we found that cr and mn first - neighbouring adatom dimers can show non - collinear behavior , while increasing the distance between the adatoms of the dimer leads to the same state as for single adatoms .",

    "the agreement for the tilting angles in the non - collinear state is good , but the heisenberg model does not capture the collinear ground state for the cr dimer .",
    "this discrepancy occurs because the heisenberg model is restricted to constant absolute values of localized spins .",
    "the trimers studied so far are characterized by a collinear ground state : @xmath107 for the cr trimer and @xmath100 for the mn trimer .",
    "the mn trimer has also a non - collinear metastable solution with an energy difference @xmath108  mev .",
    "we believe that the energetic proximity of the collinear to the non - collinear states is directly related to the weakness of the exchange interaction with the ni substrate . replacing it by an fcc fe substrate will possibly change the ground state drastically .",
    "work in this direction progress and will be reported elsewhere .",

    "<S> magnetic nanostructures on non - magnetic or magnetic substrates have attracted strong attention due to the development of new experimental methods with atomic resolution . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this progress we have extended the full - potential korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green function method to treat non - collinear magnetic nanostructures on surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on magnetic 3d impurity nanoclusters , sitting as adatoms on or in the first surface layer on ni(001 ) , and investigate the size and orientation of the local moments and moreover the stabilization of non - collinear magnetic solutions . while clusters of fe , co , ni atoms are magnetically collinear , non - collinear magnetic coupling is expected for cr and mn clusters on surfaces of elemental ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of frustration is the competition of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling among the cr or mn atoms with the antiferromagnetic ( for cr ) or ferromagnetic ( for mn ) exchange coupling between the impurities and the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that cr and mn first - neighbouring dimers and a mn trimer on ni(001 ) show non - collinear behavior nearly degenerate with the most stable collinear configuration . increasing the distance between the dimer atoms leads to a collinear behavior , similar to the one of the single impurities . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare some of the non - collinear _ ab - initio _ results to those obtained within a classical heisenberg model , where the exchange constants are fitted to total energies of the collinear states ; the agreement is surprisingly good . </S>"
