    "the search for supersymmetric particles is among the most important endeavors of present and future high energy physics . at the upgraded @xmath4 collider tevatron , the searches for squarks and gluinos , as well as for the weakly interacting charginos and neutralinos ,",
    "will cover a wide range of the mssm parameter space  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for the production of susy particles in hadron collisions have been calculated at the born level already quite some time ago @xcite .",
    "only recently have the theoretical predictions been improved by calculations of the next - to - leading order susy - qcd corrections .",
    "the higher - order corrections in general increase the production cross section compared to the predictions at the born level and thereby improve experimental mass bounds and exclusion limits .",
    "moreover , by reducing the dependence of the cross section on spurious parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ the renormalization and factorization scales , the cross sections in nlo are under much better theoretical control than the leading - order estimates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall review the calculation of the next - to - leading order susy - qcd corrections , by using the case of @xmath5 production as an example .",
    "the nlo results for the production of squarks and gluinos are presented in section  3 .",
    "we first focus on the scalar partners of the five light quark flavors , which are assumed to be mass degenerate .",
    "the discussion of final - state stop particles , with potentially large mass splitting and mixing effects , is presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the nlo cross sections for the production of charginos and neutralinos .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary of the relevant mssm particle production cross sections at the upgraded tevatron , including next - to - leading order susy - qcd corrections .",
    "the evaluation of the susy - qcd corrections consists of two pieces , the virtual corrections , generated by virtual particle exchanges , and the real corrections , which originate from real - gluon radiation as well as from processes with an additional massless ( anti)quark in the final state .",
    "the one - loop virtual corrections , _",
    "i.e. _  the interference of the born matrix element with the one - loop amplitudes , are built up by gluon , gluino , quark and squark exchange contributions ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : virt]a ) .",
    "we have adopted the fermion flow prescription  @xcite for the calculation of matrix elements including majorana particles .",
    "the evaluation of the one - loop contributions has been performed in dimensional regularization , leading to the extraction of ultraviolet , infrared and collinear singularities as poles in @xmath6 . for the chiral @xmath7 coupling we have used the naive scheme , which is well justified in the present analysis at the one - loop level .",
    "scheme are identical to those obtained with the naive scheme . ] after summing all virtual corrections no quadratic divergences are left over , in accordance with the general property of supersymmetric theories .",
    "the renormalization of the ultraviolet divergences has been performed by identifying the squark and gluino masses with their pole masses , and defining the strong coupling in the @xmath8 scheme including five light flavors in the corresponding @xmath9 function .",
    "the massive particles , _",
    "i.e._squarks , gluinos and top quarks , have been decoupled by subtracting their contribution at vanishing momentum transfer @xcite . in dimensional regularization , there is a mismatch between the gluonic degrees of freedom ( d.o.f .",
    "= @xmath10 ) and those of the gluino ( d.o.f .",
    "= @xmath11 ) , so that susy is explicitly broken . in order to restore susy in the physical observables in the massless limit",
    ", an additional finite counter - term is required for the renormalization of the novel @xmath12 vertex .",
    "these counter - terms have been shown to render dimensional regularization consistent with supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the real corrections are generated by real - gluon radiation off all colored particles and by final states with an additional massless ( anti)quark , obtained from interchanging the final state gluon with a light quark in the initial state ( see fig .  [",
    "fg : virt]b ) .",
    "the phase - space integration of the final - state particles has been performed in @xmath13 dimensions , leading to the extraction of infrared and collinear singularities as poles in @xmath14 . after evaluating all angular integrals and adding the virtual and real corrections , the infrared singularities cancel .",
    "the left - over collinear singularities are universal and are absorbed in the renormalization of the parton densities at next - to - leading order .",
    "we have defined the parton densities in the conventional @xmath15 scheme including five light flavors , _",
    "i.e. _  the squark , gluino and top quark contributions are not included in the mass factorization .",
    "we finally obtain an ultraviolet , infrared and collinear finite partonic cross section .",
    "there is , however , an additional class of physical singularities , which have to be regularized . in the second diagram of fig .",
    "[ fg : real]b , an intermediate @xmath16 state is produced , before the ( off - shell ) gluino splits into a @xmath17 pair .",
    "if the gluino mass is larger than the common squark mass , and the partonic c.m .  energy is larger than the sum of the squark and gluino masses , the intermediate gluino can be produced on its mass - shell .",
    "thus the real corrections to @xmath5 production contain a contribution of @xmath18 production .",
    "the residue of this part corresponds to @xmath18 production with the subsequent gluino decay @xmath19 , which is already contained in the leading order cross section of @xmath18 pair production , including all final - state cascade decays .",
    "this term has been subtracted in order to derive a well - defined production cross section .",
    "analogous subtractions emerge in all reactions : if the gluino mass is larger than the squark mass , the contributions from @xmath20 have to be subtracted , and in the reverse case the contributions of squark decays into gluinos have to subtracted .",
    "in the following , we will present numerical results for susy particle production cross sections at the upgraded tevatron ( @xmath21  tev ) , including susy - qcd corrections .",
    "the hadronic cross sections are obtained from the partonic cross sections by convolution with the corresponding parton densities .",
    "we have adopted the cteq4l / m parton densities @xcite for the numerical results presented below . the uncertainty due to different parametrizations of the parton densities in nlo is less than @xmath22  % .",
    "the average final state particle mass is used as the central value of the renormalization and factorization scales and the top quark mass is set to @xmath23  gev .",
    "the @xmath24-factor is defined as @xmath25 , with all quantities ( @xmath26 , parton densities , parton cross section ) calculated consistently in lowest and in next - to - leading order .",
    "squarks and gluinos can be produced in different combinations via @xmath27 .",
    "we first focus on the five light - flavored squarks , taken to be mass degenerate . at the central renormalization and factorization scale @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the average mass of the final - state squarks / gluinos , the susy - qcd corrections are large and positive , increasing the total cross sections in general by 1090% @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : kfac ] , where the @xmath24-factors are presented as a function of the corresponding susy particle mass .",
    "the inclusion of susy - qcd corrections leads to an increase of the lower bounds on the squark and gluino masses by 1030 gev with respect to the leading - order analysis .",
    "the residual renormalization / factorization scale dependence in leading and next - to - leading order is presented in fig .",
    "[ fg : scale ] .",
    "the inclusion of the next - to - leading order corrections reduces the scale dependence by a factor 34 relative to the lowest order and reaches a typical level of @xmath30 , when varying the scale from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "this may serve as an estimate of the remaining theoretical uncertainty due to uncalculated higher - order terms .",
    "finally , we have evaluated the qcd - corrected single - particle exclusive transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions for all different processes . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fg : pty ] , the modification of the normalized distributions in next - to - leading compared to leading order is less than about 15% for the transverse - momentum distributions and even smaller for the rapidity distributions .",
    "it is thus a sufficient approximation to rescale the leading order distributions uniformly by the @xmath24-factors of the total cross sections .",
    "stop production has to be considered separately since the strong yukawa coupling between top / stop and higgs fields gives rise to potentially large mixing effects and mass splitting . at leading - order in the strong coupling constant @xmath33 , only diagonal pairs of",
    "stop quarks can be produced in hadronic collisions , @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast to the production of light - flavor squarks , the leading - order @xmath35-channel gluino exchange diagram is absent for stop production via @xmath36 initial states , since top quarks are not included in the parton densities .",
    "the leading - order stop cross section is thus in general significantly smaller than the leading order cross section for producing light - flavor squarks , where the threshold behavior is dominated by @xmath35-channel gluino exchange .",
    "mixed @xmath37 pair production can safely be neglected since it can proceed only via one - loop @xmath33 or tree level @xmath38 amplitudes and is suppressed by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the qcd corrections proceeds along the same lines as in the case of squarks and gluinos .",
    "the strong coupling and the parton densities have been defined in the  scheme with five light flavors contributing to their scale dependences , while the stop masses are renormalized on - shell .",
    "the magnitude of the susy - qcd corrections is illustrated by the @xmath24-factors at the central scale @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fg : kst ] . in the mass range relevant for the searches at the tevatron , the susy - qcd corrections are positive and reach a level of 30 to 45% if the @xmath40 initial state dominates . if , in contrast , the @xmath36 initial state dominates , the corrections are small .",
    "the relatively large mass dependence of the @xmath24-factor for stop production at the tevatron can therefore be attributed to the fact that the @xmath40 initial state is important for small @xmath41 , whereas the @xmath36 initial state dominates for large @xmath41 .    in complete analogy to the squark / gluino case ,",
    "the scale dependence of the stop cross section is strongly reduced , to about 15% at next - to - leading order in the interval @xmath42 .",
    "the virtual corrections at the nlo level depend on the stop mixing angle , the squark and gluino masses , and on the mass of the second stop particle .",
    "it turns out , however , that these dependences are very weak for canonical susy masses and can safely be neglected , as can be inferred from the light - stop production cross section in fig .",
    "[ fg : kst ] . on the other hand , internal particles with masses smaller than the external particle mass ,",
    "e.g. a light stop state propagating in the loops for heavy stop production , will contribute to the cross section .",
    "this feature explains the small but noticeable difference between the @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath24-factors at @xmath45  gev shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : kst ] .    the next - to - leading order transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fg : tpty ] .",
    "while the shape of the rapidity distribution is almost identical at leading and next - to - leading order , the transverse momentum carried away by hard gluon radiation in higher orders softens the nlo transverse momentum distribution considerably .",
    "at leading order , the production cross sections for chargino and neutralino final states depend on several mssm parameters , _",
    "i.e._@xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the cross sections are sizeable for chargino / neutralino masses below about 100 gev at the upgraded tevatron . due to the strong sensitivity to the mssm parameters , the extracted bounds on the chargino and neutralino masses depend on the specific region in the mssm parameter space @xcite .",
    "the outline of the determination of the qcd corrections is analogous to the previous cases of squarks , gluinos and stops .",
    "the resonance contributions due to @xmath48 with @xmath49 have to be subtracted in order to avoid double counting of the associated production of electroweak gauginos and strongly interacting squarks .",
    "the parton densities have been defined with five light flavors contributing to their scale evolution in the  scheme , while the @xmath35-channel squark masses have been renormalized on - shell .    at the average mass scale , the qcd corrections",
    "enhance the production cross sections of charginos and neutralinos typically by about 1035% ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : kgausc ] ) , depending in detail on the final state and the choice of mssm parameters .",
    "the leading order scale dependence is reduced to about 10% at next - to - leading order ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : kgausc ] ) , which implies a significant stabilization of the theoretical prediction for the production cross sections @xcite .",
    "the individual leading order contributions of the @xmath50-channel gauge boson and the @xmath51-channel squark exchange are presented in fig .",
    "[ fg : gauind ] . for neutralino pair production",
    "the @xmath52-channel contributions are by far dominating , while the @xmath50-channel and interference terms are suppressed .",
    "since the @xmath53 states are predominantly gaugino - like , this reflects the absence of a purely neutral trilinear gauge boson coupling in the standard model .",
    "contrary to that the @xmath50-channel of @xmath54 production is dominant and the @xmath52-channel term is suppressed for large squark masses .",
    "however , the interference turns out to be sizeable .",
    "we have reviewed the status of susy particle production at the upgraded tevatron at next - to - leading order in supersymmetric qcd .",
    "a collection of relevant sparticle production cross sections is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : sum_tev ] .",
    "the higher - order corrections at the average mass scale of the massive final - state particles significantly increase the production cross section compared to the predictions at the born level .",
    "experimental mass bounds are therefore shifted upwards .",
    "moreover , the theoretical uncertainties due to variation of renormalization / factorization scales are strongly reduced to a level of typically @xmath22  % , so that the cross sections in next - to - leading order susy - qcd are under much better theoretical control than the leading order estimates .",
