    "searching for novel topological phase is at the frontier of condensed matter research  @xcite .",

    "[ merged].,width=302,height=264 ]    it was recently indicated that haldane insulator ( hi ) can appear in one - dimensional bosonic systems  @xcite . the bosonic hi phase was initially found for dipolar bosons  @xcite and later in the extended bose - hubbard model which includes a nearest - neighbor boson - boson repulsion  @xcite .",
    "these his were determined in the case of unity filling , where dominant occupation numbers are @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the bosonic hi is therefore a reminiscent of the haldane phase conjectured for spin-@xmath6 systems whose local spin variables are @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite . in a topological aspect , the haldane phase is protected by the lattice inversion symmetry and can be classified as a symmetry - protected topological phase  @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic example of fermionic tsf is the inhomogeneous topological superfluidity which features modulated particle density and inhomogeneous sf on one - dimensional lattices  @xcite .",
    "recall that the single - chain extended bose - hubbard model hosts a homogenous sf phase  @xcite .",
    "when two such sf chains are coupled by an onsite repulsive interaction , the particle density modulation may arise along each chain .",
    "the superfluidity thus becomes inhomogeneous and is possibly compatible with the non - local haldane order . as a result , a novel bosonic tsf phase , which we call haldane superfluid ( hsf ) phase , may emerge .",

    "one can imagine two scenarios on interchain correlations : ( i ) , the symmetry between the chains is broken and the bosons on one chain become sf and on the other form hi ; ( ii ) , superfluidity and haldane string order are both present in either chain . to distinguish between these possibilities and get an in - depth understanding of hsf , we calculate two types of interchain correlations : @xmath67 where we set @xmath68 ; the symbols t and b indicate that the measurements are taken on top and bottom chains , respectively . as shown in fig .",

    "[ merged](b ) and ( c ) , we demonstrate how the non - local haldane order and the cdw order vary as the chain number increases .",
    "it is found that the non - local orders in hi and hsf phases are both stable and nearly unchanged within the uncertainties indicated by error bars .",
    "our proposal serves as a rather controllable approach to realize the tsf , without any involvement of spin - orbit coupling and zeeman field .",
    "the existence of the hsf is directly testable by cold bosons in a two - leg optical ladder , where boson - boson interactions can be tuned via feshbach resonances .",

    "@xcite , the non - local characteristics of cold bosons can be measured on either leg of an optical ladder .",
    "the other realization of the present hamiltonian may be the bosonic mixture on an optical lattice , which is achievable within state - of - the - art experimental capabilities  @xcite .",
    "finally , we wish to remark that there are rare examples of coexisting diagonal and off - diagonal orders in many - body systems . a paradigm is the ss phase on a lattice , which hosts both crystalline order and superfluidity , mostly induced by _ simultaneously _ broken translational and gauge symmetries , respectively  @xcite .",
