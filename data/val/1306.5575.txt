    "dense cores of molecular clouds are the basic units for the formation of sun - like , low - mass stars .",
    "a fundamental question about these cores that has not been answered conclusively is : are they long - lived entities or simply transient objects that disappear in one free - fall time or less ?",
    "the core lifetime is important to determine , because it affects the rate of star formation as well as the time available for chemical reactions , which in turn affect the chemical structure of not only the cores themselves but also the disks ( and perhaps even objects such as comets ) that form out of them @xcite .",
    "it also has implications on how the cores are formed @xcite .",
    "if the cores are relatively long lived , it would favor those formation scenarios that involve persistent support against gravity from , for example , magnetic fields @xcite , or long mass - accumulation time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the core lifetime turns out comparable to the free - fall time or less , then rapid formation and collapse , through for example turbulent compression , would be preferred @xcite .",
    "one way to constrain the core lifetime is to compare the number of starless cores to that of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , whose lifetimes can be independently estimated @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that cores of @xmath7@xmath8  @xmath9 typically last for @xmath10 25 free - fall times .",
    "such estimates depend , however , on the lifetimes of ysos , which are uncertain . here",
    ", we explore another , completely independent , way of constraining the core lifetime , through the grain growth implied by the recently discovered phenomenon of ` coreshine . '",
    "the so - called ` coreshine ' refers to the emission at mid - infrared [ especially the 3.6 @xmath0 _",
    "infrared array camera ( irac ) band ] from deep inside dense cores of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "it is found in about half of the cores where the emission is searched for @xcite .",
    "the emission is thought to come from light scattered by dust grains up to 1  @xmath0 in size .",
    "such grains are much larger than those in the diffuse interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mrn ) .",
    "since it takes time for small mrn - type grains to grow to @xmath0-size , the observed coreshine should provide a constraint on the core lifetime .",
    "the goal of our investigation is to quantify this constraint .",
    "specifically , we want to answer the question : how long does it take for the grains in a dense core to grow to @xmath0-size at a given density ?",
    "grain growth through coagulation has been studied for a long time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even before the discovery of coreshine , @xcite was able to demonstrate that coagulation can in principle produce @xmath0-sized grains in dense cores , provided that the grains are coated by ` sticky ' materials such as water ice and that the cores are relatively long - lived ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in this paper , we aim to strengthen @xcite s results by deriving a robust lower limit to the lifetimes for those cores with @xmath0-sized grains inferred from coreshine through a simple framework that isolates the essential physics of coagulation .",
    "we find that cores of typical density @xmath8  @xmath9 must last for at least a few free - fall times in order to produce @xmath0-sized grains .",
    "our coagulation models are explained in section  [ sec : model ] and the results are described in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the robustness and implication of the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the time evolution of grain size distribution by coagulation in a dense core .",
    "we adopt the formulation used in our previous paper , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , with some changes to make it suitable for our purpose .",
    "we briefly summarize the formulation here , and refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "we assume that the grains are spherical with a constant material density @xmath11 .",
    "we define the grain size distribution such that @xmath12 is the number density of grains whose radii are between @xmath13 and @xmath14 at time @xmath1 . for numerical calculation",
    ", we consider @xmath15 discrete logarithmic bins for the grain radius ( or mass ) , and solve the discretized coagulation equation . in considering the grain ",
    "grain collision rate between two grains with radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we estimate the relative velocity by @xmath18 where the grain velocity as a function of grain radius , @xmath19 , is given below in equation ( [ eq : v_turb ] ) , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is an angle between the two grain velocities ) is randomly chosen between @xmath22 and 1 in each time - step , , 0 , and 1 .",
    "such a discrete treatment of @xmath23 cause artificial spikes in the grain size distribution . ] and the cross - section by @xmath24 where @xmath5 is the enhanced factor of cross - section , which represents the increase of cross - section by non - compact aggregates .",
    "note that we always define the grain radius @xmath13 and the grain material density @xmath11 for the compact geometry , even if @xmath25 , to avoid the extra uncertainty caused by the grain geometry [ see also the comment in the item ( iii ) in section [ subsec : initial ] ] .",
    "we adopt the turbulence - driven grain velocity derived by @xcite , who assume that the driving scales of turbulence is given by the jeans length and that the typical velocity of the largest eddies ( @xmath10 the jeans length ) is given by the sound speed ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gas temperature assumed to be 10 k in this paper .",
    "thermal velocities are small enough to be neglected .",
    "the robustness of our conclusion in terms of the grain velocity is further discussed in section [ subsec : threshold ] .",
    "the form of equation ( [ eq : v12 ] ) suggests that the motions of dust particles are random .",
    "this treatment is not valid in general , since turbulent motions are correlated .",
    "however , we do not include the full treatment of the probability distribution function of the true relative particle velocity in turbulence for the following three reasons : ( i ) our simple formulation is sufficient to give a lower limit for the coagulation time - scale ( section [ subsec : threshold ] ) .",
    "( ii ) the probability distribution function of the true relative particle velocity in turbulence is unknown , and has only recently been investigated @xcite .",
    "( iii ) in the environments of interest to this paper , the forcing of turbulent eddies can be represented by a model where the particle motions experience ` random kicks ' : in this so - called ` intermediate regime ' @xcite , the prescription given by equation ( [ eq : v12 ] ) is applicable .",
    "indeed , we can confirm that the condition for the intermediate regime is satisfied as follows .",
    "the intermediate regime is defined by @xmath28 , where re is the reynolds number and st is the stokes number @xcite .",
    "this condition is translated into @xmath29 .",
    "since we are interested in the range of grain radius , @xmath30 , the intermediate regime is applicable to the density range considered in this paper .",
    "we adopt the following coagulation threshold velocity , @xmath31 , given by @xcite @xmath32^{1/2 } \\frac{\\gamma^{5/6}}{\\mathcal{e}^{\\star 1/3}r_{ki}^{5/6}\\rho_\\mathrm{gr}^{1/2}}\\ , , \\label{eq : vcoag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the surface energy per unit area , @xmath34 is the reduced radius of the grains , @xmath35 is the the reduced elastic modulus .",
    "this coagulation threshold is valid for collision between two homogeneous spheres and would not be applicable to collisions between aggregates . at low velocities , grains stick with each other and develop a non - compact or fluffy aggregates .",
    "these aggregates stick with each other at low relative velocities , and start to deform or bounce as the relative velocities increases .",
    "because the deformation absorbs the collision energy , the aggregates can stick with each other at a velocity larger than the above coagulation threshold .",
    "at very high velocities , cratering and catastrophic destruction will halt the growth @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we only limit the application of this threshold to compact spherical grains [ i.e.  cases ( i ) and ( ii ) in section [ subsec : initial ] ; see @xcite and references therein for a detailed treatment of coagulation of aggregates . ]      for the initial grain size distribution , we adopt the following power - law distribution , which is typical in the diffuse ism ( mrn ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the normalizing constant , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath37 is determined according to the mass density of the grains in the ism : @xmath40 where @xmath4 is the hydrogen number density , @xmath41 is the hydrogen atom mass , @xmath23 is the atomic weight per hydrogen ( assumed to be 1.4 ) and @xmath42 ( 0.01 ; @xcite ) is the dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "we adopt @xmath43 @xmath44 for the typical density of dense cores emitting coreshine @xcite , but also survey a wide range in @xmath4 .",
    "we normalize the time to the free - fall time , @xmath3 : @xmath45    to isolate the key pieces of physics that determine the rate of coagulation , we examine the following three models :    1 .",
    "we adopt coagulation threshold given by equation ( [ eq : vcoag ] ) with silicate material parameters ( @xmath46 g @xmath9 , @xmath47 erg @xmath44 , and @xmath48 dyn @xmath44 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the cross - section by the compact spherical case ( i.e.@xmath49 in equation [ eq : cross ] ) .",
    "2 .   we do not apply the coagulation threshold ; that is , if grains collide with each other , they coagulate .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that grains coated by water ice have a large coagulation threshold velocity @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath49 .",
    "3 .   as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the volume filling factor of the grains after coagulation is @xmath50 because of the non - compact structure of aggregates .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath51 [ @xmath52 . like the sticky coagulation model",
    ", we do not apply the coagulation threshold .",
    "this model provides a conservative estimate for the coagulation time - scale ( see section [ subsec : threshold ] for discussion ) .",
    "note that @xmath13 and @xmath11 are defined for the compact grains .",
    "in fact , the grain velocity ( equation [ eq : v_turb ] ) also has a dependence on the volume filling factor of aggregates through @xmath13 and @xmath11 in such a way that the non - compact structure enhances the gas  grain coupling , leading to a lower velocity .",
    "thus , the maximal coagulation model overestimates the grain velocity ( i.e.  the coagulation rate ) , which strengthens the case for the model being ` maximal ' .",
    "we present the evolution of grain size distribution for @xmath43 and @xmath53 @xmath9 at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : size ] for all three models : ( i ) the standard silicate model , ( ii ) the sticky coagulation model , and ( iii ) the maximal coagulation model . in order to show the grain mass distribution per logarithmic radius , we show @xmath57 .    in the standard silicate model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : size]a , the grain growth stops at @xmath58 because of the coagulation threshold : the grain velocities are too large for coagulation if @xmath59 .",
    "thus , bare silicate can not grow to @xmath0 sizes , a result found previously by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that bare silicate can not be the source of coreshine .    indeed , water ice has higher coagulation threshold , so if grains are coated by water ice , coagulation proceeds further @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we examine the sticky coagulation model , in which there is no coagulation threshold .",
    "( the coagulation threshold of water ice is separately discussed in section [ subsec : threshold ] to minimize the uncertainty in the material properties adopted . )",
    "[ fig : size]b shows that grains grow beyond 0.1 @xmath0 . for @xmath60  @xmath9 , @xmath0-sized grains form at @xmath56 , while for the standard density @xmath43  @xmath9 , the typical grain radius does not reach 1 @xmath0 even at @xmath56 .    in reality , aggregates are thought to form as a result of coagulation @xcite .",
    "thus , the cross - section is effectively increased compared with the spherical and compact case .",
    "[ fig : size]c shows that the maximal coagulation model in which the cross - section is elevated by a factor of 5 ( i.e.  @xmath51 ) successfully produces @xmath0-sized grains within @xmath61 even for @xmath43 @xmath9 .",
    "it remains difficult , however , to produce @xmath0-sized grains in @xmath62 for @xmath43  @xmath9 and in @xmath63 for @xmath60 @xmath9 .      as mentioned in introduction ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the condition for the formation of @xmath0-sized grains thought to be responsible for the observed coreshine @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "scattering dominates over absorption by an order of magnitude at @xmath64 if @xmath65 . since the peak of the grain size distribution in @xmath57 is well defined ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] ) , we simply find the condition for the radius at the peak , @xmath66 , reaches or exceeds 1 @xmath0 .",
    "we also examine a more conservative criterion by using @xmath67 instead of 1 @xmath0 , motivated in part by the fact that @xmath68 is the grain radius at which scattering is comparable to absorption at @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the maximal coagulation model with an enhancement factor for cross - section @xmath51 ; the result from the sticky coagulation model with @xmath49 can be obtained through a simple scaling . in fig .",
    "[ fig : condition ] , we show a grid of models with different core densities and times ( in units of the free - fall time at the core density ) .",
    "the solid line marks roughly the critical time @xmath69 at a given density @xmath4 above which @xmath0-sized grains are produced .",
    "it is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and 3.0 , respectively , if we adopt @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the criterion of micron - sized grain formation .",
    "the condition for forming @xmath0-sized grains is therefore @xmath74 .",
    "the same condition applies to the sticky coagulation model ( with @xmath49 ) as well , since coagulation time is inversely proportional to the cross - section for grain - grain collision .",
    "equation ( [ eq : condition ] ) can be understood in the following way .",
    "since coagulation is a collisional process , @xmath69 should be given by the collision time - scale , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the velocity and the number density of grains , respectively @xcite .",
    "the growth time - scale in terms of grain radius is @xmath78 ( note that @xmath79 is the time - scale of grain volume being doubled by coagulation ) .",
    "then , @xmath80 is evaluated by using equations  ( [ eq : v_turb ] ) and ( [ eq : tff ] ) as @xmath81 ; that is , @xmath82 ( 5.2 ) for @xmath83 ( @xmath73 ) , in a fair agreement with the above numerical estimate .",
    "thus , @xmath69 can be understood in terms of collision time - scale , which strengthens our numerical results .",
    "note that , to form @xmath0-sized grains in one free - fall time , the density @xmath4 must be of order @xmath84 @xmath9 or higher , even in the maximal coagulation model .",
    "in the sticky coagulation model , the required density would be higher still .",
    "such densities are much higher than the typical core value ( of order @xmath8  @xmath9 ) . at @xmath8  @xmath9 , fig .",
    "[ fig : condition ] and equation  ( [ eq : condition ] ) indicate that , under reasonable conditions , it takes at least several free - fall times for the grains to grow to @xmath0-size ( see section  [ subsec : longlivedcore ] for more discussion ) .",
    "the implication is that those dense cores detected in coreshine should be rather long - lived entities rather than transient objects that disappear in one free - fall time ; the latter objects would simply not have enough time to form the @xmath0-sized grains responsible for coreshine .",
    "-sized grains .",
    "the success and failure of the formation of @xmath85 grains in the maximal coagulation model are shown by ` o ' and ` x ' , respectively .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show the boundary of those two cases in the maximal coagulation model and the sticky coagulation model , respectively , if we adopt @xmath72 for the criterion for coreshine .",
    "the dot - dashed line marks the boundary for the maximal coagulation model for a more conservative criterion : @xmath67 .",
    "[ fig : condition],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      one may argue that coagulation would be faster if the grains were to collide at higher speeds than adopted in our model .",
    "however , it will be difficult for this to happen because of the existence of a coagulation threshold . as mentioned earlier",
    ", bare silicate grains already acquire velocities larger than the threshold at a rather small size @xmath58 ; they do not grow beyond @xmath86 under reasonable conditions . to grow to larger sizes , the grains must be ` more sticky ' than silicate , as is the case when the grains are coated with water ice @xcite . for such coated grains , we can estimate the coagulation threshold for equal - sized grains from equation ( [ eq : vcoag ] ) using @xmath46 g @xmath9 , @xmath87 erg @xmath44 , @xmath88 dyn @xmath44 .",
    "the result is @xmath89 cm s@xmath90 . for the micron - sized grains that we aim to form ,",
    "this threshold is already smaller than the typical grain velocity @xmath91 that was used in our model . in other words ,",
    "our model is already generous with the grain - grain collision speed .",
    "( collisions at the relatively high speed that we adopted may lead to the compaction of aggregates , which should reduce the enhancement factor @xmath5 for grain - grain collision cross - section and hence the rate of grain growth . ) .",
    "increasing the collision speed further should not lead to faster growth to @xmath0-size .",
    "for this reason , we believe that the critical time @xmath69 for the formation of @xmath0-sized grains estimated in equation  ( [ eq : condition ] ) is a robust lower limit .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : condition ] ) indicates that it takes more than @xmath92 free - fall times to form @xmath93-sized grains at the typical core density @xmath43  @xmath9 if the enhancement factor for cross - section is @xmath51 .",
    "if the enhancement factor is larger , the coagulation would be faster . in particular , if @xmath94 , the formation of micron - sized grains may occur in a single , rather than 5 , free - fall time .",
    "however , @xmath94 requires the grain volume filling factor to be @xmath95 per cent , which is extreme .",
    "for example , to form such a grain of @xmath83 with compact spherical grains with @xmath96 , one need to connect 1,000 grains _ linearly _ , which is unlikely .",
    "we doubt that there is much room to increase @xmath5 well beyond @xmath97 , which corresponds aggregates of rather low volume filling factor ( @xmath50 ) already .",
    "if the cross - section enhancement factor @xmath5 is not much larger than 5 , it would take several free - fall times ( or more ) to form @xmath0-sized grains at typical core densities .",
    "the long formation time would indicate that those dense cores with observed coreshine are relatively long - lived entities , rather than transient objects that form and disappear in one free - fall time .",
    "this estimate of core lifetime based on grain growth is consistent with that inferred from the number of starless cores ( relative to ysos ) @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the observational results that only a small fraction of dense cores show any detectable sign of gravitational collapse and that even those collapsing cores tend to have infall speeds less than half the sound speed @xcite .",
    "such slowly - evolving , relatively long - lived cores can form , for example , as a result of ambipolar diffusion in magnetically supported clouds @xcite , even in the presence of a strong , supersonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "they are less compatible with transient cores that are formed rapidly through fast compression by supersonic turbulence without any magnetic cushion @xcite , unless the core material is slowly accumulated in the post - shock region over several free - fall times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      large grains ( @xmath59 ) , once they are injected into the diffuse ism , are rapidly shattered into smaller grains @xcite .",
    "thus , there should be a continuous supplying mechanism of large grains @xcite .",
    "if dense molecular cores has lifetimes long enough to produce @xmath0-sized grains , they can be an important source of large grains . including the supply of large grains from dense cores will be an interesting topic in modeling the evolution of dust in galaxies",
    "motivated by recent coreshine observations , we have examined the condition for the formation of @xmath0-sized grains by coagulation in dense molecular cloud cores . we obtained a simple , conservative lower limit to the core lifetime @xmath1 for the formation of 0.5 @xmath0-sized grains : @xmath98 , where @xmath3 is the free - fall time at the core density @xmath4 and @xmath5 the enhancement factor for grain - grain collision that accounts for aggregates .",
    "the formation time for 1 @xmath0-sized grains is roughly a factor of 2 longer . since @xmath5 is unlikely much larger than 5",
    ", we conclude that dense cores of typical density @xmath6 must last for at least several free - fall times in order to produce the @xmath0-sized grains thought to be responsible for the observed coreshine .",
    "such cores are therefore relatively long - lived entities in molecular clouds , rather than dynamically transient objects .",
