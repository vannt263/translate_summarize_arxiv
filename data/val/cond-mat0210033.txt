    "<S> we investigate the crossover from the semiclassical to the quantum description of electron energy states in a chaotic metal grain connected to a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the influence of scattering off point impurities ( quantum disorder ) and of quantum diffraction ( quantum chaos ) on the electron density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both the quantum disorder and the quantum chaos open a gap near the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the gap is determined by the mean free time in disordered systems and by the ehrenfest time in clean chaotic systems . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , if both times become infinitely large , the density of states is gapless , and if either of these times becomes shorter than the electron escape time , the density of states is described by random matrix theory . using the usadel equation </S>",
    "<S> , we also study the density of states in a grain connected to a superconductor by a diffusive contact . </S>"
