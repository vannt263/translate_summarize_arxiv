    "@xcite recently , the rigid - to - elastic crossover was investigated theoretically in systems with @xmath0 dof in the high - temperature limit .",

    "a continuous or second - order crossover occurs when a saddle - point bifurcation takes place .",
    "for example , at the crossover from thermal to quantum decay , the static saddle point that determines the decay at high temperatures bifurcates into dynamic extrema ( instantons ) that have a lower euclidean action .",
    "this causes an enhancement of the escape rate @xmath1 for temperatures @xmath2 below the crossover temperature @xmath3 ( see refs .  [ 2,3 ] ) . in steepest - descent approximation @xmath4 and its derivative @xmath5",
    "are continuous at @xmath6 , whereas the second derivative @xmath7 diverges . in analogy to a classical phase transition",
    ", larkin and ovchinnikov denoted it a second - order crossover.@xcite they pointed out that for some potential shapes @xmath5 can become discontinuous at @xmath3 and the crossover is then of first order .",
    "transitions of this type were later investigated in more detail by chudnovsky @xcite and studied in various physical systems by others .",
    "@xcite the crossover from rigid - to - elastic decay is similar and both first - order and second - order crossovers have been found in systems with two dof .",
    "@xcite    the dof we study in this paper are macroscopic and coupled to their environment . at low temperatures , when macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) occurs , the interaction of the dof with the environment leads to quantum dissipation .",
    "@xcite among the experiments that have been successfully interpreted in the framework of mqt with dissipation are the investigations of the decay of metastable states in current - biased josephson junctions ( jj s ) and superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid s ) .",
    "@xcite the relevant collective coordinate in the case of the jj is the phase difference across the junction .",
    "the dc squid consists of two parallelly connected jj s and thus enables the study of the quantum dynamics of two coupled degrees of freedom , the phases across the junctions .",
    "the natural generalization to @xmath8 degrees of freedom are parallel coupled one - dimensional josephson - junction arrays , also known as discrete josephson transmission lines ( djtl s ) .",

    "@xcite to date , the interesting case @xmath15 has not been treated in the quantum - tunneling regime , neither in the overdamped nor in the underdamped case .",
    "solving the problem is difficult since then the saddle - point solutions of the action are inhomogeneous in time _ and _ space .",
    "two reasons motivated us to study @xmath8 harmonically coupled dof trapped in a metastable state .",
    "first , our model can be used to describe the decay of the jj phases in a djtl and in the continuum limit @xmath16 to represent a long jj .",
    "the second reason is the need to analyze the so far undiscussed overdamped limit .",
    "since the decay close to the rigid - to - elastic crossover is determined by the long - wavelength excitations of the system , much insight can be gained from studying dc squid s .",
    "experiments on dc squid s ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) showed that at high currents the classical decay mainly proceeds via the simultaneous activation of both phases across a common saddle point in the potential - energy landscape .",
    "however , below a crossover current , it was found that this saddle point splits and the phases decay one after another .",
    "@xcite a similar phenomenon was proposed to occur in the quantum decay process in underdamped @xcite and overdamped @xcite squid s , known as the instanton splitting . in this case , the common saddle point of the euclidean action bifurcates into two saddles of lower action .",
    "in addition , a regime was found , where upon tuning temperature or current a first - order transition takes place before the saddle - point bifurcation occurs .",
    "the rigid - to - elastic crossover in djtl s is similar . of course , instead of two dof , one then has @xmath0 coupled dof and the theory has to be generalized accordingly .",
    "a perturbative treatment to calculate the elastic instanton solutions of the euclidean action has been sketched in refs .  [",

    "three energy scales determine the decay behavior of the system ; the temperature , the barrier height of the trap and the interaction between the particles . accordingly , one finds four different regimes for the decay rate which we summarized in a decay diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] . to calculate the decay rate we use the thermodynamic method . in the saddle - point approximation , the decay",
    "is then determined by the most probable configurations leading to an escape from the trap which are given by the saddle points of the euclidean action . in the thermal regime",

    "@xcite if the interaction between the dof is strong compared to the barrier energy , rigid configurations dominate the decay . reducing the bias current ,",
    "the barrier becomes larger and above a critical value the system preferably decays via an elastic configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "starting in the rigid thermal regime and lowering the temperature , quantum fluctuations become important and the decay most probably occurs via the rigid quantum saddle - point or single - instanton solution of the euclidean action .",
    "@xcite inside the quantum region , an elastic regime can again be entered by increasing the barrier above a critical value . in order to determine the nonuniform instanton solutions of the quantum elastic regime , we worked out an iterative perturbation procedure .",
    "we performed the calculations close to the crossover from rigid to elastic quantum decay analytically up to second order and realized the third - order calculation numerically .",
    "we were then able to give quantitative results for the decay rate including the quantum elastic regime .",
    "the behavior of the decay rate is similar for squid s , djtl s , and long jj s . in the rigid regime",
    "the decay occurs via a saddle point that is uniform in space and hence , the qualitative nature of thermal or quantum decay is not sensitive to the number of dof .",
    "further , the crossover from rigid to elastic decay is caused by the excitation of long - wavelength normal modes of the system , which are equivalent in the three physical systems discussed here .",
    "we want to emphasize that although our conclusions are drawn for overdamped systems , the reasoning and the procedure also apply for the underdamped case .",
    "indeed , on a qualitative level , the understanding of the quantum rigid - to - elastic crossover in underdamped djtl s and long jj s can be obtained on the basis of the theoretical work on squid s ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , in order to have quantitative results , one has to extend the theory following the scheme proposed here .",
    "one interesting aspect of the quantum rigid - to - elastic crossover is that depending on the current , it can be either of first or second order , whereas all other crossovers that we discussed are of second order .",
    "even more fascinating is the fact that this crossover is an intrinsic _ quantum _ property and can be regarded as one further evidence for mqt , if measured .",
    "experimental verifications of the predicted enhancement of the decay rate due to the elastic properties ( see fig",
    ".  [ rate ] ) are thus highly desirable .",
    "an experimental detection of the first - order - like crossover would be challenging , but seems to be difficult , because the cusplike behavior of the rate at the crossover is not very pronounced and occurs in a small current interval . in standard experiments , the rate is obtained from the switching current histogram .",
    "the current intervals of the histogram have to be much smaller than @xmath361 and the number of events per interval large in order to resolve the cusplike feature .",
    "furthermore , it would be convenient to perform the measurements on systems with @xmath362 dof since in this case the first - order region is the largest ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .    in sum , we calculated the decay rate of overdamped current - biased one - dimensional josephson - junction arrays at zero voltage ( including squid s , djtl s , and long jj s ) analytically and numerically in several distinct decay regimes .",
