    "aqueous ionic solutions are abundant in biological and chemical systems",
    ". often they play a prominent role in determining the properties of charged macromolecules that are immersed in them @xcite .",
    "the mean field theory of electrolytes , known as poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory and its linearized version , debye - hckel theory @xcite , are known for many decades and have proved to be useful and important tools .",
    "pb theory was applied in the study of colloidal dispersions @xcite , biological membranes @xcite , synthetic and biological polyelectrolytes @xcite , and complex systems such as dna - lipid complexes@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , pb theory is known to have important limitations .",
    "being a mean field theory , ion - ion correlations are ignored .",
    "in addition , the finite size of ions is neglected .",
    "these effects have been studied extensively using various approaches @xcite such as liquid state @xcite and density functional@xcite theories , simulations @xcite , field theory @xcite and other modifications to the pb theory @xcite .",
    "most of the studies of corrections to pb have concentrated on the so - called primitive model , where ions are assumed to interact with each other through the electrostatic interaction and a hard core steric repulsion .",
    "although this model can describe many effects that are neglected in pb theory , it still neglects some physical features that are present in real systems .",
    "most notably , the aqueous solvent is treated as a continuous medium , whereas in reality ions interact with discrete solvent molecules .",
    "solvent effects are strong especially in water , because the polar water molecules interact very strongly with ions .",
    "the most significant result is that the electrostatic ion - ion interaction is reduced by a factor @xmath1 at room temperature , due to screening by the dielectric environment .",
    "however the discreteness of the solvent results in a more complicated picture .",
    "when ions approach each other at separations of a few water molecular diameters , the effective interaction between them is modified considerably .",
    "1 shows the correction to the @xmath2 potential between two na@xmath3 ions in water .",
    "this effective potential was calculated , using a simulation scheme @xcite , for a bulk nacl solution of concentration @xmath4 , at room temperature .",
    "note that the short - range potential , remaining after the subtraction of the coulomb interaction , is oscillatory and predominantly attractive .    the possibility to calculate the effective potential between ions in water leads naturally to the model depicted schematically in fig .  2 .",
    "the water is treated as a continuous medium , with a dielectric constant @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the electrostatic interaction a short - range interaction is included between ion pairs .",
    "the short - range potential , denoted as @xmath6 , is taken as an input to the model ( from simulation ) , and can in general depend on the ion species @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the potential shown in fig .  1 is used between na@xmath3-na@xmath3 pairs .",
    "the effective potential is calculated in a bulk solution and thus depends only on the ion - ion separation .",
    "however , systems containing charged surfaces can lead to inhomogeneity or anisotropy in the ion distribution .",
    "the model described above was suggested in ref .  , and was studied in planar geometry using the anisotropic hyper - netted chain ( ahnc ) approximation @xcite in refs .  .",
    "in ref .",
    "we presented a simplified approach to the same model . in this latter approach",
    ", a term accounting for the short - range solvent - mediated ion - ion interaction is added to the pb free energy .",
    "the formalism obtained in this way is simple although less accurate than the ahnc approximation , and in particular neglects ion - ion correlations . on the other hand numerical calculations",
    "can be done fairly easily , and are feasible in non - planar geometries .",
    "in addition , various analytical results can be obtained , and the discrete solvent effects can be readily understood in terms of basic physical principles . in the present paper , which can be regarded as a follow - up of ref .",

    "the density profile is compared to the result of pb theory ( dotted line ) .",
    "the main effect is that the short - range attraction draws additional counterions to the vicinity of the charged plate .",
    "note , however , that the contact density remains very close to the pb density , as will be explained later .",
    "the increase of the counterion density near the plate is followed by a depletion further away .",
    "this can be understood in the no - salt case since the total number of counterions is fixed . in our case",
    "the salt concentration is low .",
    "the debye - hckel screening length is large compared to the gouy - chapman length and compared to the range of the short - range interaction , so the salt has a minor effect .",
    "the counterion density profile is also compared with results of the ahnc approximation @xcite that were obtained using the same short - range hydration potential ( ` x ' symbols ) .",
    "the qualitative effect is similar in our model and in the ahnc .",
    "specifically , both density profiles follow the pb density curve for the first few angstrms from the plate and show a considerable decrease in the positive ion density , relative to pb , starting at a distance of about @xmath100 from the plate .",
    "the maximal decrease in the density is approximately @xmath101 in our model and almost @xmath102 in the ahnc profile , both relative to the pb profile .",
    "the effect of the short - range ion - ion interaction strongly depends on the surface charge .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "the ratio of the counterion density and its pb value , @xmath103 , is shown for three values of @xmath38 .",
    "the effect of the hydration potential is very minor for small surface charge ( @xmath104 ) , where the ratio @xmath103 is approximately @xmath105 at its maximum , and considerable for a surface charge of @xmath106 , where it reaches approximately @xmath107 .",
    "as the plate separation decreases , the modification to @xmath108 is expected to remain similar to the single plate case as long as @xmath109 is large compared to @xmath110 and to @xmath111 .",
    "this can indeed be seen in fig .  6 , where a high surface charge , as in fig .  4 ,",

    "the behavior is different , and in particular the contact density deviates from the pb value .",
    "the effect of decreasing @xmath91 was found to be similar for smaller surface charge ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath120 , ) and for salt concentration up to @xmath121 .",
    "the most important effect on the density profile is that the ion density is depleted far away from the charged plates .",
    "when the two plates are highly separated from each other the ion density can be described , far away from the plates , using an effective pb surface charge .",
    "this effective charge was calculated in ref .",
    ", and is smaller than the nominal charge ( for example , for the surface charge used in fig .  4 it is smaller by a factor of @xmath122 ) .",
    "the reduced density leads to a reduced pressure , relative to pb , as will be explained in the following sections .",

    "the net pressure @xmath129 between the plates is the difference between the pressure inside and outside the plates .",

    "9b the ahnc pressure ( solid line ) is compared with the pressure obtained using an electrostatic and hard core interaction only ( dotted line ) . since the ahnc approximation accounts for ion - ion correlations , there are differences between the pressure curves in our model as compared to the ahnc approximation .",
    "however a comparison of figs .",
    "9a and 9b shows that very similar qualitative and even semi - quantitative effects of the hydration interaction are found in the two calculations .    a comparison for smaller @xmath169 is shown in fig .",
    "the solid line is the pressure in our model and the dashed line is the ahnc pressure .",
    "the dotted line shows the pb pressure . as in fig .  9",
    ", the qualitative effect is similar in the two calculations .",
    "since the ahnc approximation takes into account ion - ion correlations , the comparison allows us to assess the relative importance of correlations and discrete solvent effects .",
    "the results shown in figs .  7 and 9 indicate that discrete solvent effects can be much larger than correlation effects induced by the electrostatic interaction . for smaller surface charge , as in figs .  8 and 10 ,",
    "these effects are of similar order of magnitude . in the ahnc approximation",
    "the pressure includes an electrostatic term due to correlations between ions in the two halves of the system , in addition to the hydration and mid - plane density contributions . in fig .",
    "10 this term is of similar order of magnitude as @xmath155 , and is the main source for the difference between the solid line ( our model ) and dashed line ( ahnc ) . for larger surface charge , as in fig .",
    "9 , @xmath155 becomes much larger than the electrostatic contribution .",
    "when divalent ions are present in the solution , correlation effects become much larger than in the monovalent case @xcite .",
    "discrete solvent effects are also modified , since the effective short - range interaction between two divalent ions is different in the two cases . when the charge on the ions is doubled , the electrostatic interaction between two ions increases by a factor of @xmath170 .",
    "the ion - ion separation where the electrostatic interaction is equal to @xmath171 increases from @xmath172 to almost @xmath173 . on this electrostatic scale , the water molecular size ( @xmath174 ) is much smaller than in the monovalent case .",
    "hence we can expect the solvent to be more similar to a continuous dielectric medium .",
    "indeed , the correction to the @xmath2 potential between two ( artificial ) na@xmath175 ions in water @xcite is found to be purely repulsive , and is significant only at separations below @xmath176 , where the electrostatic interaction is considerably larger than @xmath171 .",
    "thus we expect discrete solvent effects to be less important than correlations in the divalent case .",
    "as discussed above , the hydration term becomes small at large @xmath91 , compared to the change in the mid - plane density . in order to study the contribution of the mid - plane density to the pressure ,",
    "let us assume that the plate separation @xmath91 is much larger than all other length scales in the system : @xmath177 .",
    "the two plates are then decoupled and the mid - plane potential can be written as @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the electrostatic potential at a distance @xmath109 from a _ single _ plate .",
    "we assume also that @xmath180 , which is usually the case when the surface charge density is large . at a large distance from the plate",
    "the single plate profile is a pb profile , corresponding to a renormalized surface charge @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "the contribution @xmath154 to the pressure can then be written as follows @xcite :    @xmath182    where @xmath183 is the effective gouy - chapman length .",
    "a similar expression holds for the pb pressure , with the nominal gouy - chapman length @xmath110 used instead of @xmath184 .",
    "we thus find that :    @xmath185    in ref .   an analytical expression for @xmath186 is found .",

    "the second term is linear , although small because @xmath199 .",
    "it accounts for the small difference between the dashed and solid lines at large @xmath91 in fig .",
    "the behavior of @xmath155 , the hydration pressure term , can be understood as follows .",
    "as a zero - th order approximation , the ion density is dominated by electrostatics and can be replaced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phyd ] ) by its pb value .",
    "11 shows that this gives a very good approximation .",
    "hence we can write :    @xmath200    where    @xmath201    represents the force between two planar ion layers separated by a distance @xmath56 .",
    "the following behavior of @xmath202 can be inferred from fig .",
    "3 . at inter - layer separations",
    "@xmath203 @xmath202 is positive ( repulsive ) . at larger @xmath56 the value of @xmath54 increases from its large negative value at @xmath204 to zero over a few angstrms , leading to a strongly attractive ( negative ) @xmath202 . a closer inspection of fig .",
    "3 shows that @xmath202 is oscillatory , due to the local maxima and minima of @xmath54 . as we shall see below these fine details",
    "are smoothed away when two diffusive layers of finite thickness interact .",
    "the behavior of @xmath155 in fig .",
    "11 can now be understood as follows .",
    "most of the counterions are concentrated near the two plates , in layers whose thickness is of order @xmath205 .",
    "note that @xmath110 is small compared to @xmath206 .",
    "when @xmath145 these two layers do not interact directly with each other through the short - range interaction .",
    "ions in the two sides of the mid - plane interact with each other , leading to a negative ( attractive ) @xmath155 . as @xmath91 is decreased towards @xmath111 , larger and larger ion densities come into contact through @xmath202 and the magnitude of the negative @xmath155 increases accordingly .",
    "the gradual increase in the magnitude of @xmath155 reflects the algebraic decay of the density profile near each layer .",
    "when @xmath91 decreases below @xmath207 , the magnitude of @xmath155 increases more rapidly , as the ions in the two layers interact with ions in the mid - plane region .",
    "the behavior of @xmath155 changes when @xmath91 decreases below @xmath111 .",
    "most of the contribution to @xmath155 now comes from the interaction between the dense counterion layers near the two plates .",
    "as @xmath91 decreases these layers are separated by correspondingly decreasing distances .",
    "the hydration pressure follows roughly the structure of @xmath202 .",
    "it is strongly attractive for @xmath208 and repulsive for @xmath209 .",
    "the fine details of @xmath202 are smoothed due to the thickness of the diffusive ion layers .",
    "as the plate separation decreases below @xmath210 towards contact @xmath155 tends to zero , as it should since @xmath211 .",
    "one implication of this result is that @xmath154 returns to be the dominant contribution to the pressure , even for high surface charges .",
    "another implication is that the short - range interaction becomes unimportant . as in pb theory , the ions in the region between the two plates become essentially a confined ideal gas , and their total number is determined by charge neutrality .",
    "thus @xmath154 coincides with the pb pressure matching the _ nominal _ surface charge density @xmath38 .",
    "this is seen clearly in fig .",
    "7 .      in experiments",
    "the actual surface charge is usually not exactly known , because the number of ions dissociating from the surface is uncontrolled .",
    "the pb charge is then fitted to the large separation behavior .",
    "this charge can be significantly smaller than the actual surface charge , as discussed above .",
    "the interpretation of our results is then as follows . at plate separations below approximately @xmath212 nm",
    ", an attractive force appears , due to @xmath158 .",
    "this force can reduce the net repulsion , or even induce a net attraction , depending on the surface charge on the plates . as the plate separation decreases below the range of the hydration interaction @xmath213",
    ", @xmath155 decreases and eventually tends to zero .",
    "the pressure then coincides with the pb pressure matching the _ nominal _ surface charge . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "this leads to an apparent strong repulsive force when compared with the pb curve fitted to the large separation behavior . as an example",
    ", the pressure corresponding to @xmath214 is shown in fig .",
    "12 as a function of @xmath91 ( solid line ) using a linear scale .",
    "the dashed line shows the pb pressure curve using an effective surface charge chosen to match the large @xmath91 behavior of the solid line .",
    "when the two lines are compared a strong ( apparent ) repulsive contribution is seen in the solid line below @xmath215 , and an attractive contribution is seen for @xmath216 .",
    "summarizing our results on the pressure , we find that hydration effects can be understood as arising from two contributions . the first contribution is the change in the mid - plane ion density .",
    "this contribution dominates at large plate separations and can be understood in terms of an effective pb surface charge in our model .",
    "the effective pb charge is smaller than the nominal charge due to the accumulation of counterions in the vicinity of the charged plates .",
    "thus the pressure is reduced relative to pb theory , using the same surface charge .    as an alternative viewpoint",
    ", the pb surface charge can be chosen to match the large plate separation of the pressure in our model .",
    "when this is done , an apparent repulsive force appears in our model at very small plate separations ( @xmath217 ) , as compared with the fitted pb pressure .",
    "the second contribution to the pressure is the direct solvent mediated attraction between ion pairs in the two halves of the system .",
    "this latter term can become dominant at plate separations between @xmath218@xmath219 and @xmath218@xmath220 .",
    "it can induce a net attractive interaction between the two plates when the surface charge is high .",
    "attraction between like - charged surfaces is never predicted by pb theory @xcite . on the other hand , mechanisms involving correlations",
    "can lead to attraction .",
    "several approaches have shown that ion - ion correlations can have this effect , in the framework of the primitive model @xcite . in practice",
    ", this attraction can be strong enough to overcome the mean field repulsion when divalent ions are present in the solution .",
    "when there are only monovalent ions in the solution , ion - ion correlations have a much smaller effect .",
    "another mechanism that can lead to attraction is the van der waals force , arising from correlations between the polarizations on the two surfaces .",
    "as we find in this work , solvent mediated forces , related to ion - solvent correlations , are another mechanism that can induce inter - surface attraction .",
    "in some cases ( monovalent ions , small separation , large surface charge ) they are the leading mechanism for attraction .",
    "a strong deviation from pb predictions is indeed measured@xcite between charged surfaces in aqueous solution at separation below @xmath221 .",
    "the force includes an oscillatory contribution , with a period corresponding to the water molecular size .",
    "this force is due to the structuring of water in layers between the surfaces .",
    "in addition to this oscillatory contribution , an additional strong contribution is seen , which is often referred to as the hydration force @xcite .",
    "the aqueous pair potential model of ref .   was a first step towards the understanding of this force .",
    "a more realistic picture will probably emerge if a proper effective ion - surface interaction will be included , in addition to the effective ion - ion interaction .",
    "in addition , the modification to the ion - ion effective potential in a confined geometry may also be important . in order to assess the importance of these effects , further simulation results are needed as an input to the model .",
    "the aqueous pair potential and the free energy ( [ eq : omega ] ) involve various approximations , which are discussed extensively in refs .  .",
    "nevertheless , the large modification to the pb pressure , as obtained also using the ahnc approximation@xcite , indicates that the solvent effects on the ion distribution are a crucial ingredient in the origin of hydration forces@xcite .",
    "the semi - quantitative agreement of our results with the ahnc approximation indicates that our formalism captures the important effects and suggests its further application in non - planar geometries , where the ahnc approximation is not applicable .",
