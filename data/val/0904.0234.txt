    "during the last few years atom - wall interaction attracts considerable attention in connection with experiments on quantum reflection @xcite and bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",

    "however , the role of magnetic properties of an atom and wall material has also been discussed .",
    "magnetic properties received much interest due to highly conjectural possibility of repulsive atom - wall interaction based on the finding @xcite that a pure electrically polarizable atom repels a pure magnetically polarizable one . keeping in mind that both atoms and walls used in cavity quantum electrodynamics may possess magnetic proiperties , the impact of these properties on atom - wall interaction deserves detailed consideration .",
    "recent ref .",
    "@xcite developed the theory of atom - wall interaction for the case of both a polarizable and a ( para)magnetizable atom near a magnetodielectric macrobody .",
    "this theory was applied to the case of an atom near a semispace ( thick magnetodielectric wall described by the frequency - dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "it was shown that the resulting potential of atom - wall interaction is very similar to the known respective potential of a polarizable atom interacting with a dielectric wall .",
    "it is pertinent to note that ref .",
    "@xcite deals with paramagnetic atoms which are magnetizable but have no intrinsic magnetic moment .",
    "this is what is referred to as the van vleck paramagnetism @xcite .",
    "it is caused be the deformation of the electron structure of an atom by the external field which creates the induced magnetic moment .",
    "usually such deformation leads to the diamagnetic effect .",
    "however , in some specific cases the paramagnetic affect arises @xcite .",
    "thus , the van vleck paramagnetism is of polarization origin and the respective magnetic susceptibility is temperature - independent .    in this paper",
    "we consider the impact of magnetic properties on atom - wall interaction for paramagnetic atoms possessing the intrinsic ( permanent ) magnetic moment .",

    "ii we derive the lifshitz - type formula for an atom with permanent magnetic moment interacting with a magnetodielectric wall starting from the known formula for two semispaces described by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "we begin with simple model of an ideal metal wall and frequency - independent magnetic susceptibility of an atom and demonstrate that for rb atom the effect of magnetic moment is negligibly small because the electric polarizability remains much larger than the magnetic susceptibility at all temperatures from 1 to 300k . for h atom",

    "thus , for wall made of ferromagnetic dielectric the correction to the casimir - polder interaction due to the atomic magnetic moment is larger than for other wall materials considered above .",
    "in the foregoing we have derived the lifshitz - type formulas for the casimir - polder free energy and force acting between the atom with a permanent magnetic moment and a wall made of different materials .",
    "these formulas express the free energy and force in terms of electric polarizability and magnetic susceptibility of an atom , and dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of a wall . using a simple model of the atom with frequency - independent electric polarizability and magnetic susceptibility near an ideal metal wall",
    "the analytical expression for the casimir - polder force was obtained .",
    "specifically , for rb atoms the influence of magnetic properties on the force was shown to be negligibly small , as compared with h atoms .",
    "we have also performed numerical computations of the casimir - polder force acting between h atoms with frequency - dependent electric polarizability and magnetic susceptibility and walls made of ideal metal , au , fe and ferromagnetic dielectric . in the first three cases",
    "the inclusion of an atomic magnetic moment was shown to lead to the decrease of the force magnitude and in the fourth case to the increase of it .",
    "although the impact of the permanent magnetic moment of an atom on atom - wall interaction was found to be equal to only a fraction of percent ,",
    "it is larger than the effect of the induced ( para)magnetic moment previously considered in the literature @xcite .    note that our analysis is not applicable to atoms under the influence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this is because the inclusion of the magnetic field changes the mathematical expression for the casimir force between the plates used as a starting point in sec .",
    "ii @xcite .",
    "in fact the most interesting configuration considered above is the h atom near a ferromagnetic dielectric wall .",
    "the point is that for metal walls there are supplementary magnetic interactions caused by the magnetic noise from johnson currents @xcite . in the case of an atom interacting with a dielectric wall",

    "<S> the lifshitz - type formulas for the free energy and casimir - polder force acting between an atom possessing a permanent magnetic moment and a wall made of different materials are derived . </S>",
    "<S> simple model allowing analytic results is considered where the atomic magnetic susceptibility is frequency - independent and wall is made of ideal metal . </S>",
    "<S> numerical computations of the casimir - polder force are performed for h atom interacting with walls made of ideal metal , nonmagnetic ( au ) and ferromagnetic ( fe ) metals and of ferromagnetic dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for the first three wall materials the inclusion of the magnetic moment of an atom decreases and for the fourth material increases the magnitude of the casimir - polder force . </S>"
