    "with respect to the former , we have verified that quadruple precision ( 128 bits ) arithmetic gives the same results as the usual double - precision arithmetic . to answer the question of convergence",
    ", we have perturbed an already well - oriented set of orthonormal tangent vectors for a well - relaxed system and have ascertained that the unperturbed and perturbed sets of vectors become identical again after a certain transient time .",
    "the relaxation time the tangent vectors require to reach their proper orientations has been studied in ref .",

    "the spatial localization of the fastest - growing perturbation described by the maximum exponent is a very general result .",
    "it is also found for particle systems interacting _ via _ soft potentials @xcite , although the details of the power - law dependence of the localization measure @xmath155 depend sensitively on the interaction potential .",
    "also continuous systems in nonequilibrium stationary states exhibiting rayleigh - bnard convection have this localization property @xcite .",
    "there it is found that the localized active zones contributing most to the perturbation vector for large positive lyapunov exponents are involved in the creation and annihilation of defects of the roll pattern , resulting in the breaking or reconnection of rayleigh - bnard rolls @xcite .",
