    "as astronomical and cosmological observations always demand higher sensitivities , importance of large focal planes with detectors at cryogenic temperatures ever increases .",
    "the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization , which is one of the best probes for studying the early universe  @xcite , is an outstanding example where such cryogenic large detector arrays are needed .",
    "recently , a few cmb polarization experiments have reported the detection of the faint sub - degree - scale b - mode signal , the odd - parity mode of the cmb polarization pattern  @xcite .",
    "the use of a large array with an order of 10,000 polarization detectors , such as the focal plane of polarbear-2 ( pb-2 )  @xcite , spt-3 g  @xcite , and bicep-3  @xcite , is essential for characterizing the b - mode power spectrum .",
    "the need of a large focal plane leads to a challenge in the thermal design , as large thermal load is expected from a large optical window .",
    "@xcite in order to keep the detector sensivitity high enough , efficient infra - red ( ir ) filters should be considered .",
    "one promising solution to this problem is to introduce an alumina plate as an ir filter with high thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
    "the alumina filter absorbs the incident ir emission efficiently .",
    "the absorbed power is conducted from the central region of the filter to the edge , which is thermally connected to the cryogenic stage .",
    "the thermal conductance of alumina in the temperature range between 50 and 100  k is very high ; three orders of magnitude as large as those of conventional plastic filters , such as ptfe , nylon , and black polyethylene .",
    "the temperature gradient and optical loading of the alumina plate are thus very small even with a large diameter , which is ideal as the ir filter material .",
    "a remaining technological challenge on the use of alumina ir filter is to establish ar coatings for a large frequency coverage .",
    "alumina is known to be highly reflective in the millimeter wavelength .",
    "we thus need an ar coating on each surface of the alumina disc .",
    "ar coating on such a large surface is easily peeled off owing to the thermal shock at cold temperatures . the aforementioned next - generation cmb projects demand multi - layer ar coatings on large ir filters with a typical diameter of 500  mm .",
    "in the previous studies , the polarbear group attempted to develop a two - layer ar coating method with epoxy on an alumina surface , with a diameter of 50  mm  @xcite . however , the epoxy and alumina cracked during thermal cycling . to avoid the cracking , stress - relief grooves were adopted to reduce the stress between alumina and the epoxy layer .",
    "@xcite this technology was also used in the bicep-3  @xcite group , which succeeded in making an single - layer ar coating with epoxy for a diameter of about @xmath0 .",
    "however , this method is expensive . also , it is not easy to maintain the thickness uniformity of the ar layers on the thin alumina plate .",
    "alternatively , the actpol  @xcite group succeeded in making two- and three - layer ar coatings on silicon lenses , whose diameters were approximately 300 mm .",
    "they tried and succeeded using the technology of subwavelength grating ( swg ) .",
    "it is theoretically possible to apply this technology to an alumina surface ; however , it is difficult because the dicing blade is subject to wear so that groove pitch and depth are changed .",
    "it is also difficult to make a large ingot of silicon .",
    "machining the material is also very expensive .",
    "yet another method studied for the spider project is a polyimide sheet as an ar coating on the sapphire with a diameter of about 250  mm @xcite .",
    "the spider method is very easy to perform and less expensive than the method with epoxy or swg . finally , the first application of thermal sprayed mullite as ar coating was made on a 50 mm diameter alumina disc   @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to tune the dielectric constant of a thermal sprayed layer by spraying microspheres and alumina powder with different ratios . a three - layer thermal sprayed broadband ar coating that achieves over a 100 % fractional bandwidth has been demonstrated on a 50 mm diameter alumina disc  @xcite ..    in this study , we newly employ the polyimide foam coating on the mullite coating described above to establish a two - layer ar coating method .",
    "we apply this technique to a thin and large alumina disc with a 460 mm diameter as an ir filter , and demonstrate the performance of the ar coating .",
    "we fabricated a 2 mm thick and 460 mm diameter alumina filter , and demonstrated the performance of the new ar coating .",
    "our development focuses on the use in future cmb measurements but the method developed can also be used for other applications . in section  [ sec : filterdesign ] we describe the design of a large - diameter alumina ir filter with our new ar coating method .",
    "section  [ sec : materialproperties ] explains our measurements of material properties .",
    "the fabrication process is detailed in section  [ sec : fabrication ] .",
    "section  [ sec : characterization ] shows our characterization of the ar coatings on a large - diameter alumina ir filter .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ disc ] and give conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to be concrete , our ar - coating deveopment targets next - generation cmb experiments , where typical requirements on the ir filter and the ar coating are as follows : @xcite    * the filter diameter must be extendable to 450  mm or larger ; * the ar coating is robust against thermal shock , so that it is usable in cryogenic temperatures ; * the uniformity of the additional optical path length due to the ar coating should be less than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the wavelength of the incoming electromagnetic wave ; * transmittance should be above 95  % at the detection bands , which we assume 95  ghz and 150  ghz with a @xmath3 fractional bandwidth for each ; * the 3  db cutoff frequency should be below 1  thz .",
    "the filter diameter requirement satisfies the requirement for a large focal plane with o(10000 ) superconducting millimeter - wave sensors .",
    "the requirement on robustness against thermal shock is important for use at low temperatures .",
    "the thickness of the ar coating is designed to be @xmath4 so that the reflected beam is canceled .",
    "the uniformity must be better than @xmath1 , which corresponds to a transmittance uncertainty of 1  % .",
    "the requirement on transmittance in detection bands comes from the design sensitivity of experiment .",
    "the requirement on the cutoff frequency is derived to reduce the ir emission whose main frequency range is 10 - 100  thz .",
    "figure  [ fig : af_config ] shows a schematic view of two - layer ar coatings on a large - diameter alumina disc .",
    "the design satisfies the typical requirements mentioned above .",
    "the ar coatings consist of the thermally - sprayed mullite , which has the index of refraction ( ior ) of 2.5 as the first layer and polyimide foam ( called skybond foam  @xcite hereafter ) as the second layer .",
    "a thin layer of low - density polyethylene ( ldpe ) is placed in between two ar layers as a glue layer .",
    "we employ the mullite as the first layer because the coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) is close to that of alumina .",
    "the idea of using the skybond foam for the second layer is a natural extension of the polyimide sheet adopted by spider , which was explained in the previous section .",
    "an important advantage of the polyimide foam is that the ior can be controlled by changing the filling factor of the polyimide , which gives us an additional tuning knob to optimize the ar coating properties for given observation frequencies .",
    "our example design for this study is optimized to achieve the highest integrated efficiency for simultaneous measurements centered at 95  ghz and 150  ghz with a @xmath3 fractional bandwidth for each . here",
    "we fix the thickness of the alumina and the ior of mullite , while the ior of the skybond foam and the thicknesses of mullite and the skybond foam layers are free parameters . for the design in fig .",
    "[ fig : af_config ] , the optimized ior for the skybond foam is 1.43 .",

    "we have measured basic properties of alumina , mullite and the skybond foam .",
    "the measurements include thicknesses , iors , and the loss tangent values .",
    "table  [ material ] summarizes our results .",
    "the ior and the loss tangent are obtained from transmission measurements .",
    "a detailed description of the measurement system is available elsewhere  @xcite . the beam at millimeter wavelength ( 72 - 108  ghz and 108 - 148  ghz ) is produced by a signal generator with a sixfold and eightfold frequency multiplier@xcite .",
    "the frequency range of the signal generator is between 12 and 18  ghz .",
    "the beam is collimated by an ultra - high - molecular - weight polyethylene lens and the measured sample is placed immediately after the aperture .",
    "the transmitted radiation is detected by a diode detector .",
    "the signal is chopped at 13 hz for modulation with a lock - in amplifier , and the modulated signal is obtained using a daq .",
    "the detector is moved along the optical axis for more than a half wavelength to subtract the effect of a standing wave in the measurement setup .",
    "we measure the power with and without the sample and take the ratio between them to obtain the transmittance .",
    "the measured transmittance is fitted with the fresnel formula  @xcite . in the following sections , we describe more details on each material .    .",
    "basic properties of alumina and ar materials .",
    "the thickness @xmath5 , the ior @xmath6 , and the loss tangent @xmath7 are listed . our measurements for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are carried out both at room temperature and at the temperature of liquid nitrogen , whereas the thickness values are only measured at room temperature .",
    "the errors include both statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic errors mainly arise from the uncertainty of the ar thicknesses and temperature variations during the measurements .",
    "[ material ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we measure the transmittance of the alumina filter with the same setup described in section  [ sec : materialproperties ] at room temperature and at 81  k cooled with liquid nitrogen . since the uniformity measurements at room temperature gurantee that the fabrication process is independent of the size of the filter , to perform measurements with liquid nitrogen , we fabricated a sample with 50  mm in diameter to avoid mechanical conflict with the measurement system .",

    "the estimated emissivities are 2.7  % and 4.2  % in the 95  ghz and 150  ghz bands , respectively .",
    "the transmittance of the alumina filter at sub - millimeter wavelengths is measured using a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) with an insb bolometer .",
    "a mercury lamp is used as a broadband thermal source .",
    "the detailed description of the fts is found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the transmittance is measured from 200  ghz to 1,500  ghz at two different temperatures of 19 k and 298 k. we prepare the alumina filters with a diameter of 20  mm for the fts measurements .",
    "the measured spectrum at 19  k has a higher transmittance than the spectrum at 298  k as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ir ] .",
    "the 3  db cutoff frequencies of the filter are estimated as 400 and 650  ghz at 295 and 19  k , respectively .",

    "we have demonstrated that the ar coating method with mullite and skybond foam satisfies all the requirements listed in section  [ sec : filterdesign ] , which are typical in next - generation cmb experiments . although we have focused on the measurements at 95 ghz and 150 ghz , a future cmb satellite mission litebird  @xcite for example requires wider frequency ranges from 40 ghz to 400 ghz using two telescopes .",
    "skybond foam is tunable in ior and can thus be considered as a candidate technology for such a space mission .",
    "we have newly applied the emt in millimeter wave measurements to have the better surface model , which were not adopted in previous works .",

    "the performances of the new ar coating method described in this study are as good as those with epoxy with grooves .",
    "the fabrication time of the method with mullite and skybond foam is much shorter than the epoxy coating , which is a clear advantage .",
    "finally , this method can in principle be applied to curved surfaces , so that applications for lenses should also be considered .",
    "we have newly introduced polyimide foam ( skybond foam ) as the ar coating material .",
    "we show that the ior of skybond foam is controlled between 1.1 and 1.7 by changing the filling factor .",

    "we have confirmed that sample uniformity in the ior and thickness is satisfactory for 150 ghz measurements .",
    "we have also confirmed that the ar coating is robust against thermal cycles .",
