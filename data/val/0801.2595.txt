    "in 1996 , the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) was mounted on the 15  m diameter james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) near the summit of mauna kea , hi . since its commissioning , scuba allowed sensitive , widefield imaging of the submillimeter sky using the world s largest submillimetre telescope , itself located at one of the world s best submillimetre observing sites . during its lifetime ,",
    "scuba was used extensively by astronomers from the three jcmt partner countries ( the uk , canada and the netherlands ) and hawaii , but also by many astronomers from other countries .",
    "scuba operated for almost 9 years ; in early 2005 , it was removed from the jcmt after cryogenics and gas handling system failures .",
    "a large part of the decision to remove scuba , rather than repair it , was that a powerful successor instrument , scuba-2 ( see holland et al .",
    "2006 ) will be installed on the jcmt in late-2007 .    throughout its productive lifetime ,",
    "scuba was used to probe submillimeter continuum emission from a host of various astrophysical phenomena across the sky observable from mauna kea , from objects within the solar system to distant galaxies at high redshift .",
    "scuba data were made available to observers of approved projects immediately after their acquisition and were subject to a proprietary period of one year after the end of the semester of observation .",
    "after this period , however , the data were archived at the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) and made available to the public .",
    "( students working on dissertations with jcmt data could have this period extended . )",
    "scuba data are stored raw at the cadc , although preview images ( made with a simple reduction ) are available for individual files , allowing quick appraisals for data quality or source detection . over @xmath29 years , however , many objects were observed over several epochs by different observers and the data spread over several projects and files .",
    "submillimeter continuum maps could be significantly improved by optimally combining these separate data prior to forming final images .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a project to image almost all scuba datasets , using raw data from all epochs , to provide an archive of images at 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m that were reduced consistently by a single method ( i.e. , the  matrix inversion \" method described by johnstone et al .",
    "2000a ) and using the most current calibrations ( i.e. , extinction corrections and flux conversion factors or fcfs ) .",
    "the images are themselves available for download at the cadc as fits files ( see  8 for access instructions ) .",
    "we provide here , however , examples of some of the spectacular maps produced by scuba over its lifetime .",
    "in addition , we present catalogues drawn from these images of submillimeter continuum objects mapped by scuba , found using an automated object identification program ( based on the  clumpfind \" algorithm of williams , de geus & blitz 1994 ) . no catalogue of objects at submillimeter wavelengths akin to the the extremely useful catalogues at near- to far - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , the catalog of infrared observations by gezari , schmitz & mead 1984 , 1988 or the iras catalogues ( see beichman et al . 1988 ) currently exists .",
    "since the maps produced here are derived from previous scuba data , only a relatively limited amount of sky is covered ; the resulting catalogues are not  all sky . \"",
    "many well - known objects and regions were mapped extensively with scuba , however .",
    "the catalogues provide a context for understanding the voluminous maps that will be produced by scuba-2 , and are themselves a useful planning tool for future observations with new submillimeter and millimeter interferometers ( e.g. , sma , carma , alma ) .",
    "the catalogues discussed here will be linked with other catalogues at the cadc .    in the following ,",
    "we describe scuba in  2 , our uniform reduction procedure in  3 , and a global description of the resulting maps in  4 .",
    "in addition , we describe our object identification algorithm in  5 , the scuba map object catalogues and their contents in  6 , and several example regions in  7 .",
    "a description of the available data products is provided in  8 .",
    "finally , a summary is provided in  9 .",
    "a full description of the instrumental characteristics of scuba was made by holland et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . here",
    "we describe the instrument in brief to provide the context for the maps and catalogues .",
    "scuba was built by the royal observatory edinburgh for the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "it consisted of 128 bolometers arranged into two hexagonally packed arrays , the long - wave ( lw ) array with 37 bolometers and the short - wave ( sw ) array with 91 bolometers , as well as three additional bolometers surrounding the lw array .",
    "simultaneous illumination of the lw and sw arrays was achieved by dichroic beamsplitting , allowing for sampling at two wavelengths across 2.3  of sky in a single pointing .",
    "scuba s original filter set allowed for simultaneous observations in the lw and sw arrays either at 750 @xmath0 m and 350 @xmath0 m or at 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "( the 3 additional bolometers surrounding the lw array allowed for single - pixel observations at 1100 @xmath0 m , 1300 @xmath0 m and 2000 @xmath0 m . ) most scuba observations , however , were made at 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m , in part because the filter wheel became stuck at this pair in 1997 .",
    "all scuba bolometers were cooled to @xmath31 k , allowing sky background noise sensitivity levels to be achieved .",
    "subtraction of the sky was enabled by sampling off - target locations repeatedly during observations using the chopping sub - reflector of the jcmt .",
    "note that chopping has a profound effect on scuba data , as emission on angular scales larger than the chop throw effectively is spatially filtered out of the resulting maps . at 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m",
    ", the resolutions of scuba data were represented to first order by gaussians of @xmath214  and @xmath29  fwhm respectively , although significant  error beams \" were also present , especially at 450 @xmath0 m ( hogerheijde & sandell 2000 ; see also  3.1 below ) . these ",
    "error beams \" must be taken into account when determining fluxes ( see  4 and  5 below ) .",
    "scuba was used to observe the submillimeter sky in three specific modes . as mentioned above , at all times",
    "the contaminating sky emission was removed via chopping with the sub - reflector .",
    "the first was a  photometry \" mode used for maximum sensitivity at the location of the central bolometer , i.e. , the telescope effectively stared at a fixed location to maximize received signal from a single target .",
    "the second was a  jiggle \" mode , used to make nyquist - sampled maps across the scuba field - of - view , i.e. , the telescope was moved in a fixed pattern to positions offset from each other by fractions of the beam to fill in spaces between the individual bolometers .",
    "the third was a  scan \" mode used to make larger - scale maps at the expense of sensitivity at any given position , i.e. , the telescope was slewed over relatively large distances ( typically 10 arcminutes ) producing strips along the sky which could be stitched together . by carefully choosing the angle with respect to the bolometer array that the telescope moved , the spacing between measurements nyquist - sampled the sky .",
    "all three modes allowed differential continuum intensities to be measured .",
    "polarized continuum emission , however , could also be observed across the arrays by using a rotating quartz half waveplate , but only in photometry or jiggle mode .",
    "since the goal of this project was to make maps and then catalogue objects therein , all raw jiggle and scan data from scuba available in the jcmt archive were downloaded from the cadc in may 2006 .",
    "( photometry and polarimetry data were ignored . ) in addition , scuba data taken at wavelengths other than 850 @xmath0 m or 450 @xmath0 m were not retrieved .",
    "the downloaded data consisted of 35455  scuba data files \" describing for each bolometer the time of measurement , the location observed on the sky , and the measured voltage difference between that position and a specified off - position .",
    "the 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m map data retrieved should have comprised all those normally available to the public at these wavelengths , since the instrument had ceased operations @xmath41 year earlier . in total size , the raw data were only 78.7 gb .    further culling of the raw data ensemble was necessary .",
    "data of objects in the solar system ( e.g. , planets , asteroids , comets ) were removed since these objects have time varying positions , angular sizes , and brightnesses .",
    "such files were located by visually inspecting the list of unique  target names \" attached to each .",
    "( those interested in scuba maps of solar system objects at particular epochs can download them directly from the cadc . )",
    "in addition , a small number of data attached to peculiar target names ( e.g. , ",
    "whatever \" or  reflector \" ) were also removed from the ensemble .",
    "only 28534 scuba data files remained after culling solar system and peculiar objects . in size , these culled data were 69.9 gb .",
    "figure 1 shows the locations on the sky of all the scuba maps described in this paper ; well - sampled areas such as the galactic plane and nearby molecular clouds like orion and ophiuchus are clearly visible .",
    "atmospheric attenuation dominates the raw voltage difference measurements and the effect of such attenuation must be calibrated out in the data to obtain proper voltage levels for observed sources .",
    "the scuba data were calibrated separately at 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m using the standard orac - dr program , part of the starlink package ( economou et al .",
    "overall , 99.98% of the raw files could be calibrated with orac - dr without error , and the remaining were discarded .",
    "the baseline atmospheric opacity data for scuba calibration were obtained from a combination of skydips made with scuba itself and contemporaneous tipping scans made by a dedicated 225 ghz radiometer ( the  cso 225 ghz dipper \" ) located at the nearby caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "see archibald et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and weferling ( 2005 ) for wide discussions of scuba calibration and how these data were tabulated for use in reducing scuba observations .",
    "superior atmospheric correction utilizes a low - order polynomial fit in time to a combination of the two opacity determinations but was available for only 77.77% of the scuba map dataset . for the rest of the data , the cso 225 ghz dipper measurement , stored in the observation header ,",
    "could be used to estimate the sky opacity at 450 @xmath0 m and 850 @xmath0 m , although with much larger uncertainty in the conversion .",
    "given the importance of proper opacity correction , 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m maps were first made with only the @xmath278% of data where superior atmospheric correction data were available .",
    "these maps comprise the  fundamental map dataset \" and these should be referred to when interested in the most accurate fluxes . to expand the scope of the maps",
    ", additional 850 @xmath0 m maps were made using _ all _ available data .",
    "these latter data comprise the  extended map dataset \" and these should be referred to when interested in the widest areal coverage",
    ". the extended map dataset does not include 450 @xmath0 m maps because of the greater importance of accurate opacity calibration at shorter submillimeter wavelengths . in the following ,",
    "we treat the fundamental and extended map datasets equally , and provide catalogues derived from each .    with a nine - year lifetime , the weather conditions when scuba was used varied significantly of course .",
    "figure 2 shows histograms of opacity values at 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m from data within the fundamental dataset , demonstrating the spread of opacity values when scuba observed . as well as calibrating the sky opacity corrections",
    ", the conversion between voltage difference and flux must be determined .",
    "jenness et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that over extended periods ( typically semesters ) during which no significant changes to the telescope and electronics were performed , the flux conversion factor ( fcf ) was essentially constant with an uncertainty of approximately @xmath5 and @xmath6 at 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "most of the uncertainty is caused by changes in the telescope surface , due to temperature and gravity deformations , producing changes in the beam profile .",
    "the corresponding fcf values are tabulated and available for use in data reduction .    to facilitate the creation of useful maps , the sky was divided into square - degree regions ( actually each was 1.2  @xmath1 1.2  in extent , with 0.1  overlap with neighboring fields ) using galactic coordinates and the individual observations comprising the datasets were sorted into bins corresponding to these regions .",
    "the maps themselves , however , are stored in j2000 equatorial coordinates .",
    "maps of each square - degree region were then made individually using the  mapfits \" program using the respectively sorted calibrated map data as inputs .",
    "mapfits is based on the matrix inversion scheme described by johnstone et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , which produces better images from chopped data than techniques such as the fourier deconvolution ( e.g. , emerson et al .",
    "1979 ; emerson 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the matrix inversion method allows the combination of data taken with different observing setups , such as jiggle and scan observations .",
    "furthermore , data from specific bolometers are weighted appropriately by their respective associated noise levels .",
    "finally , the image fidelity and dynamic ranges achieved by the matrix inversion method are good ; see johnstone et al .",
    "( 2000a ) for examples where sources of known brightness are artificially included into maps .",
    "previously published examples of scuba maps made via matrix inversion include those of molecular clouds in ophiuchus ( johnstone et al .",
    "2000b , johnstone , di francesco & kirk 2004 ) , perseus ( kirk et al .",
    "2006 ) , and orion ( johnstone et al . 2001",
    "; johnstone , matthews & mitchell 2006 ; johnstone & bally 2006 ) .",
    "additionally , l1551 in taurus ( moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "2006 ) explicitly demonstrates the power of the  mapfits \" algorithm for bringing together heterogeneous scuba observations .",
    "pixel sizes for the 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m maps were defined at 6   and 3  respectively . for each square - degree region ,",
    "3 maps were created at each wavelength : an emission map with sky intensity pixels in jy beam@xmath7 , an error map with standard deviation values at each pixel , and a coverage map with each pixel containing the number of times its position was observed with scuba .",
    "the resulting maps are projected onto a tangent plane associated with the center of each square - degree field .",
    "a small amount of data had problems that required their respective files to be excised from the various square - degree regions .",
    "these problems included : i ) data listed as  not a number \" ( nan ) , ii ) data that caused segmentation faults when running mapfits , iii ) data associated with a ",
    "wrong number of bolometers \" and iv ) data with pixels of extremely high (  infinite \" ) noise . after discarding these files ,",
    "the corresponding square - degree maps were remade using mapfits .",
    "each square - degree map was further processed to remove artifacts .",
    "first , noisy edges in each map were clipped .",
    "since such edges resulted from there being relatively few observations at the associated pixels , the coverage maps were used to find pixels in the data maps at locations with less than 15 observations , and these were clipped .",
    "( the number maps were first smoothed with a gaussian kernel of @xmath8 = 7 pixels to minimize pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "note that the square - degree maps may contain data of different sensitivities due to differing integration times or opacity conditions during separate observations of nearby targets . )",
    "second , the data maps themselves were smoothed with a gaussian kernel of @xmath9 = 1 pixel to minimize pixel - to - pixel noise ; in effect , this increased the expected resolutions of the maps to @xmath219  fwhm at 850 @xmath0 m and @xmath211  at 450 @xmath0 m ( but see  3.1 below ) .",
    "third , the data maps were flattened to remove the large spatial scale variations that occurred due to imperfect cancellation of sky signal through chopping .",
    "flattening was performed by first filtering and smoothing the original clipped data map with a gaussian of large kernel size , and then subtracting this map from the smoothed and clipped data map . to prevent excessive bowling around bright sources , pixels with values @xmath10 the median noise in the original clipped map were replaced by pixels with values equal to @xmath11 the median noise .",
    "filtering was effective in reducing common artifacts where bright emission is surrounded by a bowl of negative pixels . for smoothing ,",
    "the filtered data map was smoothed with a gaussian kernel of @xmath8 = 20 pixels for the 850 @xmath0 m data and 40 pixels for the 450 @xmath0 m data .",
    "( after subtraction , edge pixels that had been previously clipped were reclipped . )    to improve flux calibration , processed maps that contained three point - like objects , hl tau , crl 618 ( pn g166.4 - 06.5 ) and crl 2688 ( the egg nebula ) , were examined .",
    "the 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m continuum maximum intensities and total fluxes of these three objects were well determined by jcmt staff for better calibration of scuba data .",
    "the comparison between the expected maximum intensities and those found in the processed maps at both wavelengths yielded correction factors that were applied respectively to all 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m processed maps .",
    "table 1 lists the expected maximum intensities of all three objects at both wavelengths , and the maximum intensities and total fluxes found in the processed maps after the respective correction was made .",
    "small differences between the expected and  observed \" maximum intensities and fluxes still persist , but these are likely due to small variations in intrinsic source structure , non - centering of the object maximum intensities in a single pixel , and variations of observing conditions between objects .",
    "as described below in  3 , the absolute flux uncertainties of scuba data have been historically @xmath220% at 850 @xmath0 m and @xmath250% at 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "each flux - corrected and processed square - degree map was visually inspected for quality . in some maps containing jiggle data , periodic structures ( i.e. , ripples )",
    "were seen .",
    "such ripples can be introduced to maps when data obtained with non - standard set - ups or during times of instrumental failure are included .",
    "( data were not placed into the jcmt archive with a quality flag . ) in addition , such ripples may arise when jiggle data are obtained with only one chop throw and angle , which precludes the kind of interconnectivity between data points that benefits maps made by matrix inversion .",
    "such data are susceptible to amplification of the chop signal during reconstruction .",
    "this effect typically does not occur over the spatial scale of a single jiggle map , but when many jiggle maps are combined to make a larger map , each with a single chop throw and angle , the opportunity increases for amplification due to degeneracy in reconstruction .",
    "unfortunately , many fields that were observed for high sensitivity to detect faint high - redshift galaxies , including the hubble deep field , the groth strip , and the shades fields ( the subaru / xmm deep field and the lockman hole ) were observed with a single chop throw and angle , and we were unable to produce satisfactory maps of these regions .",
    "all square - degree maps entirely containing such periodic structure , including these  cosmological \" fields , were removed from the ensembles after visual inspection .",
    "( those interested in such fields should look at the respective papers where the data have been very carefully processed , e.g. , see coppin et al .",
    "2006 for the shades fields . )",
    "square - degree maps containing regions of reasonable quality but localized regions with periodic structure ( e.g. , one with good scan or jiggle data in some locations but rippled jiggle data in other locations ) were retained , however .",
    "objects found from these maps at locations of periodic structure were removed from catalogues after further visual inspection ( see  4 below ) .",
    "in the fundamental map dataset , 1423 square - degree maps contain scuba map data at 850 @xmath0 m and 1357 square - degree maps contain scuba map data at 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "( note that 214 of the fundamental 850 @xmath0 m maps and 213 of the fundamental 450 @xmath0 m maps contain data only in the outer 0.1  of each 1.2   @xmath1 1.2  field ; these locations are also found within the central square degree in other maps of adjacent fields . ) in total , the 850 @xmath0 m fundamental maps contain @xmath27.06 @xmath1 10@xmath12 pixels for a total areal coverage of 19.6 square degrees .",
    "the 450 @xmath0 m fundamental maps contain a total of 23.6 @xmath1 10@xmath12 pixels for a total areal coverage of 16.4 square degrees .",
    "the smaller areal coverage of the 450 @xmath0 m maps reflects the fact that at times only the 850 @xmath0 m data from the telescope was stored during observations .",
    "( often this occurred during fast - scans , where the telescope was slewed at an accelerated rate and any 450 @xmath0 m observations were significantly undersampled . ) in the extended map dataset , 1547 square - degree maps contain scuba map data at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "( note that 234 of these maps contain data only in the outer 0.1  of each 1.2  @xmath1 1.2  field . )",
    "these maps contain a total of 10.6 @xmath1 10@xmath12 pixels for a total areal coverage of 29.3 square degrees , i.e. , @xmath250% larger than in the fundamental map dataset at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "figures 3 - 6 show examples of maps assembled from the data processed in this effort , for low - mass star - forming regions , high - mass star - forming regions , nearby galaxies , and debris disks respectively . these data , as with all data described here , are available for public use at the cadc .",

    "for the 1  maps , the 450 @xmath0 m beam contains a primary beam of 8.5  fwhm and 0.90 relative peak and the 850 @xmath0 m beam contains a primary beam of 13.5  fwhm and 0.96 relative peak .",
    "the values we obtain are consistent with those obtained by hogerheijde & sandell ( 2000 ) who used data of uranus from 1997 september , although they included a third , very wide , low amplitude gaussian in their beam models at each wavelength .",

    "( at both wavelengths , the secondary beam is of 40  fhwm and 0.12 relative peak . )",
    "these larger values are due to the effective smoothing that comes with using larger pixels but also due to the additional smoothing by @xmath9 = 1-pixel applied to each map to reduce pixel - to - pixel noise .",
    "the effective fwhms of the beams in each dataset are 17.3  at 450 @xmath0 m and 22.9  at 850 @xmath0 m .",

    "since the maps were taken over a variety of different weather conditions and methods , there is no common noise level representative of the entire dataset .",

    "also , for object identification ( see  5 below ) , we use the median noise per pixel associated with the individual objects under investigation and not the median noise values of each entire square - degree map .",
    "absolute flux uncertainties in the scuba maps were dominated by fluctuations of opacity above the telescope during observations and calibration .",

    "we did not utilize the 450 @xmath0 m maps to define objects given the lower accuracy of its flux calibration and the smaller number of 450 @xmath0 m maps .",
    "the identification of objects from submillimeter continuum emission is tricky because the emission itself can range in maps from being quite compact ( e.g. , on the order of the beam size ) to quite extended ( e.g. , beyond the chop throw angular distance , although on these scales it becomes attenuated by the observing techniques ) .",
    "in addition , such objects can be themselves either bright or dim and can be arranged in compact or diffuse associations .    to identify objects",
    ", we applied to every 850 @xmath0 m square - degree map the 2-d  clumpfind \" algorithm , developed first for 3-d cubes of molecular line data by williams , de geus & blitz ( 1994 ) and adapted for use on scuba continuum maps .",

    "since objects are defined only in terms of closed contours , clumpfind does not presuppose a particular source structure for its identifications , e.g. , gaussians .",

    "clumpfind returns its peak intensity and the position of peak intensity , as well as its total flux density and size based on the number of pixels within the closed contour of definition .",
    "clumpfind also produces a  object map \" that identifies pixels with specific objects . by using a minimum noise threshold in every map ,",
    "the algorithm was driven in a first pass to include as many object candidates as possible ; many of these had maximum intensities not more than a few times their local median noise levels , however .    after initial identification ,",
    "three criteria were applied to each object candidate to determine its reality as an astronomical source and improve the robustness of the object lists .",
    "first , objects were discarded if their peak pixel values were less than 3 times the median of the noise in the pixels that defined it .",
    "second , objects were discarded if their sizes were less than the areal size of the effective beams ( e.g. , @xmath148 pixels at 850 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "third , objects were removed if they were located near the edges of maps , where large scale fluctuations tended to remain even after flattening . for scan maps , identified objects with peaks within 25 pixels along the cardinal directions to the map edges were discarded if they were adjacent other sources that adjoined the map edge . for jiggle maps ,",
    "no such removals were done , given their innately smaller sizes . identified objects adjoining jiggle map edges , however , were identified as such ( see  6 ) , since it is likely they have been incompletely sampled or characterized ( if indeed such objects are real ) .",
    "note that since clumpfind depends on the noise characteristics of a given map to define objects , the objects found in the fundamental and extended map datasets may differ .",
    "for example , an extended object identified as single in one dataset may be identified as multiple objects in the other dataset .",
    "this dependence on noise is the reason why two object lists have been provided , rather than a single hybrid object list . as an example , figure 9 illustrates differences between objects identified in l1688 of ophiuchus in the fundamental and extended datasets .",
    "clumpfind is by no means the perfect method for identifying objects in scuba maps .",
    "it has , however , an attractive simplicity and generality that allowed it to be used on large map datasets ( johnstone et al .",
    "2000b , etc . ) other methods used to identify objects in ( sub)millimeter continuum maps include various wavelet decomposition schemes ( e.g. , see motte , andr & neri 1998 or knudsen et al .",

    ", clumpfind recovers well total flux densities in crowded regions of compact sources where blind aperture photometry is inappropriate .",
    "in addition , the clumpfind algorithm does not unnecessarily divide up extended emission into multiple objects .",

    "for example , johnstone al . ( 2002 ) found that most of the 67 objects identified by clumpfind in 850 @xmath0 m maps of orion b were largely the same as those identified subjectively ( by eye ) in the same maps by mitchell et al .",

    "regarding the completeness of the clumpfind algorithm , we stress that object candidates in various maps were identified down to very low noise levels in each map and then we used other criteria ( maximum intensity vs. local median noise , relative location within maps ) to preclude candidates from the object catalogues .",
    "we have not attempted , however , to quantify the completeness of the clumpfind algorithm , e.g. , by inserting artificial sources into the maps to determine how well clumpfind recovers such sources .",
    "the objects identified in the catalogues encompass a large variation of size and morphology , and the maps themselves can have large differences in noise both within themselves and between maps .",
    "such variety makes it difficult to make definitive tests for completeness across all maps . for reference",
    ", however , we note that enoch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) performed empirical tests for completeness using monte carlo simulations of the identification of artificial gaussian sources of various size in empty regions of their wide - field 1.3 mm continuum map of the perseus cloud , which had a reasonably small noise level across the map ( @xmath215% ) .",
    "such tests defined completeness limits in mass and size , and the @xmath2100 actual objects they identified by clumpfind in their maps study were bounded on the mass - size plane by an empirically determined 10% completeness limit , i.e. , the level where 10% of their artificial sources were recovered .    in summary , we believe our object identification algorithm does an effective job of locating real emission within the 850 @xmath0 m maps but it can not be considered perfect . the reality of any given object as an astronomical source in the fundamental or extended catalogues must be considered carefully by those interested in these data .",

    "given variations in weather and dish surface conditions over the nine years scuba was in operation , it is thus difficult to assign a specific pointing uncertainty to the entire scuba datasets . moreover , different observers may have used different schemes over time .",
    "for example , note the @xmath26  offset evident in our map of ngc 1333 relative to those made by sandell & knee ( 2001 ) from early scuba data .    to determine a pointing uncertainty",
    ", we compare the j2000 positions of the three point - like calibrators , hl tau , crl 618 ( pn g166.4 - 06.5 ) and crl 2688 ( the egg nebula ) as provided by simbad to the j2000 position of the pixel of maximum intensity at 850 @xmath0 m for each respective source from our datasets .",
    "not only are these particular objects compact with well defined maxima , they also have bright optical counterparts with fairly well established positions .",
    "( note that relatively few objects detected at submillimeter wavelengths have optical counterparts and correspondingly have relatively poorly determined positions . )",
    "figure 17 shows the difference between the expected positions at ( 0,0 ) and the location of the pixel of maximum intensities .",
    "note that there is no consistent directional offset between the expected positions and positions of maximum intensity .",
    "the mean magnitude of the angular offset between these positions is 2.7 , or less than half the 6  pixel size of the 850 @xmath0 m maps in the datasets , and @xmath214% of the 19.5  fwhm of the narrow gaussian component of the 850 @xmath0 m beam ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "( note that 6  is also equal to 1 @xmath13 of the gaussian representing the narrow component of the _ unsmoothed _ jcmt beam at 850 @xmath0 m ; see the bold dashed circle in figure 17 . ) furthermore , the angular offsets shown in figure 17 are only to the positions of the respective pixel of maximum intensity , which were used to identify objects in the catalogues .",
    "gaussian fits to the 850 @xmath0 m emission of each point - like source ( where gaussians are particularly effective ) yield even closer positional coincidence .",
    "for example , a mean angular offset magnitude of only 0.93  is found between the expected positions and those of the peaks of the gaussian fits to these particular objects .",
    "column 26 in both catalogues ( tables 2 or 3 ) lists tentative associations of each object with those found in the simbad astronomical database ( i.e. , known objects located @xmath311.5  from the position of maximum 850 @xmath0 m intensity . ) given the low resolution of the dataset maps relative to optical or infrared observations , which comprise the bulk of the simbad entries , we stress that these associations are tentative . for the fundmental catalogue , our original search through simbad of 7031 object candidates resulted in potential associations with 7882 simbad objects ; sometimes many simbad objects were found within 11.5  of the fmoc position . to differentiate between multiple potential associations , we chose objects in simbad that were closest to the position of maximum 850 @xmath0 m intensity .",
    "of these objects , an identifier in column 26 was chosen based on a either a name or entry within 8 catalogues ( ngc , ic , 3c , hd , sao , bd , or iras in decending order of priorty . ) out of the 7031 objects , only 1592 had associations with simbad objects .    to test for false associations ,",
    "all 7031 positions in the early fmoc were shifted north or south by 5  and these new positions were run through simbad .",
    "these new positions resulted in only 430 or 383 potential simbad associations respectively , much less than the 7882 found earlier . also , out of the 7031 positions shifted north or south , only 356 or 322 respectively had associations with simbad objects , again much less than the 1592 found earlier .",
    "from these numbers , we surmise that the probability for false association in the catalogues is relatively low , i.e. , only @xmath220% ( i.e. , 340/1600 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the simbad database is not itself an all - sky survey , but rather a collection of known objects .",
    "what is listed in column 26 only indicates tentative association with previously found objects .",
    "the 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m square - degree maps from the fundamental dataset and the 850 @xmath0 m maps from the extended dataset are available for download from the scuba legacy catalogues repository at the canadian astronomical data centre ( cadc ) at :    http://www.cadc.hia.nrc.gc.ca/community/scubalegacy .",
    "each emission map is in the standard fits format projected onto the tangent plane from its center position .",
    "each map file is named by the galactic coordinates of its center position .",
    "for example , the fits file  scuba@xmath24f@xmath24178d6@xmath24-19d8@xmath24850um.emi.fits \" contains the square - degree scuba 850 @xmath0 m emission map from the fundamental dataset ( f ) centered at ( @xmath25 ) = ( 178.6 , -19.8 ) .",

    "for example , it has ascii text files containing the fmoc and emoc , e.g. ,  scuba@xmath24fmoc.txt \" and  scuba@xmath24emoc.txt \" respectively .",
    "finally , the repository contains object maps where the pixels give the numerical identifications made by clumpfind for each object in respective 850 @xmath0 m emission maps .",
