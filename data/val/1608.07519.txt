    "a large body of work has already been devoted to the cgl equation , which reads : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex field .    in the context of amplitude equations  @xcite , which are large - scale descriptions of physical systems passed ( and near ) symmetry - breaking instability thresholds ,",
    "the cgl equation has been recognized as the relevant equation for the slow modulations of oscillations in a continuous medium near a hopf bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "more generally , it appears in the description of spatially - extended systems when oscillations or waves are present .        under the form ( [ cgl ] ) ,",
    "the cgl equation has been reduced ( without loss of generality ) to its simplest from , with only two real parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the first term of the rhs is related to the linear instability mechanism which led to oscillations .",
    "the second term accounts for diffusion and dispersion , while the cubic nonlinear term insures if @xmath4 , otherwise other terms may be necessary the saturation of the linear instability and is involved in the renormalisation of the oscillation frequency .",
    "two important limits are worth mentioning : when @xmath5 , one has the real ginzburg - landau equation , which possesses a lyapunov functional and thus exhibits only relaxational dynamics  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 dispersion plays the essential role , as one recovers the nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite . in the general case , sustained spatio - temporally disordered regimes are observed in large regions of the parameter plane ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the genericity of the cgl equation , associated to its relative simplicity , has made it one of the favorite playgrounds for testing ideas about spatiotemporal chaos in a rather realistic context  @xcite .",
    "it is only recently , though , that a comprehensive study has been undertaken , as it was realized that away from the intricacy of the bifurcation diagrams at small sizes , there exists a crossover size beyond which chaos becomes extensive and can be characterized by intensive quantities independent of system size , boundary conditions , and , to a large extent , initial conditions  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "when chaos is extensive , statistical approaches are legitimate and should provide rather simple descriptions . in this context ,",
    "bifurcation diagrams typically used for small dynamical systems are replaced by `` phase diagrams '' delimiting the regions of different statistical signatures in parameter space .    whereas the one - dimensional case is now rather well known  @xcite , the situation in two dimensions is much less satisfactory , mainly because previous work was devoted to punctual problems rather than to acquiring a global picture of the properties of the equation .",
    "here , thanks to current computer power , we provide a comprehensive overview of the two - dimensional cgl equation in the large - size limit  @xcite .",
    "we now introduce a few important features of the cgl equation before proceeding to the description of the phase diagram .    early work on cgl has dealt with the problem of the linear stability of its family of plane - wave solutions @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "all these solutions are unstable for @xmath10 ( newell criterion ) , a condition which defines the so - called `` benjamin - feir '' ( bf ) line ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "for @xmath11 , plane - wave solutions with @xmath12 are linearly stable  @xcite .",
    "the instability of the travelling wave solutions above the bf line is readily verified as to be linked to the `` gauge '' invariance of the equation , i.e. its invariance by an arbitrary phase shift ( @xmath13 ) . near the bf line ,",
    "the amplitude modes are strongly damped , `` slaved '' to the marginal phase mode , so that one often speaks of a _ phase instability_. this instability has been conjectured to lead to a disordered regime called _ phase turbulence _",
    "@xcite , in which the field @xmath1 never reaches zero , so that the phase @xmath14 is defined everywhere . near the bf line",
    ", the phase gradient @xmath15 is expected to remain small , and a systematic expansion can be performed , leading to a description of the large - scale dynamics in terms of the phase only .",
    "the behavior of the resulting series of _ phase equations _ obtained by truncation of this expansion is actually not very well known , except for the kuramoto - sivashinsky ( ks ) equation to which these equations reduce infinitely close to the bf line . if phase turbulence ( i.e. spatiotemporal chaos ) has been established for the ks equation , it is the subject of an ongoing controversy away from the bf line , both for the phase equations and for the cgl equation itself  @xcite .",
    "another important feature of the cgl equation is the structure , nature , and role of `` defects '' , i.e. points in space - time where @xmath16 . at such points , the phase is not defined , and it varies by a multiple of @xmath17 when going around them . for space dimensions @xmath18 , defects are topologically constrained",
    "this has been recognized for a long time as one of the salient features of the two - dimensional cgl  @xcite . for @xmath19 , defects are points and can only appear and disappear by pairs . for small enough @xmath2 values , they appear in two different types , `` spirals '' and `` shock - line vertices '' ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the shock - line vertices have mostly been considered as `` passive '' objects which play no important role .",
    "however accurate this statement may be , it remains that the spiral defects have attracted the most attention  @xcite . in spite of all these efforts ,",
    "no exact expression is available ; on the other hand , much is known about the core structure and the `` wings '' , i.e. the emitted outward - going waves .",
    "away from the core , these waves are asymptotic to a planewave with a well - defined wavenumber @xmath20 depending only on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the stability properties of the @xmath21 planewave solution give rise to two important lines in the @xmath22 parameter plane . on the   line ,",

    "this line delimits the region of linear stability of the @xmath21 wave . to its left ,",
    "the wave is linearly unstable ( perturbations grow exponentially in phase space ) ; this is in fact a _ convective _ instability : a _ localized _ perturbation indeed grows , but is advected away from its initial position at the group velocity of the @xmath21 planewave . at this initial position",
    ", the solution relaxes to the planewave . according to aranson et al .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath21 planewave becomes _ absolutely _ unstable to the left of the   line : any initial perturbation grows at its initial location ( in addition to spreading in the direction of the wave ) .     with periodic boundary conditions and parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "we now formulate , at a somewhat conjectural level , the stability properties of the spiral solution and their consequences observable in experiments ( be they numerical or not ) . to the right of line ,",
    "one expects the spiral to resist a ( small ) amount of noise , due to its `` complete '' ( core and wings ) linear stability . between   and",
    ", perturbations are amplified but convected away from the core at the group velocity of the @xmath21 solution .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that the spiral is most sensitive to perturbations in the crossover region between the core and the wings  @xcite . at a given level of ( experimental ) noise ,",
    "perturbations coming from this region are the most dangerous ones .",
    "this convective instability in fact takes the form of growing oscillations of the _ modulus _ @xmath26 as one goes away from the core ( see fig .",
    "experimentally , these oscillations do not saturate , and the wave breaks down , creating more defects .",
    "this mechanism defines a maximum radius @xmath31 which limits the size of observable spirals , and depends on the instability rate and ( weakly ) on the noise level . approaching the limit of absolute instability ( line )",
    ", this diameter goes to zero , and beyond   the spiral is `` completely '' unstable and can not be observed in an experimental ( noisy ) context .",
    "finally , we note that if defects do play an important role in the two - dimensional cgl equation , as we will show below , their topological character is not crucial in determining the dynamical regimes : for @xmath32 , localized `` quasi - defects '' where @xmath26 remains locally very close to zero have been shown to be the key - ingredient in some disordered regimes  @xcite .",
    "but the topological constraint on defects for @xmath18 does provide them with a large domain of existence in parameter space , insuring their relevance in most of the regimes of interest .",

    "a careful analysis of statistical data about phase turbulence in one and two dimensions for various system sizes and integration times is under way and will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of size effects , though , seems to lead to the conclusion that phase turbulence might not exist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it remains nevertheless that for all practical purposes ( numerical or experimental ) , there exists a domain of parameter space where phase turbulence is statistically stationary and subsists even in very large systems for times as long as desired . at any rate , fig .",
    "1 is representative of system sizes and integration times accessible to current computers ( say up to linear size l of the order of @xmath61 and integration times up to @xmath62 ) , and line l is probably slightly shifted for much larger systems .",
    "the status of line t , which delimits the domain of existence of sustained regimes of defect turbulence , is subjected to similar remarks .",
    "statistical data about the probability of breakdown ( to a frozen state ) should be cumulated in order to estimate the position of line t in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this should be completed by a detailed study of the variation of @xmath51 with parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 to provide a precise determination of line t. the question , raised in section  4.1 , of whether lines t and t coalesce in the thermodynamic limit , could thus be addressed .",
    "the existence of defect turbulence is not in question , though , as line t is bound to be situated to the right of line   ( which limits absolutely the domain of existence of frozen states ) .",
    "cellular structures appear both in phase turbulence ( fig .  3 ) and",
    ", of course , as frozen states ( fig .  5 ) . in phase turbulence ,",
    "the dynamics produces statistically stationary configurations which can be studied along the lines of what is usually done for , say , the coarsening of soap froths  @xcite . for example",
    ", a first step would be to estimate the statistical properties of cells their sizes , their number of sides and a second stage could consist in determining the local events of which their dynamical evolution is composed . as mentioned in section  3.2 , this should provide a better understanding of the elementary processes involved in phase turbulence , as well as a better statistical description of this regime .",
    "this could also pave the way to a simple `` particle model '' sharing the same statistical properties , similar to the work of rost and krug  @xcite on the ks equation . in the case of the frozen states ,",
    "as discussed earlier , the characteristics of the structures depend strongly on the `` dynamical history '' that led to them , so that an investigation of their geometrical properties must be correlated to their origin and formation .",
    "admittedly , the phase diagram of fig .",
    "1 is not quite complete .",
    "work remains to be done , in particular on the three following points :    * the @xmath63 , `` nonlinear schrdinger '' , limit needs to be clarified : where are lines   and t located ?",
    "how does the _ core _ instability of spirals intervene in the dynamical regimes ? * the @xmath64 region , and especially the prolongation of line t , should be investigated , as well as the @xmath65 limit .",
    "* it is known that , at least for @xmath32 , the cgl equation exhibits well - behaved disordered regimes in some parts of the @xmath66 half - plane  @xcite , in spite of the absence of the usual nonlinear saturation mechanism .",
    "such a possibility should also be explored in the two - dimensional case . *",
    "the processes of nucleation of the spiral cores should be studied in detail , at least from a statistical point of view . in particular , the minimal core size that can possibly lead to the growth of a spiral should be estimated , as well as the probability of such an event .",
    "this would help define a line to the right of line t beyond which nucleation is immediate ( corresponding to the line `` nuc '' in @xcite ) , as well as clarify the nature of the frozen states with residual turbulence observed experimentally between lines t and t.      the possibility of large - scale descriptions of deterministic spatiotemporal chaos in terms of langevin - like , ( nonlinear ) stochastic equations , is a question currently being debated , essentially because one can then hope to apply methods of statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "one central point is to investigate to what extent and under what conditions the local chaotic fluctuations are equivalent to a `` noise '' at large scales .",
    "the cgl equation offers , here also , a good testground for such questions . in this spirit",
    ", phase turbulence has been proposed  @xcite to be described , at large scales , by the noisy burgers or kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz )  @xcite equation , which is ( among other things ) a model for the kinetic roughening of stochastic interfaces .",
    "indeed , since the phase @xmath14 is always defined in this regime , one can consider the evolution of the phase field only ( at least on an experimental level ) , which , in turn , can be seen as the progression of a @xmath67-dimensional interface in a @xmath68-dimensional medium ( unwinding the phase advance on the real axis ) .",
    "numerical results for @xmath32 and @xmath19 seem to confirm the validity of the kpz ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the kpz picture also reveals the asymptotic behavior of correlations in phase turbulence . in particular , spatial correlations of the phase should decrease either algebraically ( `` linear regime '' of kpz ) or like a stretched exponential ( `` nonlinear regime '' ) .    to go beyond this type of numerical observation",
    ", the effective large - scale stochastic equation has to be built from the original model .",
    "an important step toward this aim has been achieved recently for the one - dimensional kuramoto - sivashinsky equation ( which is also believed to be described by kpz at large scales  @xcite ) . carefully studying the elementary mechanisms at the origin of spatiotemporal chaos , chow and hwa  @xcite",
    "have succeeded in calculating , from data on local chaos only , the parameters of the effective kpz equation .",
    "it is not clear how such a program could be carried out for the cgl equation in any of its disordered regimes even for phase turbulence , but a detailed analysis of the elementary processes at work in each case appears as a necessary step deserving further work .",
    "the general picture of the two - dimensional cgl equation presented here , even though it should be completed along the lines mentioned above , already provides a good starting point to people wanting to study various aspects of spatiotemporal chaos in this system .",
    "in particular , our study should help choose specific parameter values .",
    "it should also help experimentalists recognize whether the physical or numerical problems they study are typical of the cgl equation and , if so , of what particular regime .",
    "finally , natural extensions of this work include a similar study of the three - dimensional case , and of the various modifications of cgl usually considered in the literature .",
