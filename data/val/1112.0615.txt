    "spin dynamics in magnetic nanostructures has been under active study for the past two decades .",
    "a very important issue is the nature of mechanisms that damp the spin motion .",
    "a central question is whether one encounters new processes unique to the nanoscale environment not encountered in bulk matter , where now damping mechanisms are well understood .",
    "the answer to the question just posed is in the affirmative .",
    "an extrinsic mechanism referred to as two magnon scattering is evident in magnetic nanostrutures@xcite . a second intrinsic mechanism , which is the topic of the present paper , is referred to as spin pumping .",
    "for this process to be active the spins of interest must reside in , or be coupled to a metallic structure .",
    "the most commonly studied system wherein spin pumping is observed is an ultrathin ferromagnetic film fabricated from a 3d magnetic metal or alloy that is deposited on a metallic substrate .",
    "precession of the spins within the ferromagnetic film generates a spin current in the substrate that transports transverse angular momentum out of the film , in the direction normal to the interface between the film and the substrate .",
    "a consequence is that the amplitude of the precessional motion within the film decays with time .",
    "a theoretical discussion of the consequences of angular momentum transfer between precessing spins and conduction electrons was presented by slonczewski@xcite , and berger@xcite explored relaxation of precessing moments by the spin pumping process . in an elegant discussion , imnek and",
    "heinrich@xcite derived a correction to the damping term of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation with origin in spin pumping .",
    "a short time later one of the present authors@xcite and imnek@xcite provided expanded discussions of spin pumping through use of the approach used in ref . .",
    "it should be remarked that the theoretical treatments just cited all employ a simple model wherein the precessing moments are described as localized spins , while the band electrons are treated as free electrons in a parabolic band .",
    "these theories thus outline the fundamental physics associated with spin pumping , but their application to real materials is limited .",
    "the phenomenon of spin pumping was discovered experimentally by urban , woltersdorf and heinrich@xcite .    in substrates",
    "wherein the spin diffusion length is very long , the spin current penetrates deeply .",
    "thus , it can enter a second ferromagnetic film placed downstream to excite its spins through the spin torque mechanism@xcite .",
    "one may envision devices made which exploit this phenomenon , most particularly when spins in the primary film are excited by short pulses . in a recent paper , theoretical studies of pulse excitation of a second magnetic moment through spin",
    "current generated by a primary moment have been presented@xcite , in a closely related but somewhat different physical context than ultrathin ferromagnets .",
    "while the theoretical discussions cited above clearly outline the basic physical origin of the spin pumping phenomenon , as noted they employ a very simple model of the band electrons so their application to real materials is limited . within the framework of a semi - classical description of spin motions in an ultrathin film sandwiched between two reservoirs , a description of spin pumping applicable to real materials",
    "has been developed@xcite and calculations that account nicely for data have been presented as well@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one electron theory forms the basis for the discussion .",
    "more recently a full quantum theoretic formulation of spin excitations in ultrathin films in actual experimental geometries has been developed and applied to the analysis of ferromagnetic relaxation under circumstances where the spin pumping mechanism is the dominant contribution to the line width@xcite . here",
    "all features of the problem are described within itinerant electron theory , including the moments whose precession generates the spin current .",
    "the discussion is framed within the language of the kubo formalism of many body theory .",
    "successful accounts of spin pumping data were obtained in parameter free calculations for fe on au(100)@xcite , and also the theory accounts nicely for systematic features in the line width found in fmr studies of a fm / cu / fm trilayer deposited on metallic substrates@xcite .",
    "it is ferromagnetic resonance studies of spin waves in ultrathin films that have motivated our earlier theoretical studies of the spin pumping mechanisms just cited .",
    "we point out that in ultrathin ferromagnets , spin polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy ( speels ) can be used to excite and study large wave vector spin waves@xcite .",
    "the line width of such modes is so very large that they exist only for two or three cycles of oscillation .",
    "the same spin pumping mechanism discussed in the literature on ferromagnetic resonance accounts quantitatively for the line widths found in speels experiments , as discussed in ref . .",
    "it should be noted that none of the theoretical studies described above directly explore the spatial dependence of the spin current generated by the precession of the magnetization ; as we shall see below , the underlying lattice has strong effects on its spatial structure .",
    "the approach in ref .",
    "and ref . led to formulae only for the flux of spin angular momentum that flows out of the ferromagnetic film , and in ref .",
    "it is the response function of the spin system that is calculated , with line width extracted through a procedure very similar to that used by experimentalists when data is analyzed .",
    "the spin current itself is not calculated in this approach .",
    "it is important to develop the means to calculate the spin current directly , at the microscopic level and to explore its spatial variation , including effects of the underlying lattice .",
    "model calculations presented below show these can be striking .",
    "it is noteworthy that temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of pure spin currents have been recently observed by nonlinear optical effects@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a discussion within the framework of the kubo formalism within which such questions can be explored .",
    "the approach may be regarded as extension of the methodology of ref . and",
    "that used in our earlier studies of large wave vector spin waves@xcite . all electrons in the system , including the moments whose precession is responsible for generation of the spin current ,",
    "are described within the framework of itinerant electron theory appropriate to the 3d based magnetic materials .",
    "thus we do not resort to a picture within which the precessing spins that generate the spin current are described phenomenologically .",
    "so in principle , we are not confined to the one electron description of the materials involved , in contrast to the discussions of ref . and ref .",
    "we also present model calculations of the spatial dependence of the spin current in the presence of an underlying lattice , including the influence of a surface on its behavior .",
    "this is done for a simple one - dimensional model within which we can examine general aspects of the influence of the underlying lattice on the spin current .",
    "we remark that our calculations assume that the electrons propagate through the lattice in a ballistic manner , so our results apply to circumstances where the electron mean free path is long .",
    "room temperature measurements@xcite of the indirect exchange coupling between fe films separated by au layers , all deposited by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , show excellent agreement with theory based on ballistic electron propagation out to thirty lattice constants , beyond which the exchange can not be measured . in such high quality",
    "mbe grown samples , at low temperature one may expect ballistic descriptions of electron propagation , both in regard to the indirect exchange coupling discussed in ref . and the spin pumping currents explored here , to extend to very long distances .",
    "we note also quantitative calculations of spin pumping contributions to the linewidth that address real materials , such as those presented in refs .",
    ", employ ballistic descriptions of electron propagation through the lattice .    in our view , interest in direct knowledge of the character of the spin current and its spatial distribution",
    "is stimulated by observations of the inverse spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "if coherent spin motions are excited in an ultrathin film on a metallic substrate , as discussed above , a spin current propagates normal to the interface between the film and the substrate .",
    "the spin current contains a dc component . if spin orbit coupling is present , then a dc charge current parallel to the interface is realized",
    "this produces a hall voltage across the film with magnitude proportional to the square of the amplitude of the spin precession .",
    "the ability to perform explicit calculations of the spin current , and its spatial distribution is the first step in a microscopic theory of the inverse spin hall effect .",
    "we note that descriptions of spin dynamics of nanomagnetic systems within which spin orbit coupling is present have appeared very recently@xcite . in the future it should be possible to combine such discussions with analyses of spin currents such as described here to address the inverse spin hall effect .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ theory ] is devoted to the theoretical formulation of how one generates microscopic descriptions of spin currents within the framework of the kubo formalism .",
    "section [ calculations ] is devoted to presentation of a series of calculations for a model system , and concluding remarks are found in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "it will be useful to provide a bit of orientation regarding the nature of spin currents in metals by recalling the principal results of the analysis found in ref . and ref .",
    "these authors assume the magnetic moments in an ultrathin ferromagnet precess coherently and in phase , so the magnetization is characterized by a rigidly rotating vector .",
    "we write this as @xmath0 with @xmath1 the saturation magnetization and @xmath2 a unit vector@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref . then show that the spin current radiated into the two semi infinite substrates which surround a ferromagnetic film has the form @xmath3\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{4\\pi m_s^2}\\left[a_r\\vec{m}(t)\\times\\frac{d\\vec{m}(t)}{dt}-a_im_s\\frac{d\\vec{m}(t)}{dt}\\right ] \\ , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath4 .",

    "then in response to the field , we shall have @xmath8 , where in the linear response regime @xmath9 oscillates with frequency @xmath7 .",
    "we then have two components to the spin current .",

    "this is @xmath11 where the angular brackets denote a time average .",

    "notice , incidentally , that an ac hall voltage also is necessarily present .    in our analysis , within the framework of the kubo formalism",

    "our approach yields the ac component that , in the formalism of ref .",

    "[ ipumpac ] .",
    "however , when an external driving field is applied to the moment or moments responsible for generating the spin current , we calculate @xmath12 directly without the need to resort to explicit descriptions of the one electron eigenstates of the system , and we calculate @xmath9 as well within the same theoretical structure . thus , if desired we may extract the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 by comparison of our results with eq .",
    "[ ipumpac ] , which shows the polarization of the ac spin current is perpendicular to the static magnetization .",

    "spin current streams both to the right and the left , and symmetry requires the amplitude of each stream to be the same .",
    "however , as argued some time ago in a phenomenological discussion presented by valet and fert@xcite , the spin current must vanish at the surface .",
    "if the surface is located at @xmath110 , then between our impurity and the surface , or in a system with a film radiating spin current into a substrate of finite thickness , in valet - fert theory the spatial profile of the spin current will have the form @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the spin diffusion length . in our model ,",
    "the spin diffusion length is infinite , so within the phenomenological theory the spin current should have a linear variation , proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "an alternative explanation for the linear variation of the spin current is the following : at an arbitrary position @xmath26 between the magnetic impurity and the surface , the total spin current @xmath114 is given by the difference between the current @xmath115 flowing toward @xmath116 and the current @xmath117 flowing toward the impurity located at @xmath118 . both @xmath115 and @xmath117 are proportional to the direction of the transverse component of the electron spin at @xmath26 , which is given by @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the time the perturbation takes to reach @xmath26 . since the spin disturbance propagates with the electronic fermi velocity , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for relatively small frequencies ,",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath123 .    in fig .",
    "[ figure_4 ] , we show results of the spin current generated by a precessing moment in a semi - infinite line of sites , calculated on resonance .",
    "the surface is located at site @xmath124 , and the precessing impurity is located at site @xmath125 .",
    "we see that to the right of the precessing moment , the spin current settles down to a constant value as angular momentum is carried off into the bulk of the material .",
    "however , on the left side , in the region between the moment and the surface , our microscopic calculation produces a linear decrease of the spin current in excellent agreement with the phenomenology set forth in ref . .",
    "the surface influences the spatial variation in the spin current even when the precessing moment is very far from the surface .",
    "of course , in a real material with finite spin diffusion length @xmath112 the moment will not feel the presence of the surface when the distance between it and the surface is long compared to @xmath112 . in high purity materials such as the noble metals",
    ", the spin diffusion length can be quite long , it should be noted .",
    "one can grow ultrathin 3d ferromagnets on semiconducting substrates such as gaas .",
    "it would be of great interest to cap such films with a noble metal such as ag ( indeed this is often done to prevent oxidation of the ferromagnet ) and then study the dependence of the spin pumping relaxation rate as a function of thickness of the capping layer .    from fig .",
    "[ figure_4 ] , in our model with its infinite spin diffusion length , it is clear that the presence of the surface strongly influences the nature of the spin current radiated from the precessing impurity .",
    "one can then inquire how , as the impurity is moved farther and farther from the surface , one approaches the spin pumping line width realized in the bulk of the material .",
    "this can be studied by generating the response function associated with the impurity moment itself . in principle",
    ", one can measure the width of the calculated resonant structure as a function of distance of the moment from the surface , to see how the line width approaches the bulk value .",
    "we have studied this issue , to find that the approach to the bulk limit is not simple , for the following reason .",
    "when the impurity is at any given position @xmath24 , the region between site @xmath24 and the surface at @xmath124 acts as a quantum well of finite depth , by virtue of the fact that an electron reflected from the surface is backscattered by the one electron potential associated with the impurity site .",
    "there are then resonant levels for electrons in this region , and these produce dramatic structures in the resonance lineshape . under these circumstances , it is difficult to define the line width .",
    "we illustrate such structures in fig .",
    "[ figure_5 ] , where we plot the frequency variation of the spin current in the region between the impurity and the surface ( solid line ) and also the frequency variation of the spin current radiated into the bulk ( dashed line ) , both calculated across the bond between the magnetic impurity and its nearest neighbors .",
    "similar structures are found in the lineshape of the impurity response as well . as the impurity is moved farther and farther from the surface",
    ", these subsidiary peaks move inward to merge with the main structure in the resonant response .",
    "it is thus not clear how one can extract something that can be called a line width when the profile of the response function is so complex .",
    "it is the case that our calculation produces a bulk like response very far indeed from the surface , if one blurs out the fine structure produced by the resonant states .",
    "the spatial variation of the spin current in the region between the impurity and the surface is most striking , for excitation frequencies in the vicinity of the subsidiary resonances illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure_5 ] .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ figure_6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ figure_6](a ) , we see that the spatial variation is controlled by a single resonance level ( `` virtual level '' ) in the region between the impurity and the surface , and the same is true in fig . [ figure_6](b ) . a proper quantum theory is required for such features to appear .",
    "they are absent from the macroscopic approach described by valet and fert@xcite , for example .",
    "it will be of great interest to see if such features will be present in a full multiband description of spin pumping relaxation in capped ultrathin films .",
    "if the magnetization in such a film is excited by a microwave field , all spins in a given plane parallel to the surface and interface will precess in phase .",
    "the physical situation is thus similar to that in the one dimensional model explored in the present paper .",
    "we shall explore the question of resonant structures in the relaxation rate for realisitic three dimensional electronic structures in the near future .",
    "it is our view that the features described in the discussion above , while illustrated through use of our one dimensional model , are general phenomena that will be present in full three dimensional calculations directed toward ferromagnetic resonance excitation of coherent , spatially uniform spin motions in an ultrathin film on a substrate or such a film with a metallic capping layer .",
    "we note that the existence of quantum well states have been directly observed in magnetic multilayers by inverse angle - resolved photoemission@xcite .",
    "we now turn to effects specific to our one dimensional model .",
    "an example of a physical system wherein these considerations will be relevant is magnetic moments on carbon nanotubes , as discussed in ref . .",
    "there is an even / odd effect in the spatial distribution of spin current , in the presence of a surface . in fig .",
    "[ figure_4 ] , with the surface site @xmath124 , we have illustrated the spatial distribution of spin current for an impurity @xmath126 sites removed from the surface , at @xmath125 . in fig .",
    "[ figure_7 ] , we show what happens when the impurity is moved one lattice site closer to the surface , @xmath127 . in both figures , the impurity is excited at resonance and the calculations assume the band is precisely half filled .",
    "we see in both figures that the spin current vanishes at the surface , as the boundary condition in ref .",
    "however , when the impurity is on a site where @xmath24 is even , there is a discontinuity in the spin current at the impurity itself .",
    "this is a quantum effect ; the period of oscillations @xmath128 for a half filled band is two lattice constants , so movement of the impurity one lattice constant leads to a phase change of 180 degrees for any disturbance it samples from electrons at or very close to the fermi surface .",
    "the spin current near the impurity on the left side of the figure is a coherent superposition of that radiated by the impurity and directed toward the surface , and that reflected back off the surface .",
    "there are quantum interference effects associated with these two counter propagating currents , so movement of the impurity by a single lattice constant affects the total spin current samples by it by a large amount .",
    "we remind the reader that our calculations are all in the limit where ballistic transport is envisioned .",
    "such interference effects will be absent in a system wherein the electron mean free path is shorter than the distance between the impurity and the surface .",
    "in this paper we have developed a formalism that allows the calculation of the spatial dependence of the spin current generated by precessing magnetic moments embedded within or in contact with conducting materials .",
    "the discussion is carried out entirely within an itinerant electron description appropriate to metallic 3d ferromagnets .",
    "the magnetic moments whose precession generate the spin current are formed through action of on site , intra atomic coulomb interactions of hubbard character as opposed to the localized spin models used in other approaches . in this paper , in the interest of simplicity we have presented the formalism framed in language suitable to a one dimensional system .",
    "the extension to a three dimensional system described by the empirical tight binding model we have used in earlier studies@xcite is very straightforward .",
    "we have calculations underway directed toward real materials .",
    "we have also presented a series of numerical calculations of the spatial variation of the spin current generated by a single precessing magnetic moment embedded in a one dimensional lattice of sites , infinite or semi - infinite in length . for the case where the moment is embedded in an infinite line of sites",
    ", we find striking spatial variations of the spin current at microscopic length scales that have their origin in the fermi wavelength of the electrons at the fermi surface , and its relationship to the underlying lattice constant .",
    "these oscillations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] , are a dynamic analogue of the phenomenon of aliasing that enters the description of the static rkky interaction between ferromagnetic films separated by a metallic film@xcite .",
    "we can expect such features to be present also in three dimensional calculations , it should be remarked .",
    "for instance , if one considers an ultrathin ferromagnetic film on a metallic substrate excited in ferromagnetic resonance , in each layer of the ferromagnet the spins precess in phase . in this circumstance , each layer may be viewed as a giant spin embedded in a one dimensional lattice .",
    "the spin current in the substrate will also vary only in the direction perpendicular to the interface , and it will be constant throughout a given plane .",
    "there is thus an analogy between this circumstance and the one dimensional model system explored in the present paper .",
    "we have also presented studies of the influence of a surface on the spatial distribution of spin current .",
    "our microscopic model produces results in excellent accord with the phenomenological discussion of valet and fert@xcite .",
    "the even / odd effect discussed near the end of section [ calculations ] is fascinating to us .",
    "while this is specific to one dimensional systems , it is our view that in carbon nanotubes wherein the spin diffusion length is very long , the considerations in our discussion are relevant to the description of the relaxation rate of a localized moment incorporated into such a structure .",
