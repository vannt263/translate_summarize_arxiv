    "the study of thermoelectric effects in nanostructures  @xcite is attracting increasing interest .",
    "heat - to - work conversion based on thermoelectricity promises an enhanced efficiency as a consequence of the reduction of the phonon contribution to thermal conductance in disordered nanostructures  @xcite and of the `` energy filtering '' effect that can result from confinement and quantum effects @xcite .",
    "in particular , an increase of the electron contribution to the figure of merit @xmath1 ( which controls the maximum efficiency and the efficiency at maximum power ) is possible if one can `` filter '' the electrons participating in the transport to a narrow energy range  @xcite .    a heat engine composed of a quantum dot ( qd ) is a paradigmatic example , since it is characterized by a spectrum of discrete levels which maximizes energy filtering .",
    "the thermoelectric properties of qd systems  @xcite and the performance of qd - based heat engines  @xcite has been studied theoretically by a number of authors ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "the vast majority of the papers dealing with qd - based heat engines consider a single degenerate energy level or two non - degenerate levels  @xcite .",
    "the case of qds with many levels has been addressed only in few papers  @xcite . moreover , the performance of qd - based heat engine has been mostly studied within the linear response regime  @xcite , where the thermoelectric performance of the system is entirely characterized by @xmath1 .",
    "the case of an interacting multi - level qd beyond the linear response has not been addressed so far . on the one hand",
    ", the presence of many levels is expected to yield important consequences .",
    "indeed , already in the linear - response regime they have an impact on the thermopower , the thermal conductance and @xmath1  @xcite . on the other ,",
    "non - linear effects , relevant when larger temperature and voltage biases are applied , are important as far as power and efficiency are concerned .",
    "we emphasize that a number of experiments assessing the thermoelectric properties of qds have been reported in refs .  .",
    "in this paper we fill this gap by studying the thermoelectric properties and heat - to - work conversion performance of a multi - level qd in a multi - terminal configuration within the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "we consider the limit of small tunnelling rates ( sequential tunnelling regime ) and we study both the linear and non - linear response regimes .",
    "coulomb interaction among electrons is accounted for by a finite and small capacitance @xmath2 whose associated energy scale is its charging energy @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of electrons in the qd and @xmath5 is the electron charge .",
    "moreover , we consider a generic multi - terminal structure , whereby the qd is connected to many ( two or more ) reservoirs .",
    "we will concentrate only on the optimization of the thermoelectric properties of the electronic system , neglecting the parasitic phononic contribution to heat transport .",
    "our results therefore set an upper bound to the thermoelectric efficiency of the qd , approachable only in the limit in which suitable strategies to strongly reduce phonon transport are implemented .",
    "generalizing refs .   and to the multi - terminal case , by solving a set of kinetic equations one can determine the probability of occupation of the energy levels of the qd in a multi - terminal setup , thus allowing to calculate the charge and heat currents for given values of the electrochemical potentials and temperatures of the reservoirs .",
    "in the linear response regime , where voltage and temperature biases are small , we derive closed - form expressions for the charge and heat currents and specify their limits of validity .",
    "we define local and non - local transport coefficients and express them in terms of a generating function under the assumption that the tunneling rates are energy - independent .",
    "we then derive , in the low temperature limit , analytical expressions for all transport coefficients as a function of the electrochemical potential @xmath6 . along with the main features of the transport coefficients ( located around values of @xmath6 equal to the dominant transition energies required to add or remove an electron from the qd ) ,",
    "such expressions also describe a fine structure arising from the interplay between interaction and level quantization ( controlled by the two energy scales : charging energy and level spacing ) .",
    "furthermore , for the calculation of the thermal conductance we find that it is crucial to consider the presence of many levels . within the linear response",
    ", we consider both the two - terminal and the three - terminal system aiming at addressing the performance of heat - to - work conversion . in the former case",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for the power factor @xmath0 and the figure of merit @xmath1 finding , remarkably , that those quantities are simultaneously maximized for values of the electrochemical potential which differ by about @xmath7 with respect to the dominant transition energies .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 shows a fine structure of secondary peaks whose height is independent of the system s parameters and can take values as large as @xmath8 .",
    "we compare the figure of merit with a non - interacting system , finding that coulomb interactions dramatically increase @xmath1 by strongly suppressing the thermal conductance . for the case of three terminals with energy - independent tunneling rates ,",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the maximum power and corresponding efficiency , finding that the addition of a third terminal at an intermediate temperature decreases the efficiency at maximum power , but can increase the power . we also find particular intermediate temperatures where the third terminal increases the maximum power and achieves the same efficiency of a two terminal system .",
    "we analyze the regime beyond the linear response by numerically solving the kinetic equations , focusing on the two - terminal setup .",
    "going beyond the linear response , i.e. considering large temperature and voltage biases , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is interesting for various reasons . on one hand , it allows to increase the carnot efficiency @xmath11 and the power generated by a heat engine ( in our case the peak power scales approximately as @xmath12 also beyond the linear response regime ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the efficiency at maximum power is not bounded by @xmath13 , as in the linear response , and can even go above the curzon - alhborn efficiency  @xcite . in literature",
    ", the scattering theory of nonlinear thermoelectric transport in quantum conductors has been developed only recently @xcite .",
    "the regime beyond linear response for qd - based heat engines has been theoretically addressed in refs .  , but",
    "limited to single or double level quantum dots .    in discussing the results , we first focus on the behavior of the non - linear seebeck and peltier coefficients aiming at assessing the interplay between charging energy and level spacing on these two quantities and how the onsager reciprocity relation that connects them is violated beyond linear response .",
    "second , we study the efficiency and output power of a heat engine . in particular , we calculate the maximum efficiency and maximum power by maximizing such quantities with respect to the applied bias voltage , for fixed values of temperature bias and electrochemical potential .",
    "the maximum efficiency shows only quantitative changes , with respect to the linear response , by increasing the temperature bias .",
    "the efficiency at maximum power instead develops peaks which go beyond the @xmath13 linear - response limit and approach @xmath11 for large temperature differences .",
    "remarkably , the maximum power , normalized to its peak value , only slightly depends on the temperature bias and can be well approximated by the analytic expression obtained for the linear response regime .",
    "moreover , we find that efficiency at maximum power and maximum power take approximately their peak values simultaneously , under the same conditions found for the linear response .",
    "finally , we assess the impact of interactions by comparing the efficiency at maximum power in two situations , namely the case of a doubly degenerate level with interaction and the case of two non - degenerate levels without interaction .",
    "we find that , especially when charging energy and level spacing are of the order of the thermal energy , the efficiency at maximum power is much higher in the interacting case and goes above the curzon - alhborn efficiency .",
    "we also find that in the doubly degenerate interacting case the maximum power is enhanced by almost a factor 2 with respect to the non - degenerate case .",
