    "graphene inherits interesting properties from its linear dispersion for low - energy quasi - particle excitations  @xcite , making it a candidate for future spintronics applications  @xcite .",
    "part of its functionality comes from the ability to tune the carrier density and carrier type ( electron or hole ) with electric gates , which allows for the straightforward creation of n - p junctions in graphene .",
    "such junctions allow the investigation of the dynamics of the effective massless dirac - fermions in graphene , showing interesting properties such as klein tunneling  @xcite , or beam collimation and lensing  @xcite .",

    "when the potential step height @xmath0 is such that the fermi energy in both regions lies inside the spin - orbit induced band gap @xmath1 , perfect transmission is trivially expected since transport in both regions occurs in the form of topological edge channels .",
    "spin - preserving backscattering processes then amount to crossing the sample width and are forbidden as long as the ribbon s width is larger than the width of the edge states  @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath0 is bigger than @xmath1 , a qsh insulator / metal junction is formed and topological edge channels in one region evolve into multiple bulk channels above the bandgap in the other ( see fig .  [ fig : system ] ) .",
    "backscattering of the qsh edge states could then in principle occur through the metallic region where a path opens up allowing the carriers to cross the sample s width from one boundary to the other .",
    "this reflection process would lead to a spin - current parallel to the interface ( a similar spin - current has been predicted at an interface between semi - infinite graphene planes in the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we show in this paper that the topological edge states in a clean ribbon of an arbitrary crystallographic orientation can not be reflected at a qsh insulator / metal junction ( either n - n or p - p ) due to the orthogonality of left- and right - moving edge states at opposite boundaries .",
    "a similar mechanism was recently shown to be responsible for the perfect transmission of the zero landau level edge state at a magnetic flux step in folded graphene nanoribbons  @xcite .",

    "for an armchair ribbon , this width only depends on the magnitude of the spin - orbit induced gap , whereas it is practically independent of this parameter for zigzag ribbons where the edge state width becomes energy - dependent instead .",

    "backscattering is also present for intrinsic sources of intervalley scattering , like a ( clean ) n - p junction in a zigzag ribbon  @xcite .",
    "however , we find that in any case perfect transmission is restored upon increasing the ribbon s width @xmath3 , essentially because the probability of forward scattering increases with the ribbon s width while the only available backscattering channel remains one . the conductance recovery with increasing @xmath3 depends on the ribbon termination due to the different edge state character for different ribbon boundaries . a summary of all our results and some concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "these are propagating in the @xmath44-direction and exponentially decaying in the @xmath54-direction .",
    "@xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is a two - component spinor for the k ( k ) valley which contains the relative amplitude of the wavefunction on the @xmath10 and @xmath11 sublattices . in the appendix",
    "we show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ac_wavefunction ] ) satisfies the armchair boundary condition when @xmath57 where @xmath58 for spin - up ( spin - down ) and @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the signs of the particle s wave vector and energy , while @xmath61 is the spin - orbit induced gap for a wide ribbon .",
    "the dispersion of these states is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the fermi velocity .",
    "as @xmath64 needs to be positive for a bounded solution , positive energy states ( electron - like ) either propagate with positive wavevector [ @xmath65 and spin - down ( @xmath66 ) , or negative wavevector [ @xmath67 and spin - up ( @xmath68 ) along the left boundary . for the right boundary we use the same ansatz  ( [ eq : ac_wavefunction ] ) but now the ribbon extends to values @xmath69 and the boundary condition is met at @xmath46 .",
    "now @xmath64 needs to be negative and the positive energy edge state has positive ( negative ) wavevector with spin - up ( down ) . if we rotate our lattice by 90 degrees , we get the electronic edge states propagating along the sample s boundaries as sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] .",
    "the width of the edge states is given by the parameter @xmath70 , and is thus determined solely by the spin - orbit coupling strength . in our numerical calculations",

    "[ fig : chargedensity ] .",
    "the orthogonality between forward- and backscattered edge states can be understood as follows . in the appendix",

    "one can see that the isospins of counterpropagating equal - spin edge states ( moving at opposite boundaries ) are orthogonal when the armchair ribbon is metallic , i.e. , for @xmath81 , with @xmath82 . scattering between these states is thus forbidden which leads to the absence of reflection .    the case of semiconducting armchair ribbons",
    "is a bit more involved .",

    "however , the semiconducting armchair ribbon is insulating for small energies in the right region , and the transmission is zero for such energies .",
    "therefore , knowledge of the wavefunction in the left region only is not sufficient in order to make a statement for the transmission in semiconducting armchair ribbons . in our case of a constant spin - orbit coupling and a potential step",
    "we can only state that numerically we also observe perfect transmission as long as the ribbon is metallic in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , i.e. , @xmath83 , even though the isospins of the incoming and outgoing edge states are not orthogonal .",
    "now we consider a wide zigzag ribbon that extends along the horizontal @xmath54-direction , so that the boundaries are at @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( see fig .",

    "the dispersive topological edge states are centered around the @xmath86 point ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "[ fig : chargedensity - roughness ] . in the presence of edge roughness",
    ", the spin - polarized edge state incoming from the upper boundary does not follow a straight line anymore ( like in the flakes of fig .",
    "[ fig : chargedensity ] ) but its wavefuction accommodates to the roughened boundary",
    ". therefore , unless @xmath97 is so large that upper and lower topological edge state wavefunctions can overlap , there are still no available intra - boundary backscattering channels .",
    "only a single reflection channel is open , namely to cross to the topological edge state at the lower boundary .",
    "this is radically different in a ribbon without intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , where multiple transmission and reflection channels are available throughout the bulk and disorder will have a bigger impact .",
    "the previous argument explains the small sensitivity of the conductance on roughness depth @xmath97 for energies below the spin - orbit induced gap in figs .",
    "[ fig : troughness - armchair ] and [ fig : troughness - zigzag ] .",
    "however , when the edge state width @xmath39 becomes comparable to the ribbon s effective width ( given approximately by @xmath122 ) , direct inter - boundary backscattering can take place in the left region due to the overlap of counter - propagating ( non - orthogonal ) edge channels , significantly reducing the transmission probability .",
    "this happens for zigzag ribbons with energies close to the band - gap edge , where the edge state width diverges ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : decaylength ] ) , which manifests itself as a conductance dip in fig .",

    "this can be understood by realizing that , as the ribbon width is increased , the number of available forward scattering channels grows while the available backscattering channels remains one .",
    "note that for the potential step parameters selected , all curves behave similarly except for the one of the zigzag terminated ribbon for energies close to the gap .",
    "the slower conductance increase in that case is a result of the large overlap of the opposite boundary topological edge states , as discussed previously .",
    "although the junction used for the calculations in fig .",

    "this has been explained by proving the isospin orthogonality between forward and backward edge channels analytically , a mechanism that is analog to the klein tunneling .",
    "we have also found that the edge state width only depends on the spin - orbit coupling strength for armchair ribbons but is in addition strongly energy dependent for zigzag ribbons . in the presence of edge roughness , the orthogonality , and thereby the perfect transmission ,",
    "is destroyed and the upper ( lower ) edge channel can be reflected to the lower ( upper ) one through the metallic region where the particle s wave function spans the whole ribbon s width .",
    "however , even in the presence of strong disorder , reflection from a qsh insulator / metal junction is small as compared to a similar ribbon in the absence of intrinsic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this protection can be understood as a spin - orbit proximity effect  @xcite since to the left of the junction the edge states are still topologically protected ( as long as time - reversal symmetry breaking disorder is absent ) .",
    "finally , we found that perfect transmission is gradually restored in the presence of disorder as the ribbon s width increases , since the number of available forward - scattering channels grows .",
    "this recovery is dependent on the ribbon s crystallographic orientation , and was explained by analytical considerations as well as by numerical simulations of the charge density across the junction . in the present work , the qsh insulator / metal junction was realized by means of a constant spin - orbit coupling and an electrostatic potential step .",
