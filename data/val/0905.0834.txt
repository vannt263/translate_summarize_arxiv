    "the rich @xmath8 carinae complex contains many unstudied open clusters , as well as a number of cepheid variables of potential value as calibrators for the extragalactic distance scale . previous",
    "_ surveys of the region for cepheid / association coincidences by @xcite and @xcite were not very successful at discovering potential new calibrators , nor was a more detailed study by @xcite of the unstudied cluster ruprecht 91 with its nearby cepheids sx and vy carinae .",
    "there are many cepheids lying in the region , however , and it is important to examine all potential coincidences with unstudied open clusters to establish whether or not they may constitute physical pairs .",
    "collinder 236 ( c1055607 ) is an unstudied , sparsely - populated , open cluster lying southeast of the @xmath8 carinae nebula complex .",
    "it was noted previously by @xcite to contain the long - period cepheid wz carinae ( hd 94777 , @xmath9 ) within its coronal region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the cepheid is roughly 1.5 to 2 magnitudes brighter than the brightest cluster stars , which , in combination with its spatial location , provides sufficient grounds to suspect it may be an outlying cluster member .",
    "this paper uses photometric data and star counts for collinder 236 to examine the likelihood of cluster membership for wz car , and to explore its properties .",
    "galactic star clusters that host cepheid variables are of more than passing interest , given that they provide a means of calibrating intrinsic colours and luminosities for cepheids through photometric dereddening procedures and zero - age main sequence ( zams ) fitting .",
    "recent studies by @xcite and @xcite have helped to establish the zero - point of the cepheid period - luminosity relation through hst and hipparcos parallaxes , while other calibration techniques have been applied to the problem by @xcite .",
    "there have also been new , deep studies of several recognized cepheid calibrating clusters by @xcite and @xcite using ccd _",
    "ubvk _ and _ bvi@xmath10jhk@xmath11 _ photometry , respectively .",
    "such studies are important for extending the calibration sample to long period cepheids in clusters and associations , although the addition of short - period calibrators is also important , as indicated by the case of cg cas as a member of berkeley 58 @xcite .",
    "as will be argued elsewhere @xcite , the open cluster calibration of the cepheid period - luminosity relation is on fairly solid ground when proper consideration is made for potential problems arising from tie - ins to standard photometric systems , the data reduction techniques employed , the manner in which cluster main - sequence fitting is used to deduce distances , and how interstellar reddening and differential reddening are treated .",

    "portions of the present study were supported by research funding awarded through the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) , through the small research grants program of the american astronomical society , through the russian foundation for basic research ( rfbr ) , and through the program of support for leading scientific schools of russia .",
    "we are grateful to the director of harvard college observatory for access to the plate stacks , robert garrison for the allocation of observing time at utso , and michelle chouinard ferguson for software development .",
