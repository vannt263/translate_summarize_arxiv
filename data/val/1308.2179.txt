    "thermoelectric devices use a coupling between heat and particle currents driven by local gradients in temperature and chemical potential to generate electrical power or for cooling @xcite .",
    "since they work without any moving parts , such machines have a lot of advantages compared to their cyclic counterparts , which rely on the periodic compression and expansion of a certain working fluid @xcite .",
    "however , so far their notoriously modest efficiency prevents a wide - ranging applicability . although it has been shown that proper energy filtering leads to highly efficient thermoelectric heat engines @xcite , which , in principle , may even reach carnot efficiency @xcite , so far no competitive devices coming even close to this limit are available .",
    "consequently , the challenge of finding better thermoelectric materials has attracted a great amount of scientific interest during the last decades .",
    "+ recently , benenti discovered a new option to enhance the performance of thermoelectric engines @xcite .",
    "their rather general analysis within the phenomenological framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics reveals that a magnetic field , which breaks time reversal symmetry , could enhance thermoelectric efficiency significantly . in principle",
    ", it even seems to be possible to get completely reversible transport , i.e. , devices that work at carnot efficiency while delivering finite power output .",
    "this spectacular observation prompts the question , whether this option can be realized in specific microscopic models .",
    "+ an elementary and well established framework for the description of thermoelectric transport on a microscopic level is provided by the scattering approach originally pioneered by landauer @xcite . the basic idea behind",
    "this method is to connect two electronic reservoirs ( terminals ) of different temperature and chemical potential via perfect , infinitely long leads to a central scattering region . by assuming non interacting electrons , which are transferred coherently between the terminals , it is possible to express the linear transport coefficients in terms of the scattering matrix that describes the motion of a single electron of energy @xmath0 through the central region .",
    "thus , the macroscopic transport process can be traced back to the microscopic dynamics of the electrons .",
    "this formalism can easily be extended to an arbitrary number of terminals @xcite .",
    "+ within a purely coherent two - terminal set - up , current conservation requires a symmetric scattering matrix and hence a symmetric matrix of kinetic coefficients , even in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "therefore , without inelastic scattering events the broken time reversal symmetry is not visible on the macroscopic scale .",
    "an elegant way to simulate inelastic scattering within an inherently conservative system goes back to bttiker @xcite .",
    "he proposed to attach additional , so - called probe terminals to the scattering region , whose temperature and chemical potential are adjusted in such a way that they do not exchange any net quantities with the remaining terminals but only induce phase - breaking .",
    "+ the arguably most simple case is to include only one probe terminal , which leads to a three - terminal model .",
    "saito @xcite pointed out that such a minimal set - up is sufficient to obtain a non - symmetric matrix of kinetic coefficients .",
    "however , we have shown in a preceding work on the three - terminal system @xcite that current conservation puts a much stronger bound on the onsager coefficients than the bare second law .",
    "it turned out that this new bound constrains the maximum efficiency of the model as a thermoelectric heat engine to be significantly smaller than the carnot value as soon as the onsager matrix becomes non - symmetric .",
    "moreover , balachandran @xcite demonstrated by extensive numerical efforts that our bound is tight .",
    "+ the strong bounds on onsager coefficients and efficiency obtained within the three - terminal set - up raise the question whether they persist if more terminals are included .",
    "this problem will be addressed in this paper .",
    "we will derive a universal bound on kinetic coefficients that depends only on the number of terminals and gets weaker as this number increases . only in the limit of infinitely many terminals ,",
    "this bound approaches the well - known one following from the positivity of entropy production . by specializing these results to thermoelectric transport between two _ real _ terminals with the other @xmath1 acting as probe terminals , we obtain bounds on the efficiency and the efficiency at maximum power for different variants of thermoelectric devices like heat engines and cooling devices .",
    "+ our results follow from analyzing the matrix of kinetic coefficients in the @xmath2-terminal set - up and its subsequent specializations to two real and @xmath1 probe terminals . on a technical level",
    ", we introduce an asymmetry index for a positive semi - definite matrix and compute it for the class of matrices characteristic for the scattering approach .",
    "these calculations involve a fair amount of original matrix algebra for doubly substochastic matrices and their schur complements , which we develop in an extended and self - contained mathematical appendix .",
    "+ the main part of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the multi - terminal model and recall the expressions for its kinetic coefficients . in section 3 , we derive the new bounds on these coefficients . in section 4 ,",
    "we show how these bounds imply bounds on the efficiency and the efficiency at maximum power for heat engines , for refrigerators , for iso - thermal engines and for absorption refrigerators .",
    "in contrast to the former two classes , the latter two involve only one type of affinities , namely chemical potential or temperature differences , respectively , which implies even stronger bounds .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we consider the set - up schematically shown in figure [ fig_multi_terminal_model ] .",
    "a central scattering region equipped with a constant magnetic field @xmath3 is connected to @xmath2 independent electronic reservoirs ( terminals ) of respective temperature @xmath4 and chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "we assume non interacting electrons , which are transferred coherently between the terminals without any inelastic scattering . in order to describe the resulting transport process within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics",
    ", we fix the reference temperature @xmath6 and chemical potential @xmath7 , and define the affinities @xmath8 by @xmath9 and @xmath10 we denote the charge and the heat current flowing out of the reservoir @xmath11 , respectively . within the linear response regime ,",
    "which is valid as long as the temperature and chemical potential differences @xmath12 and @xmath13 are small compared to the respective reference values , the currents and affinities are connected via the phenomenological equations @xcite @xmath14 here , we introduced the current vector @xmath15 with the respective subunits @xmath16 analogously , we divide the matrix of kinetic coefficients @xmath17 into the @xmath18 blocks @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , which can be calculated explicitly . by making use of the multi - terminal landauer formula @xcite",
    ", we get the expression @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes planck s constant , @xmath23 the electronic unit charge , @xmath24^{-1}\\ ] ] the negative derivative of the fermi function and @xmath25 boltzmann s constant .",
    "+ the expression ( [ landauer buttiker ] ) shows that the transport properties of the model are completely determined by the transition probabilities @xmath26 , which obey two important relations .",
    "first , current conservation requires the sum rule @xmath27 i.e. , the transition matrix @xmath28 is doubly stochastic for any @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "second , due to time reversal symmetry , the @xmath31 have to posses the symmetry @xmath32 notably , for a fixed magnetic field @xmath3 , the transition matrix @xmath33 does not necessarily have to be symmetric .",
    "this observation will be crucial for the subsequent considerations .",
    "+ for later purpose , we note that , by combining ( [ onsager matrix ] ) and ( [ landauer buttiker ] ) , @xmath34 can be expressed as an integral over tensor products given by @xmath35 here , @xmath36 denotes the identity matrix and @xmath37 arises from @xmath33 by deleting the first row and column .",
    "consequently , the matrix @xmath38 must be _ doubly substochastic _ , which means that all entries of @xmath39 are non - negative and any row and column sums up to a value _ not greater _",
    "than @xmath40 .",
    "the phenomenological framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics provides two fundamental constraints on the matrix of kinetic coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "first , since the entropy production accompanying the transport process descibed by ( [ phenomenological equations ] ) reads @xcite @xmath41 the second law requires @xmath34 to be positive semi - definite .",
    "second , onsager s reciprocal relations impose the symmetry @xmath42 apart from these constraints , no further general relations restricting the elements of @xmath34 at fixed magnetic field @xmath3 are known .",
    "we will now demonstrate that such a lack of constraints leads to profound consequences for the thermodynamical properties of this model . to this end",
    ", we split the current vector @xmath43 into an irreversible and a reversible part given by @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the reversible part vanishes for @xmath45 by virtue of the reciprocal relations ( [ time reversal symmetry for l ] ) .",
    "however , in situations with @xmath46 it can become arbitrarily large without contributing to the entropy production ( [ entropy production ] ) . in principle",
    ", it would be even possible to have @xmath47 and @xmath48 simultaneously , i.e. , completely reversible transport , suggesting _",
    "inter alia _ the opportunity for a thermoelectric heat engine operating at carnot efficiency with finite power output @xcite .",
    "this observation raises the question , whether there might be stronger relations between the kinetic coefficients going beyond the well known reciprocal relations ( [ time reversal symmetry for l ] ) . in the next section , starting from the microscopic representation ( [ landauer buttiker ] ) , we derive bounds on the kinetic coefficients , which prevent this option of carnot efficiency with finite power .",
    "these bounds can be derived by first quantifying the asymmetry of the onsager matrix @xmath34 . for an arbitrary positive semi - definite matrix @xmath49",
    "we define an asymmetry index by @xmath50 some of the basic properties of this asymmetry index are outlined in [ apx ai basic properties ] .",
    "we note that a quite similar quantity was introduced by crouzeix and gutan @xcite in another context .",
    "+ we will now proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we show that the asymmetry index of the matrix of kinetic coefficients @xmath34 and all its principal submatrices is bounded from above for any finite number of terminals @xmath2 .",
    "second , we will derive therefrom a set of new bounds on the elements of @xmath34 , which go beyond the second law .",
    "we note that from now on we notationally suppress the dependence of any quantity on the magnetic field in order to keep the notation slim .",
    "+ for the first step , we define the quadratic form @xmath51 for any @xmath52 and any @xmath53 . here , @xmath54 denotes a set of @xmath55 integers .",
    "the matrix @xmath56 arises from @xmath57 by taking all blocks @xmath58 with column and row index in @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 is a principal submatrix of @xmath57 , which preserves the @xmath18 block structure shown in ( [ onsager matrix ] ) .",
    "comparing ( [ asymmetry form ] ) with the definition ( [ asymmetry index ] ) reveals that the minimum @xmath61 for which @xmath62 is positive semi - definite equals the asymmetry index of @xmath56 .",
    "next , by recalling ( [ mt landauer buttiker tensor product ] ) we rewrite the matrix @xmath56 in the rather compact form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is obtained from @xmath65 by taking the rows and columns indexed by the set @xmath59 .",
    "decomposing the vector @xmath66 as @xmath67 and inserting ( [ tensor representation om ] ) and ( [ decomposition of z ] ) into ( [ asymmetry form ] ) yields @xmath68 here we introduced the vector @xmath69 and the hermitian matrix @xmath70 which is positive semi - definite for any @xmath71 however , since @xmath65 is doubly stochastic for any @xmath0 , the matrix @xmath72 must have the same property and it follows from corollary [ apx ai doubly substochastic matrices ] proven in [ apx bound on ai for special classes of matrices ] @xmath73 hence , independently of @xmath0 , @xmath74 is positive semi - definite for any @xmath75 finally , we can infer from ( [ asymmetry form k ] ) that @xmath62 is positive semi - definite for any @xmath61 , which obeys ( [ bound on asymmetry index ds matrices ] ) .",
    "consequently , with ( [ asymmetry form ] ) , we have the desired bound on the asymmetry index of @xmath56 as @xmath76 this bound , which ultimately follows from current conservation , constitutes our first main result .",
    "+    we will now demonstrate that ( [ asymmetry bound ] ) puts indeed strong bounds on the kinetic coefficients . to this end",
    ", we extract a @xmath77 principal submatrix from @xmath57 by a two - step procedure , which is schematically summarized in figure [ fig matrix reduction ] . in the first step , we consider the @xmath78 principal submatrix of @xmath57 given by @xmath79 which arises from @xmath57 by taking only the blocks with row and column index equal to @xmath11 or @xmath80 . from ( [ asymmetry bound ] ) we immediately get with @xmath81 @xmath82 next , from ( [ la2 matrix ] ) , we take a @xmath77 principal submatrix @xmath83 where @xmath84 with @xmath85 denotes the @xmath86-entry of the block matrix @xmath58 . by virtue of proposition [ apx dominance of principal submatrices",
    "ai ] proven in [ apx bound on ai for special classes of matrices ] , the inequality ( [ ai la2 matrix ] ) implies @xmath87 which is equivalent to requiring the hermitian matrix @xmath88 to be positive semi - definite .",
    "since the diagonal entries of @xmath89 are obviously non - negative , this condition reduces to @xmath90 finally , expressing the @xmath91 again in terms of the @xmath92 yields the new constraint @xmath93 this bound that holds for the elements of any @xmath77 principal submatrix of the full matrix of kinetic coefficients @xmath57 , irrespective of the number @xmath2 of terminals is our second main result .",
    "compared to relation ( [ new bound 2 ] ) , the second law only requires @xmath94 to be positive semi - definite , which is equivalent to @xmath95 and the weaker constraint @xmath96 note that the reciprocal relations ( [ time reversal symmetry for l ] ) do not lead to any further relations between the kinetic coefficients contained in @xmath94 for a fixed magnetic field @xmath3 .    at this point",
    ", we emphasize that the procedure shown here for @xmath77 principal submatrices of @xmath57 could be easily extended to larger principal submatrices .",
    "the result would be a whole hierachy of constraints involving more and more kinetic coefficients .",
    "however , ( [ new bound 2 ] ) is the strongest bound following from ( [ asymmetry bound ] ) , which can expressed in terms of only four of these coefficients .",
    "in this section , we explore the consequences of the bound ( [ asymmetry bound ] ) on the performance of various thermoelectric devices .      a thermoelectric heat engine uses heat from a hot reservoir as input and generates power output by driving a particle current against an external field or a gradient of chemical potential @xcite . such an engine can be realized within the multi - terminal model by considering the terminals @xmath97 as pure probe terminals , which mimic inelastic scattering events while not contributing to the actual transport process .",
    "this constraint reads @xmath98 by assuming the matrix @xmath99 to be invertible , we can solve the self - consistency relations ( [ probe terminal constraints ] ) for @xmath100 obtaining @xmath101 after inserting this solution into ( [ phenomenological equations ] ) and identifying the heat current @xmath102 leaving the hot reservoir and the particle current @xmath103 , we end up with the reduced system @xmath104 of phenomenological equations . here , the effective matrix of kinetic coefficients is given by @xmath105 and the affinities @xmath106 and @xmath107 have to be chosen such that @xmath108 for the model to work as a proper heat engine .",
    "+ @xmath109 is not a principal submatrix of the full onsager matrix @xmath57 and therefore the bound ( [ asymmetry bound ] ) does not apply directly .",
    "however , @xmath109 can be written as the schur complement @xmath110 ( see [ apx ai schur complements ] for the definition ) , the asymmetry index of which is dominated by the asymmetry index of @xmath57 as proven in proposition [ apx dominance of schur complement ] of [ apx ai schur complements ] .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath111 or , equivalently , @xmath112 this constraint shows that whenever @xmath113 , the entropy production ( [ entropy production ] ) must be strictly larger than zero , thus ruling out the option of dissipationless transport generated solely by reversible currents for any model with a finite number @xmath2 of terminals .",
    "for any @xmath114 this constraint is weaker than ( [ new bound 2 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the onsager coefficients in ( [ he bound on onsager coefficients ] ) are not elements of the full matrix ( [ onsager matrix ] ) but rather involve the inversion of @xmath115 defined in ( [ he inverted matrix ] ) .",
    "still , this constraint is stronger than the bare second law , which requires only @xmath116 irrespective of whether or not @xmath109 is symmetric .",

    "furthermore , @xmath141 attains its global maximum @xmath149 at the finite value @xmath150 .",
    "remarkably , both @xmath133 and @xmath151 approach the same asymptotic value @xmath152 for @xmath153 .      in the preceding section , we discussed the performance of the multi - terminal model if it is operated as a heat engine . quite naturally",
    ", we can change the mode of operation of this engine such that it functions as a refrigerator .",
    "the resulting device consumes electrical power from which it generates a heat current from the cold to the hot reservoir .",

    "however , like for the heat engine , our analysis reveals that such a high performance refrigerator would need to be equipped with an infinite number of terminals .      by an isothermal , thermoelectric engine ,",

    "+ for completeness , we emphasize that the efficiency ( [ ar efficiency ] ) used here differs from the coefficient of performance @xmath232 used as a benchmark parameter in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since @xmath161 is unbounded in the linear response regime , maximization with respect to @xmath233 or @xmath234 would be meaningless .",
    "we have studied the influence of broken time reversal symmetry on thermoelectric transport within the quite general framework of an @xmath2-terminal model .",
    "our analytical calculations prove that the asymmetry index of any principal submatrix of the full onsager matrix defined in ( [ onsager matrix ] ) is bounded according to ( [ asymmetry bound ] ) .",
    "this somewhat abstract bound can be translated into the set ( [ new bound 2 ] ) of new constraints on the kinetic coefficients .",
    "any of these constraints is obviously stronger than the bare second law and can not be deduced from onsagers time reversal argument .",
    "furthermore , we note that it is straight forward to repeat the procedure carried out in section 3.2 for larger principal submatrices , thus obtaining relations analogous to ( [ new bound 2 ] ) , which involve successively higher order products of kinetic coefficients .",
    "investigating this hierarchy of constraints will be left to future work .",
    "+ after the general analysis of the transport processes in the full multi - terminal set - up , we investigated the consequences of our new bounds on the performance of the model if operated as a thermoelectric heat engine .",
    "we found that both the maximum efficiency as well as the efficiency at maximum power are subject to bounds , which strongly depend on the number @xmath2 of terminals . in the minimal case @xmath131 , we recover the strong bounds already discussed in @xcite .",
    "although our new bounds become successively weaker as @xmath2 is increased , they prove that reversible transport is impossible in any situation with a finite number of terminals . only in the limit @xmath132",
    "we are back at the situation discussed by benenti @xcite , in which the second law effectively is the only constraint .",
    "we recall that for @xmath131 our bounds can indeed be saturated as balachandran @xcite have shown within a specific model . whether or not it is possible to saturate the bounds for higher @xmath2 remains open at this stage and constitutes an important question for future investigations .",
    "+ like in the case of the heat engine , the bound on the maximum coefficient of performance we derived for the thermoelectric refrigerator becomes weaker as @xmath2 increases .",
    "interestingly , the situation is quite different for the isothermal engine and the absorption refrigerator considered in the sections 4.3 and 4.4 .",
    "the bounds on the respective benchmark parameters equal those of the three - terminal case irrespective of the actual number of terminals involved .",
