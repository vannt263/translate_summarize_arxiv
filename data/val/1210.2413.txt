    "the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) features in the large - scale matter distribution have recently drawn attention as a standard ruler by which the geometry of the universe can be directly measured @xcite .",
    "these features in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum and the matter power spectrum today are imprints from the acoustic oscillations in the primordial photon - baryon plasma that recombined at @xmath5 .",
    "the features in the power spectrum appear at multiples of the sound horizon scale at recombination , making them effective standard rulers .",
    "measuring the bao wiggles at several redshifts yields geometric measurements of the universe  the hubble parameter , @xmath6 , and the angular diameter distance , @xmath7  that constrain properties of the dark energy that dominates the cosmic energy content at @xmath8 and is the current leading theory for the accelerated expansion of the universe . since the first detection of the bao signal @xcite , several experiments have been undertaken to use these features for precision cosmology , including the sloan digital sky survey iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( sdss - iii boss ; @xcite ) , wigglez @xcite , and the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ; @xcite ) , as well as a number of planned future experiments , such as the subaru prime focus spectrograph ( pfs ; @xcite ) , euclid @xcite , bigboss @xcite , and the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) .",
    "all of these experiments target individual galaxies with spectroscopic observations .",
    "rather than targeting individual objects , a 21 cm intensity mapping experiment can detect fluctuations in neutral hydrogen emission on large scales @xcite , with two dimensions corresponding to angles on the sky , and the third line - of - sight dimension arising from the differential redshifting of 21 cm line emission as a function of distance .",
    "after reionization , the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations is expected to be a biased tracer of the matter power - spectrum , since the remaining neutral hydrogen resides in high - density , self - shielded regions such as in galaxies and other collapsed halos @xcite . as a result",
    ", 21 cm intensity mapping experiments present a promising complement to spectroscopic galaxy surveys for bao science .",
    "several 21 cm intensity mapping experiments have been proposed , including the prototype cylindrical radio telescope ( crt ; formerly hshs , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment ( chime ) , baoradio @xcite , the bao from integrated neutral gas observations experiment ( bingo ; @xcite , and an ongoing experiment with the green bank telescope ( gbt ; @xcite ) .",
    "the flexibility in angular and spectral responses of radio interferometers , which measure the power spectrum both parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight @xcite , gives 21 cm bao the ability to survey larger cosmological volumes and operate over a wider range of redshifts than current spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys . as a result ,",
    "the 21 cm bao signal has the potential for probing expansion throughout and beyond the critical epoch when dark energy comes to dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "furthermore , a 21 cm intensity mapping experiment can probe redshifts @xmath9 with roughly uniform sensitivity , without complications arising from sky emission lines in the optical / near - infrared .",
    "the 21 cm signal can be used to constrain the location of the bao peaks as a function of redshift , and thereby measure the magnitude and time - evolution of dark energy .",
    "21 cm bao experiments can draw on the considerable investments in low - frequency radio astronomy developed in the past decade for studies of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) . in this paper , we present the baryon acoustic oscillation broadband and broad - beam ( baobab ) array , a new experiment , building on the legacy of the precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper ; @xcite ) and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; @xcite ) , for measuring the 21 cm hi power spectrum at a redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : baobab ] , we present a system architecture for the baobab instrument . in  [ sec : predictions ] , we forecast the sensitivity and cosmological constraints that will be achieved by baobab .",
    "we consider several possible challenges and extensions for this approach in  [ sec : discussion ] , and conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout this work",
    "we assume the wmap7 best fit @xmath10cdm cosmological model : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the past decade has seen significant progress in the design , construction , and calibration of low - frequency interferometric arrays toward the goal of detecting the highly - redshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization .",
    "the technologies used in baobab inherit from two eor experiments  paper and the mwa  but with several significant modifications to optimize the instrument for bao science . the entire signal chain will be re - tuned to operate between 600900  mhz .",
    "these frequencies corresponds to redshifted 21 cm emission between @xmath16 , a band chosen for several reasons .",
    "first , these moderate redshifts complement the undergoing lower redshift galaxy surveys like boss by probing what is currently a relatively unexplored volume of the universe .",
    "secondly , at these frequencies , commercially available amplifiers and cables provide suitable low - noise performance that would not be obtainable at higher frequencies ( lower redshifts ) .",
    "furthermore , this band also avoids the bright sky noise and ionospheric effects that complicate lower frequency ( higher redshift ) observations .",
    "baobab will be a non - phase - tracking , broadband array of beam - formed tiles . by lowering the field - of - view of each element ,",
    "the use of beamformed tiles like the mwa will significantly increase baobab s power spectrum sensitivity over that of an array of the equivalent number of single dipoles , without increasing the correlator demands .",
    "each tile will consist of 4 scaled versions of the paper sleeved - dipole design and groundscreens , electronically beamformed to point to zenith .",
    "two linear polarization signals from each tile enter a digital signal processor that computes both auto- and cross - correlation products and outputs the results locally to disk . a block diagram is given in fig .",

    "even when the boss - ly@xmath39 forest constraints between redshifts 2 and 3 are added , baobab still provides valuable information , serving to increase the fom by @xmath40 .",
    "we break this discussion into two parts . in  [ sec : shortcomings ] , we consider two components of our analysis which may be overly simplistic : our model of the baobab primary beam as a frequency - independent gaussian , and our foreground emission model . we discuss the effects any shortcomings in these models could have on our conclusions . in ",
    "[ sec : improving ] , we consider the fact that sample variance is the dominant source of uncertainty in our measurements , and present future approaches that could improve the dark energy constraints possible with the baobab instrument .      a effect that could modify the predictions presented in this work is the use of an overly simplistic model for the baobab beam : a frequency independent gaussian .",
    "although this model is sufficient to calculate sensitivities , the effects of a more realistic beam model on the delay spectrum foreground removal technique will necessitate further investigations .",
    "the principle cause for concern is from the existence of frequency - dependent grating - lobe structure associated with the tile .",
    "these sidelobes can introduce apparent frequency structure into otherwise spectrally smooth foreground emission .",
    "if this structure represents a significant increase in the size of the delay - space convolving kernel , it will move the foreground contaminated region to higher @xmath41 values .",
    "if the size of the effect is large enough to push foreground emission on the shortest baselines beyond the first bao peak , the predicted cosmological constraints could be reduced .    note , however , that the frequency - independent gaussian beam is not as bad an assumption as it might first appear .",
    "our choice to neglect the frequency evolution of the beam is partially motivated by experience with the paper dipole beam , which , like baobab , uses a modified dual - polarization ",
    "sleeved \" dipole design to limit the frequency evolution of the beam to only @xmath42 over the @xmath43  mhz band @xcite . of more concern",
    "are the grating lobes introduced by beamforming in tiles .",
    "if we were trying to image the sky , ignoring the grating lobes would be unjustified . with the delay spectrum approach , though , the issue is not the existence of the sidelobes , but their frequency dependence .",
    "if the frequency fourier transform of the beam pattern is particularly broad  corresponding to rapid evolution of the beam pattern with frequency  then foreground emission will have a similarly broad footprint in delay space , compromising the 21 cm signal .",
    "of course , the grating lobes themselves will change position as a function of frequency , introducing additional structure not in the paper beam . however , as argued in p12b , it is difficult for an element only several wavelengths across to possess such frequency structure . as stated in  [ sec : dspec ] , we will postpone a detailed investigation of these effects to a future paper with empirical studies of the beam shape , and focus here on array sensitivities , for which the gaussian model is sufficient .    as noted in  [ sec : baobab128 ] , our constraints on @xmath17 are significantly limited by foreground emission .",
    "we illustrate this effect in figure [ fig : fgloss ] , which shows the sampling pattern of baobab-132 at 750 mhz in the ( @xmath44-@xmath45)-plane , highlighting those modes discarded as contaminated by our foreground model of  [ sec : dspec ] .     in the ( @xmath44-@xmath45)-plane .",
    "modes are marked as either uncontaminated or contaminated by foregrounds using our model of  [ sec : dspec ] .",
    "foregrounds limit @xmath46 to , e.g. , @xmath47 for @xmath48 , leading to the relatively poor @xmath17 measurement and high correlation .",
    ", width=336 ]    foreground contamination effectively excludes modes where @xmath49 , i.e. , transverse modes .",
    "this has the effect of significantly degrading the achievable constraints on @xmath17 .    while our foreground model presented in ",
    "[ sec : dspec ] is empirically motivated , accurate predictions for foreground emission will need to come from early baobab arrays or other 21 cm experiments .",
    "we briefly explore the effect of changing the size of the additive component of our foreground model arising from the spectral smoothness ( or lack thereof ) the emission . for our fiducial model",
    ", this term has a magnitude of @xmath50 ; as test cases , we analyze the constraints obtainable with baobab if this term is changed by @xmath51 .",
    "this has the effect of moving the cutoff between contaminated and uncontaminated modes in figure [ fig : fgloss ] up or down by @xmath52 .",
    "the effect of increasing this term ( i.e. , if foreground emission is not as spectrally smooth as predicted ) is to degrade the significance of our bao detections in each of the redshift bins by @xmath53 , our @xmath6 , @xmath17 , and @xmath54 constraints by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 percentage points , respectively .",
    "reducing the foreground emission footprint in @xmath41-space ( i.e. , if foregrounds are spectrally smoother than predicted ) has similar effects with the opposite sign : the significance of our bao detections in each band are increased by @xmath58 , our @xmath6 , @xmath17 , and @xmath54 constraints are improved by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 percentage points , respectively . from this analysis ,",
    "it is clear that foreground emission can significantly alter the achievable constraints on @xmath17 , but ultimately , the success of baobab will not be determined by the details of foreground spectral properties .      as discussed in  [ sec : baobab128 ] , sample variance dominates the uncertainties in power spectrum measurements from baobab .",
    "however , measuring a new set of independent modes is not a trivial undertaking . by using a close - packed array",
    ", baobab completely samples the @xmath59-plane out to some maximum baseline length .",
    "therefore a simple array rotation or reconfiguration will not yield new samples .",
    "furthermore , in our highest redshift bin of @xmath60 , the longest baseline in the 132-tile array probes a transverse @xmath41-mode of @xmath61 ( and at lower redshift , this longest baseline corresponds to an even larger value of @xmath44 ) . at this scale and smaller",
    ", most bao information is being lost to non - linear damping effects .",
    "therefore , while a larger array will beat down thermal noise faster , the cosmological returns from increasing the array size beyond @xmath62 tiles are limited , since effectively no new modes with significant bao information will be probed .    as an upper - limit to the constraints obtainable with a single - declination , @xmath63 square degree , 132-tile baobab observation ( as opposed to our fiducial observation targeting three declination fields )",
    "we compute the results of a completely sample variance limited survey , i.e. , one where thermal noise uncertainties have been set to 0 ( although modes are still excluded using our foreground emission model ) .",
    "this sample variance limited 132-tile baobab observation yields distance scale uncertainty of @xmath64 , averaged over our whole band ( compared with @xmath3 for our fiducial 1-year observation of 3 independent declination fields ) . for comparison , a 10-year ( 14,400 hour ) , one declination observation with the same array yields a distance scale uncertainty of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , while better constraints can come from a longer observation , obtaining measurements of new modes to beat down sample variance is clearly the optimal way to proceed .",
    "there are two ways forward to achieve this goal : map a different volume of the universe ( as with our fiducial experiment ) or recover foreground corrupted modes .",
    "we consider each of these approaches in turn .    since baobab is a zenith - pointing , drift - scanning telescope , to map a new area of the sky , it will either need to be relocated to a different latitude or tilted to point towards a different patch of sky .",
    "either option is potentially feasible , as even a 132-tile baobab experiment spans less than 20 meters . with a primary beam full - width half - max of @xmath66",
    ", there are @xmath67 independent pointings in declination that baobab can target .",
    "since our fiducial observation already targets three declination fields , mapping every declination could in principle yield up to @xmath68 reductions in the error bars over the results presented .    the other way to potentially measure new modes and beat down sample variance is to recover samples we have considered corrupted by foregrounds .",
    "there are two ways foregrounds compromise baobab observations .",
    "the first is the limited observing time per - day , set by galactic emission , which we have treated as irreparably corrupting all samples , even those in principle recoverable with the delay transform .",
    "if it is possible to observe all 24 hours of right ascension , as opposed to the 8 considered here , the constraints from a single observing season will increase by a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "while it is unlikely that all 24 hours of right ascension will be workable , our fiducial value of 8 hours per day , motivated by observations with present eor experiments , may well be conservative , since galactic synchrotron emission has significantly fallen in brightness compared to eor frequencies .    even when observing a  cold patch , \" foregrounds corrupt large scale @xmath41-modes with a footprint moving to smaller scales as baseline length increases (  [ sec : dspec ] ) .",
    "if these modes could be retrieved , they could significantly increase the volume of fourier space that baobab can probe . as an upper - limit",
    ", we calculate the obtainable power spectrum constraints ignoring all foreground contamination .",
    "the result is that a 1-year ( 1440-hour ) observation in each of three independent declination fields yields a distance scale uncertainty of 1.4% combined over the entire redshift range , an increase of @xmath70 over the same observation including foreground emission .",
    "in particular , we note that a foreground - free observation yields errors of @xmath71 on @xmath17 at redshifts of 0.67 , 0.89 and 1.18 , respectively  a factor of @xmath72 improvement over the predictions for an observation including the effects of foreground emission .",
    "while an analysis of foreground removal techniques is beyond the scope of this work , this result is suggests that foreground removal may be the way to improve constraints on @xmath17 .    as an order of magnitude estimate",
    ", we can consider whether a foreground removal or subtraction scheme might be more effective in the bao band than at eor frequencies . at @xmath73 , the 750-mhz",
    "bao 21 cm power spectrum reaches @xmath74 , compared with a peak brightness at eor frequencies of 150 mhz reaching @xmath75 .",
    "the steep spectrum galactic synchrotron emission has a spectral index of -2.5 , and so will fall by a factor of @xmath76 in units of temperature squared .",
    "( extragalactic point sources are less steep spectrum , and so will not fall off in brightness as steeply .",
    "therefore , this estimate can be considered a lower limit on the foreground - to - signal ratio ) . roughly speaking , then",
    ", the foreground - to - signal ratio is unchanged compared with eor experiments , suggesting that a foreground isolation scheme like the delay - spectrum technique is still likely the most viable approach for first - generation experiments limited in collecting area .",
    "in this work we have presented a concept for a new experiment using the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen to probe cosmology at @xmath2 .",
    "the bao broadband and broad - beam array ( baobab ) will incorporate both the hardware and analysis infrastructure developed for 21 cm experiments at higher redshifts .",
    "the hardware design will borrow heavily from the precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper ) and the murchsion widefield array ( mwa ) , using a scaled version of the paper dipoles as a feed element , tiling dipoles as done by the mwa , and modifying the casper fpga / gpu paper correlator to perform full dual - polarization cross - correlations of all elements .",
    "significant improvements to the system temperature will be brought about through state - of - the - art uncooled , low - noise amplifiers .",
    "relative to paper , the collecting area will be substantially increased through the use of tiles of 4 dipoles combined through a beamformer , as demonstrated by mwa efforts .",
    "although we have largely avoided specific cost - estimates , it is fair to say that this infrastructure is obtainable at a fraction of the cost of the @xmath77-million dollar ground - based optical redshift surveys .    on the analysis side",
    ", baobab will use the maximum redundancy configurations and delay spectrum foreground removal techniques presented in @xcite and @xcite to enhance sensitivity to fourier modes along the line - of - sight .",
    "motivated by the science of baryon acoustic oscillations , baobab will utilize extremely close - packed arrays to maximize the number of short baselines .",
    "the sensitivity calculations presented here show that baobab will achieve several milestone measurements over our anticipated staged deployment process .",
    "a @xmath78-element baobab system will yield high significance detections of the hi power spectrum , and constrain the evolution of the cosmic neutral hydrogen fraction from @xmath79 to 1.5 as well as the bias of dlas . over the same wide redshift range ,",
    "a @xmath62-element system will allow for a first detection of the bao features in the power spectrum , and yield errors on the distance scale @xmath54 at the several percent level . when combined with our current constraints on dark energy , including those forthcoming from the boss and planck experiments , baobab s measurements result in substantial increase in the dark energy task force figure of merit , representing constraints on the nature and time evolution of dark energy over a wide range of cosmic history ."
