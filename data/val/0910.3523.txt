    "the tendency of ferromagnetic colloidal particles to form aggregated structures , stabilized by anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions , was insightfully discussed by pierre - gilles de gennes and philip pincus in 1970 @xcite .",
    "this tendency is central to the structure @xcite , and hence the phase equilibria @xcite and dynamics @xcite , of magnetic colloids in organic solvents ( ferrofluids ) .",
    "the earliest direct observations of chain - like structures were obtained by hess and parker using electron microscopy @xcite but remarkably the _ quantitative _ experimental study of strong pair correlations began only in 2003 with cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies by philipse and co - workers @xcite .",
    "this delay in confirming the classic predictions of de gennes and pincus partly reflects the extreme opacity of most ferrofluids , which precludes both direct microscopy of bulk phases and light scattering as methods to elucidate structure . alongside x - ray and neutron scattering ,",
    "these two methods have been central to the widespread progress made in understanding other forms of colloidal aggregation since 1970 @xcite .",
    "the same experimental difficulties have also made it hard to study structural relaxation , which in macroscopically isotropic fluids at equilibrium can be quantified by the time - dependent correlator ( directly accessible in inelastic scattering experiments , where available ) @xcite @xmath8   \\right\\ } } \\label{eq : s}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 .",
    "difficulties with scattering methods mean that many relaxation studies on ferrofluids have been limited to strictly @xmath10 properties such as frequency dependent bulk magnetic susceptibilities @xcite or magnetoviscous and rheological properties @xcite .",
    "it is increasingly possible for computer simulation methods to fill the gaps in our experimental knowledge of structural relaxation in complex fluids .",
    "however , for ferrofluids , such simulations have previously been oversimplified in their neglect of hydrodynamic interactions between particles .",
    "these interactions are mediated by the intervening solvent ",
    "an essentially incompressible , newtonian fluid of viscosity @xmath11 and density @xmath12 .",
    "previous simulations using molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite , monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite , and brownian dynamics ( bd ) @xcite of dipolar fluids , while each capable of generating the correct equilibrium statistics governed by the boltzmann distribution , are all compromised by either the neglect or incomplete treatment of thermal noise and many - body hydrodynamics . in particular bd , while capturing the overdamped , diffusive dynamics of an isolated particle ( with diffusion constant @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the particle radius ) fails to correlate the brownian motion of two or more particles in the correct manner . as a result",
    ", @xmath4 will have the wrong time dependence .    in this work ,",
    "we present simulation results for dipolar colloids generated using the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method .",
    "this approach treats full hydrodynamic interactions , at least for the colloids simulated here , which have a sufficiently repulsive soft - core potential to ensure that particles do not approach one another too closely .",
    "( the presence of such a potential avoids large hydrodynamic lubrication forces in thin fluid films between two solid particles in close contact , whose treatment within lb is possible , but costly @xcite . ) alongside lb , other methods that fully treat hydrodynamics include force methods @xcite , stokesian dynamics ( sd ) and accelerated stokesian dynamics ( asd ) @xcite , and stochastic rotation dynamics @xcite .",
    "( dissipative particle dynamics does so also , but without proper control of noise terms as required here @xcite . )",
    "few of these methods have yet been used to treat systems with long - range interactions , although an sd method has been applied to ferrofluids in shear flow @xcite , and asd was recently used to address charge - stabilized colloids at low ionic strength @xcite .",
    "we are aware of no _ systematic _ application of these methods to the equilibrium dynamics of dipolar fluids in three dimensions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ methods ]",
    "we outline the numerical methodology , and in section [ statics ] present results for equilibrium structure as calculated by bd , lb , and mc methods .",
    "( these should be , and nearly are , identical . ) then in section [ dynamics ] we present results for @xmath4 and its orientational analogs , focusing on a like - for - like comparison between bd ( no hydrodynamics ) and lb ( full hydrodynamics ) .",
    "in section [ kinetics ] we present an analysis of transient behavior , addressing the time evolution of the static structure including an analysis of cluster statistics .",
    "finally in section [ conclusions ] we give our conclusions and discuss prospects for future work .",
    "we use the lattice boltzmann method for a fluid incorporating spherical solid particles @xcite . in this method , the density , momentum , and stress in the fluid are associated with various moments of a kinetic distribution function @xmath15 , defined at each site @xmath16 on a 3d lattice and acting on a space of 19 discrete velocities @xmath17 that connect neighboring sites in one timestep ( including the null velocity ) . setting the lattice parameter , timestep , and",
    "mean fluid density @xmath18 all to unity defines a set of lb units that we use in results quoted below .",
    "( of course , many physical quantities can be expressed in dimensionless forms , from which these units cancel out . )",
    "each of our spherical colloidal particles has a hard - core radius @xmath19 and resides off - lattice ; its surface then cuts the lattice bonds at a set of links at which fluid and particle interact by momentum transfer .",
    "this transfer is achieved by a ` bounce - back on links ' algorithm @xcite .",
    "the force and torque on a colloidal particle are found by summing contributions across the boundary links ; particle velocities and angular velocities are then updated via a standard molecular dynamics routine @xcite .",
    "the thermal noise , responsible for colloidal brownian motion , is generated entirely within the fluid and is fully included in the description of the fluid momentum @xcite , using a method reported previously @xcite .",
    "momentum transport then causes the random forces ( and torques ) felt by different particles to become correlated , in accord with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which relates random forces to the matrix of particle mobilities @xmath20 .",
    "this matrix obeys @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the velocity of particle @xmath23 in response to a force @xmath24 on particle @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are cartesian indices . in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions , @xmath20 is not diagonal in particle indices , but has long - range correlations .",
    "in contrast to sd - based methods , lb avoids explicit computation of @xmath20 .",
    "each colloidal particle has the same mass @xmath27 as the nominal volume of fluid that it displaces ; @xmath28 is the volume of a colloidal particle .",
    "the fluid viscosity is set to @xmath29 and the temperature to @xmath30 ; these choices represent the best compromise we have found between numerical accuracy and efficiency for the systems under study here .",
    "( for a discussion of parameter optimization in lb see @xcite . ) based on these parameters , the particle velocity relaxation time is @xmath31 , and the time scale for fluid momentum to equilibrate around a particle is @xmath32 .",
    "the single - particle diffusivity is @xmath33 , giving a diffusive timescale of @xmath34 .",
    "this offers a reasonably wide domain in which to study short time diffusion , even in the case of strongly interacting particles ( as here ) where the short - time diffusion time window closes off at @xmath35 with @xmath36 a typical surface - to - surface separation between adjacent particles .",
    "our choices for other ( reduced ) simulation parameters  to be defined below  correspond to typical values for real ferrofluids .",
    "time - dependent results are expressed in units of @xmath37 , which means that for @xmath38 , they will be directly relevant to almost any real ferrofluid system .    to avoid computationally expensive lubrication contacts between particles ( as mentioned in section [ introduction ] ) we introduce a short - range , soft - core repulsion @xmath39 acting at separations beyond the hard - core radius @xmath40 .",
    "( the latter coincides with the hydrodynamic radius @xcite . ) we tested various options for @xmath39 and found that a satisfactory choice is @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the surface - to - surface separation for spheres whose centers are @xmath44 apart , and @xmath45 is a short - range cutoff .",
    "we set the cutoff separation @xmath46 , which in terms of the hard - core diameter is @xmath47 .",
    "this comprises a truncated and shifted inverse power law potential ; note that the interaction force remains divergent at contact ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "although structural and magnetic properties of ferrofluids are known to be quite insensitive to the choice of short - ranged repulsive potential @xcite , our choice could qualitatively describe the effects of a screened electrostatic repulsion .",
    "the case of steric stabilisation is more complex since the polymer layer will have , in addition , a direct effect on the hydrodynamic forces .",
    "the introduction of @xmath39 reduces discretization errors in the noise forces which become acute when fluid nodes are excluded from the space between particles .",
    "( since absence of fluid entails absence of noise , particles that are too close to one another to have fluid nodes between them effectively feel a reduced temperature . )",
    "in fact this issue , rather than avoidance of lubrication contacts _ per se _ , prevents efficient use of a shorter - range soft - core potential than the one we have chosen ; the effect of using such a potential is to exaggerate the peak in the pair distribution function @xmath49 for particles at close contact ( as though particles become colder at close separations ) . even with our choice of @xmath39 , this deviation remains visible in the data of section [ statics ] for the largest dipole strength used , but this is considered acceptable .",
    "indeed , in the current state of the art for lb , errors of several percent from this and other sources such as shape discretization remain unavoidable . to reduce these",
    "further is straightforward in principle : one simply increases @xmath14 .",
    "however , for a fixed number of particles at a given volume fraction @xmath0 , the system volume must then be increased as @xmath50 , with a further @xmath51 increase in the run time to reach @xmath52 .",
    "thus a factor 2 increase in @xmath14 , as would be required to give a worthwhile reduction in discretization errors , entails a 32-fold increase in computational resource .",
    "the total colloid - colloid pair potential in our simulations is the sum of short - range soft - core ( @xmath53 ) and long - range dipolar ( @xmath54 ) contributions : @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the center - center separation vector for particles @xmath23 and @xmath25 , @xmath57 denotes a unit vector pointing along the dipole of particle @xmath23 , and @xmath58 where @xmath59 \\label{dipoleu}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a unit vector pointing along the center - center separation vector .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath2 is a dimensionless , dipolar coupling constant defined such that two colloids at hard core contact ( @xmath61 ) , with dipoles mutually aligned and parallel to @xmath16 , have @xmath62 .",
    "this ` nose - to - tail ' parallel conformation is of lowest energy ; the other minimum - energy conformation is ` side - by - side ' antiparallel , for which @xmath63 ( with corresponding energy maxima on reversing the direction of one dipole ) . in experimental ferrofluids @xmath2 values up",
    "to @xmath64 are readily available ; much larger ones can be achieved but are relatively unusual @xcite .",
    "all of our simulations were performed in a cubic box of side @xmath65 with periodic boundary conditions for both fluid and particles .",
    "a standard ewald summation technique was deployed to handle the long - range aspect of the dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "the ewald sum computes dipolar forces directly in real space for particle pairs with separation @xmath66 , a cutoff distance , and deals with the remainder in reciprocal space . to allow a parallel implementation using domain decomposition , which is important given the relatively high computational requirements associated with the lb fluid @xcite",
    ", we chose @xmath67 in all cases .",
    "this is small enough that some parallelism is possible , but not so small that the number of terms required in the reciprocal space sum for acceptable accuracy becomes unwieldy .",
    "a convergence factor @xcite of @xmath68 was chosen , with wavevectors @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "these parameters were optimised using established methods @xcite . finally ,",
    "following normal practice , the ewald sum boundary condition at infinity was chosen to be  conducting \" , i.e. , the dipolar ( magnetic ) susceptibility of the surroundings is infinite .",
    "this removes a zero - wavevector , bulk - magnetization term from the hamiltonian which , in the opposite extreme of vacuum boundary conditions , can lead to unphysically small polarised domains and hence slow down simulation convergence @xcite .    for comparison with our lb results , a bd algorithm was set up within the colloidal md module of our lb code , deploying standard techniques to generate the required langevin dynamics with independent noise acting directly on each particle .",
    "the inertia of the particles is retained but the many - body hydrodynamics are replaced by a stokes drag that is independent of the location of other particles . by setting exactly the same value for @xmath52",
    ", we thus create an algorithm which differs from lb solely in the omission of many - body hydrodynamics .    to further validate both codes , and to monitor the achievement of boltzmann equilibrium",
    ", canonical monte carlo simulations were performed in a cubic simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions applied @xcite .",
    "the long - range dipolar interactions were handled using the ewald summation with conducting boundary conditions , a convergence factor @xmath74 , and wavevectors @xmath69 with @xmath75 .",
    "the maximum translational and orientational displacement parameters were adjusted independently to give acceptance rates of approximately @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ; it is efficient to employ low acceptance rates for translations of particles with hard cores , due to the possibility of rapidly identifying overlaps . for each state point",
    "considered , we performed equilibration runs of @xmath78 mc cycles , where one mc cycle consisted of , on average , one attempted translation or rotation per particle .",
    "production runs consisted of @xmath79 mc cycles .",
    "our lb work was performed primarily on lattices of size @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "the colloid volume fraction is given by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the number of colloids .",
    "for the larger system size at a volume fraction @xmath84 , a run of @xmath85 timesteps required 56 hours on 64 cores of a cluster of 3ghz intel dual - core processors . for resource reasons most of our results on fully equilibrated samples ( @xmath86-@xmath87 at @xmath88 ) concern the smaller @xmath89 .",
    "bd and mc runtime requirements were modest in comparison .",
    "in this section we confirm that our lb algorithm generates , to acceptable accuracy , the boltzmann distribution for thermal equilibrium properties , as does our bd code , and that both are in agreement with mc data .",
    "this is of course necessary if the dynamical data in subsequent sections are to be trusted .",
    "such agreement is not automatic but is in fact a very demanding test of the ability of our lb algorithm to generate correlated noise forces satisfying the fluctuation dissipation condition . in particular , without adopting the methods of @xcite ( in which noise terms are applied to not only the hydrodynamic but also the local modes of the fluid degrees of freedom ) we would not be confident of achieving such agreement . even with these methods , lb parameter values must be carefully chosen to maintain acceptable performance .",
    "we have already mentioned that correct treatment of noise was the limiting factor in our choice of @xmath39 ; it also prevents us using a much larger @xmath90 value ( which sets the intrinsic noise level in the lb fluid ) and/or a much smaller viscosity @xmath11 .",
    "either step could in principle drastically reduce the run time required to reach the basic timescale @xmath52 for colloidal diffusion .",
    "thus the control of discretization errors within the noise sector currently remains the primary efficiency bottleneck in the application of large - scale lb simulations to colloidal diffusion .",
    "table [ tab : energy ] shows time - averaged energy data for various simulation runs .",
    "those for @xmath91 have fully equilibrated ( run times @xmath92 ) as judged by convergence of the energy parameters to their long - term averages .",
    "the results indicate excellent agreement between lb and the other methods at @xmath7 and @xmath93 , and adequate agreement ( errors of less than 5% ) at @xmath88 .",
    "some runs with the larger system size , @xmath94 , are also reported in the table .",
    "these have run times @xmath95 and while their energies appear to have saturated , those at @xmath88 are showing continued structural evolution by other measures ( such as cluster statistics ; see section [ kinetics ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the reported energy discrepancies for these runs may include systematic errors arising from incomplete structural equilibration , and should not be taken as a guide to the relative accuracy of the lb algorithm .",

    "in this paper we have presented results for the equilibrium and transient dynamics of dipolar colloids with many - body hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "these were gained by incorporating the ewald summation for the long - range dipolar interactions into our existing lattice boltzmann algorithms , which handle the hydrodynamic forces by explicit propagation of momentum across the fluid residing on a lattice .",
    "the colloidal particles themselves are off - lattice and undergo molecular dynamics ; brownian motion is caused by fluctuating momentum transfer from the surrounding solvent , which creates correlated noise of the kind demanded by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for hydrodynamically interacting particles .",
    "the full , fluid - driven noise can easily be replaced by local noise with no correlation between particles , creating a bd code .",
    "the resulting comparison of the lb and bd results allows the effect of many - body hydrodynamics to be isolated .    at the volume fractions ( @xmath98 ) and interaction strengths ( @xmath99 , @xmath3 ) studied here , these effects are easily measurable but remain relatively modest .",
    "quantitative shifts in both short - time and long - time diffusion were observed for wavevectors near and below the peak in the static structure factor .",
    "likewise , we found shifts in transient relaxation rates for the cluster size distribution on approach to steady state following a quench from @xmath100 . in all cases ,",
    "the system with hydrodynamic interactions relaxes more slowly than the equivalent bd system .",
    "however , for the range of volume fraction and interaction strengths studied , this slowing down was rarely by more than a factor of two .",
    "although it is possible that stronger hydrodynamic effects would be observed in the dynamics of a quiescent system at larger @xmath0 and @xmath2 , their effects on long - time relaxation appear already to be decreasing for the largest values studied here .",
    "this could be a precursor to entering a glassy regime in which the crossing of local energy barriers limits relaxation rates ; within this regime , conventional wisdom holds that hydrodynamics affects relaxational dynamics only through a scale factor @xcite .",
    "however , despite the observation of slow transients and the difficulty of attaining full equilibration , even at @xmath101 and @xmath88 , we find no direct evidence for a glassy regime ; specifically we see no separate @xmath102 and @xmath103 relaxation processes .",
    "this is not surprising as our simulations run for at most @xmath104 , and a truly glassy system would certainly not approach equilibrium , as ours do , on this time scale .    within our lb framework",
    ", there are serious obstacles to achieving much longer physical timescales using reasonable computational resources .",
    "one bottleneck remains the accurate treatment of noise ; currently this requires a very large separation ( order @xmath105 in our runs ) between the simulation timestep and @xmath52 .",
    "future algorithmic work will , we hope , partially address this issue .",
    "our simulations were engineered to avoid the very large hydrodynamic forces that arise when hard colloidal particles come into lubrication contact .",
    "this was done by including a soft - core repulsion to maintain adequate separation between particle surfaces even when strongly bonded by the dipolar interactions .",
    "it is possible that these lubrication effects could enhance the relative role of hydrodynamic interactions , by further slowing the timescale for bond breakage and re - formation . to address this effect specifically ( in a bulk periodic system ) an algorithm such as asd",
    "might be more suitable than lb .",
    "note that within lb one can include a routine to address lubrication forces via an sd - like algorithm , but the computational scaling becomes bad when there are large clusters of particles in mutual lubrication contact .",
    "we do not know how well asd would perform under such conditions , as compared to the purely repulsive interactions studied in @xcite .    even without lubrication",
    ", the effects of many - body hydrodynamics could , of course , also become much more pronounced in various nonequilibrium situations .",
    "these include the rheological response to steady and/or time - dependent shearing , and perhaps the nonlinear response to large orienting fields .",
    "we hope to address one or more of these topics in future work .",
