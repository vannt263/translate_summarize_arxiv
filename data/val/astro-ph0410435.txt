    "analyses of the faint carina dsph have revealed that it contains a variety of stellar populations ( e.g. ,  [ 4 ] ) , exhibiting prominent old ( @xmath111gyr ) and intermediate - age ( 56 and 3gyr ) populations .",
    "this implies that carina must have undergone several star forming ( sf ) episodes with at least three significant pulses . despite this wide spread in ages ,",
    "its colour - magnitude diagram features a remarkably narrow rgb .",
    "the reason for that can be an age counteracting spread in metallicities , where metal rich , young stars have colours comparable to the older , more metal poor ones .",
    "such a possible age - metallicity degeneracy can be overcome if accurate and independent [ fe / h ] measurements are obtained so that the remaining parameter of age can be estimated from isochrones .",
    "moreover , the overall shape and spatial variations of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) itself contain valuable implications for analysing carina s unusual sf history .",
    "in the course of an eso large programme , we observed 1257 red giants covering five fields in carina out to the tidal radius .",
    "our observations were performed during 23 nights with the multi - object spectrograph flames at the vlt in low - resolution mode , centered at the near infrared cat .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard flames reduction pipline . since sky contamination from bright emission lines is strong in the cat region , we calculated an average sky - spectrum from 20 dedicated skyfibres , which then was carefully subtracted from the science spectra . typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios for our spectra lie between 25 and 150 pixel@xmath2 .",
    "after rejection of foreground stars and stars with too low a s / n , 487 radial velocity members were analysed .",
    "finally , metallicities were derived from the reduced equivalent width w@xmath3 ( [ 1],[5 ] ) .",
    "the resulting mdf for our 487 red giants is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "1 . it is peaked at an average [ fe / h ] of @xmath4dex , which is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic study of  [ 6 ] , who found a value of @xmath5dex .",
    "we find a dispersion of @xmath6=0.25dex and as fig .",
    "1 implies , the full spread of [ fe / h ] is at least one dex .",
    "this suggests that the wide range in age is in fact counteracted by a wide spread in metallicity , which can explain carina s narrow rgb and confirms that a complex mixture of stellar populations as in carina does not necessarily contradict the rgb s narrowness .",
    "the different stellar populations in carina have also different spatial distributions , where , the intermediate age red clump stars are clearly concentrated towards the center compared to the old hb ( see [ 1 ] )",
    ". thus we plot in fig .  1 ( bottom panel ) the error - weighted mdfs for three different regions along the galaxy s axes .",
    "while the curves for the central region and larger minor axis distances do not differ largely and also resemble those along the major axis , there is a shift of the mdf s peak towards the metal poor end by 0.2dex when concentrating on the outer , northwestern region ( lower axis distances ) .",
    "1 also overplots a model curve from  [ 3 ] , showing the predicted mdf for carina .",
    "this model uses a sf efficiency of 0.1gyr@xmath2 and a galactic wind efficiency at the lower end of wind rates in dsphs .",
    "such a lower wind rate nicely explains the smooth decline of the observed mdf towards the metal rich end , as a higher wind rate would expel enriched gas more efficiently thus preventing the formation of this metal rich tail .",
    "secondly , the low sf rate is able to explain the metal poor peak of the mdf in terms of a moderate enrichment history .",
    "however , remaining caveats are the higher fraction of predicted extremely metal poor stars and the lower number of metal poor stars around [ fe / h]@xmath7 , which can be understood in the context of the low infall timescale of gas assumed in dsphs ( [ 3 ] ) . with our accurate [ fe / h ] measurements at hand we will in the next steps pursue the underlying age distribution and use the abundance ratios from our multi - object high - resolution spectroscopy to further unravel the mechanisms governing carina s evolutionary history .    .",
