    "the vacuum considered as a medium has become a popular picture in quantum field theory . with reservations due to",
    "the lack of understanding of non - perturbative vacuum phenomena , it is astonishing that analogies between the quantum vacuum and classical media are frequently useful .",
    "one particular example is represented by the propagation of light in a vacuum which is modified by various external environments , e.g. , electromagnetic ( em ) fields , temperature , geometric boundary configurations , gravitational background and non - trivial topologies .",
    "the concept of drawing the analogy is common to all of these cases : vacuum polarization allows the photon to exist as a virtual @xmath0-pair on which the various vacuum modifications can act . under certain assumptions , this influence on the loop process can effectively be described by an immediate influence of a ( generally non - linear ) medium on the photon itself , e.g. , by refractive indices .",
    "this program was carried out among others by adler @xcite , brezin and itzykson @xcite for magnetic fields , by drummond and hathrell @xcite for gravitation , and by scharnhorst @xcite and barton @xcite for a casimir configuration .",

    "a new physical insight into the phenomenon of photon propagation in non - trivial vacua has been given by latorre , pascual an tarrach @xcite .",
    "comparing the known velocity shifts arising from different vacuum modifications , they were able to identify an intriguing general , so - called `` unified '' formula covering all these cases .",
    "they concluded that the polarization and direction averaged velocity shift is related to the ( renormalized ) background energy density @xmath1 with a `` universal '' numerical coefficient    @xmath2    where @xmath3 denotes the electron mass and @xmath4 .",
    "( in the case of gravitation , one @xmath5 has to be replaced by the combination @xmath6 involving newton s constant ) .",
    "however , a complete derivation of the `` unified formula '' has not been given up to now .",
    "in the case of gravitation , light was shed on the problem by shore @xcite who proved a polarization sum rule that represents a generalization of eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , he pointed out that the `` universal '' coefficient in eq.([1 ] ) can be related to the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor in the case of weak em background fields .",
    "one of the most remarkable features concerning vacuum induced velocity shifts certainly is the fact that @xmath7 is not intrinsically forbidden in quantum field theories .",
    "this seems to offer the possibility of superluminal propagation , e.g. , in curved spaces and casimir vacua .",
    "both examples share the property of a possible negative energy density @xmath1 in eq.([1 ] ) .    the two questions , whether the signal ( @xmath8wave front ) velocity indeed exceeds @xmath9 and whether superluminal propagation is observable in principle , could be resolved by calculating the velocity shift in the infinite frequency limit .",
    "but this is presently out of reach , because a resummation of the derivative expansion has to be achieved .",
    "however , without being able to answer these questions , let us just say that we find no grounds for violation of ( micro- ) causality in accordance with @xcite . for a causality violation , a space - like signal _ and _ lorentz invariance ( in the gravitational case : strong principle of equivalence ) are necessary conditions .",

    "@xmath62 depends functionally on @xmath63 , which is , as usual , defined via the functional integral over the fluctuating fields . taking the expectation value of @xmath62",
    "hence leads back to integrating over the field configurations which respect the modified vacuum .",

    "it is an exact statement in the sense of effective theories .",
    "now , the terminology `` modified qed vacuum '' should be clarified : from the derivation of the light cone condition , it is obvious that the implicit space - time dependence of @xmath13 should only be contained in the field variables . furthermore , the vacuum has to fulfil the demand for passivity .",
    "otherwise the light cone condition ( [ 22 ] ) only represents a zeroth order approximation of the infinite sum over intermediate states in eq.([23c ] ) .    as a third remark ,",
    "we want to point out that the sum over polarization states is not necessary for the derivation of a light cone condition . by summing",
    ", we even exclude the study of birefringence from the formalism which is certainly the most important experimental application @xcite .",
    "but for a projection on the polarization eigenstates , the @xmath67-terms have to be rewritten in terms of the field strength tensor which is practically impossible for arbitrary @xmath13 .    in the remainder of the section ,",

    ", the @xmath62-factor will depend on all the variables and parameters of @xmath13 and hence will naturally be neither universal nor constant .",
    "besides , the daunting structure of the @xmath62-factor will simplify in the case of small corrections to @xmath71 . as will be shown in sect .",
    "iv , the denominator then reduces to 1 .",
    "another representation of the light cone condition is found by averaging over propagation directions , i.e. , integrating over @xmath72    @xmath73    for @xmath74 and @xmath75 being even of lower order , this reduces to    @xmath76    where @xmath1 denotes the ( renormalized ) energy density of the modified vacuum .",
    "in his paper , shore @xcite suggested a deeper connection between the velocity shift and the scale anomaly . for the heisenberg - euler lagrangian",
    ", he showed that the coefficients of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 terms in the scale anomaly are precisely those appearing in the velocity shift for the different polarization states .    within the framework developed so far ,",
    "we will attempt to clarify the relation between the scale anomaly and the velocity shift .",

    "it is already obvious from eq.([30 ] ) that there is no immediate connection between @xmath83 and the velocity shift eq.([25 ] ) .",
    "the findings of shore arise from the special structure of the heisenberg - euler lagrangian where @xmath84 . in general , higher - order mixed terms are not forbidden by gauge , lorentz or parity invariance . referring to eq.([30 ] ) , the introduction of the scale anomaly appears to be artificial rather than interpretable .",
    "even shore s conjecture that the sign of the scale anomaly is linked to the sign of the velocity shift can not be maintained .",
    "instead , we favour the pure effective action formulation , i.e. , the left - hand side of eq.([30 ] ) , since it offers a new intuitive picture . referring to eq.([25 ] ) , the value and sign of the velocity shift result from the competition between the vev of the energy - momentum tensor and the @xmath62-factor .",
    "both are a priori neither positive nor bounded by symmetry principles .",
    "let us restrict the following investigation to the case of small corrections to the maxwell lagrangian , i.e. ,    @xmath85    due to the similarity to the ( 2-d ) poisson equation , we will call @xmath62 from now on the _ effective action charge _ in field space .",
    "the classical vacuum @xmath16 is _ uncharged _ and hence @xmath86 .",

    "it is therefore reasonable to presume localized effective action charge distributions centred upon the origin in field space .",
    "the results of sect .",
    "iv will confirm this charge - like picture .",
    "up to now , the light cone condition might be regarded as a nice frame without a picture enclosed , since it is much easier to talk about all - loop or non - perturbative effective actions than to calculate one .",
    "indeed , the effective actions which we are going to insert will not reach beyond two - loop order .",
    "their general structure can be characterized by    @xmath90    where @xmath91 contains the correction terms .",
    "regarding the denominator expression of the effective action charge ( [ 30b ] ) , the scale anomaly @xmath75 is of the same order as @xmath92 .",

    "@xmath180 is plotted in fig .",
    "the influence of temperature causes the effective action charge to evaporate .",
    "numerical results astonishingly indicate that eq.([62 ] ) is already a reasonable approximation for @xmath181 ( error@xmath182 ) where real @xmath100-pair creation is energetically impossible and the vacuum is essentially modified by a photon gas .",
    "this excludes the interpretation that eq.([62 ] ) is a pure threshold effect of pair production .    to complete the high temperature / zero field analysis of the light cone condition we need the vev of the energy - momentum tensor which is given by ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath183",
    "the integer variables @xmath184 and @xmath185 denote the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom at a given temperature . for qed",
    ", we obtain    [ 64 ] @xmath186    it is appropriate to employ eq.([27 ] ) for the light cone condition . using our findings in eqs.[([61 ] ) , ( [ 36vor ] ) , ( [ 63 ] ) , ( [ 64a ] ) ] , we recover the well - known result @xcite for low temperature    @xmath187    which according to fig . 3 is valid for @xmath188 ( error@xmath182 ) ( @xmath189k ) . substituting eq.([62 ] ) into eq.([27 ] ) and using eqs.[([63 ] ) , ( [ 64b ] ) ] for @xmath190 , we finally arrive at the velocity of soft photons moving in a photon and ultrarelativistic @xmath191 gas    @xmath192    in eqs.[([65 ] ) , ( [ 66 ] ) ] , we found that the velocity shift increases proportional to @xmath193 for low temperature but approaches a constant value in the high - temperature limit .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the effective action charge which evaporates sufficiently fast compared to the increase of the energy - momentum tensor vev .",
    "obviously , the shift described by eq.([66 ] ) remains small ; therefore the deviation from the vacuum velocity does not become seriously important ( e.g. , for the construction of cosmological models ) .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that , if the temperature exceeds the masses of further charged particles , each particle will contribute additively to @xmath62 and will increase the respective number of degrees of freedom @xmath184 or @xmath185 .",
    "the combination of thermal and casimir phenomena is in itself worthwhile studying , because both effects enter the formalism via boundary conditions but lead to opposite results . in the following ,",
    "we want to investigate where and why the respective effect dominates the velocity shift .",
    "the determining order parameter is the dimensionless combination @xmath194 .",
    "nevertheless , the plate separation @xmath107 has to be considered as a macroscopic quantity ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "first , we consider the low - temperature region .",
    "according to brown and maclay @xcite , the vev of @xmath56 depending on @xmath107 and @xmath196 is given by    @xmath197    for the parallel plate configuration ( @xmath198 ) . the light cone condition eq.([25 ] ) for a propagation perpendicular to the plates ( @xmath199 ) yields    @xmath200    in the low-@xmath196 limit , the @xmath201-term can be neglected and we only rediscover scharnhorst s result .",
    "but we do not find an additional velocity shift proportional to @xmath193 which could have been expected from eq.([65 ] ) .",
    "this clearly arises from the fact that none of the ( quantized ) perpendicular modes can be excited at low temperature .",
    "the @xmath201-term in eq.([68 ] ) will become important for @xmath202 , i.e. , @xmath203k for @xmath204 m .",
    "this shows that the scharnhorst effect is not sensitive to temperature perturbations .    for increasing temperature , we encounter an intermediate temperature region characterized by the condition @xmath205 which corresponds to @xmath206ev@xmath207mev .",
    "this implies that @xmath208 is a justified approximation and the thermal contribution of an @xmath191 gas does not have to be taken into account .",
    "using further results of brown and maclay @xcite    @xmath209    we find    @xmath210    in this limit , only the modifications caused by the black body radiation become important .",
    "a term proportional to @xmath211 as a consequence of certain missing zero - point fluctuations does not occur , since higher ( perpendicular ) modes have been thermally excited .    for @xmath190",
    ", we will certainly recover eq.([66 ] ) with negligible @xmath212 casimir corrections .",
    "anyway , the concept of solid plates is ( at least experimentally ) meaningless in this domain .      for low temperature as well as for weak fields ,",
    "thermal phenomena decouple from magnetic vacuum modifications , because the effective action charge is not sensitive to weak influences .",
    "the velocity shifts can simply be described by an addition of the respective above - calculated ones .",
    "the only non - trivial interplay can be found in the domain of strong fields in hot surroundings ( e.g. , hot neutron stars ) .",
    "our intension is to evaluate the thermal effective action charge contribution given in eq.([56 ] ) in this limit .",
    "therefore , we substitute @xmath213 ( @xmath214 )    @xmath215    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty ( -1)^n \\text{e}^{-\\frac{ea}{4t^2 }    \\frac{n^2}{z}}\\ , .\\label{71}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this representation , it is obvious that the integral is dominated by small values of @xmath60 for weak fields ( @xmath216 ) and vice versa , i.e. , large @xmath60 for strong fields .",
    "we are interested in the latter , so we expand the term in the square brackets for @xmath217 : @xmath218\\to -\\case{1}{3 } z$ ] . following the manipulations of eqs.[([58 ] ) , ( [ 59 ] ) ] , we arrive at    @xmath219    note that it was not necessary to impose any conditions on the magnitude of @xmath196 to arrive at eq.([72 ] ) .",
    "but , as mentioned above , the field - temperature phenomena decouple for @xmath220 due to the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath221 in eq.([72 ] ) ; hence , @xmath222 . using similar techniques as applied in app .",
    "b , the high - temperature limit of eq.([72 ] ) can be determined .",
    "the result for @xmath190 and @xmath223 is    @xmath224    where @xmath225const .",
    "( see eq.([b14 ] ) . to obtain the complete effective action charge @xmath62",
    ", we add the strong - field contribution @xmath226 which was found in eq.([43nach ] )    @xmath227    where we have introduced the convenient dimensionless variables @xmath228 and @xmath229 which satisfy @xmath230 .",
    "equation ( [ 84 ] ) describes the same features of the effective action charge which we have encountered in previous examples : @xmath62 is centred upon the origin in field space , decreases proportional to @xmath231 and evaporates with increasing temperature .    to calculate the velocity shift ,",
    "we need the energy density which consists of three parts    @xmath232    the last term of eq.([85 ] ) is connected with the lagrangian via the free energy ( density ) according to    @xmath233    the leading mixed contribution @xmath234 to @xmath13 is found in ref.@xcite    @xmath235    we finally arrive at the polarization and propagation direction averaged velocity shift for strong fields and high temperature    @xmath236    at @xmath237 , we find a minimal velocity shift    @xmath238    at the same time , this number approximately sets the scale of a typical velocity shift for strong fields consistent with the one - loop approximation .",
    "this is also confirmed by the result of eq.([46nach ] ) .",
    "in this work , we studied light propagation in non - trivial qed vacua in the geometric optics approximation . for any given qed effective action describing soft photons , we derived the light cone condition averaged over polarization states .",
    "this result generalizes the `` unified formula '' found by latorre , pascual and tarrach @xcite which turned out to be the low - energy limit of our light cone condition .",
    "we furthermore clarified the connection between light velocity shifts and the scale anomaly suggested by shore @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our findings do not indicate an immediate connection hinting at deeper physical grounds .",
    "instead , the structure of the light cone condition suggests introducing the intuitive physical picture of an effective action charge @xmath62 showing a localized profile in field space centred upon the origin .",
    "this charge directly characterizes the properties of the modified vacuum which are responsible for velocity shifts .    within this conceptual framework , we analysed several modified qed vacua and calculated the respective modified velocities .",
    "the inverse velocities are equal to the refractive indices of the modified vacua in the low - frequency limit .",
    "hence , these velocities are phase as well as group velocities  the latter due to their independence of frequency . in the low - energy limit , we recovered all known results which were already perfectly described by the `` unified formula '' .        finally , we investigated the influence of temperature on the velocity shifts .",
    "the evaporation of the effective action charge turns out to be the dominating effect in the high - temperature domain .",
    "it causes the velocity shift to approach a constant value .",
    "only when a strong magnetic field is involved , does the light cone condition fail to provide for a bound of the velocity shift in our examples .",
    "but we expect higher - order loop corrections to stop an unbounded growth of the velocity shift by inducing a faster decrease of the effective action charge far from the origin in field space .",
    "referring to the light cone condition , the sign of the velocity shift is in general determined by the sign of the effective action charge _ and _ the vacuum energy density .",
    "however , up to now , we have not been able to construct an example which exhibits a negative effective action charge in qed .",
    "this might be a general characteristic of the abelian theory .",
    "indeed , the one - loop effective action of a covariant constant chromomagnetic background field @xcite ( naively ) possesses a negative effective action charge .",
    "we would like to conclude with the remarkable observation that parity violating terms in the effective action proportional to @xmath239 will not contribute to the effective action charge in the zero field limit , since the equation for @xmath62 is of poisson type .",
    "thus , e.g. , the existence of dyons @xcite will not cause a velocity shift in the weak field limit .          for this",
    ", we have to decompose it into simple parts which one can handle by standard methods of dimensional regularization .",
    "note that the integral is convergent , since the prescription @xmath241 is implicitly understood .",
    "the last three terms of the expression in square brackets are already in a convenient shape . in the following ,",
    "we thus consider only the remaining first two terms .",
    "the strategy is similar : we extract a term proportional to @xmath244 and integrate by parts .",
    "@xmath245 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & h\\int\\limits_0^{\\text{i}\\infty}dz\\text{e}^{-2hz } \\left [ \\frac{\\cosh    z\\sinh z}{z } -\\cosh^2 z \\right ] \\frac{1}{\\sinh^2 z } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & h\\int\\limits_0^{\\text{i}\\infty}dz\\text{e}^{-2hz}\\!\\left[\\!\\left(\\ !    2h \\!+\\!\\case{1}{z}\\!\\right ) \\coth z+ \\left(\\ ! h\\!+\\!\\case{1}{z }",

    "each of these can be integrated separately by introducing an extra factor of @xmath247 and rotating the contour onto the positive real axis . at the end ,",
    "the @xmath248-poles cancel and we arrive at the result given in eq.([44 ] ) in the limit @xmath249 .          since the appearance of bessel functions reflects the @xmath252 topology which is the finite - temperature field theory space , the techniques described in the following are certainly useful for further finite - temperature applications .                    where we have substituted @xmath261 . with some care",
    ", the parameter integrals @xmath262 and @xmath263 can now be expanded .",
    "we have to pay special attention to the process of taking the limit @xmath264 for the @xmath265 s and their derivatives .",
    "we can circumvent possible convergence problems at the lower bound by a repeated integration by parts of the square root terms .",
    "using the short form                  the constant @xmath272 that appears in the calculation of the effective action charge for high temperature and strong fields is obtained by similar techniques .",
