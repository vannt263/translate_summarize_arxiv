    "the evolution of radio and x - ray emission at earlier times , also implied in the present paper , has been described by , e.g. bkv11 , who showed , in particular , that the evidence for strong shock modification comes primarily from radio data .",
    "efficient acceleration of the cr proton component is needed to produce significant shock modification leading to a soft and concave cr electron spectrum in sn 1987a , which well fits the observed nonthermal radio emission and x - ray spectra if the downstream magnetic field strength @xmath5 is as high as @xmath6  mg .",
    "such a high field leads to significant electron synchrotron losses that cut off the high - frequency x - ray part of the synchrotron spectrum , consistent with x - ray observations .",
    "the required magnetic field strength can presumably be attributed to its nonlinear amplification near the snr shock by the cr acceleration process itself @xcite .    as a consequence of the efficient production of the cr nuclear component , which is accompanied by strong magnetic field amplification ,",
    "sn  1987a is expected to be a potential source of @xmath4-rays for the h.e.s.s .",
    "however , the flux of tev emission predicted in bkv11 exceeds the upper limit obtained by h.e.s.s .",
    "it is suggested here that this inconsistency is the result of an overestimate of the csm gas density , in particular , of the mass of the equatorial ring ( er ) .",
    "the present work uses the same canonical values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the stellar ejecta mass , @xmath7 , distance , @xmath8 , hydrodynamic explosion energy , @xmath9 , and ejecta velocity distribution as in bkv11 , but takes into account the detailed radio continuum observations by @xcite and @xcite . in particular",
    ", the present work makes use of recent extensive csm modeling in terms of three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite ( in the sequel referred to as potter14 ) .",
    "an approximate prediction of the future nonthermal emission from sn  1987a for the coming decades is given .",
    "the densest part of the csm , which lies within the range @xmath10 of the elevation angle @xmath11 around the equatorial plane , is then considerably less dense than what was adopted in bkv11 .",
    "this is the main reason for the re - examination of the cr production in sn  1987a and the associated nonthermal emission .",
    "to study the propagation of the sn shock through the csm , the results of potter14 for the angular range @xmath10 relative to the equatorial plane are used .",
    "the most efficient cr and nonthermal emission production presumably takes place within this region .",
    "this is roughly consistent with radio observations @xcite .",
    "the adopted radial profile of the gas number density @xmath12 in this region is represented in figure  [ f1 ] . within the selected elevation range , it consists of several different morphological structures : ( i ) the wind bubble of the blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor star @xcite at @xmath13  cm with gas density @xmath14  @xmath15 , ( ii ) the h  ii region @xcite at @xmath16  cm with @xmath17  @xmath15 , ( iii ) the so - called hourglass region at @xmath18  cm with @xmath19  @xmath15 , and ( iv ) the free red supergiant ( rsg ) wind region at @xmath20 with @xmath21  @xmath15 ;",
    "the properties of structures ( iii ) and ( iv ) directly follow from potter14 . within the smaller elevation angle region of @xmath22 ,",
    "the same radial profile includes the equatorial ring inside the h  ii region ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "its gas number density is chosen here to be distributed according to the relation @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the central ( maximal ) density of the er , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 denote the total mass , radius , and width of the er , respectively .",
    "below , the values @xmath28 , @xmath29  cm , and @xmath30 are used .",
    "these parameter values are taken in order to fit the observed shock and radio - emission dynamics .",
    "they turn out to be consistent with the values used by potter14 .",
    "the csm described above differs significantly from the csm adopted in bkv11 .",
    "first of all , the er mass , albeit that of the ionized material only , @xmath28 @xcite , is considerably smaller than that used by bkv11 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "second , the csm behind the er is less dense .",
    "these factors , as demonstrated below , lead to a considerable reduction of the expected nonthermal emission , in particular , of the @xmath4-ray emission , compared with the results of bkv11 .",
    "the propagation of the forward sn shock through the csm is modeled in the spirit of a spherically symmetrical approach .",
    "it approximates the shock and its effects as the weighted sum of two independent spherically symmetric shocks , propagating into , respectively , two different radial gas number density profiles of the csm , shown in figure  [ f1 ] : the first profile ( region 1 ) belongs to an azimuthally symmetric region of elevation angles @xmath11 near the equatorial plane @xmath32 , and the second , analogous profile ( region 2 ) , corresponds to the innermost @xmath22 .",
    "then , each quantity q , characterizing the number of accelerated crs and the amount of emission produced by these crs , is determined by the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the spherically symmetric values corresponding to the profiles that characterize the two regions 1 and 2 , respectively , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the filling factors in the solid angle of these regions .    cr production by the sn shock at high latitudes @xmath37 is neglected here because the gas density in this region is considerably lower ( see potter14 ) .",
    "we also neglect cr production at the reverse shock for the reasons given in bkv11 .",
    "the question is , of course , to what extent such an approximate treatment remains consistent as a function of time with the real snr shock sweeping across the real csm to reach larger and larger radial distances .",
    "a priori the decrease of the gas density with elevation angle , symmetric to the equatorial plane , suggests this to be a roughly stable process .",
    "however , effects like the engulfment of the er clearly imply some non - radial shock propagation aspects . such effects are also apparent in the three - dimensional simulations of potter14 .",
    "in addition , the ring is clumpy , even though @xcite found indications that these hot spots are now gradually dissolving .",
    "this type of effect should primarily influence the detailed time dependence of the particle acceleration and hadronic @xmath4-ray emission rather than the global acceleration properties of the system .",
    "therefore , in a gross sense , the used mosaic of spherical shocks appeears to be an adequate overall approximation .      as in bkv11 , the magnetic field strength , @xmath38 , given by the expression @xmath39 is used . here",
    ", @xmath40 denotes the sn shock speed and @xmath38 is the field far upstream , presumably amplified by the crs of the highest energy . in the same sense , @xmath41 is the mass density far upstream .",
    "the high downstream magnetic field @xmath42  mg , where @xmath43 denotes the total shock compression ratio , is required to reproduce the observed radio and x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the shock radius @xmath44 and speed @xmath40 again follows the scheme of @xcite , but see also bkv11 , as does the evaluation of the proton injection rate @xmath45 and of the electron - to - proton ratio @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows @xmath44 and @xmath40 , as the shock propagates in the csm corresponding to region 2 , together with the latest radio data @xcite . in the case of region 1",
    ", the shock speed time profile @xmath47 does not contain the local minimum around @xmath48 days ; this is the main difference from the results presented in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "iteratively fitting the theoretical quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 to the spatially integrated radio synchrotron spectra up to the year 2013 @xcite leads to a constant value for @xmath51 , whereas the value @xmath52 at @xmath53 year ( figure  [ f3]a ) is due to the assumption that , leaving the h  ii region , the nuclear injection fraction should , after @xmath54 year , go back to its value before the age of 10 years . during the ages between about 10 and 30 years",
    "the compressed and largely azimuthal magnetic field of the h  ii region should have depressed nuclear injection , consistent with the softening of the spatially integrated radio spectrum ( with index @xmath55 ) as shown in figure  [ f3]b .",
    "this figure also shows that outside the h  ii region , the shock is significantly modified relative to a pure gas shock for which the total shock compression ratio @xmath43 and the subshock compression ratio @xmath56 would both have a value of 4 .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath49 determines the amount of shock modification , in particular , the decrease of the subshock compression ratio @xmath57 relative its value of 4 for an unmodified shock . since crs with relatively small energies",
    "are produced near the subshock , the value @xmath57 directly determines the shape of the electron energy spectrum at energies below @xmath58  gev  which produce synchrotron emission in the radio range  and vice versa .",
    "therefore , as in all similar cases , the proton injection rate @xmath49 is inferred from a fit of the resulting theoretical spectral index @xmath55 of the integrated radio synchrotron emission to the observed value .",
    "the quality of this fit can be ascertained from figure  [ f3]b , where the best calculated time profile @xmath55 is presented together with the observational data .    from the epoch",
    "@xmath59 year onwards the value of @xmath55 decreases until the epoch @xmath60 year @xcite and is assumed to start to increase again at @xmath61 year .",
    "this appears to be consistent with recent measurements by @xcite and , especially , @xcite .",
    "however , the increase is not as fast as one would expect from the behavior of the local @xmath57 .",
    "this occurs because at subsequent epochs , the gas number density and , consequently , also the amount of freshly injected electrons and the magnetic field strength , are much smaller than when the shock was in the h  ii region .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron emission of those latter electrons , convected downstream in that higher magnetic field , remains dominant .",
    "for similar reasons , the variation in the shock compression ratio @xmath43 at an age 10,00012,000 days , caused by the rapid decrease of the upstream gas number density @xmath62 , does not significantly affect the integrated radio synchrotron emission flux , and the spectral index @xmath63 remains essentially independent of @xmath43 .    using these educated guesses for @xmath64 and @xmath46 the calculated flux of radio emission @xmath65 at frequency @xmath66  ghz",
    "is presented in figure  [ f4 ] together with the observational data obtained with the atca instrument @xcite . for those times where the radio flux has also been measured , the calculation is perfectly consistent with the observations . according to the calculation , the rapid growth of radio emission in the epochs @xmath67 year is due to the increase of the number of accelerated cr electrons , which is proportional to the swept - up mass within the h  ii region . for the adopted value of the outer boundary of the h  ii region , @xmath68  cm , the snr shock reaches this boundary after @xmath54 year , and the peak of radio emission is reached . even at later epochs ,",
    "@xmath69 years , the radio synchrotron emission will still be dominated by the contribution of the swept - up matter of the h  ii region .",
    "the flux of radio emission is expected to decrease gradually by a factor of about 10 during the 10 years after 2017 .",
    "due to its considerably lower gas density , the contribution of the swept - up hourglass matter will become essential only for @xmath70 year , when the radio emission starts to grow slowly again .",
    "the calculated @xmath4-ray energy flux density above 3 tev as a function of time , shown in figure  [ f5 ] , is dominated by the @xmath71-decay component at all energies . since a significant part of the shock surface",
    "is expected to be tangential , and therefore to not efficiently inject / accelerate nuclear crs , the overall number of accelerating crs is normalized by a factor of @xmath72 , as previoously argued by @xcite and bkv11 .    as is clear from figure  [ f5 ] , the region 1 , which contains the er , the densest structure , contributes dominantly only during the shock propagation through the er , which is during days 700010,000 .",
    "according to figure  [ f5 ] , the maximal energy flux density of tev emission @xmath73  ev @xmath1 s@xmath2 was achieved at day 9000 , and after that epoch it decreased continuously due to the decrease of the csm gas density . since the radial gas density profile is much thinner compared with the one used earlier bkv11 , the peak value of the expected flux of tev emission is now lower and the tev emission expected for the future is considerably lower .    the most recent upper limit for the tev emission obtained by the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes during the period 2005 - 2012 @xcite ( see figure  [ f5 ] ) is roughly consistent with this prediction .    according to the calculation ( see figure  [ f5 ] ) , the most promising time for the detection of sn",
