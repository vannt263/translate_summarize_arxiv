    "we examine several views of cauchy s foundational contribution in analysis .",
    "cauchy s foundational stance has been the subject of an ongoing controversy .",
    "the continuing relevance of cauchy s foundational stance stems from the fact that cauchy developed some surprisingly modern mathematics using infinitesimals .",
    "the following four items deserve to be mentioned :    \\(1 ) _ cauchy s proof of the binomial formula ( series ) for arbitrary exponents_. the proof exploits infinitesimals .",
    "d.  laugwitz @xcite argues that this is the first correct proof of the formula .",
    "\\(2 ) _ cauchy s use of the dirac delta function_. over a century before dirac , cauchy exploited `` delta functions '' to solve problems in fourier analysis and in the evaluation of singular integrals . such functions were defined in terms of an infinitesimal parameter , see freudenthal  @xcite , laugwitz @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the sum theorem has been the subject of a historical controversy , ever since a.  robinson @xcite proposed a novel reading of the sum theorem that would make it correct .",

    "laugwitz concurs , see e.g. his 1989 text @xcite .",
    "post - weierstrassian historians tend both ( a ) to reject cauchy s infinitesimals , claiming they are merely shorthand for limits , and ( b ) to claim that his 1821 sum theorem was false . the 1821 formulation of the sum theorem may in the end be too ambiguous to know what cauchy s intention was at the time , if cauchy himself knew .. ] the four examples given above hopefully illustrate the interest in understanding the nature of cauchy s foundational contribution .    in section  [ stance ] , we provide a re - appraisal of cauchy s foundational stance , including cauchy s theory of orders of infinitesimals based on orders of growth of functions ( subsection  [ orders ] ) ; how cauchy null sequences become infinitesimals ( subsection  [ second ] ) ; a detailed textual study of the related portions of the _ cours danalyse _ ( subsection  [ two ] ) ; an analysis of cauchy s key term _ toujours _ , strengthening the hypothesis of his sum theorem ( subsection  [ micro1 ] ) ; an examination of some common misconceptions in the cauchy literature ( subsection  [ 25 ] ) .    in section",

    "cauchy s 1821 _ cours danalyse _ @xcite presented only a theory of infinitesimals of polynomial rate of growth as compared to a given `` base '' infinitesimal  @xmath1 .",
    "the shortcoming of such a theory is its limited flexibility .",
    "since cauchy only considers infinitesimals behaving as polynomials of a fixed infinitesimal , called the  base \" infinitesimal in 1823 @xcite , his framework imposes obvious limitations on what can be done with such infinitesimals .",
    "thus , one typically ca nt extract the square root of such a `` polynomial '' infinitesimal .",
    "what is remarkable is that cauchy did develop a theory to overcome this shortcoming .",
    "cauchy s theory of infinitesimals of arbitrary order ( not necessarily integer ) is noted by a.  borel @xcite ( see below ) .    in 1823 , and in more detail in 1829 , cauchy develops a more flexible theory , where an infinitesimal is represented by an arbitrary _ function _ ( rather than merely a polynomial ) of a base infinitesimal , denoted  @xmath8 \" , see chapter 6 in @xcite .",

    "namely , one must be able to prove a mean value theorem for arbitrary intervals , including infinitesimal ones . in 1928 , a.  fraenkel @xcite formulated a similar requirement in terms of the mean value theorem .",
    "such a klein - fraenkel criterion is satisfied by the hewitt - o - robinson theory by the transfer principle , see appendix  [ rival ] . ]",
    "cauchy did not aspire to dislodge infinitesimals from analysis ; on the contrary , he used them with increasing frequency in his work , including his 1853 article @xcite where he relied on infinitesimals to express the property of uniform convergence , as we analyze in subsection  [ micro1 ] .",
    "the nature of cauchy s infinitesimals has been the subject of an ongoing debate for a number of decades .",
    "post - weierstrassian historians tend to dismiss cauchy s _ infiniment petits _ as merely a linguistic device masking cauchy s use of the limit concept . from this perspective , cauchy s infinitesimals are alleged to represent an early anticipation of the more rigorous methods developed in the second half of the 19th century , namely epsilontic analysis .",
    "hourya benis sinaceur  @xcite presented a critical analysis of the proto - weierstrassian approach to cauchy in 1973 , pointing out in particular that cauchy s notion of limit is for the most part a kinetic one rather than an epsilontic one.pourciau @xcite argues that newton possessed a clear kinetic conception of limit similar to cauchy s , and cites newton s lucid statement to the effect that `` those ultimate ratios  are not actually ratios of ultimate quantities , but limits  which they can approach so closely that their difference is less than any given quantity  ''",
    "see newton @xcite and @xcite . the same point , and the same passage from newton , appeared a century earlier in russell ( * ? ? ?",
    "* item 316 , p.  338 - 339 ) .",
    "see also footnote  [ ult ] .",
    "] other historians have taken cauchy s infinitesimals at face value , see e.g. , lakatos @xcite , laugwitz  @xcite .",
    "the studies in the past decade include sad , teixeira , and baldino  @xcite , brting @xcite , and katz & katz @xcite .    to what extent did cauchy",
    "intend the process that he described as a null sequence  becoming \" an infinitesimal , to involve some kind of a collapsing ?",
    "cauchy did not have access to the modern set theoretic mentality ( currently dominant in the area of mathematics ) , where equivalence relation and quotient space constructions are taken for granted .",
    "one can still ponder the following question : to what extent may cauchy have anticipated such collapsing phenomena ?",
    "part of the difficulty in answering such a question is cauchy s hands - on approach to foundations .",
    "cauchy was less interested in foundational issues than , say , bolzano .",
    "cauchy , au contraire , donne rarement des dmonstrations en forme [  ] son expos a davantage des qualits de _ synthse _ que de rigueur formelle '' @xcite . ] to cauchy , getting your sedan out of the garage was the only justification for shoveling away the snow that blocks the garage door .",
    "once the door open , cauchy is in top gear within seconds , solving problems and producing results . to him , infinitesimals were the asphalt under the snow , not the snow itself .",
    "bolzano wanted to shovel away _ all _ the snow from the road .",
    "half a century later , the triumvirate shovel ripped out the asphalt together with the snow , intent on consigning the infinitesimal to the dustbin of history .    for these reasons , it is not easy to gauge cauchy s foundational stance precisely .",
    "for instance , is there evidence that he felt that two null sequences that coincide except for a finite number of terms , would  generate \" the same infinitesimal ?",
    "support for this idea comes from several sources , including a very unlikely one , namely felscher s essay  @xcite in _ the american mathematical monthly _ from 2000 , where he attacks both laugwitz s interpretation and the idea that infinitesimals play a foundational role in cauchy .. ] in his zeal to do away with cauchy s infinitesimals , felscher seeks to describe them in terms of the modern terminology of _ germs_. here two sequences are in the same germ if they agree at infinity , i.e. , for all sufficiently large values of the index  @xmath21 of the sequence  @xmath22 , that is , are equal almost everywhere .",
    "felscher s maneuver successfully eliminates the term  infinitesimal \" from the picture , but has the effect of undermining felscher s own thesis , by lending support to the presence of such `` collapsing '' in cauchy .    indeed , the idea of reading germs of sequences into cauchy is precisely laugwitz s thesis in @xcite .",
    "germs of sequences are also the basis of laugwitz s  @xmath23-calculus  @xcite , a ring constructed using a frchet filter .. ] in an editorial footnote to lakatos s essay , j.  cleave outlines a non - archimedean system developed by chwistek @xcite , involving a quotient by a frchet filter ( similarly to the schmieden ",
    "laugwitz construction ) .",
    "cleave then concludes that the relation of such infinitesimals to cauchy s is `` obvious . ''",
    "where  @xmath24 is the frchet filter on the natural numbers ( the collection of cofinite sets of natural numbers ) ( see frayne , morel , and scott @xcite ) [  ] this particular construction is not an elementary extension of  @xmath25 but there are sufficiently powerful transfer properties to enable some non - standard analysis to be performed .",
    "it may be observed that the elements of @xmath26 are equivalence classes of sequences of reals , two sequences @xmath27 and  @xmath28 being counted equal if for some  @xmath21 ,  @xmath29 for all  @xmath30 .",
    "the relation of these classes to cauchy s variables is obvious '' @xcite . ] to us it appears that the said relation requires additional argument .",
    "cauchy s published work contains evidence that he intuitively sensed a  collapsing \" involved in the passage from a null sequence to an infinitesimal .",
    "thus , the second chapter of the _ cours danalyse _",
    "@xcite of 1821 contains a series of theorems ( eight of them ) whose main purpose appears to be to emphasize the importance of the _ asymptotic _ behavior of the sequence ( i.e. , as the index tends to infinity ) .",
    "this thread is pursued in more detail in subsection  [ two ] .",
    "furthermore , he refers to his infinitesimals as  quantities \" , a term he uses in the context of an ordered number system , as opposed to the complex numbers which are always  expressions \" but never  quantities \" .",
    "in fact , the recent english translation @xcite of the _ cours danalyse _ erroneously translates one of cauchy s complex  expressions \" as a  quantity \" , and the reviewer for _ zentralblatt _ dutifully notes this error.the reviewer , reinhard siegmund - schultze , was far more sensitive to cauchy s infinitesimals on this occasion than in an earlier instance , occasioned by a review of felscher s text ; see footnote  [ rein2 ] . ]",
    "a second aspect of collapsing is the mental transformation of the process of `` tending to zero '' into a concept / noun ( as a null sequence is transformed into an infinitesimal ) , thought of as a reification , or encapsulation , of a highly compressed process . in the successive theorems in his chapter  2",
    ", cauchy seeks to collapse the initial articulation of his infinitesimal  @xmath1 as a temporally - deployed _ process _ , by deliberately leaving out the implied index ( i.e. label of the terms of the sequence ) , and by explicitly specifying and emphasizing a rival index : the exponent in a power  @xmath31 of the infinitesimal , thought of as an infinitesimal of a higher and higher order",

    "cauchy writes that a variable quantity becomes _ infinitely small _ if , etc . here ",
    "infinitely small \" is an adjective , and is not used as a noun - adjective pair .",
    "on page 27 , cauchy employs the noun - adjective combination , by referring to  infinitely small quantities \" ( _ quantits infiniment petites _",
    ", still in the feminine ) .",
    "he denotes such a quantity  @xmath1 .",
    "note that the index in the implied sequence is suppressed ( namely ,  @xmath1 appears without a lower index ) .",
    "on page 28 , he introduces a competing numerical index , namely the exponent , by forming the infinitesimals @xmath32 by the time we reach the bottom of the page ( fourth line from the bottom ) , he is already employing  infinitely small \" as a _ noun _ in its own right : _ infiniment petits _ ( in the masculine plural ) .",
    "on page 29 , theorem 1 asserts that a highest - order infinitesimal will be smaller than all the others ( infinitesimals are consistently referred to in the masculine ) .",
    "the theorem has not yet chosen a _ letter _",
    "label for the competing index ( i.e. order of infinitesimal ) .",
    "still on page 29 , theorem 2 for the first time introduces a label for the order of the infinitesimal , namely the letter  @xmath21 , as in @xmath33    on page 30 , theorem 3 introduces several different letter indices : @xmath34 for the orders of his infinitesimals .",
    "the theorem concerns the order of the sum , again compelling the student to focus on the competing orders ( at the expense of the suppressed index of the  variable quantity \" itself ) .",
    "still on page 30 , theorem 4 introduces the terminology of _ polynomials _ in  @xmath1 , and describes their orders  @xmath35 for the first time as a  sequence \" .",
    "we now have two  sequences \" : ( the variable quantity )  @xmath1 itself , whose index is implicit ( was never labeled ) , and the sequence of orders , which are both emphasized and elaborately labeled using `` primes ''  @xmath36 and double primes  @xmath37 .    in all these theorems , it is the _",

    "one faces a stark choice of either toeing the triumvirate line on the `` true '' continuum and therefore finding bjrling s arguments `` absurd '' , as pringsheim did @xcite ; or , removing the blinders so as to envision a mid-19th century anticipation of an infinitesimal - enriched continuum .",
    "cauchy clarified / modified his position on the sum theorem in 1853 . in his text @xcite , he specified a stronger condition of convergence on the b - continuum , including at  @xmath45 ( explicitly mentioned by cauchy ) .",
    "the stronger condition bars abel s counterexample .    to give a more detailed explanation of cauchy s 1853 text , note that cauchy s approach is based on two assumptions which can be stated in modern terminology as follows :    1 .",
    "when you have a closed expression for a function , then its values at `` variable quantities '' ( such as @xmath45 ) are calculated by using the same closed expression as at real values ; 2 .   to evaluate a function at a variable quantity generated by a sequence , one evaluates term - by - term .    now in 1853",
    "cauchy analyzed abel s counterexample ( without mentioning abel s name ) by first writing down the closed form of the sum of the _ remainder _ of the series .",
    "this is given by a certain integral .",
    "he proceeded to evaluate it at an infinitesimal @xmath45 using assumption  ( 1 ) .",

    "he concluded that the remainder term at this particular infinitesimal is not an infinitesimal .",
    "hence , he concluded , the `` always '' part of his hypothesis is not satisfied by abel s example .",
    "thus , cauchy s clarification / modification from 1853 amounts to requiring convergence on an incipient form of a b - continuum .",
    "some historians acknowledge his clarification / modification , and interpret it as the addition of the condition of uniform convergence , while adhering to an a - continuum framework .",
    "the recent text @xcite argued that such an interpretation is problematic .",
    "namely , cauchy states the condition in terms of a _ single _ variable , whereas the traditional definition of uniform continuity or convergence in the context of an a - continuum necessarily requires _ a pair _ of variables .",
    "cauchy specifically evokes  @xmath45 where abel s  exception / counterexample \" fails to converge .",
    "the matter is discussed in detail by k.  brting @xcite .",
    "both laugwitz and hourya benis sinaceur @xcite have exposed a number of misconceptions in the literature concerning cauchy s foundational work .",
    "five of the most common ones are reproduced below in italics .",
    "_ bolzano , cauchy , and weierstrass were all gardeners who contributed to the ripening of the fruit of the notion of limit . _    here the implicit assumption is that the weierstrassian epsilontic notion of  limit \" in the context of an archimedean continuum is the centerpiece of any possible edifice of analysis .",
    "such an assumption is questionable on two counts .",
    "first , as felix klein pointed out in 1908 , there are two parallel threads in the development of analysis , one based on an archimedean continuum , and the other exploiting an infinitesimal - enriched continuum .. ] one risks pre - judging the outcome of any analysis of cauchy by postulating that he is working in the archimedean thread .",
    "the second implicit assumption is that the weierstrassian notion of limit is central in cauchy .",
    "thus , boyer @xcite postulates that cauchy is working with a notion of limit similar to the weierstrassian one .",
    "this requires further argument , and at least at first glance is incorrect : cauchy emphasizes infinitesimals as a foundational notion , but he never emphasizes limits as a foundational notion .",
    "thus , in cauchy s definition of continuity the word  limit \" does occur , but only in the sense of the  endpoint \" of the interval of definition of the function , rather than the behavior of its values .. ]    \\2 .",
    "_ cauchy , along with other mathematicians , abandoned infinitesimals in favor of other more rigorous notions . _    during the period 1814 - 1820 , cauchy appears to have been ambivalent about infinitesimals . starting in about 1821",
    ", he uses them with increasing frequency both in his textbooks and his research publications , and insists on the centrality of infinitesimals as a foundational notion ; see section  [ time ] for a related chronology .",
    "_ cauchy was forced to teach infinitesimals at the ecole .",
    "_    the intended implication appears to be that cauchy only used infinitesimals because of the pressure from the ecole administration . during the period 1814 - 1820",
    "there were some tensions with the administration over the delayed appearance of infinitesimals in the syllabus , see @xcite . at any rate",
    ", cauchy continued using infinitesimals thoughout his career and long after completing his teaching stint at the ecole in 1830 .",
    "thus he reproduces his 1821 definition of continuity ( in terms of infinitesimals ) as late as 1853 , in his text on the sum theorem @xcite , see subsection  [ micro1 ] .",
    "_ cauchy based his infinitesimals on the notion of limit . _",
    "this is an ambiguous claim , and essentially a play on words on the term  limit \" .",
    "the modern audience understands  limit \" as a weierstrassian epsilontic notion .",
    "if this is what is claimed , then the claim is false .",
    "as far as the kinetic notion of limit that cauchy does mention in discussing a variable quantity approaching a limit , it is conspicuously absent in cauchy s discussion of infinitesimals .",
    "thus , rather than infinitesimals being based on the notion of limit , it is the notion of a variable quantity that s primitive , and both infinitesimals and limits are defined in terms of it ( see subsection  [ gilain ] for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "note again that the term  limit \" does appear in cauchy s definition of continuity , but in an entirely different sense , namely endpoint of the interval where the function is defined.to elaborate , we will note that the purported opposition between infinitesimals and limits ( a frequently found claim in the literature ) is a conceptual error in its own right .",
    "the opposition is not between limits and infinitesimals .",
    "limits are present in both approaches . in the infinitesimal approach",
    ", limits can be defined in terms of the standard part function , and the latter in terms of limits .",
    "the true opposition is between infinitesimals , on the one hand , and epsilon - delta with its quantifier complications , on the other .",
    "the preoccupation with the word `` limit '' can be exposed as a purely linguistic one by the following thought experiment , based on pourciau s lucid analysis , see footnote  [ pourciau ] .",
    "imagine that newton had developed an `` ult '' notation for his ultimate ratios , e.g. ,  @xmath47 for the derivative , and  @xmath48 for the integral .",
    "post - weierstrassian historians would then perhaps be more moderate in their enthusiasm for the vague musings about limits ( incorrectly ) attributed to dalembert , see subsection  [ chapelle ] . ]",
    "cauchy introduced rigor into calculus that anticipates the rigor of weierstrass . _",
    "while cauchy certainly emphasizes rigor , postulating a continuity between cauchy s rigor and weierstrassian rigor is a methodological error .",
    ", concerning the two parallel strands for the development of analysis .",
    "] to cauchy , rigor meant abandoning the principle of the  generality of algebra \" as practiced by euler , lagrange , and others , and its replacement by geometry  and by infinitesimals .",
