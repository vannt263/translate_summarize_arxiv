    "is provided by an applied density gradient by imposing boundary conditions on the gradient of a `` tracer '' species at the two edges of the cell rather than by a constant external driving force as in related models@xcite .",
    "tracer particles diffuse through a solvent with a prescribed density of `` crowder '' particles .",
    "our model demonstrates that the resulting tracer flux and crowder microstructure both depend sensitively on crowder density , interaction strength , and temperature .",
