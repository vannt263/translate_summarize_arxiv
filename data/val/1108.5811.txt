    "defect engineering is a powerful approach to generate nano - materials with plenty of novel properties@xcite .",
    "for instance , the defect induced magnetism in graphene was predicted@xcite , and a patterned defect can be used to open up a band gap in graphene by breaking the sublattice symmetry of the honeycomb structure@xcite .",
    "the defects formation in graphene can be observed directly by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( tem)@xcite .",
    "the formation and annealing of stone - wales and other defects were observed by transmission electron aberration - corrected microscope monochromated ( team 0.5 ) within 1   resolution at an acceleration voltage of only 80 kv that is low enough to protect graphene samples from being destroyed@xcite .",
    "these techniques for observation of defects in atomic - scale serve as a fundamental support for the nanoengineering of defects in graphene .",
    "the engineering of defects on the two - dimensional graphene sheet has been proposed theoretically in 2008 by lusk _",
    "_ using first - principle calculations@xcite .",
    "new carbon allotropes can be fabricated by periodically arrangement of basic defect building blocks such as stone - wales defects , inverse stone - wales defects , vacancy defects , and etc@xcite .",
    "the inverse stone - thrower - wales defect was also suggested as a building block for monolithic nanoengineering on graphene@xcite .",
    "quite recently , a one - dimensional topological defect in graphene is realized in the experiment@xcite .",
    "this extended defect exhibits similar property as a metallic wire and may form building blocks for various one - dimensional nano devices . in present paper , we will focus on the vacancy defect and substitutional si defect in graphene nanoribbon .    in the quasi - one - dimensional nanoribbon structure ,",
    "the two edges undergo a reconstruction and play an important role in determining many properties@xcite .",
    "the team 0.5 design was implemented to observe the edge reconstruction and capture the complex behavior of a atom at the edge of the graphene nanoribbon@xcite . as the edge region of a nanoribbon has very different properties from the inner region , an edge defect should behavior quite differently from a defect inner the nanoribbon .",
    "particularly , we are interested in how the edge and inner point defects behavior distinctly on the phonon thermal conductance in the graphene nanoribbon .",
    "the thermal transport capability is important in many functional nano devices .",
    "high thermal conductivity is a key property for high performance electronic devices , while extremely low thermal conductivity is crucial for thermoelectric materials . for graphene sheet",
    ", a high thermal conductivity was discovered experimentally@xcite .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been applied to study the thermal transport in graphene system .",
    "the direct non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation can be used to mimic the experimental conditions to study the thermal transport in graphene@xcite .",
    "the bolzmann equation method is suitable for the study of the diffusive thermal transport . the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach@xcite and a molecular dynamics simulation with quantum heat baths@xcite are both proper methods for the study of quantum thermal conductance . in our calculation",
    ", we apply the negf approach .    in this paper , we study the phonon thermal conductance in graphene nanoribbon by using the negf approach combined with the first - principle calculation .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculation gives a force constant matrix with long - range interaction while the negf approach requires first - nearest - neighboring ( fnn ) interaction in the calculation of the surface green s function .",
    "this conflict may be improved by using an enlarged unit cell .",
    "however , the enlargement of unit cell distinctly increases the simulation cost , which is even worse in _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "we thus propose an efficient correction to the force constant matrix to effectively renormalize the long - range interaction components into the fnn part .",
    "we then investigate vacancy and si point defects in the nanoribbon .",
    "the position of the vacancy defect plays an important role .",
    "an edge vacancy defect results in a further reconstruction of the edge of the nanoribbon thus only slightly affects the thermal conductance .",
    "the inner vacancy defect causes the defective area to become saddle - shaped , which considerably reduces the thermal conductance .",
    "all phonon modes are strongly scattered by this saddle - like surface in the nanoribbon . in the case of si defect , the thermal conductance shows no difference for edge or inner point defects .",
    "we also study phonon modes in the nanoribbon and find that there are some phonon modes localized at the edge of the nanoribbon .",
    "the number of edge modes is determined by the number of c - c bonds at the edge of the nanoribbon .",
    "these edge modes are of much higher frequency , since the edge c - c bonds are shorter and stronger after reconstruction during structure relaxation .",
    "the edge vacancy or si defects cause a significant downshift of a particular edge mode localized around this defective area .",
    "in this section , we concentrate on the combination of the negf approach and the first - principle calculation .",
    "this is nontrivial , because the first - principle calculation gives a force constant matrix with long - range interaction , while what the negf requires is a force constant matrix of fnn interaction .",
    "we have to take care of the conflict between the long - range and fnn characters .    in the _ ab initio _",
    "calculation , we use the siesta package@xcite to optimize the structure of the graphene nanoribbon and extract the force constant matrix .",
    "the local density approximation is applied to account for the exchange - correlation function with ceperley - alder parametrization@xcite and the double-@xmath0 basis set orbital ( dz ) is adopted . during the conjugate - gradients optimization of the nanoribbon , the maximum force on each atom is smaller than 0.01 ev /  . a mesh cut off of 320 ry is used .",
    "periodic boundary condition is applied in the heat transport direction , while the nanoribbon is free in the two vertical directions by introducing large vacancy space .",
    "we employ gamma point @xmath1 sampling in the periodic direction .    as discussed in previous works@xcite , the original force constant matrix @xmath2 from siesta",
    "violates the rigid translational symmetry ( rts ) and rigid rotational symmetry for the lattice structure .",
    "rts is the origin of the zero frequency for three acoustic phonon modes at @xmath3 point , while the rigid rotational symmetry is the root for the zero frequency rotational phonon modes in cylinder - like structures such as carbon nanotubes . in the planar graphene sheet",
    ", it is important to ensure that the force constant matrix satisfies the rts , so that the three acoustic phonon modes have zero frequency .",
    "the rts can be enforced by a renormalization of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "we refer to this new force constant matrix as @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 matrix can be written into following explicit form : @xmath5 where we have used labels l / c / r to denote three different regions : left lead , center , and right lead .",
    "the division of a whole system into three different regions is conventional in negf approach@xcite .",
    "the two matrices at the right top and left bottom corners are resulting from the periodic boundary condition in the heat transport direction . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are coupling between leads and center .",
    "the force constant matrix for left / right leads have been written in a periodic form , since the leads are the repetetion of the smallest unit cell .",
    "the dimension of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the total degree of freedom in the unit cell .",
    "@xmath8 is the force constant matrix for each unit cell and @xmath9 is the coupling between two neighboring unit cells .",
    "essentially , they are used to reconstruct the force constant matrix of the leads in the negf scheme : @xmath11 we show the result of left lead and the right lead is analogous .",
    "the most important physical quantity in the negf approach is the surface green s function of the lead , which is determined by the @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12 is a semi - infinite matrix as the lead is semi - infinite . as a result , it is impossible to calculate the surface green s function from an inverse of the force constant matirx by the expression @xmath13^{-1}$ ] . an efficient iterative method has been developed by sancho et al to solve the surface green s function numerically@xcite .",
    "this approach takes the advantage of the periodicity of the lead .",
    "it also requires that each unit cell only interacts with its two fnn unit cells .",
    "we refer to this requirement as the fnn property of the negf approach .",
    "after obtaining the @xmath14 , the retarded green s function for the center region can be calculated by :    [ 1.0 ]    @xmath15^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the self - energy for the lead is @xmath16 the transmission for phonon is given by the caroli formula : @xmath17 & = & tr\\left(g^{r}\\gamma_{l}g^{a}\\gamma_{r}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the advanced green s function and @xmath19 .",
    "finally , the phonon thermal conductance can be obtained by landau formula : @xmath20\\left[\\frac{\\partial n(\\omega , t)}{\\partial t}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we keep track of the rts in the whole negf scheme as shown above .",
    "overall , there are two direct consequences from the rts .",
    "firstly , the diagonalization of @xmath4 should give three zero - frequency acoustic phonon modes .",
    "secondly , corresponding to these three modes , the transmission function from negf should be 3 at @xmath21 , i.e @xmath22=3 $ ] . in the above , as the @xmath4 matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq_k ] ) satisfies the rts , we can correctly achieve zero frequency for the three acoustic phonon modes .",
    "so the first consequence of the rts is obtained .",
    "[ 1.0 ]    we now check the second consequence . as can be seen from the first line of @xmath4 , the rts results in following relation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a unit row vector with dimension as the total degree of freedom in unit cell .",
    "@xmath25 corresponds to the long - range interaction beyond the fnn .",
    "the nonzero @xmath25 is important to keep the whole @xmath4 matrix satisfying rts .",
    "because of @xmath26 , it can be seen from the first line of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_kl ] ) that rts has been broken in the lead , as @xmath27 .",
    "it leads to @xmath22\\not=3 $ ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_trans_correction ] by the solid line ( blue online ) .",
    "this is the conflict between the long - range character of the first - principle calculation and the fnn property of the negf .",
    "a straightforward technique to improve this conflict is to enlarge the unit cell of the leads to obtain smaller value of @xmath25@xcite .",
    "one can get @xmath28 for large enough unit cell .",
    "however , larger unit cell leads to the increase of the size of whole system , thus the calculation cost is increased and even more difficult in the first - principle calculation@xcite .",
    "another possible way to solve the conflict is doing correction to @xmath4 matrix , while the unit cell kept unchanged .",
    "there is no increase of calculation cost in this method since the size of the unit cell is the same .",
    "we can use the smallest unit cell in the nanoribbon as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cfg ]  ( a ) .",
    "this correction is realized in following two steps .",
    "( a ) . as discussed above",
    ", we enforce the rts to the force constant matrix .",
    "this will give us the @xmath4 matrix with translational symmetry fulfilled .",
    "we stress that @xmath4 has a nonzero matrix @xmath25 .",
    "we set @xmath28 in @xmath4 matrix , resulting in a new force constant matrix @xmath29 .",
    "the transmisstion function at @xmath21 from negf approach v.s correction steps.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    obviously , @xmath29 from step ( b ) violates the rts .",
    "we need to go back to step ( a ) to enforce rts to @xmath29 matrix and will obtain a new force constant matrix @xmath4 , which satisfies the rts and has a new nonzero @xmath25 . this nonzero matrix @xmath25 is smaller than the original one .",
    "after many cycles of these two steps , we obtain a force constant matrix @xmath4 with rts fulfilled and @xmath30 .",
    "so the fnn property of the negf can also be satisfied .",
    "essentially , the long - range component , @xmath25 , is renormalized into the fnn part by the correction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_trans_correction ] by dot line ( green online ) , after 20 cycles of steps ( a ) and ( b ) , the transmission function from negf gives a correct result , i.e @xmath22\\approx 3 $ ] .",
    "the correction has a nice property that it only affects the low - frequency region of the transmission function , indicating that the rts is enforced without affecting higher frequency region .",
    "the convergence of this correction is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_correction_step ] .",
    "it shows that after 10 cycles , zero frequency is achieved for the three acoustic phonon modes from @xmath4 and the @xmath22\\approx 3 $ ] from negf approach .",
    "the correction to the @xmath4 matrix can successfully combine the long - range siesta with the fnn negf sheme .    before continuation of further numerical calculation , we give a brief summation for this part .",
    "we are discussing the conflict between the long - range character of siesta and the fnn property of negf .",
    "the conflict is explicitly manifested by the rts in the graphene nanoribbon .",
