    "in previous papers of this series , we have constructed models of universe with a generalized equation of state @xmath15 having a linear component and a polytropic component . in papers",
    "i and ii , we have assumed @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath17 . in that case , the density decreases as the universe expands . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the polytropic component dominates the linear component when the density is high : this describes the early universe ( paper i ) . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the polytropic component dominates the linear component when the density is low : this describes the late universe ( paper ii ) .",
    "when the polytropic pressure is positive ( @xmath8 ) , the solutions of the friedmann equations exhibit past or future singularities ( or peculiarities ) .",
    "when the polytropic pressure is negative ( @xmath9 ) , there is no singularity .",
    "furthermore , the polytropic equation of state implies the existence of an upper bound @xmath20 ( in the past ) and a lower bound @xmath21 ( in the future ) for the density .",
    "it makes sense to identify the maximum density to the planck density @xmath22 and the minimum density to the cosmological density @xmath23 .",
    "these constant densities imply in turn the existence of two phases of exponential inflation , one in the early universe and one in the late universe . during the inflation ,",
    "the universe is accelerating .",
    "the early inflation is necessary to solve notorious difficulties such as the singularity problem , the flatness problem , and the horizon problem @xcite .",
    "the late inflation is necessary to account for the observed accelerating expansion of our universe @xcite driven by dark energy @xcite . in that context",
    ", the equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) with @xmath9 and @xmath19 corresponds to the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite that has been proposed as a model for dark energy . from the generalized polytropic equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) ,",
    "we have obtained a model of universe without singularity that possesses striking `` symmetries '' between the past and the future ( aioniotic universe ) .",
    "this model , which could have been obtained from a principle of `` simplicity '' without making any observation , turns out to be strikingly consistent with what we know of the real universe .",
    "it is consistent with the standard model @xcite but refines it by removing the primordial singularity ( big bang ) . in this model ,",
    "the planck density and the cosmological density are interpreted as two _ fundamental _ bounds for the density determined by the planck constant @xmath24 ( microphysics ) and the cosmological constant @xmath25 ( cosmophysics ) , respectively .",
    "these bounds differ by @xmath26 orders of magnitudes , a difference that appears to be quite natural instead of representing a `` problem '' @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a case that has not been treated in our previous papers .",
    "this is the case where the density increases as the universe expands .",
    "since the nature of dark energy is unknown , this situation can not be rejected _",
    "a priori_. it corresponds to an equation of state parameter @xmath27 less than @xmath28 which violates the null dominant energy condition .",
    "this is referred to as a `` phantom universe '' @xcite because when the equation of state with @xmath29 is constructed in terms of a scalar field , the corresponding kinetic term has the wrong sign ( negative kinetic energy ) .",
    "it represents therefore a phantom ( ghost ) scalar field ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "actually , there is a rich recent literature on this situation ( more than one thousand papers are related to phantom dark energy ) since observations do not exclude the possibility that we live in a phantom universe . indeed , observational data indicate that the equation of state parameter @xmath27 lies in a narrow strip around @xmath30 possibly being below this value @xcite .",
    "the models based on phantom dark energy usually predict a future singularity in which the scale factor , the energy density , and the pressure of the universe become infinite in a finite time .",
    "this would lead to the death of the universe in a singularity called `` big smash '' @xcite , `` big rip '' or `` cosmic doomsday '' @xcite .",
    "contrary to the `` big crunch '' , the universe is destroyed not by excessive contraction but rather by excessive expansion . in phantom cosmology ,",
    "every gravitationally bound system ( _ e.g. _ the solar system , the milky way , the local group , galaxy clusters ) is dissociated before the singularity @xcite , and the black holes gradually lose their mass and finally vanish @xcite .",
    "this scenario allows the explicit calculation of the rest of the lifetime of our universe . actually ,",
    "as we approach the singularity , the energy scale may grow up to the planck one , giving rise to a second quantum gravity era .",
    "eventually , quantum effects may moderate or even prevent the singularity @xcite .",
    "other aspects of phantom cosmology have been studied in @xcite .",
    "there are many interesting recent works on the study of singularities .",
    "in particular , nojiri _",
    "@xcite considered an equation of state of the form @xmath31 and obtained a classification of finite - time future singularities ( see complements in @xcite ) .",
    "they are of four types :    @xmath32 type 0 ( big bang or big crunch ) : for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath32 type i ( big rip ) : for @xmath33 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",

    "are all finite constants ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "type 0 is the standard big bang or big crunch singularity arising in the original friedmann models @xcite .",
    "type i is the big rip singularity which emerges from the phantom equation of state @xmath1 with constant @xmath47 @xcite , and from the equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) with @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "type ii corresponds to the sudden future singularity found by barrow @xcite at which @xmath49 and @xmath50 are finite but @xmath51 diverges .",
    "type iii , arising in the equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) with @xmath18 @xcite differs from the sudden future singularity in the sense that @xmath50 diverges .",
    "type iv appears in the model described in @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the phantom models with @xmath29 do not necessarily lead to future singularities .",
    "for example , the equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) with @xmath6 and @xmath52 does not present future singularity @xcite .",
    "however , since the scale factor and the density increase indefinitely , this has been called `` little rip '' @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the models with @xmath53 may lead to past or future singularities .",
    "for example , the new form of primordial singularity ( for @xmath18 and @xmath8 ) described in secs .",
    "iv c , vi and in appendix a of paper i corresponds to a past singularity of type iii : the universe starts at @xmath14 with a finite scale factor and an infinite density . on the other hand",
    ", the future singularity ( for @xmath54 and @xmath8 ) described in sec .",
    "iv c and in appendix b of paper ii corresponds to a singularity of type ii : at a finite time @xmath42 , the universe reaches a point at which the scale factor is finite , the density vanishes and the pressure is infinite .    in paper ii , we have also introduced a notion of `` peculiarity '' .",
    "this is when the density vanishes @xmath55 while the scale factor has a finite value @xmath43 ( when @xmath56 we shall call it generalized peculiarity ) . in that case , the universe is empty ( in other works , it `` disappears '' ) .",
    "although there is no singularity , this situation is very peculiar .",
    "however , since the nature of dark energy is unknown , all possibilities should be contemplated .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an exhaustive study of the equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) in the case @xmath12 ( requiring @xmath9 ) for arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath57 .",
    "this is a natural continuation of our previous works which assumed @xmath58 ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "our paper also completes previous studies of the case @xmath58 that considered @xmath6 @xcite or @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "an interesting result of our study is that the equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) with @xmath11 does _ not _ present a big rip singularity although @xmath29 , contrary to the linear equation of state @xmath1 with @xmath47 @xcite or the equation of state ( [ intro1 ] ) with @xmath6 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "another interesting result of our study is the construction of a bouncing phantom universe for @xmath59 . for @xmath54 ,",
    "this bouncing universe presents a past singularity of type ii : at @xmath14 , the the pressure is infinite while the scale factor has a finite value and the density vanishes . for @xmath11 and @xmath13",
    ", corresponding to a constant negative pressure , the bouncing phantom universe admits a simple analytical expression .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we also assume that the universe is flat in agreement with observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
