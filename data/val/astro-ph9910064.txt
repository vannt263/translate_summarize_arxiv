    "the active starburst is located in the center of the galaxy , and this region has consequently received intense observational scrutiny .",
    "all of the bright radio and infrared sources associated with the active starburst are confined within a radius of @xmath2 pc .",
    "most of this volume is heavily obscured by dust at optical wavelengths , although visible structures labeled m82 a , c , e , and f in the nomenclature of om78 , oconnell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and gallagher & smith ( 1999 ) probably represent lower extinction parts of the outer starburst .",
    "the optical energy distributions of regions a and c indicate the presence of massive ionizing stars with ages of @xmath8 myr ( om78 , marcum & oconnell 1996 ) , in agreement with ages based on infrared photometry for the higher extinction region of the starburst core ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
    "1993 , satyapal et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "however , ample evidence exists that this is not the only major starburst episode to have occurred in m82 .",
    "the high surface brightness region m82 b , lying 5001000 pc ne from the galactic center , has exactly the properties one would predict for a post - starburst region in which an older starburst occurred with an amplitude similar to that of the active burst .",
    "region b has an a - type absorption - line spectrum dominated by strong balmer lines and lacks significant emission lines .",
    "spectral synthesis ( om78 , marcum & oconnell 1996 ) implies a sharp main - sequence cut - off corresponding to an age of @xmath9 100200 myr .",
    "gallagher & smith ( 1999 ) recently obtained an age of @xmath9 60 myr for the very luminous ( @xmath10 ) cluster f , located 440 pc sw of the galaxy s center .",
    "this suggests that active star formation has been propagating through the disk of m82 during the last @xmath11 myr .    the present - day starburst core of m82",
    "is well known to contain a large population of compact supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "these are obscured at optical wavelengths by large line - of - sight extinction by dust , but their structures and evolution have been studied at radio wavelengths ( e.g. , kronberg 1985 , huang et al .",
    "1994 , muxlow et al .",
    "1994 , allen & kronberg 1998 ) .",
    "heretofore , no snrs have been detected at visible wavelengths in m82 . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of ten snr candidates in the `` fossil '' starburst region m82 b , based on narrow - band h@xmath0 observations obtained with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , and compare their properties to those of known snrs in other star - forming galaxies .",
    "to supplement an ongoing broad - band imaging program on super star clusters in m82 b with the _ hst / wfpc2 _ and _ hst / nicmos _ cameras , we extracted from the _ hst _ archive h@xmath0+continuum observations of the central regions of m82 , taken through the f656n narrow - band filter ( march 16 , 1997 , program go # 6826 ; and september 12 , 1995 , go # 5957 ) .",
    "these consisted of pairs of 500s and 300s exposures , respectively .",
    "we combined the exposures to eliminate cosmic rays using the iraf / stsdas tasks mkdark and cosmicrays . from these , we used idl ) is a registered trademark of research systems , inc . ] to create an h@xmath0+continuum mosaic of the central regions of m82 and co - registered this with our own broad - band _ hst / wfpc2 _ images in _ v _",
    "( f555w ) and _ i _ ( f814w ) . details of the latter observations ( go # 7446 ) will be discussed in de grijs , oconnell , & gallagher ( 1999 ) .",
    "since we lacked a suitable narrow - band continuum image near the bandpass of the f656n filter , we created a pseudo - continuum image from our co - registered ( and essentially emission - line - free ) _ v _ and _ i_-band _ wfpc2 _ images , by linearly interpolating the continuum fluxes to the mean wavelength of the f656n filter .",
    "we subtracted the pseudo - continuum image thus constructed from the h@xmath0+continuum image to obtain an image containing pure line emission ( the passband of the f656n filter is sufficiently narrow not to require an [ nii ] correction ) .    figure [ fig1.fig ] shows the regions of interest here on a ground - based _",
    "b_-band image of m82 .",
    "regions a and c are parts of the starburst core and lie at the base of the minor - axis h@xmath0 plume , which is not visible in this continuum image ( om78 ) .",
    "the peak of the 2.2@xmath12 continuum emission from the starburst core , often called the `` ir nucleus , '' lies 2  west of the center of m82 a ( dietz et al . 1986 , oconnell et al . 1995 ) .",
    "region b lies northeast of a and c , separated from them by the strong central dust lane in the galaxy .",
    "the box in the image shows the area of m82 b which was imaged with _",
    "hst _ in continuum bands by de grijs et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . because there is a gradient of properties within region b ,",
    "we have divided it into two subregions : b1 and b2 .",
    "the boundary between regions b1 and b2 is ra(j2000 ) = @xmath13 , with b1 lying to the east of this line .",
    "we based our flux calibrations on the procedures for _ wfpc2 _ data recommended by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in order to check the quality of the resulting calibration",
    ", we compared the total h@xmath0 fluxes from the bright regions a and c ( om78 ) in the _ wfpc2 _ images to those obtained with 58 circular aperture , ground - based spectrophotometry by om78 .",
    "aperture photometry of our images revealed the ground - based h@xmath0 values to be @xmath14% brighter than in the nominal _",
    "wfpc2 _ calibration .",
    "considering the various uncertainties , especially aperture centering errors and our use of an interpolated continuum for correction of the _ hst _ emission line data , this is good agreement .",
    "we will adopt the ground - based zero point for the h@xmath0 fluxes discussed in the remainder of this paper .    in the subsequent analysis",
    ", we adopt a distance for m82 of 3.6 mpc or a distance modulus of @xmath15 mag , based on the cepheid distance for m81 obtained by freedman et al .",
    "the _ hst _ pure - h@xmath0 images as well as ground - based images ( e.g. , lynds & sandage 1963 , mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 ) show that there is relatively little line emission in the disk of m82 at radii larger than 500 pc from the central starburst .",
    "the easily visible h@xmath0 is concentrated to the core starburst region and the bright minor - axis plume extending from it , perpendicular to the galaxy s disk .",
    "our continuum - subtracted pure - h@xmath0 image of region b is shown in figure [ fig2.fig]a .",
    "there is diffuse h@xmath0 emission here , but at much lower levels than in regions a and c and in the bright plume .",
    "for a quantitative comparison , we integrated the h@xmath0 flux in our subtracted image over @xmath16 apertures centered on regions a , b1 , and b2 .",
    "total h@xmath0 luminosities were @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath0 surface brightness declines with distance from the galaxy s center .",
    "figure [ fig2.fig]b shows the same field as fig . [ fig2.fig]a in the continuum _",
    "a bright diffuse stellar background is present , and several dozen individual compact star clusters are visible .",
    "( the clusters are discussed further in de grijs et al . 1999 . )",
    "there is clearly not a one - to - one correspondence between the clusters and the bright emission line regions .",
    "many clusters have little or no h@xmath0 emission , and some h@xmath0 emission regions have inconspicuous continuum counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig2.fig]a shows that region b1 has few compact h@xmath0 sources . however , b2 , located closer to the active starburst core , is brighter in h@xmath0 , due to both compact sources and diffuse emission , although still at a surface brightness @xmath20 lower than in the active starburst .",
    "we used the find routine in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) to identify compact sources on both the emission line and continuum images .",
    "we measured net fluxes for these using circular apertures with radii in the range 3 - 7.5 pixels ( 030  075 ) , adjusted depending on the structure and brightness of the local background .",
    "we obtained h@xmath0 fluxes and equivalent widths ( ews ) for , respectively , 37 and 50 compact optical continuum sources in b1 and b2 ( cf .",
    "de grijs et al .",
    "1999 ) , of which only 9 and 16 , respectively , contain significant h@xmath0 emission .",
    "positive h@xmath0 detections are listed in table [ halpha.tab ] .",
    "most of the identified h@xmath0 sources in b2 have h@xmath0 brightnesses significantly above the norm for the exterior regions of the galaxy , especially considering the excess extinction in b2 ( estimated to have @xmath21 mag higher than b1 , de grijs et al .",
    "the brightest object in b2 resolves to a `` string of pearls '' of discrete sources and is conspicuously located adjacent to the strong central dust lane which separates region b from the starburst core .",
    "in addition to h@xmath0 associated with definite , compact continuum sources , we found 11 h@xmath0 compact sources in region b2 with only faint counterparts in the continuum passbands .",
    "we measured fluxes for these as above .",
    "net continuum fluxes were positive , if small , in all cases , yielding equivalent widths of 50   or higher .",
    "these sources are listed in table [ halpha.tab ] with asterisks .",
    "the quoted errors for the ews include the estimated statistical uncertainties in the continuum measures .",
    "one expects to find two types of compact h@xmath0 sources in a galaxy like m82 .",
    "hii regions will exist around young star clusters with ages @xmath22 myr by virtue of the presence of ionizing o- or early b - type stars .",
    "although very young hii regions can have substantial h@xmath0 ews in the range 100 - 1000   ( e.g. , bresolin & kennicutt 1997 ) , there should always be a significant continuum source associated with these , even if there is considerable extinction in the vicinity .",
    "type ii supernovae ( sne ) can also produce compact h@xmath0 remnants .",
    "these will often be associated with their parent star clusters , but in many cases there may be no well - defined compact continuum source . since type ii sne can occur up to 50 myr after a star formation event , the associated cluster may have faded or dynamically expanded enough to be inconspicuous against the bright background of the galaxy . alternatively , the parent star of the snr could have been ejected from the cluster or could have formed initially in the lower density field .",
    "earlier studies of resolved starbursts suggest that 80 - 90% of the bright stellar population resides in a diffuse component outside of compact clusters ( e.g. , meurer et al . 1995 , oconnell et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the identified m82 b h@xmath0 sources fall into two wide luminosity ranges : those with @xmath23 and those with @xmath24 .",
    "neither group has the properties expected for normal hii regions in the disk of a late - type galaxy .",
    "recent samples of normal hii regions in spiral and irregular galaxies have been compiled by , among others , kennicutt , edgar & hodge ( 1989 ) , bresolin & kennicutt ( 1997 ) , and youngblood & hunter ( 1999 ) .",
    "the brightest h@xmath0 source in m82 b has @xmath25 .",
    "although normal galaxies contain many hii regions with luminosities in this range , they invariably also have much brighter sources , with luminosities up to 10@xmath26 .",
    "the largest m82 b source is smaller than 20 pc in diameter , whereas typical diameters for normal disk hii regions are 30100 pc .",
    "instead , we believe that the 10 sources in the more luminous group are good candidates for snrs . these are listed in the upper part of table [ halpha.tab ] .",
    "six of these have only faint counterparts in the continuum passbands . some of the sources ( e.g. , source # 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig2.fig]a ) show evidence of limb brightening , as might be expected for older supernova remnants .",
    "h@xmath0 observations of large numbers of snrs have recently become available for a number of nearby galaxies . in this section ,",
    "we compare the properties of our m82 candidate snrs to those of this larger sample .",
    "we consider h@xmath0 luminosities , sizes , and surface brightnesses .",
    "figure [ fig3.fig ] shows that the h@xmath0 luminosities of the snr candidates in m82 b ( uncorrected for either foreground or internal extinction ) are consistent with those of the main populations of snrs in similar galaxies . in this figure , we have collected the h@xmath0 luminosities of snrs in three late - type galaxies ( identified in the figure legend ) as well as for m81 , the luminous sb - type neighbor of m82 .",
    "the m82 values fall at the low end of the plotted range , overlapping with the snrs in ngc 300 and m81 . however , a correction for the obvious , if not well determined , internal extinction in region b ( probably a factor of @xmath27 at 6500  ) would produce better agreement with the mean of the distribution . although we have chosen these four comparison systems as most relevant to possible snrs in m82 , the luminosities plotted are typical of the complete sample of snrs known in nearby galaxies including m31 , m33 , m101 , and the large magellanic cloud ( long et al .",
    "1990 , braun & walterbos 1993 , yang , skillman & sramek 1994 , matonick & fesen 1997 , gordon et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a comparison of the physical full - width - half - maxima ( fwhm ) of our snr candidates ( see table [ halpha.tab ] ) with those of the h@xmath0 emission in the comparison samples reveals that the m82 sources are relatively small , with sizes averaging 10 pc compared to values of over 50 pc in typical spiral galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4.fig ] ) .",
    "the m82 b candidates are , however , larger than the bonafide snr sources in the central starburst of m82 , which have radio continuum diameters in the range 15 pc .",
    "we return to the question of the sizes of our candidates in  5 .",
    "surface brightness - diameter ( @xmath1 ) relations in the radio continuum have formed the basis of many snr studies ; they were first discussed for galactic radio snrs by woltjer ( 1972 ) and clark & caswell ( 1976 ) . at radio wavelengths , the @xmath1 relations for the galaxy , the lmc and other galaxies , including m82 ( berkhuijsen 1986 , huang et al .",
    "1994 , muxlow et al .",
    "1994 ) , superpose sufficiently well to construct a composite @xmath1 relation with relatively small scatter for all known shell radio snrs ( e.g. , milne , caswell & haynes 1980 , berkhuijsen 1983 , 1986 , green 1984 , case & bhattacharya 1998 ) .",
    "@xmath1 relations in h@xmath0 have been discussed before only in the context of the young snrs in m33 ( long et al .",
    "1990 , gordon et al .",
    "1998 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig4.fig ] , we plot the h@xmath0 surface brightnesses and diameters for the candidate m82 snrs and a composite comparison sample .",
    "surface brightnesses ( @xmath28 ) are computed in units of erg s@xmath7 @xmath29 arcsec@xmath30 and are tabulated for our candidates in table 1 .",
    "the comparison sample includes the same systems shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3.fig ] .",
    "figure [ fig4.fig ] shows that a broad h@xmath0 @xmath31 relation exists for snrs in normal late - type galaxies .",
    "although the h@xmath0 surface brightnesses of the m82 candidates are generally high , and the diameters small , they fall on the same ( @xmath1 ) relation as do the normal snr samples .",
    "this is additional evidence supporting the interpretation of the m82 candidates as snrs .",
    "high - resolution vla observations at 8.4 ghz of the m82 central regions were obtained by huang et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , with a total integration time of 20 minutes , of which the appropriate section covering m82 b was kindly made available to us by j. condon .",
    "none of the h@xmath0-bright snr candidates , with the possible exception of source # 2 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig2.fig]a ) , appear to show 8.4 ghz radio emission brighter than @xmath32jy associated with them .",
    "however , the `` string of pearls '' of bright , discrete h@xmath0 sources in the southwestern corner of our field seems to be an extension of a similar string of bright 8.4 ghz sources lying behind the strong dust lane just outside our h@xmath0 field of view which crosses the galaxy near this position ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1.fig ] ) .",
    "likewise , most of the bright 8.4 ghz sources in region b2 are located in areas with higher than average extinction , where detection of optical or h@xmath0 counterparts would be difficult .",
    "deeper imaging at radio wavelengths may result in positive detections at lower radio continuum flux limits ; due to the steep spectral index of snrs , imaging at lower frequencies would be preferable .",
    "it is not unusual for snrs to be h@xmath0 bright while lacking significant emission at radio wavelengths . from a theoretical point of view , radio and h@xmath0 emission",
    "are due to different physical processes and are prominent at different evolutionary stages of the snr .",
    "radio emission arises earlier in snr evolution than does h@xmath0 emission .",
    "m31 ( braun & walterbos 1993 ) and m33 ( gordon et al . 1998 ) are the only galaxies in which optically - selected snrs have been studied in detail at radio wavelengths . of the @xmath33",
    "optically - selected snrs and snr candidates in m31 and m33 , about 40% are not detected above @xmath34jy .",
    "fluxes from similar snrs in m82 would be expected to be about 10 times fainter than the m31 and m33 cases , so the absence of such radio emission from the m82 b candidates does not appear to be unusual .",
    "by contrast , the brightness of the snrs in the m82 starburst core ( cf .",
    "huang et al . 1994 ) may be a product of an abnormally dense interstellar medium .",
    "strong h@xmath0 emission from an snr ordinarily implies that it is in a radiative evolutionary state .",
    "h@xmath0 is observed from nonradiative remnants , such as tycho s remnant , but the emission is weak .",
    "assuming evolution in a constant density interstellar medium , the radiative state at a particular radius implies a lower limit for the ambient density .",
    "cioffi , mckee , & bertschinger ( 1988 ) give expressions for the radius and velocity at which the radiative pds ( pressure - driven snowplow ) phase begins : @xmath35 pc and @xmath36 km s@xmath7 , where @xmath37 is the supernova energy in units of @xmath38 ergs and @xmath39 is the hydrogen density in units of 10 @xmath40 .",
    "these expressions assume solar metallicity , which is appropriate for m82 ( om78 ) . given the smallest diameter of 5.5 pc and taking a standard sn energy , @xmath41 , the minimum density is 44 @xmath40 .",
    "the shock velocity in such a remnant is 710 km s@xmath7 at the time of shell formation .",
    "the required density is not unusual for a dense cloud , especially in an active star formation region .",
    "an alternative to interstellar interaction is interaction with pre - supernova mass loss .",
    "the expectation for the snrs in m82 b is that their progenitors are at the low mass end of type ii sn progenitors and thus are approximately b1 to b3 stars when on the main sequence .",
    "these stars are too cool to have strong winds .",
    "they may have slow , dense winds as red supergiant stars , but at the radii of interest here , the density is not expected to be sufficiently high to sustain a radiative shock front .",
    "interstellar interaction is the more likely situation",
    ".    models of radiative shock waves show that the h@xmath0 intensity is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ambient density and @xmath44 is the shock velocity , if @xmath44 is in the approximate range 100200 km s@xmath7 and the shocked gas is pre - ionized ( raymond 1979 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath44 is probably weaker at higher shock velocities and may tend to @xmath45 .",
    "the expansion of a radiative remnant can be approximated by @xmath46 for a fixed explosion energy ( chevalier 1974 ; cioffi et al .",
    "1988 ) , where @xmath47 is the radius of the snr .",
    "the implied @xmath1 relation for h@xmath0 is then @xmath48 , perhaps tending to @xmath49 at high shock velocities . for a fixed density ,",
    "this relation is considerably steeper than the observed relation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4.fig ] .",
    "one reason for this may be observational selection : the observed sample may consist of snrs for a range of ambient density which have just become radiative and are therefore brightest .",
    "they subsequently fade from view and fall below the detection threshold .",
    "another reason may be that the expansion takes places in an inhomogeneous medium , and only a small part of the shell has become radiative for the apparently small remnants .",
    "the relation of these possible snrs to the smaller , nonthermal radio - emitting remnants in the center of m82 is unclear .",
    "the central remnants are not observed in optical line emission , so it is unknown whether they are in a radiative phase of evolution .",
    "these remnants probably have more massive stars as progenitors and so could have a complex mass loss environment .",
    "finally , the higher interstellar pressure in the center of m82 could lead to different evolutionary properties .",
    "the presence of snrs in the post - starburst region of m82 can help to set limits on its star formation history .",
    "the last sne in a quenched starburst region would occur at a time comparable to the longest lifetime of an sn progenitor after the end of the starburst activity . following iben & laughlin ( 1989 ) and hansen & kawaler ( 1994 ) , the time @xmath50 spent between the zero - age main sequence and planetary nebula phase by an @xmath51 progenitor star , which is generally adopted as a lower limit for type ii sne ( e.g. , kennicutt 1984 ) , corresponds to @xmath52 myr .",
    "type ia sne , which involve lower mass stars in binary systems , can occur much later , but one expects these to be more uniformly distributed over the galaxy s surface , not concentrated near regions of recent star formation .",
    "the radiative lifetimes of the shell snrs in their later phases are short in this context .",
    "they are limited by the expansion velocities of their shells .",
    "older snrs will be physically large and have low surface brightnesses .",
    "radio observations of well - studied galactic snrs indicate relatively rapid luminosity declines , causing the observable radiative snr lifetimes to be @xmath53 yr ( e.g. , braun , goss & lyne 1989 ; shull , fesen & saken 1989 ; matthews , wallace & taylor 1998 ) , at which time they will have attained diameters of order 50100 pc .    therefore , if our candidates are indeed snrs they suggest an upper limit to the end of the starburst event in region b2 of @xmath3 myr .",
    "the absence of snr candidates in b1 indicates it is older .",
    "the spectral synthesis dating of region b1 is consistent with this ( @xmath9 100200 myr , marcum & oconnell 1996 ) , as are the colors of the _ hst_-detected star clusters ( de grijs et al .",
    "there is then the following progression of ages with distance from the center of the current starburst : b1 ( @xmath54 100 myr , @xmath55 pc ) , b2 ( @xmath56 50 myr , @xmath57 pc ) , and the present core ( active for @xmath58 myr , @xmath59 pc ) .",
    "we have studied the h@xmath0 emission from the post - starburst region 5001000 pc ne of the center of m82 using _ hst / wfpc2 _ images .",
    "h@xmath0 emission in this region in general is far below levels associated with the current starburst core within @xmath2 pc from the galactic center .",
    "region b1 has little diffuse emission and few compact sources .",
    "region b2 , located closer to the core , has more of both .",
    "we find that the compact sources divide by h@xmath0 luminosity into two groups .",
    "the objects in the brighter group are good candidates for type ii supernova remnants .",
    "their h@xmath0 luminosities , surface brightnesses and sizes are consistent with those of snrs in other star - forming galaxies .",
    "we attribute their smaller sizes and higher surface brightnesses to a relatively higher local interstellar gas density ( @xmath60 ) than prevails in normal spiral disks .",
    "if these candidates are indeed snrs they indicate an upper limit to the end of the starburst event in region b2 of @xmath3 myr and suggest that intense star - forming activity in m82 has propagated inward toward the present starburst core during the past 100200 myr .    the evidence that our candidates are actually snrs is only circumstantial .",
    "although their properties seem to compare better to snr samples in other galaxies than to those of hii regions , they could be hii regions which have been affected by the unusual physical circumstances in m82 s disk .",
    "a straightforward test would be to obtain [ s ii]/h@xmath0 emission line ratios for the candidates , since these are sensitive to the presence of strong shock waves .",
