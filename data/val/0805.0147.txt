    "the greatest potential of the theory of chaos in partial differential equations lies in its abundant applications in science and engineering . the variety of the specific problems demands continuing innovation of the theory @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . in these representative publications ,",
    "two theories were developed .",
    "the theory developed in @xcite @xcite @xcite involves transversal homoclinic orbits , and shadowing technique is used to prove the existence of chaos .",
    "this theory is very complete .",
    "the theory in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite deals with silnikov homoclinic orbits , and geometric construction of smale horseshoes is employed .",
    "this theory is not very complete .",
    "the main machineries for locating homoclinic orbits are ( 1 ) .",
    "darboux transformations , ( 2 ) .",
    "isospectral theory , ( 3 ) .",
    "persistence of invariant manifolds and fenichel fibers , ( 4 ) .",
    "melnikov analysis and shooting technique .",
    "overall , the two theories on chaos in partial differential equations are results of combining integrable theory , dynamical system theory , and partial differential equations @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we are interested in the chaotic spin dynamics in a long nanomagnet diven by an electrical current .",
    "we hope that the abundant spin dynamics revealed by this study can generate experimental studies on long nanomagets .",
    "to illustrate the general significance of the spin dynamics , in particular the magnetization reversal issue , we use a daily example : the memory of the hard drive of a computer .",
    "the magnetization is polarized along the direction of the external magnetic field . by reversing the external magnetic field ,",
    "magnetization reversal can be accomplished ; thereby , generating @xmath0 and @xmath1 binary sequence and accomplishing memory purpose .",
    "memory capacity and speed via such a technique have reached their limits .",
    "the `` bit '' writing scheme based on such oersted - maxwell magnetic field ( generated by an electrical current ) encounters fundamental problem from classical electromagnetism : the long range magnetic field leads to unwanted writing or erasing of closely packed neighboring magnetic elements in the extremely high density memory device and the induction laws place an upper limit on the memory speed due to slow rise - and - decay - time imposed by the law of induction .",
    "discovered by slonczewski @xcite and berger @xcite , electrical current can directly apply a large torque to a ferromagnet .",
    "if electrical current can be directly applied to achieve magnetization reversal , such a technique will dramatically increase the memory capacity and speed of a hard drive .",
    "the magnetization can then be switched on the scale of nanoseconds and nanometers @xcite .",
    "the industrial value will be tremendous .",
    "nanomagnets driven by currents has been intensively studied recently @xcite .",
    "the researches have gone beyond the original spin valve system @xcite @xcite .",
    "for instance , current driven torques have been applied to magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite @xcite , dilute magnetic semiconductors @xcite , multi - magnet couplings @xcite @xcite .",
    "ac currents were also applied to generate spin torque @xcite @xcite .",
    "such ac current can be used to generate the external magnetic field @xcite or applied directly to generate spin torque @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the electrical current introduces a spin torque forcing term in the conventional landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation .",
    "the ac current can induce novel dynamics of the llg equation , like synchronization @xcite @xcite and chaos @xcite @xcite .",
    "both synchronization and chaos are important phenomena to understand before implementing the memory technology . in @xcite @xcite",
    ", we studied the dynamics of synchronization and chaos for the llg equation by ignoring the exchange field ( i.e. llg ordinary differential equations ) .",
    "when the nanomagnetic device has the same order of length along every direction , exchange field is not important , and we have a so - called single domain situation where the spin dynamics is governed by the llg ordinary differential equations . in this article , we will study what we call `` long nanomagnet '' which is much longer along one direction than other directions .",
    "in such a situation , the exchange field will be important .",
    "this leads to a llg partial differential equation .",
    "in fact , we will study the case where the exchange field plays a dominant role .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section 2 presents the mathematical formulation of the problem .",
    "section 3 is an integrable study on the heisenberg equation . based upon section 3 , section 4 builds the melnikov integral theory for predicting chaos . section 5 presents the numerical simulations . section 6 is an appendix to section 3 .",
    "to simplify the study , we will investigate the case that the magnetization depends on only one spatial variable , and has periodic boundary condition in this spatial variable .",
    "the application of this situation will be a large ring shape nanomagnet .",
    "thus , we shall study the following forced landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation in the dimensionless form , @xmath2 subject to the periodic boundary condition @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a unit magnetization vector @xmath5 in which the three components are along ( @xmath6 ) directions with unit vectors ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 , the effective magnetic field @xmath9 has several terms @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the exchange field , @xmath12 is the external field , @xmath13 is the demagnetization field , and @xmath14 is the anisotropy field . for the materials of the experimental interest , the dimensionless parameters are in the ranges @xmath15 \\ , \\quad { \\beta}_2 \\in [ 0.01 , 0.3]\\ ; \\label{pr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath16 is a small parameter measuring the length scale of the exchange field .",
    "one can also add an ac current effect in the external field @xmath17 , but the results on the dynamics are similar .    our goal is to build a melnikov function for the llg equation around domain walls .",
    "the roots of such a melnikov function provide a good indication of chaos .    for the rest of this section",
    ", we will introduce a few interesting notations .",
    "the pauli matrices are : @xmath18 let @xmath19 i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 thus , @xmath22 ( the identity matrix ) .",
    "let @xmath23 then the llg can be written in the form @xmath24 \\ , \\label{efor}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 = { \\gamma}\\pi - \\pi { \\gamma}$ ] .",
    "setting @xmath16 to zero , the llg ( [ llg ] ) reduces to the heisenberg ferromagnet equation , @xmath26 using the matrix @xmath27 introduced in ( [ gamma ] ) , the heisenberg equation ( [ he ] ) has the form @xmath28 \\ , \\label{phe}\\ ] ] where the bracket @xmath29 $ ] is defined in ( [ efor ] ) .",
    "obvious constants of motion of the heisenberg equation ( [ he ] ) are the hamiltonian , @xmath30 the momentum , @xmath31 and the total spin , @xmath32 the heisenberg equation ( [ he ] ) is an integrable system with the following lax pair , @xmath33 \\right ) \\psi \\ , \\label{lp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is complex - valued , @xmath35 is a complex parameter , @xmath27 is the matrix defined in ( [ gamma ] ) , and @xmath36 = { \\gamma}{\\gamma}_x - { \\gamma}_x { \\gamma}$ ] . in fact , there is a connection between the heisenberg equation ( [ he ] ) and the 1d integrable focusing cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation via a nontrivial gauge transformation .",
    "the details of this connection are given in the appendix .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the temporally periodic solutions of the nls equation correspond to the domain walls of the heisenberg equation .",
    "consider the domain wall @xmath37 which is a fixed point of the heisenberg equation .",
    "linearizing the heisenberg equation at this fixed point , one gets @xmath38 -\\frac{1}{2 }   [ { \\gamma } , { \\gamma}_{0xx } ] \\ .\\ ] ] let @xmath39 we get @xmath40 let @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants . we obtain that @xmath45 which shows that only the modes @xmath46 are unstable .",
    "such instability is called a modulational instability , also called a side - band instability . comparing the heisenberg ferromagnet equation ( [ he ] ) and the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( [ llg ] ) , we see that if we drop the exchange field @xmath11 in the effective magnetic field @xmath9 ( [ ef ] ) , such a modulational instability will disappear , and the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( [ llg ] ) reduces to a system of three ordinary differential equations , which has no chaos as verified numerically .",
    "thus the modulational instability is the source of the chaotic magnetization dynamics .    in terms of @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 choosing @xmath49 , we have for @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 , @xmath53 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the nonlinear foliation of the above linear modulational instability can be established via a darboux transformation .      a darboux transformation for ( [ lp1])-([lp2 ] ) can be obtained .",
    "let @xmath61 be a solution to the lax pair ( [ lp1])-([lp2 ] ) at ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "define the matrix @xmath63 where @xmath64 then if @xmath65 solves the lax pair ( [ lp1])-([lp2 ] ) at ( @xmath66 ) , @xmath67 solves the lax pair ( [ lp1])-([lp2 ] ) at ( @xmath68 ) , where @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    the transformation ( [ dt1])-([dt2 ] ) is called a darboux transformation .",
    "this theorem can be proved either through the connection between the heisenberg equation and the nls equation ( with a well - known darboux transformation ) @xcite , or through a direct calculation .",
    "notice also that @xmath72 .",
