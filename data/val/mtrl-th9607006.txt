    "in recent years the dissociative adsorption and associative desorption of hydrogen on metal surfaces has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the studies were motivated by the fact that for these relatively simple systems the process of bond breaking and bond making during dissociative adsorption can be analyzed in greater detail .    breaking a molecular bond",
    "is obviously coupled to the interatomic distance and molecular vibrations .",
    "therefore a large number of studies have addressed the influence of those vibrations on the dissociative adsorption and associative desorption , especially in the benchmark system h@xmath0/cu  @xcite . in desorption studies",
    "@xcite strong vibrational heating of the hydrogen molecules was found , i.e. , vibrational population ratios were much greater than expected for thermal equilibrium with the temperature of the substrate at which desorption occurs . according to the principle of microscopic reversibility",
    "this implies that the probability of dissociative adsorption should be enhanced for vibrational excited molecules , which indeed has been confirmed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "these vibrational effects were usually discussed  @xcite within the context of potential energy surfaces ( pess ) which depend only on two coordinates , namely the center of mass distance of the molecule from the surface , @xmath1 , and the h - h interatomic distance , @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , the motion of the two atoms of a diatomic molecule is governed by six coordinates , not just @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but the dependence on the other ( neglected ) four coordinates was felt to be of minor importance .",
    "it was generally accepted that the pes in the considered two - dimensional space ( a so - called `` elbow plot '' ) should exhibit a strongly curved reaction path and a so - called late barrier towards dissociative adsorption , i.e. a barrier after the curved region of the pes , close to the surface , in order to account for strong vibrational effects in dissociative adsorption and associative desorption .",
    "interestingly , strong vibrational heating was also found for hydrogen molecules desorbing from pd(100 )  @xcite , although for this substrate , in contrast to cu , the dissociative adsorption is non - activated @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , within the spirit of the above discussion for the h@xmath0/cu system , brenig _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reproduced the vibrational heating for h@xmath0 desorption from pd(100 ) by quantum dynamical calculations using two - dimensional model potentials with a minimum barrier of 200  mev .",
    "since this is in conflict with the fact that adsorption of h@xmath0 in non - activated , darling and holloway @xcite questioned the validity of this theoretical work and argued that one has to take into account a distribution of barrier heights which requires higher - dimensional calculations . in their model calculations , which were still two - dimensional , they basically showed that it is not possible to reproduce vibrational heating in desorption with a barrier - less two - dimensional elbow potential @xcite .",
    "recently we enhanced the computational approach for scattering of molecules at surfaces  @xcite and are now able to investigate reactions of diatomic molecules on surfaces with all six degrees of freedom of the molecule being treated quantum dynamically  @xcite .",
    "such a study was performed for the sticking probability of h@xmath0 at pd(100 )  @xcite employing a high - dimensional pes derived from first - principles calculations  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the same pes and the same six - dimensional ( 6-d ) quantum - dynamical method .",
    "the pes for the interaction of h@xmath0 and pd(100 ) possesses non - activated pathway , but also ( in fact in majority ) activated pathways  @xcite .",
    "it was found that h@xmath0 molecules impinging with small energies are efficiently steered along the non - activated pathways towards dissociatice adsorption  @xcite .",
    "however , with increasing energy the steering effect gets less effective and the majority of molecules proceeds via pathways with energy barriers  @xcite .",
    "the steering mechanism is operative for the translational degree of freedom as well as for the rotations  @xcite . in the meantime",
    "two predictions of the quantum dynamical calculations for h@xmath0/pd(100 ) , namely the strong rotational hindering of the dissociation at low kinetic energy  @xcite and the orientation dependence of adsorption and desorption  @xcite , have been confirmed experimentally @xcite .    in order to investigate the effects of molecular vibrations on the sticking probability we had to extend the calculations  @xcite to higher energies . to describe the dynamics of initially vibrating molecules",
    "properly we have increased the number of vibrational eigenfunctions in the expansion of the wave function of the hydrogen nuclei : in the present study up to 25,200 channels per total energy are taken into account compared to 21,000 channels which were considered previously  @xcite .",
    "we will show that in spite of the absence of a minimum barrier towards dissociative adsorption and a strongly curved reaction path there are still substantial vibrational effects in the adsorption and desorption of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) .",
    "we will demonstrate that they are caused by a strong lowering of the h - h vibrational frequency during the adsorption and by the multi - dimensionality of the pes relevant for the dissociation process . however , some discrepancies to the experimental results of refs .",
    "@xcite remain .",
    "( 10,9.0 )    figure [ elbow ] shows a cut through our pes of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) , where the most favorable path towards dissociative adsorption is marked by the dashed line .",
    "as discussed above , for this path there is no energy barrier hindering dissociation , i.e. , the adsorption is non - activated .",
    "the curvature of the optimum reaction pathway ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ elbow ] ) is relatively moderate compared to the curvature of reaction pathways of previously assumed or guessed pess which had been used in earlier low - dimensional studies  @xcite .",
    "the detailed total - energy calculations  @xcite showed that the pes is strongly anisotropic and corrugated so that besides non - activated paths the majority of pathways towards dissociative adsorption has in fact energy barriers with a rather broad distribution of heights and positions .",
    "the barrier height depends on the molecular orientation and impact site in the surface unit cell .",
    "figure [ stickvib ] presents results for the sticking probability as a function of the kinetic energy of a h@xmath0 beam under normal incidence .",
    "quantum mechanically determined sticking probabilities for hydrogen at surfaces with an attractive well exhibit an oscillatory structure as a function of the incident energy  @xcite , reflecting the opening of new scattering channels and resonances @xcite , as also observed in , e.g , leed @xcite .",
    "such oscillations have not been observed yet . in the experiments",
    "the molecular beams are not strictly mono - energetic but have a certain energetic broadening . for the calculations of fig .",
    "[ stickvib ] we assumed an energy width @xmath3 , typical for experiments  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the quantum dynamical oscillations are smoothed out .",
    "( 10,6.1 )    the solid curves correspond to 6-d calculations for h@xmath0 molecules initially in the vibrational ground and first excited state , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 curve shows the characteristic initial decrease of the sticking probability with increasing energy ( for @xmath5 ev ) which is due to the decreasing importance of the steering effect with increasing energy  @xcite .",
    "also for molecules initially in the first excited vibrational state a corresponding behavior is found , but for these the steering effect is strong only for very small energies ( @xmath6 mev ) . for kinetic energies",
    "higher than @xmath7  mev the @xmath8 molecules experience an increasing sticking probability which is significantly larger than for @xmath4 molecules .",
    "the effect of the initial vibrational state can be quantified by the vibrational efficacy @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the kinetic energy required to obtain the sticking probability @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 is the separation of the sticking curves for a certain sticking probability divided by the gas - phase vibrational quantum @xmath13  mev . in fig .",
    "[ stickvib ] we have marked @xmath14 , which leads to a value of the vibrational efficacy of @xmath15 .",
    "this means that 75% of the vibrational energy is effective in promoting the dissociative adsorption , a value even higher than in the h@xmath0/cu(111 ) system @xcite .",
    "( 10,6.1 )    to clarify why and how molecular vibrations effect the sticking probability we performed calculations for a reduced coordinate space , namely allowing only for five degrees of freedom for the two hydrogen atoms .",
    "this reduction was achieved by keeping the molecules in their initial vibrational state .",
    "although the vibrational state is kept fixed , the energy of the vibration , which is determined by the strength of the h - h interaction , will change along the scattering pathway . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ stickvib ] , these five - dimensional results are very close to the 6-d results .",
    "this reflects two facts .",
    "first , the molecular vibrational state is a sufficiently good quantum number and is almost conserved during the scattering , i.e. , the probability for transitions between different vibrational states during the scattering event is rather low . and second , the curvature of the reaction path of the h@xmath0/pd(100 ) pes is not crucial for the vibrational effects in this system because in the 5-d calculations no curvature is present in the hamiltonian .    as the next step we will analyze the `` vibrationally adiabatic potentials '' which are defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the coordinate along the reaction path ( see fig .  [ elbow ] ) .",
    "the vibrationally adiabatic potential is the relevant potential for the h@xmath0 molecule moving on the pes in a particular vibrational state taking the change of the vibrational frequency along the path into account . in fig .",
    "[ adiavib ] we have plotted the vibrational frequency together with the potential and the vibrational adiabatic potentials for @xmath4 and @xmath8 along the reaction path coordinate @xmath17 of fig .  [ elbow ] . at @xmath18 , the point of maximum curvature in fig .",
    "[ elbow ] , the vibrational frequency is strongly reduced from its gas phase value of @xmath19  mev to about 150  mev .",
    "this leads to a lowering of the vibrationally adiabatic potential by 183  mev for @xmath20 and by 549  mev for @xmath21 .",
    "such a lowering does not only occur for the most favorable adsorption path , but also for other non - activated and activated pathways , i.e. , for other impact sites in the surface unit cell and for other molecular orientations .",
    "this can be demonstrated by the integrated barrier distribution for the potential @xmath22 and the vibrationally adiabatic potentials @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ hole ] , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the polar and azimuthal orientation of the molecule , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the lateral coordinates of the hydrogen center - of - mass .",
    "@xmath28 is the area of the surface unit cell .",
    "each quadruple defines a cut through the six - dimensional space ( see fig .",
    "[ elbow ] for one example ) , and @xmath29 is the minimum energy barrier along such a cut .",
    "the function @xmath30 is the heavyside step function . the quantity @xmath31 , which is plotted in fig",
    ".  [ barrdist ] , is the fraction of the configuration space , for which the barrier towards dissociative adsorption is less than @xmath32 ; it corresponds to the sticking probability in the classical sudden approximation , which forms the basic approximation behind the so - called `` hole model '' @xcite .",
    "actually , the comparison of figs .",
    "[ stickvib ] and [ barrdist ] reveals that the hole model gives a satisfactory description of the sticking probabilities at high kinetic energies above 0.3  ev , whereas it is strongly at variance with full dynamical calculations at low kinetic energies , where the steering effect is operative .",
    "( 10,6.1 )    figure  [ barrdist ] demonstrates that the barrier distribution is lowered due to the decrease of the vibrational frequency by about 180  mev for molecules in the vibrational ground state compared to the potential @xmath33 and by further @xmath34400  mev for molecules in the first excited vibrational state . because of the lowered potential the vibrationally excited molecules",
    "are accelerated more strongly towards the surface , they become so fast that the steering mechanism is suppressed .",
    "for that reason the initial decrease of the sticking probability for @xmath21 is limited to low energies ( @xmath35 mev , see fig .",
    "[ stickvib ] ) .",
    "the difference in the barrier heights of about 400  mev is reflected by the energetic shift between the sticking curves for @xmath4 and @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ stickvib ] for sticking probabilities larger than @xmath340.7 .",
    "hence it is the strong decrease of the h - h vibrational frequency during the dissociation which causes the vibrational effects in adsorption .    in figs .",
    "[ adiavib ] and [ barrdist ] zero - point effects due to the frustrated rotation and translation parallel to the surface are not taken into account since we like to concentrate here on states with different vibrational quantum numbers .",
    "the influence of frustrated rotation and translation of the h@xmath0 molecule in contact with the surface will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "( 10.,6.1 )    according to the principle of detailed balance , the strong enhancement of the sticking probability of vibrationally excited molecules implies a strong vibrational heating of molecules observed in associative desorption .",
    "figure  [ vibdes ] displays the logarithm of the population ratio of the vibrationally first excited and the ground state in desorption versus the inverse surface temperature .",
    "the theoretical values were obtained by summing up over all final rotational states .",
    "the dashed line results from the assumption that the h@xmath0 vibrations are in thermal equilibrium with the surface temperature .",
    "indeed we find vibrational heating in our calculations . at @xmath36",
    "k the ratio is 2.5 times higher than for thermal equilibrium .",
    "absolute values of the vibrational heating in hydrogen desorption from pd(100 ) were only measured for d@xmath0 , not for h@xmath0 . in the system h@xmath0/ni(110 ) , which has a similar sticking curve as h@xmath0/pd(100 ) @xcite ,",
    "a vibrational heating of a factor of two was found @xcite , in good agreement with our results .",
    "the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ vibdes ] are only determined within a calibration factor   @xcite .",
    "this means that only the slope of the experimental data has significance , not the absolute values . from this slope an apparent activation energy @xmath37",
    "mev @xcite has been deduced .",
    "our theoretical work gives @xmath38  mev .",
    "considering the scatter in the experimental data  ( see fig .",
    "[ vibdes ] ) and the fact that the theory does not employ any empirical parameters , the comparison of the experimentally and theoretically obtained apparent barrier is satisfactory .",
    "in fact , an analysis of the measured sticking probability of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) @xcite makes it plausible that the apparent activation energy should be close to the gas - phase frequency of h@xmath0 .",
    "if we restrict ourselves for the sake of clarity to the two coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then according to the principle of detailed balance the vibrational population ratio in desorption is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the sticking probability for initial vibrational state @xmath41 and kinetic energy @xmath32 .",
    "now an analysis of eq .",
    "[ vibpop ] yields that a strong lowering of the apparent activation energy from the gas - phase vibrational energy can only be caused by a ratio which decreases exponentially with increasing kinetic energy",
    ". this would only be the case if increased exponentially with increasing energy , which requires the assumption of a minimum barrier towards dissociative adsorption , as was done in the calculations of refs .",
    "however , the sticking in the system h@xmath0/pd(100 ) is non - activated and initially decreases with increasing kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "such a sticking probability should not cause a lowering of the apparent activation energy for vibrational excitation in desorption , as reproduced by our calculations . either the principle of detailed balance is not directly applicable for the adsorption / desorption of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) , which seems to be improbable from the experience of hydrogen - on - metal systems @xcite , or there is an inconsistency between the adsorption and desorption experiments .",
    "we further note that the apparent activation energy in our calculations depends on the rotational states of the molecules .",
    "if one considers , e.g. , only @xmath42 rotational states , where @xmath43 is the final rotational quantum number , for the vibrational excitation in desorption , then the theoretical activation energy drops to @xmath44  mev .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sticking probability for molecules in the vibrational ground state becomes small ( less than 0.1 ) for @xmath45 @xcite , while for vibrationally excited molecules the sticking probability is almost independent of the initial rotational state .",
    "also the absolute value of the vibrational heating depends sensitively on the rotational quantum number ; for @xmath46 the vibrational heating rises to a factor of 3.6 .    for d@xmath0/pd(100 )",
    "a vibrational over - population in desorption of @xmath47 by a factor of nine was found @xcite , which is much higher than our result for h@xmath0/pd(100 ) .",
    "note that the interaction of d@xmath0 with pd(100 ) is given by _",
    "exactly _ the same pes as for h@xmath0 .",
    "at present , full quantum dynamical calculations for d@xmath0 are not feasible because the number of relevant , energetically accessible channels is significantly higher than for h@xmath0 due to the larger mass and the therefore smaller energetic level spacings .",
    "we do not expect , however , that the calculations for d@xmath0 would yield a vibrational heating of a factor of nine . again analyzing eq .",
    "[ vibpop ] , for such a large vibrational heating the sticking probability for @xmath4 states of d@xmath0 has to be below 0.1 for all energies , much lower than for h@xmath0 , but already the hole model , that does not take into account the steering effect , yields higher values ( see fig .",
    "[ barrdist ] ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy may lie in the determination of the pes . on the other hand , if all experimental results were correct , the application of the principle of detailed balance for the adsorption / desorption of hydrogen / pd(100 ) would yield a large isotope effect , which , for example , has not been found for hydrogen on pd(111 ) @xcite . it may also be that our understanding of the adsorption / desorption dynamics is still incomplete .",
    "in conclusion , we reported a six - dimensional quantum dynamical study of dissociative adsorption on and associative desorption from h@xmath0/pd(100 ) .",
    "we have shown that large vibrational effects in dissociative adsorption and associative desorption of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) exist .",
    "they are not due to a strongly curved reaction path and a late minimum barrier to adsorption , as was previously assumed , but they are caused by the strong lowering of the h - h vibrational frequency during the adsorption and the multi - dimensionality of the relevant phase space with its broad distribution of barrier heights .",
    "quantitative differences between experiment and theory and inconsistencies between adsorption and desorption experiments are identified which deserve further clarification .",
