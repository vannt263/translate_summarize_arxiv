    "the study of the role of a dissipative environment is of central importance to the field of quantum computation and for the fundamental understanding of the transition from quantum to classical behavior . in that context ,",
    "the dissipative two - level system ( tls ) is a well - studied paradigm @xcite .",
    "the generic tls , which in particular can be a spin @xmath0 particle , experiences dissipation due to its coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators . in the resulting spin - bath problem ,",
    "an external magnetic field interacts with one component of the spin operator ( e.g. @xmath1 ) while a second component ( e.g. @xmath2 ) couples to an oscillator bath .",
    "depending on the relative strength of the two interactions , one can switch over between underdamped and overdamped behaviour , as may become manifest through quantities such as the average spin energy or various correlation functions . recently",
    "castro neto _",
    "[ 3 , 4 ] have shown that if two components ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) of the effective spin are coupled to two different baths , then the competing effects of those baths can reduce the effect of dissipation .",
    "in particular , they have found that , for a given coupling strength , symmetric coupling to the two spin components is less decoherent than coupling to a single component .",
    "moreover , in the case of symmetric coupling to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , coherent behaviour is preserved for arbitrarily strong coupling .",
    "these two properties are remarkable because one would naively expect that coupling to a higher number of bath oscillators would increase the effect of dissipation .",
    "rather , they have shown that the competition between the baths contributes to protect the tls energy gap .",
    "the reduction of dissipation stems from the non - commutative character of the spin operators coupled to the different baths . logically , if the two baths interact with the same spin component , then no dissipation reduction is observed . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that this feature arises from the lack of a preferred basis to which the tls may relax at long times .",
    "this new phenomenon has been coined quantum frustration of decoherence , since it is interpreted as the frustrated attempt of the two environments to `` measure '' simultaneously two non - commuting observables .",
    "the study of refs .",
    "@xcite has been restricted to equilibrium properties such as the transverse susceptibility , which was evaluated using the numerical renormalization group .",
    "features of quantum frustration were also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was noted that the phase - number variable of a superconducting josephson junction is coupled simultaneously to two different dissipative environments : through the phase to the quasiparticle field and through the cooper pair number to the quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "the result is that the uncertainty in the macroscopic phase has contributions from both baths which tend to cancel each other .",
    "they never cancel completely because , in that particular case , the sources of dissipation differ widely both in nature and strength .",
    "frustration of decoherence in josephson networks has also been investigated @xcite    in refs .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of an oscillator coupled through its position and momentum to two different oscillator baths was studied .",
    "the problem can be shown to be equivalent to that of a large ( quasiclassical ) spin impurity in a ferromagnetic environment .",
    "it was noted that the dissipative oscillator may be driven from overdamped to underdamped behaviour by the symmetrical addition of a second bath .",
    "this surprising effect was found only for the case where the momentum operator ( @xmath4 ) and the position operator ( @xmath5 ) are coupled to two different baths . like in refs .",
    "@xcite , these effects were investigated through equilibrium properties such as the position - position response function .",
    "however , some dynamical aspects were also analyzed , noting that the purity of the quantum oscillator decays faster in the presence of two baths than in the presence of a single bath .",
    "this last result is important because it reveals that the competition between two baths coupling to non - commuting observables is not a universal panacea to suppress decoherence .",
    "our present study is motivated by the need for a more detailed understanding of the equilibrium and dynamical properties of a quantum system in the presence of competing environments .    in the studies of quantum frustration made earlier @xcite ,",
    "the bath has been modeled by a set of non - interacting oscillators . however",
    ", if the interpretation is correct that the essence of quantum frustration stems from the canonically conjugate character of the two observables which couple to separate baths , then one should expect a similar behaviour to appear when the dissipative environment is formed by a bath of spins acting on a central spin impurity .",
    "we note that , because of the vector nature of the spin , the spin bath can by itself be viewed as formed by several baths .",
    "thus a single spin bath may exhibit features of quantum frustration .",
    "spin baths have been studied @xcite as an alternative to the conventional oscillator models of quantum dissipation @xcite .",
    "they are known to give rise to non - markovian evolution , with the system evolution showing a strong dependence on the polarization of the initial state @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall evaluate the dynamical properties of a tls coupled to a bath of spins .",
    "similar to the work of novais _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , we shall consider the situation where the components of the spin are coupled to two different baths and study the effects of frustration arising due to the non - commuting nature of the spin components .",
    "the work of refs .",
    "@xcite was based on the method of the numerical renormalization group . by assuming that the bath has no internal dynamics of its own , we are able to perform an analytical study . comparing the case of coupling to a single component to that of symmetric coupling to both components , we find that the spectral function behaves similarly to the study of refs .",
    "namely , the spectral function develops a peak in the symmetric case which is absent in the case of single - component coupling . in refs .",
    "@xcite , this was interpreted as the preservation of decoherence arising from the frustrated attempt of the two environments to measure two non - commuting observables .",
    "however , we find that the emergence of the peak as the second bath intervenes is compatible with a fast decay of the quantum purity of the central spin .",
    "this means that the frustration induced by the two competing environments has more to do with dissipation than with decoherence .",
    "energy relaxation is indeed inhibited by the presence of a second bath coupled to the other spin component , while the quantum purity decays fast in the presence of a second bath , with only a minor form of frustration revealed by a short - lived revival which will be discussed .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the presentation of the model of a central spin coupled to a spin bath . in sec .",
    "3 we study the time evolution analytically , deriving expressions for the expectation values and the quantum purity of the central spin .",
    "sections 4 and 5 focus on the density of states and the response function of the central spin .",
    "section 6 deals with the tailoring of the spin bath properties which mimics the behavior of a spin coupled to a conventional bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "finally , the main conclusions of this work are summarized and discussed in sec . 7 .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a two - level - system which is linearly coupled through two non - commuting observables to two independent environments of two - level - systems .",
    "we will refer indistinctively to both the central impurity and the constituents of the bath as particles of spin @xmath0 or two - level - systems .",
    "if the spins of the environment carry their own dynamics , in general there are no conserved quantities other than energy and the system can not be treated analytically without approximations . however , in most of the solid - state spin systems where the spin bath interaction is a dominant source of mechanism for the dissipation of a tls , the internal bath dynamics is generally very slow ( for example in quantum dot systems , where the bath spins are nuclear spin half particles and the tls is the electronic spin , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore assume that both environments carry no dynamics of its own , i.  e.  that their hamiltonians are zero .",
    "thus the bath dynamics is exclusively due to its interaction with the central spin @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian of system and bath is then given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the components of the spin operator of the central spin and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are spin operators of the bath spins .",
    "we assume homogeneous interaction between the central spin and the baths .",
    "moreover we assume that the number of spins of each environment to be the same . the strength of the coupling to each environment",
    "is thus described by one parameter @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) only . for a single bath ",
    "environment the case of non  homogeneous coupling ( @xmath14 dependent on index @xmath15 , respectively ) was solved explicitly by in ref .",
    "however , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the only effect of inhomogeneous interaction is that of destroying certain revival effects .",
    "all other features can be captured within the homogeneous interaction between system and bath .",
    "the main advantage of the homogeneous interaction approximation is that exact , closed - form expressions for the expectation values and correlation functions can be obtained .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ fham0 ] ) is similar to that employed in refs .",
    "@xcite in that two different environments couple to the two perpendicular components of the central spin .",
    "the main difference with the model of refs .",
    "@xcite is the non - dynamic character of the bath , which we consider , which contrasts with the oscillator bath there considered .",
    "we shall examine whether our simpler model ( [ fham0 ] ) can yield frustration effects similar to those obtained from the more complex model of refs .",
    "@xcite , which was solved with the numerical renormalization group method .    in the particular case where the spin bath couples to only one component of the central spin , a number of non - trivial effects are known to appear , despite its apparent simplicity .",
    "one instance is the crossover from overdamped to underdamped behaviour as the coupling strength increases , similar to the spin - boson model where the tls is coupled to an oscillator bath @xcite . for a more complete account on the dynamics of a spin coupled to a single bath",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "in the absence of bath dynamics the @xmath16 and @xmath17components of the total spin of the respective environments , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are conserved quantities .",
    "we write the total hilbert space as a tensor product @xmath20 .",
    "the total @xmath21 dimensional hilbert space of the baths @xmath22 decomposes into invariant subspaces @xmath23 .",

    "( [ heff ] ) it is clear that the effect of the environment is to give rise to an effective magnetic field @xmath44 .",

    "we have analyzed the spectral properties of a two - level - system which is coupled to one or two dissipative baths through non - commuting observables .",
    "a peak in the spectrum at a nonzero frequency reveals the existence of an effective magnetic field experienced by the central spin .",
    "we have seen seen that the coupling to a second bath enhances rather than diminishes that effective field and , with it , the dynamics of the central spin . in the extreme case of a zero external field ,",
    "the nonzero field is generated solely from the competition of two environments coupling to non - commuting spin components .",
    "this fact is remarkable if one notes that the baths are assumed to be initially unpolarized .",
    "these physical effects arising from the non - commuting nature of the spin operators are a general feature of the dynamics which does not depend on details such as the markovian or non - markovian character of the reduced system dynamics or the strength of the system - bath interactions .",
    "in fact , we explicitly prove that the emergence of a peak in the spectral function is compatible with a fast decay of the quantum impurity .",
    "this suggests that , while dissipation is inhibited by the competition between the two baths , decoherence is not , at least in the long time behavior .",
    "our present results are entirely consistent with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite for a harmonic oscillator ( equivalent to a large or quasiclassical spin ) , where a fast decay of the quantum purity was found to coexist with a weak form of suppression of dissipation .",
    "here we have proved that the phenomenon of frustration of dissipation also exists for a dissipative two - level - system which , given its reduced dimensionality , is much more quantum in nature than the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the intuitive idea that two competing environments attempt to measure non - commuting observables and thus fail to generate decoherence sounds appealing but may be misleading",
    ". the statement would be true if the only possible result of a quantum measurement were to select a narrow distribution of eigenstates of the measured observable , since two non - commuting observables can not be simultaneously well defined .",
    "however , a possible outcome of the coupling to a dissipative environment is that the reduced density matrix , while becoming diagonal in the representation of the eigenstates of the measured observable , may display a broad probability distribution in that representation . in the limit in which that distribution is very broad , the reduced density approaches the identity matrix , which is invariant under a change of basis . thus a reduced density matrix may be simultaneously diagonal in the representations of two non - commuting observables , provided it is close to the identity matrix",
    "this is what actually happens to our central spin-@xmath184 , as is clearly revealed by the quantum purity tending to its minimum value 1/2 at long times , both for a single and a symmetric double bath .",
    "as we have seen , this feature is compatible with the reinforcement of the central spin dynamics resulting from the competition of the two environments .",
    "the upshot of the present study on the effect of competing environments is that , at least for dissipative two - level - systems , it may be misleading to speak of quantum frustration of decoherence and is more appropriate to introduce the concept of quantum frustration of dissipation",
    ".    we can not rule out however the possibility that the coexistence of decoherence and dynamics enhancement by two competing environments is a particular property of our dissipative model where the bath has no internal dynamics . a firmer conclusion on the existence or absence of decoherence frustration will require an understanding of the behavior of genuinely quantum properties such as purity or pair entanglement in the presence of competing environments with internal dynamics .",
