    "sample surveys have long been conducted to obtain reliable estimates of finite population descriptive parameters , such as totals , means , ratios and quantiles , and associated standard errors and normal theory intervals with large enough sample sizes .",
    "probability - sampling designs and randomization ( repeated sampling ) inference , also called the design - based approach , played a dominant role , especially in the production of official statistics , ever since the publication of the landmark paper by neyman ( @xcite ) which laid the theoretical foundations of the design - based approach .",
    "neyman s approach was almost universally accepted by practicing survey statisticians and it also inspired various important theoretical contributions , mostly motivated by practical and efficiency considerations . in this paper",
    "i  will first provide some highlights of the design - based approach , for handling sampling errors , to demonstrate its significant impact on survey sampling practice , especially on the production of official statistics ( sections [ 2 ] and [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "model - dependent approaches ( section  [ 3.2 ] ) that lead to conditional inferences more relevant and appealing than repeated sampling inferences have also been advanced ( brewer , @xcite ; royall , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , for large samples such approaches may perform very poorly under model misspecifications ; even small model deviations can cause serious problems ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", model - dependent approaches can play a  vital role in small area ( domain ) estimation , where the area - specific sample sizes are very small or even zero and make the design - based area - specific direct estimation either very unreliable or not feasible .",
    "demand for reliable small area statistics has greatly increased in recent years and to meet this growing demand , federal statistical agencies and other survey organizations are currently paying considerable attention to producing small area statistics using models and methods that can `` borrow strength '' across areas .",
    "hierarchical bayes ( hb ) model - dependent methods are particularly attractive in small area estimation because of their ability to handle complex modeling and provide `` exact '' inferences on desired parameters ( section [ 5 ] ) .",
    "i will highlight some hb developments in small area estimation that seem to have a significant impact on survey practice .",
    "i  will also discuss the role of nonparametric bayesian methods for inferences , based on large area - specific sample sizes , especially those providing bayesian inferences that can be also justified under the design - based framework ( section [ 4.2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath0models are needed , regardless of the approach used , to handle nonsampling errors that include measurement errors , coverage errors and missing data due to nonresponse . in the design - based approach ,",
    "a combined design and modeling approach is used to minimize the reliance on models , in contrast to fully model - dependent approaches ( section [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "for simplicity , i will focus on descriptive parameters , but survey data are also increasingly used for analytical purposes , in particular , to study relationships and making inferences on model parameters under assumed super - population models .",
    "for example , social and health scientists are interested in fitting linear and logistic regression models to survey data and then making inferences on the model parameters taking account of the survey design features ( section [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "in this section i will highlight some early landmark contributions to the design - based approach that had major impact on survey practice . prior to neyman ( @xcite )",
    ", sampling was implemented either by `` balanced '' sampling through purposive selection or by probability sampling with equal inclusion probabilities .",
    "such a method was called the `` representative method . ''",
    "bowley ( @xcite ) studied stratified sampling with proportional sample size allocation , leading to a representative sample with equal probabilities .",
    "neyman ( @xcite ) broke through this restrictive setup by relaxing the condition of equal probabilities and introducing the ideas of efficiency and optimal sample size allocation in his theory of stratified random sampling .",
    "he also demonstrated that balanced purposive sampling may perform poorly if the underlying model assumptions are violated .",
    "neyman proposed normal theory confidence intervals for large samples such that the frequency of errors in the confidence statements based on all possible stratified random samples that could be drawn does not exceed the limit prescribed in advance `` _ _ whatever the unknown properties of the finite population . _",
    "_ '' he broadened the definition of representative method by calling any method of sampling that satisfies the above frequency statement as representative .",
    "it is interesting to note that neyman advocated distribution - free design - based inferences for survey sampling in contrast to his own fundamental work on parametric inference , including the neyman ",
    "pearson theory of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals .",
    "the possibility of developing efficient probability sampling designs by minimizing total cost subject to a specified precision of an estimator or maximizing precision for a given cost , taking account of operational considerations , and making distribution - free inferences ( point estimation , variance estimation and large sample confidence intervals ) through the design - based approach were soon recognized.this , in turn , led to a significant increase in the number and type of surveys taken by probability sampling and covering large populations . in the early stages ,",
    "the primary focus was on sampling errors .",
    "i now list a few important post - neyman theoretical developments in the design - based approach .",
    "as early as 1937 , mahalanobis used multistage sampling designs for crop surveys in india .",
    "his classic 1944 paper ( mahalanobis , @xcite ) presents a rigorous theoretical setup and a generalized approach to the efficient design of sample surveys of different crops in bengal , india , with emphasis on variance and cost functions .",
    "mahalanobis considered a geographical region of finite area and defined a field consisting of `` a finite number , say , @xmath1 , of basic cells arranged in a definite space or geographic order together with a single value ( or a set of values in the multivariate case ) of @xmath2 for each basic cell , '' where  @xmath2 is the variable of interest ( say , crop yield ) . under this setup , he studied four different probability sampling designs for selecting a sample of cells ( called quads ) : unitary unrestricted , unitary configurational , zonal unrestricted and zonal configurational . in modern terminology , the four designs correspond to simple random sampling , stratified random sampling , single - stage cluster sampling and single - stage stratified cluster sampling , respectively .",
    "he developed realistic cost functions depending on particular situations .",
    "he also extended the theoretical setup to subsampling of clusters ( which he named as two - stage sampling ) .",
    "we refer the reader to murthy ( @xcite ) for a detailed account of the 1944 paper and other contributions of mahalanobis to sample surveys .",
    "hall ( @xcite ) provides a scholarly historical account of the pioneering contributions of mahalanobis to the early development of survey sampling in india .",
    "mahalanobis was instrumental in establishing the national sample survey of india and the famous indian statistical institute .",
    "survey statisticians at the u.s . census bureau , under the leadership of morris hansen , made fundamental contributions to survey sampling theory and practice during the period 19401970 , and many of those methods are still widely used in practice .",
    "this period is regarded as the golden era of the census bureau .",
    "hansen and hurwitz ( @xcite ) developed the basic theory of stratified two - stage cluster sampling with one cluster or primary sampling unit ( psu ) within each stratum drawn with probability proportional to a size measure ( pps ) and then subsampled at a rate that ensures self - weighting ( equal overall probabilities of selection ) .",
    "this method provides approximately equal interviewer work loads which are desirable in terms of field operations .",
    "it can also lead to significant variance reduction by controlling the variability arising from unequal psu sizes without actually stratifying by size and thus allowing stratification on other variables to further reduce the variance .",
    "the hansen  hurwitz method , with some modifications , has been widely used for designing large - scale socio - economic , health and agricultural surveys throughout the world .",
    "many large - scale surveys are repeated over time , such as the monthly current population survey ( cps ) , and rotation sampling with partial replacement of ultimate units ( e.g. , households ) is used to reduce response burden .",
    "hansen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) developed simple but efficient composite estimators under rotation sampling in the context of stratified multistage sampling .",
    "rotation sampling and composite estimation are widely used in large - scale surveys .",
    "prior to the 1950s , the primary focus was on estimating totals , means and ratios for the whole population and large planned subpopulations such as us states or provinces in canada .",
    "woodruff ( @xcite ) developed a unified design - based approach for constructing confidence intervals on quantiles using only the estimated distribution function and the associated standard error .",
    "this ingenious method is to general probability sampling designs and performs well in terms of coverage probabilities in many cases .",
    "woodruff intervals can also be used to obtain standard errors of estimated quantiles ( rao and wu , @xcite ; francisco and fuller , @xcite ) .",
    "because of those features , the woodruff method had a significant impact on survey practice .",
    "however , the  method should not be treated as a black box for constructing confidence intervals on quantiles , because it can perform poorly in some practical situations .",
    "for example ,  it performed very poorly under stratified random sampling when the population is stratified by a concomitant variable @xmath3 highly correlated with the variable of interest @xmath4 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the failure of the woodruff method in this  case stems from the fact that the standard error of the estimated distribution function at the quantile will be too small due to zero contributions to the standard error from most strata .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) showed that the bootstrap method for stratified random sampling performs better than the woodruff method in this case , but in other situations the woodruff method is better .",
    "attention was also given to inferences for unplanned subpopulations ( also called domains ) such as age ",
    "sex groups within a state .",
    "hartley ( @xcite ) and durbin ( @xcite ) developed simple , unified theories for domain estimation applicable to general designs , requiring only existing formulae for population totals and means .",
    "after the consolidation of basic design - based sampling theory , hansen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and others paid attention to measurement errors in surveys .",
    "they developed basic theories under additive measurement error models with minimal model assumptions on the observed responses treated as random variables .",
    "total variance of an estimator is decomposed into sampling variance , simple response variance and correlated response variance ( crv ) due to interviewers .",
    "the crv was shown to dominate the total variance when the number of interviewers is small , and the 1950 u.s .",
    "census interviewer variance validation study showed that this component is indeed large for small areas .",
    "partly for this reason , self - enumeration by mail was first introduced in the 1960 u.s .",
    "census to reduce the crv component .",
    "earlier , mahalanobis ( @xcite ) developed the method of interpenetrating subsamples ( called replicated sampling by deming , @xcite ) and used it extensively in large - scale surveys in india for assessing both sampling and interviewer errors . by assigning the subsamples at random to interviewers , the total variance can be estimated and interviewer differences assessed .",
    "it should be clear from the above brief description of early developments that much of the basic sampling theory was developed by official statisticians or those closely associated with official statistics .",
    "theory was driven by the need to solve real problems and often theory was not challenging enough to attract academic researchers to survey sampling . as a  result ,",
    "university researchers paid little attention to survey sampling in those days with few exceptions ( e.g. , iowa state university under the leadership of cochran , jessen and hartley ) .",
    "we first give a brief account of the model - assisted approach that uses a working model to find efficient estimators .",
    "however , the associated inferences are design - based . consider a finite population @xmath5 consisting of @xmath6 elements labeled @xmath7 with associated values @xmath8 of a variable of interest @xmath4 . under a probability sampling design ,",
    "the inclusion probabilities @xmath9 are all strictly positive and a basic estimator of the total @xmath10 is of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes a sample and @xmath13 are the so - called design weights ( horvitz and thompson , @xcite ; narain , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the neyman stratified random sampling design , the design weights are equal to the inverse of the sampling fractions within strata and vary across strata , while in the hansen et al . two - stage cluster sampling design , the design weights are all equal .",
    "design unbiasedness of estimators is not insisted upon ( contrary to statements in some papers on inferential issues of sampling theory ) because it `` often results in much larger mse than necessary '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "instead , design consistency is deemed necessary for large samples . strategies ( design and estimation ) that appeared reasonable",
    "are entertained ( accounting for costs ) and relative properties are carefully studied by analytical and/or empirical methods , mainly through the comparison of mean squared error ( mse ) or anticipated mse under plausible population models on the variables @xmath14 treated as random variables .",
    "this is essentially the basis of the repeated sampling ( or designbased ) approach .    in recent years",
    ", a model - assisted repeated sampling approach has received the attention of survey practitioners . in this approach ,",
    "a working population model is used to find efficient design - consistent estimators .",
    "for example , suppose the working model is a linear regression model of the form @xmath15 with model errors @xmath16 assumed to be uncorrelated with mean zero and variance proportional to a known constant @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a vector of auxiliary variables with known population total @xmath19 . under model  ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "the best linear unbiased estimator ( blue ) of the model parameter @xmath20 , based on the census values @xmath21 , is given by the `` census '' regression coefficient @xmath22 a predictor of @xmath14 under the working model is then given by @xmath23 for @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the design - weighted estimator of @xmath26 : @xmath27 by writing the total as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the prediction error , a design - based estimator of @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 .",
    "we can express this estimator as a generalized regression ( greg ) estimator @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( srndal , swensson and wretman , @xcite ) .",
    "the greg estimator ( [ e2 ] ) is design - consistent regardless of the validity of the working model ( robinson and sarndal , @xcite ) under certain regularity conditions provided @xmath19 is precisely correct .",
    "if the working model provides a good fit to the data , then the residuals @xmath34 should be less variable than the response values @xmath14 and the greg estimator is likely to be significantly more efficient than the basic design - weighted estimator  @xmath35 .    the estimator ( [ e2 ] ) may also be expressed as a weighted sum @xmath36 , where @xmath37 with @xmath38 the adjustment factors @xmath39 , popularly known as the  @xmath40-weights , ensure the calibration property @xmath41 so that the greg estimator when applied to the sample values @xmath18 agrees with the known total  @xmath19 .",
    "this property is attractive to the user when the vector @xmath19 contains user - specified totals .",
    "the assumption of a working linear regression model ( [ eq1 ] ) can be relaxed by adopting more flexible working models .",
    "for example , breidt , claeskens and opsomer ( @xcite ) proposed a nonparametric model - assisted approach based on a penalized spline ( p - spline ) regression working model and showed that the resulting estimators are design - consistent and more efficient than the usual greg estimators based on linear regression working models when the latter are incorrectly specified .",
    "also , the p - spline model - assisted estimators were shown to be approximately as efficient as the greg estimators when the linear regression working model is correctly specified .",
    "the p - spline approach can be easily implemented using existing estimation packages for greg because the underlying model is closely related to a  linear regression model .",
    "it offers a wider scope for the model - assisted approach because it makes minimal assumptions on the regression of @xmath4 on @xmath3 without assuming a specific parametric form .    under the model - assisted approach , design - consistent variance estimators",
    "are obtained either by a  taylor linearization method or by a resampling method ( when applicable ) , provided the probability sampling design ensures strictly positive joint inclusion probabilities @xmath42 , @xmath43 . using the estimator and associated standard error ,",
    "asymptotically valid normal theory intervals are obtained regardless of the validity of the working model .",
    "most large - scale surveys are multipurpose and observe multiple variables of interest , and the same working model may not hold for all the variables of interest . in that case , a model - assisted approach may lead to possibly different @xmath39 and hence different calibration weights @xmath44 associated with the variables , that is , the calibration weights are of the form  @xmath45 associated with the variable @xmath46 and sample unit  @xmath47 . however , survey users prefer to use a commonweight  @xmath44 for all variables of interest .",
    "this is often accomplished by minimizing a suitable distance measure between @xmath48 and @xmath44 for @xmath49 subject to userspecified calibration constraints , say , @xmath50 , without appealing to any working model , where @xmath51 is the vector of known totals associated with the user - specified variables @xmath2 . for example , a chi - squared distance measure leads to common calibrationweights  @xmath44 of the form @xmath52 where @xmath39 is given by  ( [ e3 ] ) with  @xmath18 replaced by @xmath53 ( deville and sarndal , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , calibration estimation in this case corresponds to using model - assisted estimation based on a linear regression model ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath53 as the vector of predictor variables .",
    "calibration estimation has attracted the attention of users due to its ability to produce common calibration weights and accommodate an arbitrary number of user - specified calibration ( or benchmark ) constraints , for example , calibration to the marginal counts of several post - stratification variables .",
    "several national statistical agencies have developed software designed to compute calibration weights : ges ( statistics canada ) , lin weight ( statistics netherlands ) , calmar ( insee , france ) and clan97 ( statistics sweden ) .",
    "sarndal ( @xcite ) says , `` calibration has established itself as an important methodological instrument in large - scale production of statistics . ''",
    "brakel and bethlehem ( @xcite ) noted that the use of common calibration weights for estimation in multipurpose surveys makes the calibration method `` very attractive to produce timely official releases in a regular production environment . ''",
    "@xmath0unfortunately , the model - free calibration approach can lead to erroneous inferences for some of the response variables , even in fairly large samples if the underlying working linear regression model uses an incorrect or incomplete set of auxiliary variables , unlike the model - assisted approach that uses a working model obtained after some model checking .",
    "for example , suppose that the underlying model is a  quadratic regression model of @xmath4 on @xmath3 and the distribution of @xmath3 is highly skewed .",
    "also , suppose that the user - specified calibration constraints are the known population size @xmath6 and the known population total @xmath19 . in this case , the calibration estimator of the total @xmath30 under simple random sampling is the familiar simple linear regression estimator with @xmath3 as the predictor variable .",
    "on the other hand , a model - assisted estimator under the quadratic regression working model is given by a multiple linear regression estimator with @xmath54 and @xmath55 as the predictor variables , assuming the total of @xmath56 is also known .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) demonstrated that the coverage performance of the normal theory interval associated with the calibration estimator is poor even in fairly large samples , unlike the coverage performance of the normal theory intervals associated with the model - assisted estimator .",
    "the coverage performance depends on the skewness of the residuals from the fitted model and in the case of calibration estimation the skewness of residuals after fitting simple linear regression remains large , whereas the skewness of residuals after fitting quadratic regression is small even if @xmath4 and @xmath3 are highly skewed .",
    "this simple example demonstrates that the population structure does matter in design - based inferences and that it should be taken into account through a model - assisted approach based on suitable working models .",
    "but the model - assisted approach has the practical limitation that the weight  @xmath44 may vary across variables in surveys with multiple variables of interest , unlike in the calibration approach . also , for complex working models , such as the p - spline , all the population values of the predictor variables should be known in order to implement the model - assisted approach .",
    "the model - assisted approach is essentially design - based , unlike the model - dependent approach ( section  [ 3.2 ] ) that can provide conditional inferences referring to the particular sample , @xmath12 , of units selected .",
    "such conditional inferences may be more relevant and appealing than the unconditional repeated sampling inferences used in the design - based approach .",
    "the frequentist model - dependent approach to inference assumes that the population structure obeys a specified population model and that the same model holds for the sample , that is , no sample selection bias with respect to the assumed population model .",
    "sampling design features are often incorporated into the model to reduce or eliminate the sample selection bias ( see section [ 3.3 ] for some difficulties to implement this in practice ) .",
    "typically , distributional assumptions are avoided by focusing on point estimation , variance estimation and associated normal theory confidence intervals , as in the case of design - based inferences . as a result , models used specify only the mean",
    "function and the variance function of the variable of interest , @xmath4.we refer the reader to valliant , dorfman and royall ( @xcite ) for an excellent account of the model - dependent approach .",
    "as noted in section [ 1 ] , model - dependent strategies may perform poorly in large samples when the population model is not correctly specified ; even small deviations from the assumed model that are not easily detectable through routine model checking can cause serious problems . in the hansen , madow and tepping ( @xcite ) example of an incorrectly specified population model ,",
    "the best linear unbiased prediction ( blup ) estimator of the mean is not design consistent under their stratified simple random sampling design with near optimal sample allocation ( commonly used to handle highly skewed populations such as business populations ) . as a result , model - dependent confidence intervals",
    "exhibited poor performance : for @xmath57 , coverage was around 70% compared to nominal level of 95% , while coverage for model - assisted intervals was 94.4% . to get around",
    "this difficulty , little ( @xcite ) proposed restricting attention to models that hold for the sample and for which the blup estimator is design consistent .",
    "for example , in the @xcite ( @xcite ) example , the blup of the mean under a model with means differing across strata is identical to the traditional stratified mean which is design consistent .",
    "but it seems not possible even to find a suitable model under which the widely used combined ratio estimator of the mean under the stratified random sampling is the blup estimator .",
    "the combined ratio estimator is a model - assisted estimator under a  ratio working model with a common slope .",
    "it allows a  large number of strata with few sample units from each stratum and yet remains design consistent , unlike the separate ratio estimator which is the blup estimator under a ratio model with separate slopes across strata : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the values of the variable of interest @xmath4 and an auxiliary variable @xmath3 for the unit @xmath47 in stratum @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , the blup estimator under this model requires the knowledge of the strata population means @xmath63 , whereas the combined ratio estimator requires only the overall population mean  @xmath64 .",
    "it is also not clear how one proceeds to formulate suitable models for general sampling designs that lead to design - consistent blup estimators .",
    "further , the main focus has been on point estimation and it is not clear how one should proceed with variance estimation and setting up confidence intervals that have repeated sampling validity . in this context , pfeffermann ( @xcite ) says , `` i presume that these are supposed to be computed under the corrected model as well .",
    "are we guaranteed that they are sufficiently accurate under the model ?",
    "do we need to robustify them separately ? ''",
    "little ( @xcite ) , in his rejoinder to pfeffermann s comment , says that he advocates using some replication method for variance estimation and then appealing to normal approximation for confidence intervals .",
    "clearly , further work is needed to address the above issues .",
    "note that if parametric assumptions are made , such as normality of model errors , then it is possible to make exact bayesian inferences by introducing suitable priors on the model parameters ( section [ 4 ] ) .",
    "some recent work on the model - dependent approach focused on avoiding misspecification of the mean function @xmath65 by using p - spline models .",
    "zheng and little ( @xcite , @xcite ) studied single stage pps sampling using a p - spline model , based  on the size measure @xmath3 used in pps sampling , to represent the regression function @xmath66 , and a specified function of the size measure as the variance function . in a simulation study , they compared the performance of the usual linear greg estimator and the p - spline model - based estimators , not necessarily design - consistent , and showed that the p - spline  model - based estimators are generally more efficient than the greg or the nht estimator in terms of design mse even for large samples .",
    "however , the simulation study did not consider model - assisted estimators corresponding to their p - spline model .",
    "the simulations also showed that the design - bias for their  p - spline estimators is minor , even though the estimators are not design - consistent , and hence the authors conclude that `` design consistency may not be of paramount importance . '' on the other hand , in the @xcite ( @xcite ) study ,  their model - assisted p - spline estimator is sometimes much better , and never worse , than the corresponding p - spline model - based estimator under stratified random sampling .",
    "the latter estimator is not design - consistent under the p - spline model considered by @xcite ( @xcite ) .    as noted above",
    ", a main advantage of the frequentist model - dependent approach is that it leads to inferences conditional on the selected sample of units , @xmath12 , unlike the unconditional design - based approach .",
    "however , it is possible to develop a conditional model - assisted approach that allows us to restrict the reference set of samples to a `` relevant '' subset of all possible samples specified by the design .",
    "conditionally valid inferences for large samples can then be obtained .",
    "rao ( @xcite ) and casady and valliant ( @xcite ) developed an `` optimal '' linear regression estimator that is asymptotically valid under the conditional setup .",
    "we refer the reader to kalton ( @xcite ) for compelling arguments for favoring design - based approaches ( possibly model - assisted and/or conditional ) to handle sampling errors .",
    "smith ( @xcite ) named the traditional repeated sampling inference as `` procedural inference '' and argued that procedural inference is the correct approach for surveys in the public domain .",
    "data collected from large - scale socio - economic , health and other surveys are being extensively used for analysis purposes , such as inferences on the regression parameters of linear and logistic regression population models . ignoring the survey design features and using standard methods can lead to erroneous on model parameters because of sample selection bias caused by informative sampling .",
    "it is tempting to expand the models by including among the predictors all the design variables that define the selection process at the various levels and then ignore the design and apply standard methods to the expanded model .",
    "the main difficulties with this approach , advocated by some leading researchers , are the following , among others ( pfeffermann and sverchkov , @xcite ) : ( 1 )  not all design variables may be known or accessible to the analyst .",
    "( 2 ) too many design variables can lead to difficulties in making inferences from the expanded models .",
    "( 3 )  the expanded model may no longer be of scientific interest to the analyst .",
    "the design - based approach can provide asymptotically valid repeated sampling inferences without changing the analyst model . a unified approach based on survey - weighted estimating equations leads to design - consistent estimators of the `` census '' or finite population parameters , which in turn estimate the associated model parameters .",
    "further , using resampling methods for variance estimation , such as the jackknife and the bootstrap for survey data , asymptotically valid design - based inferences on the census parameters can be implemented .",
    "the same methods may also be applicable for inference on the model parameters , in many cases of large - scale surveys . in the other cases , it is necessary to estimate the model variance of the census parameters from the sample .",
    "the estimate of the total variance is then given by the sum of this estimate and the resampling variance estimate .",
    "@xmath0 in practice , the data file would contain for each  sampled unit the variables of interest and predictor variables , final weights after adjustment for unit nonresponse and the corresponding replication weights , for example , bootstrap weights .",
    "the analyst can use software that handles survey weights ( such as sas ) to obtain point estimates from the final weights and the corresponding point estimates for each bootstrap replicate using bootstrap weights .",
    "the variability of the bootstrap point estimates provides asymptotically valid standard errors for designs commonly used in large - scale surveys .",
    "details of the methods are not provided due to space limitations , but the reader is referred to rao ( @xcite , section 6 ) for a succinct account of analysis of survey data using resampling methods for variance estimation and normal theory confidence intervals .",
    "design - based approach using resampling methods is extensively used in practice and software is also available ( e.g. , wesvar , stata ) .",
    "the design - based approach has also been applied to make inferences on the regression parameters and the variance parameters of multilevel models from data obtained from multistage sampling designs corresponding to the levels of the model .",
    "for example , in an education study of students , schools ( first - stage units or clusters ) may be selected with probabilities proportional to school size and students ( second - stage units ) within selected schools by stratified random sampling .",
    "again , ignoring the sampling design and using traditional methods for multilevel models that ignore the design can lead to erroneous inferences in the presence of sample selection bias . in  the design - based approach , estimation of variance parameters of the model is more difficult than that  of regression parameters and the necessary information for estimating variance parameters is often not provided in public - use data files which typically report only the final weight for each sample unit . widely used design - based methods have been proposed in the literature ( e.g. , pfeffermann et al . , @xcite , and rabe - hesketh and skrondal , @xcite ) to handle variance parameters that require the weights within sampled clusters in addition to the weights associated with the clusters .",
    "some of those methods can be implemented using the stata program gllamm .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting estimators of variance parameters may not be design - model consistent when the sample sizes within clusters are small , even for two - level linear models . korn and",
    "graubard ( @xcite ) demonstrated the bias problem and proposed a different method for simple two - level or three - level models involving only a common mean as the fixed effect .",
    "this method first obtains the census parameters and then estimates those parameters .",
    "it worked well in empirical studies even for small within - cluster sample sizes .",
    "rao , verret and hidiroglou ( @xcite ) proposed a weighted estimating equations ( wee ) approach for general two - level linear models that uses within - cluster joint inclusion probabilities , similar to korn and graubard ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wee method leads to design - model consistent estimators of variance parameters even for smallwithin - cluster sample sizes , provided the number of sample clusters is large .",
    "it performed well in empirical studies compared to the other methods proposed in the literature .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) also proposed a unified approach based on a weighted log - composite likelihood that can handle generalized linear multilevel models and small within - cluster sample sizes .",
    "this method is currently under investigation .",
    "a drawback of the design - based approach to the analysis of survey data is that it may lead to loss in efficiency when the final weights vary considerably across the sampling units .",
    "alternative approaches that can reduce the variability of the weights and thus lead to more efficient estimators have also been proposed ( e.g. , pfeffermann and sverchkov , @xcite ; fuller , @xcite , chapter 6 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to pfeffermann ( @xcite ) and rao et al .",

    "however , the bayesian approach also provides the posterior variance which is typically different from the estimated mean squared prediction error ( mspe ) of the eblup estimator ; several different methods of estimating mspe have been proposed in the context of small area estimation ( rao , @xcite , chapter 7 ) .",

    "the likelihood function based on the full sample data , however , is noninformative in the sense that all possible unobserved values of the parameter vector have the same likelihood function ( godambe , @xcite ) .",
    "one way out of this difficulty is to take a bayesian route by assuming an informative ( exchangeable ) prior on the @xmath83-dimensional parameter vector and combine it with the noninformative likelihood ( ericson , @xcite ; binder , @xcite ) to get an informative posterior , but inferences do not depend on the sample design ; ericson argued that an exchangeable prior assumption may be reasonable under simple random sampling .",

    "s approach extends to the unbalanced case with unequal cluster sizes .",
    "although the pp approach is attractive and seems to provide calibrated bayesian inferences at least for some simple sampling designs , it is unlikely to be used in the production of official statistics because of the underlying assumption that `` unseen are like the seen '' and each case needs to be studied carefully to develop suitable pp .",
    "also , it is not clear how this method can handle complex designs , such as stratified multistage sampling designs , or even single stage unequal probability sampling without replacement with nonnegligible sampling fractions , and provide design - calibrated bayesian inferences . , the pp approach may be useful for some specialized surveys and when inferences are desired on a variety of finite population parameters associated with the variable of interest @xmath4 or prior knowledge on the parameters is available , as in the case of nelson and meeden ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to start with an informative likelihood based on reduced data .",
    "for example , under simple random sampling , it may be reasonable to suppress the labels @xmath47 from the full data @xmath88 and use the likelihood based on the reduced data @xmath89 see hartley and rao ( @xcite ) and royall ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , for stratified random sampling , labels within strata are suppressed but strata labels are retained because of known strata differences . hartley and rao ( @xcite ) proposed a `` scale - load '' approach for inference on the mean @xmath84 . under this approach ,",

    "typically , closed - form expressions for desired posterior distributions do not exist , but powerful mcmc methods are now available for simulating samples from the desired posterior distribution and then computing the desired posterior summaries .",
    "rao ( @xcite , chapter  10 ) gives a detailed account of the hb methods in the small area context ; see also the review paper by datta ( @xcite ) , section  3 .",

    "for example , the commonly used posterior predictive @xmath126-value ( ppp ) for checking goodness of fit may not be powerful enough to detect nonnormality of random effects ( sinharay and stern , @xcite ) because this measure makes `` double use '' of data in the sense of first generating values from the predictive posterior distribution and then calculating the @xmath126-value .",
    "bayarri and castellanos ( @xcite ) say , `` double use of the data can result in an extreme conservatism of the resulting @xmath126-values . ''",

    "hb methods studied in the literature have been largely parametric , based on specified distributions for the data . however , meeden ( @xcite ) extended his noninformative bayesian approach , based on the polya posterior ( pp ) , to small area estimation in some simple cases .",
    "extension of this approach to handle complex models is not likely to be easy in practice .",
    "i have provided an appraisal of the role of bayesian and frequentist methods in sample surveys .",
    "my opinion is that for domains ( subpopulations ) with sufficiently large samples , a traditional design - based frequentist approach that makes effective use of auxiliary information , through calibration or assistance from working models , will remain as the preferred approach in the large - scale production of official statistics from complex surveys .",
    "nonsampling errors can be handled using a combined design and model approach with minimal use of models .",
    "but the designbased approach , using survey weights , is not a  panacea even for large samples and yet `` many people ask too much of the weights '' ( lohr , @xcite ) , prompting statements like , `` survey weighting is a mess '' ( gelman , @xcite ) .",
    "as lohr ( @xcite ) noted , survey weighting is not a mess as long as the weighting is not stretched to a limit as in the case of a very large number of post - stratified cells leading to very small or even zero cell sample sizes , thus making weighting at the cell level unstable or even not feasible ( gelman , @xcite ) .",
    "alternative weighting methods can be used in those situations to get around this problem .",
    "for example , by calibrating to the marginal counts of the post - stratification variables instead of the cell counts leads to a calibration estimator with stable weights which should perform well for estimating population totals or means . also , the resulting weights do not depend on the response values , thus ensuring internal consistency , unlike the hierarchical regression method proposed by gelman ( @xcite ) based on models involving random effects",
    ".    recent work on nonparametric bayesian methods that can be used for both bayesian and design - based inferences looks promising , at least for some specialized surveys . for small area estimation , the hierarchical bayes ( hb ) approach offers a lot of promise because of its ability to handle complex small area models and provide `` exact '' inferences .",
    "however , the choice of noninformative priors that can provide frequentist validity is not likely to be easy in practice when complex modeling is involved .",
    "also , caution needs to be exercised in the routine use of popular hb model - checking methods .",
