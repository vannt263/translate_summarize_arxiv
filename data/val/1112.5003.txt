    "this article deals with the following issue : is there a distinctive signature of the onset of antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order in the optical spectrum of a strongly correlated insulating antiferromagnet , for example an antiferromagnetic transition - metal oxide ?",
    "af ordering is a characteristic feature of strongly correlated mott insulators where superexchange drives the ordering of localized magnetic moments . on the other hand , af can also arise from fermi - surface nesting in a weakly correlated material . from a theoretical point of view , a continuous crossover driven by the interaction strength connects weak- and strong - coupling antiferromagnets , and an unambiguous distinction between local - moments and fermi - surface af is lacking .",
    "in this work we propose that , remarkably , optical spectroscopy can be used to infer the correlated nature of an af state .",
    "optical spectroscopy is an invaluable experimental probe of correlated materials , providing key physical information such as the optical gap , the relative weight of low - energy drude excitations in metallic systems , and quite importantly the transfers of spectral weights often observed in correlated materials when temperature or composition are varied ( for a recent review see ref . ) .",
    "spin degrees of freedom are however much less coupled to light than the charge so that the signatures of magnetism are expected to be comparatively weak .",
    "zone - center magnons , for example , do not show up in the optical conductivity unless inversion symmetry is broken@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the key energy scale associated with magnetic ordering , the superexchange @xmath1 ( @xmath2 with @xmath3 being half the bandwidth ) , is much smaller than the scale @xmath4 corresponding to the local matrix element of the screened coulomb interaction , and hence generally significantly smaller than the optical gap itself ( @xmath5 ) .    despite these shortcomings ,",
    "we show that clear signatures associated with antiferromagnetism are expected in the optical conductivity below the nel temperature ( @xmath6 ) when the system is in the strong - coupling ( mott insulating ) regime .",
    "these signatures are twofold .",
    "first , there is a spectral weight transfer as one cools the system from above the nel temperature down to low temperature .",
    "this transfer actually provides a diagnostics of the strong - coupling ( superexchange ) or weak - coupling ( spin - density wave ) nature of the antiferromagnetism . in the former case ,",
    "spectral weight increase is observed , corresponding to a kinetic energy gain associated with the ordering . in the latter case ,",
    "a spectral weight decrease takes place , corresponding to a kinetic energy loss ( potential energy gain ) . for superconducting long - range order , similar diagnostics of weak vs. strong - coupling pairing",
    "have been discussed and probed experimentally in the context of cuprate superconductors@xcite and for models with attractive interaction@xcite .",
    "second , a multi - peak structure develops above the gap in the ordered phase at strong coupling .",
    "these peaks correspond to the spin - polaron excitations associated with the motion of a hole in the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "they have been previously discussed in the context of one - particle spectroscopy such as photoemission in refs .",
    "[ , ] and this work identifies their signature in the optical conductivity .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility of detecting these signatures experimentally , and discuss in detail the case of lasrmno@xmath0 where we argue that some of these effects may already have been observed@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we summarize the main aspects of our calculation of the optical conductivity for the hubbard and @xmath7-@xmath1 model .",
    "details on the dmft calculations for the two models are provided in appendix [ sec : tj ] and [ sec : approxse ] , respectively . in section [ sec : results ] we discuss the main theoretical results before we compare them to experiment in section [ sec : comp ] .",
    "a summary and conclusion is given in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in order to study the optical conductivity of strongly correlated antiferromagnets , we perform dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) calculations for a half - filled hubbard model , described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath8 here , @xmath7 denotes the hopping amplitude between nearest - neighbors , @xmath4 the coulomb interaction , and @xmath9(@xmath10 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath11 on site @xmath12 ; @xmath13 . for simplicity",
    ", we use a semi - elliptical density of states of half - width @xmath3 , corresponding to a bethe lattice with infinite coordination .",
    "our results however hardly depend on this specific choice .",
    "we vary the temperature @xmath14 from above to below the nel temperature .",
    "we therefore need the paramagnetic and the antiferromagnetically ordered solutions , which can both be calculated within dmft@xcite .",
    "it is known that the hubbard model for large values of the local repulsion @xmath4 maps onto the @xmath15 model . for the specific model under consideration ,",
    "the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 is the following : for an individual pair of sites we have @xmath16 and summed over all nearest neighbors @xmath17 we have @xmath18 ( coined @xmath19 in ref .  ) .",
    "the quantities of interest in the @xmath15 model in infinite dimensions can be expressed in the form of a simple continued - fraction@xcite while the hubbard model requires a more computationally expensive solver .",
    "therefore we will often use the @xmath15 solutions in the case of the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "indeed , the electron - removal part of the @xmath20-integrated spectral function of an half - filled hubbard model below @xmath6 coincides up to higher order terms in @xmath1 with the spectral function of a single hole in the @xmath15 model . the way we compute the optical conductivity for the @xmath15 model , and in particular how we get across the absence of an electron addition part of the spectrum of the @xmath15 model ,",
    "is explained in detail in the appendix .    within dmft",
    "the optical conductivity can be expressed exactly in terms of the convolution of two single - particle green functions without vertex corrections @xcite . in the antiferromagnetic phase",
    "this reads @xcite : @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the fermi distribution function , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the green function of an electron with spin @xmath25 hopping between sites of the same sublattice and between sites of the two different sublattices @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in which the bethe lattice is split in the af phase .    in this expression ,",
    "the quantity @xmath28 represents the product of the density of states of the bethe lattice times the current vertex .",
    "this assumption insures that the f - sum rule associated with the optical conductivity holds , namely that its integral is proportional to the kinetic energy @xcite .     model at strong coupling ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "inset : temperature dependence of the absolute value of the kinetic energy ( @xmath30 in units of @xmath3 ) and of the staggered af magnetization @xmath31.,width=302 ]",
    "in fig .  [ tevolution ] we show our main result , namely the temperature - dependence of the optical conductivity as one cools the system from close to the nel temperature down to low temperature , in a regime of strong correlations , i.e. , @xmath32 . for temperatures slightly lower than @xmath6 , the optical conductivity resembles that of the paramagnetic insulator : it has a gap of order @xmath33 , and the absorption peak above the gap is essentially featureless . upon cooling ,",
    "two remarkable features characterize the optical signal : ( i ) the optical absorption strongly increases and ( ii ) a multi - peak structure emerges .",
    "such a structure becomes more and more visible as one goes down in temperature .",
    "note that these changes occur without a visible variation in the position of the absorption edge ( size of the gap ) .",
    "as discussed below , they should nevertheless be detectable by accurate experiments as a function of temperature .    later in this section",
    "we will explain the physical origin of the peaks in the optical conductivity by investigating the single particle spectral function and its evolution with @xmath4 . at this stage ,",
    "let us only stress that these peaks are by no means an artifact of the discretization required by our exact - diagonalization dmft solver@xcite . to better compare with experiments , we used a lorenztian broadening of @xmath34 to plot the optical conductivity .",
    "this value is small enough to distinguish the first peaks but also large enough to mimic the smearing of the multi - peak structure due to experimental resolution .",
    "we now discuss in more details the two key effects we mentioned before .    _",
    "i ) change of spectral weight through @xmath6 .",
    "_ the increase of spectral weight upon cooling is characteristic of a mott antiferromagnet at strong coupling .",
    "therefore it is the first gross feature one may look for in an optical experiment in order to establish whether the antiferromagnetism in the material is of strong - coupling nature , with preformed magnetic moments , or it is of weak - coupling nature , with a collective fermi - surface instability . to understand this",
    ", we can use the fact that the integral of the spectral weight is directly proportional to the kinetic energy . at strong coupling @xmath35",
    ", the ordered phase is stabilized by a gain in kinetic energy , associated to the establishment of long - range coherence of the local magnetic moments . in simple words",
    "the system gains kinetic energy by increasing the staggered magnetization : coherent hopping processes take place in a staggered spin background are favored if the spin pattern is as close as possible to the nel one @xcite .",
    "thus the lower the temperature , the larger the staggered magnetization and in turn the larger the spectral weight .",
    "if we consider instead the weak - coupling regime @xmath36 , a totally different mechanism for the stabilization of the ordered phase takes place . the af phase is stabilized by a ( small ) potential energy gain , as the onset of a non - zero order parameter is correctly described by the static mean field theory in this regime .",
    "these theoretical considerations are well confirmed by our numerical data shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ uevolution ] where we compare @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the kinetic energy of the ordered and disordered phase respectively .",
    "the complete evolution of the kinetic and potential energy as a function of @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "[ hierarchy ] . at strong coupling",
    "the antiferromagnetic order is clearly stabilized by the kinetic energy while at weak coupling ( @xmath39 ) the ordered phase is driven by the gain in potential energy . at intermediate values of the interaction strength , corresponding to the cross - over between weak and strong coupling , we have a mixed regime in which both energy differences are negative @xcite , i.e. where the onset of the af is stabilized by both kinetic and potential energy .",
    "_ ii ) spin - polaron peaks .",
    "_ to clarify the origin of the multi - peak structure , we compare in fig .",
    "[ uevolution ] the evolution from weak to strong coupling of the optical conductivity to that of the one - particle spectral function .",
    "it is evident that the multi - peak structure of the spectral function@xcite survives in the optical conductivity .",
    "the peculiar behavior of the spectral functions was first understood in a pioneering work by strack and vollhardt @xcite for the @xmath15 model in infinite dimensions ; and by some of us more recently within the hubbard model in the antiferromagnetic phase by means of dmft@xcite .",
    "the multiple peaks arise from string - like excitations associated with a hole moving in a nel background . in infinite dimensions",
    "the lifetime of such string excitations is infinite due to the absence of quantum spin - flip processes @xcite which would act as ` damage - repairing ' processes , which means that the heisenberg interaction reduces to the ising one ( see appendix [ sec : tj ] for further details ) .",
    "this results in the formation of coherent but heavy quasiparticles , `` dressed '' by a spinon cloud which is commonly called a `` spin - polaron '' .    the formation of the spin - polaron can be described only using methods ( such as dmft ) that go beyond the static mean field of a spin - density wave in the mean - field hartree - fock approximation .",
    "this is illustrated in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ uevolution ] , where we compare the evolution with @xmath4 of the dynamical ( red line ) and static mean - field ( green line ) results for the electron - removal spectrum .",
    "one clearly sees that the only feature of the static mean - field ( hartree - fock ) calculation is a slater - like single peak centered around @xmath40 .",
    "the peak has weight @xmath41 and its width is given by @xmath1 , i.e. the width shrinks to 0 as @xmath42 upon increasing @xmath4 . in the dynamical mean - field calculation , instead , the weight of the lowest lying excitation is much smaller ( @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath44 ) and the remaining weight is transferred to the higher - energy peaks .",
    "this makes a total bandwidth of order @xmath45 rather then @xmath1 , resulting in a smaller gap compared to the hartree - fock calculations.@xcite .",
    "this is why the gap in fig .  [ tevolution ] is of order @xmath33 , while it would be exactly @xmath4 within static mean - field theory .    in the @xmath15 model in infinite dimensions ( as well as in the hubbard model within af - dmft ,",
    "up to higher - order corrections in @xmath46 ) the position of the peaks can be analytically expressed through the zeros of the airy functions @xcite and the spacing between them goes as @xmath47 . as we will also discuss in section [ sec : concl ] these analytic expressions hold strictly only in infinite dimensions .",
    "hence the applicability of our results to real materials , and in particular the emergence of spin - polaron peaks , strongly relies on the assumption that it is possible to neglect the quantum spin - flip processes . in principle",
    "this is not guaranteed for finite dimensional systems , therefore one may expect some of the peaks to broaden or even to be washed out , due to the coupling to _ dispersive _ spin waves @xcite . on the other hand , recent sophisticated calculations for the two - dimensional @xmath15 model",
    "give clear evidence for the survival of the first one or two spin - polaron peaks with a similar separation as in the infinite - dimensional calculation @xcite .",
    "furthermore the case of a double layer antiferromagnet was recently considered in ref . .",
    "there , it is shown that the inter - layer exciton made of one hole and one doublon in each layer displays confinement effects when the inter - layer coupling is smaller than the intra - layer one .",
    "in such a situation , the spin - polaron excitations discussed here may become particularly relevant .    when considering three dimensional cases , where dmft is typically more accurate and finite - dimensionality effects are definitively weaker than in two dimensions@xcite , spin - polaron features are expected to be even more visible . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss indeed the relevance of our results for the three dimensional manganite lasrmno@xmath0 .",
    "on the basis of the previous discussion , the ideal material for the observation of the temperature evolution predicted above would be a completely isotropic three - dimensional mott antiferromagnet .",
    "to our knowledge the most relevant set of measurements in this respect is that by gssling , _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite on lasrmno@xmath0 , a three - dimensional @xmath48-type layered antiferromagnetic material with @xmath49k , while we are not aware of similar studies as a function of temperature on @xmath50-type antiferromagnets , which would be the closest realization of our large - coordination results . in fig .",
    "[ exp ] we show the data of ref . for the optical conductivity of lasrmno@xmath0 along the @xmath51 axis at different temperatures .",
    "the two main structures around 3.5 ev and 4.5 ev have been explained in terms of multiplet split transitions from a @xmath52 to a @xmath53 configuration of the mn .",
    "our main interest instead is focused on the fine structure arising upon cooling on top of both of these main structures .    in the light of our theoretical analysis",
    ", we can directly relate this observation with the physics of the spin - polarons described in the previous section .",
    "since the two structures are well separated , we shall make a simplifying assumption ( not meant to be quantitative , but sufficient to reveal the main qualitative aspect of the phenomenon ) .",
    "namely , we shall assume that we can adopt for each @xmath54 transition a simple single - band hubbard model description .",
    "since the separation between the multiplet peaks is larger than the energy scale associated with the spin - polaron excitations , we expect to be able to detect the above - mentioned increase of spectral weight around each of the main absorption peaks and the consequent appearance of spin - polaron structures when going below the nel temperature .",
    "all curves below @xmath6 display , in the same region , a very similar low - frequency tail ( below @xmath55  ev ) while in that region the higher - temperature measurements show a gradual increase of spectral weight that we attribute to a more standard thermal broadening effect .",
    "it is likely that such thermal effects are visible also in the low - energy multiplet peak at 3.5 ev , which lies closer to this tail .",
    "this makes this spectral feature less visible with a first distinguishable excitation shifting with temperature unlike what happens for the second multiplet structure at 4.5 ev .",
    "we focus therefore on the high - energy spectral structure around 4.5 ev , which seems to be unaffected by the temperature broadening of the low - frequency data , and we zoom the plot to focus on this feature . in order to highlight the temperature effect , we display in fig .",
    "[ exp_zoom ] the difference between the optical conductivity at a given temperature and the conductivity at the highest measured temperature ( 300k ) .",
    "[ exp_zoom ] and its theoretical counterpart ( fig .",
    "[ theo_zoom ] ) endorse our physical interpretation of the peaks in the optical signal .",
    "although the frequency grid in the experimental data is 0.05 ev , at least two well - spaced peak - structures emerge below @xmath6 and , as expected within our spin - polaron picture , the lower the temperature the weaker the temperature dependence becomes .",
    "indeed between 52 and 15k there is hardly any difference in the optical conductivity in this frequency region , as one can expect from the behavior of the staggered magnetization ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ tevolution ] ) , which is almost saturated far below @xmath6 .",
    "the appearance of the spin - polaron fine structures become clear below @xmath49k . yet",
    ", the polaronic features start to be visible already in the 150k curve .",
    "we attribute this to fluctuation effects above @xmath6 : even if long - range order is not yet fully developed , a sufficiently long coherence length of the spin - spin correlations is enough to sustain a non - fully developed spin - polaron mechanism",
    ".    similar features as the ones we have described are present in the optical absorption of another material : kcuf@xmath56 . for temperatures lower than the magnetic ordering temperature of this compound a multi - peak structure",
    "is indeed observed ( see fig .",
    "2b of ref . ) , for which an interpretation in terms of spin - waves has been given .",
    "we have therefore found in nature what we expect from our model calculation : a clear signature of antiferromagnetism arising from strong correlations in the optical conductivity of a strongly correlated material which emerges as the system is cooled below @xmath6 . if the material is sufficiently three - dimensional and if the resolution of the experiment is good enough , a clear signal with a multi - peak structure can be observed .",
    "another way of revealing the same effect would be to compare the increase of spectral weight to the measured staggered magnetization as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "[ sec : concl ]    we have calculated the optical conductivity of a strongly correlated antiferromagnet described by the hubbard or the @xmath15 model . within dynamical mean - field theory , we have shown that the optical conductivity is characterized by the presence of equally spaced spin - polaron peaks which appear right below the nel temperature and become more and more pronounced as the temperature is reduced . the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering is stabilized by a kinetic energy gain in strong coupling superexchange magnets , while at weak - coupling antiferromagnetism is due to fermi - surface nesting and it is stabilized by a static mean - field like potential energy gain .    in the strong coupling regime , the sharp peaks associated to spin - polarons originate from string - like excitation created by the motion of a hole in an antiferromagnetic background , and we can safely distinguish them from artificially sharp peaks characteristic of exact diagonalization solutions of dmft .    even if our formal derivation of the spin polaron peak relies on the infinite - coordination limit in which dmft becomes exact , we expect at least part of these features to survive in finite dimensions , and in particular in the three dimensional case , in which dmft typically proves accurate @xcite .",
    "we notice that at least the lowest - energy excitation peak is found also in two dimensions , as shown by different approaches@xcite , testifying that the physics behind our dmft results survives when the large dimensionality limit is far .",
    "if we look for experimental realizations of this scenario , we should take into account temperature effects and the finite experimental resolution , which can further smear out some of the fine structures . in this light , it is remarkable that an experimental study on lamnsro@xmath0@xcite reveals a multi - peak structure whose form and temperature behavior are in very good agreement with our calculations on top of the multiplet structure .",
    "moreover , considering the recent work by rademaker _",
    "@xcite , optical spectroscopy performed along the @xmath57-axis in layered systems may be a promising tool to detect and investigate the occurrence of the spin - polaron physics .",
    "an even stronger signatures of the spin - polaron effects are to be expected in three dimensional correlated materials which present a three - dimensional @xmath50-type antiferromagnetism , like srmno@xmath56 , camno@xmath56 , bamno@xmath56 , calling for future ir - spectroscopy investigations of the pm - af transitions in these compounds .    _",

    "the quantum spin - fluctuations associated to the term proportional to @xmath61 of the su(2)-symmetric heisenberg interaction are completely frozen . in other words , the heisenberg coupling of the @xmath15 hamiltonian",

    "in fact , any non - retraceable path is associated with an higher - energy cost , as the hole movement would result in a path of misaligned spins in the af - nel background .",
    "this implies that the geometry of the underlying lattice becomes irrelevant in @xmath65 : if only retraceable paths matter , every geometry becomes topologically equivalent to the bethe lattice , a tree - structure which by construction only allows for retraceable paths .    as a consequence at @xmath59",
    "the discrete energy levels characterizing the analysis of one - hole dynamics in the af - nel background of the @xmath15 model can be related to the simple quantum mechanical problem of one particle in a step potential @xmath66 , being @xmath67 the number of misaligned spin created by the hopping processes of the hole .",

    "complications arise at finite @xmath14 : in particular point 2 is in principle no longer valid , as thermal fluctuations will reduce the value of the staggered magnetization , allowing for a contribution of non - retraceable paths to the local physics .",
    "however , we can easily circumvent this problem , if we consider explicitly the bethe lattice case for our dmft calculations .",
    "this is , on the one hand , a reasonable choice , as the finite bandwidth of the bethe lattice reflects more directly the realistic situation of finite bandwidths in real materials , and , on the other hand , it preserves by construction the validity of the `` retraceable path '' condition at all temperatures .",
    "working with the bethe lattice allows , in turn , for a straightforward generalization of the continued - fraction expression for @xmath64 to the finite temperature case , along the lines of the exact derivation of ref .. specifically , one can easily generalize eq .",

    "this result can be easily understood , because the heisenberg interaction term , which is _ non - local _ in the site indices @xmath12,@xmath85 , becomes irrelevant due to the @xmath65 scaling in the paramagnetic phase ( i.e. , for @xmath86 ) and , therefore , for @xmath83 one gets the same spectral function of the case @xmath87 , independently from the actual value of @xmath1 .      after having recalled how to solve exactly the dmft problem of one hole in the @xmath15 model",
    ", we will discuss here how to approximate the dmft self - energy for the hubbard model in the limit of intermediate - to - strong coupling by exploiting this solution .",
    "in fact , it is known @xcite that in the limit @xmath35 the hubbard model can be mapped onto a corresponding @xmath15 model with @xmath88 .",
    "when using the @xmath15 results to approximate the hubbard dmft self - energy or the @xmath89integrated spectral and green functions in the limit of @xmath35 , one should not forget that the exact `` mapping '' between the two models is obtained by projecting out the doubly occupied sites .",
    "this evidently means that the @xmath15 model can not describe the whole frequency range of the hubbard model , even in the limit of @xmath35 , but , at most , only `` half '' of it .",
    "this becomes quite obvious , when explicitly considering the @xmath89integrated spectral functions : the gap between the hubbard bands is originated by the energy difference ( @xmath90 ) between single occupied and double occupied / empty sites , but this energy difference is exactly what is projected out in the mapping onto the @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , when computing the dmft green function for one _ hole _ in the @xmath15 model , the associated spectral function will be related to electron - removal ( @xmath92 , i.e. photoemission ) part of the @xmath93integrated spectral function of the hubbard model : more precisely , taking into account the above mentioned energy shift of order @xmath4 ( not explicitly included in the @xmath15 hamiltonian ) , it will correspond to the _ lower _ hubbard band .",

    "a word of caution is due at this point : as the value of @xmath70 is defined in terms of the staggered magnetization @xmath73 , the latter naturally represents the most appropriate `` link '' between the dmft @xmath15 and hubbard green functions .",
    "in fact , in using the @xmath15 approximation for the dmft spectra of hubbard model , one should keep in mind that the mapping is rigorously exact only in the limit of @xmath101 , otherwise , corrections @xmath102 have to be expected : from a more physical perspective , the presence of doubly occupied / empty sites in the ground state of the hubbard model stays indeed _ finite _ ( though becoming smaller and smaller for increasing @xmath4 ) at any value of the hubbard interaction . as a consequence , for any given set of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath14 , the staggered magnetization of the hubbard model will be slightly _ lower _ than that for the @xmath15 model , as it is also found in our dmft data , plotted in fig .",

    "remarkably the `` magnitude '' of @xmath116 , e.g. if quantified by the value of its frequency integral , is not particularly large for low-@xmath14 , implying a certain degree of `` coherence '' of the spin polaron excitations in this regime@xcite .",

    "this can be compared with the exact solution of the atomic limit ( @xmath123 ) , for which one can easily compute the green function@xcite , e.g. for the spin @xmath124 sector @xmath125 and , from this ( and the corresponding @xmath126 ) , calculate the self - energy @xmath127 \\label{eqapp : gat2}\\ ] ] which evidently displays a peak in its imaginary part located at @xmath128 ( i.e , a `` softening '' for increasing @xmath14/decreasing @xmath31 ) of weight @xmath129 $ ] ( i.e. , of increasing strength for increasing @xmath14/decreasing @xmath31 ) . at @xmath130 ,",

    "after having discussed the results obtained by approximating the hubbard dmft self - energy starting from the @xmath15 one , and having noted that for @xmath135 its structure is coincident with that of the exact hubbard model within small corrections ( roughly of order @xmath136 ) , here we will explicitly compare dmft data for the optical conductivity in order to show the accuracy of our @xmath15 approximation for the quantity we are more interested in this paper .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ hubb - tj ] our numerical data for the optical conductivity of the af - phase , namely for @xmath29 at @xmath59 calculated inserting the dmft hubbard self - energy and the correspondent @xmath15 approximated one in eq .",
    "( [ optcond ] ) . at @xmath59 , in fact ,",
    "the possibility to use the lanczos as an impurity solver , allows for a better resolution of the multiple peak structure of the hubbard self - energy and , therefore , for a better test case to evaluate the accuracy of the @xmath15 approximation for the optical conductivity of the hubbard model .",
    "in fact , while lanczos already allows a larger number of bath sites than the full exact diagonalization , in the af case for @xmath115 the computational cost of increasing the number of bath sites can be further reduced .",
    "specifically it is reasonable to assume that , in the af ground state , also the bath electrons will be almost fully polarized .",
    "bearing in mind that the total number of electrons with spin up ( @xmath137 ) and with spin down ( @xmath138 ) are good quantum numbers , the hamiltonian can be decomposed in smaller blocks , each associated with a _ spin sector _",
    ", whose size is given by : @xmath139 where @xmath140 represents the total number of electron levels , and @xmath141 the dimension of the hilbert space associated with @xmath142 electrons of spin @xmath25 .",
    "since the bath is strongly polarized , in the lanczos algorithm we only need to take into account those spin sectors in which the big majority of the fermions of the bath has either spin up or spin down .",
    "that means that we only need to diagonalize the smallest blocks composing the hamiltonian .",
    "this is very different from the pm phase , where we need to take into account mainly those sectors where the number of spin up fermions and spin down fermions is comparable , and hence the size of the matrices to diagonalize is much bigger . in practice , exploiting the property of a fully polarized bath , in the af phase we can reach with a reasonable computational effort a number of electrons as high as @xmath143 , while in the pm case we could reach only @xmath144    going back to the analysis of fig .",
    "[ figapp : magn ] , our data show that , at @xmath145 , the overall agreement between the peaky structure of the optical conductivity of the @xmath15 approximation and that of the hubbard model is rather good , as both the peak positions and intensity are well captured also in the @xmath91 scheme .",
    "this result justifies , for these values of @xmath4 , the usage of the dmft solution of the one - hole problem in the @xmath146 model as an accurate approximation , e.g. , also when considering the finite @xmath14 regime .",
    "in fact , when increasing @xmath14 , lanczos or full ed solution of dmft are no longer accurate enough for the computation of multi - peak spectral functions with sufficient resolution .",
