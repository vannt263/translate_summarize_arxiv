    "much works have been devoted @xcite to possible choice of @xmath4 , and it has been conjectured that particular choice give rise to the tachyon vacuum . however , direct derivation of the gauge invariant observables has not yet available since the solution is identity based , i.e. , it is defined on an infinitesimally thin strip in sliver frame . in this paper",

    "we conclude in section [ 234330_20jul14 ] and give discussions .    _",
    "note added : _ while revising this manuscript , we found two papers @xcite which deal with similar subjects with our paper .",
    "we begin with a review of the formalism developed by maccaferri @xcite , on which we heavily rely in this paper .",
    "the formalism allows us to map an identity based solution to a wedge based solution whose gauge invariant observable is defined by a cft correlator on a cylinder with nonzero width .",
    "let @xmath0 be a `` seed '' solution of the equation of motion @xmath7 .",
    "then , a new wedge based solution is given by , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are familiar elements of the @xmath6 subalgebra and @xmath11 is the deformed generator defined by @xmath12 note that @xmath11 is an element of deformed algebra , @xmath13 the solution ( [ 065354_7jul14 ] ) is gauge equivalent to @xmath0 since it can be written as a @xmath0 dependent gauge transformation @xmath14 where @xmath15",
    ". notable feature of this prescription is that gauge invariant observables are expressed as a difference between those of the erler - schnabl solution @xcite defined on perturbative vacuum and deformed background by @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "for example , the gauge invariant overlap for closed string vertex operator @xmath16 is given by =    \\mathrm{tr } [ v\\psi]$ ] and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a weight @xmath19 vertex operator in matter sector . ]",

    "while @xmath0 can be arbitrary solution , we will consider identity based @xmath0 .",
    "next , we apply the maccaferri s formulas to the identity based solutions in @xmath6 subalgebra @xcite to evaluate gauge invariant observables .",
    "we refer the classification given in @xcite where the author identified three kinds of gauge orbits , perturbative vacuum , tachyon vacuum , and the mnt ghost brane . in following sections",
    ", we deal with perturbative vacuum and tachyon vacuum which are relevant to later discussions for the tt solution .",
    "the `` perturbative vacuum '' solution is the well - known brst exact string field , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a real constant is excluded because we can not construct the similarity transformation discussed in this section .",
    "it also should be noted that this string field is a part of the mnt ghost brane solution @xcite which is not gauge equivalent to the perturbative vacuum . ] .",
    "this solution can be written in pure gauge form @xmath27 where @xmath28 the deformed generator for this solution is found to be @xmath29 it is not difficult to see that a @xmath30-th power of @xmath11 becomes @xmath31 therefore , a function of @xmath11 defined by a power series also satisfies @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the formulas ( [ eq : k^n ] ) and ( [ 083455_4jul14 ] ) can also be explained by a gauge transformation @xmath34 since it acts on @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath35 in very simple manner , @xmath36    in order to evaluate the gauge invariant overlap , we apply ( [ 150935_7jul14 ] ) to the last term of ( [ 070004_7jul14 ] ) to obtain @xmath37 & =   \\mathrm{tr } \\left [ v u \\frac{1}{1+k_{\\lambda } } u^{-1 }      c u   u^{-1 } \\right ] \\\\ & = ( 1+\\lambda ) ^{-1 } \\mathrm{tr } \\left[u^{-1 }   v u \\frac{1}{1+k_{\\lambda } } c   \\right],\\label{192901_7jul14 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",

    "therefore the trace reduces to @xmath42 = \\mathrm{tr } \\left [ \\frac{1}{1+k } c   \\right ] .",

    "the obtained trace is just the gauge invariant observable for the erler - schnabl solution .",

    "again , this is exactly same as the first term of ( [ 072118_7jul14 ] )",
    ". therefore we obtain vanishing action .",
    "although we apply maccaferri s formulas for a demonstration , our result can be confirmed by direct evaluation of the original solution @xmath48 . plugging @xmath49 into ( [ 140810_7jul14 ] )",
    ", it is soon realized that the entire solution is nothing but a non - real form of the okawa solution @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is @xmath52 the homotopy operator for this solution @xmath53 indicates that the brst cohomology is nontrivial due to @xmath54 dependence in ( [ 091353_10jul14 ] ) .",
    "clearly this is a wedge based perturbative vacuum solution according to the classification given in @xcite .",
    "next , we consider an identity based solution @xmath55 which is gauge equivalent to the wedge based tachyon vacuum solution .",
    "application of the maccaferri s formulas to ( [ 000137_21jul14 ] ) is straightforward since @xmath11 becomes constant as one can easily verify from ( [ 070858_7jul14 ] ) . in this case , @xmath56 and the piece of the solution which is relevant to the gauge invariant observables",
    "is given by @xmath57 the closed string overlap is given by @xmath58 =   \\mathrm{tr}_v [ \\psi_{es , k } ] -   \\frac{1}{2 } \\mathrm{tr}_v [ c ] .",
    "\\label{eq : giotach}\\ ] ] the last term in ( [ eq : giotach ] ) is a trace of identity based string field therefore can not be evaluated directly .",
    "we claim that this trace vanishes as explained below . while there could be several way to prove this , we follow the strategy employed to the case of the marginal deformation @xcite in which a contribution from the deformation @xmath59 is expressed as",
    "a path ordered exponential .",
    "more precisely , we apply the schwinger parametrization @xmath60 to the last term of ( [ eq : giotach ] ) .",
    "we regard @xmath61 as deformation for the original background . in present case ,",
    "@xmath62 commutes with @xmath9 , so path ordering is not necessary .",
    "expanding @xmath61 in @xmath9 and regard it as a sum of differentials on @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 then , second term of ( [ eq : giotach ] ) can be evaluated as @xmath65 \\notag \\\\ & =   \\mathrm{tr}_v[c ]   \\lim_{s \\rightarrow 1 }     ( s-1 ) \\int_{0}^{\\infty } dt e^{-2 t } t   \\notag   \\\\ & = 0,\\label{192743_22jul14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have scaled the correlation function on the cylinder in first line of ( [ 192743_22jul14 ] ) .",
    "then , only the first term of ( [ eq : giotach ] ) remains to give a same value as that of the erler - schnabl solution just expected .",
    "the classical action can be evaluated more straightforwardly by applying @xmath66 to ( [ 072118_7jul14 ] ) . in this case , last term in ( [ 072118_7jul14 ] ) vanishes trivially since it is just proportional to @xmath67 =    \\mathrm{tr } [ c^3]$]=0 $ ] . ]",
    ". therefore the value of the classical action also coincides with that of erler - schnabl solution .    again similar to the end of the former section , our result",
    "is confirmed by a form of the whole solution .",
    "plugging @xmath68 into ( [ 140810_7jul14 ] ) , one soon realize that the entire solution is nothing but a non - real form of the okawa solution @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath69 is just a product of @xmath70 and @xmath71 which define two okawa solutions @xmath72 and @xmath73 . according to the classification given in @xcite",
    ", this solution corresponds to tachyon vacuum since homotopy operator turns out to be @xmath74 which is proportional to that of erler - schnabl solution .",
    "hence brst cohomology for this solution is trivial .",
    "we would like to describe the takahashi - tanimoto ( tt ) scalar solution @xcite along the line with @xcite .",
    "the solution is written as @xmath75 here we follow the convention of @xcite , where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are identity based string fields rather than conformal fields in sliver frame @xcite .",
    "for example , the string field @xmath2 is defined by @xmath76 this description is very useful since @xmath2 obeys ope like equation and actually becomes a conformal field once inserted into the world sheet .",
    "the @xmath77 integration runs along the imaginary axis placed at the center of the infinitely thin vertical strip .",
    "the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 should be defined on the imaginary axis .",
    "they are not dependent and fixed by the equation of motion . in order to solve equation of motion for ( [ 070106_8jul14 ] )",
    ", we need to evaluate a product of line integrals .",
    "as shown in @xcite , one of the line integral in the product can be converted into a contour integral around other operator in line integral .",
    "for example , a cross terms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 is evaluated as follows : @xmath80 in the last line , we use the ope @xmath81 let us introduce a shorthand notation @xmath82 then , the result ( [ 051305_12jul14 ] ) is simply stated as @xmath83 in order to derive equation of motion , ope of between two @xmath84s @xmath85 is also required .",
    "then another formula follows , @xmath86 where primes denote @xmath77 derivative .",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 can also be evaluated by regarding @xmath89 .",
    "then the right hand side of the equation motion @xmath90 is reduced to a line integral of @xmath91 multiplied by @xmath92 therefore the equation of motion holds if @xmath4 and @xmath5 satisfy @xmath93 for given @xmath4 , @xmath5 is easily solved as @xmath94 in original tt paper @xcite , solutions for given @xmath4 have been considered . on the other hand , ( [ 094742_2jun14 ] ) can also be solved for given @xmath5 . in order to do this ,",
    "we write @xmath4 as @xmath95 then , ( [ 094742_2jun14 ] ) becomes much simpler @xmath96 which can be easily integrated as @xmath97 then @xmath4 is finally given by @xmath98 note that @xmath99 is defined up to an integration constant , which will be fixed later .",
    "let us now turn to the deformed generator @xmath100 , which is of our main interest , since it is required for the maccaferri s formulas ( [ 070004_7jul14 ] ) and ( [ 072118_7jul14 ] ) in order to evaluate the gauge invariant observables . from the opes",
    "@xmath101 one can derive @xmath102 here a term which is not convoluted with operator denotes a constant obtained by a line integral .",
    "for example , @xmath103 a sum of ( [ hb ] ) , ( [ 091626_10jul14 ] ) for @xmath104 and the original @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath11 , whose expression is @xmath105 it should be noted that @xmath11 is well defined if and only if the constant term @xmath106 is finite .",
    "this impose a constraint for possible choice of @xmath4 .",
    "let us first study perturbative vacuum solution .",
    "the result of section [ 060630_12jul14 ] for perturbative vacuum provides a hint to this problem . as similar to ( [ 150935_7jul14 ] ) , we expect that ( [ 091616_10jul14 ] ) is written as a similarity transformation , @xmath107 for tt solution , it turns out that the `` twisted '' conformal transformation realizes this : @xmath108 here @xmath109 is the twisted virasolo generator @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the ghost number current .",
    "central charge of the twisted cft is 24 therefore an ope between the energy momentum tensor with other operator involves an anomalous constant .",
    "a finite conformal map generated by @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 the details of a proof of ( [ 062321_12jul14 ] ) is shown in appendix [ 090840_10jul14 ] .",
    "the relation between @xmath4 in ( [ 091616_10jul14 ] ) and the conformal transformation @xmath114 is also given in appendix : @xmath115 this relation arrows us to write a twisted conformal transformation of @xmath9 again as a line integral in the new coordinate @xmath116 .",
    "we require that the conformal map @xmath114 leaves imaginary axis invariant . in terms of a parameter @xmath117 along the imaginary axis , this means @xmath118 we can further restrict @xmath116 such that @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "then , @xmath114 is an odd function under the former condition .",
    "we proceed evaluation of gauge invariant observables . for the gauge invariant overlap",
    ", we have @xmath121   = \\mathrm{tr } \\left[u^{-1 } v u     \\frac{1}{1+k } u^{-1 } c u    \\right].\\label{080121_12jul14}\\ ] ] the important aspect of the twisted conformal transformation is that @xmath35 transforms as weight 0 tensor .",
    "therefore , the @xmath35 insertion in ( [ 080121_12jul14 ] ) left invariant , @xmath122 by requiring @xmath123 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transformation of the closed string vertex operator @xmath16 involves a conformal factor since transformation of matter vertex operator @xmath18 is not affected by the twist .",
    "we would like to impose further condition on @xmath114 which leaves @xmath16 invariant .",
    "since @xmath16 is located at imaginary infinity , we require @xmath124 under these conditions for @xmath116 , the matter vertex operator @xmath18 produces no conformal factor , and the trace is reduced to the erler - schnabl s one , @xmath121   = \\mathrm{tr}_v",
    "\\left [     \\frac{1}{1+k } c    \\right].\\ ] ] as similar to the case of section [ 060630_12jul14 ] , this cancels first term of ( [ 070004_7jul14 ] ) therefore the gauge invariant overlap vanishes as expected .",
    "we note that the boundary conditions for @xmath116 , @xmath125 can be translated into the boundary condition for @xmath126 according to ( [ 151925_19jul14 ] ) as @xmath127 this is the mid point condition which has been used to define tt solution @xcite .",
    "evaluation of the action is more straightforward .",
    "the second trace of ( [ 072118_7jul14 ] ) is @xmath128 = \\mathrm{tr}\\left [ \\frac{1}{1+k }   c    \\frac{1}{1+k }   c   k    c\\right]\\ ] ] where we use the @xmath34 invariance of @xmath35 in right hand side .",
    "this again cancels the first term of ( [ 072118_7jul14 ] ) therefore yields vanishing action .    as an explicit example of the perturbative vacuum solution",
    ", we consider a normalized gaussian @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a real constant .",
    "it is realized that this @xmath4 and also @xmath5 dump well at imaginary infinity .",
    "the anomalous constants in @xmath11 , i.e. , the last two terms ( [ 091616_10jul14 ] ) are also finite .",
    "therefore we expect that the solution has finite contraction with wedge based states . in this example , the finite conformal map @xmath114 is only available as a numerical solution of the differential equation ( [ 151925_19jul14 ] ) .",
    "we next study tachyon vacuum in tt solution .",
    "let us recall identity based solutions in @xmath6 subalgebra we discussed in section [ 060630_12jul14 ] .",
    "there , a crucial difference between tachyon vacuum solution and perturbative vacuum solution is the existence of isolated @xmath35 term .",
    "therefore , we consider a one parameter family such that @xmath5 in ( [ 070106_8jul14 ] ) approaches to delta function . in such case ,",
    "the second term of ( [ 070106_8jul14 ] ) localizes to the boundary .",
    "we then begin from the normalized gaussian @xmath5 : @xmath131 where @xmath132 limit gives delta function .",
    "corresponding @xmath4 can be obtained from the formula ( [ 130621_23jul14 ] ) : @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the imaginary error function .",
    "an integration constant in @xmath99 is fixed so that @xmath4 becomes an even function .     at @xmath136 . ]    as seen from fig .",
    "[ 141024_23jul14 ] , @xmath4 is very close to @xmath137 and there is a small peek around @xmath138 . as @xmath130 become smaller , the horizontal line further approaches to @xmath137 and the peak become negligible .",
    "thus in the @xmath132 limit , @xmath139 therefore , the @xmath140 terms approaches to zero in this limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the anomalous constant @xmath141 just becomes @xmath142 , since @xmath143 contribution is just an integration of the normalized gaussian , and @xmath144 contribution becomes zero since it is boundary values of @xmath145 which vanishes at imaginary infinity .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath146 in @xmath132 limit .",
    "this limit just corresponds @xmath56 for the tachyon vacuum solution @xmath147 .",
    "then , gauge invariant observables are evaluated in exactly same manner as in section [ 060630_12jul14 ] .",
    "this result serves an analytic proof that particular tt scalar solution corresponds to the tachyon vaccum and successfully derives gauge invariant observables .",
    "finally , we note that this example can not be written in pure gauge form derived in section [ 203431_23jul14 ] .",
    "at least @xmath148 limit corresponds to a singular conformal map , since ( [ 151925_19jul14 ] ) means @xmath149 in this limit , therefore the image of @xmath77 shrinks to a point .",
    "we have seen that there is a special limit of tt scalar solution in which the deformed generator @xmath11 becomes constant . in such limit , gauge invariant observables can be evaluated analytically with the help of maccaferri s formula .",
    "we also find a twisted conformal transformation which maps @xmath9 to @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to the perturbative vacuum .",
    "apparently much aspects to be understood .",
    "we have not yet identified which condition for @xmath4 distinguish between perturbative vacuum and tachyon vacuum .",
    "it is also to be identified that whether the example given in section [ 200607_23jul14 ] for finite @xmath130 corresponds to tachyon vacuum .",
    "it will require a direct evaluation of a trace which is more complicated than the marginal case .",
    "another important feature of the maccaferri s formalism is the appearance of the kos like boundary condition changing ( bcc ) operator . in our case of tt scalar",
    ", the corresponding bcc operator can be written @xmath150 and @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the bosonized ghost .",
    "remembering @xmath153 , one can see the formal resemblance of our solution to boundary deformation .",
    "our solution looks as if it describes a `` boundary '' deformation by the ghost number current . since the ghost current has singular self ope , regularization by @xmath154",
    "is required .",
    "the tachyon vacuum would be understood as a very singular limit of such `` deformation '' .",
    "such interpretation of the tachyon vacuum by singular deformation will be useful tool , since it serves `` boundary '' cft description for the string field theory around the tachyon vacuum , which might not exist in usual sence .",
    "in such context , @xmath155 should be understood as `` boundary removing '' operator .",
    "however , it is not clear whether above speculation works .",
    "the solution does not look similar to the kos solution @xcite since the ghost number current , bosonized ghost , and the bcc operator belong to the ghost sector so the solution behaves quite differently from the marginal solution made from pure matter current .",
    "it will also be interesting to apply the method developed in @xcite in order to render singular ghost current ope regular one .",
    "in this section we prove the formula ( [ 062321_12jul14 ] ) , @xmath156 where @xmath34 is the twisted conformal transformation : @xmath157 in order to evaluate left hand side of ( [ 085944_23jul14 ] ) , we divide @xmath9 as @xmath158 and evaluate each term .",

    "@xmath35 is the central charge and @xmath160 is the parameter that specifies conformal weights of ghosts .",
    "a sum of ( [ 091455_23jul14 ] ) and ( [ 200154_8jul14 ] ) gives a finite transformation of @xmath161 : @xmath162 we have applied @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the last line .",
    "then an integral of ( [ 201610_8jul14 ] ) with respect to @xmath77 gives transformation of @xmath9 .",
