    "in order to form the h - r diagram for the cluster populations we have made use of the model atmosphere broad - band colours , bolometric corrections and temperatures of bessell , castelli & plez @xcite . for stars of high effective temperature the @xmath8 colours fail to provide good temperature indicators ( massey et al.1995 ) and consequently we have used spectral types for temperature determination where possible for stars earlier than b2 .",

    "@xcite and denoyelle et al.@xcite .",
    "this is in disagreement with the findings of marco & bernabeu @xcite who , from an examination of the average ms locus of both clusters , find that @xmath2 persei with a log age of 7.3 is older than @xmath3 persei ( with a log age of 7.0 ) .",
    "marco & bernabeu go further to propose three epochs of star formation within @xmath2 & @xmath3 persei at log ages 7.0 , 7.15 and 7.3 .",
    "we propose that the analysis of marco & bernabeu @xcite is largely an over - interpretation of the available data .",
    "our expanded dataset does not show any evidence for an age difference between the two clusters or multiple epochs of star formation",
    ".    it would be useful to consider the mass functions of the two clusters together with the age structure of the surrounding field . at present",
    "this is not possible .",
    "the existing proper motion study of mumimov @xcite is limited in magnitude ( @xmath48 ) and spatial extent ( only the cluster cores are covered ) .",
    "there is no photometric method for distinguishing the cluster members from members of the surrounding association due to the close affinity in age of the cluster and field populations .",
    "such analysis awaits more detailed proper motion studies .",
    "in figure [ beffig ] we present the be fraction amongst ms b stars ( to @xmath49=+0.25 @xmath50 b9v schmidt - kaler 1982 ) within the field of the association .",
    "the resulting distribution peaks at a fraction of 36% over the 0.5 mag .",
    "interval centered on @xmath51=7.5 which is in the vicinity of the ms turnoff for the association .",
    "the peak in be fraction seen at the ms terminus is also seen in several young clusters of the magellanic clouds ( keller et al.2000 and johnson et al .",
    "2001 ) . yet studies of the be fraction within the galactic and lmc field ( see zorec & briot 1997 and keller et al .",
    "1999b respectively ) show a more or less uniform proportion of around 15% over the spectral range b0-b5 . to account for the observed difference in be fraction between the cluster and field environment we propose a scenario of evolutionary enhancement in",
    "the be phenomenon .",
    "our scenario utilises the one clear difference between the cluster and field populations , namely the age spread within each population .",
    "we consider a phase of enhancement of the be phenomenon which occurs over an interval of the ms lifetime towards the end of the ms .",
    "the small age spread within the cluster population at the luminosity of the cluster ms terminus places the majority of the stars within the interval of be enhancement .",
    "a peak in the be fraction results at luminosities near the ms terminus and diminishes at lower luminosities as fewer stars reside within the age range of enhancement . at lower luminosities a population of",
    "be stars remains .",
    "these stars are those with sufficient initial angular momentum to commence the be phase . within the field population , which possesses a more uniform spread of ages for stars on the ms at a given mass ,",
    "we see essentially the time - average of the proportion of be stars .",
    "this is lower than that seen in the cluster and more - or - less uniform with luminosity .",
    "the tendency for there to be a higher be star fraction near the main - sequence turnoff is consistent with the rapid rotation hypothesis for be star formation .",
    "the evolution of rotating stars has been examined by endal & sofia @xcite and recently by heger et al .",
    "@xcite and meynet & maeder @xcite .",
    "these models explicitly follow the radial exchange of angular momentum with evolution .",
    "the quantitative details of the evolution of the equatorial surface velocity ( @xmath52 ) depend critically on mass loss .",
    "taking the example from meynet & maeder @xcite , a 20m@xmath11 star with an initial @xmath52 of 300 kms@xmath14 drops to @xmath10120 kms@xmath14 by the ms turnoff .",
    "on the other hand a 12m@xmath11 star drops from 300 kms@xmath14 to @xmath10200 kms@xmath14 due to a substantially smaller mass lose rate .",
    "the evolution of @xmath53 , the surface angular velocity as a fraction of the critical angular velocity ( i.e.  the velocity at which the equatorial escape velocity drops to zero ) , is dependent on the treatment of redistribution of angular momentum within the stellar interior and of the effects of rotationally induced mixing .",
    "heger et al .  and",
    "meynet & maeder implement different treatments of the above but the qualitative conclusions are concordant : for stars less than 15m@xmath11 , @xmath53 increases towards the end of the ms lifetime .",
    "meynet & maeder examine the case of a 20m@xmath11 star with a range of initial velocities .",
    "they find that the decrease in the surface @xmath52 is larger for larger initial velocities .",
    "this is due to the high stellar mass loss rates for rapid rotators . at lower masses",
    "we expect this behavior to be modified by lower mass loss rates .",
    "the models of endal and sofia examine the rotational velocity evolution of a 5m@xmath11 star .",
    "they find that stars commencing their main - sequence lives with relatively slow angular velocity remain slow rotators throughout the whole of the main - sequence evolutionary phase ( although there is a marked increase in angular velocity of all stars during the core contraction phase associated with exhaustion of hydrogen in the core , this evolutionary phase is far too short to account for the observed proportion of be stars as was proposed by schmidt - kaler @xcite and recently by bessell & wood @xcite . thus slow rotators will never evolve into be stars .",
    "in contrast to the slow rotators , the models of endal and sofia show that stars commencing their lives with an angular velocity greater than 56 - 76% of the critical breakup velocity @xmath54 spin up to the critical velocity over a moderate fraction of the main - sequence lifetime . in a cluster where some fraction of the stars is formed with angular velocity greater than @xmath1050% of @xmath54 ,",
    "those stars nearer the main - sequence turnoff are more likely to be be stars since they will have been more spun up by evolution than the less luminous stars that have not evolved as far through the main - sequence phase .",
    "this process could provide the mechanism of be enhancement required to explain the concentration of be stars to the main - sequence tip .",
    "numerous studies have indicated the importance of rotation within massive stars ( e.g. langer & heger 2000 and meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",
    "rotationally induced mixing has been shown to be able to produce significant evolutionary and surface abundance changes .",
    "observational evidence for the importance of rotation is growing , within @xmath2 & @xmath3 persei in particular , the study of vrancken et al .",
    "@xcite provides a detailed chemical analysis of eight b1 - b2 stars within the vicinity of the ms turnoff .",
    "they find , from the deduced hr diagram , a degree of extension to the end of the ms which is in agreement with evolutionary models which incorporate rotation .",
    "we have obtained @xmath0 and h@xmath1 photometry over a 37@xmath4 1  field around the double cluster @xmath2 & @xmath3 persei . we have formed a spatial description of the reddening throughout the field .",
    "we have found that the clusters share a common distance modulus of 11.75@xmath50.05 and possess ages of log age(yr)=7.1@xmath50.1 .",
    "our study comprises a uniform survey for be stars within the region .",
    "using the @xmath6@xmath7h@xmath1 colour as a measure of the strength of h@xmath1 emission we have identified 33 be stars , 8 of which were previously unknown .",
    "the fraction of be stars to total b stars shows a maximum at the end of the ms .",
    "similar behaviour is seen in the be population of young clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this feature suggests a evolutionary enhancement in the be phenomenon towards the end of the ms lifetime which we suggest is a consequence of rotational spin - up over the ms lifetime .",
