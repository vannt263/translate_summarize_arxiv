    "since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) one has considered the possibility of extending one - mode models to two or more modes @xcite .",
    "this raises the issue of the relative phase between modes . as indicated by several authors",
    "@xcite , a two - well bec may exhibit features that are not covered by the semiclassical description in terms of the gross - pitaevski equation .",
    "these features are significant at low particle numbers and for strong interactions . in previous work",
    ", we discussed some aspects of the dynamics of a two - well bec in the strong - interaction regime @xcite .",
    "this is close to the experimental situation for a bec in a double - well trap , designed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a sensitive way to probe the properties of a bec in a double - well potential with strong interatomic interactions is to look for resonant behavior when a parameter of the system is periodically modulated .",
    "the response of the system may be expected to be very sensitive to the value of the modulation frequency in the neighborhood of a resonance .",
    "a periodic perturbation can be implemented in various ways .",
    "one example would be periodically modulating the trapping potential .",
    "salmond et al @xcite study a numerical model of a double - well potential with periodically modulated coupling between the wells .",
    "this semiclassical analysis reveals the existence of uncoupled regions with chaotic and regular motion .",
    "the inclusion of the quantum nature of the evolution leads to transitions between these regions .",
    "another type of periodic perturbation can be imposed by periodically modulating the energy difference between the ground states in the two wells .",
    "periodic modulations are known to give rise to dynamical localization in some cases .",
    "this effect has been widely discussed in the literature in the case a particle in a periodic potential , such as an electron in a crystal or an atom in an optical lattice @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when the particle also feels a uniform force in addition to the lattice potential ( a tilted optical lattice ) , it is found to have an infinite discrete set of equidistant energy levels , with a level separation that is determined by the strength of the uniform force @xcite .",
    "a variation of the magnitude of the uniform force affects the phase of the state .",
    "so , when this magnitude is periodically modulated , resonances may be expected .",
    "the population in one well is described by adding the amplitudes for arriving at this well from various other wells , each one with a different phase shift . in the long time limit ,",
    "when the time of observation is long compared to the period of the modulation , this gives rise to destructive interference , leading to a suppression of the net tunneling rate .",
    "hence , the asymptotic distribution over the wells coincides with the initial one , and dynamical localization has been realized .",
    "another example of dynamical localization arises for a single two - level atom in a driving field with a periodically modulated detuning @xcite . for certain ratios of the modulation frequency and the strength of the field",
    ", the atom is localized in its ground state .",
    "the time scale is restricted by the modulation frequency .    in the present case of a bec in a two - well potential with a fixed total number of atoms ,",
    "the state space is finite dimensional . in the su(2 )",
    "representation of the operator algebra , the hamiltonian has a quadratic term due to the interatomic interactions .",
    "so , in this sense the system is quite different from that of an atom in a tilted lattice , with its infinite number of states and a hamiltonian that is linear in the su(2 ) operators . still , there are some obvious similarities : the discrete structure of the energy and the presence of interatomic interactions and tunneling between wells as competing processes .",
    "therefore , we expect interesting effects also in the two - well case when the energy difference or the hopping between wells is periodically modulated . from a formal point of view , the analysis in the present paper may be regarded as a generalization of the process of dynamical localization for the hamiltonian with a quadratic term .",
    "specifically , this paper considers the possibilites of coherent control of a bec in a double - well potential by using any kind of time - periodic perturbation .",
    "we describe a bec in a double potential well in terms of a one - particle hamiltonian @xmath0 and a two - particle interaction @xmath1 .",
    "the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the the localized ground states in either well , with wave functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 . on the basis of the states @xmath2 and @xmath6 , the one - particle hamiltonian has the matrix elements @xmath7 in the case that @xmath8 , the coupling between the wells lifts their degeneracy , and creates an energy splitting @xmath9 between the even ground state @xmath10 and the odd excited state @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 when we restrict ourselves to these two states , the field operator in second quantization has the standard form    @xmath13    with @xmath14 the one - particle annihilation operator in the two states , which together with the corresponding creation operators obey the bosonic commutation rules .",
    "when we substitute this expression in the formal expression @xmath15 for the second - quantized hamiltonian , we find    @xmath16    where the indices @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , and the matrix elements are taken between the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24    at sufficiently low energy , the two particle interaction is well approximated by the contact potential @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the scattering length .",
    "the function @xmath22 and @xmath23 states have the same form , and we assume that they do not overlap .",
    "so we obtain the following expression for the hamiltonian @xmath27 where the parameter @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 measures the strength of the interatomic interaction .    for convenience",
    "we express the hamiltonian ( [ rbec3 ] ) in terms of su(2 ) operators by applying the standard schwinger representation of two modes .",

    "just as the glauber coherent states of a mode with annihilation operator @xmath67 can be obtained by acting with a displacement operator @xmath68 @xmath69 on the vacuum state , the scs follows by a rotation @xmath70 with @xmath71 , acting on the state @xmath72 .",
    "when we view this state @xmath73 as the ground state , the operator @xmath74 is analogous to the annihilation operator , since @xmath75 .",
    "an essential difference between the two cases is , of course , that the state space of a radiation mode has infinite dimensions , while the dimension of the angular - momentum state space is @xmath45 .    in our case",

    "so one approaches ideal rabi oscillations between resonant levels .",
    "weaker coupling implies a larger oscillation period .",
    "the two - level behavior can only occur for a system with a nonlinear term @xmath124 , since for a linear system the various transitions are simultaneously in resonance @xcite and @xcite .",

    "again , this situation is specific for a system with a non - linear term @xmath124 in the hamiltonian , since for a linear system various transitions have the same effective coupling .",
    "since the coupling is proportional to @xmath209 , a resonant transition can be turned off by setting the ratio @xmath210 equal to a zero of the bessel function .",

    "the basis states are the states @xmath286 , which are now coupled by the square of the corresponding ladder operator @xmath287 . as in ( [ hresonant ] ) , the coupling term is a series of harmonics with equidistant frequencies @xmath288 , with an amplitude proportional to the bessel function of the corresponding order .    in the high - frequency limit , when the modulation frequency @xmath256 is large compared with the diagonal frequency splittings of the hamiltonian ( [ hnmjux ] ) , the effect of the static term proportional to @xmath289 in eq .",
    "( [ hx ] ) will be dominant , and the hamiltonian will be effectively constant . just as in precious sections ,",
    "the physical reason is that a rapidly modulated field , which has a negligible average pulse area , also has a negligible influence .    on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ hx ] ) immediately shows that the coupling between the state @xmath118 and @xmath290 of the @xmath181th harmonic is resonant when @xmath291 the other coupling terms are negligible when the coupling strength is small compared with the oscillation frequency , which leads to the weak - coupling criterion @xmath292    so , if the initial state @xmath293 @xmath294 is resonantly coupled to @xmath295 , while further couplings of this alter state are negligible , we have an effective two - level system .",
    "this is demonstrated on the figure [ resf4 ] , where besides the resonant oscillations , one obtains non - resonant escape of population to the rest of manifold . upon decreasing the coupling between the state @xmath118 ,",

    "a bec trapped in a two - well potential can be expected to be very sensitive to the frequency of any applied periodic perturbation .",
    "we test this idea by periodically modulating the asymmetry or the barrier height of such a configuration .",
    "compared with the analogous situation of a single atom trapped in a light field with a periodic modulation , the many - particle nature of the bec gives rise to some new effects .",
    "for both types of modulation , two - state resonances may be observed , where a single atom out of the bec oscillates between the wells .",
    "it is also possible to enter a regime of parameters where more than two states are resonantly coupled , with more than one particle oscillating between the wells . using such resonances",
    ", one can manipulate the average number of particles in the wells by varying the relevant parameters , such as the magnitude and the modulation frequency of the energy difference .",
    "this effect can be considered also as a means to resonantly enhance the tunnelling rate between wells .",
    "we generalize the basic ideas developed for two - wells to a multiwell system , such as a bec in an optical lattice . whereas the periodic modulation of the energy difference is related to coupling between number states in the two wells , the periodic modulation of the height of the barrier leads to coupling between number states in superposition states of the two wells with specific values of the relative phase .",
