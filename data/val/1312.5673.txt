    "nature has been solving challenging problems over millions and billions of years , and many biological systems have evolved with intriguing and surprising efficiency in maximizing their evolutionary objectives such as reproduction .",
    "based on the successfully characteristics of biological systems , many nature - inspired algorithms have been developed over the last few decades @xcite .",
    "for example , genetic algorithms were based on the darwinian evolution of biological systems @xcite and particle swarm optimization was based on the swarm behaviour of birds and fish @xcite , which bat algorithm was based on the echolocation behaviour of microbats @xcite and firefly algorithm was based on the flashing light patterns of tropic fireflies @xcite .",
    "all these algorithms have been applied to a wide range of applications .    in many design applications in engineering and industry",
    ", we have to try to find the optimal solution to a given problem under highly complex constraints .",
    "such constrained optimization problems are often highly nonlinear , to find the optimal solutions is often a very challenging task if it is not impossible .",
    "most conventional optimization do not work well for problems with nonlinearity and multimodality .",
    "current trend is to use nature - inspired metaheuristic algorithms to tackle such difficult problems , and it has been shown that metaheuristics are surprisingly very efficient .",
    "for this reason , the literature of metaheuristics has expanded tremendously in the last two decades @xcite . up to now",
    ", researchers have only use a very limited characateristics inspired by nature , and there is room for more algorithm development .    in this paper",
    ", we will propose a new algorithm based on the flower pollination process of flowering plants .",
    "we will first briefly review the main characteristics of flower pollination , and thus idealize these characteristics into four rules .",
    "we will then use them to develop a flower pollination algorithm ( fpa ) , or the flower algorithm .",
    "then , we validate it using a set of well - known test functions and design benchmark .",
    "we analyze the simulations and make comparison of its performance with genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization .",
    "finally , we discuss further topics for extending this algorithm .    from the biological evolution point of view , the objective of the flower pollination is the survival of the fittest and the optimal reproduction of plants in terms of numbers as well as most fittest .",
    "this is in fact an optimization process of plant species .",
    "all the above factors and processes of flower pollination interact so as to achieve optimal reproduction of the flowering plants .",
    "therefore , this can inspire to design new optimization algorithm .",
    "the basic idea of flower pollination in the context of bees and clustering was investigated before @xcite , but in this paper , we will design a completely new optimization solely based on the flower pollination characteristics .",
    "it is estimated that there are over a quarter of a million types of flowering plants in nature and that about 80% of all plant species are flowering species .",
    "it still remains partly a mystery how flowering plants came to dominate the landscape from cretaceous period @xcite .",
    "flowering plant has been evolving for more than 125 million years and flowers have become so influential in evolution , we can not image how the plant world would be without flowers .",
    "the main purpose of a a flower is ultimately reproduction via pollination .",
    "flower pollination is typically associated with the transfer of pollen , and such transfer is often linked with pollinators such as insects , birds , bats and other animals .",
    "in fact , some flowers and insects have co - evolved into a very specialized flower - pollinator partnership .",
    "for example , some flowers can only attract and can only depend on a specific species of insects for successful pollination @xcite .",
    "pollination can take two major forms : abiotic and biotic .",
    "about 90% of flowering plants belong to biotic pollination , that is , pollen is transferred by a pollinator such as insects and animals .",
    "about 10% of pollination takes abiotic form which does not require any pollinators . wind and diffusion in water help pollination of such flowering plants and grass",
    "is a good example @xcite .",
    "pollinators , or sometimes called pollen vectors , can be very diverse .",
    "it is estimate there are at least 200,000 variety of pollinators such as insects , bats and birds .",
    "honeybees are a good example of pollinator , and they can also developed the so - called flower constancy @xcite .",
    "that is , these pollinators tend to visit exclusive certain flower species while bypassing other flower species .",
    "such flower constancy may have evolutionary advantages because this will maximize the transfer of flower pollen to the same or conspecific plants , and thus maximizing the reproduction of the same flower species .",
    "such flower constancy may be advantageous for pollinators as well , because they can be sure that nectar supply is available with their limited memory and minimum cost of learning or exploring . rather than focusing on some unpredictable but potentially more rewarding new flower species ,",
    "flower constancy may require minimum investment cost and more likely guaranteed intake of nectar @xcite .",
    "pollination can be achieved by self - pollination or cross - pollination .",
    "cross - pollination , or allogamy , means pollination can occur from pollen of a flower of a different plant , while self - pollination is the fertilization of one flower , such as peach flowers , from pollen of the same flower or different flowers of the same plant , which often occurs when there is no reliable pollinator available .",
    "biotic , cross - pollination may occur at long distance , and the pollinators such as bees , bats , birds and flies can fly a long distance , thus they can considered as the global pollination .",
    "in addition , bees and birds may behave as lvy flight behaviour @xcite , with jump or fly distance steps obey a lvy distribution .",
    "furthermore , flower constancy can be used an increment step using the similarity or difference of two flowers .",
    "now we can idealize the above characteristics of pollination process , flower constancy and pollinator behaviour as the following rules :    1 .",
    "biotic and cross - pollination is considered as global pollination process with pollen - carrying pollinators performing lvy flights .",
    "abiotic and self - pollination are considered as local pollination .",
    "flower constancy can be considered as the reproduction probability is proportional to the similarity of two flowers involved .",
    "local pollination and global pollination is controlled by a switch probability @xmath0 $ ] . due to the physical proximity and other factors such as wind",
    ", local pollination can have a significant fraction @xmath1 in the overall pollination activities .",
    "obviously , in reality , each plant can have multiple flowers , and each flower patch often release millions and even billions of pollen gametes .",
    "however , for simplicity , we also assume that each plant only has one flower , and each flower only produce one pollen gamete .",
    "thus , there is no need to distinguish a pollen gamete , a flower , a plant or solution to a problem .",
    "this simplicity means a solution @xmath2 is equivalent to a flower and/or a pollen gamete . in future studies , we can easily extend to multiple pollen gametes for each flower and multiple flowers for multiobjective optimization problems .    from the above discussions and the idealized characteristics",
    ", we can design a flower - based on algorithm , namely , flower pollination algorithm ( fpa ) .",
    "there are two key steps in this algorithm , they are global pollination and local pollination .    in the global pollination step ,",
    "flower pollens are carried by pollinators such as insects , and pollens can travel over a long distance because insects can often fly and move in a much longer range .",
    "this ensures the pollination and reproduction of the most fittest , and thus we represent the most fittest as @xmath3 .",
    "the first rule plus flower constancy can be represented mathematically as _",
    "i^t+1=_i^t + l ( _ i^t -*g * _ * ) , where @xmath4 is the pollen @xmath5 or solution vector @xmath2 at iteration @xmath6 , and @xmath3 is the current best solution found among all solutions at the current generation / iteration . the parameter @xmath7 is the strength of the pollination , which essentially is a step size .",
    "since insects may move over a long distance with various distance steps , we can use a lvy flight to mimic this characteristic efficiently @xcite .",
    "that is , we draw @xmath8 from a levy distribution l ~ , ( s s_0>0 ) . here",
    "@xmath9 ) is the standard gamma function , and this distribution is valid for large steps @xmath10 . in all our simulations below , we have used @xmath11 .    the local pollination ( rule 2 ) and flower constancy can be represented as _ i^t+1=_i^t + ( _ j^t -_k^t ) , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are pollens from the different flowers of the same plant species .",
    "this essentially mimic the flower constancy in a limited neighborhood .",
    "mathematically , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 comes from the same species or selected from the same population , this become a local random walk if we draw @xmath14 from a uniform distribution in [ 0,1 ] .",
    "most flower pollination activities can occur at both local and global scale . in practice ,",
    "adjacent flower patches or flowers in the not - so - far - away neighborhood are more likely to be pollinated by local flower pollens that those far away . for this",
    ", we use a switch probability ( rule 4 ) or proximity probability @xmath1 to switch between common global pollination to intensive local pollination . to start with",
    ", we can use @xmath15 as an initially value and then do a parametric study to find the most appropriate parameter range . from our simulations",
    ", we found that @xmath16 works better for most applications .",
    "the above two key steps plus the switch condition can be summarized in the pseudo code shown in fig .",
    "[ fpa - code ] .",
    "any new optimization should be extensively validated and comparison with other algorithms .",
    "there are many test functions , at least over a hundred well - know test functions however , there is no agreed set of test functions for validating new algorithms , though there some review and literature @xcite . in this paper , we will choose a diverse subset of such test functions to validate our proposed flower pollination algorithm ( fpa ) .",
    "in addition , we will also compare the performance of our algorithm with that of genetic algorithms @xcite and particle swarm optimization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will also apply fpa to solve a well - known pressure vessel design benchmark @xcite .",

    "this is a well - known test problem for optimization and it can be written as f ( ) = 0.6224 d_1 r l + 1.7781 d_2 r^2 + 3.1661 d_1 ^ 2 l + 19.84 d_1 ^ 2 r , subject to the following constraints    lll g_1 ( ) = -d_1 + 0.0193 r 0 + g_2 ( ) = -d_2 + 0.00954 r 0 + g_3 ( ) = - r^2 l - r^3 + 1296000 0 + g_4 ( ) = l -240 0 .",

    "recently , cagnina et al ( 2008 ) used an efficient particle swarm optimiser to solve this problem and they found the best solution f _ * 6059.714 , at _ * ( 0.8125 , 0.4375 , 42.0984 , 176.6366 ) .",

    "we have easily found the same as the solution @xmath52 obtained by cagnina et al @xcite .",

    "we can also see that the proposed algorithm approaches the optimal solution exponentially ( see fig .",
    "[ pafig-40 ] ) .     , width=288,height=240 ]    among the three methods , the proposed fpa obtained the best result and converged most quickly .",
    "flowering plants have evolved some interesting features of flower pollination , and we have successfully developed a new flower algorithm to mimic these characteristics .",
    "our simulation results have shown that the the proposed flower pollination algorithm is very efficient and can outperform both genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization .",
    "the convergence rate is essentially exponential as we have seen from the convergence comparison in the previous section .",
    "the reasons that fpa is efficient can be twofold : long - distance pollinators and flower consistency .",
    "pollinators such as insects can travel long distance , and thus they introduce the ability ( into the algorithm ) that they can escape any local landscape and subsequently explore larger search space .",
    "this acts as exploration moves . on the other hand , flower consistency",
    "ensure that the same species of the flowers ( thus similar solutions ) are chosen more frequently and thus guarantee the convergence more quickly .",
    "this step is essentially an exploitation step .",
    "the interplay and interaction of these key components and the selection of the best solution @xmath3 ensure that the algorithm is very efficient .",
    "in the present algorithm , for simplicity , we have assumed that each flower only produce one pollen gamete , this simplifies the implementation greatly .",
    "however , to assign each flower with multiple pollen gametes and each plant with multiple flowers can have some advantages for some applications such as image compression , multiobjective optimization , and graph colouring .",
    "this can form a topic for further research .",
    "another possible extension is to use design other schemes for flower constancy . at present , this constancy is realized by a simple formula",
    ". other more exotic form may be useful to certain type of problem , though the exact improvement may need some extensive simulations .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to extend the flower algorithm to a discrete version so that it can solve combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "all these extensions will be very useful .",
