    "the product reflects the helicity transfer at the weak vertex and originates in the charged current component of the combined process .",
    "the behaviour is reminiscent of similar helicity constraints that influence neutrino- and antineutrino- electron scattering at high energies and distributions in muon and pion decay @xcite .",
    "the suppression of relativistic forward positrons , dictated by the weak vertex is opposed by the virtual photon sector that links the weak vertex to the recoiling nucleus .",
    "the presence of @xmath93 in the denominator of @xmath94 yields the largest probability for those events with the smallest values of @xmath93 .",
    "this tends to focus all final leptons into a narrow forward cone at high energies , since energy - momentum conservation takes the form : @xmath95 , for small @xmath93 .",
    "this is common to many other processes at high energies , including neutrino - electron scattering@xcite and pair production@xcite . as @xmath93 occurs as a square in the denominator it is powerful in maintaining the clustering of all final leptons into a narrow forward cone , with an opening angle of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "the analytic expression for the spin - summed square of the matrix element allows us to understand the competing effects that influence the final distribution . the conflict between the forward cone dictates of usual high - energy exit channel behavior and the strong suppression of forward positrons by the weak vertex and its helicity constraints",
    "can be best compromised by suppressing high energy positrons and enhancing positron population of lower energy states .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the suppression of pion decay by the electron mode despite its favoring by phase space as compared to the dominant muon mode .",
    "the above arguments are supported by the angular and energy and distributions in figs .  7,8 , and 9 . all final leptons dominantly go forward in accordance with traditional pair production observations , and this trend is enhanced at higher energies .",
    "on the other hand , to satisfy the helicity requirements of the charged current component , the positron energy distribution peaks at lower energies and is strongly suppressed at high energies .",
    "this is the direct effect of the term @xmath97 which goes to zero for relativistic forward positrons .",
    "as incident energies increase , the charged leptons would normally tend to become increasingly relativistic and the differentiation in their spectra due to suppression of relativistic forward positrons is accentuated further as seen in fig .",
    "this behavior is also consistent with helicity arguments similar to those that explain the asymmetry in neutrino - antineutrino scattering at high energy , correlations in muon decay and other weak interaction processes .",
    "the second terms do not display this requirement and their interference softens the asymmetry in the distributions as compared to the v - a case .    turning to the electron spectra ,",
    "the second four vector product @xmath88 , involving the electron and the final neutrino , reflects the helicity requirements on these leptons and a similar suppression on their collinearity .",
    "however , this is different from the previous case , where the incident neutrino defines the forward direction . for the electron - final neutrino correlation term ,",
    "both electron and final neutrino have freedom of direction .",
    "this allows a spread to the correlation between them .",
    "however , this too suppresses forward electrons , collinear with the outgoing strongly forward neutrino , and hence peaks the electrons at intermediate energies .",
    "the forward suppression is milder for the electrons as it occurs relative to the final neutrino .",
    "this differs from the case of the positron , which is suppressed with respect to colinearity with the incident neutrino which in fact defines the forward direction .",
    "this can explain the sharper and lower energy peak for the positron as compared to the electron and the stronger forward production of electrons .",
    "we now investigate the importance of the first term that favors lower positron energies compared to the others in @xmath98 and through it on the expression for @xmath99 by quantitative comparisons of the coefficients .",
    "table [ tab3 ] displays the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath100 in the expression for @xmath98 for the v - a , @xmath2 and @xmath25 cases .",

    "it is apparent from table [ tab3 ] , that @xmath89 dominates for @xmath2 and pure charged current ( or v - a ) events , the dominance being more for the v - a case when the second coefficient is zero .",
    "this explains the strong differentiation in the charged lepton spectra for these classes of events .",
    "the presence of the second term , arising from the interference from the neutral current contributions , softens the @xmath2 spectra slightly , compared to the v - a case . on the other hand , for @xmath25 events , both coefficients are of similar magnitude , giving rise to the much softer differentiation in the charged lepton spectra for these events .    the energy and angular distributions reported here have been calculated in the laboratory frame using the reduced matrix elements to enable comparison with corresponding analytic expressions .",
    "a check with the complete matrix elements , indicated that the agreement between the reduced and complete matrix elements is even better for the distributions than for the cross sections .",
    "further , the distributions are of use and interest mainly to display the underlying physics and to be indicative of experimental signals .",

    "from the laboratory perspective , the event signature would be the produced pair , both members being emitted predominantly in the forward direction .",
    "the opening angle of the outgoing positron is larger than that of the electron as discussed earlier .",
    "further , the positron energies peak at the lower energy end of the spectrum while electron energies have a broader distribution of energies . events of this type could be studied by detecting both components of the produced pair in coincidence .",
    "such pairs should be distinct from those arising from de - excitation of nuclei , as the energy available to the latter pair is fixed by the de - excitation energy of the nucleus and the correlation signature of such a de - excitation pair .",
    "in contrast , the energy distributions of the neutrino - initiated direct pairs display continuum characteristics , and the angular distributions respect helicity constraints of the electroweak vertex and the physics of the photon vertex .    if the primary experimental interest is not to detect the bremsstrahlung process itself , but rather its influence on measurements of the lowest order neutrino - nucleus events or neutrino flux determinations , this can be estimated using the theoretical cross sections presented in this paper and the empirical formula obtained for them .",
    "a major focus of current neutrino science is the detection of neutrinos of extra - terrestrial origin , - those from the sun or from supernovae .",
    "the primary event signatures for these are from charged current neutrino interactions occurring on the detector target nuclei .",
    "detection processes that measure the outgoing electron in neutrino induced charged current events could pick up pseudo - events generated by electrons from bremsstrahlung events , particularly in high z targets like lead or iodine . as experimental constraints tighten and increased accuracy in event rates is attempted , it becomes important to estimate the effects of backgrounds such as the pair bremsstrahlung investigated in this paper . as mentioned earlier , the pair bremsstrahlung cross sections of order @xmath102 may become comparable to order alpha corrections to the lowest order electroweak channels and @xmath103 order processes for values of z exceeding 12 .    the process could also be a potential source of background to neutrino - electron scattering experiments and experiments that use @xmath70 scattering to establish flux measurements and normalizations . this background will be increasingly important for higher z values of the nuclei of the material hosting the participating electrons . even for light nuclei ,",
    "the process could be a source of background for experiments that seek flux - accuracy to a few percent , or better .",
    "we present pair bremsstrahlung cross sections folded with neutrino energy spectra for neutrinos emanating from thermal sources with typical supernovae temperatures in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "we compare our results for iron and lead with those for neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "we have used for the neutrino distributions , the normalized fermi - dirac form given in @xcite for appropriate supernova temperatures .",
    "as expected , the contribution of pair bremsstrahlung increases as a relative percentage of the neutrino - electron scattering for increasing z and energy values .",
    "the results in table [ tab4 ] include thermal sources at temperatures higher than those expected to generate the bulk of electron neutrinos , which decouple at temperatures lower than the higher flavor neutrinos .",
    "this inclusion allows for their use in applications involving supernova thermometry that explore oscillations from tau and muon to electron flavors @xcite .",
    "muon or tau neutrinos that have oscillated to electron flavor would interact in a terrestrial detector according to the electron neutrino values at the appropriately higher temperatures .",
    "a comment about anti - neutrino events is in order .",
    "the diagrams of figures  13 can be easily modified to describe anti - neutrino induced events . as a particle - antiparticle pair is produced , crossing symmetry dictates identical cross sections for incident neutrinos or anti neutrinos .",
    "this has been discussed in additional detail in @xcite . however , the distributions in figures  79 would display an interchange between the charged leptons due to the well - known flipping of the charged current part ( appearing through the first term in @xmath98 ) as neutrino - electron scattering changes from incident neutrinos to antineutrinos .",
    "this does not alter the final cross sections and the results presented here for neutrinos would apply equally to antineutrinos .    apart from the influence of pair bremsstrahlung on the detection of cosmic neutrinos and hence on our understanding of the astrophysical events they portray , the question of possible roles in the astrophysical dynamics themselves also arises . what might be the astrophysical environments to spawn such neutrino - bremsstrahlung pairs ?",
    "high z environments such as pre - collapse supernova cores , scenes of the stalled shock , or the neutrino - driven winds hosting the r - process and neutrino nucleosynthesis suggest themselves as potential sites . the density of the fermi sea , however , would inhibit low - energy electron production in pre - collapse cores .",
    "it may be noted that the coulomb distortion effect would affect low - energy electron and positron emission oppositely and could be considered , along with the fermi sea effects , to determine the cross sections in physical supernova environments .    the question does arise whether the pair bremsstrahlung might be more important for anti neutrinos in supernova environments with a high population of neutron - rich nuclei . as the lowest order nuclear channels are suppressed due to non- availability of neutron states as well as the negative effects of the coulomb barrier @xcite , other channels such as pair bremsstrahlung may provide alternate means of slowing anti - neutrinos .",
    "we would like to thank professor leo stodosky for pointing out the possibility of using the neutrino - nucleus pair production as an experimental tool to study the photon - neutrino cross sections.@xcite    this research was sponsored by the division of nuclear physics of the u.  s.  department of energy under contract no .",
