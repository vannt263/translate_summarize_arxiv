    "the area under the fermi - smeared peak gives the number of protons in the nucleus , and hence the position of the peak determines the number of neutrons .",

    "the bfkl equation has the structure  =  k f_g  =  f_g which , at small @xmath0 , has the the solution f_g",
    "~   e^(1/x )  ~  x^-  ~  ( ) ^ , [ eq : lamb ] where @xmath288 is the leading eigenvalue of the bfkl kernel @xmath289 .",
    "this has an analogous form to the regge - pole exchange behaviour of the amplitude , a(s , t )   ~   _ r _ r(t)()^_r(t ) , [ eq : a1 ] which is the cornerstone of the description of high - energy `` soft '' hadron - hadron interactions ; @xmath290 is the trajectory of reggeon @xmath28 in the complex angular momentum plane . for colour - octet exchange",
    "the bfkl equation describes a reggeized gluon with trajectory @xmath291 , while for colour - singlet exchange , which is relevant to this discussion , it leads to a cut in the complex angular momentum , @xmath292 , plane corresponding to two reggeized gluons exchanged  often called the perturbative pomeron .",
    "note that the generalized gluon distribution @xmath293 corresponds to the two - gluon exchange amplitude .",
    "its behaviour at low @xmath0 is driven by the rightmost singularity ( branch point ) , @xmath294 , produced by the two - gluon cut , where the value of @xmath9 obtained from the bfkl equation is given above . since the behaviour of @xmath293 is driven by a cut ( and not an isolated pole ) in the @xmath292-plane , a prefactor @xmath295 will appear in ( [ eq : lamb ] ) .",
    "the possible connection between ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lamb ] ) is indicated by a horizontal ` block ' arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : hera ] . in the `` soft '' regime",
    "the hadrons are reggeized , while in the perturbative qcd bfkl regime the constituent partons are reggeized .",
    "how to go from one regime to the other has not been solved .",
    "for example , what is the relation of the bfkl or perturbative qcd ` pomeron ' ( given by a ladder diagram formed from the exchange of two @xmath296-channel reggeized gluons ) to the ` pomeron ' describing soft high - energy proton - proton interactions ?    coming back to the discussion centred on the perturbative expansion of equation ( [ eq : pggbfkl ] ) , we note that in the small @xmath0 region the gluon dominates , and only @xmath281 and @xmath297 contain @xmath283 contributions .",
    "these are positive but smaller than naively expected ; it turns out that @xmath298 , and even @xmath299 , in ( [ eq : pggbfkl ] ) .",
    "now the next - to - leading ( @xmath300 ) terms , @xmath301 , have also been calculated @xcite .",
    "these give a large , negative , contribution to the gluon , leading to instability at small @xmath0 .",
    "in fact @xmath9 of ( [ eq : lamb ] ) is now given by = 12_sln2/  ( 1 - 6.5_s ) .",
    "this problem has been the subject of considerable investigation . clearly , the higher - order contributions , @xmath302 , @xmath303 , ... are important .",
    "however it took about 10 years to calculate the @xmath300 contributions , so to compute the next order or two appears unrealistic , and even then may not converge to a stable result . instead , the procedure that has been followed is to identify a few physical qcd effects that lead to large higher - order corrections and then to resum them .",
    "indeed , this all - order resummation of the main effects is found to tame the wild ( @xmath283 @xmath272 @xmath300 ) behaviour ; a readable review is given in @xcite .",
    "the approaches of the various groups have reached similar conclusions : the approximate all - order resummed bfkl framework leads to the behaviour that xg ~x^-0.3   as  x 0 [ eq : sx ] at low scales data are fitted to the form @xmath304 for @xmath305 , then it is found that @xmath9 grows approximately linearly with log@xmath26 from @xmath306 passing through @xmath307 at @xmath308 . the simple assumption that this reflects the behaviour of the gluon , with @xmath76 driven by the @xmath309 transition is much too naive .",
    "indeed the global analyses give a gluon which is valence - like at small @xmath0 at the input scale . ] .    in practice , it is found that this power - like growth only sets in at very small @xmath0 . in terms of dglap evolution",
    "all the bfkl effects should be included in the resummed splitting functions used to describe the transition between two quite different scales , that is between partons whose transverse momentum are very different .",
    "in such a case the power growth ( [ eq : sx ] ) will be included in the resummed @xmath281 .",
    "however the resummed @xmath310 has a _ dip _ centred at @xmath256 , and the power growth is only evident below @xmath311 . indeed the resummed @xmath310 and the nnlo dglap @xmath310 are in good agreement down to @xmath256 .    to make quantitative predictions in the small @xmath0 domain , @xmath312 with @xmath278 , where no data exist , is extremely difficult .",
    "we need to obtain the resummed ln@xmath275 solution starting from some non - perturbative amplitude at @xmath313 .",
    "this non - perturbative distribution ( which is analogous to the ` input ' in the dglap approach ) is not known theoretically .",
    "either one has to fit it to data ( but again low @xmath0 data are needed ) or to use some phenomenological model ( for example , based on a regge parametrization ) .",
    "we conclude that the parton densities are unknown in the region @xmath312 . at very small @xmath0",
    "we have the estimate that gluon density might behave as @xmath314 with @xmath315 .",
    "however , as @xmath0 decreases , at some stage this behaviour will violate unitarity . here",
    "the recombination of gluons ( absorptive effects ) come to the rescue , and tame the violations of unitarity . to this",
    "we now turn .",
    "the saturation of parton densities ( @xmath316 ) may be obtained using the gribov - levin - ryskin ( glr ) equation @xcite or the more precise balitski - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .",
    "these equations sum up the set of so - called _ fan _ diagrams which describe the rescattering of intermediate partons on the target nucleon .",
    "the screening caused by these rescatterings prohibits the power growth of the parton densities .",
    "the glr equation for the gluon may be written in the symbolic form  =  p_gg g+p_gq q - [ xg(x,q^2)]^2 . the non - linear shadowing term , @xmath317 ^ 2 $ ] , describes the recombination of gluons .",
    "it arises from perturbative qcd diagrams which couple @xmath318 to @xmath319  that is two gluon ladders recombining into a single gluon ladder , which is called a _",
    "the minus sign occurs because the scattering amplitude corresponding to a gluon ladder is predominantly imaginary .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is a measure of the transverse area @xmath320 where the gluons are concentrated .",
    "the bk equation is an improved version of the glr equation .",
    "it accounts for a more precise form of the triple - pomeron vertex and can be used for the non - forward amplitude .",
    "the glr equation , based on dglap evolution , was in momentum space ; whereas the bk equation , based on the bfkl equation , is written in coordinate space in terms of the dipole scattering amplitude @xmath321 . here",
    "@xmath322 and @xmath323 are the transverse coordinates of the two @xmath296-channel gluons which form the colour - singlet dipole , and @xmath324 is the rapidity .",
    "the bk equation reads [ bke ] = \\ { n_+n_-n _ - n_n _ } , where , interestingly , the non - linear and linear terms have the _ same _ bfkl kernel @xmath289 , which is shown explicitly in ( [ bke ] ) . for small dipole densities , @xmath325 , the quadratic term in the brackets may be neglected , and , indeed , ( [ bke ] ) reproduces the conventional bfkl equation .",
    "however for large @xmath325 , that is @xmath326 , the r.h.s . of ( [ bke ] ) vanishes , and we reach saturation when @xmath327 .",
    "the equation sums up the set of fan diagrams where at the lower ( small @xmath328 ) end the target emits any number of pomerons ( i.e. linear bfkl amplitudes ) , while at the upper ( large @xmath328 ) end we have only one bfkl dipole .    in principle",
    ", it would appear more appropriate to use the bfkl - based bk equation to describe the parton densities at low @xmath0 .",
    "it is an attempt to describe saturation phenomena .",
    "however it is just a model and can not , at present , be used to reliably estimate absorptive effects at small @xmath0 .",
    "is there any evidence of the onset of absorptive effects in the experimental data ?",
    "these should occur first at low @xmath0 and low @xmath26 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hera ] . however , there is no conclusive evidence that absorptive effects are important in the hera data in the perturbative regime , @xmath329 .",
    "the various claims that are frequently made have been recently comprehensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is seen that none of them , including the observed ` flat ' ratio of ( diffractive dis / inclusive dis ) or the observation of geometric scaling , provide any compelling evidence of saturation effects .    of course , as @xmath0 decreases we know that ultimately absorptive effects must be present .",
    "in principle , we should be able to estimate their contribution from knowledge of the structure functions for diffractive dis , via f_2^abs  ~   -f_2^_d _ , where @xmath330 is the structure function for the process @xmath331 in which the slightly deflected proton and the cluster @xmath332 of outgoing hadrons are well separated in rapidity @xcite .",
    "the great improvement in the precision and range of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data over the last few years has enabled the partonic structure of the proton to be well determined in the @xmath333 interval , so we are able to make reliable predictions for the production of new massive states at the lhc .",
    "global analyses are now available at nnlo .",
    "these analyses require particularly careful treatment at the heavy quark thresholds , see thorne @xcite and references therein .",
    "a surprise is that a pure dglap description is able to describe all features of the data down to @xmath334 , in spite of the fact that the global fits are now quite tightly constrained .",
    "the allowance of beyond - dglap effects is not found to improve the description , see , for example @xcite .",
    "another surprise is that the global analyses reveal that the gluon has a valence - like small @xmath0 behaviour at the low input scale , unlike the sea quark distribution which behaves as expected , see ( [ eq : input ] ) .",
    "such a result looks strange from the regge viewpoint where the same vacuum singularity ( pomeron ) should drive both the sea quarks and the gluons ; i.e. the same power @xmath335 is expected for sea quarks and gluons .",
    "note that global analyses are only reliable down to @xmath256 .",
    "the low @xmath0 domain , @xmath312 , is unchartered territory .",
    "is it possible for the lhc experiments to determine the behaviour of partons in the important low @xmath0 region below @xmath336 at low scales ?",
    "one possibility is @xmath337 drell - yan production in which events are observed with the @xmath337 invariant mass as low as possible and the rapidity as large as possible .",
    "for example , for @xmath338 gev and @xmath339 , we sample quarks at @xmath340 , see fig .  [ fig : lhckin ] .",
    "this process samples predominantly the sea quark distributions . to study the small @xmath0 behaviour of the gluon at low scales we may consider @xmath341 production , it may be better to observe the process @xmath342 as a function of @xmath343 .",
    "this process also depends sensitively on the gluon distribution via the subprocesses @xmath344 .",
    "there are also contributions from the subprocesses @xmath345 with @xmath346 , and @xmath347 .",
    "the analysis of such data will be considerably helped by the detailed observations of prompt @xmath348 , as well as @xmath348 from @xmath146 , central production at the tevatron . ] , or prompt photon production driven by the subprocess @xmath349 , or perhaps @xmath345 .",
