    "lst and band emissivity retrieval depends upon specifying an emissivity value in one or more reference bands .",
    "the modis land surface temperature ( lst ) algorithm  @xcite seeks a pair of reference channels in a part of the thermal spectrum in which the emissivity of natural surfaces displays very limited variation , and may therefore be regarded as known with good confidence .",
    "multiband emissvities inferred on this basis are called `` relative '' emissivities  @xcite .",
    "other algorithms of this nature include the reference channel method  @xcite , emissivity normalization  @xcite , temperature - independent spectral index method  @xcite ,  @xcite and spectral ratios  @xcite .",
    "the study by li et al .",
    "@xcite shows that all of these relative emissivity retrieval algorithms are closely related , and argues that they may be expected to show comparable performance .",
    "the analysis of multispectral thermal imager ( mti ) data  @xcite depends on collection of radiance from a surface with looks at nadir and 60 degrees off - nadir , assuming a known angular dependence of emissivity , in order to balance equations and unknowns .",
    "the generalized split - window lst algorithm  @xcite likewise uses dual looks in a regression - law based approach . the `` grey body emissivity '' approach  @xcite exploits the slow variation of emissivity with wavelength for certain natural targets , while the physics - based modis lst algorithm  @xcite exploits observations taken at day and at night , on the assumption that band emissivites do not change over periods of a few weeks .",
    "a study with the airborne hyperspectral scanner @xcite compares multiple tes approaches .",
    "we shall investigate a simulated annealing approach to the tes problem .",
    "the approach is an extension of earlier work on bayesian tes @xcite .",
    "simulated annealing can not give a unique solution to this problem , but we shall prove that the average of a large number of simulated annealing tes solutions converges almost surely to a unique tes estimate .",
    "this paper will concentrate on the mathematical basis of the algorithm and a proof of its convergence .",
    "a study of its performance will form the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "simulated annealing has traditionally been regarded as a preferred method of global solution for combinatorial optimization problems such as traveling salesman . in this paper , we adapt the metropolis algorithm @xcite to an optimization problem that lacks a unique global optimal solution : temperature - emissivity separation .",
    "the underdetermined temperature - emissivity separation ( tes ) problem , notoriously @xcite-@xcite , has a continuous infinity of solutions that yield the identical optimum value for any cost or payoff function one cares to choose .",
    "a key part of any simulated annealing algorithm is the choice of an annealing schedule that causes the posterior probabilities to transition from nearly uniform to very tight in such a way as to evade the risk of the map search from converging to a local , rather than a global , optimum .",
    "the look and feel of the justification for this approach is ergodic .    in what follows",
    "we shall mostly concern ourself with the existence of a solution to the simulated annealing tes problem , and shall simply assume that a suitable annealing schedule has been supplied .",

    "the choice of background @xmath0 is thus made in much the same way as an empirical orthogonal basis set is selected .",

    "<S> the method of simulated annealing is adapted to the temperature - emissivity separation ( tes ) problem . a patch of surface at the bottom of the atmosphere is assumed to be a greybody emitter with spectral emissivity @xmath0 describable by a mixture of spectral endmembers . </S>",

    "<S> the average of a large number of simulated annealing solutions , however , converges almost surely to a unique maximum a - posteriori solution for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the limitation to a stipulated set of endmember emissivities may be relaxed by allowing the number of endmembers to grow without bound , and to be generic continuous functions of wavenumber with bounded first derivatives with respect to wavenumber .    </S>",
