    "circinus x-1 ( hereafter cir  x-1 ) is a bright x - ray binary located on the galactic plane .",
    "the nature of the large variability in various time scales has not been well understood yet .",
    "the source shows a recurrent x - ray activity coupled with an orbital period of 16.6  d @xcite .",
    "it is also known to show long - term variabilities on a time - scale of years , and the flux level varies from undetectable levels to more than 1  crab ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when the luminosity is high , it frequently showed x - ray outbursts and radio flares by the 16.6  d orbital cycle .",
    "the flaring events are believed to be caused by an increased mass transfer from the companion star near the periastron passage of a highly eccentric binary orbit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray outbursts are accompanied by absorption dips in the x - ray flux .",
    "@xcite reported that the x - ray dips would provide more accurate system clock than the maximum of the x - ray outbursts . recently",
    ", periodic radio flares are considered more suitable for defining the orbital motion , and used as the phase zero in the ephemeris @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectra observed with asca , rxte , and bepposax during the dips are consistent with a partial covering model of absorbing matter in which the intensity of the intrinsic emission does not change ( @xcite ; @xcite ; observations of chandra hetgs near periastron have revealed presence of emission lines of h - like and/or he - like ne , mg , si , s , and fe .",
    "these lines are broad and show p cygni profiles with velocities of @xmath3  km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that a wind with a moderate temperature ( @xmath4  k ) from the x - ray - heated accretion disk is responsible for the p cygni profiles .",

    "the condition for wind stripping is that the ram pressure of the stellar wind ( @xmath167 ) is larger than the gas pressure of the accretion disk ( @xmath168 ) . here , assuming a spherical stellar wind , the density of the stellar wind is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the mass loss rate of the companion star , and @xmath171 is the distance from the center of the companion star .",
    "the gas pressure of the accretion disk on the equatorial plane is @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the mass of the neutron star , @xmath174 is the half - thickness of the disk , and @xmath175 is the density on the equatorial plane of the outer accretion disk .",
    "the density , @xmath175 , is given by @xcite as @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath178 is the neutron star mass normalized by @xmath179 , @xmath180 is the x - ray luminosity , @xmath181 is the eddington luminosity ( @xmath182 erg s@xmath1 ) , @xmath183 is the distance from the neutron star , @xmath184 is the schwarzschild radius of the neutron star , and @xmath185 ( where @xmath186 is the inner disk radius ) . the half thickness of the disk , @xmath174 , is also given by @xcite as @xmath187    figure  [ fig7 ] shows the allowed regions in the plane of the stellar wind velocity and distance from the neutron star . in this calculation , we adopted @xmath170 = @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "we also adopted @xmath177 = 0.11 , @xmath190 erg s@xmath1 , and @xmath191 ( @xmath192 . the typical stellar wind velocity is between the horizontal dotted lines . here , the vertical dotted line indicates the estimated typical outer disk radius assuming the exponential decay model ( @xmath155 cm ) . to the right of solid and dashed lines , the conditions for wind stripping are .",
    "next , we consider other conditions as follows .",
    "for instance , the accretion radius could be larger than that derived from exponential decay model and the ram pressure of the stellar wind is likely about one order of magnitude higher than that of the smooth wind adopted in this paper .",
    "as shown in subsection  [ outerradius ] , we can not determine whether the decay is exponential or linear . here",
    ", we notice that periastron spikes do not occur in the outbursts with a sudden drop .",
    "this may indicate that the x - ray irradiation is smaller because there is no spherical accretion onto the neutron star .",
    "moreover , it is now widely accepted that the wind of ob stars is clumpy .",
    "the core density becomes one order of magnitude higher than that in the smooth wind ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . with 10 times higher density wind in equation ( 8) , the solid and dashed lines in figure  [ fig7 ] move to the left , and this change , together with the larger outer radius ( @xmath193 ) , makes the wind stripping model consistent with the observations .",
    "even when the ram pressure of the wind does not exceed the gas pressure on the equatorial plane , it may blow out the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "this may cause expansion of the disk followed by a decrease in @xmath168 .",
    "then the interaction causes a state transition at the outer part of the accretion disk .",
    "the luminosity may suddenly drop below the soft - to - hard transition luminosity , that is , @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 @xcite , although that the state transition occurred in the outer disk region in our results .",
    "we also estimated the time scale of propagation of the sudden stripping from the outer disk to the inner disk .",
    "the viscous time scale is given by @xcite as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the mass accretion rate in units of @xmath196 g s@xmath1 , and @xmath197 is the typical length scale for surface density changes in the disk in units @xmath198 cm .",
    "@xmath177 = 0.11 , @xmath195 = 5.3 ( @xmath199  erg s@xmath1 ) , @xmath178 = 1 , and @xmath200",
    "out of 21 outbursts observed with maxi / gsc , 7 showed sudden luminosity decreases periastron , which led to the end of the outburst .",
    "the light curve of the decay part can be fitted as well by either a single linear function or a single exponential function .",
    "we investigated three for the sudden end of the outburst periastron : ( 1 ) the end of the outburst during the dip , ( 2 ) the propeller effect , and ( 3 ) the stripping effect by the stellar wind of the companion star .",
    "( 1 ) is only two outbursts , assuming linear decay .",
    "( 2 ) is not plausible because a luminosity significantly higher than 1%4% of the eddington luminosity is required for a state transition .",
    "if the inner disk is truncated , however , it is possible for the transition to occur at a higher luminosity , and the sudden drop can be explained by the propeller effect .",
    "however , disk truncation in our results , although the variability in the luminosity before the sudden drop suggests instability in the inner disk .",
    "finally , it is also difficult to explain the sudden drop by ( 3 ) however , in the case of wind clumping and/or large outer radius assuming linear decay , it is possible for the wind stripping to trigger the sudden end of the outburst . the interaction may cause the state transition at the outer part of the accretion disk . as a result , the luminosity may suddenly drop below the soft - to - hard transition luminosity , @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 .",
