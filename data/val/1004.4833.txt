    "recently , general relativistic simulations demonstrated that the coalescence of a black hole binary is accompanied by the anisotropic emission of gravitational radiation , causing a typical recoil of hundreds of @xmath2 for the black hole remnant @xcite .",
    "binaries of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) are a generic consequence of galaxy mergers @xcite , and the resultant gravitational waves ( gws ) are potentially detectable with the proposed _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( lisa ) or existing pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) such as nanograv .",
    "lisa would be most sensitive to binary mergers with a total mass @xmath3 @xcite , whereas the pta sensitivity peaks at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "ptas have a significantly poorer localization ability , with a typical uncertainty@xcite of @xmath5 compared to @xmath6 square degrees for lisa .",
    "these positional errors limit the precise determination of the luminosity distance to merging binaries .",
    "an electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart would greatly reduce the positional error to sub - arcsecond scales , and also determine the redshift of the source , which would enable its use as a `` standard siren '' ( independent of the cosmic distance ladder ) for precision measurements of the dark energy equation of state @xcite .    for these reasons ,",
    "prompt em signals are of primary importance for realizing the full potential of gw cosmology .",
    "the proposed prompt em signals have so far all assumed the uncertain presence of a circumbinary accretion disk prior to coalescence .",
    "dissipation of gw energy in the disk might result in a weak em transient shortly after the merger @xcite , re - equilibration of the inner edge of the disk could create an x - ray brightening on a timescale of @xmath7@xmath8 @xcite , and shocks produced by the gw - induced recoil might generate em reverberations after the recoil @xcite which may take @xmath9 years to dissipate as enhanced infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious whether these em signals could be distinguished from the much more abundant sources of temporal variability in single smbh quasars .",
    "moreover , the luminosity of any circumbinary disk is expected to be significantly reduced by the cavity associated with the decoupling of the binary from the inner edge of the disk in the final stage of inspiral @xcite .",
    "the disk is not expected to refill the cavity and return to its full luminosity for a time @xmath10 after coalescence @xcite . on longer timescales , the portion of the accretion disk that remains bound to the recoiled smbh is expected to be detectable as a kinematically and eventually a spatially offset quasar @xcite , although its lifetime is limited by the supply of gas that can remain gravitationally bound to it @xcite .    here",
    "we show that the tidal disruption of stars provides a prompt em flag that does not depend on the prior existence of a gaseous disk in the vicinity of the merging binary , and can result from mergers of gas - poor galaxies .",
    "recent observations have demonstrated that tidal disruption events ( tdes ) have a generic lightcurve and emission spectrum @xcite that are distinguishable from normal quasar variability .",
    "moreover , we find that smbh recoil results in a sequence of tdes over a timescale of decades and potentially years , with a rate that is @xmath11 orders of magnitude higher than the typical tde rate in normal galaxies @xcite . the existence of tdes accompanying smbh mergers has been studied in the past only for long time delays ( @xmath12@xmath13yr ) before @xcite or after @xcite the binary coalescence event .",
    "while previous studies have focused on mechanisms to slowly feed stars into an empty loss cone , here we show that _ gw recoil will instantaneously shift the loss cone to a non - empty region of phase space_.",
    "a star will be tidally disrupted by a smbh of mass @xmath14 if it passes within the tidal distance , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mass and radius of the star and @xmath18 is a dimensionless constant of order unity @xcite . in our discussion",
    "we adopt @xmath19 and assume an approximate main sequence scaling law of @xmath20 , which implies @xmath21@xcite .",
    "tidal disruption does not occur if @xmath22 is smaller than the event horizon radius @xmath23 , in which case the star is swallowed intact by the black hole . for non - spinning black holes and solar mass stars , tdes are therefore possible for @xmath24 .",
    "a significant black hole spin can allow for ( angle - dependent ) tdes by smbhs with @xmath25 @xcite . during a tde ,",
    "half of the star s mass becomes unbound , while the rest flows on keplerian trajectories , until the associated gas streams return to pericenter and collisionally shock each other @xcite .",
    "these gas streams return at a characteristic mass infall rate @xmath26 ( roughly speaking ; see @xcite for a more thorough treatment ) and form an accretion disk whose blackbody emission peaks in the uv or soft x - ray with luminosities comparable to a supernova @xcite .",
    "other sources of emission include line radiation from the unbound debris @xcite , and a possible brief period of super - eddington mass fallback .",
    "these features are useful for differentiating tde flares from supernovae or quasar variability , and some have already been applied to candidate events@xcite .    in a spherical galaxy with a stationary smbh ,",
    "a star is tidally disrupted if its orbital angular momentum per unit mass falls below a critical value , @xmath27 where we have approximated the relevant orbit as nearly radial .",
    "such orbits define the so - called `` loss cone '' .",
    "the rate of tdes for a stationary smbh is set by relaxation processes .",
    "inward of a certain galacto - centric radius the loss cone is empty , but outside of it there is a `` pinhole '' regime where the rate of scatter in and out of the loss cone is greater than the orbital frequency @xcite .    over",
    "the long orbital timescale of stars , the impulsive gw - induced recoil of the smbh remnant from a binary coalescence event yields a nearly instantaneous change in the black hole velocity relative to the stars @xcite . viewed from the rest frame of the black hole",
    ", there is a sudden shift in the velocity of all stars , yielding a new loss cone defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the smbh kick velocity .",
    "we parametrize the density of stars around a smbh binary in the last stages of its inspiral , using a power - law profile , @xmath30 this density profile corresponds to an isotropic pre - kick distribution function of stars , @xmath31 where the normalizing constant is given by @xmath32 which in turn depends on the observationally calibrated @xcite radius of influence of the smbh ( inside of which the mass in stars is @xmath33 ) . for a full sample of galaxies",
    "this is @xmath34 while for core galaxies alone it is @xmath35 stars will be bound to the black hole system of total mass @xmath36 before the binary coalescence if @xmath37 and after coalescence if @xmath38 the intersection of these two spheres in velocity space , with each other and with the loss cone , is the region of phase - space containing bound stars which are tidally disrupted after the recoil . by performing a monte carlo integration of the appropriate distribution function over this region",
    "we calculate the number of post - recoil tdes . through a separate integral",
    "we find that the unbound stars provide @xmath39 of the total number of tdes and can be neglected .",
    "another small correction to the total rate involves the net smbh mass loss by gw emission , which is typically @xmath40 of the pre - merger mass @xcite .",
    "we have included the associated small reduction ( by @xmath41 ) in the number of tidally disrupted stars . to evaluate the observability of the recoil - induced tdes , we define the quantity @xmath42 as the number of stars in the post - recoil loss cone which are tidally disrupted in @xmath43 years . since stars which fall into the new loss cone are near their apocenter in the rest frame of the kicked black hole , @xmath44 is the number of stars with orbital periods below 200 years .",
    "the result of the monte carlo integral is sensitive to the innermost region of the distribution function , whose details are determined by the pre - merger dynamical environment . in particular , the smbh binary will excavate a larger and more complex loss region than is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "below , we consider the innermost regions of phase space in gas - poor and gas - rich mergers , separately .",
    ", in the dry merger , joint core - cusp case .",

    "represents the physically realistic scenario including the binary loss cone discussed in the text , whereas the black line ( labeled ` nblc ' ) accounts only for the loss cone of a single black hole .",

    "however , core galaxies are believed to be the end product of a binary inspiral , as the binary sheds angular momentum by ejecting stars . numerical simulations of this process show that a binary hardening its orbit through scattering of stars will scour a core @xcite , but at some point depletion of the remaining stars in the binary loss cone ( including in this context stars whose pericenters fall within twice the binary semimajor axis ) will lead to a stalling of the binary and the so - called `` final parsec problem '' @xcite . without gas , the binary can only merge via a re - population of its loss cone",
    ". significant triaxiality of the galaxy potential @xcite tends to re - populate the binary loss - cone but preserve a core with @xmath48 .",
    "alternatively , collisional processes generate a central cusp of stars , though this method of binary hardening is only effective for binary masses @xmath49 @xcite , and it may be modified in the presence of massive perturbers@xcite , such as infalling molecular clouds in gas - rich mergers .",
    "these gas - free scenarios lead us to consider both core galaxies where @xmath50 , and galaxies with a joint core - cusp density profile where an inner @xmath51 profile meets an outer @xmath50 profile at a radius of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "we use equation([rinfcore ] ) as the radius of influence in these models .",
    "it is necessary to exclude the stars located in the pre - coalescence loss cone .",
    "the size of this region of phase space is somewhat uncertain .",
    "for collisional re - population of the loss cone , numerical simulations @xcite indicate the smbh binary will decouple from a relaxed distribution of stars at a semimajor axis of @xmath53 , and coalesce before the stars can relax into the gap left behind . to model",
    "this cavity in energy space we remove all stars with semimajor axes less than this radius . however , because relaxation in angular momentum is faster than in energy , the resultant gap in angular momentum space will be partially refilled prior to the merger .",
    "the timescale for filling up a gap in angular momentum space is given by @xcite , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the semimajor axis of the smbh binary , taken to be the pericenter at which stars are ejected @xcite , and the system relaxation time at the radius of influence is @xcite , @xmath56 thus , a second cavity in the distribution function is created by removing all stars with pre - kick pericenters lower than the binary separation @xmath55 at which @xmath57 equals the gravitational wave timescale , @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the reduced mass of the binary and @xmath60 . for simplicity , we adopt a flat @xmath61 dependence for @xmath62 with the cuts mentioned above . in the classical loss cone calculation , the steady state solution of the orbit - averaged fokker - planck equation yields a distribution function that varies logarithmically with @xmath61 at fixed @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "however , this solution may not apply to the innermost stars , for which the orbit averaged assumption may break down and strong star - star scatterings ( which the fokker - planck approach does not account for ) could be important .",
    "furthermore , the loss cone of a binary smbh is not the pure sink assumed for a single bh , since stars may remain bound to the binary on low-@xmath61 orbits .",
    "the use of a logarithmic instead of a flat distribution would have reduced @xmath42 by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "we use these cuts in stellar energy and angular momentum as modifications to the joint core - cusp profile .",
    "we generalize the results to a range of stellar masses using a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with a differential number of stars , @xmath65 in the mass range @xmath66 .",
    "the number of disruptions is dominated by low mass stars despite their smaller @xmath22 ; switching to a top - heavy imf , as is sometimes discussed in the context of galactic nuclei @xcite , would reduce @xmath44 by a factor of a few .",
    "in gas - rich mergers , the pre - kick profile is likely to be different . on the one hand , rapid loss of angular momentum by the binary to dynamical friction on the gas can produce a core by denying stars the time needed to relax into a central cusp as described above @xcite ; but on the other hand , _ in situ _ star formation could rebuild a nuclear cusp while the binary orbit hardens .",
    "the possibility of star formation , and subsequent migration , in disks motivates us to consider values of @xmath67 .",
    "alternatively , stars formed elsewhere could be `` ground down '' into orbits inside the disk @xcite , and then behave in a similar fashion .",
    "although the details of star formation in disks fragmenting due to gravitational instability are quite complex @xcite , we provide an approximate description of their potential to contribute to the post - kick loss cone here .",
    "if the roche radius of the star in the disk exceeds the disk scale height , and tidal coupling of the star to the disk is at least as effective as viscosity at transporting angular momentum , the star will open a gap in the disk @xcite and migrate inward on a viscous timescale , to the point where those conditions are no longer met , or the disk s inner edge @xcite , whichever is larger . here",
    "we use equation ( [ rinfgeneral ] ) for the radius of influence , since we are considering galactic nuclei in the process of rebuilding their cusps .",

    "is determined by setting the viscous timescale at the radius of marginal self - gravity @xcite , @xmath72 equal to @xmath73 . here",

    "we remove any stars with pericenters interior to the radius at which the smbh binary decouples from the accretion flow , and assume that the remaining stars obtain a nearly spherical angular distribution ( similarly to the innermost s - stars in the milky - way nucleus @xcite ) before the smbh recoil . because the details of star formation within the disk are highly uncertain and the tde rate is dominated by low - mass stars , we assume for simplicity @xmath82 in the wet merger case .",
    "we emphasize that in this case , accretion - induced alignment of smbh spins prior to merger is expected to strongly suppress kicks over @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "other processes could also partially refill the binary loss cone . in analogy to the problem of resonant capture during planetary migration @xcite , mean - motion resonances could be capable of pulling stars inward during the final stages of the smbh merger , dramatically increasing the number of post - kick disruptions . the special case of the 1:1 lagrange point resonance has recently been investigated @xcite and found capable of migrating stars to within tens of schwarzschild radii from the system barycenter @xcite .",
    "higher integer ratio mean - motion resonances have been seen to affect stars ( see @xcite , figures 5 , 6 , 7 ) as a binary smbh hardens , although their ability to drive resonant migration is less clear .",
    "a detailed study of resonant migration in smbh binaries is beyond the scope of this paper , but this effect has the potential to dramatically expand the short - period population of the post - kick loss cone .    for a source at a redshift @xmath84 , cosmological time dilation will stretch the duration of each tde flare , delay the onset of the first post - kick flare , and reduce the observed tde rate all by the same factor of @xmath85 .",
    "however , observations suggest that mean density of stars in high - redshift galaxies scales as @xmath86 @xcite",
    ". this could lead to a net enhancement in the observed tde rate @xmath87 per galaxy , if the central regions of galaxies are self - similar .",

    "an unequal mass would increase @xmath73 and increase @xmath42 by allowing more time for refilling the binary loss cone , but it would also decrease the likely values of @xmath96 .",
    "the latter change dominates only for mass ratios smaller than @xmath97 , so our results should be regarded as conservative for major mergers .",
    "figure [ dryboth ] presents the velocity and mass dependences of our most realistic model ( the joint core - cusp profile , for smbh binaries that harden in dry mergers by scattering of stars ) , as well as a less realistic core - cusp model included for illustrative purposes .",
    "the first model ( labeled blc ) removes stars from the binary loss cone and results in an interesting number of tdes for @xmath98 and @xmath99 . at low velocities ,",
    "overlap with the pre - merger loss cone sharply suppresses @xmath44 , while at high velocities , the reduced size of the bound stellar population also shrinks @xmath44 . at higher masses ,",
    "all short - period stars are scoured by the pre - merger binary loss cone .",
    "the second case in figure [ dryboth ] ( labeled nblc ) replaces the loss cone of a binary with that of a single black hole .",
    "interestingly , the dramatic increase in @xmath44 here results from the addition of relatively few stars ( @xmath100 for @xmath93 ) , indicating that resonant migration of a small population of stars could significantly boost @xmath101 .",
    "finally , the @xmath50 ( pure core ) case does not have enough centrally located stars to produce post - kick tidal disruptions on @xmath102 timescales .",
    "the results for wet mergers are illustrated in figure [ wetboth ] .",
    "although these rely on significantly more uncertain assumptions than the dry merger model , they show that star formation can produce interesting values of @xmath101 in the @xmath47 and @xmath103 cases .",
    "figure [ cdfboth ] shows how the delay until the first post - kick disruptions changes with black hole mass and kick velocity .",
    "here we consider the joint core - cusp model ( with removal of pre - merger loss cone by the binary ) , and find that the first disruption is expected to occur between two and five decades after smbh coalescence for black holes with masses between @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and kick velocities between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "fortunately , this region of parameter space falls within both the black hole mass range lisa is likely to observe , and the range of physically plausible recoil velocities for dry mergers .",
    "we find that merging galaxies with black hole masses @xmath108 are likely to produce a tidal disruption flare a few decades after coalescence in the case of a gas - poor merger .",
    "multiple flares could possibly be seen on a timescale of years if resonant migration is effective . for gas - poor mergers ,",
    "the peak rate is therefore at least @xmath9 times higher than the typical tde rate in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the total number of tdes is maximized , and delay until the first tde minimized , if the kick velocity is in the range of @xmath109@xmath110 .",
    "our minimal predictions concerning dry mergers could be dramatically enhanced if resonant migration increases the number and frequency of post - kick tidal disruptions .",
    "the case of wet mergers is substantially more complicated , and because star formation and disk migration can also significantly increase the population of the post - kick loss cone , a much more detailed study of star - disk interactions around binary smbhs is needed to make robust predictions in the gas - rich case .",
    "moderate to high kick velocities in dry mergers will provide a robust em counterpart to the gw signature of black hole coalescence within the lisa band , enabling accurate identification of the host galaxy and a precise measurement of cosmological parameters @xcite within a few decades of the initial gw signal . with the advent of massive transient surveys , such as ptf , pan - starrs , and lsst , it is possible that sequential tidal disruption flares could flag black hole",
