    "one of the main goals of theoretical physics during the past 40 years is to understand quantum systems involving many particles .",
    "once the interaction between those particles were taken into account , the problem becomes complicated .",
    "meanwhile , as long as their interaction is not sufficient weak , the perturbative methods that were powerful in many quantum mechanics text book become unreliable . in one dimension ,",
    "various non - perturbative methods were proposed , among which the impact of exactly solvable theoretical models are undeniable .",
    "particles with @xmath0-function interaction is a simple but interesting model .",
    "lieb and liniger @xcite first solved a bose system under periodic boundary condition in the case of spin-@xmath5 or in the absence of internal degree of freedom .",
    "the method they used is nowadays referred as coordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "the extension of periodic boundary condition to the boundary condition of potential well of infinite depth were made by gaudin@xcite and woynarivich@xcite .",
    "the first attempt to develop the method applied in @xcite to deal with spin-1/2 fermions was made by mcguire@xcite who can , however , deal with the case of only one spin - down and the other spins keep up .",
    "further step of considering two spin - down and others spin - up was made by flicker and lieb@xcite .",
    "gaudin@xcite and yang @xcite successfully solved the problem for arbitrary number of spins in the state of spin - down . in yang s paper@xcite , the first non - trivial case of yang - baxter equation was introduced .",
    "actually , the strategy for general multi - component systems was proposed in @xcite though the explicit solution was give only for spin-1/2 particles ( it is fermi system then ) .",
    "the literature in @xcite was later extended by sutherland@xcite to the called any irreducible representation of permutation group .",
    "actually , both yang and sutherland adopted antisymmetric wave function under permutating indistinguishable particles .",
    "thus yang solved the problem of 2-component fermions and sutherland solved n - component fermions by means of coordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "as 2-component system is mostly associated with  spin-1/2 \" system which is conventionally referred to fermi system , the coordinate bethe ansatz has not been employed to 2-component bose systems till recently @xcite .",
    "along with the developments of quantum inverse scattering method , kulish@xcite discussed multi - component nonlinear schrdinger equation in terms of quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) in order to re - derive the bethe - ansatz equations of yang@xcite and sutherland@xcite .",
    "the author explicitly formulated 2-component case and conjectured that sutherland s results would be obtained by repeating his procedure @xmath6 times .",
    "actually , it is not possible because the author@xcite adopted commutation ( instead of anti - commutation ) relations but the system both yang and sutherland considered is fermi system .",
    "it is now clear that the first quantization form of the system which kulish considered ought to be a system of su(n ) bosons with @xmath0-function interaction .",
    "the qism was also employed to nonlinear schrdinger equation for graded matrix but it breaks the yang - baxter relation at first @xcite that was noticed and overcome later on @xcite .    although the bethe - ansatz equations for 2-component bosons was early formulated by kulish , the nature of ground state and the property of low - lying excitations has never been exposed till the paper of li _ et .",
    "we know that not only the 2-component bose gas can be formed in magnetically trapped @xmath7@xcite , but also a 3-component bose gas can be produced in an optically trapped @xmath8@xcite , it will be valuable to study the model of 3-component bose system . in present paper , we study a system of three - component bosons with su(3 ) symmetry in one dimension . on the basis of bethe - ansatz equations ,",
    "we discuss the ground state , low - lying excited states and the thermodynamics of the system at finite temperature , and try to obtain thermal coefficients for some special cases .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the following section we introduce the model and the corresponding bethe - ansatz equations for charge rapidity and color rapidities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ground ] , we explicitly show that the ground state is a color ferromagnetic state and how the quantum numbers in bethe - ansatz equations should be taken for the ground state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : low ] , we study the low - lying excited states extensively by analyzing the possible variations in the sequence of quantum numbers .",
    "numerical results of energy momentum spectra for each excitation are given .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion relation of four possible elementary particles are obtained .",
