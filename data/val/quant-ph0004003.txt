    "[ basic ] we know that quantum - state transformation at amplifying four - port devices is connected with su(2,2 ) group transformations . for each frequency",
    ", the transformation corresponds to the action of a four - mode squeezing operator , where the destruction ( creation ) operators of the field modes are mixed with the creation ( destruction ) operators of the device excitations .",
    "tracing with regard to the device variables then yields the ( two - mode ) output state of the field , as is shown in the appendix for the case where the ( two - mode ) input state of the field is a fock state and the device is in the ground state .",
    "if the input field is prepared in an entangled state , amplification is expected to destroy the entanglement .",
    "although all necessary formulas are available , the calculation of the quantum relative entropy is an effort .",
    "the number of the ( real ) parameters specifying an arbitrary separable density matrix increases dramatically with the dimension of the hilbert space of the subsystems involved .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that this number is @xmath197 $ ] , with @xmath198 being the hilbert - space dimension of the subsystems ( here , both subsystems are assumed to have equal dimensions )",
    ". hence , when there is notable amplification , then the number of fock states to be taken into account for sufficient numerical accuracy drastically increases .",
    "in contrast to absorbing media , where the dimension of the hilbert space of the relevant modes is bounded by the total number of input photons , such a bound does not exist for amplifying media .    nevertheless , for entangled gaussian states an upper bound of the gain can be determined such that the amplified system is still not separable .",
    "let us consider , e.g. , the two - mode squeezed vacuum ( [ sqvac2 ] ) and assume that the two modes travel through amplifying devices at zero temperature .",
    "the wigner function of the two - mode squeezed vacuum is a gaussian @xmath199 here , @xmath200 is a four - vector whose elements are @xmath201 , and @xmath202 is the @xmath203 variance matrix @xmath204 the variance matrix ( [ amp3 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath205 [ @xmath206 @xmath11 @xmath207 , @xmath55 @xmath11 @xmath208 . using the input - output relations ( [ 2.4 ] ) for amplifying devices",

    "horodecki criterion @xcite @xmath217 then tells us that for @xmath218 @xmath11 @xmath57 ) , eq .",
    "( [ amp8 ] ) reveals that the upper limit of the gain for which nonseparability changes to separability is simply given by the squeezing parameter @xmath176 , @xmath219 an obvious consequence of eq .",
    "( [ amp9 ] ) is that entanglement can not be produced from the vacuum by amplification . since for the vacuum the squeezing parameter has to be set equal to zero , @xmath169 @xmath11 @xmath57 , from eq .",
    "( [ amp9 ] ) it follows that any nonvanishing gain @xmath220 must necessarily lead to a separable state .",
    "we have studied the problem of quantum - state transformation at absorbing and amplifying dielectric four - port devices , without making use of any replacement schemes .",
    "we instead express the input  output relations in terms of the actually observed quantities as obtained from the quantized maxwell field in the presence of arbitrary causal ( linear ) media .",
    "after extending the basic formulas recently developed for absorbing media to amplifying media , we have applied the theory to some problems typically considered in quantum information processing .",
    "in particular , we have considered both the amount of entanglement that is realized when nonclassical light is combined through a lossy beam splitter and the entanglement degradation when entangled light propagates through lossy media .",
    "we have based our analysis on the quantum relative entropy as a measure of entanglement .",
    "the calculation of the entanglement of a mixed quantum state typically observed for absorbing media needs comparing the state with all separable states in order to find that separable state which is closest to the state under consideration .",
    "since the effort drastically increases with the dimension of the hilbert space , we have restricted our attention to low - dimensional quantum states in the numerical calculation .",
    "the numerical results show that the bell - type states @xmath123 , eq .  ( [ trans0 ] ) , are more robust against decoherence than the states @xmath166 , eq .",
    "( [ trans0a ] ) ( @xmath127 @xmath11 @xmath12 ) .",
    "the estimation of an upper bound of entanglement for arbitrary number @xmath127 of photons in each of the two entangled modes shows that with increasing @xmath127 the characteristic length of entanglement degradation decreases as @xmath221 at least , where @xmath222 is the absorption length according to the lambert  beer law .",
    "so far we have considered either purely absorbing or purely amplifying media . in practice",
    ", the two effects can occur simultaneously . essentially , there are two ways to deal with this problem .",
    "one way is to treat amplifiers with absorption as cascading amplifying and absorbing devices .",
    "another way is to go back to the underlying quantized maxwell equations with the aim to develop a more specific approach to the problem .",
