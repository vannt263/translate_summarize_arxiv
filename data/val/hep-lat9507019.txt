    "in our previous paper devoted to the mean - field analysis of the phase structure of the higgs - yukawa systems @xcite we have concluded that intersection of the critical line separating the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and paramagnetic ( pm ) phases with the line separating the antiferromagnetic ( am ) and pm phases always leads to appearing the ferrimagnetic ( fi ) phase , and that the slopes of the critical lines in the point of their intersection ( denote it @xmath0 has been employed in @xcite for another point . ] ) are continuous .",
    "these statements have been criticized recently in @xcite where it was argued that the slopes are in general discontinuous and that the fi phase may not appear at all in the point @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that in reference to the systems considered in @xcite this criticism is justified only in part .",
    "namely , considering within the mean - field approximation the weak coupling regime for the u(1 ) systems we show that in all the cases when the intersection of the fm - pm and am - pm critical lines occurs , the fi phase does appear , and that the slope of the am - pm  fi - fm line is always continuous .",
    "the reason for the latter fact is that the critical exponents of the magnetization ( v.e.v . of the higgs field ) in this approximation is grater than @xmath1 .",
    "the slope of the fm - pm  fi - am line generally changes in the point @xmath0",
    ". however the magnitude of this change depends strongly on the number of the fermion flavours .",
    "we show that for given system ( form of the lattice fermion action ) there exists such number @xmath2 ( generally noninteger ) , that for the number of the fermion flavours @xmath3 the slope of this line is continuous , too .",
    "the qualitative picture for the phase diagrams is shown in fig .",
    "1 . by a product",
    ", we find that in the fi phase in the vicinity of the point @xmath0 the magnetization and the staggered magnetization align orthogonally to each other in the group space .",
    "we want to emphasize that all the results of @xcite concerning the phase structure of the systems in the regions bordering on the pm phase are not affected .",
    "the slopes of the critical lines in those regions are determined by the terms in the free energy quadratic in the mean fields .",
    "such terms has been calculated in the ladder approximation developed in @xcite . for examination of",
    "the region bordering on the fi phase one needs to know the free energy up to the fourth order in the mean fields @xcite . in this case",
    "the summation of the ladder diagrams becomes too complicated and the approximation loses its advantages . at the same time , unjustified neglecting the ladder diagrams may lead to obviously incorrect results : for example , in the case of the su(2 ) system with the naive fermions the fi phase gets lost .",
    "therefore we consider here the u(1 ) systems for which the ladder diagrams do not contribute to the free energy at least up to the terms quadratic in the mean fields .",
    "we limit ourselves to the consideration of the weak coupling regime ; the examination of the strong coupling regime can be done easily in analogous way .",
    "our basic point is that the free energy for the u(1 ) systems in four dimensions up to terms quartic in the mean fields has the form ( all the notations as in @xcite ) @xmath4 where coefficients @xmath5 to @xmath6 are functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10",
    ".    the coefficients @xmath5 to @xmath11 and @xmath12 are calculated directly from the eqs .",

    "the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath18 in ( 1 ) can not be calculated by the term - wise integration of the standard weak coupling expansion of the logarithm of the fermion determinant : the integrals of the @xmath19 terms beginning from @xmath20 have infrared divergences , since @xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "this is the reason for appearing the logarithmic term in ( 1 ) .",
    "it it this term that differs our results from those of ref .",
    "@xcite .    to estimate the coefficient @xmath6 , note that the contribution of the fermion determinant to the free energy at @xmath23 is given by the expression @xmath24.\\ ] ]",
    "the integral is finite and certainly depends on the form of the function @xmath25 .",
    "the point , however , is that the term @xmath26 comes from the infrared region @xmath27 which is not sensitive to the detailed form of the function @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , to find the coefficient @xmath6 we can consider the integral with the same infrared properties @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an ultraviolet cutoff . from",
    "( 4 ) , taking into account the relation @xmath30 , we find @xmath31    since we are interested in the domain of the phase diagram where both @xmath32 and @xmath33 tend to zero , and therefore @xmath34 , one can neglect the term @xmath35 in ( 1 ) .",
    "the fm - pm and am - pm critical lines are determined by the equations @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , so that the coordinates of the point @xmath0 are @xmath38 } , \\quad y^{2}_{b } = \\frac{1}{n_f [ g(0 ) + g(\\pi)]}.\\ ] ]    in the vicinity of the point @xmath0 we have ( in the notations of @xcite ) @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 or @xmath42 .    from ( 2 ) and ( 5 )",
    "it follows that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "hence , in the fi phase ( if it exists ) the mean fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 align in such a way that @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. orthogonally to each other in the group space .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of the point @xmath0 the expression ( 1 ) for the free energy is reduced to @xmath47   \\ , h^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } [ b_{\\kappa } ( \\kappa - \\kappa_b ) + b_y ( y - y_b ) ]   \\ , h^{2}_{st } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox{}+ \\frac{1}{4 } c_b \\ , h^2 h^{2}_{st } + \\frac{1}{24 } e_b \\ , h^{4}_{st } + \\frac{1}{24 } f_b \\ , h^4 \\ln h^2 + o(\\delta^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 . from ( 9 ) necessary conditions for the existence of the fi phase",
    "follow : @xmath49 ( provided @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) . hence , quite near the point b , where @xmath52 , the fi phase can exist in fact at any value of the coefficient @xmath53 . from ( 5 ) it follows that the third condition in ( 10 ) is satisfied always , and we shall demonstrate in the next section that the second condition for the systems considered in @xcite is satisfied , too .",
    "now , following the consideration of ref .",
    "@xcite setting up the relation between the slopes of the critical lines and the critical exponents of the magnetizations , one can easily find the slopes at the point @xmath0 .",
    "consider first the @xmath54 critical line .",
    "near the point @xmath0 it is determined by the equation @xmath55 from ( 9 ) it follows that nonzero value of the staggered magnetization is determined by the equation @xmath56.\\ ] ] then , from ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , in full correspondence with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath57    the things are different in the case of the @xmath23 critical line .",
    "indeed , though this line is determined by the equation similar to ( 11 ) : @xmath58 the nonzero value of the magnetization is determined by the equation ( @xmath59 ) @xmath60.\\ ] ] from ( 16 ) it follows that @xmath61 , i.e. the critical exponents of the magnetization is grater than @xmath1 .",
    "therefore we have in this case @xmath62 i.e. the slope of the @xmath23 critical line does not change in the point @xmath0 .",
    "it is seen now that the fi phase appears always , provided the conditions ( 10 ) are fulfilled .",
    "the change of the slope of the @xmath54 critical line in the point @xmath0 is determined mainly by the value of @xmath53 : if @xmath63 the slope does not change ; if @xmath64 the domain with the fi phase gets narrow and in the limit @xmath65 it shrinks ; on the contrary , if @xmath66 the domain with the fi phase becomes wider and in the limit @xmath67 it occupies near the point @xmath0 all the region between the fi - fm and am - pm lines ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    we shall demonstrate now that all the three variants : @xmath63 , @xmath68 , and @xmath66 are realised for the systems considered in @xcite .",
    "the fm - pm and am - pm lines intersect in three of those systems : in the systems with the slac , weyl , and the mirror fermion actions . in these cases we have : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 for the slac action ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 for the weyl action ; @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 for the mirror fermion action ( the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given in @xcite ) .",
    "although @xmath80 depends on the number of flavours @xmath81 , in all these cases @xmath82 for any @xmath81 and therefore the fi phase appears in all of these systems .",
    "the sign and the value of @xmath53 however depends strongly on @xmath81 : this is due to the fact that the @xmath83 and @xmath84 terms in @xmath53 are independent of @xmath81 , while the @xmath85 terms are @xmath86 . moreover , for given system there exists such number @xmath2 , that @xmath63 if @xmath3 , @xmath87 if @xmath88 , and @xmath66 if @xmath89 . for our systems",
    "we find : @xmath90 the corresponding phase diagrams are shown qualitatively in fig",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that in the u(1 ) higgs - yukawa systems with the slac , weyl , or mirror fermion actions the fi phase does appear in the weak coupling regime in the point @xmath0 . in the fi phase ,",
    "at least quite near this point , the magnetization @xmath32 and the staggered magnetization @xmath33 align orthogonally to each other in the group space .",
    "due to the fact that the free energy involves the logarithmic term , that , in turn , leads to the critical exponents of the magnetization @xmath32 grater than @xmath1 , the @xmath23 critical line ( the am - pm  fi - fm line ) is continuous together with its first derivative in the point @xmath0 .",
    "the derivative of the @xmath54 critical line ( fm - pm  fi - am line ) is generally discontinuous in the point @xmath0 .",
    "however the discontinuity depends strongly on the number of the fermion flavours @xmath81 , so that in each system there exist such number @xmath2 , that for @xmath3 the line is smooth , too .    to conclude ,",
    "note that for the systems in which one has @xmath91 ( as it is , for example , for the naive fermions ) , the logarithmic terms in the free energy appear also for the staggered magnetization .",
    "this means that the critical exponents for both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are grater than @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in the cases when the fm - pm and am - pm lines intersect in such systems , the slopes of both critical lines are continuous in the point @xmath0 .",
    "this may occur , for example , in the case of the su(2 ) system with the naive fermions .",
    "we admit , however , that to make definite conclusion on the existence of the fi phase in the su(2 ) systems a special investigation is necessary .",
