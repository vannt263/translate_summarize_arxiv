    "in the expanding field of molecular magnetism , photomagnetism has considerable import as it affords the possibility of magnetic switching with the aid of light . in the photomagnetic systems that we have studied here , the system before shining light is essentially paramagnetic , with negligible exchange interaction between the magnetic ions .",
    "shining a burst of light of appropriate wavelength takes the system to a state in which there is a superexchange interaction between the paramagnetic ions .",
    "the photo - induced high - spin state is long lived at low temperatures , however , warming the system takes it back to the paramagnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "there also exist extended systems in which the photoinduced exchange mechanism gives rise to magnetic ordering ; this unusual photo - effect is called the photo induced phase transition ( pipt ) @xcite .",
    "the above phenomenon is quite distinct from the spin state transition observed in many inorganic complexes , wherein shining light leads to change in the ratio of the population of the low - spin ( ls ) state to that in the high - spin ( hs ) state .",
    "this phenomenon called the light induced excited spin state trapping ( liesst ) , has been extensively studied in spin crossover complexes @xcite .",
    "these systems lie very close to the spin crossover point in the tanabe - sugano diagram @xcite .",
    "when the system is excited by light , the non - radiative decay from the excited state occurs through intersystem crossings to the two nearly degenerate low energy states of different spin @xcite . to recover the pure low - spin ground state",
    ", it would become necessary to warm the system and cool it to low temperatures .",
    "this phenomenon does not involve any magnetic exchange interactions between the transition metal ions .",

    "the t@xmath7 increased to 19k .",
    "besides , at fixed magnetic field and fixed temperature , the net magnetization increased upon irradiation .",
    "this increase in t@xmath7 and magnetization are attributed to electron transfer from the diamagnetic @xmath8 to the diamagnetic @xmath9 brought about by irradiation resulting in @xmath10 ion with spin 1/2 and @xmath11 ion with spin 3/2 @xcite .",
    "these paramagnetic ions , besides contributing to an increase magnetization , also establish pathways for exchange which were blocked in the diamagnetic state , thereby increasing the t@xmath7 .",

    "if the new vb diagram violates rumer - pauling rules , it is trivially possible to express it as a linear combination of the basis vb states .    using the above procedure",
    ", the hamiltonian matrix can be set - up in the chosen total spin sector .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian matrix is sparse ( since the number of terms in the hamiltonian is far smaller than the dimension of the vb complete space ) and nonsymmetric matrix and can be partially diagonalized to obtain a few of the low - lying eigenstates , using rettrup s modification of the davidson algorithm @xcite . in some cases , full diagonalization of the matrices is resorted to obtain the complete eigenvalue spectrum . in our case , since the dimensionalities of the different subspaces are fairly small , we have resorted to complete diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrices in each spin sector .    in the present problem ,",
    "the quantities of interest are the optical gaps in each spin sector and the transition dipoles for these transitions .",
    "to understand the nature of the excited states , it is also important to know the spin and charge density distributions in these states . computing many of these quantities is simpler in the constant @xmath57 basis . hence , we transform eigenstates in the valence bond basis to the constant @xmath57 basis and carry out all these calculations .",
    "we have extensively explored the properties of the model over a wide range of parameters , specifically , we have studied the model at discrete values of the parameters in the following ranges : 4 ev @xmath58 6 ev , 0.5 ev @xmath59 2.0 ev , -0.2 ev @xmath60 -0.5 ev , 0.0 ev @xmath61 0.3 ev , 0.5 ev @xmath62 1.5 ev , 0.5 ev @xmath63 1.5 ev with @xmath64 .",

    "the interelectron repulsion integral involving the d orbitals on @xmath20 , ( @xmath67 ) is slightly less than the intra - orbital repulsions .",
    "we expect the integral @xmath68 to be larger than @xmath69 , and both are expected to be significantly smaller than the @xmath70 type repulsion integrals that involve repulsion between two electron densities , each one located in a single orbital",
    ". the orbital energy of the @xmath20 @xmath24 orbitals could be slightly smaller than the @xmath21 @xmath25 orbital energy since @xmath20 has a higher atomic number .",

    "the near degeneracy of these `` covalent '' spin states ensures that the behaviour for @xmath76 corresponds to that of six free spins on the @xmath1 ions .",

    "when we have the @xmath78 configuration on @xmath20 and all the copper ions in @xmath79 configuration , we have a total of 384 states .",
    "this corresponds to six ways of occupying two electrons in the two @xmath24 orbitals and sixty four spin configurations of the six spins on the six @xmath1 ions . for the model employed by us",
    ", the lowest energy state corresponds to the lower of the orbitals on @xmath20 being doubly occupied , for @xmath80 , ignoring the off - diagonal contributions from the @xmath68 and @xmath69 terms .",
    "the effect of the off - diagonal @xmath68 and @xmath69 terms is ( i ) to favour double occupancy on the lower energy @xmath20 orbital and ( ii ) to favour parallel spin alignment when these orbitals are singly occupied .",
    "corresponding to this occupancy , five states with total spin s=0 , nine states with total spin s=1 , five states with total s=2 and one state with total spin s=3 are all degenerate .",
    "there is only one s=4 state which is 0.671 ev above the ground state and corresponds to single occupancy of each orbital with all spins aligned in parallel .",
    "these states span all the 64 spin configurations corresponding to six spin-1/2 objects ; since all these states are degenerate to within a few degree k , the paramagnetic behaviour observed in the system before irradiation is reproduced for small values of @xmath26 .",
    "the theoretical fit to experimental data for two different values of the transfer integral is shown in fig .",

    "the next set of states corresponds to single occupancy of each of the @xmath20 orbitals .",
    "if the spins of the electrons in these orbitals are parallel , the states will have a lower energy than if they are antiparallel .",
    "there are in all 256 such states of which 128 states have parallel spin alignment and another 128 states have antiparallel spin alignment .",
    "the remaining sixty four of the 384 states have a double occupancy in the higher energy @xmath20 orbital .",
    "these 384 states form the low energy spectrum when @xmath65 is significantly larger than @xmath81 so that the intersite interactions do not alter the picture .",
    "the most important point to note is that since the low - energy states all have identical charge distribution , the transition dipole matrix elements between these states are zero and this result holds even when @xmath82 .",
    "the virtual excited state resulting from the electron transfer shown in ( a ) has a lower energy than those shown in ( b ) and ( c ) , because of the hund s rule . the superexchange process in ( a ) favours s=3 state , and in ( b ) an s=2 state .",
    "the process ( b ) is preferred over ( a ) if the splitting of the orbitals on the @xmath20 site as well as @xmath67 are large . in all the figures ,",
    "the two orbitals in the center are the @xmath20 orbitals and the six peripheral orbitals are the @xmath21 orbitals.,width=288,height=432 ]    the higher energy excited states of the system involve charge - transfer ( ct ) from the @xmath2 ion to @xmath1 resulting in a state with a large weight for the @xmath83 configurations .",
    "these states are found at about 3 ev above the ground state .",
    "these excitations have nonzero transition dipole to the ground state .",
    "one of the most important features of this excitation is that , in the excited state there is considerable weight for the basis state with singly occupied @xmath20 site .",
    "the singly occupied @xmath84 site favours virtual electron transfer from the @xmath1 sites , of electrons which have the same spin orientation as the unpaired @xmath84 electron , because of the hund s rule .",
    "the virtual transfer of an electron from @xmath1 with its spin orientation same as that already present on @xmath84 is favoured as long as ( i ) the @xmath28-orbitals on @xmath20 are nearly degenerate and ( ii ) the inter - orbital @xmath85 repulsion , on @xmath20 is weaker than the intra - orbital repulsion ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this feature contributes to stabilizing the high - spin ct excitation relative to the low - spin excitations . in fig",
    "[ figexcited ] we show the possible pathways for superexchange in this state .",
    "the factor which favours stabilization of the low - spin state is the large number of pathways that exist for the delocalization of electrons in the low - spin state , compared to the high - spin states . in our case , there are 1764 singlets and 2352 triplets while there are only 63 s=3 states .",
    "the splitting of the states with different spins in the ct state is thus a competition between direct exchange which stabilizes the high - spin state and the kinetic exchange which favours the low - spin state due to the availability of a larger phase space for electron delocalization .",

    "density of states versus energy in s=0,1,2 and 3 subspaces .",

    "this factor would contribute to a lowering of the s=2 ct excited state relative to ct excited states with spin s@xmath892 .",
    "however , the final outcome depends on both the direct exchange and the kinetic exchange contributions .",
    "thus , it is again difficult to predict which of the spin states is a low - energy ct excited state .",
    "we see all the above scenarios in our calculations , when we widely vary the model parameters .",
    "the above picture is slightly altered by the long - range interactions in the model .",
    "these interactions depend upon the occupancies of the @xmath20 site as well as all the @xmath21 sites and are significant since the molecular complex is insulating and screening of these interactions is not significant . together with a nonzero transfer integral , the long - range interactions complicate the picture while retaining the general physical features outlined above .",

    "[ figdos ] for the full spectrum of the model in each total spin sector .",
    "we find ct excitations at about 2.993 ev in all the spin sectors .",
    "the energies and magnitude of the transition dipole vectors from the ground state are given in table [ tabtdip ] .",
    "we also present in table [ tabtdip ] , the degeneracy of states as well as the charge and spin density on the @xmath20 site .",
    "we note that in all the states located at this energy , independent of the total spin , the charge density on the @xmath20 site is one .",
    "what is interesting is that while the energies of these states as well as the charge density on the @xmath20 site are all the same , the transition dipole moment is largest for the s=3 states .",
    "this fact , coupled with the high degeneracy of the state implies that the s=3 states have the largest absorption to the ct excited state .",
    "an important difference between the s=3 eigenvalue spectrum and eigenvalue spectra of other spin states is that the dos in the former is very dispersed and the states are far apart in energy , when not degenerate .",
    "this has implications for the life - time of the excited states . in the s=0 ,",
    "1 and 2 spaces , there are an order of magnitude more states near the ct excitation gap of 2.993 ev compared with the s=3 states at this energy .",
    "thus , other spin states have pathways for internal conversion leading to rapid de - excitation of the ct state .",
    "this is less likely in the s=3 state . for this reason , the s=3 excited state",
    "has a longer life - time and can be observed in the photomagnetism experiments .",
    "one feature that is however missed in our studies is the computation of the equilibrium geometry in the ct excited state specifically around the @xmath90 site that may play a crucial role in increasing the life - time of the state .",
    "this is rather hard to incorporate in our model wherein the ligand atoms are completely neglected .",
    "it is possible that the ct excited state with s=3 is more distorted ( relative to the ground state ) than similar states with different total spin .",
    "this could further enhance the life - time of the s=3 ct excitation .",
    "for the sake of completeness , it is worth mentioning that there are also different kinds of charge transfer excited states at much higher energies corresponding to electron transfer from the @xmath1 site to the @xmath2 site , charge transfer between @xmath1 sites and so forth for which the transition dipole moments are nonzero .",
    "however , these states occur at a much higher energy and are not excited by laser light at 3ev .",
    "the model developed in this paper is specific to the isolated molecular complex we have studied .",
    "however , this model also throws light on the mechanism leading to the observed ferromagnetism in the pipt systems .",
    "while the degeneracy of the different optically excited spin states is not significantly affected by the exchange mechanism operative in the optically excited state , the long life - time of the high - spin state could be responsible for the observed ferromagnetism in extended systems .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a model for the photomagnetism in the heptanuclear complex , @xmath0^{8+}$ ] perchlorate which involves the six partly filled @xmath25 orbital on the @xmath1 sites and two lowest energy @xmath24 orbitals on the @xmath2 site .",
    "besides the site energies of the orbitals and the transfer integrals between the @xmath21 and @xmath20 orbitals , we introduce on - site and extended range interactions between the various sites . on the @xmath20 site ,",
    "we consider all the three types of two electron integrals involving the @xmath20 orbitals . using this model , we compute the full eigenvalue spectrum , the transition dipoles with the ground state , spin and charge densities for all the states in each of the spin sectors by exactly solving the model in a spin conserving valence bond basis .",
    "our studies show that the ground state is sixty four fold degenerate with an unpaired electron on each @xmath21 site .",
    "this leads to the observed paramagnetic susceptibility prior to irradiation , of six non - interacting spin-1/2 objects per formula unit .",
    "the excited states to which there is nonzero transition dipole in each spin sector are located at about 2.993 ev ( for the values of the parameter we have chosen ) in each of the spin sectors .",
    "the number of states at this energy as well as the transition dipole moment for the transition are highest for the s=3 states .",
    "there also exist very few states in the s=3 sector below this energy , thereby introducing a bottle - neck for its internal conversion for non - radiative decay to the ground state .",
    "there may also occur changes in the geometry of the complex in the excited state which renders a low frank - condon factor for radiative decay .",
    "thus , the observed post radiation magnetic behaviour of the complex with 75% of the molecules in the s=3 state can be rationalized by our model .",

    "<S> a theoretical model for understanding photomagnetism in the heptanuclear complex @xmath0^{8+}$ ] perchlorate is developed . </S>",
    "<S> it is a many - body model involving the active orbitals on the transition metal ions . </S>",
    "<S> the model is exactly solved using a valence bond approach . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state solution of the model is highly degenerate and is spanned by five s=0 states , nine s=1 states , five s=2 states and one s=3 state . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital occupancies in all these states correspond to six @xmath1 ions and one diamagnetic @xmath2 ion . </S>",
    "<S> the optically excited charge - transfer ( ct ) state in each spin sector occur at nearly the same excitation energy of 2.993 ev for the physically reasonable parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of the ct states is largest in the s=3 sector and so is the transition dipole moment from the ground state to these excited states . </S>",
    "<S> thus laser irradiation with light of this energy results in most intense absorption in the s=3 sector . </S>",
    "<S> the life - time of the s=3 excited states is also expected to be the largest as the number of states below that energy is very sparse in this spin sector when compared to other spin sectors . </S>",
    "<S> these twin features of our model explain the observed photomagnetism in the @xmath0^{8+}$ ] complex .    </S>",
