    "when studying the transmission of optical waves through random media one may consider fluctuations in the _",
    "optical conductance_. analogous to the electronic conductance , this quantity is obtained when , first , the incoming beam is monochromatic and diffuse , and second , all outgoing light is collected .",
    "since the electronic conductance is known to exhibit so called universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) , the same fluctuations are expected in the optical conductance .",
    "measurements of this quantity would constitute a cornerstone in the analogy between optical and electronic mesoscopic systems .",
    "we briefly review the situation for mesoscopic electron systems@xcite .",
    "the electronic conductance of mesoscopic samples is known to show reproducible sample to sample fluctuations .",
    "since the fluctuations are a consequence of scattering from static impurities , they are static .",
    "their magnitude is independent of the sample parameters such as the mean free path , the sample thickness and the average conductance .",
    "hence they are called universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "the mean conductance in the considered regime comes from multiple scattered diffuse electrons .",
    "the ucf are a consequence of interference of multiple scattered waves , causing correlations between two diffuse paths .",
    "therefore the fluctuations are much larger then one would obtain classically by modeling the system by a random resistor array , in which interference effects are neglected .",
    "that approach is valid only on a length scale exceeding the phase coherence length , where the fluctuations reduce to their classical value .",
    "the conductance fluctuates when the phases of the waves in the dominant paths are changed .",
    "this happens , of course , if one changes the position of the scatterers , eq . by taking another sample",
    "one may also keep the scatterers fixed but apply a magnetic field or vary the fermi energy .",
    "( in optical system one can vary the frequency of the light . ) in all these cases one modifies the phases of scattered waves , so that different propagation paths become dominant .",
    "transport through mesoscopic systems is not only studied in electron systems , but also using multiple scattered classical waves such as sound , microwaves , and , particularly , light .",
    "the origin of the mesoscopic phenomena is the interference of multiple scattered waves and in first approximation all systems are described by the same equations , namely the scalar wave equation , see for instance van haeringen _",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "thus one expects that similar large fluctuations in optical systems are present in the diffuse transmission regime .",
    "an advantage of optical systems over electronic ones is that optical systems are much cleaner : no equivalents of phonons or electron - electron interactions are present .",
    "indeed very accurate measurements of the enhanced backscatter cone@xcite , correlation functions@xcite and intensity distributions@xcite were performed . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the optical analog of the ucf has not yet been observed in optical systems .",
    "such experiments turn out to be difficult .",
    "although the magnitude of the fluctuations is universal , they occur on a background of order @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the dimensionless conductance ( in optical experiments one typically has @xmath1 ) .",
    "the relative value of the fluctuations to the background is thus @xmath2 , so that the @xmath3 correlation function is of order @xmath4 , typically of order @xmath5 . for electrons",
    "this problem is absent as moderate values of @xmath0 are achievable .",
    "this is also the reason that electrons are easier brought near anderson localization , for which @xmath0 has to take a critical value of order unity .",
    "in the electronic case the moderate values of @xmath0 , combined with very sensitive techniques for current measurements , have led to many observations of the universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "recent optical experiments suggest , however , that the optical analog of ucf should just be experimentally accessible , as the measurement of the third cumulant in the total transmission was reported@xcite .",
    "this quantity is of the same order as the optical ucf , namely @xmath4 .",
    "it is expected that similar techniques can be applied to measure the optical ucf .",
    "microwave scattering is also interesting as it combines lower values of @xmath0 with many of the advantages of optical systems .",
    "we are not only interested in just the size of the fluctuations , but also in the somewhat more general frequency correlation .",
    "a change in the frequency alters the interference pattern , just as occurs by changing the magnetic field or the fermi energy in the electronic case .",
    "it is known from experiments that using the frequency as tunable parameter provides a good way for measuring the fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to electronic systems , in optical systems both angular resolved and angular integrated measurements of the transmission are possible .",
    "therefore various transmission quantities can be measured in optical systems , each with its particular frequency correlation function . in a recent review by berkovits and feng@xcite",
    "the different correlations and their physical interpretation are discussed extensively . denoting the transmission from incoming channel @xmath6 ( wave coming in under angles @xmath7 ) to outgoing channel @xmath8 ( waves transmitted into angles @xmath9 ) as @xmath10 , the correlation functions can be classified as @xcite @xmath11 the unity just comes from the product of averages .",
    "the @xmath12-term in the correlation function is the most important one if the angular resolved transmission @xmath10 is measured .",
    "the reason is that @xmath12 is of order unity when both the incoming directions @xmath6 and @xmath13 , and the outgoing directions @xmath8 and @xmath14 are , pairwise , close to each other .",
    "when dealing with one single monochromatic plane wave ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath12 describes the correlation of the bright and dark speckle pattern .",
    "diagrammatically , @xmath12 is the sum of all reducible diagrams , that is to say , just as the unit contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eqdefc ] ) , it is equal to the product of two averages .",
    "if instead of measuring light in one outgoing channel , all outgoing light is integrated , the sharply peaked and short ranged @xmath12 correlation function is overwhelmed . by collecting the outgoing light ,",
    "the total transmission @xmath16 is measured ; experimentally this is commonly done using an integrating sphere@xcite . in this setup the @xmath17 correlation function , which has a much smaller peak value but is long ranged , contributes for all outgoing angles and becomes dominant .",
    "its long range character arises because , due to interference of the diffuse light paths , the outgoing amplitudes are pairwise in phase .",
    "the @xmath17 correlation , which still depends on the angles of the incoming beams @xmath6 and @xmath13 , is of order @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath17 corresponds to a diagram where the two incoming diffusons interact through a hikami - vertex .    finally , the @xmath3 term is dominant when the incoming beam is diffuse , and all outgoing light is collected , so that , just as in electronic systems , the conductance @xmath19 is measured . in that measurement contributions where @xmath6 and @xmath13 are far apart are dominant .",
    "in contrast to previous case , now also these incoming amplitudes must be pairwise in phase .",
    "this occurs in a diagram where the two incoming diffusons interact twice , so that a loop occurs ; in principle , further loop insertions to it also contribute . in spite of the fact that @xmath3 is of order @xmath20",
    ", it is dominates over the @xmath12 and @xmath17 terms as it has contributions for all incoming and outgoing angles .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath17 correlation have been studied in detail , both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "it was also shown in experiments @xcite and in theory@xcite that absorption and internal reflection , neglected in the earliest calculations , significantly reduce the correlations . among other methods ,",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath17 correlation were successfully@xcite calculated using a diagrammatic technique based on the landauer approach@xcite .",
    "one might hope that the calculation of the @xmath3 or ucf in this approach is also straightforward .",
    "it is well known , however , that the calculation in the landauer approach is quite cumbersome , since divergencies show up on scales of one mean free path when the problem is treated on a macroscopic level using diffusons .    in order to circumvent these difficulties ,",
    "one is tempted to use the kubo approach , often used in electronical systems to calculate the ucf @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the results for the conductance obtained by kubo or landauer formalism should be identical@xcite . yet",
    "the kubo approach can not be applied directly to optical systems , since it is not clear how external lines should replace current vertices , and how absorption and internal reflections are to be included .",
    "therefore , we use the landauer approach .    technically , the difficulties in the landauer approach are caused by the vertices for partner exchange of two diffusons , the so - called hikami boxes .",
    "each hikami box brings the square of the internal momentum , whereas the current vertices are momentum - independent in the kubo formula . as a result",
    ", the integral over the internal momentum of the closed loop is convergent in the kubo formula , while naively divergent in landauer approach .",
    "two studies of the @xmath3 in the landauer approach are known to us . in the first , kane , serota and lee@xcite consider electronic systems and make elegantly use of current conservation to derive an expression for the correlation function .",
    "although in optical systems the conserved quantity is not the intensity but the energy , their prediction applies to optical systems as well , since it amounts to a result for the same sums of scattering diagrams , involving different parameters only .",
    "this result has not been confirmed by a direct derivation , however . moreover , since it relies on a conservation law , it is not clear what happens when absorption is present .",
    "the second study was performed by berkovits and feng@xcite . after giving a very clear discussion of the problem , these authors calculated one of the macroscopic diagrams ( presented earlier by feng , kane , lee and stone@xcite ) and subtracted the divergent parts by hand . in this way the correct order of magnitude and the qualitative frequency dependence was obtained .",
    "it is our goal to clarify the situation by calculating the optical @xmath3 diagrammatically .",
    "a complete analysis of all leading diagrams is needed , in which finally the divergent parts should cancel . we specialize to the case where the conductance is measured . in this setup",
    "the amplitudes of the incoming and outgoing diffusons are exactly in phase .",
    "if the @xmath3 correlation is measured as a ( small ) part of the correlation in the angular transmission or total transmission , this phase condition need not be full filled .",
    "other contributions of order @xmath4 which are angular dependent are then present .",
    "these contributions are both the diagrams presented below , with different decay rates for the incoming and outgoing diffusons , but also new diagrams contribute . in conductance measurements these complications do not occur .",
    "our fundamental approach immediately allows for inclusion of effects due to boundary layers and absorption .",
    "our calculations , although specialized to optical systems , are valid for any mesoscopic system .",
    "tacitly we assumed that higher order correlations can be neglected .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that for small @xmath21 the @xmath21th cumulants scale as @xmath22 , so that for @xmath23 the fluctuations have indeed a gaussian distribution ; the far tail of the distribution is predicted to be log - normal .",
    "it would be interesting , however , to determine the full distribution function of the fluctuations , as was done in experiment for the angular resolved transmission@xcite and the total transmission@xcite , and recently in theoretical work by nieuwenhuizen and van rossum@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the basics of the diagrammatic technique and describe diffuse transport of light . in section [ secset ] we present the long distance diagrams and analyze the divergencies arising from these diagrams in the diffusion approximation in [ secdifdiv ] .",
    "next , in section [ seckb ] we develop a kadanoff - baym theory in order to generate all relevant scattering diagrams . in section [ secshort ]",
    "we show that the divergencies indeed cancel if all diagrams are analyzed in detail .",
    "the general form of the fluctuations is calculated in section [ seclong ] and applied to optical systems , where absorption and internal reflections may be present .",
    "the presentation is closed with a discussion .",
    "in this section we discuss standard aspects of diffuse light transport , such as the amplitude greens function , the diffuse intensity and the transport equation .",
    "we shall consider the situation of point scatterers in a medium that has a dielectric constant different from its surroundings .",
    "we employ the notation and results of the paper by nieuwenhuizen and luck@xcite .",
    "the main results of the present section are the expression ( [ c3-f ] ) for the @xmath3 correlation function , and the expression ( [ c3-g ] ) for the universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "these expressions involve diagrams with incoming total - flux diffusons @xmath24 defined in ( [ totfluxladin ] ) , outgoing total - flux diffusons @xmath25 defined in ( [ totfluxladout ] ) , and internal diffusons @xmath26 defined in ( [ lint1 ] ) or ( [ lint2 ] ) .",
    "readers not interested in the microscopic background of these relations may skip the details of the present section .",
    "we consider a quasi - one , quasi - two , or three dimensional slab of thickness @xmath27 and area @xmath28 , with ( @xmath29 ) . which contains static , isotropic point scatterers .",
    "as usual a scalar approximation is made for the electromagnetic field of the light@xcite . for bulk properties",
    "this is justified since the polarization is scrambled after a few scattering events .",
    "for other applications , such as acoustic waves and spinless electrons , the scalar property is immediate .",
    "the scalar wave equation at given frequency @xmath30 reads @xmath31 where @xmath13 is the vacuum speed of light . we shall consider a medium with dielectric constant @xmath32 and density @xmath21 of small spheres with dielectric constant @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 , located at random positions @xmath35 .",
    "going to the limit of point scatterers we get    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the dielectric constant in the surrounding medium .",
    "the wave numbers in the surrounding medium and in the random medium are , @xmath38 respectively . in the bulk the average retarded greens function ( amplitude greens function ) in three dimensions with momentum @xmath39 reads @xmath40 for small scatterers the scattering becomes isotropic with an effective strength described by the @xmath41-matrix@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the bare scattering strength and @xmath44 is an internal parameter of the point scatterer .",
    "the mean free path is defined as @xmath45 in which @xmath21 is the scatterer density .",
    "the metallic mesoscopic regime is defined by : @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "eq.([eqdeft ] ) satisfies the optical theorem @xmath48 , where @xmath6 is the albedo of the scatterer .",
    "the case of no absorption , which we treat first , corresponds to @xmath49 . in electronic systems absorption",
    "does not take place , but a similar behavior arises from de - phasing ; in that case the phase coherence length plays the role of absorption length and , for our purpose , has to be larger than the system size .    for disordered electron systems",
    "one deals with weak @xmath50wave scattering and the diagrammatic expansion can be carried out in second order born approximation . in experiments on optical systems however , efficient scattering is achieved by taking resonant scatterers and strictly one now has to calculate the full born series@xcite . in the main part of this work we study how the cancellation of some short range contributions takes place .",
    "this we do in the second order born approximation , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "working with the full born series would introduce a large number of extra classes of diagrams so that the total number of diagrams increases dramatically .",
    "we expect , however , that the cancellation of divergencies , when shown in the second order born approximation , also holds if the full born series is considered .",
    "it is widely expected and confirmed in one of our earlier papers that for static quantities the difference between the two should only be a renormalization of the mean free path in the final results@xcite .",
    "we thus continue to work with the full born series where possible .",
    "the cancellation of short range divergencies will only be shown within the second order born approximation .",
    "intensity transport in transmission is dominated by ladder diagrams or diffusons .",
    "a diffuson is made up by pairing one retarded and one advanced propagator sharing the same path through the sample , as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figt1 ] .",
    "although the transport deep in the bulk is accurately described with the diffusion equation , the precise behavior near the ( reflecting ) surface has to be derived from the schwarzschild - milne integral - equation@xcite .",

    "this is described by ( [ greenfie ] ) since its pole lies slightly away from the real axis , due to the imaginary part of @xmath41 .",

    "the length @xmath75 is called the `` injection depth '' . for isotropic scattering one has@xcite @xmath76 .",
    "however , it becomes larger when there is a mismatch of the indices of refraction between the scattering medium and the surroundings@xcite .",
    "note that ( [ lain ] ) satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath77 ; the more complicated schwarzschild - milne equation is needed to fix the parameters of its solution .    in the electronic conductance measurements , however ,",
    "waves coming from all directions are involved . in the landauer formula for the conductance ,",
    "@xmath78 one needs to sum the transmission coefficients @xmath10 of waves with unit flux coming in channel @xmath6 and going out to channel @xmath8 . in an optical experiment , however , the incoming diffuse beam may have angular weights that differ by a factor of order unity . when using integrating spheres one measures the outgoing intensity , rather than the outgoing flux .",
    "as compared to the electronic case , it does not bring a factor @xmath79 to the weight of the outgoing channel . as these differences between electronic and optical measurements only lead to different numerical pre - factors , we calculate the optical ucf with the same weights as in the electronic case .",
    "summing ( [ sa ] ) over the channels @xmath6 yields a source for the diffuse intensity @xmath80 this is again the input in the schwarzschild - milne equation([eqmilne ] ) . in the bulk",

    "the outgoing total - flux diffuson in transmission therefore reads @xmath103 apart from a reflection , this expression differs by a factor 4 from ( [ totfluxladin ] )",
    ". the pre - factors would be the same if our greens functions were multiplied by a factor 2 ; this amounts to the same as taking a kinetic term @xmath104 rather than @xmath105 , such as occurs in electronics in units where @xmath106 .    for outgoing intensity in direction @xmath8",
    "one has , in analogy with ( [ tfaa ] ) , @xmath107 we call the incoming and outgoing diffusons , _ external _ diffusons , because they are connected to the outside of sample .",
    "this in contrast to the _ internal _ diffusons that begin and end at interference vertices inside the medium .",
    "away from the surface the internal diffusons obey the well known diffusion equation : @xmath108 .",
    "the result for the angle - resolved transmission of nieuwenhuizen and luck @xcite can be written as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the average conductance @xmath111 in dimensionless units .",

    "however , it does not contribute when this expression is summed over @xmath8 and @xmath14 , i.e. in total transmission .",

    "we can still assume that @xmath241 , as we do not need the physics on length scales comparable to the wavelength , but comparable to one mean free path only .",
    "the integrals needed in the calculation are given in table [ tabeli ] , where @xmath242 is an angular average defined as @xmath243 the integral for @xmath244 yields the diffuson kernel @xmath245 .",
    "the internal diffuson now reads @xmath246 we recover previous results by expansion in @xmath247 .",
    "this yield @xmath248 , agrees with the bulk solution of ( [ difeq ] ) .",
    "first , look at the long range diagrams with few scatterings . by writing out the dressing of the vertices one obtains the detailed structure of the diagrams , given in fig .",
    "[ figregdet ] . in the diagrams fig .",
    "[ figreg](a)i-(c)i , the incoming external diffusons are connected to 1 and 3 .",
    "the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figreg](a)ii-(c)ii are obtained by connecting external diffusons 1 and 2 to the incoming side .",
    "if such a diagram contains only a few scatterers , it can be grouped into one of the classes of the long range diagrams .",
    "a simple example is the upper left diagram of fig .",
    "[ figregdet ] , drawn there with six scatterers .",
    "interchanging the external diffusons numbered 2 and 3 clearly leads to another topology .",
    "however , with only two scatterers present , the topology does not change under this operation , and one must be careful not to overcount this term . bearing this important observation in mind , we sum all long range diagrams for an arbitrary number of scatterers . the expression for each diagram and its combinatorical factor is given in table  [ tablecom ] .",
    "it is convenient to collect diagrams with an equal number @xmath249 of scatterers that connect different propagators .",
    "scatterers on which one given amplitude scatters twice are thus , momentarily , not counted as new scatterers .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ figregdet ] , @xmath249 equals the total number of scatterers minus the number of scatterers indicated with curved lines . after this resummation",
    "we find the important result that each class of `` long range '' terms vanishes for @xmath249 not equal to 2 . denoting the terms of fig .",
    "[ figregdet ] respectively by @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 we find @xmath253 , if @xmath254 . if @xmath255 , the classes cancel against each other , since we then obtain @xmath256 .",
    "this implies @xmath257 we have thus shown that the long range diagrams for an infinite system cancel and thus cause no divergency after integration over @xmath258 .",
    "it is essential that the degeneracy of the low order contributions be counted properly .",
    "another , more standard way to verify the important cancellation is the following . recall that we look at a bulk situation with fixed internal momentum @xmath152 , while the external momenta are put equal zero . beyond the diffusion approximation an internal diffuson",
    "is given by eq.([eqladder2 ] ) .",
    "we also need the hikami - boxes beyond the diffusion approximation .",
    "it holds that @xmath259 inserting the values from the table and doing similar but longer calculations for two other vertices we find    @xmath260    now the long range diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figreg ] can be evaluated . for the internal part",
    "one has at fixed @xmath152 @xmath261 it is essential that the denominators @xmath262 have disappeared from this expression .",
    "as mentioned , it means that all high order terms cancel , allowing a cancellation of the remainder by low order contributions . from table",
    "[ tablecom ] it is seen that we have overcounted six types of low order terms .",
    "the correction to be subtracted is @xmath263 it indeed exactly cancels expression ( [ eqdiv2 ] ) , which arose as a remainder of the long range terms .    from the results of present section",
    "one may be tempted to conclude that the long range diagrams do not lead to divergencies if the correct degeneracies of the low order terms is properly taken into account .",
    "though this conclusion is correct , it is too early to draw it , since we show in next parts that some further complications arise .",
    "unfortunately , we have not yet finished with the calculation as also other terms are of leading order at short distances .",
    "first , diagrams with a different topology also occur .",
    "there are five new diagrams , all with two scatterers , see fig .",
    "[ figextra ] .",
    "they can be looked upon as diagrams from the set of fig .",
    "[ figregdet](a ) , but without any scatterers in the ladders .",
    "second , diagrams can have more than one configuration for a resonant arrangement of the momenta , i.e. several configurations can be leading .",
    "the most important contribution to the integral ( [ eqdefi ] ) arises if the _ amplitude _ loop momentum @xmath39 is close to the wavevector @xmath264 . with more loops",
    "present it is sometimes possible to find more than one choice for the momenta of the amplitude propagators .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figmom ] , where the diagram of fig .",
    "[ figregdet](a)1 is repeated .",
    "the expression for the shown diagram has contribution from three different poles .",
    "the first arrangement of the momenta is dominant for any number of scatterers , this one is part of the set of long range diagrams for any number of scatterers .",
    "the two configurations on the right give an extra leading contribution .",
    "this only occurs with two scatterers present ; with more scatterers the two diagrams on the right become subleading , and only the left diagram remains . apart from this diagram",
    ", the same thing occurs for the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figregdet](c)1 and fig .  [ figregdet](c)2 also with two scatterers , and for the diagram fig .",
    "[ figregdet](c)6 with three scatterers .",
    "also the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figextra ] have more than one pole : the four left diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figextra ] have two resonant momenta configurations , the right one has three .",
    "we sum all the contributions thus found ( 41 in total ) and denote them as @xmath265 for @xmath21 scatterers .",

    "apart from the diagrams generated by the kadanoff - baym approach , we found another class of leading long range diagrams when we generated the diagrams by computer . in these diagrams",
    "the two diffusons have two scatterers in common , but no amplitude is exchanged .",
    "they either have one internal diffuson , see fig .",
    "[ figmbox1 ] or two , see fig .",
    "[ figmbox2 ] .",
    "these diagrams are actually of similar type as fig .",
    "[ figreg ] .",
    "the diagrams with one internal diffuson is analogous to fig .",
    "[ figreg](c)i , while the ones with two internal diffusons are analogous to figs .",
    "[ figreg](a)i,(b)i .",
    "the equivalents of figs .",
    "[ figreg](a)ii,(b)ii and ( c)ii also occur .",
    "the important difference with the previous diagrams , though , is that at the interference vertices no amplitudes are exchanged . in this respect",
    "they differ qualitatively from hikami - boxes , where partner exchange does occur .",
    "explicit calculation shows that these terms cancel both at zero and non - zero external momentum , this was also already noted by kane , serota and lee@xcite , see their fig .",
    "these classes of diagrams can thus be fully neglected .",
    "this cancellation is due to time reversal invariance .",
    "apart from these two classes , the kadanoff - baym approach , using ( [ deffunc ] ) , generates all presented diagrams as we checked with the computer program .",
    "the generating functional for the extra diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figmbox1 ] is drawn in fig .",
    "[ figr5 ] .    in conclusion , the analysis of this section [ secshort ] shows that when the external momenta vanish , all leading terms cancel at fixed value of the internal momentum . upon integration over",
    "the loop momentum one still has zero and , in particular , not a divergent contribution .",
    "for an infinite system the theory is thus well - behaved at short distances .",
    "the divergence has canceled in a careful study of the short - distance process ; renormalization as known from field theories was not needed .",
    "we have now seen that in infinite systems all divergent terms cancel . in realistic systems , such as a slab ,",
    "the same diagrams describe the relevant physics .",
    "they have to be evaluated with appropriate diffuson propagators .",
    "generally they can be written as the bulk term with additional mirror terms . for a slab",
    "they were given in section [ secdif ] .",
    "knowing that the short distance behavior is regular , we can selfconsistently consider all scattering diagrams in the diffusion approximation .",
    "for the long range diagrams this was done already in section [ secdifdiv ] , where all long range contributions were evaluated .",
    "the discussion of previous section has shown that the only new effect comes from the subtraction of eq .",
    "( [ divcor ] ) . in the diffusion limit for a quasi one - dimensional system at fixed transversal momentum",
    "@xmath135 it results in a contact term , labeled @xmath267 .",
    "@xmath268 this indeed cancels exactly the leading divergency that remained in eq.([fabc ] ) for the sum of @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 . the milder divergency present in the individual terms @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 in two and three dimensions canceled already by summing them .",
    "diagrammatically this can be seen as follows : the diagrams responsible for the latter divergence contain one internal diffuson ( such in fig .",
    "[ figreg](c ) ) . for these diagrams",
    "one does not have the complications of the previous section ; double counting corrections , different resonant momentum configurations , and extra diagrams are absent .",
    "this was confirmed by our computer generated diagrams .",
    "the only contributions which remain in ( [ eqsumf ] ) are thus the double @xmath201integrals .",
    "this finite remainder of our theory yields the sought conductance fluctuations .",

    "the value at vanishing transversal momentum gives the variance of the conductance in one dimensions , integration over the transversal momentum yields the correlation in two and three dimensions .",
    "using the general result of ( [ eqf ] ) and ( [ eqt2 ] ) various cases are considered by inserting the diffusons derived in section [ secdif ] .",
    "first consider the case of fully transmitting surfaces ; if we neglect absorption and frequency differences this gives @xmath273 which decays for large @xmath135 as @xmath274 . in this case",
    "we recover @xmath275 in which @xmath276 is riemann s zeta function .",
    "these are well known results@xcite .",
    "we determine also the frequency dependency of the correlation ; this is important as it determines the frequency range of the light needed to see the fluctuations . taking the frequency dependency into account",
    "we obtain @xmath277 the correlation decays for large frequency differences as @xmath278 , as was stated by lee , stone and fukuyama@xcite .",
    "we were unable to perform the double integral over the position analytically in presence of absorption . in figs .",
    "[ figc3k1d ] , [ figc3k2d ] , and [ figc3k3d ] we show the one , two , and three dimensional correlation functions for various values of the absorption .",
    "it is seen that especially the top of the correlation is reduced due to absorption .",
    "next we applied our theory to the case of partial reflection at the surfaces of the sample .",
    "we assume an index of refraction @xmath279 . for our purpose",
    "the internal reflections are coded in only one parameter , the injection depth @xmath75 , see ( [ totfluxladin ] ) , ( [ totfluxladout ] ) , ( [ lint1 ] ) . for optically thick samples",
    "the correlations are now determined by @xmath280 .",
    "it is physically clear that the internal reflections lead to a less steep diffuse intensity in the sample as function of the depth .",
    "the fluctuations are proportional to the space derivatives and are thus reduced .",
    "the results are presented in the figs .",
    "[ figc3z01d ] , [ figc3z02d ] and [ figc3z03d ] where the correlation functions is plotted for various values of the ratio between extrapolation length and sample thickness .",
    "one sees that already for small ratios of @xmath280 the correlation is significantly lower than without surface internal reflection .",
    "it is seen that neither the variance ( the value at vanishing @xmath281 ) , nor the form of the correlations are universal , they are sensitive to absorption and internal reflections .",
    "the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) of mesoscopic electronic systems have a direct counterpart in other mesoscopic systems with multiply scattered classical waves .",
    "the corresponding average normalized correlation function is the @xmath3 .",
    "it is known that a naive calculation of this object in the landauer approach is plagued with short distance divergencies . in this work",
    "we have presented a detailed diagrammatic approach to the calculation of the @xmath3 correlation function .",
    "we first evaluated the leading long range diagrams . as expected , each diagram , but also their sum , contains a short distance divergency .",
    "also a subleading divergency occurs , but for a slab geometry is was found to cancel automatically .",
    "the study of the cancellation of the leading divergency then was the main theme of the paper .",
    "consistency of the approach requires finding extra contributions that exactly cancel the already determined divergency , and therefore serves as proof that the set of long range diagrams exhaust all of them .",
    "we developed a diagrammatic method that systematically generates all leading scattering diagrams .",
    "this set was checked by computer .",
    "a large number of diagrams had to be considered in detail .",
    "we summed these diagrams for an infinite system at fixed value of the loop momentum .",
    "it was seen that also beyond the diffusion approximation the action of hikami boxes on the long range propagators is to eliminate the long range terms , and leave only some low order contributions",
    ". moreover , some low order terms of diagrams with diffusons have a lower degeneracy than their higher order equivalents . taking this into account led exactly to a cancellation of all terms in an infinite system .",
    "next we discussed that some extra classes of leading diagrams occur , but they all add up to zero .",
    "thus in an infinite system all diagrams cancel , so that , in particular , no short range divergency occurs .",
    "all short range contributions could be coded in a contact term ( [ eqfd ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how it is derived in a non - linear sigma - model formulation of the theory , possibly along the lines of serota , desposito and ma@xcite .",
    "subsequently the theory was applied to systems of finite size . here",
    "the short distance divergencies cancel as well , because the large scale geometry of the system does not have influence on short range effects .",
    "the final result is non - zero as it describes the correlation function in terms of derivatives of external diffusion propagators of the geometry considered ; such terms have no meaning in an infinite system .    our central result for the correlation function of the conductance is given in ( [ eqf ] ) .",
    "it is obtained by adding the result of the long range diagrams ( [ fabc ] ) and the contact term ( [ eqfd ] ) .",
    "when there is no absorption , agreement is found with the result of kane , serota and lee@xcite .",
    "all external diffusons are differentiated once . when absorption is present , however , their approach is no longer valid .",
    "we found that extra terms appear where some external diffusons are differentiated twice or are proportional to @xmath282 , see ( [ eqlkappa ] ) .",
    "we have applied the results to realistic optical systems .",
    "the frequency dependent @xmath3 correlation function was calculated for the case where a diffuse incoming beam is used and all outgoing intensity is collected .",
    "it was seen that both absorption and internal reflections decrease the correlations by a considerable amount .",
    "this is important for a quantitative analysis of experimental data .",
    "electromagnetic measurements that involve the @xmath3 correlation have been reported by genack et al.@xcite .",
    "these authors were able to describe the data of their infrared experiments by adding the @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath3 contributions , but they incorrectly assumed that the @xmath3 is frequency independent .",
    "the experimental investigation of optical universal conductance fluctuations is known to be very difficult .",
    "one problem is that if the incoming beam has to be diffusive , it will have a low intensity .",
    "we propose here a different way to measure the same interference effect .",
    "consider a laser beam coming in in a given direction @xmath6 and measure the frequency dependent total transmission .",
    "such can be done using an integrating sphere@xcite . then repeat the measurement for a very different incoming direction @xmath13 . each of these two signals will exhibit the large @xmath17 correlation function@xcite . however , when the directions @xmath6 and @xmath13 are not close to each other , the @xmath17 will not contribute to the _ cross correlate_. the cross correlation of the total transmission is much smaller than the autocorrelates ; it just represents the typical term of the ucf in ( [ c3-g ] ) . as this cross correlate is of relative order @xmath4",
    ", it is of the same order of magnitude as the third cumulant of the total transmission .",
    "a very precise measurement of that quantity was carried out by de boer , van albada and lagendijk , and reported in collaboration with two of us@xcite .",
    "it may therefore be expected that it is just possible to measure @xmath3 , and thus essentially the ucf , with visible light .",
