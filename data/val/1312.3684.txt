    "it has long been proposed that much of the baryon number ( @xmath4 ) of the universe is condensed into the quark phase ( usually called quark nuggets , qns ) during the quark - hadron phase transition  @xcite . to survive in the hot qcd medium ( @xmath5 150 mev ) ,",
    "a qn of a certain size must outlive two decay processes , namely surface evaporation  @xcite and boiling [ nucleation of hadronic bubbles ( hbs ) ]  @xcite .",
    "the former is generally very efficient when the environment is transparent to neutrinos , and the details mainly depend  @xcite on the dynamic properties of the neutrino - driven cooling , for example the neutrino opacity .",
    "our interest lies in the latter case , i.e. , the boiling of qns into hadrons , which is closely related to the underlying microscopic physics of the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "in one of the earliest studies , alcock & olinto  @xcite described nucleons in terms of an ideal gas , and assumed that the pressure in the strange - quark matter would be contributed entirely by the thermal spectrum of light particles ( electrons , neutrinos , and photons ) .",
    "based on the idea that if the total surface area of hbs exceeds the qn surface area , boiling would be inefficient , they found a baryon number minimum @xmath0 above which boiling is important , and concluded that this limit must be as high as @xmath6 - @xmath7 .",
    "they have furthermore treated the surface tension of qns , @xmath8 , as a free parameter and obtained for it an unusually large lower limit , namely ( 178 mev)@xmath9 , which would mean that almost all qns could not survive boiling .",
    "later madsen & olesen  @xcite treated the hadron phase as a walecka - type interacting neutron - proton - electron ( @xmath10 ) gas and also introduced the fermion pressure in the quark phase using the mit bag - like model  @xcite .",
    "they found a rapid dependence of @xmath0 on the parameters ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 is the bag constant .",
    "they argued that qns may survive boiling for some choice of ( @xmath11 ) , and that therefore for such a case boiling is not the dominant decay process for qns , compared to the evaporation mentioned above .",
    "in the recent work of lugones & horvath  @xcite , quark pairing and the curvature energy were introduced in the quark phase and it was concluded that both boiling and surface evaporation would be suppressed by the pairing gap .",
    "the authors also argued that boiling might be unlikely for intermediate temperatures ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 is the pairing gap .",
    "clearly , the most important aspect for the boiling problem is how to treat the strong interaction between quarks ( in the quark phase ) and between hadrons ( in the hadron phase ) .",
    "this will evidently affect the chemical composition of the two phases , and lead to different conclusions of the occurrence of boiling .",
    "the aim of this work is hence to employ the hadronic and quark eoss based on the most advanced microscopic approaches .",
    "the results should have important impacts on the conclusions reached before  @xcite based on the phenomenological nuclear many - body theory .",
    "we can also get more insight from the comparison of the calculated results using different versions of baryon interactions , that is , to achieve a better understanding on the relation between the cosmological qcd phase transition and the underlying eos .    for the quark phase ,",
    "the simple mit bag model  @xcite used in previous studies  @xcite is actually not well justified , since it includes no interactions between quarks ( quarks are asymptotically free within a large bag ) .",
    "also , the model itself was originally proposed in order to treat quark confinement , therefore at any finite temperature , a more self - consistent scheme to treat thermal radiation and particle - antiparticle creation is needed . in the present study this is achieved by a fully self - consistent thermodynamic treatment of confinement , i.e. , a recently developed quark mass density - dependent ( qmdd ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model has been widely used in the last few years for the structures and the viscosity of compact stars  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , thanks to the rapid progress in the treatment of microscopic theories of the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) in recent years , a detailed study of the hadron phase is by now possible , and we in the present work therefore can treat it much more accurately than in the phenomenological relativistic mean - field model used before  @xcite .",
    "we employ the parameter - free microscopic brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach that has been widely used for the study of dense stellar matter and neutron star properties  @xcite , along with two cases of baryon interactions as inputs .",
    "they have the same nucleonic two - body potentials , argonne v18  @xcite , but different three - body forces ( tbf ) , i.e. , the phenomenological urbana model  @xcite , and a microscopic tbf constructed from the meson - exchange current approach  @xcite .",
    "both of them reproduce fairly well the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter around the saturation density of @xmath15 @xmath16 , and also fulfill the recent 2-solar - mass neutron star mass measurement  @xcite .",
    "they , however , give a very different high - density eos ( @xmath17 @xmath16 )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the microscopic tbf turns out to be more repulsive than the urbana model at high densities , and the discrepancy between the two predictions becomes increasingly large as the density increases .",
    "since the threshold of the quark - hadron transition is essentially determined by the stiffness of different hadron eoss , we should keep in mind that the eos from the microscopic tbf is stiffer than that of the phenomenological one .",
    "hereafter , we refer to `` stiff eos '' as the one with the microscopic tbf , and to `` soft eos '' as the one with the phenomenological tbf .",
    "calculations are mainly done using the microscopic tbf , and results with the phenomenological tbf are presented as well in several cases for comparison .",
    "here we have neglected the possible appearance of hyperons and pion or kaon condensates in the hadron phase , which in general might soften the high - density eos .",
    "how to confront them with the high - mass neutron stars is an important topic discussed frequently in recent papers  @xcite",
    ". it would be straightforward to include the strangeness in the hadron phase in a subsequent study , once the controversial high - density eos is clarified .",
    "let us also mention here that the subject of study of the boiling of qns ( into hadrons ) , in principle demands that the qcd phase transition is of first order ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "lattice qcd studies over the past years have however reached the conclusion that , for physical quark masses and a vanishing baryon chemical potential @xmath18 , this transition is rather a smooth crossover than a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "if the universe follows the  standard \" scenario and undergoes the qcd phase transition with only a very small @xmath18 , this would mean that qns could not have been created and the discussion of their properties would thus be irrelevant for the universe that we live in .",
    "it should however be stressed here that there is room for an alternative scenario , which has been discussed in the literature  @xcite as little inflation . in this case , the universe follows a path with larger @xmath18 and can therefore undergo a first order phase transition as the qcd phase diagram is expected to have a critical endpoint at some finite value of @xmath18 , above which the the quark - gluon plasma and hadron gas phases are separated by a first order phase transition line .",
    "the creation of qns can hence not be ruled out and studying their properties may still be of relevance for the physics of our universe .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we establish our physical model and describe in details the numerical methods for the calculation . in section 3 , numerical results are discussed .",
    "we present our main conclusions in section 4 .",
    "in the hot qcd medium , the hadron gas may be energetically favored in thermal fluctuations , and bubbles of hadronic gas would nucleate throughout the volume of the produced nuggets of strange matter .",
    "this process is called `` boiling of qns '' .",
    "if boiling happens , the qn would dissolute into hadrons and disappear in the universe .    following the estimation using classical nucleation theory by alcock & olinto  @xcite ,",
    "the work done to form a bubble of radius @xmath19 composed by the hadronic phase inside the quark phase is @xmath20 where @xmath8 is the qn surface tension .",
    "we follow madsen & olesen  @xcite and self - consistently calculate the surface tension from all fermion species ( @xmath21 ) as : @xmath22kdk.\\ ] ] where the energy @xmath23 is given as @xmath24 with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) being the mass ( chemical potential ) of component @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the temperature .",
    "@xmath29 is the pressure difference between the hadron phase ( with a pressure of @xmath30 ) and the quark phase ( with a pressure of @xmath31 ) . assuming that the phase transition is first order , its properties are calculated from the the pressure difference between the two phases based on the chemical equilibrium condition : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the baryon chemical potentials for the hadron and quark phases , respectively .    specifically , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , besides the common pressures from thermal photons and neutrinos , @xmath30 is contributed by hadrons and @xmath35 pairs which will be dealt as accurately as possible here , @xmath31 constitutes a nonthermal pressure from @xmath36 quarks and @xmath35 pairs . since the pressure of the quark phase , @xmath31 , is equal to the pressure in the universe ( mainly contributed by thermal photons , neutrinos , electrons , and positrons ) , the nonthermal contributions of quarks and @xmath35 pairs in the quark phase balance exactly the thermal electrons and positrons in the universe .",
    "this constrain is used to determine the independent baryon chemical potential , @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , @xmath37 comes from the pressure difference apart from the common contribution from thermal photons and neutrinos , and can be computed from the pressure of hadron phase , @xmath30 , subtracted by the pressure from thermally produced electrons and positrons : @xmath38 with @xmath39 the fermi ",

    "that gives a minimum baryon number @xmath0 above which boiling is efficient  @xcite : @xmath48 much of the microscopic physics introduced in the present work , including the quark - quark interaction , would enter in @xmath37 and consequently influence the physics of boiling .",

    "also , the larger the confining parameter , the larger the surface tension , which is reasonable because quarks interact more strongly .",
    "the baryon chemical potentials are decreasing functions with the temperature . with the increase of the confining parameter @xmath1 , the equilibrium chemical potential @xmath18 of the two phases increases due to a larger pressure difference @xmath37 as shown in fig .",

    "compared with that of the hadron eos , the effect of the quark confining parameter @xmath1 is more evident",
    ". a larger @xmath1 value will result in increasing baryon densities both in qns and hbs , and also lead to a larger density gap between the two phases , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "one can also notice a small decreasing effect of the soft hadron eos on the density gap .    for a smaller density gap between the two phases , the boiling of a qn to hbs becomes more difficult , as it is clearly demonstrated in fig .",

    "a small change of the @xmath1 value from 170 mev would result in a sensitively sharp increase of the @xmath0 value , which is far from the baryon number of a cosmological qn .",
    "this is what happens in the cases of 158 mev and 225 mev .",
    "it means that only for a small parameter range of the confining parameter @xmath1 , there is a chance that the qn boiling could happen very efficiently during the early stage ( @xmath124 90 mev ) of the cooling . otherwise , the baryon limit is irrelevant and no qns could boil and might survive until the present time .",
    "we mention here that our calculation demonstrates an amazing coincidence of the lattice results  @xcite just falling into the range where boiling could be important .",
    "in this paper , we have renewed the study of the boiling of possible qns during the quark - hadron phase transition of the universe at nonzero chemical potential . for this purpose ,",
    "a parameter - free microscopic bhf model extended to finite temperature is employed for the hadron phase to describe hbs , and a quark model with self - consistent thermodynamic treatment of the confinement is used to deal with the quark phase for the description of qns .",
    "both phases are in beta - stable equilibrium through weak processes .",
    "the phase transition is regarded as a first - order one , in order to get the pressure difference between the two phases . also , the important parameter of the qn surface tension is calculated self - consistently at each sets of parameters .",
    "detailed presentations of the qn surface tension , the baryon chemical potential , as well as the pressures and the baryon densities for the two phases are shown .",
    "we found a larger effect of the confinement parameter , than that of the hadron eos .",
    "the baryon number limits are found above which boiling could be efficient .",
    "it turns out that only a limited range of the confinement parameter allow boiling to happen around a temperature of 90 mev .",
    "this allowed range of the confinement parameter falls comfortably into the range provided by lattice qcd .",
    "this therefore appears to be the favoured scenario at present .",
    "large numbers of qns would boil to hns in this case and qns may not exist in the present universe . for other values of this parameter , boiling is impossible to happen , and qns with a cosmological baryon number of @xmath3 could be possibly found .",
    "future experiments of detecting dark matter can provide a crucial cross - check to this problem .",
    "furthermore , the importance of quark pairing gap was demonstrated in the work of lugones & horvath  @xcite within the mit model , taking into account the bcs - type of pairing for quarks .",
    "therefore , a more proper treatment of pairing , for example using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) , or the polyakov - njl model ( pnjl ) , should be interesting .",
    "since the njl ( or pnjl ) model , not like the mit + bcs scheme , incorporates all the symmetries known from the fundamental theory of strong interactions ( i.e. , quantum chromodynamics ) , it could improve our understanding of the boiling problem and its relation with the phase diagram of the high - density strong interaction matter .",

    "<S> the boiling of possible quark nuggets during the quark - hadron phase transition of the universe at nonzero chemical potential is revisited within the microscopic brueckner - hartree - fock approach employed for the hadron phase , using two kinds of baryon interactions as fundamental inputs . to describe the deconfined phase of quark matter </S>",
    "<S> , we use a recently developed quark mass density - dependent model with a fully self - consistent thermodynamic treatment of confinement . </S>",
    "<S> we study the baryon number limit @xmath0 ( above which boiling may be important ) with three typical values for the confinement parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is firstly found that the baryon interaction with a softer equation of state for the hadron phase would only lead to a small increase of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , results depend sensitively on the confinement parameter in the quark model . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , boiling might be important during the universe cooling for a limited parameter range around @xmath2 mev , a value satisfying recent lattice qcd calculations of the vacuum chiral condensate , while for other choices of this parameter , boiling might not happen and cosmological quark nuggets of @xmath3 could survive .    </S>",
