    "the fringes are centred near the null ray parallel to @xmath2 running from the lower left to upper right corners of the figures , and in fact point along spacelike directions which become more parallel to @xmath2 as @xmath107 is decreased ( moving from the left - hand to right - hand figure in each row ) . that these directions can not be timelike follows from the existence of the timelike worldline qneis discussed in sec .",

    "we have seen that the massless scalar field in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime does not satisfy nontrivial null worldline quantum inequalities . as described above , this",
    "was shown by considering a sequence of vacuum - plus - two - particle states in which the three - momenta of excited modes become more and more parallel to the spatial part @xmath68 of the null vector @xmath2 as we take the momentum cut - off to infinity .",
    "a perhaps puzzling feature of our sequence is that it converges in fock space to the vacuum vector .",
    "how , then , can the energy density diverge ?",
    "the answer to this question resides in the fact that the averaged energy density is an unbounded quadratic form , so the convergence of a sequence of states in the hilbert space norm does not imply the convergence of the corresponding expectation values . as a more familiar example , consider the quantum mechanics of a single harmonic oscillator with angular frequency @xmath4 .",

    "an interesting feature of our example is that the sampled energy density along the null geodesic becomes unbounded from below while the sequence of quantum states converges to the vacuum state .",
    "we demonstrated how such behavior is possible by considering an analogous example involving the simple harmonic oscillator in ordinary quantum mechanics .",

    "our results imply that it is not possible to prove a singularity theorem , such as penrose s theorem @xcite , by using a null worldline qnei instead of , say , the nec or the anec .",
    "although our results have been proven only for flat spacetime , we have no reason to believe that a null worldline qnei is any more likely to exist in curved spacetime .",
    "singularity theorems such as penrose s theorem involve the focussing of null geodesics which generate the boundary of the future of a closed trapped surface . the latter initiates convergence of a bundle of null rays , and then some bound on the stress - tensor , such as the nec , is required to maintain the focussing .",
    "various sufficient conditions for focussing have been suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that _ no _ bound on the stress energy tensor which is strong enough to ensure sufficient focussing to guarantee the existence of conjugate points on half - complete null geodesics ( as required in the penrose theorem ) could hold everywhere in an evaporating black hole spacetime .",

    "it is somewhat difficult to see how one would prove that such a trapped surface would always exist . as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , in regions of evaporating black hole spacetimes where the anec is violated , it may be possible to get a ( more limited ) qi - type bound that measures the degree of anec violation and which is also invariant under rescaling of the affine parameter . alternatively , one might argue that on dimensional grounds , the curvature which promotes focussing scales as @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the local proper radius of curvature , while the energy densities produced by quantum fields typically scale only like @xmath255 .",
    "if this line of reasoning is correct , then one might expect the breakdown of the energy conditions to only affect the validity of the singularity theorems when @xmath256 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we also showed that  in general globally hyperbolic spacetimes  averages of null - contracted stress - energy of massive and massless fields along _ timelike _ curves are constrained by quantum inequalities .",
    "large negative energy densities concentrated along a null geodesic must therefore be compensated by large positive energy densities on neighbouring null geodesics .",
    "this is reminiscent of the transverse smearing employed by flanagan and wald @xcite in their study of the anec in semiclassical quantum gravity .",
    "such transversely smeared observables also evade the buchholz ",
