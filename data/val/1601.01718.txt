    "the oh ( hydroxyl ) rotational transitions at nearly 18 cm were the first interstellar molecular lines detected in the radio range @xcite .",
    "the ground level of that molecule is split into two sub - levels known as @xmath0-doublets with @xmath1 energies .",
    "each component of the @xmath0-doublets is also split into two hyperfine levels labelled @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as shown in figure [ fig : oh - level diagram ] .",
    "the transitions that connect sub - levels with the same @xmath4-values are called the _ main lines _ , whereas the transitions between sub - levels of different @xmath4-value are called the _ satellite lines _ @xcite . the four transitions including the two main lines at 1665 mhz and 1667 mhz and the two satellite lines at 1612 mhz and 1720 mhz compose the group of 18 cm wavelength lines .",
    "in optically thin regions under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , the expected intensity ratios are approximately 1:5:9:1 for the 1612 mhz , 1665 mhz , 1667 mhz and 1720 mhz lines , respectively @xcite . however , in several observations different line ratios were measured @xcite , and in some cases the intensity of a given line significantly exceeded that predicted using lte @xcite .",
    "the strong anomalous line intensities were explained by postulating maser action for the corresponding transitions .",
    "maser action occurs when lte conditions are violated and velocity coherence is achieved between a group of population - inverted molecules . in the presence of a pumping mechanism that can maintain a higher population in the excited level , the corresponding transition can exhibit the exceptionally high intensity typical of maser sources @xcite",
    ". the aforementioned study of @xcite reported the first detection of an oh maser , which was to be followed by several other detections in different regions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "a few years later @xcite suggested classifying oh maser sources into two classes : type i and type ii , depending on their brightest detected line . in type",
    "i , the main - line transitions , especially the one at 1665 mhz , are dominant . the sources in this class are usually detected in star - forming sites near hii regions .",
    "type ii sources are further divided into type iia and type iib in which the brightest line corresponds to one of the satellite lines .",
    "type iia oh maser sources , which are usually detected in supernova remnants , are brightest at 1720 mhz , while in type iib the 1612 mhz line is dominant .",
    "these sources are often spatially associated with highly evolved stars undergoing rapid mass loss and enclosed in a circumstellar shell @xcite .",
    "in addition , the first extragalactic oh maser was detected in 1982 by @xcite in arp 220 ( ic 4553 ) with a luminosity approximately @xmath5 times greater than that of typical galactic oh masers .",
    "this led to the term `` megamaser . ''",
    "since then several oh megamasers , and even gigamasers , have been detected @xcite , usually in the nuclear region of luminous or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "the existence of 18-cm oh masers confirms the possibility of inverting populations in the ground level @xmath0-doublets of this molecule in the ism .",
    "different pumping mechanisms are suggested for different types of galactic and extragalactic masers .",
    "for instance , type iib maser sources near evolved stars are known to be pumped by the far - infrared radiation emitted from dust ( @xcite ; see section [ sec : requirements - of - superradiance ] for more details ) , while it is suggested that the pumping of oh type i main - line masers is controlled by collisions with @xmath6 molecules in star - forming regions@xcite .",
    "maser action also requires line - of - sight velocity coherence , which can lead to an abnormally narrow line - width through amplification along the radiation path . for galactic oh 18-cm lines",
    "the typical line width is @xmath7 km / s @xcite .",
    "population inversion and velocity coherence are also required for the superradiance cooperative radiation process . in 1954",
    ", r. h. dicke pointed out that a sample consisting of @xmath8 excited atoms / molecules interacting with a common radiation field can not always be considered as a collection of independent radiators @xcite .",
    "he showed that , under ideal conditions and after a time delay , the sample of atoms / molecules can radiate its stored energy at an enhanced rate @xmath9 ; @xmath8 times faster than the spontaneous emission rate @xmath10 of a single atom / molecule . as a result ,",
    "the intensity of the output radiation @xmath11 scales as the square of the number of inverted atoms / molecules @xmath8 , unlike the linear dependency of the radiation intensity from the corresponding non - coherent system @xmath12 ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) .    in the ism , it is usually assumed that atoms / molecules interact with the radiation field independently and the intensity of the radiation becomes a linear function of the atomic / molecular density ( if the line is optically thin ) .",
    "but in the case of oh 18-cm line , for which the detection of several maser sources verifies the possibility of achieving population inversion and velocity coherence in some regions , this assumption may fail and it becomes important to examine the possibility of superradiance and coherent interactions .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we follow on the superradiance analysis performed in paper i for the hi 21 cm ( magnetic dipole ) transition with a similar study for the oh 18 cm ( electric dipole ) line . in order to do so , we first discuss the necessary conditions for superradiance in section [ sec : requirements - of - superradiance ] , and narrow down our focus to the 1612 mhz line interacting with oh molecules in the outer regions of the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of highly evolved stars . in section",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we investigate the likelihood that these conditions can be met in these regions using the heisenberg approach , with a method of analysis that is an electric dipolar version of the magnetic dipole study found in paper i and is similar to earlier analyses found in the physics literature @xcite . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss our numerical results on the characteristics of a potential oh 1612 mhz coherent system , with an application to previous observations performed on the u orionis mira star @xcite and the iras18276 - 1431 pre - planetary nebula @xcite .",
    "we end with a short conclusion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we provide a brief summary of the requirements needed for superradiance , but a more detailed discussion will be found in section 2 of paper i. our discussion applies equally well to atoms or molecules , however , we will focus on molecular superradiance since oh is the subject of our analysis .    when a group of @xmath8 excited molecules are placed within a volume @xmath13 much smaller than @xmath14 , the cube of the wavelength of the radiation @xmath15 interacting with the molecules , the radiation by one molecule is seen to be in phase by the other molecules . as a result",
    ", the radiation from the different molecules interferes constructively and a strong directional pulse emerges from the sample @xcite .",
    "this process can also be described from the molecular point of view . in a small - sample ( i.e. , defined for @xmath16 )",
    "the intermolecular distance @xmath17 is much smaller than @xmath15 and , for such small intermolecular distances , the interaction between the molecular dipoles and the radiation field is symmetrical throughout the sample . as a result ,",
    "after a delay time @xmath18 the molecular dipoles lock to a common phase and act like a single macroscopic dipole radiating a superradiant intensity @xmath19 , where @xmath12 is the intensity of a fully non - coherent system @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon can be extended to a large - sample , defined as @xmath8 molecules distributed over a volume @xmath20 , with inter - molecular spacings potentially larger than @xmath15 . in a large - sample ,",
    "the phase of the radiation varies from place to place as a result of propagation .",
    "this will lead to a non - uniform spatial evolution of the molecules , and can result in a weaker coherent behavior as compared to that of a small - sample .",
    "however , the higher number of molecules partaking in coherent interactions in a large - sample can make up for this , resulting in an intense output superradiant pulse with @xmath21 , where the @xmath22 factor determines the enhancement of the radiation intensity in comparison to @xmath12 and the efficiency of the common phase - locking process is reflected in @xmath23 alone . unlike for a small - sample , the phase - matching condition in a large - sample can only be met in some particular directions , and the fact that the phase - locking factor @xmath24 is always smaller than unity implies a weakened superradiance .",
    "it is found that after a delay time @xmath25 , a first burst of superradiance emerges the sample followed by a number of weaker bursts , the so - called ringing effect ( see section [ sec : theory ] below , and sections 3 and 4 in paper i ) .",
    "the ringing effect is associated with the re - absorption and re - emission of radiation through the end - fire ( i.e. , the observer - facing cross - section of the superradiant sample ) of a large - sample interacting with the incoming radiation originating from other parts farther away in the sample .",
    "any mechanism that non - coherently reduces the excited level population ( e.g. , collisional relaxation ) or disturbs the phase - locking process can diminish and even terminate superradiance .",
    "it is therefore necessary that the time - scale of dephasing / relaxation effects be longer than @xmath25 in a large - sample ( or @xmath18 in a small - sample ) to allow for the development of any coherent behavior .",
    "this also explains why velocity coherence is an essential condition for superradiance . in the absence of velocity coherence , random thermal motions in a gas results in doppler line broadening that corresponds to a very short dephasing time - scale ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) , and renders this phenomenon the most likely cause of dephasing in a sample .",
    "for this reason , it is not expected that superradiance could arise in a thermally relaxed gas .",
    "our study of superradiance is better suited to regions of the ism where thermal equilibrium has not been reached ( e.g. , shocks ; see paper i ) .",
    "however , this does not imply that doppler broadening is not present in a velocity - coherent region , but it is expected to be less constraining than in a thermally relaxed environment .    for any region in the ism , inelastic collisions with ions , electrons , hydrogen atoms and molecules , or dust grains can further change the internal state of an oh molecule , and if the associated time - scale is smaller than @xmath25 , coherent behavior and superradiance can be suppressed . although they do not change the internal state of a molecule , elastic collisions",
    "can also interrupt the coherent phase - locking process and weaken superradiance .",
    "this is because during an elastic collision the spacings between energy levels for the colliding counterparts change as a result of short - range interaction forces . after a number of such collisions each acting like a random perturbation",
    ", the molecule can lose coherence with the interacting radiation field @xcite .",
    "elastic collisions are normally more frequent than inelastic collisions , and the mean time between elastic collisions usually sets the time - scale of collisional dephasing / relaxation @xmath27 and the corresponding condition @xmath28 is required to allow the build - up of coherent interactions .",
    "the above discussion also implies that coherent interactions can not be developed in a collisionally pumped oh sample since that would require that the pumping time - scale @xmath29 , which contradicts the necessary condition @xmath30 for superradiance ( see paper i ) .",
    "thus , for our present study of superradiance we will only focus on oh samples that are believed to be inverted through radiative processes .",
    "the studies of pumping mechanism of oh masers show that the 1612 mhz masers associated with evolved stars are pumped by far - infrared photons at 35 and 53 @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these photons are emitted from dust shells formed by mass losses * * from the central star . the radiative pumping model for 1612 mhz masers near evolved stars is corroborated by the observation of correlated variations in the intensities of the star and corresponding masers @xcite . while recent studies by @xcite and @xcite suggest that oh megamasers , which emit primarily at 1667 mhz and 1665 mhz , are also pumped by far - infrared radiation ( more precisely 53 @xmath31 radiation from dust ) , the determination of the exact pumping mechanism of main - line masers still requires more studies and collisional processes are not generally ruled out from the pumping scenarios @xcite .",
    "hence , in this paper we limit our investigation to the possibility of superradiance for the 1612 mhz line interacting with oh molecules in the circumstellar envelopes of late - type stars .",
    "one of the final stages in the evolution of a low- to intermediate - mass star ( i.e. , stars with masses of about @xmath32 m@xmath33 to @xmath34 m@xmath33 ) is the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase . in that stage ,",
    "the star , which is composed of an oxygen / carbon core enclosed within layers of hydrogen and helium , becomes variable and can produce shock waves .",
    "shock waves initiate the mass - loss process from the photosphere of the star to cooler regions where the gas particles can clump into dust grains , which interact with the radiation from the star over a broad continuum . through these interactions",
    "the radially outgoing photons transfer their momentum to dust grains driving them outward .",
    "this also results in an outflow of the gas particles that are coupled to dust grains through collisions @xcite .",
    "as outflowing waves move further from the star , they become cooler and denser and form the cse .",
    "the cse of an evolved star can harbor masers of different types depending on its composition .",
    "oh masers are usually found in the cse of oxygen - rich ( or m - type ) stars .",
    "examples of such stars are mira variables , long - period m - type stars with periods of 100 - 500 days @xcite , which are known source of 1612 mhz oh maser emission .",
    "oh - ir stars are another group of long - period variables ( lpv ) that were originally detected through their 1612 mhz oh maser emission and the infrared radiation emanating from their cse .",
    "miras are variable at both visible and infrared wavelengths , whereas the cse of oh - ir stars absorbs starlight at visible wavelengths and re - emits it in the infrared .",
    "oh - ir stars are thought to lose mass at a rate of @xmath35 m@xmath36 yr@xmath37 to @xmath38 m@xmath36 yr@xmath37 forming larger cses than miras , which have a lower mass - loss rate .",
    "the cses of these evolved stars are theoretically divided into three zones @xcite , of which the inner and outer zones are relevant to our study . in the outermost zone , where the cse is optically thin , uv light from the interstellar medium dissociates @xmath39 molecules into oh . in the inner zones ,",
    "the radiation from the central star is absorbed by dust grains and is re - emitted in the infrared .",
    "it was initially suggested by @xcite that the 35- and 53-@xmath40 infrared photons emitted from dust pump the 1612 mhz oh masers in the outer regions of the cse of evolved stars .",
    "the pumping scheme proposed by @xcite was modified by @xcite , and their detailed analysis of collisional and radiative couplings of oh molecules in the expanding cse of oh - ir stars indicated that the strongest pumping route uses 53-@xmath40 photons .",
    "the cse of evolved stars expands radially and reaches a constant terminal velocity @xmath41 km @xmath42 to @xmath43 km @xmath42 in its outer regions @xcite .",
    "at distances about @xmath44 cm from the central star , velocity coherence is achieved among oh molecules moving with the well - defined terminal velocity in the radial or tangential directions relative to the oh shell @xcite .",
    "this velocity coherence can be maintained over the so - called sobolev length , which is typically on the order of @xmath45 cm for lpv evolved stars ( see section [ subsec : u - orionis ] below ) .",
    "this , therefore , may allow the existence of relatively long oh samples , if inversion is achieved through infrared pumping from warm dust .",
    "in such samples coherent correlations may develop if the shortest non - coherent relaxation / dephasing time - scale is larger than @xmath25 .",
    "although our analysis is better adapted to regions where thermal equilibrium has not been reached , we will approximate the time - scale of relaxation / dephasing effects in the usual manner applicable to a thermally relaxed gas .",
    "we should , however , keep in mind that the time - scales calculated that way are likely to provide overestimates and should be considered as worst case scenarios , as far as superradiance is concerned .",
    "one of the main relaxation / dephasing mechanisms in the cse of evolved stars is collision . we will * * therefore determine collision time - scales in oh samples given a temperature @xmath46 and number density @xmath47 of hydrogen molecules , which are expected to be the main collisional partners of oh in molecular gas shells @xcite .",
    "these parameters depend on the mass - loss rate of the central star in a circumstellar envelope @xcite.for instance , at a mass - loss rate of @xmath48 the abundance of oh molecules is estimated to be approximately @xmath49 @xmath50 , while @xmath51 @xmath50 at @xmath52 cm based on the study of different physical and chemical processes taking place in the cses of oh - ir stars @xcite . allowing for potentially lower mass - loss rates , we will consider the 10@xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath50 range in what follows .    the time - scale of oh@xmath55 collisions can be determined with the knowledge of the collisional cross sections in these regions .",
    "the cross sections for inelastic oh@xmath55 collisions at different temperatures are given in @xcite , and the related time - scale is estimated to range from @xmath56 sec to @xmath57 sec for 10@xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath50 , respectively . for elastic oh@xmath55 collisions",
    "the corresponding time - scale is given by    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the geometrical cross - sectional area of a hydrogen molecule and @xmath62 is the mean relative velocity of oh molecules @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath62 is estimated to be @xmath63 km s@xmath37 at @xmath64 k. inserting these values into equation ( [ eq : mean - time - collision ] ) gives @xmath65 sec @xmath66 sec for 10@xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "as was already mentioned , elastic oh@xmath55 collisions are found to be somewhat more frequent than their inelastic counterpart and thus set the time - scale of collisional dephasing @xmath27 .    another important process that affects the population of oh energy levels in the cse of evolved stars is the infrared radiative coupling of rotational levels . as was mentioned earlier , the warm dust in the cse absorbs the radiation from the central star and re - emits it at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the different infrared couplings of the oh rotational levels have large transition dipoles leading to fast excitation / relaxation rates .",
    "it should be noted that these transition rates also depend on the opacity at the corresponding infrared wavelengths , which vary over the different zones of the cse . among the different infrared coupling routes some pump the 1612-mhz line",
    "while others deplete the population inversion and have a relaxation effect .",
    "the numerical studies conducted by @xcite show that these infrared couplings are responsible for the inverted oh zones , with a relaxation time - scale for the 1612-mhz line , including collisional and radiative couplings , on the order of @xmath67 sec for a mass loss rate of @xmath68 m@xmath36 yr@xmath37 . allowing for variations with different mass loss rates ,",
    "we find that the radiative relaxation time - scales are comparable to those expected from collisions in these regions . for the sake of our discussion we will assume , for simplicity , that the time - scale of oh@xmath55 collisions sets the upper limit for the characteristic time - scales of superradiance in circumstellar oh samples , but we keep in mind that infrared radiative coupling may also be responsible for this . for the aforementioned range of @xmath6 densities , when assuming thermal equilibrium the delay time @xmath25 and the characteristic time of superradiance @xmath69 should not exceed @xmath65 sec to @xmath70 sec . although these figures should be viewed as worst case scenarios ( i.e. , lower limits ) , they allow us to get a sense of the time - scales involved .",
    "as we will see later , these time - scales imply intensity variations that could last as long as several years .",
    "in this section we use the formalism developed in @xcite to describe the behavior of a superradiant system . since , as will be seen in section [ sec : discussion ] , the realization of superradiance small - sample is unlikely to take place in the cses of evolved stars for the collisional time - scales previously calculated ( see paper i ) , we focus our analysis on the case of a large - sample .    taking into account the dephasing / relaxation effects ,",
    "the behavior of a superradiant system can be expressed by a set of so - called maxwell - bloch equations within the framework of the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea )    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the ( phenomenological ) time - scale of non - coherent population relaxation ( e.g. , through inelastic collisions ) and similarly @xmath73 for phase relaxation ( e.g. , through elastic collisions ) .",
    "these equations were derived within the context of the heisenberg representation .",
    "the quantities @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the envelopes for the polarization @xmath76 and the electric field @xmath77 vectors , respectively , which are assumed to have the following form    @xmath78    with @xmath79 the unit vector indicating the orientation of the molecular electric dipole moment",

    "an oh sample interacting with the radiation along the line - of - sight can be modeled by a cylindrical large - sample along the @xmath86-axis . although a one - dimensional field equation discards the loss of radiation due to diffraction or transverse effects , it is an approximation that reduces the number of variables and allows us to move the analysis forward while retaining the essential physics of the problem .",

    "hence , in higher mass - loss rates the envelope becomes more opaque to pump photons and the extent of the region accessible to pump decreases .",
    "it is expected that population - inverted regions typically rangefrom @xmath147 cm to @xmath148 cm****in thickness @xcite .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : tr - large - sample ] ) we can use this range for the length @xmath89 of a cylindrical large - sample , along with our previous values of @xmath149 @xmath50 ( i.e. , 643 molecules within @xmath14 ) and @xmath150 sec to find @xmath151 * * * * using a fresnel number of unity to minimize diffraction losses in our calculations , specifying a radius @xmath112 ranging from @xmath152 cm to @xmath153 cm , we find that @xmath154 for the same range of cylindrical lengths .",
    "the time - scales are evidently very short in comparison to our previous estimates of @xmath155 .",
    "it thus appears reasonable to expect that superradiance could take place in the cses of such evolved stars .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath156 sec for as small a value as @xmath157 cm . given these numbers ,",
    "we now investigate potential observational evidence for superradiance in the oh 1612 mhz line .",
    "u orionis is a m8 iii - type oh mira variable with a period of 372 days , which has exhibited in the past significant variations in the intensity of several oh maser emission lines .",
    "@xcite reported the results of their monitoring program of the 1612 mhz , 1665 mhz , and 1667 mhz masers observed in the cse of u ori , along with a compilation of similar data taken from several other sources @xcite covering several years of observations ( i.e. , from 1974 to 1979 ) .",
    "all three maser lines exhibited significant flaring events during that period .",
    "although the 1665 mhz and 1667 mhz masers showed strong correlation in their intensity variations , the 1612 mhz maser displayed a completely different behavior characterized by the authors as a `` damped oscillator decline '' spanning about an order of magnitude in intensity range over the period .",
    "these variations were also clearly uncorrelated with the star s light curve ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) , and there has been no satisfactory explanation for such behavior that we are aware of so far .",
    "since the ringing in superradiance intensity displayed in the @xmath125 and @xmath108 curves shown in figure [ fig : equaldeaphsing - largesample ] is also reminiscent of a `` damped oscillator '' behavior , the data of @xcite provide us with a first opportunity to test our oh 1612 mhz superradiance model .",
    "we accordingly show in figure [ fig : jewell ] the results of our attempt . in the figure ,",
    "the black dots are taken from figure 1 of @xcite , while the ( blue ) solid curve is calculated from our model discussed in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "we have once again used the internal fluctuation condition to trigger superradiance ( i.e , @xmath120 ) , which resulted in @xmath158 rad ( @xmath123 ; see equation [ [ eq : delay - time - large - sample ] ] ) for the chosen parameters @xmath159 days and @xmath160 , while keeping @xmath161 @xmath50 .",
    "given the simplicity of our one - dimensional superradiance model we have not attempted to perform any formal fit to the data , but merely adjusted the model s free parameters ( i.e. , @xmath69 and @xmath124 ) to reproduce the main features found in the data .",
    "our model was also `` normalized '' in intensity to that of the data .",
    "unfortunately , the data is sparse early on ( i.e. , up to approximately day 2600 ) and we can not be certain of the proper behavior during that period , but the intensity is well constrained for the rest of the observation period .",
    "we should also note that the data compiled in @xcite , realized with different facilities and instruments probing sometimes different polarization states , do not focus on a single spectral feature but rather represent the integrated flux over a finite bandwidth . despite these facts and the simplicity of our model ,",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the intensity is relatively well captured by the superradiance model .",
    "more precisely , the intensity of the last four maxima ( at times beyond day 2500 ) are reasonably well matched by the curve , both in their relative intensities and times of occurrence .",
    "we note that the superradiant system stemming from our calculations yields a cylindrical length @xmath162 cm , which is orders of magnitude shorter than corresponding scales expected for * * masers .",
    "it follows that , within the context of our model , a large number of superradiant large - samples must be responsible for creating a radiation intensity strong enough to be detected during the flaring period ( see section [ subsec : transition - between - maser ] below ) .",
    "also , the dephasing time @xmath124 needed to reproduce the data corresponds to approximately 7 years ( @xmath163 sec and @xmath164 ) and points to conditions significantly less constraining than those previously calculated for a thermally relaxed gas , as expected .",
    "this implies the existence of significant velocity coherence over the length @xmath89 of a superradiant sample",
    ". this may not be surprising considering the sobolev length for this source , which we evaluate to be @xmath165 cm using previously published data on the velocity gradient found in u ori s cse @xcite .",
    "the relative smallness of a superradiant sample ( i. e. , @xmath166 ) is an indicator of small frequency shifts and longer dephasing time - scales in the superradiant samples .",
    "iras18276 - 1431 ( oh17.7 - 2.0 ) is a pre - planetary nebula with a detached cse and central star of spectral type earlier than k5 , long known for its strong 1612 mhz oh maser emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently published the results of a monitoring campaign performed between 2002 and 2009 , where emission from oh masers at 1612 mhz , 1665 mhz , and 1667 mhz was measured twice monthly using the nanay radio telescope . while a monotonic decay and rise in intensity",
    "were detected at 1665 mhz and 1667 mhz , respectively , the integrated flux from the red - shifted part of the 1612 mhz spectrum revealed a significant intensity flare lasting approximately 6 years .",
    "furthermore , during that same period the blue - shifted part of the spectrum only displayed a monotonic decay .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : wolak ] the results of calculations using our superradiance model ( broken curve ) superposed to the data from @xcite ( solid curve ) for the aforementioned flaring episode of the oh 1612 mhz line .",
    "although the duration of the data does not allow us to determine if the burst of radiation taking place between approximately day 2800 and day 5000 is a single occurrence or part of a series of bursts , the longer duration of the flare ( @xmath167 days ) in comparison to case of u ori and the expected limitation on the dephasing time @xmath124 seem to imply a single flare .",
    "accordingly , our superradiance model yields @xmath168 days , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 rad ( @xmath171 ) , and provides a rewardingly nice match to the data .    as for u",
    "ori , we note that the superradiance cylinder length @xmath172 cm is orders of magnitude shorter than those expected for masers , implying that a large number of superradiant large - samples are behind the measured intensity variation , while the required dephasing time @xmath173 years ( @xmath163 sec and @xmath174 ) is markedly longer than the mean collision times previously calculated for @xmath175 @xmath50 at @xmath176 k , as expected . and , once again , because of the small size of a superradiant sample ( @xmath172 cm ) relative to typical values for the sobolev length in the cse of evolved stars , less constraining dephasing effects are anticipated .",
    "the data sets from @xcite and @xcite both indicate transitions between periods of ( quasi ) steady state maser radiation and flaring episodes . here",
    "we propose a scenario where such transitions could take place within the context of the superradiance model .",
    "we know from our discussion in section [ sec : requirements - of - superradiance ] that superradiance requires a dephasing time such that @xmath177 .",
    "we therefore surmise , because of the relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath69 given in equation ( [ eq : delay - time - large - sample ] ) , the existence of a critical value @xmath178 for the characteristic time - scale of superradiance , which can not be exceeded for superradiance to take place .",
    "that is , superradiance requires @xmath179 with    @xmath180    which in turn can be manipulated to yield , using equation ( [ eq : tr - large - sample ] ) , a corresponding critical value for the product of the inverted population density @xmath146 and the large - sample length @xmath89 . in other words , superradiance also implies a column density of inverted molecules @xmath181 with    @xmath182    in the agb phase , the mass - loss rate can change significantly during thermal pulsation periods , when the evolved star blows away its mass in the form of super winds , or when the circumstellar envelope starts detaching from the star .",
    "these variations happen over relatively short time - scales ( i.e. , on the order of a few years ) and can result in correspondingly important changes in @xmath89 and @xmath146 in an oh large - sample .",
    "however , variation in @xmath183 do not necessarily require abrupt disruptions in the cse and could happen more gradually over time or even because of local variations on smaller spatial scales .    whatever",
    "the case may be , we can therefore imagine a situation where a region harboring an oh maser could experience a change in @xmath183 that would push it above the critical value given in equation ( [ eq : nlcrit ] ) . at that point ,",
    "the region over which @xmath184 would erupt into a superradiance mode that would overtake the maser process , since superradiance is a lot more efficient at radiating the energy stored in the sample ( i.e. , the superradiance radiation intensity scales with @xmath185 ) .",
    "the initial maser radiation field itself could serve as a trigger for the superradiant event .",
    "interestingly , our superradiance models for u ori and iras18276 - 1431 show that @xmath183 ( or @xmath69 and @xmath25 ) is only a factor of a few ( at most an order of magnitude for u ori ) higher than the critical value .",
    "the time - scales of the flaring events for u ori and iras18276 - 1431 indicate , however , that the whole maser region can not at once act as a single coherent radiating system .",
    "presumably some other factor does not allow this to take place .",
    "for example , this could be because the level of velocity coherence is not high enough over the whole masing region to ensure that the corresponding dephasing time is sufficiently long to allow the entire region to act as a single superradiance system .",
    "on the other hand , velocity coherence is likely to be sufficient locally ( i.e. , on scales on the order of @xmath186 cm to @xmath65 cm for the examples considered here ) to allow for the corresponding region within the maser to break - up into a large number of smaller superradiance large - samples .",
    "our calculations presented in figures [ fig : jewell ] and [ fig : wolak ] , and their level of agreement with the corresponding data , provide credible evidence for such a scenario .",
    "it is interesting to note that from an observational standpoint a single superradiant volume over which @xmath184 is unlikely to be resolvable in view of its spot size on the sky . this would be unusual for masers , which are often resolvable through high - resolution interferometry observations .",
    "this could also imply , based on the model discussed here , that an unresolvable source in a masing region exhibiting characteristics associated with superradiance ( e.g. , the ringing effect in the intensity variations ) could be associated to a system composed of a single or a few superradiant sources operating within that region .",
    "however , as is implied by the discussion above , the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "that is , the fact that a source is spatially resolved does not imply that it can not consist of a group composed of a large number of superradiant systems .    finally , within the context of the model presented here , since a given region can make transitions between maser and superradiance modes we would expect that similar proper motion properties apply to both types of sources",
    "we have applied the concept of superradiance introduced by @xcite to the oh molecule 1612 mhz spectral line often used for the detection of masers in cses of evolved stars .",
    "as the detection of 1612 mhz oh masers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars implies the existence of a population inversion and a high level of velocity coherence , and that these are two necessary requirements for superradiance , we investigated whether superradiance can also take place in these regions .",
    "our analysis suggests that superradiance provides a valid explanation for previous observations of intensity flares detected in that spectral line for the u orionis mira star @xcite and the iras18276 - 1431 pre - planetary nebula @xcite .",
    "the confirmation of superradiance in these sources would not only reveal a new range of unexplored physical conditions in the ism but , on a more fundamental , also reveal the existence of coherent quantum mechanical systems and corresponding entangled states over length scales reaching a few times @xmath65 cm ."
