    "the acceleration is attributed to the mysterious  dark energy \" existing in our universe .",
    "the theoretical nature and origin of this dark energy are a source of much debate .",
    "candidates suggested for this dark energy can be classified according to the behavior of their respective equation of state @xmath3 .",

    "@xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite and holographic dark energy models @xcite , @xmath5 always remains bigger than @xmath2 .",
    "the phantom models of dark energy have @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent more accurate data analysis tells us a dramatic result , namely that the time varying dark energy gives a better fit than a cosmological constant and in particular , @xmath5 can cross @xmath2 around @xmath7 from above to below @xcite .",
    "theoretical attempts towards the understanding of the @xmath5 crossing @xmath2 phenomenon have been suggested , including the model containing a negative kinetic scalar field and a normal scalar field @xcite , a single scalar field model @xcite , interacting holographic dark energy models @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach which does not need dark energy to explain the late - time acceleration is motivated by string theory via the brane - world scenarios . in this scenario",
    "our universe is a 3-d brane embedded in a space - time with extra dimensions .",
    "the cosmological evolution on the brane is described by an effective friedmann equation incorporating non - trivially with the effects of the bulk onto the brane .",
    "the presence of the 5-d matter can interact with the matter contents on the brane and alter the cosmic expansion leading to a behavior resembling the dark energy .",
    "the cosmic evolution of the randall - sundrum(rs ) braneworld @xcite with energy exchange between brane and bulk has been studied @xcite . in these models , due to the energy exchange between the bulk and the brane , the usual energy conservation law on the brane",
    "is broken and consequently it was found that the equation of state of the effective dark energy can experience the transition behavior @xcite .    in string theory , in addition to the einstein action , some higher derivative curvature terms have been included to derive gravity .",
    "the combination of the einstein - hilbert and gauss - bonnet(gb ) term constitutes , for 5d spacetimes , the most general lagrangian to produce second - order field equations .",

    "it influences the evolution of the universe in our brane .",
    "effects of the gb correction on the rs braneworld have been studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to concentrate on another braneworld model introduced by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) @xcite , where the braneworld is embedded in the flat bulk with infinite extra dimensions . considering that the graviton propagates into the extra dimension , and at large scale",
    ", gravity can become weaker due to its leakage , the dgp model can realize the accelerated expansion naturally .",
    "however for the pure dgp model , its effective equation of state never goes down to the phantom phase .",
    "our main motivation here is to investigate the effects of the bulk contents in the dgp braneworld on the evolution of the universe and explore the possibility of the transition of equation of state if there are contributions from the bulk - related energy - momentum tensor components which has been observed in rs model@xcite .",
    "the dgp model only with @xmath8 has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "we are going to present a systematic and complete examination of the bulk effects including @xmath8 and @xmath0 terms on dgp model . besides we will also study the modification on the brane evolution due to the gb correction together with bulk related energy - momentum tensor components .",
    "influences of the gb correction on the pure dgp braneworld have been studied in @xcite .",
    "although the effects of the gb correction term on the late time universe is small , we will see that it still plays an important role in the early time cosmic evolution .",
    "we will show that in the dgp model the bulk matter contribution @xmath0 plays a major role in accommodating the transition of equation of state , while the @xmath8 and gb correction alone can not present a profile of the @xmath1 crossing @xmath2 phenomenon found by observations .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in section ii we will give out the basic equation sets for the dgp model by considering different correction terms respectively .",
    "the bulk effects due to @xmath0 term will be shown in detail in section iii . in section iv",

    "conclusions and discussions will be presented in the last section .",
    "the dgp brane model with gb correction starts from the action @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to the gravitational constants and the planck masses for the bulk and brane as @xcite : @xmath12 respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are cosmological constants for the bulk and brane .",
