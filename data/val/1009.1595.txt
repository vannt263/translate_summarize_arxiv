    ", the navier - stokes equation becomes a multi - scale problem with a `` slow '' time scale @xmath1 associated with the eddies at a characteristic scale @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is a characteristic velocity ) , and a `` fast '' time scale @xmath4 associated with inertial waves . the dimensionless rossby number @xmath5 is the ratio of advection to coriolis forces , and measures the influence of rotation upon the nonlinear dynamics of the system ( decreasing as rotation becomes dominant ) .",
    "resonant wave theory provides a framework to study the effect of rapid rotation in turbulence @xcite .",
    "the separation between the fast and slow time scales results in a selection of the resonant triadic interactions as the ones responsible for the energy transfer among scales . as a result",
    ", energy transfer and dissipation is substantially decreased in the presence of strong rotation @xcite .",
    "the resonant condition is also responsible for the transfer of energy towards two - dimensional ( 2d ) slow modes , driving the flow to a quasi-2d state @xcite ( this result is often referred to in the literature as the `` dynamic taylor - proudman theorem '' , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the development of anisotropy and reduction of the energy transfer and dissipation rates has been verified in numerical simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "similar arguments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that in the limit of fast rotation ( small rossby number ) the slow 2d modes decouple from the remaining fast three - dimensional ( 3d ) modes , and evolve under their own autonomous dynamics .",
    "moreover , in that limit the averaged equation for the slow modes splits into a 2d navier - stokes equation for the vertically - averaged horizontal velocity and a passive scalar equation for the vertically - averaged vertical velocity .",
    "although simulations of forced rotating flows @xcite and of ideal truncated rotating flows @xcite using periodic boundary conditions show good agreement with these predictions for small enough rossby numbers , for long times the decoupling of slow and fast modes seems to break down .",
    "also , some authors @xcite argue that in unbounded domains no decoupling is achievable even for @xmath6 .    of particular importance for many geophysical and astrophysical problems",
    "is how turbulence decays in time .",
    "the problem is also important for laboratory experiments , as it provides , e.g. , one way to measure changes in the energy dissipation rate associated with the presence of rotation . even in the absence of rotation",
    ", the decay of isotropic turbulence proves difficult to tackle because of the different decay laws obtained depending on boundary and initial conditions . as an example , for bounded flows ( i.e. , flows for which the initial characteristic length is close to the size of the vessel ) the energy decays as @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for unbounded flows ( i.e.",
    ", flows in an infinite domain , or in practice , flows for which the initial characteristic length is much smaller than the size of the vessel ) a @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 @xcite decay law is observed depending on whether the initial energy spectrum at large scales behaves as @xmath10 or @xmath11 , respectively .    in the presence of rotation ,",
    "the decay of turbulence becomes substantially richer , with decay rates depending not only on whether turbulence is bounded or unbounded and on the initial spectrum at large scales , but also , e.g. , on the strength of background rotation ( see @xcite ) . a detailed experimental study of this dependence can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the authors studied the energy decay of grid - generated turbulence in a rotating tank using particle image velocimetry , and found different decay laws depending upon the rate of rotation and the saturation ( or not ) of the characteristic size of the largest eddies . for large rossby number",
    "they reported a decay @xmath12 with exponent @xmath13 for non rotating turbulence ( consistent with the value of @xmath14 predicted in @xcite for @xmath11 unbounded turbulence ) , which later turned to @xmath15 after the largest eddies grew to the experiment size . for small rossby number",
    "this energy decay rate became smaller saturating at @xmath16 .",
    "similar results were reported in simulations in @xcite , were a decrease from @xmath17 to @xmath18 was observed as rotation was increased .",
    "these results are consistent with the reduction of the energy transfer discussed above .",
    "they also reported a steeper energy spectrum together with positive vorticity skewness for the rotating flows , and anisotropic growth of integral scales ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the decay rate of rotating turbulence also seems to depend on the helicity content of the flow .",
    "helicity ( the alignment between velocity and vorticity ) is an ideal invariant of the equations of motion ( a quantity conserved in the inviscid limit ) with intriguing properties . in the absence of rotation , the presence of helicity does not modify the energy decay rate @xcite nor the dissipation rate @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of rotation @xcite reported a further decrease of the energy transfer when both rotation and helicity were present , and @xcite showed that the decay rate of bounded rotating flows changes drastically depending on whether helicity is present or not .",
    "in this paper we conduct a detailed study of parameter space of rotating helical flows , taking into account ( 1 ) the effect of varying the characteristic scale of the initial conditions when compared with the size of the box , ( 2 ) the effect of helicity , ( 3 ) the effect of rossby and reynolds numbers , and ( 4 ) the effect of anisotropy in the initial conditions .",
    "the numerical study uses a two pronged approach combining direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and large eddy simulations ( les ) .",
    "several initial conditions are considered , although when the characteristic initial scale of the flow is smaller than the size of the domain , we focus only on the case with large scale initial energy spectrum @xmath10 .",
    "the different decay laws obtained ( which in some cases coincide with previous experimental or numerical observations , while in others are new ) are explained using phenomenological arguments , and we classify the results depending on the relevant effects on each case .    after studying the decay laws",
    ", we study the evolution of anisotropy , of skewness and kurtosis , and the formation of columnar structures in the flow . we consider how helicity affects the evolution of skewness and kurtosis , and associate peaks observed in the time evolution of these quantities with the dynamics of the columnar structures .",

    "the evolution of an incompressible fluid in a rotating frame is described by the navier - stokes equation with the coriolis force , @xmath19 and the incompressibility condition , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the velocity field , @xmath22 is the vorticity , the centrifugal term is included in the total pressure per unit of mass @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the kinematic viscosity ( uniform density is assumed ) .",
    "the rotation axis is in the @xmath25 direction , so @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the rotation frequency .    as mentioned in the introduction , these equations are solved numerically using two different methods : dns , and les using a dynamical subgrid - scale spectral model of rotating turbulence that also takes into account the helicity cascade .",
    "all simulations were performed in a three dimensional periodic box of length @xmath28 , using different spatial resolutions ranging from @xmath29 grid points for the lowest resolution les runs up to @xmath30 for the highest resolution dns .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in a dns , all spatial and time scales ( up to the dissipation scale ) are explicitly resolved .",
    "the simulations were performed using a parallelized pseudo - spectral code @xcite with the two - third rule for dealiasing . as a result ,",
    "the maximum wave number resolved in the dns is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the linear resolution ; to properly resolve the dissipative scales the condition @xmath33 must be satisfied during all simulations , where @xmath34 is the dissipation wave number . in practice , this condition is more stringent if reliable data about velocity gradients and high - order statistics of the flow are needed ( see , e.g. , @xcite , where they indicate @xmath35 for such studies ) .",
    "the dissipation wave number as a function of time was computed for all simulations in two different ways : as the kolmogorov dissipation wave number for isotropic and homogeneous turbulence @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the energy dissipation rate and @xmath38 the mean square vorticity ) , and as the wave number where the enstrophy spectrum peaks . the kolmogorov dissipation wave number was found to be always larger than the wave number where dissipation peaks , and in the following we therefore only consider the kolmogorov scale as it gives a more stringent condition on the resolution .    in all dns discussed below",
    ", the ratio @xmath39 was @xmath40 at the time of maximum dissipation ( @xmath41 to @xmath42 depending on the simulation ) , @xmath43 to @xmath44 at @xmath45 ( when the self - similar decay starts in most runs ) , and monotonously decreases to values between @xmath46 to @xmath43 at @xmath47 .",
    "the spatial resolutions used were @xmath48 and @xmath30 grid points , and an explicit second - order runge - kutta method was used to evolve in time , with a courant - friedrichs - levy ( cfl ) number smaller than one .    in the les",
    "approach , only the large scales are explicitly resolved , while the statistical impact on the resolved scales of scales smaller than a cut - off scale is modeled with simplified equations . to this end",
    "we use the spectral model derived in @xcite for isotropic helical and non - helical turbulence , and its extension to the rotating case @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the eddy damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) closure to compute eddy viscosity and eddy noise , and assumes unresolved scales ( scales smaller than the cut - off ) are isotropic .",
    "both eddy viscosity and noise are computed considering the contribution from the energy and the helicity spectra ( see , e.g. , @xcite for another subgrid model that takes into account the effect of helicity ) .",
    "the model adapts dynamically to the inertial indices of the resolved energy and helicity spectra , and as a result it is well suited to study rotating turbulence for which the scaling laws are not well known and may depend on the rossby number . for a validation of the les against dns results ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the subgrid model starts by applying a spectral filter to the equations ; this operation consists in truncating all velocity components at wave vectors @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the cut - off wave number .",
    "one then models the transfer between the large ( resolved ) scales and the small ( subgrid unresolved ) scales of the flow by adding eddy viscosity and eddy noise to the equations for the resolved scales .",
    "these are obtained solving the edqnm equations for estimated energy and helicity spectra in the subgrid range . to this end",
    ", an intermediate range is defined , lying between @xmath52 and @xmath51 ( in most cases @xmath53 ) , where the energy spectrum is assumed to present a power - law behavior possibly followed by an exponential decrease . as an example , for the energy the following expression is used : @xmath54 the coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are computed at each time step doing a mean square fit of the resolved energy spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is extrapolated to the unresolved scales using these coefficients , and the edqnm equations are solved .",
    "then one solves the navier - stokes equation ( [ eq : momentum ] ) with an extra term on the r.h.s .  which in spectral space takes the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fourier transform of the velocity field @xmath60",
    ", @xmath61 is the laplacian in fourier space , and @xmath62 is an eddy viscosity proportional to the ratio of the so - called absorption terms in edqnm to the energy ( and helicity ) spectrum .",
    "eddy noise is added in a similar manner ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "les runs using this model have a resolution of either @xmath29 or @xmath63 grid points .",
    "a pseudo - spectral method is also used , but without dealiasing , resulting in the maximum wave number @xmath64 .",
    "as in the dns , an explicit second - order runge - kutta method is used to evolve in time .",
    "parameters for all sets of runs are listed in table [ table : runs ] .",
    "dns runs are labeled with a d , followed by the linear resolution , a letter `` h '' if the run has helicity , a letter `` a '' if the initial energy spectrum is anisotropic , and the run number .",
    "les runs start with an l , followed by numbers and letters using the same convention as in the dns .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we are interested in the decay laws obtained in the system depending on properties of the initial conditions and the amount of rotation .",
    "in particular , we will vary the initial amount of helicity , the initial energy containing scale ( with respect to the largest available scale in the box ) , the shape of the energy spectrum , and the strength of turbulence and of rotation as controlled by the reynolds and rossby numbers respectively .",
    "helicity is an ideal invariant of the navier - stokes equation which measures the alignment between velocity and vorticity . if zero , the initial conditions are mirror - symmetric , so it also measures the departure from a mirror - symmetric state .",
    "we define the net helicity as @xmath65 where the brackets denote spatial average .",
    "we also define the relative helicity as @xmath66 which is bounded between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and can be interpreted as the mean cosine of the angle between the velocity and the vorticity .",
    "to control the net amount of relative helicity in the initial conditions we consider three different flows : a superposition of taylor - green ( tg ) vortices @xcite , @xmath69 a superposition of arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) flows @xcite , @xmath70\\hat{x}+\\nonumber \\\\ { } & & \\left[c\\cos(k_0z)+a\\sin(k_0x)\\right]\\hat{y } + \\nonumber \\\\ { } & & \\left[a\\cos(k_0x)+b\\sin(k_0y)\\right]\\hat{z } , \\label{eq : abc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ) , and a superposition of fourier modes with random phases ( rnd ) in which we use the algorithm described in @xcite to control the relative helicity . in each case",
    ", the flows are superposed in a range of wave numbers as described in table [ tab : paratable ] , and with global amplitudes for each wave number to give the desired slope in the initial energy spectrum .",
    "the tg vortex is non - helical ( @xmath74 ) and has no energy in the @xmath75 modes , whose amplification in the rotating cases ( see below ) can thus be attributed only to a bidimensionalization process .",
    "the tg vortex was originally motivated as an initial condition which leads to rapid development of small spatial scales , and also mimics the von krmn flow between two counter - rotating disks used in several experiments @xcite .",
    "the abc flow is an eigenfunction of the curl operator and as a result has maximum helicity ( @xmath76 depending on the sign of @xmath77 , when only one value of @xmath77 is excited ) , whereas the rnd flow allows us to tune the amount of initial relative helicity between @xmath67 and 1 as well as the initial anisotropy .    when generating the flows , two different initial energy spectra were considered .",
    "to study initial conditions with characteristic length close to the size of the computational domain , a spectrum @xmath78 for @xmath79 $ ] ( followed by exponential decay ) was imposed . to study initial conditions with length smaller than the domain size",
    ", we imposed a spectrum @xmath80 for @xmath81 $ ] , @xmath82 $ ] , or @xmath83 $ ] ( also followed by exponential decay ) . in the latter case",
    ", the characteristic length can grow in time as the spectrum peaks around @xmath84 , @xmath85 , or @xmath86 .",
    "this allows us to mimic ( at least for a finite time before the characteristic length reaches the domain size ) the decay of unbounded flows .",
    "the characteristic length will be associated in the following with the flow integral scale , which is defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the isotropic energy spectrum .",
    "simulations in table [ tab : paratable ] are also characterized by different reynolds and rossby numbers .",
    "the reynolds and rossby numbers in the table are defined as @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "of importance is also the micro - scale rossby number ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath91 which can be interpreted as the ratio of the convective to the coriolis acceleration at the taylor scale .",
    "the rossby number @xmath5 must be small enough for rotation to affect the turbulence , while the micro - rossby number @xmath92 must be larger than one for scrambling effects of inertial waves not to completely damp the nonlinear term , which would lead to pure exponential viscous energy decay @xcite . in",
    "all runs in table [ tab : paratable ] , @xmath5 and @xmath92 are one order of magnitude apart at the time of maximum enstrophy @xmath93 , and this interval is roughly preserved throughout the simulations .    here and in the following",
    ", the isotropic energy spectrum is defined by averaging in fourier space over spherical shells @xmath94 where @xmath59 is the fourier transform of the velocity field , and the asterisk denotes complex conjugate .",
    "other two spectra can also be used to characterize anisotropy .    on the one hand ,",
    "the so - called `` reduced '' energy spectra @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined averaging in fourier space over cylinders and planes respectively .",
    "more specifically , the reduced energy spectra as a function of wave numbers @xmath97 with @xmath98 , and @xmath99 with @xmath100 , are defined by computing the sum above over all modes in the cylindrical shells @xmath101 and over planes @xmath102 respectively ( isotropic and reduced spectra for the helicity are defined in the same way ) . from the reduced spectra ,",
    "perpendicular and parallel integral scales can be defined ; e.g. , for the perpendicular direction , @xmath103    on the other hand , more information of the spectral anisotropy can be obtained studying the axisymmetric energy spectrum @xmath104 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . assuming the flow is axisymmetric , the three - dimensional spectrum can be integrated around the axis of rotation to obtain a spectrum that depends only on @xmath105 and @xmath97 , which relates to the reduced energy spectra as follows : @xmath106 and @xmath107     slope is shown as a reference .",

    "however , our simulations further show that in the presence of rotation helicity can further decrease this decay .",
    "this is different from the non - rotating case , where helicity does not affect the self - similar decay of energy .",
    "this result , together with previous studies in the case of forced rotating flows @xcite further confirm that helicity plays a more important role in rotating turbulence than what it does in the isotropic and homogeneous case .    in the presence of rotation , the decay of enstrophy",
    "is well described by phenomenological arguments based on isotropic scaling .",
    "this can be expected as enstrophy ( as well as helicity ) is a small - scale quantity , more isotropic than the energy .",
    "the energy in rotating non - helical flows follows either a decay close to a @xmath262 law ( when the integral scale of the flow is close to the size of the box ) , or a decay slightly steeper than @xmath193 ( when the integral scale is smaller than the size of the box , and the large scale energy spectrum is @xmath10 ) .",
    "better agreement with power - law decay is obtained when the evolution of 2d modes and 3d modes is considered separately . in that case",
    ", the energy in 2d modes decays close to @xmath145 , and the 3d modes decay as in the non - rotating case , i.e. , close to @xmath144 .",
    "these power - law decays can be obtained from phenomenological arguments that consider the energy in 2d and 3d modes separately , that assume approximately constant axisymmetric integrals instead of the isotropic loitsyanski s integral , and that take into account the slow down in the energy transfer associated with rotation .",
    "note we are not claiming there is decoupling between 2d and 3d modes in rotating flows , a topic which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "what we show instead is that the energy in 2d and 3d modes in the simulations decay with different rates , both following power laws , and that considering this in the phenomenological description gives better agreement with the numerical results .",
    "the decay of energy in the presence of rotation and helicity shows further variety . when the integral scale of the flow is close to the size of the box , the energy decay is close to @xmath197 .",
    "this decay can be obtained from phenomenological arguments taking into account the role played by the helicity cascade in further slowing down the energy transfer . in simulations with integral scale smaller than the size of the box , the decay is between @xmath190 and @xmath192 . as in the non - helical case ,",
    "clearer power laws arise if the decay of @xmath143 and @xmath199 is considered . in that case",
    ", @xmath143 shows decays between @xmath201 and @xmath235 , and @xmath199 shows decays close to either @xmath263 or @xmath264 .",
    "the results with helicity seem to be more dependent on scale separation ( i.e. , on the separation between the initial integral scale of the flow , and the size of the box ) , and on initial anisotropy .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the importance of the initial conditions in the decay of rotating turbulence has been recently pointed out also in experiments @xcite .",
    "finally , we presented a study of the time evolution of the skewness and kurtosis of velocity derivatives .",
    "two - dimensionalization of rotating flows leads to an anti - correlation of the @xmath241 and @xmath242 components of the skewness , which fluctuate around zero .",
    "large departures of these quantities from this value are associated with merging events of columns in the flow .",
