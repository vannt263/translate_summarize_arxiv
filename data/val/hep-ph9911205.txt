    "the predicted @xmath1 asymmetry in the @xmath3 leptoproduction for @xmath94 is smaller than 1.5% .",
    "the nonzero asymmetry for @xmath95 is completely determined by the @xmath96 term in the pomeron coupling ( [ ver ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1 asymmetry in diffractive processes for nonzero momentum transfer has been found dependent on the @xmath29 term of the pomeron coupling which has a spin dependent nature .",
    "however , the sensitivity of asymmetry to the @xmath82ratio is quite weak .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 asymmetry in diffractive reactions is not a good tool to study the polarized gluon distributions of the proton and spin structure of the pomeron .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath2 asymmetry in diffractive @xmath3 production might be about 10 - 20% .",
    "this asymmetry is proportional to @xmath82 and might be used to obtain direct information about the spin structure of pomeron coupling and the skewed polarized gluon structure functions of the proton .",
    "we would like to stress that the spin - dependent amplitude in the diffractive reaction is more sensitive to the model of the pomeron interaction than the spin - average one . some tricks in calculations , which restore the gauge invariance of the scattering amplitude , can simplify investigation of @xmath97 ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , they do not work for @xmath98 .",
    "we consider the full perturbative calculation which includes all possible @xmath7-channel gluon exchanges as the most reliable method to study the spin effects in diffractive reactions .",
    "future polarized diffractive experiments might be an important test of the spin structure of qcd at large distances and of the different theoretical approaches to diffractive reactions .",
