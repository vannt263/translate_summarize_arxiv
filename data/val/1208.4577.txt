    "our universe is observed to be homogeneous and isotropic at large distances from super - galactic scales ( @xmath0 mpc ) to the whole visible universe ( @xmath1 mpc ) .",
    "moreover , the power spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations on such large scales is measured to be nearly scale invariant . according to the current view",
    ", these perturbations arose as quantum fluctuations in the early universe , then left the horizon before the standard expansion phase , only to recently reenter .",
    "the evolution of the adiabatic fluctuations in the early universe are determined by the equation of state @xmath2 and the speed of sound @xmath3 .",
    "the question is , which types of early cosmic evolution @xmath4 would give rise to the observed 10 e - folds of nearly scale invariant perturbations ?    in a common class of models for generating scale invariant perturbations , the universe is dominated by a scalar field with the canonical kinetic term and certain potential term . in this case @xmath3 equals @xmath5 , and the evolution of the scale factor @xmath6 , hence @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is determined by the form of the potential .",

    ", @xmath9 stays nearly constant and close to @xmath10 , while the scale factor @xmath6 grows exponentially , pushing a wide range of length scales outside the horizon . in the adiabatic ekpyrotic scenario @xcite , however , the scale factor @xmath6 contracts slowly while @xmath9 increases rapidly , so that the horizon scale shrinks and leaves a wide range of perturbation modes outside .",
    "the scale invariant modes created in a contraction phase can be carried on to the standard expansion phase through a cosmic bounce @xcite .    for a constant @xmath3 ,",
    "the scale invariance of the power spectrum fully constrains the time dependence of the scale factor @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in addition to inflation and adiabatic ekpyrosis , there is a third type of solution in which the universe goes through an `` apex '' @xcite , a slow transition from expansion to contraction .",
    "similar to adiabatic ekpyrosis , this scenario also depends on a rapidly changing @xmath9 while the scale factor @xmath6 is nearly constant .",
    "one difference is that here the scale invariant modes are generated during the slow expansion phase before the apex , instead of during a slow contraction phase .",
    "more generally , the speed of sound @xmath3 may vary with time , as in single field models with a noncanonical kinetic term .",
    "several models involving a time varying @xmath3 have been considered . in the tachyacoustic expansion scenario @xcite , @xmath9",
    "is assumed to be constant , and the scale invariant power spectrum is produced by having a suitable time dependence of the speed of sound @xmath3 .",
    "another example is considered in @xcite where @xmath3 is taken to be proportional to @xmath9 , so that the three - point function of the curvature perturbation is also scale invariant .    with",
    "a time dependent @xmath3 , the requirement of a scale invariant power spectrum alone does not fully determine the cosmic evolution . there exist infinitely many combinations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 that can all produce scale invariant perturbations .",
    "we would like to know if these different scenarios can be described and categorized into distinctive classes of cosmological models .",
    "in this paper we present a general scheme to describe single field cosmological models by a new set of flow parameters .",

    "the requirement of a scale invariant power spectrum constrains the dynamics of the flow parameters and determines particular classes of trajectories .",
    "we show that all existing models correspond to nearly constant values of the flow parameters . by looking for fixed points in the parameter space , we find four general types of models that encompass inflation , adiabatic ekpyrosis , apex , and tachyacoustic expansion respectively .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the flow lines near the fixed points in different cross sections of the parameter space . by looking for various behavior of each fixed point ,",
    "we obtain new cosmological models that can produce scale invariant perturbations equally well .",
    "our approach is very different from the conventional way of starting from a particular scalar field lagrangian and studing its cosmological solutions . in that approach , generally speaking , only solutions in a limited region of field phase space would yield scale invariant perturbations , corresponding to a particular type of mechanism represented by some part of the flow parameter space . in our approach , however , by tracing the flow lines in the whole parameter space , we obtain all possible cosmic evolutions that can create a scale invariant power spectrum .",
    "each and every flow line leads to scale invariant perturbations , but different trajectories may correspond to very different scalar field models .",
    "this approach effectively avoids the limitations of particular scalar field models .    in section  [ sec : flow ]",

    "this can be done by having a subsequent ekpyrotic phase to push the modes outside the hubble horizon , such as in @xcite .    moreover , since the cosmological models assume classical general relativity , for consistency the energy density of the universe should remain sub - planckian , @xmath304 . to estimate the size of the hubble parameter when the scale invariant modes are generated , taking @xmath47 in eq .",

    "<S> we introduce a new set of flow parameters to describe the time dependence of the equation of state and the speed of sound in single field cosmological models . </S>",

    "<S> we analyze the flow of these parameters and find four types of fixed points that encompass all known single field models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , near each fixed point we uncover new models where the scale invariance of the power spectrum relies on having simultaneously time varying speed of sound and equation of state . </S>",
