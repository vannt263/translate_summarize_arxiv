    "in an earlier paper ( romer et al . 2001 , r01 hereafter ) we described the expected catalog properties and scientific applications of an _ xmm - newton _ cluster survey ( xcs ) based on serendipitous detections in pointed observations .",
    "we revisit these predictions below , in light of improved knowledge of the in flight performance of _ xmm_. we also compare the xcs to other on - going x - ray surveys .",
    "[ cluster - numbers ]    .the expected number of @xmath2 kev clusters detected by the xcs as a function of cosmology .",
    "column @xmath3 , the original xcs predictions for @xmath4 detections from r01",
    ". columns @xmath5 and @xmath6 , updated xcs predictions based on the measured in flight internal background count rate .",
    "all the results assume a final survey area of 800 sq .",
    "@xmath7there was a typo in the the printed version of r01 , this is the correct value . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "recently it has come to light that the quiescent internal background count rates in the epic detectors are roughly ten times higher than was anticipated prior to the _ xmm - newton _ launch ( see lumb 2001 ) .",
    "we have , therefore , recomputed the expected properties of the xcs cluster catalog using a total ( external plus internal ) background level that is roughly double that used in r01 . in table  1",
    ", we compare the new predictions ( column _ ii _ ) with those published in table  4 of r01 ( column _ i _ ) .",
    "for example , for an open model ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , we now predict that the xcs will detect 390 @xmath2 kev , @xmath1 clusters at @xmath10 , compared to 480 in r01 .",
    "changes at that level should not severely limit the ability of xcs to differentiate between open and flat cosmological models .",
    "we have also included in table  1 predictions for the number of xcs clusters that would be detected at @xmath0 .",
    "we did not include low signal to noise detections in r01 because they will be hard to identify using an extent criterion alone .",
    "however , when combined with planck and/or sdss data , it may be possible to identify these objects in a timely and quantifiable manner , so we include them here for completeness .",
    "the redshift distribution of the @xmath11 and @xmath10 xcs detections can be seen in figure  1 .",
    "the massive cluster survey ( macs , ebeling , edge & henry 2001 ) has been very successful at identifying high redshift , high luminosity , clusters detected in 22,735 square degrees of the rosat all sky survey . the wide areal coverage of the macs ( nearly 30 times that of the xcs ! ) results in sensitivity to a very interesting class of clusters , those at medium redshift and high luminosity ( @xmath12 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 ; 0.1 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "macs clusters are already being used for a variety science programs including studies of cluster evolution and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .    using the r01 methodology and based on the macs selection function presented in figure  5 of ebeling et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we have been able to predict the number of clusters that would be detected by macs as a function of cosmology .",
    "we present those results in figure  1 and table  1 .",
    "overall , we can expect macs to detect between 100 and 500 clusters at @xmath15 , depending on cosmology .",
    "an _ xmm _ slew survey has been proposed ( _ e.g. _ lumb & jones 2000 ) . an _",
    "xmm _ slew survey would have two important advantages over the xcs ; it would be drawn from random parts of the sky ( rather than from regions that surround known x - ray targets ) and it would cover significantly more area .",
    "lumb & jones ( 2000 ) estimated an annual survey rate of 4000 square degrees to a flux limit of @xmath16 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "this compares to an estimated annual survey rate for the xcs of @xmath17 square degrees ( the xcs catalog will not have a single flux limit , but a typical value will be @xmath18 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band , see r01 ) .    we have attempted to predict the properties of a slew survey cluster catalog using the r01 methodology . at the time of writing , the slew survey had only just begun and the actual sensitivity level was unknown ( lumb , private communication ) .",
    "we , therefore , present results for two different ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) flux limits ; @xmath16 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 and @xmath19 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 , see figure  2 . we have assumed that 4000 square degrees would be covered in one year by the slew survey . for comparison",
    "we have shown the expected numbers of clusters that would be detected at @xmath11 in one year of the xcs ( or 80 square degrees ) .",
    "a slew survey with @xmath16 erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 sensitivity would produce a very impressive cluster catalog at low and medium redshifts .",
    "such a catalog would have a variety of applications including constraints on @xmath20 and @xmath21 and studies of cluster evolution and planck foregrounds .    in summary , the macs and the _ xmm _ slew surveys have much better low redshift sensitivity than xcs by virtue of their large areal coverage .",
    "however , neither will be able to differentiate between open and flat low @xmath22 models , because they lack sensitivity to high redshift clusters .",
    "these surveys should be seen as complementary too , not in competition with , the xcs .",
    "the xcs faces many challenges , including the complexity of its selection function and our lack of understanding of cluster evolution .",
    "the future existence of the xcs should not deter the launch of a dedicated x - ray survey satellite ."
