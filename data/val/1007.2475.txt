    "the conjectured equivalence of string theory on anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces ( times some compact manifold ) and certain superconformal gauge theories living on the boundary of ads @xcite has lead to an increasing interest in asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes .",
    "this conjecture is now a fundamental concept that furnishes a means for calculating the action and conserved quantities intrinsically without reliance on any reference spacetime @xcite .",
    "also , coupling between gravity and gauge fields is a common feature of many unification theories in higher dimensions bailin . in supergravity theories ,",
    "such gauge fields are frequently essential in order to complete the multiple structure and to guarantee the invariance of the lagrangian with respect to local supersymmetry transformations @xcite .",
    "they can provide , in some cases , a dynamical mechanism for the compactification of extra dimensions @xcite .    in this supersymmetric context",
    ", they can lead to a geometric interpretation in the superspace .",
    "the simplest example of coupling of a gauge field to gravity is the einstein - maxwell system in four dimensions , whose extension to higher dimensions can lead to some interesting features : its reduction to four dimensions implies a non - trivial coupling of the electromagnetic field to gravity . in the conventional , straightforward generalization of the maxwell field to higher dimensions one essential property of the electromagnetic field is lost , namely , conformal invariance .    the reissner - nordstrm black hole , the first solution for which the matter source is conformally invariant , is an electrically charged but non - rotating black hole solution in four dimensions .",
    "there exists a conformally invariant extension of the maxwell ( cim ) action in higher dimensions , if one uses the lagrangian of the @xmath0 gauge field in the form:@xmath3where @xmath4 is the maxwell tensor and @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the action ( [ cim ] ) is invariant under conformal transformation ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and for @xmath8 , the action ( [ cim ] ) reduces to the maxwell action as it should be .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor associated to @xmath9 is given by @xmath10where @xmath11 and it is easy to show that @xmath12 @xcite . as one can see the clue of the conformal invariance lies in the fact that we have considered power of the maxwell invariant .",
    "this idea has been applied in the case of scalar field for which it has been shown that particular power of the massless klein - gordon lagrangian exhibits conformal invariance in arbitrary dimension haissene .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether black hole solutions can also be obtained in this case .",
    "in what follows , we have been considered the action ( [ cim ] ) as the matter source coupled to the einstein gravity to take advantage of the conformal symmetry to construct the analogues of the four - dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "the form of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ t ] ) , automatically restricts the dimensions to be only multiples of four .",
    "however , the black hole solutions which have been studied so far represent only a special case of the general black hole solution since rotation has been ignored @xcite . to see whether qualitative properties of generic black holes depend on the matter content , one must consider rotating charged black holes @xcite .",
    "this is the subject of the present investigation . indeed ,",
    "in this paper we obtain a class of higher dimensional solution of rotating black branes with a conformally invariant maxwell source in the presence of cosmological constant .",
    "these solutions contain three conserved quantities , the mass @xmath13 , electrical charge @xmath14 , and angular momentum @xmath15 . by calculation of other thermodynamic quantities , we show that thermodynamic and conserved quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . also , we investigate the stability of charged rotating black brane solutions in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "in fact , the hawking - page phase transition for the schwarzschild - ads black hole @xcite does not occur for asymptotically locally anti - de sitter black holes whose horizons have vanishing or negative constant curvature , and they are thermodynamically locally stable since they have a positive heat capacity @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of electric charge further modifies the thermodynamical properties of black holes and a more complex phase structure arises , allowing for an analogous of the hawking - page phase transition @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ fiel ] , we give a brief review of the field equations of einstein gravity with conformally invariant maxwell field in the presence of cosmological constant and review the counterterm method for calculating the conserved quantities of the solutions . in sec .",
    "[ static sol ] , we obtain the @xmath16-dimensional static solutions of field equations , which are asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter or flat",
    ". then , we present a new class of charged rotating black brane solutions and investigate their properties in sec .",
    "[ sol ] . in sec .",
    "[ therm ] we obtain mass , angular momentum , entropy , temperature , charge , and electric potential of the rotating black brane solutions and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we also perform a local stability analysis of the black branes in the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "in @xmath8 , the action of einstein - maxwell is trivial , but for @xmath17 dimensions with @xmath18 , we consider the einstein action with a conformally invariant maxwell action given by @xmath19 \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{8\\pi } \\int_{\\partial \\mathcal{m}}d^{4p+3}x\\sqrt{_{-}\\gamma } % \\theta ( \\gamma ) ,   \\nonumber   \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the negative cosmological constant which is equal to @xmath21 for asymptotically ads solutions , where @xmath22  is a scale length factor ; @xmath5 is a constants and @xmath23 is scalar curvature .",

    "the action @xmath33 , is divergent when evaluated on the solutions , as is the hamiltonian and other associated conserved quantities .",
    "a systematic method of dealing with this divergence in einstein gravity is through the use of the counterterms method inspired by the anti - de sitter conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite . in einstein gravity",
    ", there exists only one counterterm and therefore the total finite action is @xmath34where the counterterm action is @xmath35having the total finite action one can construct a divergence - free stress energy tensor by use the brown - york definition @xcite .",

    "usually entropy of the black holes satisfies the so - called area law of entropy which states that the black hole entropy equals to one - quarter of horizon area @xcite .",
