    "understanding stellar convection and accurately representing it in stellar models remains a formidable challenge .",
    "one of the commonly used treatments for convection is the mixing length theory ( mlt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,  which represents convection with a characteristic length scale .",
    "the mixing length parameter ( which is the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height , @xmath3 ) sets the specific entropy of the convection zone , which in turn adjusts the stellar radius .",
    "this provides a means of determining the mixing length parameter for the sun , since we have precise constraints on the solar radius .",
    "this solar - calibrated value for the mixing length parameter is usually used to model all other stars , but there is evidence suggesting that this is not the case in reality .    even when properly calibrated to the stellar radius , mlt - like treatments of stellar convection fail to accurately represent inefficient convection .",
    "this failure severely limits the accuracy of the convective envelope boundaries within stellar models .",
    "one such boundary is the superadiabatic layer ( sal ) , which is a region near the surface of stars with convective envelopes .",
    "this layer spans several scale heights and encompasses the transition from efficient convective energy transport to radiative .",
    "radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations of the sal have proven to be a useful tool for studying realistic stellar convection .",
    "simulations self - consistently couple the convective envelope to the radiative atmosphere , while including important physical processes such as turbulent pressure .",

    "efforts to methodically simulate convection in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane reveal a significant and systematic variation in convective properties over a broad range in stellar properties .",
    "in addition to stellar properties , the convective dynamics near the stellar surface are affected by the chemical composition of the convective envelope .",
    "the recent observational study by @xcite and theoretical work by @xcite both suggest that the stellar surface convection depends on the chemical composition of the convective envelope .",
    "similar results are obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined helium abundance in 2d simulations , and found that the helium - free case was characterized by larger velocities and flow structures .",
    "the abundance of helium and its effect on stellar convection , however , has not yet been examined systematically . in this study",
    "we build upon our previous work by adding helium abundance to the parameter space of our simulation grid , and isolate its effect on convection by fixing the other dimensions of parameter space .",
    "it is difficult to measure spectroscopically the helium mass fraction present in stars that are cool enough to have convective envelopes .",
    "asteroseismology permits constraints on the helium abundance through measurements of low degree acoustic modes @xcite , however helium abundance in stars remains largely unconstrained .",
    "the common practice is to use a chemical evolution formula , such as that of @xcite . quite separately from chemical evolution , the helium content may be enriched or depleted in stellar envelopes through processes such as rotationally induced mixing and meridional circulation .",
    "for example , the multiple stellar populations present in @xmath6 centauri can be modeled if rather extreme helium abundances are used .",
    "a recent study by @xcite finds that helium mass fractions in excess of @xmath7 yield the best models for certain ehb stars .",
    "conversely , helium could be depleted in the outer layers of stars as a result of diffusion from the gravitational settling ( * ? ? ?",

    "describe the 3d rhd code and the grid of simulations used in this work .",
    "section [ sec : microphysics ] outlines the changes to the microphysics induced by altering the hydrogen mass fraction , and the expected effect that these changes will have on convective dynamics .",
    "we then examine in detail the consequences of hydrogen abundance on various properties extracted from the simulations in sections [ sec : salstructure ] through [ sec : spectral ] .",
    "our code simulates convection by solving the compressible navier - stokes equations with radiative transfer , and has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the code is originally based on that of @xcite and @xcite but has updated physics and numerical schemes .",
    "the simulation code uses microphysics that are fully consistent with that of the stellar evolution code yrec .",
    "the equation of state and opacity are taken from the opal tables @xcite and the @xcite opacity tables at low temperatures using the heavy element mixture of @xcite .",
    "for the simulations in this work , radiative transfer was computed using the 3d eddington approximation @xcite in the optically thin layers , and the diffusion approximation in the deeper optically thick layers , however , as @xcite showed , using a different radiative transfer scheme ( rays with long - characteristics ) does not make a substantial difference in the sal below the photosphere .",
    "the computational domain is a cartesian box with periodic boundary conditions on the vertical walls , and the top and bottom surfaces are closed .",
    "spatial curvature and the radial variation of gravity are both negligible .",
    "the domain spans the sal so the bottom surface is well below the superadiabatic peak , and the top surface is in the optically thin radiative layers of the atmosphere .",
    "thus , the space between the two surfaces encompasses the transition from fully convective to fully radiative energy transport .",
    "the strategy for exploring the effect of helium on convection closely mirrors the approach described in @xcite , which dealt only with changes to the mass fraction of metal elements . in this study",
    ", we construct a grid of simulations that covers a range in helium mass fractions .",
    "because the effect of helium may differ between metal - rich and metal - poor stars , we compute our simulations with different hydrogen mass fractions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) for two different metallicities ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the grid of simulations comprises six sets , each with a different chemical composition .",
    "the grid is divided into two groups ( each with three sets ) , corresponding to low and high metallicity .",
    "the sets within a group have fixed metallicity , but different helium abundances .",
    "the range in helium and metallicity is quite large , covering a factor of three in @xmath13 and a factor of @xmath14 in @xmath15 . while large , the range in helium mass fraction is less extreme than what has been used to model some stellar populations , including that of @xmath6 centauri , which @xcite recently modeled with helium enrichments of up to @xmath7 .",
    "the grid of 24 simulations is summarized in table [ tab : grid ] .",
    "the two metallicity groups are denoted with ` a ' and ` b ' for the low- and high - metallicity , respectively .",
    "surface gravity is held fixed at @xmath16 for the entire grid .",
    "the effective temperature for each simulation is an output property , and can not be precisely controlled . as such",
    ", simulations typically can not be directly compared , but each set overlaps in the effective temperature range , allowing for comparisons as a function of radiative flux .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the signature of helium abundance on stellar convection is smaller than that of metallicity , but is nonetheless significant .",
    "changes to convective properties are primarily caused by opacity .",
    "the sensitivity of convective properties to helium abundance is because of similar reasons as metallicity described in @xcite , namely , for a given , an increase in opacity in the sal is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in density so that the constant radiative energy flux is maintained .",
    "our simulations show systematically larger convective velocities and overshoot with hotter , larger @xmath15 and smaller @xmath13 .    while similar , the effect of helium is distinct from that of metallicity because of the way in which it changes the equation of state .",
    "the mean molecular weight is more sensitive to helium abundance , particularly in the optically thin layers above the maximum superadiabaticity .",
    "the signature of helium might manifest itself separately from that of metallicity in the details of the velocity field , such as the velocity distribution presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity ] .",
    "the key to isolating the effect of helium may be in comparing the hot upflows and cool downdrafts .",
    "[ fig : velocity ] shows variation in the ` upflow ' peak with @xmath15 , and variation in the extreme edge of the ` downflow ' peak with @xmath13 .",
    "radiation accounts for most of the energy flux from the hot upflowing granules",
    ". consequently , the structure and dynamics of the granules are more sensitive to radiative cooling rates , which vary more strongly with metallicity than helium .",
    "conversely , the downflows are less sensitive to radiative cooling rates , but will be affected by the mean molecular weight .",
    "it is possible that the signature of helium abundance is observable through its effect on the convective overshoot in the atmosphere .",
    "in particular , the curvature of spectral line shapes and the absolute shift of the line cores are sensitive to helium abundance .",
    "provided that the metallicity are well constrained , it might be possible to isolate the effect of helium on the velocity field .",
    "old metal - poor stellar populations often exhibit signs of @xmath0-element enrichment . using a set of simulations",
    "separate from our grid , we have carried out tests to measure the magnitude of the effect of changing the heavy element mixture .",
    "details of the heavy element mixture alter the opacity because of changes in the number of ionized electrons , which affects h@xmath17 opacity .",
    "our simulations show that the effect is quite small ; considerably smaller than the effect of changing @xmath15 or @xmath13 . while @xmath0-element enrichment may have a more substantial effect in the deep interior of the star",
    ", we do not measure a significant dependence on the structure of the sal .",
    "our @xmath0-enhancement tests also verify that the effect of helium could not be accounted for by adjusting the heavy element mixture .",
