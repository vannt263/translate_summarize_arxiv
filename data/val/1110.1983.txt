    "the atlas detector@xcite , one of the two general - purpose experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , has been taking proton - proton collision data at a centre - of - mass energy of 7  tev since march 2010 . the atlas inner detector ( id)@xcite combines silicon detector technology ( pixels@xcite and microstrips@xcite ) in the innermost part with a straw drift detector@xcite with transition radiation detection capabilities ( transition radiation tracker , trt ) on the outside , operating in a 2-t superconducting solenoid .    the microstrip detector ( semiconductor tracker , sct ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : id ] , forms the middle layer of the i d between the pixel detector and the trt .",
    "the sct system comprises a barrel@xcite made of four nested cylinders and two end - caps@xcite of nine disks each .",
    "the barrel layers carry 2112  detector units ( modules)@xcite altogether , while a total of 1976  end - cap modules@xcite are mounted on the disks .",
    "the whole sct occupies a cylinder of 5.6  m in length and 56  cm in radius with the innermost layer at a radius of 27  cm .",
    "the silicon modules@xcite consist of one or two pairs of single - sided p-_in_-n microstrip sensors glued back - to - back at a 40-mrad stereo angle to provide two - dimensional track reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 thick sensors@xcite have 768 ac - coupled strips with an @xmath2 pitch for the barrel and a pitch for the end - cap modules .",
    "barrel modules follow one common design , while for the forward ones four different types exist according to their position in the detector .",
    "the readout@xcite of each module is based on 12  abcd3ta asics@xcite manufactured in the radiation - hard dmill process mounted on a copper / kapton hybrid .",
    "each module is designed , constructed and tested to operate as a stand - alone unit , mechanically , electrically , optically and thermally .",
    "the performance of the sct modules and substructures have been repeatedly tested in the past in dedicated beam tests ( before 2004 ) , during the combined test beam with other i d components in summer 2004 and with cosmic rays@xcite both on the surface and after installation in the atlas cavern . since autumn",
    "2009 various aspects of the sct operation have been studied continuously while recording physics data in @xmath3 collisions at 900  gev , 2.36  tev and , since march 2010 , at 7  tev .",
    "the sct performs very well with increasing collision rate , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : error1 ] , where the fraction of sct module sides giving errors as a function of time is shown .",
    "it is stressed that the time interval spans an increasing instantaneous luminosity of five orders of magnitude .",
    "the sct data - quality inefficiency is mainly due to hv ramping up during lhc stable - beam declaration , with an overall 99.9% operation efficiency .",
    "the total fraction of data with sct errors remained less than 0.25% throughout 2010 .",
    "the only issues encountered affecting the  otherwise stable  sct configuration are : ( a ) a faulty connection to a cooling loop@xcite discovered during commissioning , that can not be repaired since it is located behind the endplate ; and ( b ) some unexpected failures@xcite of off - detector optical transmitters ( tx - plugins)@xcite that are being replaced by humidity - resistant plugins . in total , more than 99% of all sct modules are fully operational .",
    "noise measurements are performed by two methods:@xcite injection of calibration pulses and noise estimation from response - curve fit ; and measuring noise occupancy as a function of threshold to extract the input noise .",
    "the measured values are well correlated and , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : no - strips ] ( left ) , the noise occupancy is well below the required level of @xmath4 .",
    "good agreement has been observed between monte carlo and 900  gev data in the number of hits per module side , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : no - strips ] ( right ) .",
    "the discrepancy at low @xmath5 is due to the lower noise assumed in simulation compared to data by approximately a factor of three .",
    "as far as the sct timing@xcite is concerned , per - module adjustments are made to account for the optical fibre length and the time - of - flight from the interaction point though timing scans .",
    "the related measurements show that the sct is well synchronized with the level-1 trigger .",
    "the lorentz angle as determined by finding the angle corresponding to the minimum cluster width is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lorenz - eff ] ( left ) for the barrel layers and for various data / conditions .",
    "the measurements agree well with the predictions , proving the good signal digitization in the full simulation .",
    "the intrinsic strip efficiency is computed by counting missed hits in well - reconstructed tracks with @xmath6 , excluding dead modules and chips .",
    "the sct hit efficiency for all three sct parts ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lorenz - eff ] , right , for the end - cap c ) is well above the 99% specification .",
    "the radiation damage is being monitored through the leakage current .",
    "the comparison between measurements and fluka@xcite predictions of the fluence shows good agreement in the barrel region , whilst a discrepancy in the low-@xmath7 forward region is under study .",
    "the leakage current evolution with time lies within @xmath8 of the predicted values .",
    "the long - term monitoring of the effect during operation continues .",
    "the atlas semiconductor tracker performance shows excellent performance .",
    "a total of 99.1% of the sct modules are used for data taking . noise occupancy and hit efficiency are well within the design specifications .",
    "the optical transmitter failures are understood and do not impair data taking efficiency .",
    "the monte carlo simulation reproduces accurately the detector geometry and material budget .",
    "the radiation damage is being monitored and is in good agreement with expectations .",
    "the sct is a key precision tracking device in atlas and we are taking more and more good physics data every day .",
    "the sct commissioning and running experience is used to extract valuable lessons for future silicon strip detector projects .",
