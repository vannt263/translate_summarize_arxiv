    "recently , there has been increased interest in the interaction of single matter systems like atoms , molecules or ions with weak light beams or single photons in free space .",
    "the topical spread covers scattering by single two - level systems @xcite as well as the absorption of single photons by single atoms @xcite . also other applications relying on high numerical aperture ( na ) optics",
    "have raised increasing attention , involving parabolic mirrors @xcite as well as lenses  @xcite .",
    "it is common to all these applications that they require the smallest possible focal volume or  in other words  that the power incident onto the focusing optics is transformed in such a way that the electric energy density in the focus is maximized .",
    "thus , one wants to maximize the amplitude of the electric field in the focus .",
    "although it is well known since quite some time that the optimum performance is achieved by electric dipole radiation @xcite and also some newer publications hint in this direction @xcite , this recipe is followed only in few papers in a consequent manner @xcite .",
    "there are also publications in which some sort of optimization procedure is followed : in ref .",
    "@xcite the beam width of a circularly polarized fundamental gaussian is varied in order to maximize the strength of the circularly polarized field component in the focus of an aspheric lens .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite follow a similar procedure in varying the beam waist of a radially polarized doughnut beam during minimization of the focal volume in the case of a parabolic mirror . in both cases ,",
    "the optimization procedure is equivalent to maximizing the overlap of the incident radiation with dipole radiation . in the former case @xcite the gaussian fundamental mode",
    "is matched towards the distribution that creates the field of a circular dipole after refraction by the focusing lens . in the latter case",
    "@xcite the doughnut mode is adapted such that it best overlaps with the field of a linear dipole that has its axis parallel to the optical axis of the parabolic mirror .",
    "finally , in a recent paper the field distribution that maximizes the focal field component parallel to the optical axis of a high na lens is directly calculated by a variational method @xcite . however , with the exemption of ref .",
    "@xcite no direct and explicit relation between the found optimal radiation modes at the input and a dipole radiation pattern is given in these publications .",
    "based on earlier results obtained by others @xcite we follow a different approach in what follows here . knowing that it is only electric dipole radiation that contributes to the focal electric field ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we calculate the distribution of the field incident onto the focusing device that gives the desired dipole radiation pattern after reflection / refraction by the focusing optics , as it was done for a parabolic mirror and linear dipole radiation in ref .",
    "this approach is on the one hand the most direct one . on the other hand ,",
    "it is conceptually simple in comparison to other methods . besides temporal / spectral issues not treated here ,",
    "this ansatz is the same as the time reversal argument given in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for time reversal focusing of microwaves and ref .",
    "@xcite for acoustic waves ) .    some of the results obtained here can in parts also be found in other publications @xcite .",
    "however , a comprehensive study that covers all practically relevant cases is still lacking .",
    "therefore , this paper is intended to deliver a recipe for maximizing the electric field in focusing applications , in particular the excitation of single atoms as envisaged in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will emphasize the importance of a large solid angle of illumination . in secs .",
    "[ sec : intensity ] and [ sec : polarization ] the optimal intensity and polarization distributions will be derived for the cases of illumination by means of a parabolic mirror , a lens fulfilling the sine condition and an ideal thin lens .",
    "since the experimental realization of these distributions may turn out to be rather involved , the overlap of standard radiation modes with the ideal ones is treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : overlap ] .    unlike in many other publications where the field in the focal region is treated",
    ", the discussion will be restricted to the electric field in the very focal point itself .",
    "for the main applications in mind here  scattering by single atoms or absorption of single photons  this constitutes a well justified restriction , since it is only the field at the location of the atom that matters ( see also ref .",
    "furthermore , this restriction leads to several simple analytical results .",
    "before starting with the calculations , we make some notes on the terminology used in this paper . for the quantum - optical applications mentioned above , the field parallel to an atomic dipole has to be maximized . in these cases ,",
    "the dipole axis is given by the quantization axis of the scenario at hand . in a classical sense ,",
    "the term dipole axis designates the direction from which the polar angle @xmath0 is measured that parameterizes the angular dipole radiation patterns ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : coords ] ) .",
    "however , one may also think of applications in which no particular emitter or source is present at the focus but one wants to maximize the electric field vector that points into a certain direction .",
    "this field vector can be thought of as being parallel to some imagined dipole moment .",
    "thus , we will adopt the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite and often speak of virtual dipoles , i.e. , dipoles that _ would _",
    "produce a certain kind of radiation pattern but are not present in reality .",
    "the term solid angle usually designates the integral over the covered polar angle and the covered azimuthal angle . here",
    ", we use this term in a slightly different context .",
    "it designates the covered solid angle weighted by a certain dipole emission pattern : @xmath1 , with @xmath2 for a linear dipole or @xmath3 for a circular dipole  @xcite , respectively .",
    "thus , the maximum achievable , weighted solid angle is @xmath4 instead of @xmath5 in the usual sense .",
    "we now derive an analytic expression that highlights the influence of the covered solid angle .",
    "the electro - magnetic field can be decomposed into its different multipole components .",
    "this has been exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the field in the focal region for a given input field .",
    "however , since we are only interested in the field at the focus , which we take to coincide with the origin of our coordinate system , we only need to take care of the dipole components .",
    "furthermore , it has already been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that each kind of dipole radiation creates predominantly its respective state of polarization at the focus / origin .",
    "this is exactly true for dipoles oriented along the optical axis of the focusing system .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that one only needs to create the radiation pattern of a single kind of dipole for most practical cases .    in order to calculate the ( time independent ) field in the focus , we use the debye - integral in the form given in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field on the focal sphere for a focal length @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath10 the wavelength of the light to be focused .",
    "furthermore , a term @xmath11 has already been dropped since we treat only the case @xmath12 .",
    "if only a single kind of dipole radiation is incident onto the focus , the field on the focal sphere can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a proportionality factor and @xmath15 is the polarization vector of dipole radiation in the far field with @xmath16 for a linear or circular dipole , respectively .",
    "the polarization vectors in spherical coordinates are given by @xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18\\mathbf{e}_\\vartheta   + [ \\pm i\\cos\\varphi - \\sin\\varphi]\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi)\\ ] ] with @xmath19 being the polar and azimuthal unit vectors .",
    "next , we require that independent of the covered solid angle the power @xmath20 incident onto the focus is a constant ( this would correspond to the case of , e.g. , a single photon that is focussed with lenses of different numerical aperture but always covers the whole lens cross section ) .",
    "the total power radiated through the surface of the focal sphere can be written as @xmath21 where the integration limits are given by the intervals of the azimuthal angle and the polar angle covered by the incident light .",
    "the above expression is solved for @xmath14 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the solid angle weighted by the dipole radiation pattern : @xmath24_{\\vartheta_1}^{\\vartheta_2 } \\cdot ( \\varphi_2-\\varphi_1)\\ ] ] for a linear dipole and @xmath25_{\\vartheta_1}^{\\vartheta_2 } \\cdot ( \\varphi_2-\\varphi_1)\\ ] ] for a circular dipole .    inserting the corresponding polarization vector @xmath15 and the factor @xmath14 into eq .",
    "[ eq : debye ] and performing the integration for a linear dipole as well as for circular dipoles , one obtains a general relation for the field component parallel to the virtual dipole : @xmath26 this emphasizes that in order to maximize the focal field component parallel to a given virtual dipole one has to ( i ) put as much of the incident power as possible into the corresponding dipole mode and ( ii ) maximize the solid angle covered by the incident radiation .",
    "it should be pointed out that the resulting field strength does not depend on the dipole type .",
    "we note that for full solid angle illumination the field given by eq .",
    "[ eq : focusfield ] delivers exactly the maximum possible electric energy density given by bassett @xcite .",
    "furthermore , eq . [ eq : focusfield ] constitutes the generalization of eqs .",
    "8 and 10 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the case of a linear dipole oriented along the optical axis of an objective obeying the sine condition is treated .",
    "however , the connection to dipole radiation was not established there .",
    "next , we want to derive the ideal radiation patterns incident onto the focusing device which are transformed into a dipole wave that moves towards the focus . for all devices treated here",
    ", we assume that they operate perfectly , i.e. , the wave incident onto the focus is assumed to have a uniform phase after reflection / refraction off the focusing device ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for example , a parabolic mirror might exhibit ( small ) deviations from the perfect parabolic shape .",
    "furthermore , the phase shift upon reflection is different for different angles of incidence .",
    "we presuppose that such effects are compensated for by , e.g. , appropriate correcting elements .",
    "the production of such elements and the measurement of imperfections might turn out to be a challenging but feasible experimental task @xcite .    the method is simply to start with a dipole wave which virtually emerges from the focus and trace it back through the optical element under consideration .",
    "we have chosen to formulate the ideal radiation patterns in terms of irradiances instead of field vectors , since the former quantity is the one usually measured in an experiment .",
    "furthermore , in the derivation of the apodization factors carried out below , energy conservation considerations require the use of irradiances and radiant intensities anyway .",
    "the ideal vectors fields can be constructed from the irradiance patterns and the polarization patterns derived in the next section .",
    "relation of the angles @xmath27 and @xmath0 to the cartesian coordinates : ( a ) dipole / quantization axis ( gray arrow ) parallel to the optical axis ; ( b ) dipole / quantization axis perpendicular to the optical axis . ]",
    "the derivation of the intensity patterns is pursued in the same way as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for a parabolic mirror and a linear dipole oriented parallel to the optical axis of the mirror .",
    "we designate by @xmath27 the angle that is enclosed by the optical axis of the focusing element and the propagation direction of a single ray which hits the optical element at a distance @xmath28 from the optical axis . here , we chose the optical axis to coincide with the @xmath29-axis ( cf .",
    "[ fig : coords ] ) .",
    "energy conservation demands that  @xcite @xmath30 which delivers @xmath31 with @xmath32 being an apodization factor .",
    "@xmath33 is the radiant intensity , i.e. , the light power emitted into an infinitesimal solid angle .",
    "@xmath34 is the irradiance of the incident plane wave , i.e. , the light power incident onto an infinitesimal surface area .    in what follows",
    ", we express the apodization factor as a function of the cartesian coordinates @xmath35 in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis : @xmath36 with @xmath37 . in the case of a parabolic mirror",
    ", @xmath27 is given through the relation @xcite @xmath38 which with the help of some algebra leads to @xmath39 for an aplanatic lens that fulfills the sine condition , i.e. , a lens where the refracted rays of same phase seem to emerge from a spherical surface around the focus , one has @xmath40 resulting in @xmath41 as a third focusing element , we consider an ideal thin lens , i.e. , a lens for which the refracted rays seem to emerge from a plane perpendicular to the optical axis .",
    "a practical realization of such a thin lens would be an idealized diffractive optical lens .",
    "one has @xmath42 which delivers @xmath43    next , for every point @xmath44 in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis we determine @xmath0 .",
    "the radiant intensity along this direction is given by the angular dipole radiation pattern @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a proportionality constant .",
    "finally , @xmath48 is also expressed in terms of @xmath35 and multiplied with the apodization factor @xmath49 yielding the irradiance @xmath50 .     ideal irradiance distributions for dipoles oriented parallel to the optical axis of the focusing device : ( a ) parabolic mirror , ( b ) aplanatic lens fulfilling the sine condition , ( c ) ideal thin lens",
    ". solid ( dashed ) lines denote the irradiance for a linear ( circular ) dipole radiation pattern . ]    if the dipole is oriented parallel to the optical axis , @xmath27 coincides with @xmath0 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : coords]a ) .",
    "hence , the ideal irradiation is rotationally symmetric with respect to the optical axis and the angular dipole emission patterns given above can be written as @xmath51 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "[ eq : angle_pm ] , [ eq : angle_sc ] and [ eq : angle_te ] , respectively , and applying several trigonometric relations one obtains the ideal irradiance distributions .",
    "they are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : para ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : para ] . we have also introduced normalized coordinates @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "all remaining dimensional quantities have been lumped into a proportionality constant @xmath55 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one could calculate the overlaps also in the case of a lens obeying the sine condition .",
    "however , due to the divergence of the ideal irradiance values towards the boundary of the lens aperture the calculation of the overlap with the simple modes discussed above does not appear to be meaningful .",
    "similar arguments apply when the virtual dipole is oriented orthogonal to the optical axis . since the ideal irradiance patterns have no rotational symmetry , the overlaps will always be smaller than their counterparts for the dipole axis being parallel to the optical axis .",
    "we have derived the ideal radiation patterns with which one achieves the maximum possible field strengths for several focusing devices . besides using these radiation patterns , it is of utmost importance to maximize the covered solid angle , as it is shown by eqs .",
    "[ eq : focusfield ] and [ eq : focusfield_ovl ] .",
    "thus , the maximum possible electric field strength is achieved by covering the full solid angle .",
    "also , the maximum possible effect in the interaction of light with single atoms will also only be found for full solid angle coverage , since scattering as well as absorption of photons is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude at the location of the atom  @xcite .",
    "this finding is in contrast to the statements made in other publications , where it was claimed that the power scattered by a single atom is already maximized for half solid angle illumination @xcite . according with the papers of van enk and kimble @xcite , we want to state once more that for optimum interaction of light with single atoms one has to shape the radiation incident onto the atom to resemble an electric dipole wave ."
