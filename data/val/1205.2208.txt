    "high - energy astrophysical phenomena stem from the generation of powerful flows emanating from supernova explosions , gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , from ejections in the environment of black holes or neutron stars that lead to the formation of very strong shocks , at which particle acceleration takes place .",
    "the new developments in these issues , especially for relativistic shocks , are based on the interdependence between the shock structure , the generation of supra - thermal particles and the generation of turbulence .",
    "it is thought , and numerical simulations support that view , that the penetration of supra - thermal particles in the shock precursor generates magnetic turbulence which in turn provides the scattering process needed for particle acceleration through the fermi process .",
    "this successful development , first elaborated for supernova remnants ( snr ) , inspired similar investigations for the termination shock of grbs .",
    "however , in ultra - relativistic shocks , difficulties arise with the transverse magnetic field that places a limitation to particle penetration upstream and that drags particles in the downstream flow and makes shock recrossing difficult .",
    "it turns out that only sufficiently fast micro - turbulence can make the fermi process operative , as demonstrated by recent numerical simulations . following a review of the main observational results on grbs , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , these points are briefly discussed and astrophysical consequences are drawn .",
    "we describe the role relativistic shocks inside relativistic flows , e.g. the internal shocks of the prompt - emission stage of grbs , may play in the generation of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) . noting that the energy required for supplying sub - gzk uhecr is huge compared with the available energy budget",
    ", we also discuss other sources , such as agn and young pulsars , that may contribute to the flux at ultra - high energies , all the more so if the composition is enriched in heavy nuclei , as suggested by recent experimental results .",
    "the first grb was observed by one of the _ vela _ satellites monitoring for the nuclear test ban treaty in 1967 , but the ( unexpected ) astronomical results were not declassified and published for another six years @xcite . for many years",

    "these workers find a baryonic zone - of - exclusion within the jet , which effectively suppresses any baryonic component . for numerical stability",

    "@xcite used the ibis telescope aboard the integral space laboratory to measure the polarization of the prompt gamma - ray emission of the long and bright grb 041219a in the 200800 kev energy band .",
    "they found a variable degree of polarization ranging from less than 4% over the first peak to 43%-25% for the whole second peak .",
    "time - resolved analysis of both peaks indicated a high degree of polarization , and the small average polarization in the first peak can be explained by the rapid variations observed in the polarization angle and degree .",
    "the results by @xcite are consistent with different models for the prompt emission of grbs at these energies , but they favor synchrotron radiation from a relativistic outflow with a magnetic field , which is coherent on an angular size comparable with the angular size of the emitting region .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the polarization measurement of the prompt gamma - ray emission of grb 100826a with the gamma - ray burst polarimeter ( gap ) aboard the small solar - sail demonstrator ikaros .",
    "they detected the change of polarization angle during the prompt emission , and the average polarization degree of 27@xmath10711% .",
    "polarization measurements are a powerful tool to constrain the grb radiation mechanisms and the magnetic field structure in the photon emitting regions .",
    "the relativistic outflows of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are well - studied particle accelerators .",
    "the agn jet phenomenon spans many orders of magnitudes : jets originate on sub - pc scales close to supermassive black holes with typical masses between a few million and a few billion solar masses and can propagate over many hundred kpc to feed giant hot - spot complexes and radio lobes .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of jets is that they dissipate little energy while transporting vast amounts of energy and momentum over large distances .",
    "however , jets are not dissipation - free neither one sub - pc scales nor on kpc - scales : they do accelerate electrons and maybe also protons to high energies .",
    "the high - energy particles interact with magnetic fields , photon fields , and/or ambient matter and make agns some of the brightest extragalactic sources of continuum emission across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "there are many reasons to study particle acceleration in agns : we would like to explain the observed electromagnetic radiation in order to constrain the composition and structure of jets .",
    "the composition and structure constrain the processes of agn accretion and jet formation , acceleration and collimation .",
    "the same studies can enhance our understanding of agn feedback , i.  e.  how agns interact with their hosts and decisively impact their evolution .",
    "studies of agns also allow us to study the particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "a good ( `` microscopic '' ) understanding of the dissipation processes in jets is instrumental for addressing the larger questions mentioned before .    in the following we discuss two particle acceleration sites : the `` blazar zone '' less than a pc away from the supermassive black hole , and jet particle acceleration by kpc - scale jets .",
    "the processes at work in these two well - separated regions have recently received a lot of attention  mainly because of spectacular jet images from the vlba , hst , and chandra , and spectacular multiwavelength observations with the rxte , suzaku , and swift , x - ray , and fermi , h.e.s.s . ,",

    "blazars are sources with jets closely aligned with the line of sight .",
    "the relativistic propagation of the jet plasma and the close alignment of the jet with the line of sight lead to relativistic boosting of the emission .",
    "blazar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) show evidence for two broad peaks  presumably coming from synchrotron and inverse compton emission from the same electron population .",
    "observations of the bl lac mrk 501 revealed emission up to 16 tev @xcite , giving direct proof that agn jets accelerate particles to @xmath108 1 tev energies .",
    "agns may accelerate particles to much higher energies , maybe even to ultra - high energies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , see however @xcite for a detailed discussion of acceleration power in these sources .",
    "two scenarios are commonly invoked to explain the observed emission : ( i ) the jet is initially poynting flux dominated and accelerates particles in magnetic reconnection events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; ( ii ) the jet is either particle energy dominated right from the start , or , it is initially poynting flux dominated and some unknown mechanism converts the energy from poynting flux into bulk motion energy , and the particle dominated jets subsequently accelerate particles at shocks .",
    "blazar studies of particle acceleration benefit from the fact that the broad - band seds oft he sources evolve on short time scales : x - ray and gamma - ray flares with  1 min durations have been reported .",
    "it thus is possible to track the temporal evolution of the particle energy spectra .",

    "these results clearly favor shock acceleration over magnetic reconnection .",
    "the data and theoretical studies ( particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations and instability analyses ) favor mildly relativistic shocks internal to the jets over highly relativistic external shocks : the former have faster downstream plasmas commensurate with the high inferred bulk lorentz factors of the emitting plasma , and are less susceptible to the strong suppression of the formation of upstream scattering centers by even a weak plasma magnetization than their highly relativistic counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "presently two models are commonly invoked to explain the `` second '' x - ray bright component : ( i ) inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons @xcite , ( ii ) a second synchrotron component @xcite .",
    "the first model requires jet plasma moving with large bulk lorentz factors ( @xmath11010 ) at kpc - distances from the central engine .",
    "the relativistic motion boosts the cmb photon energy density in the reference frame of the emitting plasma by a factor of @xmath111 , and the mean photon energy by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "these two effects make it possible to explain the observed x - ray emission with electrons with modest electron lorentz factors on the order of @xmath112  100 .",
    "the second model requires much higher lorentz factors : assuming equipartition magnetic fields , electrons with lorentz factors @xmath113 are needed to explain the x - ray emission .",
    "both models have severe shortcomings .",
    "for example , in the first model the long cooling times of the low-@xmath59 electrons are at odds with the well - defined knotty structure of some x - ray bright jets .",
    "a weakness of the second model is that there is not yet a good explanation for the existence of two distinct electron populations with very different spectral properties .",
    "for lower - power fr - i - type sources like m 87 , cen a , or 3c 31 , the combined radio , optical and x - ray energy spectra are consistent with a synchrotron - origin of the x - ray emission from a single population of electrons . for an equipartition magnetic fields of @xmath114100  @xmath115 g , the x - ray emitting electrons have lorentz factors @xmath113 , and radiative synchrotron cooling times of a few years .",
    "the x - ray emitting electrons thus do not move far from their acceleration sites before they loose their energy , and the x - ray brightness profiles tracks the acceleration of the high - energy electrons .",
    "the diffuse appearance of some jets implies quasi - continuous acceleration .",
    "a few radio galaxy jets have been studied with the hubble space telescope giving not only high - resolution images of the optical brightness but also of the optical polarization .",
    "the magnetic field probed by the optically emitting electrons seems to be aligned parallel to the jet flow for the most part .",
    "however , upstream of the brightness maxima , the field are perpendicular to the jet flow . the radio and optical polarization behavior differs , indicating that the emission at different wavelengths samples different regions of the jet @xcite .",
    "one of the 11 fundamental science questions for the 21st century listed in the final report of the 2002 decadal review @xcite is the nature of cosmic rays .",
    "the detection of cosmic rays at ultra - high energies ( uhecr ) dates back to the early sixties , but only during the last 20 years detectors of sufficiently large size have become operational , that the origin of uhecrs can be addressed .",
    "uhecrs are indirectly detected by observing the airshowers they trigger in the atmosphere .",
    "one can look for fluorescence emission or other radiation produced high in the atmosphere , or , alternatively , one registers the passage of secondary particle in charged - particle detectors on the ground .",
    "the auger observatory @xcite and the telescope array @xcite combine both techniques .",
    "the main observables used to infer the properties of uhecrs are the anisotropy , the composition , and the spectrum .",
    "the composition is difficult to determine , because the appearance of giant airshowers can only be modeled with particle - physics event generators that involve extrapolations of behaviour observed in accelerator experiments , for the com energy of an arbitrary nucleus of 10  eev energy with a nitrogen nucleus at rest is far higher than that achievable with even the largest man - made accelerator , the lhc at cern .",
    "considerable systematic uncertainty thus overshadows attempts to study the composition .",
    "it appears that between 1  pev and 0.1  eev we observe a trend from a predominance of light particles to heavy nuclei . around 1",
    "eev , the composition is light again @xcite . above 1  eev , auger observes a transition to heavier particles that is not see with other experiments at this time , possibly on account of statistics .",
    "the anisotropy is low around 1  eev , where upper limits near 1% have been published for the sidereal dipole anisotropy @xcite . at higher energies above 57 eev , for which little deflection would be expected ,",
    "if the primary particles were protons , a correlation is observed between the arrival direction of particles and certain types of nearby agn which in the end are proxies of the matter distribution within @xmath075 mpc from us @xcite .",
    "the distance limitation is expected because nuclei at these energies undergo photodisintegration and photomeson production that provide losses on corresponding time scales , leading to the so - called gzk cut off .    whereas cosmic rays approximately obey a power - law spectrum with index @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) below the so - called knee in the spectrum at 3 pev , the spectrum of uhecrs is soft between a few pev and 3  eev with a power - law index @xmath118 @xcite . at 3",
    "eev the spectrum hardens to @xmath119 , a feature known as the ankle . above 30",
    "eev one observes a flux suppression that has been identified with the gzk cut off @xcite a recent proposal @xcite interprets those features as a proton cut off around @xmath120 and another one around @xmath121 associated with iron nuclei .",
    "cosmic rays at energies below 1 pev are almost certainly galactic in origin , and those at energies above 10 eev are most likely extragalactic , but considerable uncertainty exists at intermediate energies .",
    "it is unclear at what energy the local cosmic rays turn from being predominantly galactic to being mostly extragalactic .",
    "the relevance of this uncertainty for modeling the sources of cosmic rays is obvious : if the particles in the energy band above the knee at a few pev , or above the iron knee at @xmath122  ev , are extragalactic , then considerable finetuning is required in matching the galactic and extragalactic components , because the spectrum softens at the knee .",
    "on the other hand , if cosmic rays up to a few eev , i.e. up to the ankle in the spectrum , are galactic , then no such finetuning is required , but we need to identify the sources of eev - band cosmic rays with objects present in the galaxy , e.g. supernova remnants ( snr ) , pulsars , etc .",
    "this can be difficult , not because the source in question would not accelerate particles to high energies , which in fact we observe happening in snr and pulsars , but because it is questionable that eev energies can be reached .",
    "in fact , for typical interstellar magnetic field values , snr shock fronts can hardly accelerate cosmic rays to a pev @xcite .",
    "particle confinement near the shock is supported by self - generated magnetic turbulence ahead of and behind the shock .",
    "various plasma instabilities driven by cosmic rays can contribute to excite the turbulence to high levels , although which dominates remains an active topic of research .",
    "in the case of snrs , that which has received most attention so far is the so - called streaming instability seeded by the cosmic - ray net current ( * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , relativistic shocks operating at the interface between agn / grb flows and the surrounding medium reveal a short precursor , which restricts the plasma instabilities to small scale modes @xcite , as discussed in detail in the following .",
    "clearly , the amplitude of the turbulence sets up the pitch - angle scattering frequency and thus the acceleration rate @xcite .",
    "in addition , it also sets the scale for the maximum energy , to which a remnant may accelerate particles .",
    "although analytical and numerical estimates suggest that cosmic rays can very efficiently drive magnetic turbulence ahead of the shock ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) , so the turbulent magnetic field may be much larger than the homogeneous interstellar field @xcite , large increases in the magnetic field strength do not necessarily translate into a significant increase in the maximum particle energy @xcite .    for relativistic sources such as agn or grb , relativistic shock acceleration can be invoked , but even there certain limitations arise ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "to be shock accelerated , a particle that has crossed the shock toward the upstream must be overtaken again by the shock .",
    "assuming the shock moves at lorentz factor @xmath123 , the particle must have been deflected ( by gyration or scattering ) through an angle @xmath124 while residing upstream .",
    "this deflection must be accomplished within a time @xmath125 at least of order @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the shock radius at which the shock once again overtakes the particle .",
    "the factor @xmath128 in @xmath129 arises for subrelativistic shocks on account of the small incremental energy gain per shock crossing .",
    "the particle must cross the shock @xmath130 times to double its energy , with each crossing requiring at least a significant fraction of a gyroperiod .",
    "the fastest possible deflection is provided by undisturbed gyration in magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the shock normal , for which the angle between particle momentum and shock normal , @xmath131 , increases linearly with time , and the deflection rate @xmath132 must then obey @xmath133 .",
    "this inequality sets a maximum energy @xmath134 to which a particle can be accelerated , because the rate of change of angle presumably decreases with particle energy . as @xmath135 ,",
    "this corresponds to a maximum energy , in the limit of relativistic particles , of @xmath136 such regular deflection only occurs in a magnetic field that is coherent over scales larger than the path length of the particle . in the short precursor of a relativistic shock , this restricts @xmath137 to the background , undisturbed magnetic - field value , and it thus limits the maximal energy to a rather small value for typical interstellar - medium conditions . to be noted",
    "is that equation  [ emax1 ] may provide a rather academic limit , because in a relativistic shock a perpendicular magnetic field in the downstream region renders acceleration very inefficient .",
    "also note that the magnetic - field strength , @xmath137 , is supposed to be measured in the upstream frame of the shock , i.e. it is the ambient field in the source frame in , e.g. , an extrenal shock of a grb .",
    "note that scatter - free gyration can not in general confine a cr particle to a subrelativistic blast wave in all three dimensions .",
    "the particle generally drifts off to the side after gaining the potential difference @xmath138 in energy .",
    "some scattering is required which will reduce @xmath134 .",
    "also note that we have neglected both adiabatic losses and drift to the periphery of the shock front and assumed that being overtaken by a spherical blast wave is sufficient for further acceleration .",
    "for relativistic shocks , escape through the lateral boundaries does not provide a stringent constraint on the maximal acceleration energy unless sideways expansion of the blast takes place : as viewed in the shock front rest frame , the particle is confined if its gyration radius @xmath139 , with @xmath140 the lateral extension of the shock front . since @xmath141 , with @xmath142 the upstream gyroradius in the background field , confinement leads to @xmath143 , which is not as restrictive as the previous expression if @xmath144 .",
    "in that limit , sideways expansion of the blast is negligible and the overall dynamics resembles that of a spherical blast wave .    what of often invoked magnetic - field amplification by cosmic - ray induced instabilities ?",
    "the growth of plasma instabilities in the precursors of shocks is inevitable , and therefore in a realistic situation we can not expect undisturbed gyration in perpendicular magnetic - field .",
    "in fact , random scattering is required if the large - scale magnetic field is oriented parallel to the shock , because otherwise particles could not return to the shock .",
    "therefore , random scattering in small - scale fields will make acceleration at parallel shocks faster , and thereby increase the maximum energy , in particular at nonrelativistic shocks .",
    "the scattering mean free path can be written as @xmath145 , where the angular diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the scattering coherence time , over which the particle scatters by an angle @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the coherence length of the magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", one must now impose @xmath150 , with @xmath151 .",
    "for relativistic shocks , the condition for the particle to suffer a rms deflection @xmath152 over a timescale @xmath153 reads @xmath154 , so that these two equations can be combined into @xmath155 which is less than the previous expression when @xmath156 .",
    "such small - scale fields are expected in the precursor of relativistic shocks , which can not exceed @xmath157 , although there is then an ambiguity related to the reference frame of the small - scale magnetic inhomogeneities ; for simplicity , we have assumed here that these magnetic inhomogeneities are at rest in the upstream plasma .",
    "thus , provided some large - scale perpendicular magnetic field exists , simply tangling the field on small scales , @xmath149 , does not necessarily raise @xmath134 .",
    "magnetic - field amplification enhances the maximum energy only if it increases @xmath158 .",

    "we stress again that the limits described here may not be reached at a real shock .",
    "leakage from the precursor and the conditions downstream must also be considered when evaluating the maximum energy and the acceleration efficiency .",
    "equations  [ emax1 ] and [ emax2 ] suggest that the sources of uhecrs are likely systems involving relatistic shocks .      besides reaching the required particle energy , the sources of uhecr must also be powerful enough to provide the source luminosity needed to sustain the local flux of uhecr .",
    "possible source candidates of uhecrs are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , clusters of galaxies @xcite , magnetars @xcite , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "depending on the model , these sources may also dominate the energy range around @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "one can constrain the acceleration capabilities of various sources through the magnetic luminosity of these sources  ( * ? ? ?",

    "let us assume that acceleration takes place in an outflow at radius @xmath163 moving with possibly relativistic velocity @xmath164 ( and lorentz factor @xmath42 ) towards the observer , so as to benefit from lorentz boosting .",
    "we assume that acceleration proceeds with an acceleration timescale @xmath165 in the comoving frame , with @xmath166 .",
    "then the maximal energy at acceleration is at least bounded by the condition @xmath167 , which means that the acceleration timescale must be shorter than the comoving age of the outflow .",
    "this limit can be rewritten in terms of the maximal energy in the observer frame , @xmath134 and in terms of the magnetic luminosity of the source , @xmath168 as calculated in the source rest frame in terms of the jet half opening angle @xmath169 and comoving magnetic - field strength @xmath137 : @xmath170 with @xmath171erg / s .",
    "one can check that this bound remains robust in the small @xmath169 limit , meaning @xmath172 for which side escape becomes important , and in the small @xmath164 limit .",
    "this bound indicates that rather extraordinary luminosities are required to accelerate particles to ultra - high energies , under rather general conditions , although the bound depends on the charge of the particle .",
    "for instance , if one derives the magnetic luminosity of blazars through a leptonic modelling of the spectral energy distributions , one concludes that only the rare flat spectrum radio quasars with jet powers @xmath173  erg / s can accelerate protons to @xmath174ev , while other bl lac and tev blazars ( fr  i analogs ) with jet powers @xmath175  erg / s appear limited to @xmath176ev @xcite . from this point of view ,",
    "more compact sources such as grbs and magnetars appear favored .",
    "for instance , a grb of apparent isotropic luminosity @xmath177erg / s with @xmath178 may produce particles with energy as high as @xmath179  ev for a magnetic conversion factor @xmath180 . as discussed in sec.[sec : acc ] , mildly or sub - relativistic shocks in a relativistic flow are more efficient accelerators of protons than ultra - relativistic shocks and are excellent candidates for being sources of uhecrs , owing to the magnetic - field amplification at shocks .",
    "the paucity of fr  2 radio - galaxies in the gzk sphere ( radius @xmath181mpc ) capable of accelerating protons to ultra - high energies might be compensated by the acceleration of heavier nuclei in the less powerful and more numerous fr  i radio - galaxies .",
    "in particular , ptuskin and collaborators have shown that if radio - galaxies inject of light to heavy elements with a rigidity dependent maximal energy following eq .",
    "( [ eq : lb ] ) , @xmath182 being related to the radio luminosity , accounting for the radio - luminosity function , one could explain rather satisfactorily the observed spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is also intriguing that the pierre auger observatory reports an excess of events in the direction of the nearby radio - galaxy cen  a ( although this latter happens to lie in front of one of the largest concentrations of matter in the gzk sphere , the centaurus supercluster ) .",
    "however , it would be very difficult to understand the observed pattern of anisotropy if one assumes that the highest energy particles are heavier than hydrogen in such scenarios @xcite .",
    "besides the actual source physics , the evolution of sources , the number of accelerators within a source @xcite , and the variation of source properties @xcite will also shape the local spectrum of uhecrs .",
    "many properties of uhecrs can be impacted by their propagation in intergalactic space , such as their composition through photo - desintegration or their spectrum through cascading via photo - meson and photo - pair production , but it is difficult to disentangle the propagation effects from the results of physical processes operating inside the sources of these particles .    estimating the source luminosity using observed quantities and the known population statistics of the sources in question is subject to considerable uncertainties . as an example , @xcite have recently estimated the local uhecr source luminosity , assuming all particles above the ankle at 4 eev are extragalactic , and compared that with the observed gamma - ray production rate of all grb .",
    "in contrast to earlier studies @xcite , not the mev - band gamma - ray fluence was used , which likely represents a thermal pool , but the gev - band emission observed with fermi - lat , which measures the non - thermal tail of the energy distribution in the grb primary charged particles , which , if hadronic , is the part that could contribute to the uhecr flux .",
    "it turns out that the uhecr source luminosity is more than a hundred times higher than the total gev - band photon output , which places severe constraints on uhecr models involving grb .",
    "if one posits that the galactic to extra - galactic transition takes place at @xmath183ev and the mev gamma - ray fluence traces the nonthermal particle population , the particle output of grbs is more commensurate with their photon output @xcite .    for each source class , one can also estimate a luminosity function , that is the differential source density needed to integrate the contribution of the sources over cosmological redshift . while only nearby ( @xmath184  mpc ) sources may actually contribute to locally observable gzk - scale uhecrs , the interaction products of the particles from all more distant sources will feed a cascade of energy that is eventually observable as a component of the extragalactic gamma - ray and neutrino background , which are two other cosmic messengers that are complementary to the charged particles .",
    "the former has been recently measured with unprecedented sensitivity up to 100  gev @xcite , and thus provides invaluable constraints on , e.g. , the so - called dip models , which assume that essentially all particle above about 1  eev are protons .",
    "the redshift of the onset of photopair production with the cmb would then naturally lead to an ankle at the energy where it is indeed observed @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it is the cosmic evolution of the source class in question that determines how much energy is fed into an electromagnetic cascade and eventually reappears in the gev - band background radiation , relative to the uhecr energy flux at the ankle .",
    "an open problem in cosmic - ray astrophysics is at what energy we observe the transition from a galactic to an extragalactic origin of particles .",
    "the limit on inferred source power per unit baryon mass required to sustain galactic uhecr in the [ 4 - 40 ] eev range that is imposed by the observed anisotropy limits is smaller by nearly 3 orders of magnitude than what is required for an extragalactic origin , as calculated in @xcite , and it corresponds to the power per unit mass of gamma rays from grb @xcite .",
    "this is not only confirmation of the hypothesis that uhecr beyond the ankle are extragalactic , it also suggest that their sources are systems not persistently present in the galaxy . any astrophysical source class ,",
    "that is capable of accelerating particles to very high energies and should exist in the galaxy , may fall short of accounting for the trans - ankle uhecr , but may nevertheless significantly contribute to the observed cosmic - ray flux between the knee and the ankle .",
    "for example , the numerical coincidence fits the hypothesis of a grb origin for the galactic component of uhecr , without invoking a much larger unseen energy reservoir for grb .",
    "the interesting question is the rate with which such sources appear in normal galaxies such as the milky way . in other words ,",
    "what is the role of intermittency ?",
    "generally , grbs in the galaxy are expected every million years or so , the exact rate depending on the beaming fraction and the detailed scaling of long grb with star formation and metallicity",
    ". therefore , only a small number of grb can contribute to the particle flux at the solar circle , and their relative contribution depends on the location and explosion time of the grb .",
    "variations in the local particle flux must be expected , and neither the particle spectrum from an individual grb nor the spectrum calculated for a homogeneous source distribution are good proxies .",
    "@xcite have calculated the time - dependent transport of uhecr in the galaxy , assuming it can be described as isotropic diffusion .",
    "they find that intermittency becomes serious if the mean free path for scattering exceeds 100  pc , unless the source rate is much higher than 1 per myr . on average ,",
    "galactic long grb need to contribute only about @xmath185  erg / s in accelerated particles to fully account for the observed particle flux at @xmath186  ev , assuming a bohmian mean free path at this energy .",
    "uhecr from galactic long grb can meet the observational limits on anisotropy only if the mean free path for scattering is sufficiently small .",
    "contributing the observed sub - ankle particles ( at @xmath186  ev ) requires bohmian diffusion if the uhecr are as heavy as carbon . a light composition such as protons or helium requires sub - bohmian diffusion , which is a highly unlikely situation for isotropic diffusion .",
    "much of the uhecr anisotropy arises from the expected location of long grb in the inner galaxy .",
    "observations of grb host galaxies suggest that regions of low metallicity and active star formation may be the preferred sites of long grb @xcite , which may skew the galactocentric distribution of long grb toward the outer galaxy .",
    "as there is no power problem with galactic grb , it may be worthwhile to also consider short grb .",
    "they provide supposedly less power as a population , but they may have a very extended spatial distribution in the galaxy @xcite , leading to a reduced , but on account of intermittency not disappearing anisotropy .",
    "these conclusions can be applied with little change to the case of an origin of uhecrs in snrs , assuming very efficient magnetic - field amplification can increase their ability to accelerate particles to energies significantly higher than @xmath187  pev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spatial distribution in the galaxy of long grb and snr can be expected to be similar , and therefore the average anisotropy is the same for both long grb and snr .",
    "if one combines such a galactic component with a dip model , so that the galactic / extragalactic transition occurs below 1 eev , bohm diffusion and a mixed composition of the galactic component may still be viable , given the systematic uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "it would be highly desirable to improve anisotropy measurement between 0.1  eev and 1  eev , and likewise better constrain the composition .",
    "recent progress in uhecr research has built on data from new large - scale observatories .",
    "the interpretation of measurements of the composition , anisotropy , and spectrum of particles provides constraining links between these observables , that are further strengthened by new precision measurement of , e.g. , extragalactic gamma - ray background emission .",
    "the very low anisotropy observed for eev - scale particles provides a strong limit on the contribution of galactic sources , if the composition is indeed light as suggested by data .",
    "the anisotropy found above 60 eev would be difficult to understand if the particles were heavy , which is suggested by auger data , but not hires .",
    "if these particles were light , dip models might be favorable which , however , must be carefully constructed to not overproduce the 50-gev - scale gamma - ray background .    the main obstacle to further progress clearly is the systematic uncertainty arising from the interpretation of the evolution of giant airshowers with particle - physics models that are extrapolated over at least 1.5 decades in com energy from the range teastable with manmade accelerator experiments .",
    "strong shocks occurring in astrophysical flows often generate power - law distributions of very - high - energy particles .",
    "this is the origin of most high - energy phenomena in astrophysics .",
    "the favored mechanism for the generation of supra - thermal particles is the famous fermi process .",
    "it involves with the scattering of high - energy particles off magnetic disturbances that allow them to cross the shock back and forth and thus to gain energy .",
    "many studies have been performed in the 80-ties and 90-ties by assuming pre - existing magnetic turbulence .",
    "however , it turns out that the pre - existing turbulence is generally not strong enough to account for the acceleration performance . the nonthermal x - ray emission from snrs @xcite , but see also @xcite , revealed that the magnetic field is strongly amplified in the vicinity of the forward shock .",
    "recent theoretical studies have shown that the penetration of accelerated particles in the shock upstream flow can generate magnetic turbulence that reaches a level much larger than the intensity of the ambient mean field @xcite . in producing turbulence the cosmic rays loose a fraction of its global energy ( about 10 percent of the incoming energy ) but increases the maximum energy of particles ( cf .",
    "section [ ssec : maxe ] ) . the turbulent field can reach an intensity of a few hundreds of @xmath115 g , much larger than the value of a few @xmath115 g of the ambient magnetic field in the galaxy .",
    "these results incited similar investigations for relativistic shocks .",
    "very encouraging results were obtained around the turn of the century which extended the theory of fermi process to the case of relativistic shocks and predicted the formation of a power - law energy spectrum with an index @xmath188 and an acceleration time as fast as the larmor time @xcite .",
    "but disappointment came once the effect of the ambient magnetic field had been taken into account , because it inhibits the fermi process even when one considers a strong kolmogorov turbulence @xcite .    in the following",
    ", it will be shown how the paradigm of the three interdependent aspects of collisionless - shock physics successfully works in the absence of any mean field : structure with a partial reflection on a barrier , supra - thermal - particle generation , magnetic - turbulence generation .",
    "then the scattering issue in the presence of a mean magnetic field will be addressed and the requirement for circumventing the inhibition effect will be stated .",
    "then an unusual fact in astrophysics will be emphasized , namely the necessity of considering some unavoidable micro - physics , that turns out to be crucial not only for the relativistic shock formation but also for making the fermi process operative and producing high energy particles .",
    "the most favored process for the generation of supra - thermal power law distributions is the fermi process at shocks . under astrophysical conditions the plasma flow that experiences a shock",
    "is supposed to carry a frozen - in turbulent magnetic field which allows particle scattering , and thereby permits particles to gain energy at each fermi cycle , i.e. a cycle upstream - downstream - upstream or downstream - upstream - downstream .    at a non - relativistic shock of speed @xmath189 ,",
    "the average gain per cycle is small , @xmath190 ( where @xmath163 is the compression ratio , that reaches the value 4 when the shock is adiabatic and strong ) .",
    "however this is compensated by a large number of shock crossings ; indeed the escape probability ( i.e. the probability for a particle to be entrained by the downstream flow and to not come back to the shock front ) is low , @xmath191 ; the return probability @xmath192 is thus large .",
    "a power - law distribution of energy is set up with an index that is a simple function of the compression ratio , in the non - relativistic case : @xmath193 strong adiabatic shocks provide a particle spectrum with an universal index , @xmath194 , which is modified by losses , radiation losses for the electrons , expansion or escape for protons .",
    "subsequent to escape , the spectrum is then steepened by the effect of diffusive propagation and escape of particles from the galaxy .",
    "the successive fermi cycles produce a precursor of supra - thermal particles ( mostly protons ) of large extension ( the diffusion length increases with the particle energy ) and this penetration in the upstream medium ( the ambient medium for an external shock ) triggers mhd turbulence through two types of streaming instability , one is resonant and has been considered for many years , the other is non - resonant and has been considered more recently @xcite , as briefly discussed earlier .",
    "that latter case is quite interesting , first because it is a simple and robust mechanism based on the supplementary lorentz force associated with the plasma current that compensates the cosmic - ray current , second because it leads to a turbulent field of large intensity ; indeed this latter can become much larger than the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the theory indicates that the fraction of incoming energy flux converted into magnetic energy can reach @xmath196 , which is a few percent in snrs , where one defines @xmath197 a very important remark is that the efficiency of the fermi process depends on the efficiency of the scattering process . by the way",
    ", the mechanism of fermi acceleration is a simple process , but the scattering , that controls the efficiency of the acceleration process , is the main issue .        as for relativistic shocks , there are similarities and some differences with the non - relativistic ones , as summarized in table 1",
    ". there are strong arguments that there is a significant generation of magnetic turbulence at the external shock of a grb @xcite and there is an obvious power - law distribution of ultra - relativistic electrons that synchrotron radiate , with an index compatible with the theory of the fermi process at ultra - relativistic shocks ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "the ambient magnetic field is very low and at first approximation can be neglected .",
    "a remarkable work was published by @xcite that fully validates the paradigm , combining three fundamental processes : the formation of a collisionless relativistic shock front with reflected particles , the generation of magnetic turbulence and the generation of a power - law distribution through the fermi process .",
    "this is a pic ( particles in cell ) simulation of the development of a collisionless shock in a pair plasma ( electrons and positrons ) that runs with a lorentz factor @xmath161 of a few tens ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "the flow of reflected particles interacts with the flow of passing particles leading to streaming - type instabilities , and the weibel branch of instability describes the formation of intense small - scale magnetic filaments .",
    "the relevant scale of the physics is the inertial length ( or skin depth ) @xmath200 .",
    "the spatial growth of the magnetic micro - turbulence produces a partial reflection of the incoming particles , which allows the formation of a shock front , and self - consistently , the reflected particles generate the required level of micro - turbulence .",
    "similarly as the non - relativistic case , conversion parameters @xmath201 can be defined in the ultra - relativistic case : @xmath202 and the simulations indicate that @xmath203 and @xmath204 , similarly to the non - relativistic case . the supra - thermal spectrum obtained in the simulation is close to the theoretical prediction with an index @xmath205 .",
    "similar results were obtained later with pic simulation involving a plasma of electrons and ions of @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "many astrophysical shocks form in a plasma having a significant magnetization .",
    "the physics becomes more complex with a finite ambient mean field ; it is controlled by the important `` magnetization '' parameter @xmath34 : @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the field measured in the upstream flow frame ( generally the ambient field ) , and @xmath209 is the transverse component of the mean field measured in the shock frame .",
    "like in non - relativistic shocks , the angle of the field lines with respect to the shock normal is very important .",
    "but whereas most non - relativistic shocks are in the so - called `` sub - luminal '' configuration , i.e. that the angle @xmath210 is not too close to @xmath211 and thus particles can flow along the field lines , in ultra - relativistic shocks , it suffices that the field angle @xmath210 be larger than @xmath212 to prevent the return of particles to the upstream region .",
    "a generic ultra - relativistic shock is thus `` supra - luminal '' , and the magnetic field in the front frame can be considered as almost perpendicular , because its transverse component is amplified by a factor @xmath161 .",
    "this field orientation is a serious hindrance for the development of fermi cycles . neglecting for the time being any scattering process in a putative turbulence superimposed on the background field ,",
    "the particle kinematics can be described as follows .",
    "a particle that enters the downstream flow of speed @xmath213 is dragged by the frozen in magnetic field and can not easily come back upstream ; it can be shown that it can come back just one time @xcite .",
    "once upstream , it eventually comes back downstream , but in a subset of phase space that does not allow it to make a second cycle .",
    "now , it might be thought that a strong turbulence could provide efficient scattering allowing it to make several cycles .",
    "however , the typical interstellar turbulent field with a large - scale coherence length behaves like an ordered magnetic field for such particles , because their penetration length upstream ( @xmath214 , measured in the co - moving upstream frame ) is much shorter than the coherence length of turbulence @xcite . in self - generated small scale turbulence",
    ", scattering might be efficient enough to trigger fermi acceleration , see below .",
    "the coherence length @xmath215 is formally defined as the range of the field correlation using the self - correlation function , @xmath216 . for an isotropic turbulent state we can write ( it can easily be properly modified in the case of anisotropic turbulence ) :",
    "@xmath217 which can be expressed as an integral over the turbulence spectrum , and one finds that for a spectrum proportional to @xmath218 , the correlation length corresponds to large wavelengths for @xmath219 , as is the case of a kolmogorov spectrum ; for @xmath220 , the coherence length is in the shortest - wavelengths part of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the expected duration of the cycle would be much shorter than the eddy turn - over time of large - scale vortices .",
    "the requirements for efficient scattering off magnetic turbulence are quite challenging @xcite , for not only the intensity of the turbulent field must be much larger than the mean field , but also the coherence length must be shorter than a larmor radius . when a scattering process develops , phase space is opened for operating a fermi process if the scattering frequency is larger than the larmor pulsation in the mean field .",
    "short - scale turbulence leads to a scattering frequency @xmath221 , whereas the larmor pulsation @xmath222 ; thus the range of particle energies for which the phase space is unlocked and fermi process operative , is such that @xmath223 .    at high magnetization ( say @xmath224 )",
    "the shock is formed by generation of an intense coherent wave through a synchrotron maser instability due to a resonance with the loop of reflected particles @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic wave propagating downstream is damped by synchrotron resonance and produces a thermal distribution .",
    "the wave propagating upstream carries away a fraction @xmath225 of the incoming energy in the case of an @xmath226-plasma ; in a @xmath227-plasma , an electrostatic wake field is generated that heats the electrons up to equipartition while slowing down protons @xcite .",
    "the formation of a power - law distribution @xcite has not been confirmed as far as we know .",
    "the final word has not been given on these issues of course , because the simulations have been conducted so far in 1d @xcite or 2d @xcite over a limited amount of time .",
    "what happens in a more realistic 3d simulation , the dimensionality of which should allow more efficient cross - field transport , or on longer timescales , remain to be seen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite , at lower magnetization , nothing happens except the thermalization of protons ( @xmath228 ) , until the magnetization reaches a very low critical value at which the fermi process starts . as the magnetization decreases , indeed the precursor length scale increases , to the point where plasma microinstabilities triggered by the suprathermal particle population self - generate a small scale turbulence that can sustain the fermi process ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 ) .",
    "actually , one needs a very low magnetic field to obtain an upstream penetration length of supra - thermal particles large enough for having a significant interaction of those particles with the incoming plasma and having a growth of micro - instabilities .",
    "the fermi process works with the magnetic component of micro - turbulence at the inertial scale @xmath229 . in principle",
    "it starts at even smaller scale , the inertial scale of electrons , however electrons are efficiently heated by the electric component of micro - turbulence and then the precursor becomes composed of electrons and protons of similar relativistic mass , like a pair plasma .",
    "this is a very interesting outcome that simplifies the physics which rapidly evolves towards conditions similar to those occurring in a pair plasma .",
    "thus the pic simulations of pair plasma are also valuable to understand the physics of shocks in electron - proton plasmas . then a distribution function displaying a thermal part and a supra - thermal part with a power law is obtained .",
    "the transition towards the fermi process is determined by the micro - instabilities that can grow when the upstream penetration of reflected particles is long enough .",
    "the fastest instabilities ( buneman instability , oblique two - stream instability , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seem to essentially pre - heat the incoming electrons almost up to equipartition with protons .",
    "however , more simulations are necessary to clarify this important point .",
    "the generation of magnetic micro - turbulence by the weibel instability , which is also studied in laboratory experiments , is thought to be the main ingredient to form collisionless shocks and to produce the fermi process ; however this is also under study by pic simulations .",
    "the generation of magnetic micro - turbulence occurs when the magnetization parameter falls below the following critical value @xcite , as confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite : @xmath230 numerical simulations show that the level reached by that weibel turbulence is such that @xmath231 , which insures shock formation and fermi process .",
    "then there exists a large energy range for particle scattering when @xmath232 .",
    "the main issue with fermi processes based on the scattering off micro - turbulence is that the scattering frequency decreases as @xmath233 .",
    "the performance of fermi processes at non - relativistic shocks is determined by the scattering off large - scale , say kolmogorov , turbulence which is fairly slow ( much slower than the larmor pulsation in the mean field ) but decreases only as @xmath234 .",
    "thus , if we compare the fermi process at relativistic shocks with the process at non - relativistic shock , this is like the hare and the tortoise : the scattering , and thus the acceleration rhythm , at relativistic shocks is very fast at low energy and decreases rapidly as energy increases , whereas , at non - relativistic shocks , it is slow at low energy but continues at higher energies with a moderate decline of its efficiency .      the external shock that drives the afterglow emission of grbs may give rise to an efficient acceleration of electrons if the external medium is weakly magnetized , for the reasons discussed previously . if electrons thermalize with protons ( as reasonably expected ) ,",
    "their temperature is already very high at the beginning of the afterglow : @xmath235 , which corresponds to a few tens of gev .",
    "intense short - scale magnetic turbulence develops because the interstellar magnetization parameter is very low , @xmath236 , whereas the critical value @xmath237 , with @xmath238 .",
    "what kind of radiation can be expected in such small - scale field , much more intense than the mean field ?",
    "this depends on a so - called  wiggler \" parameter @xmath239 : @xmath240 this parameter measures the capability of the magnetic force to deflect a relativistic electron of lorentz factor @xmath59 by an angle @xmath241 ( which is the reason why @xmath59 does not appear in the definition ) . if @xmath242 , then the magnetic field produces a single deflection of the electron in the emission cone of half angle @xmath243 , whereas if @xmath244 the electron can undergo several wiggles in the emission cone .",
    "when @xmath239 is large , the emission behaves like normal synchrotron radiation in a mean field , except that there is no polarization .",
    "when @xmath239 is small , the emission is of  jitter \" type @xcite .",
    "thus the emission caused by shocked and accelerated electrons at a relativistic shock is ",
    "synchrotron - like \" , and the analysis of the emitted spectrum provides a diagnostic of the magnetic turbulence .",
    "it is quite remarkable that there exists an almost universal energy limit for the electron radiating in the intense small scale field ( in agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath245 the corresponding maximum energy for the photons emitted inthe quasi - homogeneous field is @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the fine structure constant . the account for magnetic fluctuations of scales larger than the synchrotron emission formation length results in the photon spectra extended beyond the limit given by eq.([emax ] ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus a single synchrotron - like spectrum extending up to several gev , even possibly a few tens , can be expected and is in fact compatible with observations .",
    "so the performance of relativistic shocks for electron acceleration and radiation appears very satisfactory .",
    "the conversion factor into radiation is @xmath248 , and at the beginning of the afterglow @xmath249 .",
    "protons are expected to be accelerated at least as efficiently as electrons at ultra - relativistic shock waves . however ,",
    "as mentioned previously , the ultra - relativistic fermi process appears unable to push protons up to energies in excess of @xmath250ev , because the scattering time and thus the acceleration time increase with @xmath251 in the self - generated turbulent field , or scale with @xmath252 , but then in the background unamplified field .",
    "using one or the other , one does not find numbers significantly different from the limit associated to the mean field discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : maxe ] ( eq .  [ emax1 ] ) : @xmath253 .",
    "thus , although an energy of order @xmath254  ev is achieved , which is something , the result is far from reaching the uhe - range .",
    "precise performances of mildly or sub - relativistic shocks are not yet known and require more numerical simulations . however , some reasonable estimates are permitted by extrapolating what we know about the two extremes : non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic shocks .",
    "the main guess is that we can expect a magnetic - field amplification at shocks with a conversion factor @xmath231 , occurring in mhd regime without severe limitation due to the super - luminal configuration , especially for oblique internal shocks ( termination shocks in the hot spots of fr2 jets might be super - luminal ) .",
    "these assumptions can be applied to internal shocks of agn jets ( in particular in blazars jets ) , and to internal shocks of grbs , as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : uhecr ] .      the triangular dependence of collisionless shock structure with a reflecting barrier for a part of incoming particles , with generation of supra - thermal particles and the generation of magnetic turbulence is a successful paradigm that applies to astrophysical shocks , both non - relativistic and relativistic .",
    "numerical and theoretical works are making significant progress for both understanding the physics and providing quantitative results useful for astrophysical investigations .",
    "this includes not only the spectral index and cut off of the distribution of accelerated particles , but also the efficiency factors for the conversion into cosmic rays , magnetic turbulence and radiation .",
    "we have seen only the beginning of this line of study , which requires more pic simulations and new types of hybrid codes involving relativistic mhd coupled with pic codes for cosmic rays .",
    "the new results that have already been obtained are important .",
    "first , the strong amplification of the magnetic field at snrs received theoretical and numerical support ; the astrophysical consequences are interesting , especially for our understanding of the galactic contribution of the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "secondly , current state - of - the - art pic simulations indicate that the fermi process does not operate at ultra - relativistic shocks with magnetization of order unity , which is supposed to be a frequent situation in high - energy astrophysics , as for instance in fr2 hot spots , in blazars , in pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "such simulations need however to be extended both to higher dimensionality and to larger space - time domains before a definite conclusion can be reached . in particular , the issue of the non stationarity and/or corrugation of the shock front in relativistic regime should be investigated . also",
    "the role of magnetic reconnections in the shock vicinity is a very important new topic whose investigation is just starting . whether and how acceleration proceeds in the mildly - relativistic regime also remains open for study .",
    "thirdly the radiation processes that operate in most high - energy astrophysical sources involve relativistic electrons scattered in an intense short - scale magnetic turbulence ; this leads to a renewed interest in the radiation physics with a view to use it as a diagnostic of the magnetic turbulent state .",
    "the new trend in these topics is the important role imputed to micro - physics phenomena , which have a direct astrophysical impact .",
    "these developments incite interest in several other communities , including space - plasma physics , laser - plasma physics , astroparticle , and high - energy astrophysics .",
