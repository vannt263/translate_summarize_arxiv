    "network neutrality is an approach to providing network access without unfair discrimination among applications , content or traffic sources .",
    "discrimination occurs when there are two applications , services or content providers that require the same network resources , but one is offered better quality of service ( shorter delays , higher transmission capacity , ) than the other . how to define what is `` fair '' discrimination is still subject to controversy .",
    "effective performance of its statutorily mandated responsibilities '' .",
    "the fcc was deemed , then , unable to sanction discriminatory practices on internet s traffic carried out by american isps , and the underlying case on the `` fairness '' of their discriminatory practices was not even discussed . ] a preferential treatment of traffic is considered fair as long as the preference is left to the user . throughout the world by several public consultations for new legislations on the subject .",
    "the first one , proposed in the usa , was looking for the best means of preserving a free and open internet .",
    "the second one , carried out in france , asks for different points of view over net neutrality .",
    "a third one is intended to be presented by the eu during summer 2010 , looking for a balance on the parties concerned as users are entitled to access the services they want , while isps and cps should have the right incentives and opportunities to keep investing , competing and innovating .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "internet service providers ( isps ) may have interest in traffic discrimination either for technological or economic purposes .",
    "traffic congestion , especially due to high - volume peer - to - peer traffic , has been a central argument for isps against the enforcement of net neutrality principles .",
    "however , it seems many isps have blocked or throttled such traffic independently of congestion considerations .",
    "isps recently claimed that net neutrality acts as a disincentive for capacity expansion of their networks . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the validity of this argument and came to the conclusion that , under net neutrality , isps invest to reach a social optimal level , while they tend to under / over - invest when neutrality is dropped . in their setting ,",
    "isps stand as winners while content providers ( cps ) are left in a worse position , and users who pay the isps for preferential treatment are better off while other consumers have a significantly worse service .",
    "isps often justify charging cps by quantifying the large amount of network resources `` big '' content providers use . on the other hand",
    ", the content a cp offers contributes to the demand for internet access , and thus benefits the access providers .",
    "many references advocate the use of the shapley value as a fair way to share profits between the providers , see , @xcite .",
    "one of the main benefits of this approach is that it yields pareto optimality for all players , and requires in particular that cps , many of whom receive third - party income such as advertising revenue from consumers demand , help pay for the network access that makes this new income possible .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on violations of the neutrality principles defined in @xcite where broadband service providers    * charge consumers more than `` only once '' through usage - based pricing , and * charge content providers through side - payments .    within a simple game - theoretic model ,",
    "we examine how regulated side payments , in either direction , and demand - dependent advertising revenues affect equilibrium usage - based prices . we also address equilibria in stackelberg leader - follower dynamics .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ basic - sec ] , we describe a basic model and derive nash equilibria for competitive and collaborative scenarios .",
    "we consider potentially non - neutral side - payments in section [ side - sec ] and add advertising revenues in section [ ad - sec ] , analyzing in each case how they impact equilibrium utilities .",
    "we study an isp offering multiple service classes in section [ diffserv - sec ] , and generalize our model in section [ multicp - sec ] to non - monopolistic content or access providers . in section [ stackelberg - sec ] , we consider leader - follower dynamics .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] and discuss future work .",
    "our model encompasses three actors :    * the internauts ( users ) , collectively , * a network access provider for the internauts , collectively called isp1 , and * a content provider and its isp , collectively called cp2 .",
    "the two providers play a game to settle on their ( usage - based ) prices .",
    "the internauts are modeled through their demand response .",
    "consumers are assumed willing to pay a usage - based fee ( which can be $ 0/byte ) for service / content that requires both providers .",
    "denote by @xmath0 the usage - based price leveed by provider @xmath1 ( isp1 being @xmath2 and cp2 being @xmath3 ) .",
    "we assume that the demand - response of customers , which corresponds to the amount ( in bytes ) of content / bandwidth they are ready to consume given prices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , follows a simple linear model : @xmath6 with such a profile , we are dealing with a set of homogeneous users sharing the same response coefficient @xmath7 to price variations .",
    "parameter @xmath8 corresponds to demand for zero usage - based prices , which can be considered the demand under pure _ flat - rate _ pricing assuming that the usage - based prices are overages on flat montly fees .    demand should be non - negative , @xmath9 provider @xmath1 s usage - based revenue is given by @xmath10      suppose the providers do not cooperate .",
    "a nash equilibrium point ( nep ) @xmath11 of this two - player game satisfies : @xmath12 which leads to @xmath13 .",
    "the demand at equilibrium is thus @xmath14 and the revenue of each provider is @xmath15      now suppose there is a coalition between isp1 and cp2 .",
    "their overall utility is then @xmath16 , and an nep @xmath11 satisfies @xmath17 which yields @xmath18 .",
    "the demand at equilibrium is then @xmath19 , greater than in the non - cooperative setting .",
    "the overall utility @xmath20 is also greater than @xmath21 for the competitive case .",
    "assuming both players share this revenue equally ( trivially , the shapley values are @xmath22 in this case ) , the utility per player becomes @xmath23 which is greater than in the competitive case .",
    "so , both players benefit from this coalition .",
    "let us suppose now that there are _ side payments _ between isp1 and cp2 at ( usage - based ) price @xmath24 .",
    "the revenues of the providers become : @xmath25 note that @xmath24 can be positive ( isp1 charges cp2 for `` transit '' costs ) or negative ( cp2 charges isp1 , for copyright remuneration ) .",
    "it is expected that @xmath24 is _ not _ a decision variable of the players , since their utilities are monotonic in @xmath24 and the player without control would likely set ( usage - priced ) demand to zero to avoid negative utility .",
    "that is , @xmath24 would normally be _ regulated _ and we will consider it as a fixed parameter in the following ( with @xmath26 ) .    first , if @xmath27 , the equilibrium prices are given by @xmath28 but demand @xmath29 and utilities @xmath30 are exactly the same as ( [ ui - basic - comp ] ) in the competitive setting with no side payment .",
    "therefore , though setting @xmath31 at first seems to favor isp1 over cp2 , it turns out to have no effect on equilibrium revenues for both providers .    alternatively , if @xmath32 , a boundary nash equilibrium is reached when @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which means isp1 does not charge usage - based fees to its consumers .",
    "demand becomes @xmath35 , and utilities are @xmath36 though @xmath33 , @xmath37 is still strictly positive , with revenues for isp1 coming from side - payments ( and possibly from flat - rate monthly fees as well ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath38 , which means @xmath39 : in this setting , isp1 s best move is to set his usage - based price to zero ( to increase demand ) , while he is sure to achieve better revenue than cp2 through side - payments .    finally , if @xmath40 , the situation is similar to the previous case ( with @xmath41 instead of @xmath24 ) .",
    "so , here @xmath42 and @xmath43 , leading to @xmath44 .    to remind , herein revenues @xmath45 are assumed usage - based , which means there could also be flat - rate charges in play to generate revenue for either party .",
    "studies of flat - rate compare to usage - based pricing schemes can be found in the literature , see , @xcite .",
    "we suppose now that cp2 has an additional source of ( usage - based ) revenue from advertising that amounts to @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is not a decision variable but a fixed parameter . as the result of an independent game between cp2 and his advertising sources , the details of which are out of the scope of this paper . ]",
    "the utilities for isp1 and cp2 are now : @xmath48 \\left(p_1+p_s",
    "\\right ) \\\\   \\label{u2-complete }   u_2 & = & \\left[d_0 - d \\cdot ( p_1 + p_2)\\right ] ( p_2 - p_s + p_a ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here ,",
    "the nash equilibrium prices are : @xmath49 the cost to users is thus @xmath50 while demand is @xmath51 .",
    "nash equilibrium utilities are given by @xmath52 which generalizes equation ( [ ui - basic - comp ] ) and shows how advertising revenue quadratically raises players utilities .",
    "the overall income for cooperating providers is @xmath53 so , solving the associated nep equation yields @xmath54 the nep demand is then @xmath55 , and the total revenue at nash equilibrium is @xmath56 . assuming this revenue is split equally between the two providers , we get for each provider the equilibrium utility @xmath57 which generalizes equation ( [ ui - basic - collab ] ) . as before ,",
    "providers and users are better off when they cooperate .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath58 leads to lower prices , increased demand and more revenue for _ both _ providers ( including isp1 ) .",
    "in this section , we suppose isp1 is offering two types of network access service : a low - quality one @xmath59 at price @xmath60 , and a high - quality one @xmath61 at price @xmath62 .",
    "the role of multiple service classes in a neutral network has previously been explored , in @xcite . here",
    ", we split the demand @xmath63 into @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 ( we will describe later how we implement the dichotomy between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) . for now , assume the overall demand still has a linear response profile , @xmath67    first , we make reasonable assumptions on @xmath64 :    1 .   _ pricing incentives : _ define @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is an incentive for consumers to chose between classes @xmath59 and @xmath61 : the higher @xmath69 is , the more likely users are to select @xmath59 .",
    "thus , if we take @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we may see @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 and model this pricing response with the following properties : @xmath74 2 .   _",
    "congestion incentives : _ as @xmath64 approaches @xmath63 , we assume congestion occurs in the low - quality network , further deterring users to chose it .",
    "this motivates the additional assumption that latexmath:[\\[\\label{cond - cgst }    @xmath64 _ decelerates _ as it gets closer to @xmath63 .",
    "define @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an additional users price - sensitivity parameter .",
    "the following demand relation satisfies all conditions ( [ cond - incr ] ) , ( [ cond - zero ] ) , ( [ cond - infty ] ) and ( [ cond - cgst ] ) : @xmath78 the providers utilities are then : @xmath79      if both players cooperate , their overall utility is @xmath80 there is no nep with strictly positive prices @xmath0 for @xmath81 . to specify the boundary nep ( where at least one usage - based price is zero ) , define @xmath82 and note that @xmath83 is a bijection of @xmath84 $ ] .    *",
    "if @xmath85 , nep conditions imply @xmath86 utility at the nep is therefore @xmath87 .",
    "\\left[2 + \\left(2 e^{-\\delta } - 3\\right ) \\delta \\gamma\\right]\\ ] ] in this setting , the value of @xmath88 is upper bounded by @xmath89 which is achieved when @xmath90 ( recall that @xmath91 is not a decision variable ) . * if @xmath92 , then @xmath93 and @xmath94 , yielding @xmath95    hence , irrespective of consumers sensitivity @xmath91 to the price gap @xmath69 , the best solution for the coalition is to set - up usage - based pricing for content only , at price @xmath96 , while network access is subject only to flat - rate pricing ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "now consider splitting the demand - response coefficient @xmath7 into @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , that is : @xmath101 if @xmath102 then the interior equilibrium conditions @xmath103 yield : @xmath104 when the demand - response coefficients satisfy ( [ response - rel ] ) , we have an _",
    "equilibrium line_. vector field plots of @xmath88 suggest it is attractive ( see figure [ fig - split ] ) . in this particular",
    "setting , providers can thus reach @xmath105 with usage - based pricing .        however , if @xmath106 , there exists a line of attraction , but with a non - null gradient on it driving players toward border equilibria .",
    "hence , the conclusion of subsection [ multiple - collab - subsec ] also holds in this more generalized setting .      when isp1 and cp2 compete , again there is no interior nep ( with all prices @xmath107 strictly positive ) .",
    "in fact , the condition @xmath108 implies @xmath109 and @xmath110 , so isp1 has to relax condition @xmath111 by setting @xmath92 ( only flat - rate pricing for the best - effort service @xmath59 ) .",
    "the solution to the two remaining nash equilibrium conditions is then : @xmath112 \\cdot \\pmax \\\\ p_h & = & \\frac\\gamma{2 \\sqrt{9\\gamma^2 + 2\\gamma + 1 } - 3\\gamma + 2 } \\cdot \\pmax\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by defining @xmath113 and @xmath114 , we then have @xmath115 figure [ fig - ut-1 ] shows utilities at equilibrium ( as fractions of @xmath116 ) .",
    "we see that , in any case , cp2 has the advantage in this game : @xmath117 is always greater to @xmath37 , irrespective of consumers sensitivity @xmath91 to usage - based prices .    here , @xmath118 means users are so sensitive to any usage - based price that they will always choose the best - effort service ( which is subject to flat - rate pricing ) .",
    "users price sensitivity decreases as @xmath91 increases , the limit @xmath119 corresponding to the setting of section [ basic - sec ] with @xmath120 .",
    "now suppose there are multiple cps supplying the _ same _ type of content ( competing online encyclopedias ) , so users choose one cp over another based only on price .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us consider the case with two cps denoted by cp2 and cp3 .",
    "first , let us remark that if there is a significant difference between the prices @xmath5 of cp2 and @xmath121 of cp3 , since both provide the same type of content , all consumers are likely to shift to the cheapest provider , leading us back to our initial model with one isp and one cp .",
    "so the difference introduced by multiple cps may arise when @xmath122 . suppose that , initially , @xmath123 in this case , we assume customers are evenly shared between cp2 and cp3 , so that @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the demand - reponse to the usage - based prices @xmath4 ( for network access ) and @xmath107 ( for content ) .",
    "now , if cp@xmath1 reduces its price by some small @xmath126 , some of its opponent s consumers will change cp , but not all of them since a small price gap may not convince them to go .",
    "this behavior is known as _ customer stickiness , inertia or loyalty_. to model it we rewrite @xmath45 as @xmath127 where @xmath128 denotes the usage - based price of the other cp , and the `` stickiness '' function @xmath129 has the following properties : @xmath130 when cp@xmath1 reduces its price by @xmath126 , the first - order variation in its utility is given by @xmath131 . from ( [ sticky - ui ] ) and ( [ sticky - s3 ] ) , @xmath132 d(p_1 , \\bp ) \\bp.\\ ] ] ( where @xmath133 was defined as @xmath134 . ) thus , taking consumers loyalty into consideration , the nash equilibrium condition for either cp@xmath1 becomes : @xmath135      as a first , simple loyalty model , suppose that after cp@xmath1 reduces its price by @xmath126 , the fraction of users that remain with the other cp@xmath136 is inversely proportional to its price @xmath128 , the stickiness function is @xmath137 in this setting , equilibrium condition ( [ sticky - equ ] ) becomes @xmath138 , while equilibrium condition for isp1 is @xmath139 .",
    "thus , prices at the nep are @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "demand at equilibrium is @xmath142 and the revenue of each provider is @xmath143 we see that , compared to ( [ ui - basic - comp ] ) , isp1 highly benefits from the competition between cps ( his revenue is about @xmath144 higher )",
    ". the situation would be symmetric with a single cp and two competing isps .",
    "one can consider another loyalty model where the fraction of users remaining with cp@xmath145 is proportional to the price _",
    "@xmath146 , the stickiness function is @xmath147 here condition ( [ sticky - equ ] ) becomes @xmath148 , while equilibrium condition for isp1 is still @xmath149 .",
    "resolution of this system leads to @xmath150 and @xmath151 . at the nep ,",
    "demand is thus @xmath152 and utilities are @xmath153 we see with this second setting that the outcome of the price war between cps and isp1 significantly depends on the customer inertia model used .",
    "now focusing on the first stickiness model ( [ sm1 ] ) and update the model to take into account usage - based side payments @xmath24 .",
    "the revenues become @xmath154 for same - priced cps , solving @xmath155 ( with non - nul demand ) , we find that the equilibrium conditions are @xmath156 they are now quadratic in @xmath157 , thus , for the sake of readability , let us define @xmath158    when @xmath31 ( side payments from the cps to the isp ) , resolution of this system for positive prices lead us to : @xmath159 then , demand at the nep is @xmath160 while revenues are @xmath161 what is interesting here is that both utilities are monotone in @xmath162 ( see figure [ u - eta-1 ] ) : @xmath37 decreases while @xmath163 increases with @xmath162 ( when @xmath164 , we fall back to the results ( [ sm1-u1 ] ) and ( [ sm1-ui ] ) of subsection [ s1-subsec ] ) .    . ]",
    "paradoxically enough , we see that increasing @xmath24 ( which means more usage - based side payments for isp1 ) is disadvantageous for isp1 but benefits the cps !",
    "this situation is very different from the one in section [ side - sec ] , where the isp was favored over the cp when @xmath162 was over a fixed threshold .",
    "when @xmath165 , cps receive usage - based side payments from isp1 ( ostensibly for royalties of copyrighted content ) .",
    "if @xmath166 , then @xmath167 is always negative and @xmath157 will tend to zero .",
    "this means that the best strategy for cps is to offer their content only for a flat rate , thus increasing demand and making all their usage - based profits on side payments",
    ".    otherwise , if @xmath168 , then condition ( [ sticky - equ ] ) has two solutions : @xmath169 there are therefore two equilibria :    * @xmath170 and @xmath171 : this is the case we studied in the @xmath31 setting , demand and revenues at the nep are unchanged .",
    "this equilibrium is `` stable '' in the sense that . ]",
    "@xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath174 : if cps move slightly their prices around @xmath175 , they are incented to move back . *",
    "@xmath176 and @xmath177 : in this case , demand at equilibrium is @xmath178 and revenues are given by @xmath179 however , this equilibrium is `` unstable '' in the sense that @xmath180 and @xmath181 : if cps shift their prices from @xmath182 , they are incented to shift even more , which will lead them either to the other equilibrium or to @xmath183 ( again , no usage - based pricing for content , but there may additional revenue from flat - rate fees as well ) . + . ]",
    "the isp is better off at this new nep ( see figure [ fig - u - eta-2 ] ) : regarless of the ( regulated ) value of @xmath24 , his revenue is always higher here ( and the cps revenues are always lower ) than at the other nep .",
    "this fact is consistent with the `` unstability '' we observed : if the cps happen to leave this equilibrium , they are not incented to come back",
    ".    a similar story follows if one considers multiple competing isps with one cp .",
    "also , taking advertising revenues into consideration will complicate the above computations and affect the location and `` stability '' of the neps .",
    "stackelberg equilibrium corresponds to asymmetric competition in which one competitor is the leader and the other a follower .",
    "actions are no longer taken independently : the leader takes action first , and then the follower reacts .",
    "though the dynamics of the games are different from the previous study , equations ( [ u1-complete ] ) and ( [ u2-complete ] ) still hold , with fixed @xmath184 and regulated @xmath24 . in the following ,",
    "we need to assume that @xmath185 so that neps are reachable with positive prices .",
    "if isp1 sets @xmath4 , then cp2 s optimal move is to set @xmath186 this expression yields @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "anticipating cp2 s reaction in trying to optimize @xmath189 , the best move for isp1 is thus to set @xmath190 which yields @xmath191 therefore , when isp1 is the leader , at the nep demand is @xmath192 and utilities are : @xmath193 suppose now that cp2 is the leader and sets @xmath5 first .",
    "similarly , we find : @xmath194 these values yield the same cost @xmath195 and demand @xmath196 for the internauts at the nep , while providers utilities become : @xmath197    therefore , in either case of leader - follower dynamics , the leader obtains twice the utility of the follower at the nep ( yet , his revenue is not better than in the collaborative case ) .",
    "using a simple model of linearly diminishing consumer demand as a function of usage - based price , we studied a game between a monopolistic isp and a cp under a variety of scenarios including consideration of : non - neutral two - sided transit pricing ( either cp2 participating in network costs or isp1 paying for copyright remuneration ) , advertising revenue , competition , cooperation and leadership .    in a basic model without side - payments and advertising revenues ,",
    "both providers achieve the same utility at equilibrium , and all actors are better off when they cooperate ( higher demand and providers utility ) .      * when @xmath27 , providers shift their prices to fall back to the demand of the competitive setting with no side - payments ; * when @xmath199 , the provider receiving side payments sets its usage - based price to zero to increase demand , while it is sure to be better off than his opponent .",
    "when advertising revenues to the cp come into play , they increase the utilities of _ both _ providers by reducing the overall usage - based price applied to the users .",
    "isp1 and cp2 still share the same utility at equilibrium , and the increase in revenue due to advertising is quadratic .    we considered in section [ diffserv - sec ] the implications of _ service differentiation _ from the isp . in our model , when isp1 and cp2 cooperate , the best solution for them is to set - up usage - based prices for content only and flat - rate pricing for network access .",
    "however , when providers do not cooperate , the isp optimally offers its best - effort service for a flat rate ( zero usage - based cost ) , resulting in more usage - based revenue for the cp .",
    "we considered in section [ multicp - sec ] a generalization of our model to non - monopolistic , competing cps . for a simple customer inertia model , we found that regulated side - payments had a significant impact on equilibrium revenues for the isp and the cps :    * when side payments go to the access provider , his utility at the nep diminishes , while * when they go to the content providers , the three - player system has two equilibria : an unstable one in favor of the isp , and a stable one .",
