    "in this paper we assess the prospects for deuterium synthesis resulting from @xmath0-induced neutron production in supermassive stars ( @xmath3 - these objects become dynamically unstable due to the general relativistic instability ) .",
    "we will show that this process can not account for the observed interstellar or solar system deuterium abundance . however",
    ", it might result in _ local _ enrichment of deuterium above its primordial value in the ejecta from a collapsed supermassive star .",
    "this might give a telltale sign of the existence and evolution history of pre - galactic supermassive stars - as yet there is no direct evidence for these objects ever having been extant in the universe , though it has been argued that their formation may be an inevitable consequence of the evolution of dense star clusters and perhaps ultra - low metallicity environments in the early universe ( hoyle & fowler 1963 ; begelman & rees 1978 ; fuller , woosley , & weaver 1986 , hereafter fww ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; mclaughlin & fuller 1996 ) .",
    "if such deuterium - enriched ejecta at high redshift intercept a line of sight to a more distant qso , then it could mimic a lyman limit absorber .",
    "measurement of isotope - shifted hydrogen absorption lines in such a system may then lead to an erroneous estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance ( d@xmath4h ) and , hence , an incorrect inference of the fraction of the closure density contributed by baryons , @xmath5 .",
    "future indisputable observations of significantly discordant d@xmath4h values among different lyman limit systems , or very high values of this quantity , may be a signal for the existence of pregalactic supermassive stars .",
    "confirmation of such a conjecture would depend on other evidence of supermassive star processing ( fww ) : nucleosynthesis products of hot hydrogen burning ( the @xmath6-process , wallace & woosley 1981 ) ; greatly enhanced helium abundances ; or effects of large black holes .",
    "deuterium is very fragile in stars .",
    "thus to search for the primordial value of d@xmath4h one has to look for gas clouds unprocessed by stars .",
    "low metallicity lyman @xmath2 absorbers at high redshifts are thought to be such primordial clouds with little stellar processing ( _ cf .",
    "_ jedamzik & fuller 1997 ) .",
    "so far , measurements derived from three lyman limit absorption systems are available .",
    "one indicates a high value with d / h@xmath7 ( songaila et al .",
    "1994 ; ruger & hogan 1996 ; see however tytler , burles & kirkman 1996 ) , and two yields low values with d / h@xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ( burles & tytler 1996 ; tytler , fan & burles 1996 ) .",
    "the implications of these measurements for primordial nucleosynthesis and the value of @xmath5 have been discussed extensively ( cardall & fuller 1996 ; hata _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; jedamzik & fuller 1997 ; copi , olive , & schramm 1996 ) .",
    "one may be left with an uneasy feeling regarding how representative the three systems are of lyman limit systems in general . by necessity only systems with very narrow lines",
    "can show the sought after isotope shift , and only systems with simple line profiles can minimize the chance of blending .",
    "clearly these systems comprise a small fraction of the lyman limit systems along the lines of sight to bright qso s .",
    "the great bulk of deuterium in the universe is generated by freeze - out from nuclear statistical equilibrium at high entropy in big bang nucleosynthesis ( wagoner , fowler , & hoyle 1967 ) .",
    "it has been argued effectively that the bulk of the deuterium can not be synthesized through cosmic ray spallation or photo - disintegration of nuclei ( e.g. , epstein , lattimer & schramm 1976 ; sigl _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "there are two characteristics of the deuteron which make its synthesis problematic : ( 1 ) it is the most fragile nucleus , with a binding energy of only @xmath10 ; ( 2 ) it requires free neutrons .",
    "it is not easy to obtain free neutrons in astrophysical environments , and to complicate matters , neutrons are unstable .",
    "they can only be spalled  from bound nuclei , or produced directly via the weak interaction .",
    "the former production channel is difficult because neutrons are bound in nuclei by @xmath11 ; while the latter channel is problematic because weak interactions are inherently slow .",
    "having somehow produced a free neutron , significant synthesis of deuterons then requires that the n(p,@xmath12)d rate be fast compared to the free neutron decay rate and the local material / thermodynamic expansion timescale , while the primary deuteron destruction process , d(p,@xmath12)@xmath13he , is slow compared to the local material / thermodynamic expansion timescale .",
    "supermassive stars come close to satisfying these requirements as they are low baryon density , relatively cool , high entropy configurations , in which the n(p,@xmath12)d rate is relatively fast and the d(p,@xmath12)@xmath13he rate is relatively slow .",
    "the free neutrons , in this case , are produced by intense neutrino fluxes released during the collapse of supermassive stars via the weak reaction @xmath14 .",
    "the crux issue in this scenario for deuterium production hinges on whether _ any _ material in these stars can be ejected from regions where all the requirements to yield significant d@xmath4h enrichment are satisfied . indeed ,",
    "woosley ( 1977 ) suggested that something like this process could account for all of the deuterium in the universe . though we will argue that this is not possible given our current understanding of how supermassive stars evolve ( fww )",
    ", it may still lead to significant local deuterium abundance enrichments , to as high as @xmath15 .",
    "we also show that the possibility that supermassive star ejecta form a lyman limit system  is consistent with the characteristics of the currently observed lyman @xmath2 absorption systems from which d / h values have been measured .",
    "we then discuss how to eliminate this possibility by further observations .",
    "in this section we will describe how d@xmath4h can be enhanced in some regions of a supermassive star via this three step scenario :    * the star collapses and , near the point where the homologously collapsing core becomes a black hole , a fraction of the gravitational binding energy is radiated as thermally - produced @xmath16 pairs . *",
    "the process @xmath14 creates free neutrons further out in regions of the star where material ejection is possible . *",
    "these neutrons undergo n(p,@xmath12)d on a timescale short compared to the material expansion timescale and the neutron decay lifetime ; yet the lifetime of the deuteron against destruction via d(p,@xmath12)@xmath13he is long compared to the disassembly time ( or inverse expansion rate ) of this region of the star .    leaving aside the thorny and unresolved issue of how a supermassive star could be formed , it is instructive to review the simple structure and evolution of nonrotating , primordial - composition supermassive stars ( fww ) . these stars are radiation dominated , with essentially all the pressure support coming from photons , while nearly all the mass - energy in the star is contributed by baryon rest mass .",
    "these stars will have an adiabatic index @xmath17 , will be nearly constant entropy , fully convective configurations , and as a result will be very accurately described as an index @xmath18 newtonian polytrope .",
    "such a configuration will have close to zero total ( internal plus newtonian gravitational ) binding energy and will be trembling on the verge of instability  as outlined by fowler ( 1964 ) and iben ( 1963 ) .",
    "additionally , this configuration will be radiating at the photon eddington limit . as a result",
    ", the star will resemble an over - sized wolf - rayet star and will be accompanied by continual and significant mass loss during its lifetime",
    ". this lifetime will be quite short , however , as the star will quasi - statically contract as it radiates away entropy .",
    "this will continue until the central density reaches a critical value , beyond which general relativistic effects ensure that the star becomes dynamically unstable .",
    "this instability point is roughly coincident with the onset of hydrogen burning for stars with masses @xmath19 .",
    "the subsequent fate of the star depends on a number of factors , principally composition , rotation and magnetic pressure .",
    "explosion or collapse to a black hole depends on how rapidly thermal energy can be added to the system through the competition between hot hydrogen burning on the one hand , and thermal neutrino losses and the build - up of infall kinetic energy on the other . in general , collapse to a black hole is probably inevitable for a zero metallicity , nonrotating initial configuration ( fww ) .",
    "however , there is a generic feature of this collapse which serves to isolate an outer region of the star from a homologous core  which will plunge through the event horizon as a unit .",
    "initially the entire star will collapse homologously , but as pressure is relatively reduced in the center by thermal neutrino emission , only an inner part of the star can continue to collapse homologously ( goldreich & weber 1980 ; fww ) .",
    "the boundary of this homologous core ( as well as the mass enclosed ) depends on the entropy per baryon , which in turn depends on the history of nuclear burning - driven entropy increase and neutrino loss - driven entropy decrease ( fww ; fuller & shi 1997 ) .",
    "material outside of this core could be subject to ejection resulting from neutrino heating ( fuller & shi 1997 ) , and/or hot @xmath6-process nuclear burning - driven convection combined with rotation and mhd effects ( _ cf .",
    "_ , ozernoi & usov 1971 ; fowler 1966 ) .",
    "our work here is meant to suggest that detailed multi - dimensional numerical modeling of these scenarios merits serious attention .",
    "prodigious thermal neutrino losses will accompany the collapse of the homologous core ( fww ) .",
    "the peak neutrino - pair production rate will come near the point where the homologous core of mass @xmath20 approaches its schwarzschild radius , @xmath21 , where the average density is @xmath22 .",
    "crudely , the newtonian gravitational binding energy at this point is @xmath23 , while the free fall timescale is @xmath24 .",
    "not all of the gravitational binding energy will be carried away by neutrinos .",
    "a fraction of the binding energy could reside in infall kinetic energy and thermal energy , or be dissipated in magnetic modes , or be stored  in rotational kinetic energy . in addition , neutrinos radiated from the core will be gravitationally redshifted .",
    "we designate the fraction of the binding energy radiated by neutrinos by @xmath25 .",
    "this quantity @xmath25 will be a significant fraction of unity if neutrinos are not trapped in the homologous core as a result of their mean free path becoming short compared to the core radius .",
    "( fuller & shi 1997 find that such trapping is unlikely except very near the black hole formation point for stars with initial masses above @xmath26 . )    during the collapse the temperature will be @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is entropy per baryon in units of 10@xmath29 boltzmann s constant , @xmath30 is the density in @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the statistical weight in relativistic particles ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ) .",
    "@xmath28 is typically between 1 to 10 . near the endpoint of collapse ,",
    "the core temperature will be of order @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the homologous core mass in units of @xmath39 at the blackhole formation point . allowing for entropy loss by thermal neutrino emission and including a fair amount of angular momentum / centrifugal support for @xmath40",
    "suggests that @xmath41 could be about an order of magnitude smaller than the initial stellar mass ( fuller & shi 1997 ) .",
    "this implies that typical temperatures will be @xmath42 to 20 at the collapse endpoint for initial stellar configurations with @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath42 to 20 the average energy of neutrinos produced as pairs in @xmath44 annihilation will be ( _ cf .",
    "_ schinder _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ; itoh et al .",
    "1989 ) @xmath45 to 12 mev",
    ". the neutrino energy will suffer an undetermined gravitational redshift of order 1 , but for simplicity we absorb the redshift into the factor @xmath25 .",
    "the probability that the process @xmath46 converts protons at radius @xmath47 into neutrons is : @xmath48 the third term in this equation is the fraction of neutrinos which are @xmath0 , and is typically about @xmath49 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath0 absorption on protons is @xmath50 when @xmath51 mev .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 with this expression we can estimate that @xmath53 when @xmath54 and @xmath55 for a homologous core mass of @xmath56 .",
    "this is an interesting figure of merit , as it is roughly the lowest reasonable value for the primordial deuterium abundance - any production above this value would correspond to d / h enhancement .",
    "a @xmath57 of 10@xmath58 is not out of reach if @xmath25 can be as high as 60@xmath59 .",
    "note that a baryon at @xmath55 for the indicated value of @xmath60 would have a gravitational binding energy of order @xmath61 of its rest mass .",
    "the key question is whether there are any circumstances under which material with this binding energy could acquire enough thermal energy that ejection would be possible ( fuller & shi 1997 ) .    here",
    "@xmath57 will also be the amount of deuterium enrichment relative to hydrogen in the limit where the reaction n(p,@xmath12)d is fast compared to the material ejection rate and the free neutron decay rate and where the deuteron destruction process d(p,@xmath12)@xmath13he is slow compared to the material ejection rate . in fact such conditions can be attained for some outer regions of the supermassive star as we illustrate in figure 1 . in this figure",
    "the material ejection timescale is taken to be the free - fall timescale , as they are typically of the same order .",
    "the stippled region corresponds to thermodynamic and expansion conditions where deuterium can be produced and can survive .",
    "the fate of the initial primordial deuterium in the envelope is unclear .",
    "supermassive stars are convective during their pre - collapse contraction phase . if their convection proceeds faster than the contraction , and their central temperatures during most of the contraction phase are high enough to burn deuterium , the primordial deuterium may be destroyed in the entire star before collapse .",
    "this could occur in less massive supermassive stars whose central temperatures are higher .",
    "once the enriched envelope of a supermassive star is ejected , it expands freely in space and eventually cools down to @xmath62 k , in equilibrium with ambient uv radiation .",
    "its expansion velocity is at least @xmath63 km / sec , the thermal speed at @xmath64 k. it can easily expand to a size of 1 kpc , unless it encounters another cosmic structure or is slowed down simply by loading of the ambient medium .",
    "the ambient baryonic mass swept up by the envelope is on average @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the average matter density at a redshift @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the radius of the expanding envelope . at @xmath69 to 3 , this mass will be larger than the mass of the ejected envelope if @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the expansion of the envelope up to @xmath71 kpc can be essentially free , and its chemical composition can be essentially unperturbed .",
    "the number of such envelope systems in one quasar line of sight is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the density parameter of baryons in supermassive stars , and @xmath74 their masses .",
    "@xmath75 mpc is the proper distance interval under investigation in a quasar line of sight , @xmath76 years is the duration of the free expansion , and @xmath77 few @xmath78 years is the age of the universe then .",
    "therefore , even if we assume that 10@xmath79 of the mass of our universe ( or 0.01@xmath59 to 0.1@xmath59 of baryons ) is in these supermassive stars at @xmath80 2 to 3 , we can expect to see at least one such envelope absorber in tens of quasars . in comparison ,",
    "there are reported detections from 3 lyman limit systems from surveys of @xmath81 quasars , a statistic that can easily be accommodated by these absorbers being ejected envelopes of supermassive stars .",
    "the column densities of these ejected ejected envelopes are approximately @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ionization fraction of the envelope , @xmath84 is its mass , and @xmath85 is the proton mass . with a temperature of @xmath62k and the envelope in photoionization equilibrium with the ambient photoionizing uv background , @xmath86 .",
    "therefore the resultant column density is that of a lyman limit system , @xmath87 @xmath88 , with @xmath89 being a significant portion of the parent mass @xmath90 .",
    "curiously enough , all three lyman limit systems with reported detections of d / h have double components .",
    "this is fully consistent with the geometry of ejected envelopes .",
    "the velocity separations between the double components range from 11 to 20 km / sec , which can easily be produced if the envelopes expand at @xmath63 km / sec .",
    "the double components that yield the lower d / h are quite asymmetric , however .",
    "but one can not rule out the expanding envelope scenario on this information alone because so far we have only considered the simplest case of spherical symmetry .",
    "asymmetries can easily arise due to asymmetric ejections or structures in the ambient medium .",
    "the spectral profiles of the measured clouds indicate temperatures of @xmath62k with small turbulence motion .",
    "our freely expanding envelope scenario fits these features , too .",
    "explanation of low metalicities in these clouds with measured d / h are not a problem either , because even though the supermassive stars may undergo hot hydrogen burning and break - out to the @xmath6 process they may not eject significant amounts of nucleosynthesis products from deep in their cores .",
    "these stars , however , could produce huge amounts of @xmath91he ( fww ) .",
    "selection criteria dictate that systems with high deuterium abundances are most likely to be picked out .",
    "therefore , if pop iii supermassive stars existed in the early stage of our universe and they ejected material , all or some of the 3 lyman limit systems with detected deuterium abundances may be accounted for by the ejected envelopes of these stars .",
    "the required population of these supermassive stars need not be great .",
    "one thousandth of baryons in the universe forming supermassive stars can be enough .",
    "there is no conflict in having a universe where @xmath92 of its baryonic mass is in @xmath93 black holes some of these black hole remnants of supermassive stars may even assume a role in galaxy formation by accreting mass and becoming the massive black holes observed at the center of many galaxies ( van der marel et al .",
    "thus far we have found that :    * anti - electron neutrinos from collapse of supermassive stars can produce enough free neutrons in outer layers of supermassive stars to boost the deuterium abundance there to @xmath94 to 10@xmath58 . *",
    "if the deuterium - enriched outer layers get ejected , they can reach a large enough size that they could mimic low metalicity lyman limit absorbers at high redshifts .",
    "the chance of seeing such a lyman limit absorber in a quasar line of sight is about 1 in several tens if 0.01@xmath59 to @xmath95 of baryons are in supermassive stars at a redshift of 2 to 3 , comparable to the current detection probability .",
    "here we especially stress that the ejecta can not enhance the global deuterium abundance in any significant manner , because ( 1 ) only a small fraction of baryons may be in the form of supermassive stars ( otherwise most of the baryons now would be in black holes ) , and ( 2 ) only a small fraction of supermassive star material may be ejected due to the depth of the gravitational potential .",
    "however , we also note that since the chance of seeing such a local enrichment of deuterium in quasar lines of sight may not be low , we have to be extremely cautious before we can take a d@xmath4h measurement in lyman limit absorbers as primordial .",
    "so how can we assure ourselves that measurements of d@xmath4h in lyman @xmath2 systems reflect the primordial value ?",
    "first , we do not expect most lyman limit systems to be envelopes of supermassive stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the enrichment process is sensitive to the conditions in the parent stars , and should not yield a uniform deuterium abundance .",
    "consequently , if further observations yield significantly more detections with a concordant deuterium abundance , it is highly unlikely that we are measuring enriched values .",
    "second , if the size of lyman @xmath2 absorbers with measured d / h is established by double quasar lines of sight to be @xmath96 kpc , they can not be ejecta of supermassive stars .",
    "their deuterium abundances are therefore not enriched .",
    "third , the epoch of supermassive stars may not last long .",
    "thus , observations by the hubble space telescope of low metalicity absorbers at @xmath97 might avoid the enrichment problem .",
    "however , one should then also worry about the destruction problem , that is , whether these absorbers have been processed through stars and their deuterium has been destroyed ( jedamzik & fuller 1997 ) .",
    "ultimately , evidence for supermassive star processing through enhanced d / h values would suggest that there is some way in which neutrino - exposed ejecta can escape from fairly deep in the gravitational potential well of these stars , and the d / h values derived from lyman limit absorption systems could probe yet another aspect of structure formation in the early universe . along with an enhanced helium abundance , an enhanced deuterium abundance in lyman @xmath2 absorption systems may signal the existence of supermassive stars at high redshifts .",
