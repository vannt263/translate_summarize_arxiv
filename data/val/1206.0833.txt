    "in one dimension , a wave packet of noninteracting particles subject to a random potential does not diffuse because of anderson localization , due to the exponential localization of the eigenstates of the underlying hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "instead the presence of interactions is expected to act against localization , though the actual mechanism may be highly nontrivial and may depend on the type of disorder and interaction .",
    "this is a problem of fundamental importance for many systems in different contexts . from the theoretical side ,",
    "it has been largely studied by using discrete lattices . the interaction is often included by means of mean - field theories , where it enters in the form of a nonlinear local term in a nonlinear schrdinger - like equation @xcite .    numerical simulations of wave packets propagating in a random potential  with",
    "the interaction included via a nonlinear mean - field term  showed that the presence of interaction indeed destroys localization and leads to a subdiffusive growth of the second moment of the wave packet in time as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in particular it was predicted that at large @xmath4 , the coefficient @xmath5 should converge to @xmath6 in a regime of so - called `` weak chaos '' , as opposed to normal diffusion where @xmath7 and the wave packet width grows as @xmath8 .",
    "a transient regime of `` strong chaos '' was also identified , where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of these different regimes can be predicted by comparing the nonlinear frequency shift introduced by the expanding wave packet to the typical energy scales of linear spectra of random models .    exponential localization for noninteracting quantum particles ( or linear waves ) can be found also in systems which are not truly disordered .",
    "an example is provided by quasiperiodic potentials , which are of great interest by themselves @xcite .",
    "these systems can be considered to lie between the two extreme cases of a perfectly periodic system and a pure random potential . by tuning the parameters of a quasiperiodic system ,",
    "the localization properties can change dramatically  from having all extended states to all localized states .",
    "in recent years , exponential localization has been observed with light propagating in quasiperiodic photonic lattices @xcite , as well as with ultracold atoms propagating in a bichromatic optical lattice @xcite .",
    "notably in both cases the inclusion of interaction is experimentally feasible , by using a kerr medium for light and tuning the scattering length by means of a suitable magnetic field for atoms .",
    "numerical simulations studying nonlinear dynamics of wave packets have been performed also in the case of quasiperiodic systems @xcite . in particular for exponentially localized linear waves ,",
    "nonlinearity yields subdiffusive spreading of wave packets as well @xcite . however , there are clear indications that the coefficient @xmath5 , at least at finite spreading times , is significantly larger than the one observed in random systems .",
    "nonlinear effects have been also studied in experiments using ultracold atoms and light propagating in photonic lattices . in both cases",
    "it has been shown that nonlinearity acts against localization @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to clarify the details of the spreading mechanism leading to the destruction of the localization in quasiperiodic systems , and to address differences and similarities between quasiperiodic and purely random potentials .",
    "we extend and refine previous numerical investigations by pushing the simulations to much longer times , thus allowing for the identification of the strong and weak chaos regimes in quasiperiodic systems and compare the situation with known properties of purely random systems .",
    "for this purpose , we use two different models ; namely , a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) and a quasiperiodic version of the quartic klein - gordon ( kg ) lattice model .",
    "a key result of the present work is that a regime of weak chaos is indeed observed in the long time spreading of nonlinear wave packets propagating in quasiperiodic systems ; in particular we find that the asymptotic value of the spreading coefficient @xmath5 is @xmath6 as in purely random systems , thus showing that this behaviour is rather general and model independent .",
    "another similarity with purely random systems is the occurrence of self - trapping : when the nonlinear interaction is large enough to shift the mode frequencies so strongly that they are tuned out of resonance with all nonexcited neighbouring modes , a part of the wave packet remains spatially localized @xcite .",
    "however as opposed to the random system , in the quasiperiodic case partial self - trapping is also possible for weaker nonlinearities .",
    "this is due to the complexity of the linear wave spectrum which exhibits a fractal gap structure of sub - bands .",
    "self - trapping gives rise to transient spreading regimes characterized by an intermediate large exponent @xmath5 ; we call this effect `` overshooting '' .",
    "finally , we have also observed signatures of strong chaos , but detection of this regime is difficult in quasiperiodic systems , since it is often masked by overshooting and partial self - trapping , which occur on the same temporal scales .",
    "we consider two different models : the first is the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quasiperiodic discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath10\\ , , \\label{eq : h_dnls}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 labels the lattice sites and @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 gives the probability to find a particle at site @xmath11 .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_dnls ] ) describes the hopping between nearest neighbouring sites , the second term describes the quasiperiodic on - site energy , while the last term represents the mean - field interaction energy and introduces the nonlinearity .",
    "the key parameters of this hamiltonian are the strength of the quasiperiodic potential @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 the lattice is periodic with period @xmath16 ) , the strength of the nonlinearity @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 the particles are non - interacting ) , and the irrational number @xmath19 which causes the underlying potential to be quasiperiodic .",
    "in fact , when @xmath19 is irrational the cosine adds a second periodicity which is incommensurate with respect to the underlying periodicity given by the discreteness of the system .",

    "the set can be used for a wide range of applications , including ultracold atoms expanding in optical lattices @xcite and light propagating in photonic lattices @xcite .",

    "the kg model has also been extensively studied , since it can give a simple description of the nondissipative dynamics of anharmonic optical lattice vibrations in molecular crystals @xcite .",
    "the total energy of the system @xmath37 serves as a control parameter of nonlinearity , analogous to @xmath17 for the dnls model .",
    "in fact , for small amplitudes the equation of the kg chain can be approximately mapped onto a dnls model @xcite using @xmath38 .",
    "further analytics will be discussed only in terms of the dnls chain , since it is then straightforward to project to the kg model .    for the dnls model we measure the spreading of the wave packet by tracking the quantity @xmath39 , hereafter named norm density consistently with the notation of refs.@xcite .",
    "the key quantities that we use to describe the time evolution of the expanding wave packet are the second moment @xmath40 , ( @xmath41 ) which quantifies the spatial extent of the wave packet , and the participation number @xmath42 which measures the number of significantly populated sites .",
    "a combination of these two quantities @xmath43 , called compactness index , gives a measure of the sparsity of a wave packet @xcite .",

    "this is an overshooting similar to the one that we have discussed above for the self - trapping regime , but occurring also for weaker nonlinearity .",
    "this effect is unique to the quasiperiodic system and is likely due to the presence of an infinite number of mini - bands and gaps in the linear spectrum of the hamiltonian , which causes a temporary self - trapping of portions of the expanding wave packet in one or more energy gaps between mini - bands .",
    "this partial self - trapping is different from the self - trapping that occurs when @xmath105 , where all the packet modes are simultaneously shifted out of resonance . for this reason partial self - trapping is not detectable as a saturation of the participation number @xmath151 and can only be seen indirectly as an overshooting in the exponent @xmath5 .",

    "we indeed find a spreading exponent which approaches asymptotically the value @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 the predicted behaviour is either strong chaos or a regime in between strong and weak chaos .",
    "what we observe numerically is a growth of the spreading exponent @xmath5 up to @xmath154 and even to larger values , followed by a decrease towards @xmath6 . in most cases ,",
    "our simulations show a significant overshooting due to partial self - trapping .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this effect is larger for weaker disorder strength @xmath14 , consistent with the fact the linear spectrum exhibits larger mini - gaps in this regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) . finally for @xmath173",
    ", we observe self - trapping , as expected .    in conclusion , from the analysis of the results of the dnls model for different values of @xmath14 we find that the energy scale arguments and the model discussed in section iv correctly explain the overall trend of the numerical simulations and the separation between different spreading regimes in the parameter space .",
    "due to the existence of a mapping between kg and dnls , we expect to observe the same spreading regimes in the two models .",
    "this has been already proven in purely random systems where the two models reveal similar qualitative results in a wide range of parameters @xcite . despite this similarity",
    ", the study of the kg model remains interesting for at least two reasons .",
    "on one hand , it allows for testing the generality of the result in a case where there is just one conserved quantity .",
    "this is highly nontrivial  especially for self - trapping  for which rigorous results have been recently derived only in the case of hamiltonians conserving both energy and norm @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the kg model is advantageous from a numerical point of view .",
    "the fact that there is just one conserved quantity results in two orders of magnitude faster integration speed within the same integration error .",
    "similarly to what was done for the dnls model , we initially set the compact wave packets to span a width @xmath147 ( unless otherwise stated ) centered in the lattice , such that each site has equal energy @xmath174 .",
    "this is implemented by setting initial momenta of @xmath175 with randomly assigned signs and zero coordinates .",
    "the values of initial energy densities @xmath96 are chosen to give expected spreading regimes of asymptotic weak chaos , intermediate strong chaos , and dynamical crossover from strong chaos to the slower weak chaos subdiffusive spreading @xcite .",
    "the results of the time simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_kg ] , while the expected spreading regimes are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_scales ] ( full upward triangles ) @xcite .",
    "as one can see by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : num_kg ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : time_evolution ] , the qualitative behaviour of the two models is rather similar .",
    "after initial transients , which increase with decreasing nonlinearity , all kg simulations reveal subdiffusive growth of the second moment @xmath0 according to power law @xmath176 with @xmath101 .",
    "if self - trapping is avoided , all simulations show a similar subdiffusive behaviour for the participation numbers ; moreover , the wave packets remain compact as they spread , since compactness indices at the largest computational times saturate around a constant @xmath177 .",
    "for the two smallest values of initial energy density @xmath178 and @xmath179 , the characteristics of the weak chaos regime are observed , namely , the exponent @xmath5 saturates around @xmath6 ( red and green curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_kg ] ) after a transient time .",
    "we stress that the only difference from the purely random systems is the overshooting phenomenon at transient times .",
    "this effect is an inherent property of quasiperiodic systems which inevitably manifests itself in all spreading regimes , while in the disordered case it was shown to occur only in the regime of self - trapping @xcite .",
    "for the two energy densities @xmath180 and @xmath181 we suggest strong chaos , with characteristics similar to the dnls case .",
    "the simulation with @xmath180 ( blue curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_kg ] ) indeed exhibits the typical behaviour of the strong chaos scenario : the characteristic exponent @xmath5 increases up to predicted value @xmath154 and remains so for about two time decades , followed by a crossover with @xmath5 decreasing to the weak chaos dynamics .",
    "there is also another possibility for larger @xmath182 , when intermediate strong chaos is masked due to partial self - trapping ( magenta curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_kg ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath5 shows values larger then @xmath154 but still with subsequent decay to slower subdiffusion . here",
    ", we would like to strongly emphasize that none of the simulations exhibit pronounced deviations from strong or weak chaos regimes of spreading , i.e. long - lasting overshooting with @xmath183 , or significant slowing down to values @xmath184 .",
    "finally , for @xmath185 the dynamics enter the self - trapping regime , as our theory predicts .",
    "there a major part of the initial excitation stays localized , while the remainder spreads ( yellow curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_kg ] ) .",
    "the participation numbers , therefore , do not grow significantly and @xmath186 starts to level off at large time ( fig .  [ fig : num_kg ] , left panel , bottom , yellow curve ) .",
    "in contrast , the small spreading portion yields a continuous increase of the second moment @xmath0 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : num_kg ] , left panel , top , yellow curve ) , which initially is characterized by large values of @xmath187 ( howbeit , for larger time @xmath5 decreases ) .",
    "consequently , the compactness index @xmath188 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : num_kg ] , right panel , bottom , yellow curve ) drops down to small values indicating deep self - trapping regime .",
    "note that a similar behaviour has been observed before in purely random systems @xcite .",
    "unusually large values of @xmath0 can be explained by local trapping - detrapping processes in the evolving wave packet .",
    "the corresponding dynamics is in strong non - equilibrium  its theoretical description has yet to be developed .      in this subsection",
    "we show that the results discussed so far do not depend on the shape of the initial wave packet .",
    "besides its theoretical interest , this issue is also relevant from the point of view of experiments , where it is not always possible to design the wave packets at will .    in the previous sections",
    ", we have used a square distribution as the initial wavepacket .",
    "now , inspired by the experiments with ultracold atoms , we consider initial wave packets with the shape of a gaussian distribution or a thomas - fermi ( tf ) distribution .",
    "the gaussian wave packet centered around the site @xmath189 has the form @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a parameter controlling the width of the packet while @xmath192 is a constant factor that can be determined by using the normalization condition @xmath193 .",
    "a thomas - fermi wave packet is instead defined by @xmath194 in the region where @xmath195 and @xmath196 otherwise .",
    "the parameter @xmath197 is the thomas - fermi radius characterizing the width of the distribution , while the constant @xmath198 is a normalization factor .",
    "these two distributions are of interest when considering ultracold bosons initially released from an harmonic trap in the gross - pitaevskii regime @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : different_packets ] we show the time evolution in the dnls model of the second moment of the expanding wave packet , @xmath199 ( top row ) and of the spreading exponent , @xmath5 ( bottom row ) , using initially a gaussian ( left column ) and a tf ( right column ) wave packet distribution . in the insets",
    "we also show the compactness index @xmath150 , in order to identify the self - trapping regime .",
    "we choose the width of the initial distributions ( @xmath191 and @xmath197 ) so that the nonlinear frequency shift is similar to the one already used for the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_evolution ] @xcite .",
    "in particular we use @xmath200 and @xmath201 , yielding a nonlinear frequency shift @xmath202 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 used in fig .",
    "[ fig : different_packets ] are the same as those previously considered .    from the comparison between the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : different_packets ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : time_evolution ] , we can conclude that the shape of the initial wave packet does not affect the overall behaviour of the time evolution , nor its interpretation in terms of regimes of weak and strong chaos , self - trapping , and overshooting .",
    "this suggests the results that we have obtained are rather general and that the nonlinear frequency shift @xmath95 is the only key parameter controlling the dynamics of the wave packet .     and spreading exponent , @xmath5 as a function of time for different nonlinearities @xmath203 .",
    "the disorder strength is @xmath127 in all simulations . as an initial condition",
    ", we have used a gaussian wave packet with @xmath200 ( left plots ) and a tf distribution with @xmath204 ( right plots ) .",
    "the width of the lines represents the statistical error as in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_evolution ] .",

    "the dnls model can be used to simulate the dynamics of bosons in optical lattices at zero temperature @xcite and in the tight - binding regime , where the dnls equation corresponds to a discretized version of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate in the single - band approximation .",
    "the validity of this mean - field theory is not ensured for those dynamical regimes where gp predicts chaos @xcite , which can be viewed as a signature of a large depletion of the condensate .",
    "for this reason , in the presence of disorder the theory fails to predict the long time evolution of observables directly related to small scale fluctuations and long - range coherence .",
    "however , for coarse - grained observables , like the width of the wave packet in real and momentum space , or the participation number , the predictions of the theory remain very good even in regimes where the depletion is expected to be large , long after the random fluctuations prevent the prediction of fine scale structures .",
    "this has been recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite by comparing the predictions of the gp equation with one beyond mean - field theory in numerical simulations within timescales of the order of typical experiments with cold atoms and long enough to observe the effects of depletion and chaotic dynamics .",
    "indeed our analysis is essentially based on coarse - grained observables .",
    "in addition , for each set of parameters we also average over many realizations and this extends the validity of the present approach even for longer times , as any residual dependence on small scale fluctuations is further suppressed by the averaging procedure .    when applied to bosons expanding in bichromatic optical lattices ,",
    "our results provide a consistent interpretation of the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a bose - einstein condensate , initially confined in an harmonic trap , is let free to expand in a bichromatic potential",
    ". in our dimensionless units , the expansion lasts for times of the order of @xmath205 ( see @xcite for more details ) and the width of the atomic cloud increases up to @xmath206 lattice sites . in this experiment a subdiffusive spreading is observed with exponents @xmath5 significantly larger than @xmath6 already for weak nonlinearities and even larger than @xmath154 for larger nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "our work suggests that such large values of @xmath5 can be explained in terms of a transient overshooting caused by partial self - trapping in mini - bands .",
    "in this work we have considered the problem of the interplay between localization and interaction in one - dimensional quasiperiodic systems .",
    "we have investigated the expansion of initially localized wave packets in two different quasiperiodic models , dnls and kg .",
    "we have confirmed that interaction destroys localization , giving rise to a subdiffusive growth of the second moment of the wave packet ( @xmath100 with @xmath101 ) .",
    "we have interpreted the spreading process in terms of resonances in the mode - mode coupling . in particular , we have identified the different spreading regimes of self - trapping , strong chaos and weak chaos by comparing the frequency shift induced by the nonlinearity with the energy scales extracted from the spectrum of the underlying linear system . for weak and strong chaos regimes we have also predicted the expected spreading exponents @xmath156 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations , which last for much longer times than existing simulations , and we have averaged our results over many realizations . this gave us the possibility to accurately calculate the spreading exponent @xmath5 and observe the weak chaos regime . a key difference with respect to random systems",
    "@xcite is the occurrence of transient overshooting regimes that we interpret as due to the peculiar structure of the linear spectrum of the quasiperiodic system , which is separated into mini - bands .",
    "these mini - bands are responsible for mechanisms of partial self - trapping .",
    "signatures of strong chaos have also been observed , but the temporal overlap of strong chaos and partial self - trapping makes the analysis of the spreading more complex than for random systems .",
    "we have also verified that our main results do not depend on the details of the shape of the initial wave packet .",
    "this suggests that the nonlinear frequency shift , @xmath95 , is the only parameter that controls the dynamics .",

    "we are indebted to g. modugno and e. lucioni for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work has been supported by erc through the qgbe grant and by the upv / ehu under program ufi 11/55 .",
    "an intuitive understanding of this band structure can be given , following an heuristic argument .",
    "the wavelength of the potential @xmath21 is @xmath208 an effective wavelength equal to an integer number @xmath209 would correspond to a separation in exactly @xmath209 bands .",
    "our value of @xmath210 lies between two and three , so that the band structure has neither two nor three bands , but three main bands with an internal structure of sub - bands .",
    "the self - trapping regime for the dnls case can be understood also in terms of energy and particle conservation @xcite . due to particle conservation ,",
    "the particle density decreases during the spreading , which implies a decreasing of the mean - field interaction energy . if @xmath105 , the nonlinearity is so dominant that the linear part of the hamiltonian is unable to compensate the loss of mean - field energy ;",
    "therefore a part of the wave packet does not spread and stays localized .",
    "the presence of gaps in the linear spectrum is then a necessary condition for the occurrence of self - trapping .",
