    "_ from oxford university reported their design of a frequency scanned interferometer ( fsi ) for precise alignment of the atlas inner detector @xcite .",
    "given the demonstrated need for improvements in detector performance , we plan to design an enhanced fsi system to be used for the alignment of tracker elements in the next generation of electron positron linear collider detectors .",
    "current plans for future detectors require a spatial resolution for signals from a tracker detector , such as a silicon microstrip or silicon drift detector , to be approximately 7 - 10 @xmath1@xcite . to achieve this required spatial resolution",
    ", the measurement precision of absolute distance changes of tracker elements in one dimension should be on the order of 1 @xmath1 .",
    "simultaneous measurements from hundreds of interferometers will be used to determine the 3-dimensional positions of the tracker elements .",
    "the university of michigan group constructed two demonstration frequency scanned interferometer ( fsi ) systems with laser beams transported by air or single - mode optical fiber in the laboratory for initial feasibility studies .",
    "absolute distance was determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency@xcite .",
    "the main goal of the demonstration systems was to determine the potential accuracy of absolute distance measurements that could be achieved under controlled conditions .",
    "secondary goals included estimating the effects of vibrations and studying error sources crucial to the absolute distance accuracy .",
    "the main contents of this proceedings article come from our published paper@xcite .",
    "however , new material in this paper includes a description of a dual - laser system and a possible optical alignment for a silicon tracker detector .",
    "the intensity @xmath2 of any two - beam interferometer can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the intensities of the two combined beams , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the phases . assuming the optical path lengths of the two beams are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the phase difference in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical frequency of the laser beam , and c is the speed of light .    for a fixed path interferometer , as the frequency of the laser",
    "is continuously scanned , the optical beams will constructively and destructively interfere , causing `` fringes '' .",
    "the number of fringes @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the optical path difference between the two beams , and @xmath15 is the scanned frequency range .",
    "the optical path difference ( opd for absolute distance between beamsplitter and retroreflector ) can be determined by counting interference fringes while scanning the laser frequency .",
    "a schematic of the fsi system with a pair of optical fibers is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the light source is a new focus velocity 6308 tunable laser ( 665.1 nm @xmath16 675.2 nm ) . a high - finesse ( @xmath17 ) thorlabs sa200 f",
    "- p is used to measure the frequency range scanned by the laser . the free spectral range ( fsr ) of two adjacent f - p peaks",
    "is 1.5 ghz , which corresponds to 0.002 nm .",
    "a faraday isolator was used to reject light reflected back into the lasing cavity .",
    "the laser beam was coupled into a single - mode optical fiber with a fiber coupler .",
    "data acquisition is based on a national instruments daq card capable of simultaneously sampling 4 channels at a rate of 5 ms / s / ch with a precision of 12-bits .",
    "omega thermistors with a tolerance of 0.02 k and a precision of 0.01 @xmath18 are used to monitor temperature .",
    "the apparatus is supported on a damped newport optical table .    in order to reduce air flow and temperature fluctuations ,",
    "a transparent plastic box was constructed on top of the optical table .",
    "pvc pipes were installed to shield the volume of air surrounding the laser beam . inside the pvc pipes ,",
    "the typical standard deviation of 20 temperature measurements was about @xmath19 .",
    "temperature fluctuations were suppressed by a factor of approximately 100 by employing the plastic box and pvc pipes .",
    "detectors for hep experiments must usually be operated remotely for safety reasons because of intensive radiation , high voltage or strong magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , precise tracking elements are typically surrounded by other detector components , making access difficult . for practical hep application of fsi , optical fibers for light delivery and return",
    "are therefore necessary .",
    "the beam intensity coupled into the return optical fiber is very weak , requiring ultra - sensitive photodetectors for detection .",
    "considering the limited laser beam intensity and the need to split into many beams to serve a set of interferometers , it is vital to increase the geometrical efficiency . to this end , a collimator is built by placing an optical fiber in a ferrule ( 1 mm diameter ) and gluing one end of the optical fiber to a grin lens .",
    "the grin lens is a 0.25 pitch lens with 0.46 numerical aperture , 1 mm diameter and 2.58 mm length which is optimized for a wavelength of 630 nm .",
    "the density of the outgoing beam from the optical fiber is increased by a factor of approximately 1000 by using a grin lens .",
    "the return beams are received by another optical fiber and amplified by a si femtowatt photoreceiver with a gain of @xmath20 .",
    "for a fsi system , drifts and vibrations occurring along the optical path during the scan will be magnified by a factor of @xmath21 , where @xmath11 is the average optical frequency of the laser beam and @xmath22 is the scanned frequency range . for the full scan of our laser , @xmath23 .",
    "small vibrations and drift errors that have negligible effects for many optical applications may have a significant impact on a fsi system . a single - frequency vibration may be expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the amplitude , frequency and phase of the vibration , respectively . if @xmath28 is the start time of the scan , eq .",

    "if the path - averaged refractive index of ambient air @xmath34 is known , the measured distance is @xmath35 .",
    "if the measurement window size @xmath36 is fixed and the window used to measure a set of @xmath37 is sequentially shifted , the effects of the vibration will be evident .",
    "we use a set of distance measurements in one scan by successively shifting the fixed - length measurement window one f - p peak forward each time .",
    "the arithmetic average of all measured @xmath37 values in one scan is taken to be the measured distance of the scan ( although more sophisticated fitting methods can be used to extract the central value ) . for a large number of distance measurements @xmath38",
    ", the vibration effects can be greatly suppressed .",
    "of course , statistical uncertainties from fringe and frequency determination , dominant in our current system , can also be reduced with multiple scans .",
    "averaging multiple measurements in one scan , however , provides similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from independent scans , and is faster , more efficient , and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift . in this way",
    ", we can improve the distance accuracy dramatically if there are no significant drift errors during one scan , caused , for example , by temperature variation .",
    "this multiple - distance - measurement technique is called slip measurement window with fixed size , shown in fig.2 .",
    "however , there is a trade off in that the thermal drift error is increased with the increase of @xmath38 because of the larger magnification factor @xmath39 for a smaller measurement window size .    in order to extract the amplitude and frequency of the vibration , another multiple - distance - measurement technique called slip measurement window with fixed start point",
    "is used , as shown in fig.2 . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , if @xmath28 is fixed , the measurement window size is enlarged one f - p peak for each shift , an oscillation of a set of measured @xmath37 values indicates the amplitude and frequency of vibration .",
    "this technique is not suitable for distance measurement because there always exists an initial bias term , from @xmath28 , which can not be determined accurately in our current system .",
    "the typical measurement residual versus the distance measurement number in one scan using the above technique is shown in fig.3(a ) , where the scanning rate was 0.5 nm / s and the sampling rate was 125 ks / s .",
    "measured distances minus their average value for 10 sequential scans are plotted versus number of measurements ( @xmath38 ) per scan in fig.3(b ) . the standard deviations ( rms ) of distance measurements for 10 sequential scans",
    "are plotted versus number of measurements ( @xmath38 ) per scan in fig.3(c ) .",
    "it can be seen that the distance errors decrease with an increase of @xmath38 .",
    "the rms of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is 1.6 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "if @xmath41 and the average value of 1200 distance measurements in each scan is considered as the final measured distance of the scan , the rms of the final measured distances for 10 scans is 41 nm for the distance of 449828.965 @xmath1 , the relative distance measurement precision is 91 ppb .    the standard deviation ( rms ) of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is approximately 1.5 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan for closed box data . by using the multiple - distance - measurement technique , the distance measurement precisions for various closed box data with distances ranging from 10 cm to 70 cm collected in the past year are improved significantly ; precisions of approximately 50 nanometers are demonstrated under laboratory conditions , as shown in table 1 .",
    "all measured precisions listed in table 1 .",
    "are the rms s of measured distances for 10 sequential scans .",
    "two fsi demonstration systems , air fsi and optical fiber fsi , are constructed for extensive tests of multiple - distance - measurement technique , air fsi means fsi with the laser beam transported entirely in the ambient atmosphere , optical fiber fsi represents fsi with the laser beam delivered to the interferometer and received back by single - mode optical fibers .",
    ".distance measurement precisions for various setups using the multiple - distance - measurement technique .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     based on our studies , the slow fluctuations are reduced to a negligible level by using the plastic box and pvc pipes to suppress temperature fluctuations .",
    "the dominant error comes from the uncertainties of the interference fringes number determination ; the fringes uncertainties are uncorrelated for multiple distance measurements . in this case",
    ", averaging multiple distance measurements in one scan provides a similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from multiple independent scans .",
    "but , for open box data , the slow fluctuations are dominant , on the order of few microns in our laboratory .",
    "the measurement precisions for single and multiple distance open - box measurements are comparable , which indicates that the slow fluctuations can not be adequately suppressed by using the multiple - distance - measurement technique .",
    "a dual - laser fsi system@xcite intended to cancel the drift error is currently under study in our laboratory .    in order to test the vibration measurement technique ,",
    "a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) was employed to produce vibrations of the retroreflector .",
    "for instance , the frequency of the controlled vibration source was set to @xmath42 hz with amplitude @xmath43 nanometers .",
    "the magnification factors , distance measurement residuals and corrected measurement residuals for 2000 measurements in one scan are shown in fig.3(d ) , fig.3(e ) and fig.3(f ) , respectively .",
    "the extracted vibration frequencies and amplitudes using this technique , @xmath44  hz , @xmath45 nanometers , agree well with the expectation values .",
    "in addition , vibration frequencies at 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 hz with controlled vibration amplitudes ranging from 9.5 nanometers to 400 nanometers were studied extensively using our current fsi system .",
    "the measured vibrations and expected vibrations all agree well within the 10 - 15% level for amplitudes , 1 - 2% for frequencies , where we are limited by uncertainties in the expectations .",
    "vibration frequencies far below 0.1 hz can be regarded as slow fluctuations , which can not be suppressed by the above analysis techniques .",
    "detailed information about estimation of major error sources for the absolute distance measurement and limitation of our current fsi system is provided elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a dual - laser fsi system has been built in order to reduce drift error and slow fluctuations occuring during the laser scan .",
    "two lasers are operating simultaneously , the two laser beams are coupled into one optical fiber but isolated by using two choppers .",
    "the principle of the dual - laser technique is shown in the following .",
    "for the first laser , the measured distance @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is drift error during the laser scanning . for the second laser , the measured distance @xmath48 .",
    "since the two laser beams travel the same optical path during the same period , the drift errors @xmath49 and @xmath50 should be very comparable . under this assumption",
    ", the true distance can be extracted using the formula @xmath51 , where , @xmath52 , the ratio of magnification factors from two lasers .",
    "the laser beams are isolated by choppers periodically , so only half the fringes are recorded for each laser , degrading the distance measurement precision . missing fringes during chopped intervals for each laser must be recovered through robust interpolation algorithms .",
    "the chopper edge transitions make this interpolation difficult .",
    "several techniques are under study .",
    "one possible silicon tracker alignment system is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the left plot shows lines of sight for alignment in r - z plane of the tracker barrel , the middle plot for alignment in x - y plane of the tracker barrel , the right plot for alignment in the tracker forward region .",
    "red lines / dots show the point - to - point distances need to be measured using fsis .",
    "there are 752 point - to - point distance measurements in total for the alignment system .",
