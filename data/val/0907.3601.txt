    "iii have been obtained for different arbitrary constants @xmath115",
    "@xmath116 one of them is the localized solution ( 22 ) , which is a bell - shapped solitary wave solution .",

    "it is found that the amplitude of the soliton pulse decreases by increasing @xmath122 resulting an increase ( decrease ) of the electron fermi temperature @xmath123 ( quantum diffraction effect @xmath98 ) .",
    "physically , the increase of @xmath123 leads to an increase of the electron fermi energy ( viz .",
    "@xmath124 ) , and as a result the ion fermi energy should decrease to conserve the energy law .",
    "the decrease of the ion fermi energy decreasing the nonlinearity of the system and hence the height of the soliton pulse shrinks",
    ".    it may be interesting to note that for certain values of plasma parameters the solitary pulse convert to an explosive / blowup excitation as shown in fig .",
    "the blowup excitation indicates that an instability in the system can produce due to the effect of the nonlinearity ( which in our case depends on the positron concentration @xmath54 and the quantum statistical effects @xmath125 ) . on the other hand , the magnitude of some quantities ( e.g. temperature , pressure , density , etc . )",
    "leads to prejudice the balance between the dispersion and the nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the amplitude may increase to very high values , which gives rise to increasing the electric potential and then accelerate the moving particles .",
    "it is important to notice that eq .",

    "notice that @xmath136 has to be fulfilled , in order for making the width @xmath137 real .",
    "the numerical analysis in fig .",
    "5 , however , shows that for small positron concentration @xmath54 the dominant situation corresponds to @xmath138 so the double layers may exist . for large positron concentration @xmath122 double layers can not occur , since @xmath139",

    "note that this method gives solitary and explosive excitations described by equation ( 25 ) and periodic excitation described by equation ( 26 ) .",
    "thus , the extended conte s truncation method can not predict the shock formation , which may arise due to the presence of weakly double layers . in the present work ,",
    "we have used generalized expansion method .",
