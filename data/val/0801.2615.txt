    "for example , the overabundance of low - mass x - ray binaries and millisecond pulsars is regarded as consequent upon tidal captures of an environment star by neutron stars , and upon the exchange encounters involving a neutron star @xcite : the smaller relative frequency of red giants in the core is attributed to the deprival of their envelope during close encounters with environment stars @xcite , and blue - stragglers , which are main sequence stars more massive than the turn - off stars , may result from direct collisional coalescence and/or binary merge of two or more stars ( * ? ? ? *",

    "furthermore , there is a longstanding problem of large star - to - star variations in the surface abundances of light elements such as c , n , o , ne , mg and al .",
    "some giants in globular clusters exhibit the anomalous surface abundances that can not be explain in terms of the nucleosynthesis and material mixing in the stars within the current standard framework of stellar evolution ( e.g. , see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "since these anomalies are observed only in globular clusters but not from field giants in the galactic halo , it is natural to search for their origin(s ) in the differences between the environment in the globular clusters and in the galactic halo , and hence , to consider them as a evidence of the star - star interactions .",
    "in fact , @xcite have proposed a scenario for the formation mechanism of these abundance anomalies involving hydrogen shell flashes in red giants , as a result of internal mixing , triggered by the deposition of angular momentum into their envelopes during a close encounter with other stars .",
    "it is demonstrated that this extra - mixing model can reproduce the observed relationship such as correlation and scatter in the anomalous abundances of na and al and the mg - al anti - correlation @xcite .",
    "recently , similar abundance variations are found among unevolved stars of turn - off and sub - giant @xcite .",
    "it is true that the variations and anti - correlations between cn and ch bands have been reported not only for giants but for stars of upper main sequence , which may be taken to suggest the presence of abundance anomalies in unevolved stars @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that these facts refute the evolutionary scenario that the abundance anomalies are produced during the evolution along the giant branch and favor the primordial scenario that the stars were born of gas already subject to the anomalous abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a possible compromise , the recycling scenarios have been proposed that the inhomogeneity is due to the surface pollution by accreting the ejecta of anomalous abundances from the erstwhile agb stars of intermediate masses @xcite , or that the second - generation stars were born from the gas polluted with the ejecta of agb stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the burning at the bottom of convective zone in low metallicity agb stars can produce the observed o - na and mg - al anti - correlations . on the other hand , @xcite cast doubt upon the relevance of agb ejecta to the observed anomalies .",
    "in addition , the scenarios involve serious difficulties both in the mass supply and in the overabundances of cn and s - process elements , attendant with the third dredge - up during the evolution ; the necessary amount of mass ejecta only to cover and disguise the surface convection of giants may well exceed the total envelope mass that can be ejected from the erstwhile agb stars , and the enrichment of s - process elements is never observed @xcite .    for the evolutionary scenario , it can also be argued that the abundance anomalies are printed onto the surface of unevolved stars through the mass transfer during the close encounters with such giants that have already developed the abundance anomalies ; the anomalous abundances are themselves attributed to the deposition of angular momentum into the convective envelope of giants during prior close encounters with environment stars @xcite .",

    "one of the aims of this paper is to investigate whether the orbital angular momentum can be transferred into the envelope of giant from the orbital motion and whether the main sequence star can accrete the envelope mass from giants enough to disguise their surface layer with the accreted matter through star - star interactions .",
    "it is argued that the rotation - induced mixing requires ( differential ) rotation of @xmath6 times the local critical rate from the energetic viewpoint ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "the horizontal branch stars are known to display a bimodal distribution of rotation velocity with the fastest rotators at velocity @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the inclination angle of spin axis ) on the cooler side of horizontal branch where @xmath9 k @xcite .",
    "if we neglect the angular momentum loss during the transition to the horizontal branch , such rapid rotations require the angular momentum corresponding to the rotation rate of an order of @xmath10 at the tip of red giants ( @xmath11 being the critical rotation rate at the surface ) .",

    "we make a detailed analysis of the amounts of energy and angular momentum , transferred from the orbital motion to the oscillation and spin of red giant , and the amount of mass , lost from the red giant and accreted onto the main sequence stars .",

    "accordingly we assume the adiabatic relation for the gas in the envelope of red giants .",
    "in actuality , the code takes into account the change of the entropy due to viscous dissipation , although it may have only a minor effect since we deal with the tidal interactions at large distance , not accompanied by large shock dissipation .",

    "our simulations consist of two steps , i.e. , we first make the initial models of red giants in hydrostatic equilibrium with sph particles , and then , follow the encounter with a main - sequence star .",
    "our red giant models are constructed with a total of 50,000 sph particles of equal mass in the envelope and the core approximated by an appropriate external potential , while the main - sequence star is treated as a point mass .",
    "we start the encounter simulations by placing a red giant and a main sequence at a separation of @xmath34 .",

    "the outer deformations can not keep pace with the motion of perturber as it is accelerated because of the timescale of passage of perturber comparable to that of oscillatory motions and of initially small rotation rate of the red giant .",
    "the lag of tide develops as the perturber approaches to the periastron . later around time of @xmath88 after the periastron passage , the gas streaming out of the red giant starts to accrete onto the main sequence star , now separated by @xmath89 .    at the same time",

    "a density ditch is formed near the interface of upward and downward motions , as seen from the panels in the middle row .",
    "figure  [ fig : eddy - structure ] shows an enlarged picture of the velocity structure when the ditch is formed . since the expanded mass elements gain larger tidal torque than the compressed mass elements , the former overtakes the latter while contracting to form an eddy - like velocity structure of counter - clockwise rotation .",
    "the rotation of lagrangian shells and the resultant deposition of angular momentum into the red giant star due to the tidal torque proceed spectacularly in the surface region , dominated by the non - linear effects .",
    "such features can no longer be the case in the linear theory , although the mass involved in the non - linear deformations is small , as seen from the movement of open squares .",
    "the similar non - linear effects are reported by @xcite , who study tidal encounters between a polytropic star and a black hole , although they assume large periastron distance , and hence , the deformations remain nearly axial - symmetric without mass transfer , which is different from our case .",
    "this model illustrates an example that ends with the formation of a bound system after the encounter , as seen from table  [ tab : model = alpha ] . in model e8rg1 with the same parameter but for the smaller shear viscosity of @xmath31 ,",

    "[ fig : snapshota8rg1 ] , and the effect of smaller viscosity is plainly discernible only in deeper ditch that develops after 6 time units .",
    "accordingly , there are only small differences in the results in table  [ tab : model = alpha ] .",
    "this suggests that the transfer of energy and angular momentum is attributed solely to the phase - lag of the deformations , dynamically generated in the red giant envelope behind the perturber passage .",
    "the interactions to exchange these quantities predominantly occur near the periastron passage of the smallest separation while the deformations are still growing . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of viscosity become important only after the deformations contract to generate a strong shear near the stellar surface , and hence , the value of viscosity hardly affects the transfer characteristics .",

    "the non - linear deformations in the outer shells of red giant are weaker than those of the model of closer encounter @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshota8rg1 ] . because of slower angular velocity of perturber , the tidal bulge stretched out toward the perturber is relatively slimmer to form a chimney like structure .",
    "the ditch and the eddy - like structure , generated on the surface , are also in smaller scales .",
    "the encounter with a less massive perturber results in smaller transfer characteristics , a part of which is due to a larger periastron passing time , @xmath75 , when compared at the same periastron distance .",
    "model c6rg1 of @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) exhibits a similar chimney like structure as model b8rg1 of the massive perturber with the same periastron distance , but the surface deformations are slightly smaller because of larger @xmath75 .",
    "the overall transfer characteristics lie between those of two massive perturber models , model b8rg1 with @xmath96 and model c8rg1 with @xmath97 .",
    "the encounters with red giants at later evolutionary stages are exemplified by the models of the larger radius , @xmath40 .",
    "when models with the same encounter closeness parameter @xmath75 are compared , the overall characteristics of interaction , i.e. , the structure of mode oscillations , the development of deformations and the accreted process , are very similar in all models , despite of the large difference in the physical distance scales .",
    "this is attributable to the nature of envelope structure of red giants , i.e. , to the self - similar density structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : redgiant ] .",
    "the resultant transfer characteristics also turn out to be very similar when we subtract the effects of smaller envelope mass .",
    "the overall features of gas streaming are as follows .",
    "for small periastron distances as in these encounters , the non - linear effects in the tidal interactions are important and the surface density profile becomes highly asymmetric in the outer shells of red giants . as the perturber approaches to periastron , the tidal bulge is exited in the red giant and elongated , first directed to the perturber . since it can not catch up with the motion of the perturber because of initially slow rotation , gas particles from the surface of red giant chases after the perturber to gain the energy and angular momentum .",
    "some of them eventually get captured by the gravitational potential of the perturber after periastron passage . on the other hand ,",
    "most of gas involved in the tidal bulge falls back onto the red giant with gained angular momentum , which produces a non - linear feature of eddy - like structure in the surface region . even in the case of binary formations ,",
    "the orbit is highly eccentric , and hence , as two stars go away from each other the tidal bulge becomes slender .",
    "the transfer of orbital energy and angular momentum to the red giant is characterized by the following three time - scales ; ( i ) the periastron passing time scale of main sequence star , @xmath98 , which is related to the variation of the external perturbing force : ( ii ) the dynamical time - scale of the envelope of red giant , @xmath99 , which is related to the stellar oscillations in response to the external force : ( iii ) the viscous time - scale in the envelope of red giant , @xmath100 , which is caused by the convective eddy in the red giant envelope . in our case , @xmath101 . for a slowly rotating red giant , the tidal bulge tends to fall behind the accelerated motion of perturber , and hence , a tidal lag is formed dynamically to carry the energy and angular momentum from the orbital motion into the oscillatory motions and rotation of red giant envelope .",
    "the viscosity plays secondary roles in the transfer of energy and angular momentum , as seen in table  [ tab : model = alpha ] .",
    "the accreted mass depends little on the assumption of viscosity either .",
    "furthermore , we see that the accreted mass takes nearly the same values regardless of the difference in the red giant models when compared among the models of the similar values of @xmath102 ) , instead of the encounter closeness parameter @xmath75 .",
    "this is indicative that the mass accretion is determined by the same process of energy deposition process .",
    "figure  [ fig : omegashell - time ] shows the time variations of angular velocity , @xmath103 , relative to its keplerian angular velocity , @xmath104 , averaged over the gas particles in the three lagrangian rings on the orbital plane , initially located at the shells which contain the mass of red giant ( including the core mass ) by 95% , 90% , and 80% , respectively .",

    "accordingly , the turnover of rotation velocity delays in the outer shell , and at the same time , the mean rotation velocity of oscillation increases in prograde direction , reflecting the injection of angular momentum due to the tidal torque , which is stronger in outer shells .",
    "the amplitudes and mean - values of oscillations are greater for closer encounter . between the different red giant models with the same closeness parameter @xmath75 , the model with",
    "the larger radius entails smaller variations in the rotation rate , normalized with respect to the characteristic rotation rate , @xmath110 ; this is true even if we take into account the fact that the shell of the same mass fraction is 50% deeper in the envelope because of smaller envelope mass .",
    "it should be noted however that the net amount of angular momentum transferred is larger , though slightly , for the red giant model of larger radius because of larger critical angular momentum ( @xmath111 .    as for the effects of viscosity on the time variations of @xmath103 , the largest one appears in the difference in the minimum value after the periastron passage",

    "the time of minimum @xmath103 coincides nearly with the time of the strongest eddy in figs .",
    "[ fig : snapshota8rg1 ] .",
    "stronger shear produced by the eddy - like structure in turn enhances the dissipation and inward transport of angular momentum ; in panels a and a@xmath112 , we see the amplitudes of oscillations in the outer two shells get smaller in the second and later cycles for the models of smaller viscosity , though the overall similarity holds , in particular , in the shifts of mean - values of oscillations .",

    "the outermost layer is first accelerated and pulled most outwards to run after the perturber of the angular velocity , @xmath76 , at periastron passage ( @xmath114 around the time @xmath115 ) .",
    "then the deposited angular momentum is redistributed gradually into the interior . by @xmath116 ,",
    "the most of interior up to the radius @xmath117 tends to rotate uniformly while there remains differential rotation in the outer expanded layer of lower density . for the smaller viscosity parameter of @xmath118 , the viscous process works slightly more slowly and a uniform rotation",
    "is reached only in the interior of @xmath119 by @xmath116 with stronger differential rotation in the outer shells .",

    "@xcite suggest that the different modes of helium mixing mechanism may result according to when the stars undergo the close encounter and the deposition of angular momentum on the rgb and influence the horizontal branch morphology ; the injection of angular momentum may invoke hydrodynamical instabilities due to differential rotation and invokes turbulent mixing to trigger the hydrogen - flash driven deep mixing , and the resultant helium enrichment in the envelope accelerates the evolution of rgb .",
    "the stars that experience the helium enrichment at an earlier epoch on the rgb have a smaller mass of helium core and hence , located on redder side of hb and those with later mixing epoch shifts to blue - ward : on the other hand , if the stars experience the close encounter near the tip of rgb , the helium - flash driven mixing , rather than the hydrogen - flash driven deep mixing , takes places and causes the largest decrease of helium core so that the stars are situated at the reddest end on the hb . if the stars experience close encounter at an earlier stage of rgb , then , they become slow rotators , due to angular momentum loss through mass loss on the rgb , and hence , settle on redder side of horizontal branch , and the stars , if experiencing it at later stage of rgb , become faster rotators and settle on bluer side .",
    "finally , the stars , which undergo close encounters very close to the tip of rgb , become the fastest hb rotators , located on redder - most side of the branch .",
    "the close encounters at @xmath242 can explain the fastest rotation rates observed from hb stars of @xmath243 if the angular momentum is conserved during the contraction from the rgb to the hb . while the pristine angular momentum is lost effectively for such low mass stars , such fast rotation as observed for hb stars may be expected also from the synchronization of red giants in the binary systems of separations ( more than a several au ) , and yet , it is difficult for such binaries to survive without suffering encounters in the dense stellar environment of globular clusters ( see below eq .  [ [ eq : tau - enc ] ] ) . in other word , we may take the existence of hb stars of these fastest rotations as an evidence that such close encounters as @xmath240 take place in these clusters .",

    "in addition to the mass segregation , the gravo - thermal oscillations of star clusters , which has been proposed by @xcite and confirmed by n - body simulation @xcite , may influence the rate ; since the interactions are expected to occur in the evolutional stage near the high density peak , it is necessary to investigate in a correct manner how deeply and how long such a high density state reaches and lasts to affect the encounter rates .    for the encounter with the red giants of later stages , the pollution of main sequence stars are possible even when the two stars fly apart after the encounters . for the encounter that ends in the formation of binary",
    ", it depends on the fate of two stars whether the abundance anomalies imprinted onto the companions are observable or not , and it is necessary to pursue the details of evolution of tidally captured binaries .",
    "there are many effects to influence the binary evolution , such as the spin - up and mode damping rates of red giant after the encounter , the mass transfer to the companion at subsequent periastron passages ( ex . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass loss from the bound system , and also the expansion of red giant as it ascends the red giant branch . in addition , we should also take into account the tidal interactions of formed binaries with the environment stars .",
    "it is conceivable as the destination of tidally captured binary that either one component is liberated through the exchange encounter with a third body , or the two stars eventually coalesce as a result of roche lobe overflow .",
    "the possibility of the exchange event depends on the evolution timescale of giants and the encounter timescale ; since the exchange encounter rate is proportional nearly to a semi - major axis of a binary under the assumption of point mass limit @xcite , then the former is expected to occur more frequently . accordingly ,",
    "if tidal capture of two body encounters can contribute the modification of stellar populations , then , the exchange encounters follow at larger rates and make greater contributions .",
    "this increase in the encounter rates with red giant in the binary may affect the statistics of the main sequence stars with the abundance anomalies .",
    "further , through the exchange encounters , the red giants and horizontal branch stars , now losing the mass due to the mass loss and becoming lighter than the heaviest main sequence stars , can be ejected from the binary systems to fly apart as single stars .    in summary",
    ", the enhancement of tidal interactions , necessary to explain the observed abundance anomalies , is expected to be provided by the formation of high density core due to the gravo - thermal oscillations and by the mass segregations which enlarge the fractions of stars of the upper mass end in the core .",
    "the proper understandings of these effects wait for n - body simulations of globular clusters with the stars of multi - mass spectra taken into account since star - star interactions as studied in the present work will play a critical role . in these studies of dynamical evolution of stellar systems , the formulae for the transfer of energy , angular momentum , and accreted mass derived in the present work serve the purpose for incorporation these effects into the simulations .",
    "it is also necessary to pursue the binary evolution and accurately explore the fate of red giants and subsequent horizontal branch stars with the interactions with the environment stars taken into account .",

    "<S> we investigate the tidal interactions of a red giant with a main sequence in the dense stellar core of globular clusters by smoothed particle hydrodynamics method . </S>",
    "<S> two models of @xmath0 red giant with the surface radii @xmath1 and @xmath2 are used with 0.6 or @xmath3 main sequence star treated as a point mass . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that even for the wide encounters that two stars fly apart , the angular momentum of orbital motion can be deposited into the red giant envelope to such an extent as to trigger rotational mixing and to explain the fast rotation observed for the horizontal branch stars , and also that sufficient mass can be accreted on the main sequence stars to disguise their surface convective zone with the matter from the red giant envelope . on the basis of the present results , we discuss the parameter dependence of these transfer characteristics with non - linear effects taken into account , and derive fitting formulae to give the amounts of energy and angular momentum deposited into the red giant and of mass accreted onto the perturber as functions of stellar parameters and the impact parameter of encounter . </S>",
    "<S> these formulae are applicable to the encounters not only of the red giants but also of the main sequence stars , and useful in the study of the evolution of stellar systems with the star - star interactions taken into account . </S>"
