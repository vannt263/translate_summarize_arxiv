    "the problem of single hole binding by an attractive potential in the t - j model is of fundamental importance . in the physics of doped mott insulatoris and",
    "in particular in the physics of the cuprate superconductors , the system play a role analogous to the that played by the hydrogen atom in atomic physics .",
    "we have in mind , for example , la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 with a la ion replaced by sr .",
    "alternatively it may be ca@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 with a ca ion replaced by na .",
    "an important point is that the attractive center ( sr ion in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 or na ion in ca@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 ) sits in the center of a square of four cu sites .",
    "this means that the attractive potential itself does not break the local square lattice symmetry .",
    "there are various aspects of the bound state problem : the symmetry / parity of the bound state , the structure of the spin fabric , and in the end the particular value of the binding energy .",
    "we argue that the symmetry issues are the most important ones .",
    "there have been several studies of the bound state problem .",
    "these are mainly small cluster exact dioganalizations  @xcite .",
    "a generic limitation of this approach is the small cluster size and as a consequence sensitivity to boundary conditions . in spite of this limitation",
    "a very important observation has been made already in the early work  @xcite : the ground state is almost degenerate with another state that has opposite parity .",
    "dependent on the parameters of the model , the ground state belongs either to the two dimensional e - representation of the @xmath2 symmetry group of the hamiltonian or to the @xmath3 representation  @xcite .",
    "however , there is always a very low - lying excitation of opposite parity .",
    "a semiclassical solution of the bound state problem was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite generally a semiclassical approach can be justified in the limit of a large radius of the bound state . according to the semiclassical solution the bound state generates a long range ( @xmath4 ) spiral distortion of the spin fabric as it is shown in fig.[h ] .",
    "the figure shows staggered spins .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ h ] that the semiclassical solution does not have a definite parity .",
    "it does not fit in any representation of the symmetry group of the square lattice .",
    "so the solution spontaneously breaks the local square lattice symmetry . on the other hand",
    "it is impossible to have a spontaneous violation of an exact symmetry of the hamiltonian in a finite system .",
    "therefore , the exact parameter that justifies the semiclassical solution  @xcite has remained unclear .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to elucidate this parameter and hence to elucidate the physical meaning of the solution with violation of exact symmetries .",
    "we show that the physics of this system is similar to the physics of a hydrogen atom in an external electric field .",
    "the parameter that justifies the semiclassical solution is the small splitting between states of opposite parity .",
    "the splitting scales as the binding energy squared and hence it is infinitesimally small for a shallow bound state .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we explain the analogy with the hydrogen atom .",
    "in particular , we consider the conditions when a long range tail of the dipole electric field can be generated by the atom . in section iii",
    "we briefly review known properties of an unbound single hole moving in the antiferromagnetic background of the @xmath5 model .",
    "section iv addresses the limiting case of very strong binding .",
    "here we present results of exact diagonalizations for the 4@xmath64 cluster embedded in an antiferromagnetic background . in sections v and",
    "vi we consider the weak binding limit and discuss symmetry properties of the bound states .",
    "section vii addresses the parity breaking and generation of the local spin spiral . in section viii",
    "we exclude a possibility of the local charge density wave ( cdw ) formation .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section ix .",
    "consider a hydrogen atom in the ground 1s state .",
    "the size is about one bohr radius , @xmath7 .",
    "since the atom is neutral the electric field at distances @xmath8 decays exponentially .",
    "let us consider the same atom in the @xmath9 state , either the positive parity 2s - state or negative parity 2p - state .",
    "importantly , they are degenerate . because of the degeneracy an infinitesimally small _ external _ electric field , @xmath10 , will mix the opposite parity states @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the state with zero projection of the angular momentum in the direction of the external electric field .",
    "the state ( [ 2sp ] ) possesses a static electric dipole moment @xmath13 .",
    "hence a static dipole electric potential and a static electric field are induced outside the atom , @xmath8 @xmath14 due to the small but nonzero energy splitting @xmath15 between 2s- and 2p - states ( lamb shift ) , one needs to apply a small but finite external field , @xmath16 , to create the mixed state ( [ 2sp ] ) and hence to induce the dipole field ( [ fe ] ) .",
    "importantly , the induced field ( [ fe ] ) is much larger than @xmath17 .",
    "one can also look at the problem from another point of view .",
    "consider two hydrogen atoms each in the @xmath9 state .",
    "the attractive potential between the atoms has two distinct regimes depending on the distance @xmath18 between the atoms .",
    "the characteristic distance @xmath19 is defined by the condition @xmath20 . if @xmath21 the potential is @xmath22 in this regime the electric dipole fields of the two atoms lock to each other . at @xmath23",
    "the interaction scales as @xmath24 , this is the usual van der waals regime that is due to fluctuating dipoles",
    ". we will argue below that the dipole distortion of the spin fabric in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) t - j model shown in fig .",
    "[ h ] is fully analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ fe]),([vat ] ) .",
    "the power in the 2d case is different , @xmath25 .",
    "a more important difference is that in the t - j model the ground state itself is a parity doublet .",
    "the splitting in the doublet is parametrically small at small binding energy , it scales as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the binding energy .",
    "the 2d @xmath5 model was suggested two decades ago to describe the essential low - energy physics of high-@xmath28 cuprates  @xcite . in",
    "its extended version , this model includes additional hopping matrix elements @xmath29 and @xmath30 to 2nd and 3rd - nearest cu neighbors .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath31 model on the square cu lattice has the form:@xmath32here , @xmath33 is the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath34 @xmath35 at site @xmath36 of the square lattice , @xmath37 indicates 1st- , @xmath38 2nd- , and @xmath39 3rd - nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the number density operator .",
    "in addition to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) there is the constraint of no double occupancy , which accounts for strong electron correlations .",
    "the values of the parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ htj ] ) for cuprates are known from neutron scattering , raman spectroscopy , and ab - initio calculations .",
    "for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 the values are  @xcite : @xmath42 hereafter we set @xmath43 , hence we measure energies in units of @xmath44 . in the present work we study generic properties of the extended @xmath5 model .",
    "therefore we will vary parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 in a broad range .    at zero doping ( no holes ) , the @xmath45-@xmath44 model is equivalent to the heisenberg model and describes the mott insulator la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the removal of a single electron from this mott insulator , or in other words the injection of a hole , allows the charge carrier to propagate .",
    "the properties of a free single hole in the @xmath45-@xmath44 model are very well studied numerically : see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . at values of parameters corresponding to the cuprates",
    "the dispersion of the hole dressed by magnetic quantum fluctuations has minima at the ` nodal points ' @xmath48 see fig .",
    "[ valley ] .",
    "the typical value of the quasiparticle residue at these points is @xmath49 .",
    "by changing the sign of @xmath46 and @xmath47 one can shift the dispersion minima to the ` antinodal points ' @xmath50 and @xmath50 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the electron doped cuprates .",
    "we will argue below that the properties of the shallow bound state are most interesting and rich in the regime when the minima of the dispersion are at the nodal points .",
    "this is the regime which we consider in the present work .",
    "the dispersion of the hole dressed by magnetic quantum fluctuations is quadratic in the vicinity of @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "we set the lattice spacing to unity , 3.81@xmath54 1 . in eq.([eq ] ) @xmath55 is directed along the nodal direction and @xmath56 is directed along the face of the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) , see fig .",

    "( [ jtt ] ) the inverse masses are  @xcite , @xmath57 .",
    "it is instructive to consider also the weak coupling limit @xmath58 , @xmath59 . in this limit",
    "the quasiparticle residue is close to unity , @xmath60 , while the dispersion reads  @xcite @xmath61",
    "we include a site - dependant potential attraction to an impurity , @xmath62 a very important point is that the potential @xmath63 is symmetric around the center of a plaquette , see fig .",

    "repulsion for electrons @xmath64 corresponds to hole attraction .    .",

    "the first possibility is the short range potential which is nonzero only at four nearest sites , see fig .",
    "[ sb ] , @xmath65 where @xmath66 runs over four nearest sites .",
    "the second possibility is the long range coulomb interaction @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a dimensionless charge which sits at a distance one lattice spacing above the plane .",
    "let us consider first the local potential ( [ usr ] ) in the strong coupling limit , @xmath69 .",
    "the solution of the bound state problem in this limit is qualitatively clear .",
    "there are degenerate states with @xmath70 . at each value of @xmath71",
    "there are states of positive and negative parity .",
    "let us consider the lowest bound state in each parity sector .",
    "note that there is only one lowest state in each sector .",
    "this is contrary to the common wisdom that the negative parity states are doubly degenerate due to the symmetry of the square lattice ( e - representation of c@xmath72 ) .",
    "the point is that we consider hole binding on the spin background with spontaneously broken su(2 ) symmetry . in combination with the impurity potential",
    "this breaks the symmetry of the square lattice and hence destroys degeneracy of the negative parity states .",
    "binding energies of the lowest bound states are @xmath73 here the sign @xmath74 denotes the parity of the bound state .",
    "we define the binding energy @xmath27 in the standard way : this is the energy of the bound state taken with respect to the minimum energy of a free hole .",
    "so @xmath27 is always negative . to find the parity splitting @xmath15 in the strong coupling limit we have performed exact diagonalizations of the @xmath75 model on the 16 site cluster shown in fig .",
    "we have already pointed out that it is qualitatively important to perform the diagonalization on the state with spontaneously broken su(2 ) symmetry .",

    "the case u=0 certainly does not correspond to any binding .",

    "our numerical results qualitatively agree with those of previous publications  @xcite .",

    "the first and second observations indicate that the bound state is close to the parity degeneracy in the case of the nodal minima of the free hole dispersion .",
    "this is why in the present work we concentrate on this case .",
    "according to the third observation the parity splitting is rapidly decreasing when the radius of the bound state increases . in following section",
    "we consider shallow bound states of large radius to confirm these conclusions .",
    "let us look at the binding problem in the weak coupling limit , @xmath87 , @xmath88 . in this case",
    "the shallow bound state can be built with a hole either from the a- or the b - valley of the dispersion , see fig .",
    "[ valley ] .",
    "hence the bound state has the valley index and the corresponding wave function reads @xmath89 where @xmath90 shows the valley and @xmath91 shows the magnetic sublattice along which the hole is propagating , @xmath92 is position on this sublattice .",
    "note that here we have in mind a real propagation .",
    "there are also virtual hoppings of the hole to the opposite sublattice .",
    "these virtual hoppings lead to formation of the free hole dispersion that was discussed in section iii .",
    "the z - projection of the hole spin is @xmath93 .",
    "the oscillating exponential dependence @xmath94 in ( [ psis ] ) is due to the momentum @xmath95 that corresponds to the valley minimum .",
    "the very smooth function @xmath96 exponentially decaying at infinity is due to the hole binding to the potential . in the case of the coulomb field , eq.([uc ] ) , the wave function is  @xcite @xmath97 the components @xmath98 and @xmath99 in eq.([chic ] ) are projections of @xmath100 on directions 1 and 2 corresponding to the particular valley , see fig .",
    "[ valley ] . in the case of the local attraction eq.([usr ] ) , the wave function is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the bessel function of the second kind .",
    "note that for both eqs.([chic ] ) and ( [ chil ] ) the root mean square radius of the bound state scales as @xmath103 it is easy to see that a change of sign of @xmath104 leads only to a common phase factor in the wave function ( [ psis ] ) , so this is the same wave function .",
    "there are only two distinct possibilities : the a - minimum , @xmath105 , and the b - minimum , @xmath106 .",
    "thus , there are two degenerate quantum states for each value of @xmath71 .",
    "we put the potential center at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "then , according to eq .",
    "( [ psis ] ) and fig .",
    "[ sb ] ( in this case one has to remove the cluster boundary and extend the figure up to infinity ) the @xmath107 wave functions read @xmath108 where both @xmath109 and @xmath110 are integer and even .",
    "similarly the @xmath111 wave functions are @xmath112 we put an additional factor @xmath113 in @xmath114 and @xmath115 to make these wave functions real . under the parity operation @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the function @xmath96 does not change .",
    "therefore parities of states ( [ psis1 ] ) and ( [ psis2 ] ) are determined by the phase factors , and the parities are @xmath118 thus , in the leading weak coupling limit approximation , @xmath88 , the ground state is a degenerate parity doublet for each value of @xmath71 .",
    "this explains why values of the parity splitting presented in table i by large font are very small .",
    "the next section is addressed to the mechanism that lifts the exact parity degeneracy .",
    "in the present section we demonstrate that in the subleading weak binding approximation , @xmath88 , the parity degeneracy of the ground state obtained in the previous section is lifted : the parity splitting scales as @xmath26 . because of this scaling the splitting is very small compared to the binding energy , @xmath119 .",
    "signs of the hole wave functions @xmath114 and @xmath120 given by eqs .",
    "( [ psis1 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ wf ] .    in this case",
    "the hole is moving on the ` up ' sublattice . to avoid misunderstanding",
    "we stress that there is only one hole , we do not show spins up in fig .",
    "[ wf ] just to make the figure less busy .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates that the states have opposite parities and different diagonal momenta , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ wf ] that the difference in energy between states @xmath114 and @xmath120 arises due to diagonal hopping of the hole in the vicinity of the potential , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the effective diagonal hopping that is due to the bare @xmath77 and also due to higher orders in @xmath45 , see e.g. eq.([std ] )",
    ". moreover , the splitting can not be just proportional to @xmath125 ; the splitting must contain a gradient of @xmath126 because there is no a splitting for free hole propagation when @xmath127 .",
    "the first power of the gradient in the energy splitting is forbidden by parity .",
    "thus we come to the following formula for the energy splitting @xmath128 the formula contains the second power of gradient , so it is allowed by parity . having in mind eqs.([chic ] ) , ( [ chil ] ) and using eq.([dd2 ] ) we conclude that @xmath129 we stress that this formula follows from general symmetry considerations based on degeneracy of the free hole dispersion at the four nodal points @xmath130 .",
    "the symmetry arguments certainly do not allow to determine a coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ dd3 ] ) .",
    "however , they do allow us to determine the scaling law given by ( [ dd3 ] ) .",
    "it is helpful to support the general considerations presented in the previous paragraph by a numerical calculation .",
    "such a calculation in the regime @xmath131 is hardly possible .",
    "however , in the regime @xmath132 the calculation can be performed using results of ref .",
    "@xcite summarized in eq.([std ] ) .",
    "according to the results the spin quantum fluctuations can be integrated out and the hole propagation on the sublattice up is described by the following effective hamiltonian @xmath133 here @xmath134 is the holon creation operator on the site @xmath36 ; all the sites @xmath36 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 belong to the sublattice up . to be specific we consider here the coulomb attraction ( [ hu ] ) , ( [ uc ] ) .",
    "the attractive interaction written in terms of holon operators reads @xmath137 where @xmath63 is given by eq.([uc ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath138 can be easily diagonalized numerically on a very large cluster .",
    "results of diagonalizations for 30@xmath630 cluster with @xmath139 , @xmath140 and for three values of the dimensionless charge @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are shown in fig .",
    "[ chi2 ] .    in this figure",
    "we show the holon probability distribution for shallow bound states , and in the legends we present values of the rms radius , @xmath144 ; the binding energy , @xmath27 ; and the ratio @xmath145 . according to the data in fig .",
    "[ chi2 ] , in the limit @xmath88 the parity splitting @xmath15 is decaying even slightly faster than @xmath146 .",
    "most likely the small deviation from the expected @xmath147 scaling is due to the finite cluster size .",
    "we have also checked that the splitting @xmath15 vanishes at @xmath148 . altogether",
    "the numerical results presented in fig .",
    "[ chi2 ] confirm the scaling law given by eq.([dd3 ] ) .",
    "the conclusion of the present section is that the ground state parity splitting is decaying @xmath149 when the binding energy is decreasing , @xmath88 , @xmath150 . to estimate the coefficient in this dependence at @xmath151 one can refer to results of exact numerical diagonalizations presented in table i.",
    "it is known experimentally that in very lightly doped la@xmath152sr@xmath153cuo@xmath1 a hole binding energy to sr ion is about @xmath154 mev , the bound state ` wave vector ' is @xmath155 , and the rms radius of the bound state is @xmath156 , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite estimates based on results derived in sections iv and vi show that the expected parity splitting of the ground state in this case is a small fraction of 1 mev .",
    "therefore , parity breaking is practically a zero mode of the system .",
    "according to the discussion in previous sections a single hole bound state in the t - j model always has a definite value of the spin projection on the direction of staggered magnetization , @xmath157 , and it always has a definite parity .",
    "dependent on parameters , @xmath45 , @xmath77 , etc , the ground state parity can be positive or negative , but it is definite .",

    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "now , following the 2s-2p hydrogen atom scenario discussed in section ii , we can mix the opposite parity states by a weak external perturbation .",
    "there are two possibilities : 1)mixing of states with different @xmath71 that belong to the same hole pocket , 2)mixing of states with the same @xmath71 that belong to different hole pockets . in the present section",
    "we consider the first possibility that leads to formation of a local spin spiral shown in fig .",
    "the second possibility could lead to formation of a cdw .",
    "however , we show in the following section that this possibility is energetically unfavorable .",
    "thus , let us mix the opposite parity states with different @xmath71 that belong to the same pocket .",

    "the spins are directed along the z - axis in the spin space , @xmath160 .",
    "the uniform spin twist means that the spin direction @xmath161 rotates around a unit vector @xmath162 that is orthogonal to the z - axis .",

    "the corresponding interaction energy is @xmath174 if the interaction energy is larger than the parity doublet splitting , @xmath175 the bound state wave function becomes a mixture of the opposite parity states @xmath176 with the phase @xmath177 determined by the condition @xmath178 .",
    "thus , the uniform spin twist q is completely analogous to a weak uniform electric filed @xmath17 applied to hydrogen atom as has been discussed in section ii .",
    "the wave function mixing ( [ cbb ] ) is analogous to the mixing ( [ 2sp ] ) .",

    "estimates based on values of @xmath15 obtained in sections iv , vi show that for bound states with radius @xmath179 the value of the crossover distance is @xmath189 .",
    "so practically eq.([vv ] ) is always valid . to restore dimension in ( [ vv ] )",
    "one has to recall that @xmath190mev , @xmath191 while dimensionless @xmath18 is expressed in units of lattice spacing .",
    "we consider now a possible mixing of the bound states with the same @xmath71 that belong to different hole pockets .",
    "since the spin is not changed there is no deformation of the spin fabric , and a usual electrostatic potential can mix the states .",
    "however , the spatial wave functions from different pockets differ by momentum @xmath192 , or @xmath193 . therefore , to generate the mixing the electrostatic potential must be modulated at this momentum .",
    "so , the mechanism can produce a cdw with the wave vector @xmath194 .",
    "let @xmath195 is a fourier component of the external electrostatic potential .",
    "the component interacts with the corresponding matrix element of charge density @xmath196^{3/2 } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have used here eqs.([psis1 ] ) and ( [ chic ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath197 , this allows to evaluate the integral in ( [ cd ] ) analytically .",
    "numerical integration shows that eq.([cd ] ) is approximately valid even with non - equal inverse masses .",
    "for example at @xmath198 the deviation from the analytical expression eq.([cd ] ) does not exceed a few per cent .",
    "we proceed now directly to the coulomb interaction between two holes bound to two different impurities separated by large distance @xmath18 .",
    "since the system is two - dimensional the electrostatic potential created by a charge density component @xmath199 is @xmath200 therefore the coulomb interaction energy between two spatially separated bound states reads @xmath201 note that the sign is negative because the system always tunes up the mixing phases to reduce energy .",
    "evaluation of ( [ ec ] ) with account of ( [ cd ] ) is straightforward . in the limit",
    "@xmath202 the result reads @xmath203 here @xmath183 is dimensionless and we put the factor @xmath204 to restore the dimension of energy ( @xmath205 is the elementary charge , @xmath206 is the lattice spacing and @xmath207 is the dielectric constant ) .",
    "now we can compare the cdw coulomb interaction ( [ ec1 ] ) with the spin - spiral interaction ( [ vv ] ) . in lsco the ` wave vector ' of the bound state",
    "is @xmath208 , see ref .",
    "@xcite let us take @xmath209 that corresponds to the average distance between bound states at the doping level @xmath210 . with these parameters",
    "one finds @xmath211mev while @xmath212mev .",
    "thus formation of the cdw is energetically unfavorable compared to formation of the spin spiral .",
    "we have considered a single hole injected into a two dimensional mott insulator on a square lattice with a long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the system is described by the extended t - j model .",
    "an important point is that minima of the hole dispersion are at nodal points @xmath213 .",
    "the hole is bound by an impurity potential .",
    "the impurity is located at a center of the lattice plaquette , so the potential itself does not break the local square lattice symmetry .",
    "\\1 ) all bound states have definite parity and they are doubly degenerate with respect to the spin projection on the axis of the staggered magnetization , @xmath70 .",
    "2)the ground state always has a very close state of opposite parity ( parity doublet )",
    ". for shallow bound states splitting within the parity doublet scales as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is binding energy .",
    "3)for shallow bound states the parity splitting @xmath15 is extremely small .",
    "therefore an extremely small external twist of the spin fabric breaks parity .",
    "the breaking creates a long range spiral distortion of the spin fabric .",
    "the breaking can be also created by another impurity ; in this case the local spirals of two impurities lock each other .",
    "4)the bound state parity breaking in the t - j model is very similar to the parity breaking within the @xmath214 parity doublet of the hydrogen atom .",
