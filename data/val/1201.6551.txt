    "the starting point of this work goes back to 2007 when persi diaconis visited our laboratory jean - alexandre dieudonn in nice . at that time",
    ", he explained that determinantal processes were emerging in many areas and that there was no statistical procedure to estimate their distributions .",
    "almost five years later , it still seems to be the case .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to contribute to the study of these processes .",
    "our aim is not only to focus on statistical estimation but also to discuss some related problems .",
    "for example , how the class @xmath3 of all determinantal densities can be parametrized ?",
    "is there an identifiable way of doing it ?",
    "another natural question , at least for a statistician , is to understand how the elements of @xmath3 can be approximated . are there some specific parametric sets that should be used to approximate the densities lying in @xmath3 ?",
    "if so , what can be said about the approximation properties of these sets ? finally , given @xmath2 independent copies of a determinantal process @xmath1 , we propose an estimator of the density @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",
    "we establish non - asymptotic risk bounds for our estimator and deduce uniform rates of convergence over classes of @xmath0 of interest .",
    "it turns out that our estimation strategy is robust with respect to the assumption that @xmath1 is a determinantal process .",
    "this means that the risk bounds we get are not only valid when @xmath0 belongs to the class @xmath3 but also when @xmath0 is close enough to it ( in the hellinger distance ) .",
    "our approach is based on @xmath4-estimation as introduced by birg  @xcite . more precisely , we start with a suitable family of models , which typically consists of compact sets of densities , and the role of which is to provide a good approximation of the elements of @xmath3 . then , we discretize these models .",
    "this results in a family of points @xmath5 of @xmath3 and we finally use the data in order to select a suitable point among the @xmath6 . the way we select this point , which provides our estimator of @xmath0 ,",
    "is based on robust testing and aims at finding an element among the @xmath6 which is as close as possible to the target density @xmath0 .",
    "we establish non - asymptotic risk bounds for our estimator and show how they depend on the approximation properties of the models we started from . under _ a posteriori _",
    "assumptions on @xmath0 and for a suitable choice of the models , we specify this bounds and derive rates of convergence .    for an introduction to determinantal processes ,",

    "part of the popularity of determinantal processes comes from the fact that they naturally arise in the study of the eigenvalues of large random matrices .",
