    "<S> we compute the three - loop qcd corrections to the decoupling constant for @xmath0 which relates the minimal supersymmetric standard model to quantum chromodynamics with five or six active flavours . </S>",

    "<S> we furthermore derive a low - energy theorem which allows the calculation of the coefficient function of the effective higgs boson - gluon operator from the decoupling constant . </S>",
