    "calculation of inner shell ionization cross sections by proton and ion impact is an important component of the simulation of pixe ( particle induced x - ray emission ) and the analysis of experimental pixe spectra .",
    "the ecpssr ( energy - loss coulomb perturbed stationary state relativistic ) @xcite theory with its variants is regarded as the standard approach for cross section calculations in the domain of pixe applications , which typically concern the energy range up to a few tens mev and the whole range of elements in the periodic system .",
    "it provides inner shell ionization cross sections for pixe analysis codes such as geopixe @xcite , gupix @xcite , pixan @xcite , pixef @xcite , pixyklm @xcite , sapix @xcite , and ttpixan @xcite , and for specialized pixe simulation codes @xcite .",
    "several cross section models for the computation of inner shell ionization by proton and @xmath0 particle impact are available in a package for pixe simulation @xcite released in geant4 @xcite 9.4 version ; they include models based on the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) @xcite , the ecpssr model in a number of variants and a collection of empirical models , deriving from fits to experimental data .",
    "the pwba and ecpssr cross section models ( with variants ) exploit tabulations produced by the isics @xcite code for k , l and m shells , which have been assembled in a data library @xcite publicly distributed by rsicc ( radiation safety information computational center at the oak ridge national laboratory ) . a new version of isics and an entirely new code for the calculation of ecpssr cross sections ( with variants ) , ercs08 @xcite , have become available since the publication of the previously cited paper on geant4 pixe simulation .",
    "this paper evaluates the cross sections deriving from these evolutions , along with those calculated by mit s code @xcite ( identified in the following as kio - lio ) , which is consistent with pristine ecpssr formulation .",
    "the k and l shell proton ionization cross sections produced by these three theoretical generators are compared with reference collections of experimental data to assess their validity , in compliance with the ieee standard for software verification and validation @xcite .",
    "the results of this validation process document quantitatively the relative merits of the three codes , evaluate the impact of the newly available calculations on geant4 accuracy and identify the state - of - the - art of theoretical cross sections for pixe simulation with geant4 .",
    "in the pwba approach @xcite , the first - order born approximation is used in scattering theory to describe the interaction between an incident charged particle and an atomic target .",
    "this treatment is justified when the atomic number of the projectile is much smaller than the atomic number of the target , and the velocity of the incident particle is much larger than the velocity of the target - atom electron velocities .",
    "the pwba cross section in the center of mass system for the ionization of a given shell is given by @xmath1 where : @xmath2 @xmath3 is the bohr radius , @xmath4 is the projectile atomic number , @xmath5 is the effective atomic number of the target atom , @xmath6 is the reduced universal function , and the reduced atomic electron binding energy and reduced projectile energy are given by @xmath7 @xmath8 with e , m and u representing the energy , mass and atomic binding energy of the projectile and the target , respectively identified by the indices 1 and 2",
    ". the analytical formulation of the reduced universal function @xmath6 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the ecpssr theory @xcite was proposed to address the shortcomings of the pwba approach in the energy range relevant to pixe experimental practice ( approximately up to a few tens of mev ) ; it accounts for the energy loss and coulomb deflection of the projectile , the perturbed stationary state and relativistic nature of the target s inner shell .",
    "the ecpssr cross section for a given shell is expressed in terms of the pwba one : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coulomb deflection correction , @xmath11 is the correction factor for binding energy and polarization effects , @xmath12 is the relativistic correction , @xmath13 is the minimum momentum transfer and @xmath14 @xmath15 being the projectile velocity .",
    "further refinements and modifications of the ecpssr theory have been proposed : they involve using relativistic dirac - hartree - slater wave functions in computing the form factors of the theory @xcite ( identified in the following as ecpssr - hs ) , account for changes in binding energy of electron states due to the presence of the positive ion projectile in the atom ( united atom correction , identified as ecpssr - ua ) , and extend the applicability of the theory to relativistic light projectiles for k shell calculations @xcite ( identified as ecpssr - he ) .",
    "the evaluation concerns three publicly accessible generators of proton ionization cross sections .",
    "two of them , isics and ercs08 , are distributed through the computer physics communications ( cpc ) program library ; the third is available directly from its author , as specified in @xcite .",
    "the isics code @xcite calculates k , l and m shell ionization cross sections by proton and @xmath0 particle impact according to the pwba approximation and the ecpssr theory in multiple variants .    the first version of isics @xcite provided the options of pwba and plain ecpssr calculations ; later versions have added capabilites for hartree - slater calculations @xcite , united atom option @xcite and treatment of relativistic light projectiles @xcite .",
    "the latest version distributed through the cpc program library at the time of writing this paper is isics 2011 @xcite ; it implements a few changes with respect to the previous 2008 version , that contribute to the numerical robustness of the code .",
    "isics versions up to 2008 used bearden and burr s compilation @xcite of atomic binding energies ; isics 2011 version provides also the option of using williams compilation @xcite , although the default configuration still uses bearden and burr s values .",
    "the theoretical cross sections included in the pixe data library associated with geant4 9.4 have been produced with isics 2008 .",
    "ercs08 @xcite is a fortran program for computing electron removal cross section by protons and heavier ions .",
    "it encompasses the calculation of direct ionization and electron capture cross sections ; only the former is considered in this paper .",
    "the calculations are based on the ecpssr theory ; the program allows the configuration of individual components of the theory ( e , c , pss , r ) , as well as other options : r - left ( as described in @xcite ) , united atom and hsr ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "the program provides a default configuration for each shell type ( k , l or m ) , which can be overridden by the user .",
    "the default configuration for the k shell activates the calculation of the form factor involved in the ecpssr theory using exact limits of integration and the correction for relativistic hartree - slater wave functions for the k shell ( the hsr option ) .",
    "the united atom approach is taken into account in the default configuration for all shells .",
    "a few test cases documented in @xcite show that ercs08 calculates ecpssr cross sections compatible with isics 2006 version to one unit at the fourth significant figure , when it is configured to reproduce the same plain ecpssr settings as isics 2006 .",
    "although @xcite states that differences with respect to isics may be larger when ercs08 is run using its own default parameters and input data , the authors of this paper could not find evidence of the experimental validation of the default configuration of this code in the literature .",
    "the code includes a set of atomic binding energies ; according to @xcite , they derive from experimental values in the literature when available , otherwise from theoretical values or , when neither was deemed available , from a first order linear regression analysis applied to available data for elements with atomic number greater than 79 documented in @xcite .",
    "some of the binding energies distributed with ercs08 could be identified as taken from bearden and burr s compilation @xcite , the theoretical values of table iv in @xcite and the 1978 edition of the table of isotopes @xcite ; however , the source of other values remains unidentified .",
    "although theoretical binding energies are available for any elements with atomic number up to 100 in eadl ( evaluated atomic data library ) @xcite , they do not appear to have been used in the program .",
    "a software system to calculate ecpssr cross sections has been developed in pascal by  .",
    "mit @xcite and is available on request directly from its author ; it can be executed on windows systems . since it does not appear identified in the literature by a specific name , for convenience it is referred to in the following as kio - lio , as these are the names of the executable files provided by the author respectively for k and l shell computations .",
    "the code implements the method described in @xcite for the k shell and @xmath16 , @xmath17 subshells ; the cross section for @xmath18 subshell ionization is calculated by the same function as that for the @xmath17 subshell , with appropriate binding energy value and further multiplied by a factor two .",
    "the code includes three options of atomic electron binding energies , corresponding to the compilations by bearden and burr @xcite , the 1978 edition of the table of isotopes @xcite and sevier @xcite ; nevertheless , they can not be selected through the user interface , therefore the distributed executable files limit the production to the default configuration with sevier s binding energies .",
    "all of the three generators implement calculations based on the ecpssr theory ; nevertheless , as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_compak]-[fig_compal3 ] , the cross sections they calculate exhibit some differences .",
    "the figures adopt consistent color , line and marker style throughout the paper to facilitate the identification of the behavior of each generator .",
    "the histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig_compak ] concern cross sections generated by ercs08 and kio in their default configurations for k shell , and by isics configured according to the same nominal options as the two other codes : to calculate ecpssr - hs - ua cross sections ( nominally equivalent to ercs08 default ) and plain ecpssr ones ( nominally equivalent to kio ) .",
    "the cross sections are calculated at the same energies as the experimental data collected in @xcite , which , apart from a few measurements at 160 mev , span the energy range up to approximately 50 mev .    fig .",
    "[ fig_compal1]-[fig_compal3 ] concerns l shell cross sections calculated at the same energies ( up to 4 mev ) as the experimental data in @xcite : by ercs08 and lio in their default configurations for l shell , and by isics configured to calculate ecpssr - ua cross sections ( nominally equivalent to ercs08 default for l subshells ) .",
    "the histograms of isics plain ecpssr cross sections , corresponding to lio s default configuration , are not superimposed to the other plots for better clarity , since they look very close to those produced by the ecpssr - ua option .    for nominally equivalent theoretical approaches",
    ", discrepant results may arise from different mathematical methods adopted in the calculations , the use of different atomic parameters ( e.g. binding energies ) , different software algorithms or numerical precision enforced in the code , or other computational details .",
    "comparisons with experimental data are required to quantify how the differences of the various cross section generators affect the accuracy of the results they produce .",

    "the validation process involves the comparison of cross sections calculated by the three generators with experimental data .",
    "the same sources of experimental data used in the validation of the geant4 pixe data library documented in @xcite were exploited in the validation process of the three cross section generators considered in this paper .",
    "they are established compilations of experimental data in the field ; moreover , the use of the same experimental references allows a comparative evaluation of the accuracy of the newly available generators and the currently distributed geant4 pixe data library , thus facilitating the identification of possible improvements to it .",
    "the reference experimental data for k shell ionization were extracted from the compilation in @xcite , which includes ionization cross sections along with x - ray and auger electron production cross sections .",
    "the production cross sections were rescaled into ionization ones using the fluorescence yields compiled in @xcite ; uncertainties were propagated accordingly .",
    "the reference data for l shell cross sections validation were assembled from two complementary collections @xcite .",
    "the experimental compilations report only total l shell cross section data for a few lighter elements ; sub - shell data are listed only for elements with atomic number larger than 44 .",
    "the experimental data often exhibit large discrepancies , and systematic effects are likely to be present for some elements , for which measurements deriving from different sources appear to be discordant .",
    "isics cross sections were calculated using isicsoo , a refactored version of the original isics windows code , which has been especially tailored for large scale productions of data libraries on linux platforms .",
    "isicsoo provides the same physics functionality as isics 2011 ; its detailed features and verification are documented in @xcite .",
    "the source code is intended to be available through the computer physics communications program library .",
    "the cross sections generated by isicsoo appear equivalent to those computed by isics 2008 ; the relative differences , as shown for example in fig .",
    "[ fig_isicsversion ] for k shell ionization cross sections corresponding to plain ecpssr configuration , are of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "ercs08 was compiled and run on a linux system to produce the cross sections subject to validation .",
    "the production on a linux platform required a small modification to the code released through the cpc program library , limited to the user interface for run control .",
    "input files were generated for each of the test cases through the windows gui to ensure consistency with the default settings provided by the system ; they activated only the calculation of direct ionization .",
    "the ercs08 production system in a linux environment was verified to generate identical results to the original code run through the windows gui , consistent with those documented in @xcite .",
    "the production of isics and ercs08 cross sections was performed on an intel core2 quad q9300 cpu computer equipped with scientific linux 5 operating system and gcc 4.1.2 compiler .",
    "the executable provided by the author was used for the production of kio - lio cross sections on a microsoft windows xp platform .    for the purpose of validation",
    "the theoretical cross sections were calculated at the same energy as the experimental data to avoid any perturbation to the intrinsic accuracy of the theoretical generators due to interpolation algorithms .",
    "this test configuration differs from the one reported in @xcite , where the cross sections subject to test were interpolated from tabulations produced according to the pre - defined energy grid adopted for the data library associated with the geant4 toolkit .",
    "the different configuration is justified by the different purpose of the test process : validating the geant4 cross section simulation models , that include the interpolation of a data library , in the previous paper , and evaluating the intrinsic accuracy of three theoretical generators in this one .      as remarked in the previous sections , the differences among the values calculated by the three generators are small ( approximately a few percent ) ; their effect on the accuracy of the cross sections can be appreciated only through statistical methods .",
    "the analysis for the validation of theoretical cross section calculations follows the procedure reported in @xcite .",
    "it is articulated over two stages : first a series of @xmath20 tests @xcite , comparing theoretical and experimental cross sections for each element and shell or subshell , followed by categorical analysis to identify differences across the results of the @xmath20 test associated with the three generators . some experimental data exhibiting large discrepancies with respect to other data at the same or neighboring energies , suggesting the presence of systematic effects , were excluded from the computation of the @xmath20 statistic .",
    "the statistical toolkit @xcite was used for goodness - of - fit tests .",
    "the null hypothesis in the goodness - of - fit testing process is defined as the compatibility that the theoretical and experimental cross section distributions subject to comparison derive from the same parent distribution . unless differently specified , a 0.05 significance level is set to define the critical region of rejection of the null hypothesis .",
    "contingency tables are built from the outcome of the @xmath20 test to determine the equivalent behavior of the generators .",
    "the input to contingency tables derives from the results of the @xmath20 test for each element and shell or subshell : they are classified respectively as `` pass '' or `` fail '' according to whether the corresponding p - value is consistent with the defined significance level .",
    "the null hypothesis consists in assuming , for each contingency table , the equivalence of the generators it compares at reproducing experimental measurements .",
    "the contingency tables are analyzed with fisher s exact test @xcite , with the @xmath20 test applying yates continuity correction @xcite , and with pearson s @xmath20 test @xcite when the number of entries in the cells justifies its applicability .",
    "a significance level of 0.05 is set to determine the rejection of the null hypothesis , unless specified differently .",

    "the results are summarized in table [ tab_effk ] , where the test cases for which the null hypothesis of compatibility of calculated and experimental distributions is rejected at 0.05 significance level are counted as `` fail '' , otherwise as `` pass '' .",
    "the efficiency of each theoretical generator s configuration is defined as the ratio between the `` passed '' and total test cases .",
    "it is evident from the results in table [ tab_effk ] that isics 2011 ecpssr - hs , ecpssr - hs - ua and ercs08 default configuration are the most efficient at reproducing experimental cross sections , while kio and the other isics options produce slightly less accurate results",
    ". nevertheless , as shown in the contingency tables in table [ tab_contk ] , the differences in efficiency are not statistically significant at 95% confidence level .",
    "although the statistical analysis over the complete data samples provides an overall picture of the accuracy of the three cross section generators , the detailed results of the @xmath20 test in table [ tab_pvaluek ] can be useful to optimize the choice in some specialized use cases : for instance , ercs08 cross sections for silicon are compatible with experimental data @xcite , while the two other generators fail at reproducing compatible cross sections at 0.05 significance level for this element ; kio succeeds at reproducing equivalent tungsten cross sections at 0.05 significance level , while both isics ecpssr - hs - ua and ercs08 default configurations fail . in this respect , however , it is worthwhile to note that in the case of tungsten , as well as for other test cases concerning heavy elements and relatively high ( @xmath21 mev ) energy , the hartree - slater correction does not improve the accuracy of ecpssr calculations , actually the opposite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in the data driven approach to pixe simulation described in @xcite , the cross sections calculated by analytical generators are tabulated at predefined energies and used in monte carlo simulation to compute cross sections corresponding to the energy of a given particle being tracked through matter .    a test was performed to verify if the interpolation process performed in geant4 would significantly affect the accuracy of the theoretical cross sections .    the distribution of the relative difference between interpolated and theoretical ecpssr cross sections is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_interpol ] for k shell cross sections ; the distributions for l subshells are similar .",
    "the data span the energy range covered by experimental measurements ; the theoretical cross sections are generated by isics , while the interpolated values are computed by logarithmic interpolation of the tabulations produced by isics .",
    "the plot includes only truly interpolated values : cross sections calculated by the interpolation algorithm at energies corresponding to the tabulated values are excluded , since the differences are obviously null .",
    "the distribution can be described by a gaussian with 0.17% mean and 0.11% standard deviation ; the tail corresponds to regions of relatively steep variation of the cross sections as a function of energy , mostly occurring with light targets at low energies ( below 1 mev ) .",
    "the error due to interpolation is negligible with respect to the experimental uncertainties of the cross sections , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_interpexp ] .            interpolated cross sections exhibit the same compatibility with experiment as theoretically calculated ones : the outcome of the @xmath20 test , as rejection or non - rejection of the null hypothesis at 0.05 significance level , is strictly identical for ecpssr cross sections calculated by isics and interpolated from tabulations produced with isics , when they are compared to the same experimental samples applying the same analysis criteria , although the test statistic assumes slightly different numerical values for the two categories in the individual test cases .",
    "this result holds for cross sections interpolated from isics 2008 tabulations with respect to theoretical values directly calculated by either isics 2008 or 2011 .    from this test one",
    "evinces that the interpolation process used in geant4 pixe simulation @xcite introduces a negligible perturbation to the accuracy of the cross sections calculated in the course of the simulation ; it also confirms that the updates implemented in isics 2011 do not modify the accuracy of geant4 pixe simulation with respect to the data library distributed with geant4 9.4 , which is based on the previous isics version .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that these results concerning the interpolation of cross section tabulations produced by isics concern the data library and interpolation algorithm described in @xcite ; they would not necessarily hold for tabulations adopting different sampling intervals or exploiting other interpolation algorithms .",
    "three publicly available theoretical generators of inner shell ionization by proton impact have been analyzed to assess the state - of - the - art in the field : the 2011 version of isics , the new code ercs08 and mit s software system ( here called kio - lio ) .",
    "the accuracy achieved by the three generators has been estimated through the statistical comparison of their results with experimental k and l shell cross sections .",
    "the analysis confirms quantitatively the qualitative similarity of the three generators . for k shell ionization , isics and ercs08 exhibit the same overall efficiency at reproducing experimental references , while the kio system is slightly less accurate . for the l shell ,",
    "isics achieves the highest efficiency and lio the lowest : nevertheless , the differences among the generators are not statistically significant at 0.05 level .",
    "one can conclude that isics represents the state - of - the - art among freely available ecpssr generators .",
    "although quite similar in their overall statistical performance , the three generators exhibit distinctive features for a few specific elements ( for instance , for silicon k shell ionization ) .",
    "their documentation in the detailed results of this paper provides guidance to optimize the selection of cross section options in applications , which may be sensitive to the accuracy of the results for specific targets of experimental interest .",
    "these results are relevant to the production of cross section tabulations for monte carlo particle transport , and the selection of optimal cross section options in simulation applications .",
    "the analysis also assessed the equivalent compatibility with measurements of the 2011 and 2008 versions of isics ; the latter was used for the production of the cross section data library released in geant4 9.4 for pixe simulation .",
    "moreover , it demonstrated that the interpolation of tabulated values does not significantly affect the accuracy of the cross sections calculated in geant4 .",
    "the pixe data library has been extended to encompass tabulations produced by the other generators analyzed in this paper in addition to those based on isics , so that users can profit from the distinctive features of the three generators identified in this study .",
    "an updated version is intended to be released with a forthcoming version of the geant4 toolkit and through the rsicc distribution center .",
    "an extension to geant4 code is also foreseen to provide functionality for empirically scaling ecpssr k shell cross sections .",
    "apart from the calculation of cross sections for the ionization of target atoms , which is the subject of this paper , the simulation of pixe with geant4 involves the atomic relaxation , whose accuracy is documented in @xcite . other issues concerning the consistent treatment of the discrete process of atomic relaxation along with the ionization process , which is affected by infrared divergences ,",
