    "with the advent of the square kilometre array ( ska ) , magnetic fields will be regularly probed out to high redshift @xcite .",
    "it is necessary , therefore , to model theoretically such magnetic fields .",
    "much recent progress has been made in magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) cosmological simulations , but the dynamic range allowed by such simulations is still too small to faithfully account for important ( sub)galactic - scale processes including dynamo action .",
    "therefore , theoretical modelling of magnetic fields of galaxies , using a combination of analytical and numerical approaches , is crucial . in particular , magnetic fields of magnitude @xmath2",
    "are known to be present in the diffuse interstellar media ( ism ) of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "such fields can be loosely divided into large - scale ( also known as regular ) fields , which are coherent on scales larger than those of turbulence , and small - scale ( also known as fluctuating ) fields , which have coherence lengths of at most the outer scale of turbulence , @xmath3 .",
    "a typical estimate for @xmath3 within the disc of a galaxy is @xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) .    in the presence of cosmic ray electrons ,",
    "the large - scale magnetic fields of galaxies are sources of polarized synchrotron emission .",
    "the component of the field parallel to the direction of propagation of such emission causes the plane of polarization to rotate via the faraday effect .",
    "likewise , polarized emission from background sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) will undergo faraday rotation as it passes through intervening galaxies on its way to the observer . therefore ,",
    "modelling the large - scale magnetic fields of galaxies may be useful for predicting and interpreting cosmological radio polarization and rm observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "realistic galactic magnetic field models could also be useful for helping to constrain the environments of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , using their observed rms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or modelling the transport of cosmic rays of extra - galactic origin from within their source galaxies .",
    "at present there is no analytical solution for galactic large - scale magnetic fields that is sufficiently generic , realistic , and versatile to be suitable for the kinds of applications outlined above .",
    "phenomenological models @xcite are undoubtedly useful for some problems , but models that are more physically motivated , yet still consistent with observations , are needed .",
    "one approach to painting magnetic fields onto galaxies is to evolve each galactic field separately using a mean - field dynamo simulation .",
    "such simulations would use as input evolving parameters from , e.g. , a semi - analytical galaxy formation model , @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is computationally rather demanding .",
    "an alternative , albeit less rigorous approach , is to assume that such dynamo processes lead to saturation on timescales small compared with galaxy evolution timescales , allowing one to adopt a steady - state solution for the magnetic field using as input coeval galactic parameter values",
    ". an analytical solution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) has indeed been used for just this purpose @xcite , but this solution contains no information about the vertical distribution of magnetic field within the galaxy . on the other hand , the 3-dimensional , or at least ` 2.5-dimensional ' ( 2.5d , cylindrical symmetry ) , spatial structure of the field",
    "is required for some of the applications mentioned above .",
    "this motivates the main purpose of the present work : to show how such a 2.5d solution of the suitably approximated dynamo equations can be constructed , and to demonstrate the efficacy of this solution by comparing it with numerical solutions of a less approximate set of dynamo equations .",
    "our model leads to a steady quadrupole - like configuration for the regular magnetic field in the saturated state , which is consistent with results from standard galactic dynamo theory .",
    "dynamos in thin accretion discs are probably more complicated , with , e.g. , oscillatory solutions often obtained @xcite , and our model is not meant to be applied in such a context . on the other hand",
    "it is not meant to describe any galaxy in particular .",
    "we realize , however , that modelling the field of our own galaxy , in particular ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is important for many investigations , such as modelling cosmic ray propagation or subtracting foreground emission in cosmological studies . in this context",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we motivate the full set of dynamo equations , discuss the numerical method used to solve them , and summarize the model for the underlying galaxy .",
    "this is followed by an explanation of the analytical method in section  [ sec : analytic ] .",
    "our main results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "here we compare analytical and numerical solutions for four different parameter regimes .",
    "further , for each parameter regime , we compare a suite of numerical solutions , each obtained from a successively more approximate set of equations .",
    "thus , a secondary aim is to shed light on the applicability of various approximations used in the literature .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and we offer some conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "following the standard prescription , the magnetic field @xmath5 and velocity field @xmath6 are each written as the sum of a mean ( denoted by uppercase ) and a fluctuating ( denoted by lowercase ) component .",
    "averaging the induction equation we then obtain the standard result @xmath7 where we have neglected terms involving the microscopic ( ohmic ) diffusivity since the magnetic reynolds number @xmath8 in galaxies . here",

    "other terms in equation   may not always be negligible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but as our main aim is to present a basic analytical solution , we leave such complications for future work .",
    "the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath18 is estimated as @xmath19 the kinetic term @xmath20 , meanwhile , is estimated as @xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angular velocity . in our models",
    "@xmath24 , so @xmath25 . the expression for @xmath26 is the standard formula of krause @xcite , while the expression for @xmath27 includes the effects of ` rotational saturation ' . for @xmath28 , @xmath1 and @xmath18",
    "would be rotationally quenched @xcite , but that case does not arise in our models .",
    "the evolution of @xmath29 is governed by the dynamical quenching equation @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the equipartition field strength .",
    "we have neglected an ohmic term in equation  , which is anyway negligible for realistic values of the @xmath29-flux density @xmath32 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath33 ; that is , we assume a strouhal number @xmath34 . the strength of the mean magnetic field in the saturated state is approximately proportional to @xmath3 and thus to @xmath35 .    in general a flux density of the form",

    "@xcite is left for future work .",
    "we do , however , compare our results with results using the simple algebraic @xmath1-quenching formalism , @xmath40 with @xmath41 a parameter which in the literature has typically been set to unity .",
    "we make use of a generalized algebraic quenching formalism that allows @xmath41 to be estimated analytically from the dynamical quenching equation  .",

    "the parameter @xmath41 in the generalized algebraic quenching equation   is then estimated as @xmath51      as we are dealing with axially symmetric magnetic fields , it is convenient to express the magnetic field in terms of scalar potentials @xmath52 and @xmath53 . here , the flux function @xmath52 enters through the poloidal field , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for the toroidal potential .",

    "we further demand that , by symmetry , @xmath71 as @xmath72 ; this then implies @xmath73 at @xmath70 .",
    "finiteness of @xmath74 implies @xmath75 ; we choose @xmath76 without loss of generality .",
    "this is the natural choice since @xmath77 is then proportional to the magnetic flux through a horizontal disc of radius @xmath60 centred at the position @xmath78 , @xmath79 finiteness of @xmath80 implies @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath82 , while @xmath83 , as @xmath72 , and these values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are set explicitly .",
    "we also set @xmath86 to avoid a singularity in the diffusive flux term at the origin .",
    "further , we adopt the same boundary conditions @xmath87 at @xmath88 , corresponding to the outermost radius of the simulation domain ; solutions are insensitive to the choice of boundary conditions at @xmath88 since @xmath89 is chosen to be well outside the region of dynamo action .",
    "we set @xmath90 .",
    "we impose vacuum boundary conditions @xmath91 at @xmath92 , which implies @xmath93 at @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the mean magnetic field is forced to be vertical outside the disc . in imposing these boundary conditions",
    "we ignore the gaseous halo , leaving its inclusion for future work . to see how these boundary conditions arise , begin with the requirement that @xmath94 outside the disc .",
    "this implies @xmath95 .",
    "obviously , @xmath96 as @xmath97 , which then implies @xmath98 at @xmath92 .",
    "setting @xmath94 also leads to the condition @xmath99 .",
    "the right - hand side is usually small compared with the left hand side , so this condition can be approximated by @xmath100 outside the disc .",
    "this approximation becomes invalid for @xmath101 , so our model is less reliable at the very centre of the disc .",
    "since @xmath82 as @xmath97 we must have @xmath102 at @xmath92 .",
    "further , we set @xmath103 at @xmath92 , which allows @xmath29 to flow across the disc boundary .    we have also experimented with other choices of boundary conditions on @xmath92 .",
    "we tried various combinations of @xmath104 ( instead of @xmath105 ) , @xmath100 so that @xmath106 ( instead of @xmath102 ) and @xmath95 so that @xmath107 ( instead of @xmath98 ) at @xmath92 .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath108 implies @xmath109 .",
    "interestingly , for models with a strong outflow , changing the boundary conditions in any of these ways has almost no effect on the solution . however , for models without an outflow ( or with a weak outflow ) , solutions are rather sensitive to the vertical boundary conditions .",
    "the explanation for this is that if the outflow removes the field and @xmath29 at the boundaries rapidly enough , boundary effects can not propagate inward .",
    "changing the boundary condition on @xmath29 to @xmath104 at @xmath92 has little effect on the solutions for @xmath50 , even if no outflow is present .",
    "however , if @xmath110 is adopted at the vertical boundaries , then @xmath29 undergoes a sign change in boundary layers near the disc surface , leading to magnetic field configurations that are rather different from the standard solutions ( for models without a strong outflow ) . on the other hand , if we choose @xmath95 instead of @xmath98 at the boundaries , we find that either the code does not converge or , if @xmath100 at @xmath111 is also chosen , the field decays .",
    "we use an @xmath60@xmath0 grid that is linear in both coordinates , and solve the equations using the same finite differencing ( 6th order ) and runge - kutta time - stepping ( 3rd order ) routines employed in the pencil code @xcite . for thin disc solutions , we use a resolution @xmath112 , excluding ghost zones , for the runs presented , while for the model with a thicker disc , we use @xmath113 .",

    "[ fig : bcompare_d](b ) , the dashed lines show the normalized magnetic energy density averaged across the disc @xmath223 , plotted against radius , in the saturated regime ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "the normalized equipartition field @xmath225 is shown as a dotted line for reference .",
    "the field is of approximately equipartition strength , and a few times larger for model  a than for model  b , as the stronger outflow in model  b leads to a less efficient dynamo .",
    "this , in turn , is explained by referring back to equations   and . written in terms of @xmath226 , where @xmath227 represents @xmath60 or @xmath61 , and concerning ourselves only with the first terms on the right hand side , we have @xmath228 the first term on the right - hand side is the expansion term , and leads to a reduction of @xmath226 in our model , whereas the second term is the advection term and leads to an enhancement of @xmath226 .",
    "though both terms are important , the expansion term turns out to be larger , leading to an overall reduction of @xmath226 .",
    "for the same reason , the saturated magnetic energy tapers off more rapidly with radius for model  b than for model  a. the magnetic field of model  c , meanwhile , saturates at a strength a few times larger than that of model  a. note that @xmath229 ( orange ) dominates over @xmath230 ( blue ) and @xmath231 ( green ) in all models , as expected , except at @xmath232 , where @xmath231 may exceed @xmath229 and @xmath230 ( see also figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig : bicontour_d ] ) . for model  d ,",
    "the vertically averaged magnetic energy actually peaks at @xmath70 , due to the strong vertical field there , but @xmath233 is much weaker for other models .    the analytical solution   for @xmath234 is shown as a dashed - dotted line in panels  [ fig : bcompare](d)(f ) and [ fig : bcompare_d](b ) , and generally gives a remarkably accurate estimate of the saturation field strength . in model  c ,",
    "the agreement is slightly worse for @xmath60 smaller than the radius at which the field strength peaks .",
    "this is caused by the neglect of the @xmath235 effect in the analytical model ; when this effect is excluded from the mean - field simulation , the agreement is much better .",
    "the @xmath235 effect is more important for larger @xmath3 or @xmath138 , which was also found in .",
    "therefore , the increased importance of the @xmath235 effect with @xmath3 seems to persist even when rotational saturation of @xmath20 is implemented .",
    "note also that the analytical solution , being local , does not taken into account the radial transport .",
    "therefore , it can not be applied at radii @xmath236 or @xmath237 where @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the radii for which the normalized dynamo number @xmath240 , and where the analytical field strength goes to zero in each plot . moreover , the domain for which @xmath241 is generally underestimated by the analytical solution .",
    "this is because the solution overestimates the damaging effect of the outflow in the kinematic regime ( as mentioned above when discussing @xmath167 ) , and also because the @xmath235 effect and terms involving @xmath233 are ignored in the analytical solution .",
    "we now turn to the two - dimensional plots of figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig : bicontour_d ] , which show the field components for the saturated state , under various approximations , described in section  [ sec : approx ] .",
    "we begin by comparing the full @xmath242 numerical solutions of panels  ( a ) for models  a  d .",
    "the obvious difference in going from model  a to the strong outflow model  b , is that the mean magnetic field becomes confined to a smaller radial domain , because of the damaging effects of the outflow .",
    "the component @xmath57 is still peaked at about @xmath243 , where the dynamo number peaks , but the components @xmath145 and @xmath233 , whose generation depends on the @xmath1-effect , are peaked at somewhat larger radii compared to model  a because the outflow weakens the dynamo at small @xmath60 . in model  c ,",
    "the peak of the dynamo number occurs farther out at about @xmath244 due to the rotational saturation of @xmath20 , and the peak of @xmath57 is located at about the same radius .",
    "the components @xmath145 and @xmath233 are also pushed out to larger radius compared to models  a and b. these features can also be seen in the middle row of figure  [ fig : bcompare ] .",
    "we have also run a variation of model  c without rotational saturation , but do not show the figures for the sake of brevity .",
    "as expected , the field in that case resembles qualitatively that of model  a at small radius , e.g. in that its components respectively peak at roughly the same radii as in model  a. however , the profile of @xmath57 retains the ` double - tail ' morphology at small radius ( dip at the midplane ) seen in figure  [ fig : bicontour_c ] , as well as the long tail extending out to @xmath245 . in the thicker disc model , model  d ,",
    "striking features are apparent at small radius , including a strong double - tail morphology in @xmath57 . at @xmath70 ,",
    "@xmath145 changes sign at about @xmath246 , which is not very different from model  a , in spite of the twice larger @xmath43 in model  d. however , real galaxies probably typically have @xmath43 equal to a few hundred @xmath247 at @xmath70 , flaring to @xmath248 for @xmath249 @xcite , which makes the small-@xmath60 behaviour of model  d less relevant . at larger radius @xmath250",
    ", the field resembles qualitatively that of model  a , though scaled to occupy the larger cross - section of the disc .",
    "more interesting , perhaps , is that @xmath145 is less extended with radius than in model  a , while @xmath57 is more extended .",
    "importantly , the overall field strength falls off less slowly with radius than for model  a because @xmath251 remains above unity even at large @xmath60 .      in panels  ( g)(i ) of figure",
    "[ fig : bcompare ] and ( c ) of figure  [ fig : bcompare_d ] , we plot the mean magnetic pitch angle averaged over the disc cross - section @xmath252 in the saturated ( solid ) and kinematic ( dashed ) regimes .",
    "the spikes at @xmath253 in figure  [ fig : bcompare](i ) and the peculiar behaviour of @xmath254 for @xmath232 are caused by @xmath254 wrapping around from @xmath255 to @xmath256 , as per the definition .",
    "when averaging @xmath254 over the disc cross section , these discontinuities also lead to unphysical wiggles in @xmath257 over the finite grid .",
    "this is just a consequence of the discontinuous definition of @xmath254 , not of any numerical problem in the simulation . if @xmath254 were redefined to allow values @xmath258 , @xmath257 would continue to rise smoothly as @xmath72 .",
    "note also that the unphysical behaviour of @xmath259 at @xmath260 in panel  [ fig : bcompare](h ) is not of any consequence as the field is effectively zero in that region .",
    "as expected , @xmath261 , @xmath262 is of the order of @xmath263 for the fiducial model , model  a , and is slightly larger when an outflow is present , in model  b. also as expected , @xmath262 in the saturated regime is generally smaller than that in the kinematic regime .",
    "blue dashed - dotted and dotted lines show the predictions of the analytical model for the saturated ( equation  ) and kinematic ( equation  ) regimes , respectively .",
    "note that the analytical prediction for @xmath254 in the kinematic regime is independent of @xmath48 , whereas the numerical solution shows a weak dependence of @xmath254 on @xmath48 in the kinematic regime , as can be seen by comparing the dashed lines in panels  ( g ) and ( h ) of figure  [ fig : bcompare ] .",
    "analytical solutions predict @xmath254 remarkably accurately , especially for the saturated state .",
    "this is not completely surprising as they were calibrated against local numerical saturated solutions .",
    "however , @xmath262 at small @xmath60 in model  c is larger than predicted because of the @xmath235 effect . nevertheless , the agreement with global numerical solutions is striking and implies that the analytical solution and the approximations underlying it are quite robust .",
    "of course , solutions will in general depend on the galactic rotation curve , and rotation curves that vary more rapidly in radius than the one adopted here would lead to larger deviations of the global solutions from the local estimates , as the latter ignore radial derivatives .",
    "we study the effects of the various approximations using figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig : bicontour_d ] ; a concise summary of these approximations can be found in table  [ tab : approximations ] .",
    "we have also studied plots of residuals between @xmath145 , @xmath57 , and @xmath233 from any two different panels of a given figure , but for the sake of brevity , these are not shown .",
    "below , we sometimes refer to models run using different approximations as ` sub - models ' ; in going from one panel ( sub - model ) to the next in sequence , we make one additional approximation but otherwise keep the sub - model the same .",
    "panels  ( a ) show the full @xmath242 solution .",
    "we first compare panels  ( a ) with panels  ( b ) , which show the @xmath264 solution .",
    "this approximation neglects terms containing @xmath1 in equation  . for model",
    "a , shown in figure  [ fig : bicontour_a ] , the @xmath235 effect leads to a slight increase in the field components away from the midplane for @xmath232 , which is noticeable in the slight dip in @xmath57 at @xmath64 .",
    "the same effect is seen in model  b , but is less pronounced , while for model  c , the effect is visually similar , but here the @xmath235 effect produces a decrement in @xmath57 near the midplane , with an associated ` push ' of @xmath233 to slightly larger radius . for model  d ,",
    "the field strength at small @xmath60 is greatly reduced in panel  [ fig : bicontour_d](b ) compared to [ fig : bicontour_d](a ) , and the effect on the morphology of @xmath57 is qualitatively the same as for model  a , but more pronounced .    in going from panels  ( b ) to ( c ) of figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig : bicontour_d ] , @xmath233 is now neglected in the equations , and then computed _ a posteriori _ using @xmath147 .",
    "this is known as the thin - disc approximation , and is formally valid for @xmath265 .",
    "terms involving @xmath266 in the mean induction equation are _ not _ neglected in this approximation , however , as @xmath267 from @xmath147 . in our implementation , this means neglecting radial derivatives of @xmath52 , _ except _ in equation  .",
    "in fact , in going from panels  ( b ) to ( c ) equations   and are not affected ( we confirm that kinematic solutions for @xmath145 and @xmath57 are almost identical ) , so any difference between the saturated solutions of these panels stems from the non - linearity  . for models  a  c , there is a slight weakening of the field at small radius in going from panels  ( b ) to ( c ) .",
    "we note that the magnitude of @xmath145 , in particular , is significantly reduced at @xmath268 , though its spatial distribution is only weakly affected .",
    "still , the thin - disc approximation can be seen to be rather robust for these models .",
    "however , for the thick disc model , model  d , departures are more significant , as expected .    in going from panels  ( c ) to ( d ) of figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig :",
    "bicontour_d ] , radial derivatives are now neglected : the local or slab approximation .",
    "this leads to rather drastic cutoffs in @xmath145 and @xmath57 at small and large @xmath60 , where the local solutions are subcritical .",
    "these cutoffs are of course unphysical .",
    "the sharp cutoffs in @xmath145 also lead to a poor reconstruction of @xmath233 .",
    "it is also worth noting that @xmath57 peaks at a slightly larger value when the slab approximation is made .",
    "nevertheless , these plots show that the slab approximation is quite valid for @xmath269 , for the parameter values considered .",
    "perhaps fortuitously , slab solutions of panels  ( d ) better reproduce the strength of @xmath145 , near its peak , than do thin - disc solutions of panels  ( c ) .",
    "the stronger @xmath145 in panels  ( d ) as compared to panels  ( c ) is mainly due to the neglect of the radial diffusion term in equation   in the slab approximation : re - running submodels  ( c ) with this term omitted leads to stronger @xmath145 comparable with that of submodels  ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "we next consider the effect of adopting the generalized algebraic quenching non - linearity in place of the dynamical quenching formalism .",
    "that is we use equation   with equation  , where @xmath41 evaluates to @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 for models  a , b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "thus we compare panels  ( d ) , which , like panels  ( a)(c ) , use dynamical quenching , with panels  ( e ) , which show solutions for a sub - model identical to that shown in panels  ( d ) , except now using generalized algebraic quenching .",
    "the effect on the magnitude and morphology of @xmath50 is seen to be rather small . for model  b",
    "we see that the distributions of @xmath145 and @xmath57 broaden with respect to the midplane .",
    "further , @xmath145 ceases to changes sign at the disc surface , in agreement with the findings of .",
    "finally , we compare the above solutions with the analytical solutions of panels  ( f ) of figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig : bicontour_d ] , calculated using the same resolution as that of the numerical grid .",
    "that solution was obtained by normalizing the critical perturbation solution using the critical no-@xmath0 solution , as explained in section  [ sec : combined ] and table  [ tab : approximations ] .",
    "we have already seen from figure  [ fig : bcompare ] that analytical no-@xmath0 solutions reproduce rather faithfully the vertically averaged properties of the full solutions .",
    "how well do 2.5d ` no-@xmath0 + perturbation ' solutions approximate full numerical solutions ?",
    "it can be seen that for all four models , the analytical solution of panels  ( f ) of figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig : bicontour_d ] agrees reasonably well with the full numerical solution of panels  ( a ) , but fail at small radius .",
    "the differences between analytical and numerical solutions are more noticeable for model  b than for models  a and c , because of the limitations of the analytical methods for the case where large vertical outflows are present . in the presence of a strong outflow ,",
    "analytical solutions underestimate the radial extent of the magnetic field .",
    "for the case with vanishing outflow , and presumably for weak outflows , the analytical solution is as accurate as the numerical slab solution , shown in panels  ( d ) , which neglects radial derivatives .",
    "we note that standard estimates of the outflow velocity give @xmath48 of the order of @xmath274@xmath275 @xcite , so in this context the outflow in our model  b of @xmath276 is very strong . for model  d ,",
    "the thicker disk causes departures from the numerical solutions to be larger than for model  a , as expected .",
    "the technique we have used to obtain a 2.5d analytical solution is simple ( even seemingly naive ) .",
    "yet it gives rather accurate results , so long as we are not concerned with the very centre of the disc and so long as outflows are not very strong .",
    "why should this be ?      more specifically , how could it be that radially local axisymmetric solutions , obtained at each radius by neglecting radial derivatives , can effectively be pasted together to form a global solution ?",
    "the field saturates first at the radius approximately corresponding to the peak of the eigenfunction in the linear regime , and then proceeds to spread out .",
    "this spreading does not happen mainly by radial diffusion , but by the much faster local growth of the field .",
    "therefore , saturation at each radius takes place almost independently @xcite .",
    "the exception to this picture is what takes place near the boundary of the dynamo - active region , i.e.  at the radii @xmath238 and @xmath239 , where @xmath277 .",
    "there the local growth rate becomes negative and non - local radial processes become crucial for reversing the balance , and rendering the dynamo supercritical .",
    "unfortunately , there does not seem to be a simple way to model the field saturation for @xmath236 and @xmath237 , so the field cuts off steeply ( and unphysically ) at @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "any improvement to the analytical model to allow for a more gradual tapering off of the field , in better agreement with numerical solutions of panels  ( a)(c ) of figures  [ fig : bicontour_a][fig : bicontour_d ] , would be usefull .      more broadly",
    ", our results explicitly demonstrate the viability of various approximations often used in the galactic dynamo literature , while exposing some of their limitations .",
    "the @xmath264 approximation is shown to be reasonable for typical parameters , but leads to an underestimate of @xmath262 at small radius , for instance .",
    "for the rotationally saturated @xmath20 case of model  c , and thicker disc of model  d , the @xmath264 solution is inaccurate at small radius , where @xmath233 is important .",
    "making , in addition , the thin disc approximation , for which @xmath233 terms are neglected in the simulation , and calculated _ post factum _ , does not lead to a large difference in solutions for models  a  c , which have a thin disc , but @xmath145 is significantly reduced in magnitude . for model  d , which has a thicker disc , such departures are even more significant , as would be expected .",
    "the slab approximation pastes together local solutions that depend only parametrically on @xmath60 .",
    "as explained above , this solution is invalid near the radii where the local growth rate transitions from positive to negative , but is otherwise remarkably accurate . replacing the dynamical quenching non - linearity by a generalized form of the algebraic @xmath1-quenching non - linearity , which is relatively easy to implement and less demanding computationally ,",
    "is seen to have very little effect on the slab solution . finally , the analytical solution , which combines no-@xmath0 and perturbation solutions , is surprisingly accurate , though not without limitations , as discussed in sections  [ sec : results ] and [ sec : local ] .",
    "as soon as one resorts to pasting together local solutions , the solution for the very central region of the disk becomes invalid .",
    "this is far from ideal , but not particularly damaging , for at least three reasons .",
    "first , the other approximations , such as the @xmath264 approximation , also lead to inaccuracies in this region .",
    "even the vacuum boundary conditions imposed are rather unjustified there , as discussed in section  [ sec : boundary ] .",
    "further , other effects which have been neglected , such as the presence of the galactic bulge , or a small bar in sab galaxies , for example , would also be more important near the centre . in summary",
    "then , we are probably losing less information than it seems in the analytical model by ` losing ' the very centre .",
    "second , for potential applications , such as estimating the faraday rotation due to intervening galaxies on distant agn , the surface area would effectively enter the calculation .",
    "as @xmath278 of the radius corresponds to only @xmath279 of the surface area , the effect of the very centre is likely to be negligible , given other potential uncertainties in the problem .",
    "third , ionized galactic discs are likely to be flared , with @xmath43 typically somewhat smaller than @xmath200 at the centre .",
    "this would allow the validity of all of the sub - models presented to extend down to a smaller radius @xmath280 .",
    "for the same reason , the analytical model also underestimates the field at larger radius @xmath281 .",
    "the field in this region is relatively weak , though the relative surface area is significant .",
    "the neglect of the field in this region is probably only a concern for models with strong outflows , since the disparity is greater in that case , as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we see then that the analytical solution , though crude , is reasonably accurate .",
    "it reproduces faithfully certain key properties of the solution , such as the local vertically averaged pitch angle , as well as the overall magnitude of each field component .",
    "what makes this solution potentially powerful , however , compared with more accurate numerical solutions , is the ease with which it can be implemented .",
    "such solutions could be painted onto all of the galaxies in a cosmological simulation almost instantaneously and almost effortlessly , to any desired spatial resolution .",
    "the greatest shortcoming of such solutions may be their neglect of non - local effects in the disc .",
    "on the other hand , the various parameters can be made to depend on @xmath60 without complicating the method .",
    "for example , making the disc flared so that @xmath43 depends on @xmath60 is a rather trivial extension .",
    "it may also be worth pointing out that analytical solutions are far more transparent , with regard to their interpretation , than their numerical counterparts .",
    "the disc solutions presented can be seen as ` basic ' solutions for spiral galaxies , and they _ may _ be rather sufficient to explain the regular magnetic fields of _ certain _ galaxies . however , many galaxies harbour strong , apparently large - scale , magnetic fields high above the ionized thin disc @xcite . to include this part of the galaxy in our models ,",
    "it is necessary to relax certain approximations , such as the @xmath0-independence of @xmath3 , @xmath131 , etc .",
    ", that may be reasonably accurate for a disc , but fail drastically for a disc - halo system .",
    "such an extension to our models is a logical next step , especially considering that haloes , being relatively extended , may be important in the faraday rotation of background sources .",
    "important work using mean - field dynamo simulations to explore large - scale magnetic fields of disc - halo systems has been carried out , and provides a useful starting point @xcite .",
    "at the same time , analytical dynamo solutions for the halo are at present unavailable and would be interesting to develop .",
    "ultimately , the aim would be to model analytically the disc - halo system , and compare solutions with more realistic numerical solutions , as done above for the pure disc case .",
    "we see the present work as a necessary ` stepping stone ' on the way to this goal .",
    "we have presented a simple , effectively 2.5d axisymmetric analytical solution for the large - scale magnetic field of a disc galaxy in the saturated state .",
    "this solution was shown to agree with full numerical solutions to a reasonable level of fidelity , with the agreement extending down to the magnitudes and spatial morphologies of each individual component of the field .    where our analytical solution is notably less reliable than full numerical solutions is at small radius , @xmath232 or smaller .",
    "it is also less reliable if vertical outflow speeds from the disc are larger than , or in the upper range of , standard estimates , or if the disc is thicker than standard estimates in the inner few @xmath282 .",
    "our solution is simple , transparent , and takes virtually no time to implement .",
    "it is also versatile because the underlying parameters , such as the turbulent speed of energy carrying eddies , disc scale height , and correlation time of turbulence , can be varied and can even be allowed to depend on radius .",
    "in addition to obtaining numerical solutions for our rather general set of equations , we also obtained numerical solutions from successively more idealized versions of these equations , all of which are used to some extent in the dynamo literature . by comparing such solutions we were able to assess the suitability of these approximations , at least for the parameter values considered .",
    "possibly the greatest shortcoming of both the numerical and analytical models is the neglect of the gaseous halo , which has been observed in several edge - on galaxies to emit polarized synchrotron radiation , and probably contains large - scale magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , our model is , we believe , a solid base for exploring more realistic solutions in the future . in the meantime , it is hoped that our analytical solution provides a viable starting point for researchers who are interested in painting magnetic fields onto galaxies in order to explore various observational signatures .",
