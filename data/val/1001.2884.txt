    "since its appearance , there are various kinds of applications of the ideas of tropical geometry to problems in classical geometry .",
    "but in many cases the ambient spaces are toric varieties , and the number of applications of tropical geometry to problems in non - toric varieties are not large . in this paper",
    ", we try to extend the applicability of tropical geometry in some direction , namely the enumerative problems .",
    "more precisely , in this paper we give a method to compute gromov - witten type invariants of fano manifolds of special type , in terms of counting of tropical curves .",
    "our calculation is based on toric degenerations of fano manifolds .",
    "given such degenerations , we can compare holomorphic curves between fano manifolds and ( singular ) toric varieties .",
    "on the other hand , the correspondence between such curves and tropical curves is shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , we can count curves in fano manifolds by counting appropriate tropical curves .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows . after a short review of toric degenerations in section 2",
    ", we try to define gromov - witten type invariants via tropical method in section 3 .",
    "in fact , we will define two types of invariants .",
    "the first one ( theorem [ tropical ] ) is directly related to gromov - witten invariants and defined when the incidence conditions ( subsection [ subsec : incidence ] ) satisfy suitable assumptions ( assumption 1 in subsection [ subsec : incidence ] and the transversality assumption in lemma [ transverse ] ) . in particular , this invariant depends on the incidence conditions only through their homology classes .",
    "the second one ( theorem [ tropical2 ] ) is the analogue of the one considered in @xcite , and regarded as the relative part of the gromov - witten invariants . a priori it might not be a homological invariants , but it gives a lower bound to the corresponding gromov - witten invariants ( see remark [ rem : gw ] ) .",
    "this second invariant is defined under only assumption 1 , and contains the first invariant as a special case .    in the last section ,",
    "we give two examples of the calculation of these invariants for varieties of particular interest ( these are both the first type invariants , so we calculate actual gromov - witten invariants ) . in these cases , in principle we can calculate all genus zero gromov - witten invariants by tropical method . in particular , we can calculate gromov - witten invariants including odd cohomology classes .",
    "also , by the homological invariance of gromov - witten invariants , an interesting combinatorial invariance of the counting number of tropical curves is observed , which can not be deduced purely by tropical method ( remark [ rem : inv ] ) . +",
