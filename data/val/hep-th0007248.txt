    "conventional field - theoretic hamiltonians possess two crucial symmetries , the continuous symmetry of the proper lorentz group and the discrete symmetry of hermiticity .",
    "while lorentz invariance is a physical requirement , hermiticity is a useful but rather mathematical constraint .",
    "however , assuming lorentz invariance and positivity of the spectrum of the hamiltonian one can prove the @xmath9 theorem and thereby establish the physical discrete symmetry of @xmath9 invariance .",
    "recent papers have investigated the consequences of imposing only the physical symmetries of lorentz invariance and @xmath9 invariance in constructing a hamiltonian .",
    "the constraint of @xmath9 invariance is weaker than hermiticity , so hamiltonians having this property need not be hermitian . in quantum mechanics and in scalar quantum field theory",
    "the @xmath10 operator is unity , so @xmath9 symmetry reduces to @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "while it has not yet been proved , there is strong analytical and numerical evidence supporting the conjecture that , except when @xmath11 symmetry is spontaneously broken , the energy levels of many such hamiltonians are all real and positive .",
    "the reality and positivity of the spectrum is apparently a consequence of the @xmath11 symmetry of @xmath12 .",
    "hamiltonians having @xmath11 symmetry been studied in quantum mechanics @xcite and in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "a simple example of such a quantum - mechanical hamiltonian is @xmath13 .",
    "hamiltonians of this form may be regarded as _ complex deformations _ of conventional hermitian hamiltonians . to illustrate this deformation we consider the hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a real number that is _ not necessarily an integer_. when @xmath16 , we have the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , whose spectrum is real and positive . as @xmath17 increases from @xmath18 , the entire spectrum of the hamiltonian smoothly deforms as a function of @xmath17 and remains real and positive for all values of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , these theories are in effect the analytic continuation of conventional quantum mechanics into the complex plane .",
    "these non - hermitian theories exhibit some remarkable properties .",
    "most interesting is that the expectation value of the operator @xmath20 in quantum mechanics and the field @xmath21 in the corresponding quantum field theory is _ nonzero _ when @xmath19 .",
    "this is true even for the @xmath22 hamiltonian that one obtains at @xmath23 , and it is also true for the @xmath24 scalar quantum field theory .",
    "the @xmath24 quantum field theory is particularly surprising because it has a positive real spectrum and exhibits a nonzero value of @xmath25 , and in four - dimensional space - time has a dimensionless coupling constant , is renormalizable , and is asymptotically free ( and thus nontrivial ) .",
    "it may thus provide a useful setting to describe the higgs particle@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the euclidean scalar quantum field theory defined by the lagrangian density @xmath26 our purpose here is to study this quantum field theory in the correlated limit in which two bare lagrangian parameters , the coupling constant @xmath0 and the _ negative _ mass squared @xmath1 , both approach infinity with the ratio @xmath27 held fixed . in a conventional parity - symmetric scalar quantum field theory",
    "this limit is called the _ ising limit_. in the ising limit",

    "we will show , however , that the asymptotic theory exhibits intriguing properties . of considerable interest",
    "is that the one - point green s function @xmath28 approaches the finite value @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , while the ising limit of a parity - symmetric quantum field theory is dominated by a dilute instanton gas , the corresponding correlated limit of a @xmath3-symmetric quantum field theory lacking parity symmetry is dominated by a constant - field configuration with corrections determined by a weak - coupling expansion in which the lines represent propagators of the conventional weak - coupling form and the vertices are proportional to an inverse power of @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] we review the ising limit of a hermitian parity - invariant self - interacting scalar quantum field theory and consider this same correlated limit in a @xmath29-symmetric quantum field theory . in sec .

    "( [ e2.1 ] ) approach universal @xmath17-independent values @xcite .",
    "the terminology `` ising limit '' is taken from statistical mechanics .",
    "the ising model of statistical mechanics describes systems in which there are two equally likely spin states . by analogy , in the correlated limits @xmath33 and @xmath38",
    "the potential @xmath39 develops a deep symmetric double well .",
    "in one euclidean spacetime dimension ( quantum mechanics ) the lagrangian density @xmath40 represents a particle that is equally likely to be in one of two possible states , the left well or the right well .",
    "the ising limit is a strong - coupling phenomenon and is not accessible by a conventional perturbative treatment .",
    "however , a nonperturbative semiclassical analysis in quantum mechanics can be used to calculate the amplitude for the particle to tunnel from one well to the other .",
    "this tunneling amplitude is exponentially small .",
    "the well is symmetric , so the splitting between the lowest energy state and the first excited state is also exponentially small and is proportional to this tunneling amplitude .",
    "the renormalized mass @xmath34 is the difference between the energy of the ( odd - parity ) first excited state and the energy of the ( even - parity ) ground state .",

    "third , we construct the dimensionless renormalized 1pi green s functions @xmath50 .",
    "to do so we perform a wave - function renormalization by multiplying by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the wave - function renormalization constant .",
    "the _ dimensionless _",
    "renormalized green s functions are then obtained by multiplying by the appropriate power of the renormalized mass .",
    "normally @xmath52 is defined as the residue of the pole of the two - point green s function . however , in this paper we use the simpler _ intermediate renormalization scheme _ in which the renormalization is performed in momentum space with the green s functions evaluated at zero momentum on the external legs . in this scheme",
    "the value of @xmath52 is just the two - point green s function in momentum space multiplied by the square of the renormalized mass .",
    "the dimensionless renormalized 1pi green s functions @xmath50 are the coefficients in the taylor expansion of the renormalized effective action . in the ising limit of the parity - symmetric lagrangian density in eq .",
