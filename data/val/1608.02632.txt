    "breaking of hydrodynamic flows in conservative , weakly dispersive media yields dispersive shock waves ( dsws ) characterized by expanding nonlinear wavetrains .",
    "mathematically , a great deal is known about dispersive shock waves in the framework of nonlinear wave modulation theory , also known as whitham theory @xcite , and inverse scattering @xcite for spatio - temporal ( 1 + 1)-dimensional systems ( cf .  the review @xcite ) .",
    "the limited theoretical investigations of dsws in multiple dimensions @xcite and the experimental realization of multi - dimensional dsws in ultracold atoms as superfluid matter waves @xcite and in nonlinear optical diffraction patterns @xcite provides motivation for this study of two - dimensional dsws .",
    "furthermore , with the exception of recent studies on kadomtsev - petviashvili and related ( 2 + 1)d equations @xcite , the remaining previous theoretical works invoke asymptotic reductions to the korteweg - de vries or ( 1 + 1)d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations .",
    "these equations complete integrability enables a detailed analytical description via the existence of riemann invariants for the associated whitham modulation equations .",
    "whitham theory is applicable to a much wider class of equations and a description of salient dsw features is possible by making a simple wave assumption @xcite . in this article , we use simple wave dsw theory ( dsw fitting @xcite ) to construct large amplitude , spatial oblique dsws for the two - dimensional , time - independent ( 2 + 0)d nls equation .",
    "a spatial oblique dsw inhabits a wedge region in the plane filled with stationary , modulated periodic waves .",
    "the bounding angles of the oblique dsw are completely determined by the upstream mach number and the downstream flow angle .",
    "consequently , this asymptotic solution can be applied to the problem of supersonic flow over a corner .",
    "we investigate the dynamical stability of an oblique dsw for the corner problem , numerically observing instability . utilizing the instability theory of oblique dark nls solitons @xcite , we classify the convective or absolute nature of the instability .",
    "the former provides an effective dynamical stabilization of the oblique dsw near the apex of the corner . because the 2d nls equation is an accurate model of nonlinear optical and matter wave dynamics , among other systems , these results exhibit wide application .      generally , whitham averaging for an @xmath0 order ( 1 + 1)d dispersive wave equation proceeds in several steps",
    "the first requirement is an @xmath1-parameter family of periodic traveling wave solutions .",
    "the period and frequency of oscillation determines a length and time scale associated with dispersively initiated dynamic processes .",
    "whitham theory then proceeds by assuming the existence of larger modulation length and time scales on which the traveling wave s parameters adiabatically vary .",
    "the first order , quasi - linear modulation equations for these parameters can be determined by averaging @xmath2 conservation laws associated to the dispersive wave equation .",
    "the system is closed by an additional modulation equation , known as the conservation of waves , that results from a consistency condition inherent to the assumption of adiabatic parametric evolution . an important property required for modulational stability of the traveling wave",
    "is hyperbolicity of the modulation equations .",
    "if the whitham modulation equations exhibit singularity formation , modulations of quasi - periodic or multiphase solutions may be used , if they exist . in this work",
    ", we apply this same procedure to a @xmath3 order dispersive ( 2 + 0)d spatial system .",
    "one of the spatial variables can be viewed as a time - like variable hence , all of the whitham machinery applies .",
    "regularization of gradient catastrophe in dispersive hydrodynamics can be asymptotically described utilizing whitham theory .",
    "away from dsws , the solution is slowly varying and can be approximately described by the dispersionless equations ( dispersionless zone ) .",
    "shock formation gives rise to the development of oscillations characterized by a modulated traveling wave ( oscillation zone ) .",
    "the interfaces between the oscillation and dispersionless zones are unknowns that must be determined along with the solution . within the oscillation ( dispersionless ) zone ,",
    "the whitham ( dispersionless ) equations are solved .",
    "the two zones are matched at their free boundaries by equating the averaged solution to the dispersionless solution and requiring that either the oscillation amplitude goes to zero ( harmonic limit ) or the oscillation period goes to infinity ( soliton limit ) .",
    "admissibility criteria analogous to entropy conditions for classical shock waves determine the appropriate limiting behavior .",
    "thus a complete asymptotic description of dispersive hydrodynamics involves the determination of the space - time dynamics of all the modulation parameters and the boundaries between oscillation and dispersionless zones .",
    "this construction may appear to be complex and , perhaps , just as involved as solving the original evolution equation .",
    "if one seeks the complete description , this is a challenging problem indeed .",
    "however , often one is only interested in the macroscopic physical dsw properties encapsulated by the locations ( dsw speeds ) and limiting behavior ( harmonic or soliton ) of the free boundaries . for riemann step initial data ,",
    "a dsw fitting method is available under modest assumptions @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the dsw speeds and edge properties can be found by integrating two ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that involve only the dispersionless characteristic speeds and the dispersion relation .",
    "the integration of the full whitham equations is not required . in this work ,",
    "we utilize the dsw fitting method for oblique , spatial nls dsws .",
    "we remark that this problem utilizes an unconventional application of whitham theory . in typical problems , there is either a scalar or system of two governing equations . here , we have three governing equations , with one of them defining an algebraic relationship in the dispersionless limit .",
    "one scenario leading to dispersive hydrodynamic singularity formation is a large disturbance , say , in the fluid density . through a process of self - steepening and dispersive",
    "regularization , the disturbance results in unsteady dsws , which are typically realized along one spatial dimension . the analytical description of dsws was pioneered by gurevich and pitaevskii @xcite through the use of whitham averaging theory @xcite .",

    ", cavitating dsws were shown to no longer exhibit a dark soliton edge @xcite .",
    "rather , the edge is described by a non - modulated periodic wavetrain adjacent to a modulated region whose envelope decays to the harmonic wave edge .",
    "while the simulations depicted in [ fig : phase_diagram ] show the distinction between convective and absolute instability , longer time dsw stability can be more complicated . in the case of convective instability , a large number of vortices are generated and are initially convected away from the corner .",

    "this results in wave generation that can eventually propagate throughout the dsw , effectively rendering it unstable for long enough evolution time .",
    "one way to avoid this effect is to terminate the ramp at some finite distance away from the corner so that the generated vortices do not reflect off the boundary .",
    "this is what was done for the example identified by the filled circle in [ fig : phase_diagram ] where the ramp was terminated at @xmath244 .",
    "we have constructed the theory of steady , oblique , two - dimensional spatial dispersive shock waves ( dsws ) in the framework of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "this problem is of fundamental interest as a dispersive counterpart of the classical gas dynamics problem but also is motivated by actual physical applications in superfluid dynamics and nonlinear optics where the nls equation is an accurate mathematical model .",
    "the prototypical flow past corner problem has been considered that elucidates the key properties of steady oblique dsws .",
    "the main development of the paper is that the theory has been constructed for general supersonic flows , without additional simplifying assumptions ( small corner angle or highly supersonic oncoming flow ) enabling one to asymptotically reduce the description of steady oblique dsws to solving a riemann problem for an integrable equation : either kdv or ( 1 + 1)d nls @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the full ( 2 + 0)d defocusing nls equation is not integrable and also exhibits a number of qualitative , structural differences compared to the above asymptotic ( 1 + 1)d models .",

    "the main restrictions include causality inequalities and the condition of genuine nonlinearity of the modulation equations .",
    "an additional restriction of the simple wave dsw theory specific to the defocusing ( 2 + 0)d nls equation is the requirement of the absence of dsw cavitation . for sufficiently large flow deflection angles ,",
    "an additional wave structure exhibiting points of zero density in the region adjacent to the corner can occur .",
    "importantly , admissible stationary oblique dsws exhibit instability , either convective or absolute .",
    "the convectively unstable dsws are effectively stable in the laboratory reference frame @xcite and so can be manifested in an experiment , although a full dsw stability theory has not yet been developed .",
    "convective instability is a unique property of steady oblique 2d dsws which contrasts them to their unsteady 1d counterparts , which are always stable . when the mach number of the downstream flow is smaller than a critical value @xmath245 , the convective instability is replaced by absolute instability and further , by a non - causal , subsonic regime .",
    "the boundaries of the regions in the @xmath246 phase plane corresponding to the various oblique dsw generation regimes have been identified numerically .",
    "the constructed theory of stationary oblique dsws suggests several directions of further research",
