    "one of the most important feature of disordered systems is that they may present states that have an energy very close to the ground state energy but which are very different from the ground state in configuration space . for the spin - glasses , the debate between the droplet and replica theories concerns the probabilities and the properties of these states . in the droplet theory @xcite ,",
    "the low - temperature physics is described in terms of rare regions with nearly degenerate excitations which appear with a probability that decays with a power - law of their size . in the replica theory @xcite ,",
    "the replica symmetry breaking is interpreted as the presence of many pure states in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. the nearly degenerate ground states appear with a finite probability for arbitrary large size .    more generally , the statistical properties of the nearly degenerate excitations ( their numbers , their sizes , their geometric properties , the barriers separating them , etc ... ) are interesting in any disordered system , since they govern all properties at very low temperature",
    ". in particular , a linear behavior in temperature of the specific heat @xmath1 seems rather generic for a large class of disordered models , ranging from spin - glasses where this behavior is measured experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite , to one - dimensional classical spin models where this behavior can be exactly computed via the dyson - schmidt method @xcite .",
    "this linear behavior of the specific heat has been also obtained recently for classical disordered elastic systems via the replica variational method @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the infinite - ranged spin glass models are anomalous since the first term of the specific heat is only of order @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the leading term of the specific heat at low temperature has also been studied recently in various quantum disordered models , and is still under debate between linear @xmath3 @xcite , quadratic @xmath4 @xcite and cubic @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the linear behavior of the specific heat ( [ clinear ] ) is of course reminiscent of the same behavior in ordinary glasses , where the usual description involves a phenomenological theory of two - level systems @xcite . whereas the identification of these two - level systems in a microscopic theory has remained problematic for structural glasses ( see @xcite for recent discussions ) , this problem seems simpler in disordered models , where concrete proposals have been made . in the context of spin - glasses for instance @xcite ,",
    "it has been proposed a long time ago that the two - level excitations are clusters of spins that can be flipped with respect to the ground state , and that the associated joint probability @xmath6 of the energy @xmath7 and barrier @xmath8 determines various static and dynamical properties at very low temperature @xcite .",
    "however , the computation of this probability distribution @xmath6 is difficult except for very small clusters containing only a few spins @xcite .",
    "this is why the statistics of large excitations relies on some scaling assumptions in the droplet theory @xcite . in recent years",
    ", there has been a lot of numerical efforts to characterize the distribution and the topology of these large low - energy excitations @xcite .",
    "there exists a special class of disordered models for which exact remarkable identities for thermal fluctuations have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of these models have a deterministic part which consists in quadratic interactions and a random part whose statistics is translation invariant .",
    "the simplest of these systems is the so called toy model @xcite defined by the one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath9 where the random potential @xmath10 is a brownian motion presenting the correlations @xmath11 the statistical tilt symmetry leads to the following result for the generating function of thermal cumulants averaged over the disorder @xcite @xmath12 this identity is particularly interesting at very low temperature , since it predicts a linear behavior in @xmath0 of the second cumulant . in a previous work @xcite , we have explicitly shown that the rare configurations with two nearly degenerate minima @xmath13 actually give the full exact second cumulant of ( [ gentoy ] ) .",
    "the statistical tilt symmetry is also present in the models of directed polymers in random media , and we refer the reader to the references @xcite for a detailed discussion of the identities on thermal fluctuations and their interpretation in terms of nearly degenerate paths .      the above presentation on the properties of disordered systems at very low temperature ,",
    "although very incomplete , already shows that generically , various observables exhibit variations at order @xmath0 in temperature , that can be related to the statistical properties of nearly degenerate excitations .",
    "the aim of this paper is to revisit this question in some one - dimensional models to identify precisely the ` two - level ' excitations and their statistical properties , in order to compare their contribution to various observables at order @xmath0 with the rigorous results that can be obtained independently .",
    "we will first consider the equilibrium of a particle in random potentials of the following form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the non - random part of the hamiltonian , and where the random potential @xmath10 is a brownian potential ( [ corre ] ) .",
    "as explained above , the toy model @xmath16 is very special since it satisfies exact identities ( [ gentoy ] ) as a consequence of the statistical tilt symmetry .",
    "here we show that for a large class of deterministic part @xmath15 , the following temperature expansion holds for the generating function of thermal cumulants @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the disorder average of the position @xmath19 where @xmath20 is minimum , and where @xmath21 is the probability to have two degenerate minima in the system separated by a distance @xmath22 .",
    "the thermal fluctuations of these models are thus directly related to the presence of metastable states in rare disordered samples . in particular",
    ", the susceptibility @xmath23 has for average a finite value at zero - temperature @xmath24 but only the samples with two nearly degenerate minima contribute to this zero - temperature value .",
    "the typical samples with only one minimum have a susceptibility that vanishes at zero temperature .",
    "this type of behavior was found numerically for the random directed polymer model @xcite .",
    "we will show that the relation ( [ identitylowt ] ) is in full agreement with the exact results corresponding to the two soluble cases + ( i ) the pure brownian potential @xmath25 on a finite interval @xmath26 $ ] ; + ( ii ) the biased brownian potential @xmath27 on the semi - infinite line @xmath28 .",
    "we will then consider the one - dimensional random field ising model , in the regime where the imry - ma length @xmath29 representing the typical domain size at zero temperature is large .",
    "in contrast with models ( [ 1dmodels ] ) with only one degree of freedom , where the low - temperature properties are governed by the rare _ samples _ having two nearly degenerate ground states , the systems with many degrees of freedom are well described by disorder averaged values in the thermodynamic limit , since the average over the disorder is like a spatial average . as a consequence ,",
    "the low temperature properties are governed by the rare _ regions _ that presents nearly degenerate excitations .",
    "we describe in detail the rare nearly degenerate excitations and evaluate their contribution to the low temperature behavior of various observables .",
    "the density @xmath30 of excitations of length @xmath31 contains two contributions , involving either a single domain wall , that has two nearly degenerate optimal positions , or a pair of neighboring domain walls , than can appear or disappear with almost no energy cost .",
    "our analysis allows to obtain that the specific heat @xcite @xmath32 is dominated by small non - universal excitations of length @xmath33 , that depend on the details of the disorder distribution , whereas the edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath34 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath35 are dominated by large excitations whose length @xmath31 is of order of the imry - ma length @xmath29 , and whose properties are universal with respect to the initial disorder distribution , since they only depend upon its variance .",
    "we will then compare with the exact results available from the dyson - schmidt method @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section [ secparticle ] is devoted to the equilibrium at low temperature in the one - dimensional potentials ( [ 1dmodels ] ) .",
    "the section [ secrfim ] concerns the analysis of two - level excitations in the random field ising chain , and their influence on various observables .",
    "the appendix [ purepath ] contains some exact results on thermal cumulants in the brownian potential , that are useful to show the exactness of the two - level description presented in section [ secparticle ] .",
    "in typical samples with hamiltonian ( [ 1dmodels ] ) , there is only one minimum . in @xcite",
    ", it was moreover shown that the typical extension of the boltzmann distribution around a minimum for a pure brownian potential is given by the thermal length @xmath36 , that comes from the boltzmann factor @xmath37 with the typical behavior @xmath38 .",
    "for the other models ( [ 1dmodels ] ) with regular deterministic part , the leading behavior at small distance is still given by the brownian potential @xmath10 , and thus the same argument can be applied . as a consequence , for all potentials ( [ 1dmodels ] ) , the typical fluctuations around a minimum are of order @xmath39 at low temperature , and thus do not contribute at order @xmath0 .     and @xmath40 .",
    "the low temperature equilibrium properties are completely determined by the probability @xmath21 over the samples that there exist two nearly degenerate minima separated by a distance @xmath22.,height=226 ]    we now consider the configurations presenting two almost degenerate minima @xmath41 situated at @xmath42 and @xmath40 : see figure [ rareb ] . to compute their contribution at order @xmath0",
    ", we may neglect the spatial extension of order @xmath43 around each minimum , and replace the thermal measure by two delta peaks @xmath44 the respective boltzmann weights @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the small energy difference between the two minima .",
    "since we are interested in a window of size @xmath49 , as @xmath50 , the probability to have two almost degenerate minima situated at @xmath42 and @xmath40 with an energy difference @xmath51 can be considered to be uniform in the energy leading to the approximation @xmath52 . here",
    "we choose the convention that @xmath53 is of arbitrary sign . then to avoid double counting",
    ", we define @xmath42 as the true minimum , so that @xmath54 . as in the study of the rare events in @xcite",
    ", the average over @xmath51 of the quantities of interest can be performed by integrating over @xmath55 .",
    "more precisely , we introduce the symbol @xmath56 to denote the following average over configurations with two degenerate minima @xmath57    at this point , it is important to stress here that the measure @xmath58 is not normalizable , in the sense that @xmath59 diverges , but has only a meaning when the observable @xmath60 vanishes when only one minimum exists , that is for @xmath61 or for @xmath62 . as first examples of the measure defined above ,",
    "let us compute the lower cumulants of the position .",
    "the variable @xmath63 is @xmath64 with probability @xmath45 and @xmath65 with probability @xmath46 , leading to @xmath66 similarly , the fourth cumulant @xmath67 can be computed as follows @xmath68 the vanishing result is thus the consequence of a special cancellation of two terms of order @xmath0 .",
    "these cancellations actually occur at all orders , as already noted in @xcite for the random directed polymer model .",
    "we now present a proof within the effective model ( [ zeff ] ) .",

    "the conclusion is thus that the exact identities for the thermal cumulants ( [ gentoy ] ) derived from the statistical ` tilt ' symmetry @xcite are in fact true at order @xmath0 for all the models ( [ 1dmodels ] ) that do not present the statistical tilt symmetry .",
    "similarly , the even moments of @xmath63 have the following small - t expansion @xmath78 ( x_1-x_2)^{2k }   > >   + o(t^2 ) \\\\ % & & = \\int dx_1 \\int dy p(e=0,x_1,x_1+y ) y^{2k } % \\int_0^{+\\infty } de   \\frac{e^{- e / t } + e^{- 2 k e / t } } { ( 1 + e^{- e / t})^{2k+1 } }   \\\\ & & = \\frac{t}{k } \\int_0^{+\\infty } y^{2k } d(y ) + o(t^2 ) \\label{momentslowt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is defined as in ( [ defd ] ) .",
    "so the whole distribution @xmath21 is important to characterize the low temperature properties .",
    "the comparison with ( [ identitylowt ] ) shows that there are a lot of cancellations in the disorder averages of the cumulants .",
    "this phenomenon was already emphasized in @xcite for the random directed polymer .",
    "another interesting observables are the ` chaos observables ' that contain information about the configurational changes induced by temperature shifts .",
    "for instance , among the various chaos observables that have been discussed for the sinai model @xcite , the following quantity @xmath79 characterizes the change in the mean thermal position between two temperatures .",
    "again , at order @xmath0 in temperature , this quantity will be governed by configurations with two nearly degenerate minima @xmath80 more generally , higher moments have the following temperature expansion @xmath81 where @xmath82    one can also compute , in the limit where @xmath83 is fixed and @xmath84 @xmath85 with @xmath86 in particular , for a small change @xmath87 , the change in position is characterized by the moments @xmath88      all quantities at order @xmath0 in temperature may thus be exactly computed with the simple effective thermal measure ( [ zeff ] ) where the statistics of the parameters @xmath89 is defined by ( [ stat ] ) . for the case of the ` toy model ' ( quadratic well plus brownian potential ) , which present the ` statistical tilt symmetry ' we have already studied in @xcite the configurations with two nearly degenerate minima and showed that they give the exact result at order @xmath0 for the generating function of thermal cumulants .",
    "we will now consider models which do not present the statistical tilt symmetry .",

    "the physics is completely different , because the nearly degenerate excitations that exist for continuous distributions become now exact degeneracies : the entropy thus become finite at zero temperature @xcite , instead of a unique ground state , but now there is a gap in low - energy excitations @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have shown explicitly on two kinds of 1d disordered models how the analysis of the low - temperature properties in terms of two - level excitations allows to fully recover the exact results obtained independently .",
    "in particular , we have obtained that the thermal fluctuations of a particle in 1d random potentials are entirely due to the rare samples presenting two nearly degenerate minima , whereas the properties of the random field ising chain are controlled by the rare regions that can coherently flip with a vanishing energy cost .",
    "we have also explained how the identities on thermal cumulants that are valid for systems presenting a statistical tilt symmetry @xcite actually hold more generally for various observables at order @xmath0 in temperature , as a result of the statistical properties of two - level excitations .",
    "finally , for the random - field ising chain , our analysis shed light on the influence of small / large excitations on various observables : the specific heat is dominated by small non - universal excitations that are more numerous , whereas the the susceptibility and the edwards - anderson order parameter are dominated by universal large excitations , whose length is of order imry - ma length : these excitations are rarer than the small ones , but involve a larger number of spins .    in conclusion ,",
    "since the phenomenology of two - level excitations is very often advocated in the field of disordered systems , we hope that the present detailed study on 1d models is useful to strengthen these ideas .",
    "moreover , since the identification of the sample - dependent two - level excitations and the characterization of their statistical properties leads to a very clear picture of the low temperature physics , we hope that other disordered systems will be analyzed in the same way in the future .",
