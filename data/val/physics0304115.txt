    "the unique properties of the helium systems at low temperature have attracted a continuous experimental and theoretical interest in the investigation of their ground state potential energy.@xcite in the past , the construction of the best potentials used semi - empirical methods where some parameters were obtained by fits to experimental data .",
    "one of them , the so called hfdhe2 potential of aziz and collaborators,@xcite has allowed the understand of many properties of helium in the condensed phases.@xcite despite of small inconsistencies in this potential , it was used during a long time in these studies .",
    "it was attractive to use an effective pair - wise additive potential and avoid considering high - order interactions among the atoms .    in the last decade ,",
    "after a bound helium dimer was observed,@xcite great efforts were applied to develop _ ab initio _ methods in the description of he - he potentials.@xcite this approach was very successful ; interacting energies calculated using infinite order symmetry adapted perturbation theory , green s function monte carlo results and accurate dispersion coefficients were fitted to a tang - tonnies model @xcite and produced @xcite to date the best characterization of the helium potential energy.@xcite    the use of very accurate two - body potential energies , like those offered by the _ ab initio _ potentials , in the investigation of bulk helium , uncovered what was known for a long time : the correct description of many of its properties requires more general many - body potential . among the many recent works where this situation was observed , we cite refs .",
    "the first attempt to incorporate long range three - body interactions were made by axilrod - teller@xcite and muto.@xcite they used third order perturbation theory to calculate the triple - dipole dispersion energy for spherical symmetric atoms .",
    "effects of three - body exchange of electrons in trimers of helium started 10 years latter by rosen@xcite using a valance bond approach . since the work of jansen and collaborators @xcite it is conjectured that three - body exchange energy is needed to understand the energy difference between the fcc and hcp crystalline structure .",
    "many developments occurred in the investigation of nonadditive effects are reviewed in ref .",
    "it is known that two - body interactions favor the hcp over the fcc structure .",
    "the hcp crystalline lattice is about 0,01% more stable than the corresponding fcc structure.@xcite the two - body interaction potentials of the rare gas in general are very well known and the residuals errors associated to them can not be responsible for discrepancies in the calculated ground state energy and in the favored crystalline structure . at low temperatures",
    "all rare gas solids , but helium , crystallizes in a fcc lattice . to overcome these discrepancies higher order interactions need to be considered .",
    "the inclusion of triple - dipole interaction improved the agreement between the experimental and theoretical values of the ground state energy , but still left the hcp as the more estable structure .",
    "the inclusion of higher order terms in the dispersion energy like dipole - octopole and quadrupole - quadrupole terms did not modify the theoretical results significantly .",
    "so far , the proposed higher - order interactions greater than three - body have given no significant contributions to the interatomic potential .",
    "in this context it is important to better understand the three - body exchange interaction and have at the same time reliable ways to compute its associate energy .",
    "as already mentioned , for the helium systems the largest and most well know part of the three - body interatomic potential is the triple - dipole term of axilrod - teller - muto .",
    "the exchange contribution is less known .",
    "it is much more weak than the dispersion energy and might be of importance in the crystallization process . despite of its importance , still now , competing calculations might differ by an order of magnitude @xcite and different potentials forms are used for fitting theoretical results obtained in calculations of the exchange energy .",
    "quantum monte carlo methods , where quantities of interest can be computed subject only to statistical uncertainties , can be very useful in the analysis and understanding of the different contributions to the potential energy .",
    "however straightforward use of these methods to compute small energies differences might not be possible .",
    "results of independent runs and their associate statistical uncertainties might render a simple energy difference meaningless .",
    "perturbation methods used together with quantum monte carlo methods still needs extrapolation @xcite that introduces further uncertainties .    to be able to compute energies subject only to statistical uncertainties ( avoiding extrapolation )",
    "is not only a matter of principle but a necessity in the present case , where we have a delicate balance between energies",
    ". a better understanding of the individual contributions of the three - body interactions are important by themself and moreover can increase the physical content of the analytical functional forms used to fit their contributions .    in this work ,",
    "we have applied a recent two - body potential @xcite together with the three - body potential of cohen and murrell @xcite to describe properties of bulk @xmath0 . by developing an extension of the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc )",
    "method we are able to compute and analyze the individual contributions of the coulomb and exchange terms of the three - body interactions.the effect of these contributions are considered in the equation of state and quantitative results show how they affect the ground - state energy , the equilibrium , melting and freezing densities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in the next section we present the hamiltonian together with the interacting potentials used in this work . in we briefly describe one of the standard implementation of the diffusion monte carlo algorithm , then we present an extension of this algorithm .",
    "it allows the use of a single set of walkers and reweighting to compute properties of a system of helium atoms described by different interacting potentials .",
    "section [ sec : sim ] contains details of our simulations ; the results are presented in .",
    "a discussion in concludes the work .",
    "the hamiltonian we use to describe the system of helium atoms is given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 stands for the @xmath3 coordinates of the helium atoms and @xmath4 is the interatomic potential . in this work",
    "three sets of calculations were performed . in the first one",
    "the interatomic potential employed is an additive pair - wise potential @xmath5 as proposed by aziz and co - works.@xcite in a second set , we considered the @xmath6 potential    @xmath7    obtained by adding to @xmath8 a damped axilrod - teller - mutto @xcite triple - dipole term ( @xmath9 )    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a constant , the @xmath12 are the internal angles of the triangle ( formed by the three particles ) and the @xmath13 the lengths of its sides .",
    "the damping @xmath14 is given by the product    @xmath15    that depends on    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are parameters .",
    "the damping of the dispersion energies at distances where charge overlap is significant is need for a reasonable description of the short range forces .",
    "the value used for @xmath11 in is 0.324 k , as obtained by double perturbation theory.@xcite    finally , the most complete interatomic potential we have considered ,    @xmath19    includes contributions from the exchange potential @xmath20 as well .",
    "the two last terms of form the three - body potential proposed by cohen and murrell.@xcite the potential @xmath20 is expressed through symmetry adapted coordinates @xmath21 ( linear combinations of the three distances @xmath13 )    @xmath22    its functional form is given by :    @xmath23{\\rm exp}(-\\alpha q_1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    that depends on parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in almost all practical implementations of the diffusion monte carlo method @xcite we compute quantities of interest by sampling the probability distribution @xmath26 that depends on @xmath27 , the true ground state wave function of the system and on a given guiding function , @xmath28 .",
    "a careful version of this method is presented by umrigar , nightingale and runge.@xcite a slight simpler implementation could be described as follow .",
    "it is convenient to start the calculation with a set of configurations draw from @xmath29 , obtained through the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the distribution @xmath30 is sampled after an initial transient , where the excited states components are filtered .",
    "all the sampling is accomplished iteratively through the integral equation    @xmath31    where    @xmath32,\\ ] ]    @xmath33    @xmath34 + \\triangle\\tau e_t\\ } , \\ ] ]    here @xmath35 is a trial energy and @xmath36 is the local energy given by    @xmath37    @xmath38 for a long enough @xmath39 goes to @xmath30 .",
    "it is correct to write the green s function as the product of only up to @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that to obtain exact results , within statistical fluctuations , short times @xmath41 must be used in the iterations and an extrapolation to @xmath42 performed ( see however comments in ) .",
    "this is the so called short - time approximation .",
    "each configuration undergoes three steps : drift , diffusion and branching .",
    "very frequently a single configuration is called a walker and an iteration of all walkers a generation . for the drift step",
    "we need to compute the quantum velocity @xmath43 . in the second step the configuration diffuses .",
    "this is accomplished by sampling @xmath44 accordingly , a walker in @xmath45 is propagated during a time step @xmath41 to its new point @xmath46 through    @xmath47    where @xmath48 are normal deviates of a gaussian function with variance @xmath49 and zero mean .    to propagate a walker",
    ", we can change all the particle s coordinates at once or those of a single particle at a time . in this last case",
    "we perform n updates to propagate each walker .",
    "to improve @xcite the approximation of the green s function , we only accept moves with probability    @xmath50\\ ] ]    and chose @xmath41 such that more than 99% of the attempted moves are accepted .",
    "this condition imposes detailed balance on the splited green s function and restores this property of the exact green s function .",
    "regardless of the time step , it guarantees also a correct sampling if hypothetically we could use as @xmath51 the exact ground state wavefunction . in such case , this implementation of the dmc method reduces to a variational monte carlo calculation with trial moves sampled from @xmath52 .    to complete the iteration of",
    ", we compute @xmath53 considered as a weight for the walker . at the begin of the simulation , all the walker s weights are assumed to be equal to one . in order to minimize fluctuations in @xmath53 ,",
    "an effective time step is used.@xcite it is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mean square displacement of all proposed moves in the diffusion step and @xmath56 is the related quantity when only accepted moves are considered .",
    "finally the weight @xmath57 of the walker is updated to its new value @xmath58 according to    @xmath59    after propagating all walkers we have a new generation and a sample of the probability distribution @xmath60 as an weighted average over the walkers . for reasons of efficiency",
    "the number of configurations used in the estimation of @xmath61 fluctuates according to the following branching rules .",
    "if @xmath58 is greater than 2 , the walker is duplicate and each one will carry half of its weight . on the other hand if two walkers , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , have weights less than 0.5 , only one survives with a weight given by @xmath64 .",
    "the decision of which one will survive is made by sampling @xmath65 .",
    "that is , we draw a random number @xmath66 and compare it with @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath67 is small than @xmath66 we keep configuration @xmath63 , otherwise @xmath62 is kept . if the weight computed by lies between 0.5 and 2 , a single copy of the walker with weight @xmath58 is kepted .",
    "the values of the weights where the branching is performed certainly could be changed , we only need rules that neither introduce bias or result in a scheme too inefficient .    the number of walkers is controlled by adjusting the value of @xmath35 .",
    "this number is kept roughly constant .",
    "we have experienced with both heuristic and automatic changes of @xmath35 as given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is a parameter , @xmath70 is the target population and @xmath71 the current population .",
    "adjustments in @xmath35 was made about once every 20 generations . for our purposes ,",
    "the results were equivalent for both methods of changing @xmath35 .",
    "in many situations it is interesting to compute energies differences resulting from different interatomic potentials .",
    "however it is not always possible to simply use results from independent runs to obtain such differences .",
    "if they are small , statistical fluctuations might well produce errors that are bigger than these differences themselves , rendering the result meaningless .",
    "it is however possible to modify the dmc method in such a way that the same set of walkers are used to compute quantities of interest associated to the different potentials we want to investigate .",
    "the energies that are obtained are correlated and thus more meaningful differences can be computed .",
    "no approximations are introduced . if the actual interest is on the energies , it is not necessary to use extrapolated estimators either .",
    "what we are proposing is to sample different probabilities distributions functions , associated to the different interatomic potentials we want to investigate , by using the same set of walkers with appropriate weights .",
    "as just mentioned , the values of the quantities of interest obtained are correlated and the errors associate with their difference reduced by orders of magnitude .",
    "we want to call attention to the fact that although our method relay in a set of weights it can not be related to the forward walking @xcite or reptation @xcite methods .",
    "always that we have a generation of equilibrated walkers , we can compute the quantities of interest without any further propagation .",
    "moreover the weights we have for a given walker are associate to different interatomic potentials .    in our modified dmc method , to each walker",
    "we attach a set of weights , one for each potential we want to consider . in our implementation of the algorithm",
    "we have attached three different weights for each walker , one for each of the three different interatomic potentials used .",
    "of course this number in the method is arbitrary .",
    "it was chosen because of the specific aspects of many - body interactions in the interatomic potential we want to investigate .",
    "it would be possible to use only two weights or any other convenient number of weights .",
    "as in the standard algorithm , the calculations start with a set of walkers draw from @xmath29 .",
    "since a single guide function is use , the drift and diffusion steps are performed exactly as before .",
    "we compute the drift velocity @xmath43 , generate the normal distribution of variates , update @xmath46 according to and accept it with probability @xmath72 of . in the present algorithm",
    ", we sample the three different probabilities distributions in which we are interested by completing the iteration considering three different @xmath53 , and updating the weights as follows .    to be specific let us consider a single walker just propagated to a new configuration @xmath46 .",
    "one of its weights , @xmath73 is associate with the local energies @xmath74 computed using only the aziz two - body potential @xmath8 in the hamiltonian of .",
    "the weight @xmath73 is updated according to by evaluating @xmath53 of using the local energy @xmath74 .",
    "another weight of the same walker , @xmath75 is calculated with the local energy @xmath76 computed with the hamiltonian that uses the @xmath6 potential of , it includes the triple - dipole contributions to the two - body potential .",
    "the calculation of the new value of @xmath75 for this walker proceeds as before .",
    "@xmath53 in is evaluated employing @xmath76 and the update finished according to .",
    "the third weight , @xmath77 , is associate to the interatomic potential that includes also exchange contributions .",
    "it is computed by considering @xmath78 that depends on the hamiltonian that uses the full potential @xmath79 of .",
    "the update of @xmath77 is performed along the exact same lines already describe for the other weights .",
    "the different values of the weights are due only to the local energy used in their computation ,",
    "_ i. e. _ , to the interatomic potential employed .",
    "we remember again that the same configuration is used to compute these three weights .    after propagating all walkers ,",
    "a new generation will finally be obtained by using the following branching rules .",
    "when @xmath80 is large than 2 the walker is duplicated and each one of the copies will carry half of the value of the weights : @xmath81 . if two walkers , @xmath82 and @xmath83 have weights such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are less than 0.3 , we consider each one of the weights individually .",
    "we draw a single random number @xmath66 and make comparisons of @xmath66 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",
    "three situations might happen : i ) in all the comparisons @xmath66 is smaller than @xmath90 , then we keep walker @xmath82 with weights @xmath91 and discard walker @xmath83 ;",
    "ii ) always @xmath66 is greater than @xmath90 , in this case we keep @xmath63 with the same sum of weights as above and discard @xmath62 ; iii ) one of the comparisons favors a walker different from the other two . for definiteness let say that @xmath66 is smaller than @xmath86 and greater than @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in this case",
    "we will keep the two walkers , @xmath62 with weights @xmath92 and @xmath63 with weights @xmath93 .",
    "these new weights are telling us that in fact we have deleted walker @xmath82 from the calculations with the interatomic potential that includes three - body interactions and walker @xmath83 when we are considering only the two - body potential .",
    "this is a bad situation in the sense that we are introducing two walkers in the calculations that will not give anymore the correlations that we are looking for .",
    "fortunately , if needed , the cases where this situation happens can be systematically reduced in a simple way .",
    "it is enough to decrease the threshold value used to combine walkers ( see ) .",
    "finally if one of the weights of a walker lies between 0.3 and 2 , a single copy is maintained with weights @xmath94 .",
    "it is useful to use only a single random number in the above comparisons . as expected each one of the calculations we are performing give exactly , within statistical fluctuations , the results obtained by the standard algorithm",
    "of course we could use three different random numbers in the comparison , however more frequently we would meet the unwanted situation described in iii ) of the last paragraph .    periodically , about one every four or five generations we compute several quantities of interest .",
    "evaluations of the energies @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are readily obtained as weighted averages that include all the walkers @xmath62 of the present generation :    @xmath98    together with these quantities we have also evaluated the energy associate only to the damped triple - dipole term in the interatomic potential    @xmath99    and the energy associate with the exchange term @xmath20    @xmath100    as already mentioned the computation of these values are straightforward because we have already estimates of the exact energies @xmath101 , no extrapolations are needed . along the runs , averages of these quantities are formed and their estimates and associate errors obtained .",
    "in the investigation of the properties of bulk helium we impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the cutoff convention , the distance beyond which a potential is set to zero , is enforced for all interactions at half of the box size , @xmath102 .",
    "distances between pairs of particles are computed by the minimum - image convention . when considering three - body interatomic interactions , the length of the third side of the triangles formed by the particles can not in general be computed using the minimum - image convention .",
    "a modification needs to be introduced so that the length of this side can be computed in a proper way and discarded if greater than @xmath102 . to be specific",
    "let us consider particles @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath18 .",
    "we compute distances @xmath13 and @xmath103 using the minimum - image convention .",

    "if the difference @xmath109 of the third side is computed as @xcite    @xmath110    it is not hard to see that all possibilities in the simulation box are taken into account and the right value of the distance can be obtained .",
    "if this value is little than @xmath102 the calculation for this triangle proceeds . for the @xmath111 and @xmath112 coordinates a similar approach is used and then the three - body interaction is computed if all sides for this triangle are lower than @xmath102 .",
    "the calculation continues until all triangles have been considered .",
    "the diffusion monte carlo calculations started with an initial set of 400 configurations , previously draw from @xmath29 using the metropolis algorithm . before accumulating quantities of interest the excited states components of our ensemble of configurations",
    "are filtered by performing several iterations of .",
    "this  equilibration \" is typically of the order of 400 generations , and depends on the system density .",
    "we study the liquid phase using a guiding function of the jastrow form    @xmath113    where the factor @xmath114 explicitly correlates pairs of particles through a pseudopotential of the mcmillan form @xmath115 ; @xmath116 is a parameter .    for the solid phase we have used a nosanov - jastrow    @xmath117    guiding function , where    @xmath118\\ ] ]",
    "is a mean field term that localizes the particles around the given lattice sites @xmath119 .",
    "all guiding functions were previously optimized by performing variational calculations .",
    "although this is a convenient way of obtaining the values of the parameters , in principle they could be obtained without performating such calculations .",
    "it would be enough to chose parameters values that give the fastest filtering of the excited states of the initial configurations .",
    "the time steps @xmath120 used in the calculations depends on the density .",
    "their values vary within the range 0.001 to 0.002 ( @xmath121 ) in order to obtain more than @xmath122 of acceptance of the attempted moves .",
    "we also observed that at this acceptance level , the extrapolation to @xmath42 of the energies values were in excellent agreement , within statistical fluctuations , to the actual values obtained in the calculation itself .",
    "the quantities reported in this work were obtained by forming averages with about 500 estimates .",
    "each estimate was performed after 4 generations .",
    "blocking was used in order to avoid correlations in the calculations of the variances .",
    "the number of walkers during the simulations did not change by more than 10% .",
    "we have considered systems with 108 particles in the solid phase . in the liquid phase we have considered 64 particles . at @xmath123 @xmath124 to estimate size effects we have also performed simulations with 108 particles .",
    "tail corrections of the two - body potential energy were made by assuming a pair distribution function equal to one beyond half the size of the simulation cell and integrating the potential up to infinity .",
    "no tail corrections were performed for the high - order interactions . for the axilrod - teller interaction ,",
    "the tail correction is less than 7% of its value at @xmath123 @xmath124 ( see next section and table ii ) .",
    "this value is in rough agreement with a previous estimate of this quantity.@xcite for the exchange energy the relative tail correction is bigger than the one of the dispersion energy .",
    "however it should remain within the statistical uncertainty of our results ( see tables i and ii ) .",
    "the situation where we have a walkers with one of its weights equal to zero destroys the correlation we want to construct . if we combine walkers when all their weights is less or equal 0.3 , we noticed that the number of walkers with at least one of weights equal zero does not exceed @xmath125 of their total number .",
    "if needed this fraction can be further and systematically reduced by using a threshold smaller than 0.3 to combine walkers . as we have observed in our calculations ,",
    "this is done at expense of a less efficient calculation .",
    "we have concluded that the threshold 0.3 for combination of walkers is perfectly reasonable for our purposes .",
    "we conducted several independent runs at four different densities @xmath126 of liquid helium , 19.64 @xmath124 , at the experimental equilibrium density @xmath123 @xmath124 , 24.01 @xmath124 and at 26.23 @xmath124 . in table",

    "we can believe that the results show their evolution as more elaborated interacting potentials are used , despite of the statistical uncertainties in the results .",
    "in table ii we shown very accurate calculations of the axilrod - teller and exchange energies at these four densities",
    ". for comparison we show also extrapolated results of perturbative calculations performed using configurations generated with the @xmath127 potential .",
    "we have plot these results in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the axilrod - teller energies calculated using reweighting are greater than the extrapolated perturbative results .",
    "moreover they do not always agree within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the triple - dipole interaction gives a positive contribution to the energy of the system and its value double when we go from the lowest to the highest density .",
    "the energies due to the exchange term in the @xmath79 potential when calculated with respect to the total energies obtained with the @xmath6 potential are on average about 0.0010 k smaller than the extrapolated perturbative results .",
    "in addition there is no agreement within statistical uncertainties between the energies calculated with the reweighting and perturbative methods at @xmath128 and @xmath129 @xmath130 .",
    "the energies calculated using reweighting are lower than the extrapolated perturbative results , contrary to what happens with the triple - dipole interaction .",
    "the exchange energy is also positive at all densities examined and increases with it . at the highest density",
    "it is approximately 50% greater than in the lowest one .      for the solid phase we have considered four densities : 29.34 , 32.88 , 33.54 and 35.27 @xmath124 . in table",
    "i are shown the total energies , obtained with a systems of 108 particles in a fcc structure .",
    "again , we have considered the potentials @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath79 . table ii shown our very accurate results of the axilrod - teller and exchange contributions to the potential energy and also extrapolated perturbative results for comparison .",

    "they also increase with the density . at the highest density ( 35.27 @xmath124 )",
    "it is 60% greater than in the lowest one .",
    "the contribution of the exchange term in the solid region is null or negative and differs significantly from the perturbative results . at the lowest density ( 29.34 @xmath124 ) the result obtained by reweighting",
    "gives a null contribution while the extrapolated perturbative quantity is positive .",
    "in the other densities the exchange energy computed by reweighting continues to be lower than the corresponding extrapolated perturbative values that are negative . in the solid phase the relative variation of the exchange energy is greater than the corresponding quantity for the damped axilrod - teller energy .      in order to follow the variations of the melting and freezing densities with the interacting potentials",
    ", we used a maxwell ( double - tangent ) construction in analytical equations of state for the liquid and crystalline phases .",
    "the equations were determined by fits of our results to functions of the form    @xmath131    this functional form has been extensively used in the literature , including to fit experimental equation of state.@xcite we have fitted equations of state using results from the three different potentials , @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath79 . the fitted parameters , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the liquid and solid phases are presented in table iii for these potentials . in fig .",
    "3 we display results for the equations of state for the three potentials .    the freezing and melting densities determined by the maxwell double tangent construction",
    "are listed in table iv .",
    "looking at this table , we can follow the changes in the freezing and melting densities as more elaborated interacting potentials are used .",
    "the computed freezing densities differs , about 3% from the experimental value .",
    "this difference is of about 4% for the melting densities .",
    "the calculated freezing densities are below the experimental value , contrary to the computed melting densities that are above the experimental value .",
    "in this work we are able to verify without any approximations how small changes in the interacting potential affects some of the properties of bulk helium .",
    "it was possible to analyze how the axilrod - teller and the exchange three - body contributions to the interatomic potential modify the equation of state of this system .",
    "this was accomplished by using a single set of walkers with reweighting in a dmc calculation .",
    "the quantities of interest associate with the different potentials were obtained in a correlated fashion and so despite of the statistical errors their difference are meaningful .",
    "the total energies per atom presented in table i show us that since our two - body potential is very accurate , high order terms in the description of the atomic interaction are needed . in the same token ,",
    "as the contributions of the dispersion energy are much better known than those of the exchange energy , the results suggest that more efforts would be desirable in developing reliable ways of computing the energies associated to this last kind of interaction .",
    "the results of the axilrod - teller triple - dipole dispersion energy and of the three - body exchange energy as a function of the density reported in table ii , figures 1 and 2 , show qualitative agreement between the two methods we use in the calculations .",
    "however the usual approach of extrapolating perturbative calculations ( made with configurations generated by the dmc method using a two - body potential ) not always can be trusted in giving the right magnitude of this quantity . in some cases the results do not agree within statistical uncertainty with those obtained using reweight .",
    "this might be due to the simple functions used for extrapolation : functions of the jastrow and jastrow - nosanov form , for the liquid and solid phases respectively .",
    "as expected , in both liquid and solid phases , the axilrod - teller term gives more important energy contribution to the total energy than the exchange term .",
    "also it is interesting to note that at the lowest solid density we have considered ( 29.34 @xmath130 ) , the extrapolated perturbative result associated with the exchange term gives a positive energy contribution whereas the value obtained by reweighting is null .",
    "although the inclusion of the three - body interaction potentials used in this paper do not greatly modifies the melting and freezing densities , it is important to note that our calculations show that the inclusion of the triple - dipole and the exchange terms , as proposed by cohen and murell,@xcite are leading the melting and freezing densities to their right values .",
    "all the small differences we observe in these quantities are within their estimate error ( 0.2 @xmath124 ) .",
    "however since we used a single set of walkers to compute them , we can trust that their relative difference are significant in our calculations",
    ". other consequence of including many body interactions in the potential can be seen in the calculation of the equilibrium density ( table iii , ) .",
    "for both potentials , @xmath6 and @xmath79 , the theoretical computed value of the equilibrium density becomes almost identical to the experimental value .",
    "the equilibrium density obtained using the full interatomic potential @xmath79 diminished 0.3 @xmath130 from its value computed with the two - body potential . in the solid phase ,",
    "in which the contribution of the exchange energy is greater , the parameter @xmath135 decreases 0.75 @xmath130 in a similar comparison .",
    "the inclusion of three - body terms in the interatomic potential improves the agreement between computed and experimental values of properties like the binding energy , the equilibrium , melting and freezing densities .",
    "the results suggest that more reliable analytical expressions are needed for the calculation of the exchange energy in bulk helium .",
    "we could reach these conclusions by introducting reweighting in a dmc calculation , where a single set of walkers is used to compute properties associated to different potentials .",
    "moreover we are able to calculate the energies associated to these potentials without extrapolation .",
    "the extension we have proposed to the dmc method might be very useful not only for the helium systems , but also for other quantum many - body systems where a clue is need to identify the best description between competing interacting potentials . even if these potentials differ by very small amounts , the nature of the interactions they describe can be different . a better understanding of these differences and their relevance will enlarge our knowledge about the interactions and so about these systems themselves .",
    "the questions discussed in this work are not the only instance where the reweighting technique might be useful .",
    "the calculations of small energy contributions of spin - orbit terms in molecular physics@xcite might be another situation where this method can help in a better understanding of a physical system .",
