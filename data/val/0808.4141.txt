    "accretion flows imbedding a shock wave have attracted much attention of researchers .",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities of shocked accretion flows may explain the time variability of emissions from many black hole candidates , since a shock wave is a promising mechanism of transforming the gravitational energy into radiation .",
    "the possibility that a shock exists in black hole accretion disks was first suggested by @xcite even though they did not make clear the essential condition for its existence .",
    "the possible structure of the shocked accretion flows in equatorial plane was described by @xcite , who suggested the importance of the multiplicity of critical points for the existence of the standing shock .",
    "multiple critical points exist only for appropriate values of the injection parameters such as the specific angular momentum and bernoulli constant .",
    "note also that there are generally two possible shock locations , which are referred to as the inner and outer shocks .",
    "the stability of the standing shock wave in the accretion flows has been also investigated by many authors both analytically and numerically .",
    "@xcite showed by linear analysis in the equatorial plane that if the post - shock matter are accelerated , the flow is unstable against radial perturbations , which is true for both newtonian or general relativistic dynamics . as a result of this theorem",
    ", we know for the black hole accretion that the inner shock becomes generally unstable against radial perturbations and that non - rotating steady accretion flows to a black hole can not have a stable standing shock wave in it .",
    "these features were also observed in 1d axisymmetric simulations for a pseudo - newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out by linear analysis that the outer shock wave , which is stable against radial perturbations , is in fact unstable to non - radial axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "he argued that the advective - acoustic cycle could be responsible for the instability .",
    "in this mechanism the velocity and entropy fluctuations initially generated at the shock are advected inwards , producing pressure perturbations , which then propagate outwards , reach the shock and generate entropy and velocity fluctuations there , thus repeating the cycle with an increased amplitude .",
    "the same instability appears to be working in the accretion flows onto a nascent proto neutron star in the supernova core , in which large scale oscillations of the shock wave of @xmath0 nature are observed @xcite , where @xmath1 stands for the index in the spherical harmonic functions @xmath2 . although the mechanism is still controversial @xcite , the so - called standing accretion shock instability or sasi is currently attracting much attention as a promising explanation of asymmetric explosion of supernova as well as young pulsars proper motions @xcite and spins @xcite .",
    "as for the stability of the shock wave against non - axisymmetric perturbations , @xcite did 2d simulations of an adiabatic shocked accretion flow by using the pseudo - newtonian potential and found a non - axisymmetric instability .",
    "they showed that the shock instability is saturated at a low level and a new quasi - steady asymmetric configuration is realized . to investigate the mechanism of this instability",
    ", @xcite performed linear analysis for both isothermal and adiabatic flows .",
    "they concluded that the instability seems to be of the papaloizou - pringle type and the repeated propagations of acoustic waves between the corotation radius and the shock surface are a driving mechanism .",
    "these conclusions are based on the wkb approximation and the comparison between the growth rate and the acoustic cycle period .",
    "it is also noted that @xcite investigated the linear stability of the shocked accretion flows onto the proto neutron star against non - axisymmetric perturbations in the equatorial plane .",
    "they demonstrated that the counter - rotating spiral modes are significantly damped , whereas the growth rate of the corotating modes is increased by rotation .",
    "they also claimed that the instability is not of the papaloizou - pringle type , since the stability is not affected by the presence or absence of the corotation point .",
    "instead , they suggested the advective - acoustic cycle based on the wkb analysis .",
    "the purely acoustic cycles was found to be stable .    as mentioned above ,",
    "although many efforts have been made for clarifying the non - radial instability , the complete understanding of the mechanism is still elusive .",
    "it is noted that the unperturbed accretion flows should be treated properly , since they strongly affect the instability . in black hole accretions ,",
    "the gravitation is one of the main factors to determine the flow features such as sonic points and shock locations .",
    "so far , however , the shock stability in the accretion flows to black holes has been investigated under the newtonian or pseudo - newtonian approximation and there has been no fully gr treatment .",
    "as shown later , the range of injection parameters that allows the existence of a standing shock wave is changed substantially when gr is fully taken into account .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate fully general relativistically the stability of the shock in the advection - dominated accretion flows into a schwarzschild black hole by using both linear analysis and non - linear dynamical simulations . in so doing , we consider only the equatorial plane , assuming that the @xmath3-component of four - velocity ( @xmath4 ) and all the @xmath3-derivatives are vanishing .",
    "we use the spherical coordinates ( @xmath5 ) in the following .",
    "the evolution of the metric is not taken into account , which is justified if the mass of accretion flow is much smaller than the black hole mass .",
    "we show that the shock is indeed unstable against non - axisymmetric perturbations and a spiral arm structure is formed as the instability grows .",
    "we discuss the instability mechanisms comparing various time scales .",
    "finally , we mention possible implications of our findings for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and black hole quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the steady axisymmetric accretion flows with a shock in them . in section 3 , we present the formulation of linear analysis . the numerical method for dynamical simulations",
    "is explained in section 4 .",
    "the main numerical results and their analyses are given in section 5 .",
    "the implication for grbs and black hole qpos are mentioned in section 6 .",
    "finally we summarize and conclude the paper in section 7 .",
    "one of the key features of the accretion flows to black holes is that the inflow velocity is supersonic at the event horizon .",
    "this immediately means that there should be at least two sonic points if a steady shock wave exists in the accretion flows , since both the pre- and post - shock flows are transonic .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the accretions onto a neutron star , in which the post shock flow is subsonic .",
    "one of the consequences of this theorem is the fact that spherical adiabatic accretions into schwarzschild black holes are unable to have a steady shock wave in them , since they have a single sonic point .",
    "as long as rotating accretion flows in the equatorial plane are concerned , the locations of these sonic points are determined by the adiabatic index and injection parameters , such as the bernoulli constant and specific angular momentum .",
    "note that the accretion rate is irrelevant for the locations of sonic points and standing shocks .",
    "the basic equations are the relativistic continuity equation and equation of energy - momentum conservations : @xmath6 where the greek indices represent the spacetime components . as already mentioned , we consider the accretions only in the equatorial plane , assuming @xmath3-component of velocity ( @xmath4 ) and all @xmath3 derivatives are vanishing",
    ". then the basic equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations with respect to the radial coordinate : @xmath7 note that these treatments are slightly different from those by @xcite .",
    "they employed the cylindrical coordinates and integrated out the vertical structures , thus considering the accretion flows only in the equatorial plane . on the other hand ,",
    "we use the spherical coordinates in this paper , since it is mathematically more convenient for the fully general relativistic approach . because of this difference , however , the obtained accretion flows would be different from the ones considered in this paper if the general relativity were taken into account in their formulations .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ tefig1 ] shows the locations of the sonic points in schwarzschild black hole as a function of the bernoulli constant and specific angular momentum ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in the figure , there are indeed two or three sonic points for some combinations of the bernoulli constant and angular momentum .",
    "the maximum and minimum specific angular momenta are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , for the bernoulli constant @xmath10 , for example .",
    "it should be noted that one of the most important differences between the full gr and the pseudo - newtonian treatments is the range of the injection parameters that allows the existence of multiple sonic points .",
    "as the bernoulli constant becomes smaller , the maximum specific angular momentum gets larger without limit for the pseudo newtonian case whereas it is bounded for the full gr case . for the bernoulli constant that may be typical for massive stellar collapse",
    ", e.g. @xmath11 , the maximum specific angular momentum is larger by about 60% for the pseudo newtonian approximation than for the full gr treatment .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the gravity nearby the black hole is too strong in the pseudo - newtonian approximation .",
    "it should be pointed out that the region of the injection parameters that allows multiple sonic points is not very wide and the above - mentioned difference may be important in considering the implications for astrophysical phenomena .",
    "the sonic points discussed in the previous subsection correspond to the so - called critical points in dynamical system .",
    "it is known that the innermost and outermost critical points are of the saddle - type , while the middle critical point is of the center - type .",
    "hence , the transonic accretion flows can be constructed only for the former two critical points .",
    "these two transonic flows have the same bernoulli constant and angular momentum but different entropies , and they can be connected by a standing shock wave , where the rankine - hugoniot relations hold : @xmath12 \\ , l_{\\mu } & = & 0 ,   \\label{eq : rhconti}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13 \\ , l_{\\nu } & = & 0 ,   \\label{eq : rhem}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a 4-dimensional vector normal to the shocked surface , and is set to be @xmath15 in axisymmetric steady flows ( see also eq .",
    "( [ eq : normalvectoshock ] ) for the non - axisymmetric perturbations ) .",
    "we use the notation of @xmath16 \\equiv q_{+ } - q_{-}$ ] , where the subscript @xmath17 represents a post - shock quantity and @xmath18 a pre - shock quantity .",
    "the bernoulli constant and specific angular momentum are defined respectively as @xmath19 since the bernoulli constant , specific angular momentum and mass flux are unchanged across the shock , we only need to consider the radial component of energy momentum conservation across the shock .",
    "then the rankine - hugoniot relation in axisymmetric steady flows can be written as : @xmath20 & = & 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : rhenmostaaxis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in general , there are two possible shock locations , to which we refer as the inner and outer shocks .",
    "this is apparent in the right panel of the figures  [ tefig1 ] , in which we show the parameter region that allows multiple shock locations .",
    "it is well known , however , that the inner shock is unstable against axisymmetric perturbations @xcite , which we have confirmed by our own linear analysis .",
    "we have also done numerical simulations with a single grid point in the azimuthal direction , thus suppressing non - axisymmetric modes , and observed that the inner shock is either swallowed by a black hole or moved outwards to be the outer shock after radial perturbations are imposed . on the other hand",
    ", we have seen that the outer shock is stable against radial perturbations even if the perturbation amplitude is not necessarily small . in the following",
    ", we will consider only the outer shock .",
    "we have constructed several axisymmetric steady accretion flows with an outer shock for different combinations of the adiabatic index and injection parameters , which are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "here we give the basic equations and boundary conditions for the linear analysis .",
    "the obtained eigen values are later compared with the numerical simulations , and the eigenstates are employed to impose the initial perturbations .",
    "the basic equations are the linearized relativistic continuity and energy - momentum tensor conservation equations ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : continubase ] ) and ( [ eq : energymomentum ] ) ) .",
    "we again neglect the @xmath3-component of velocity and all the @xmath3-derivatives and consider the equatorial plane only . under this assumption ,",
    "the system equations are written as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is entropy and the following notations are used : @xmath23 following the standard procedure of linear stability analysis , the perturbed quantities are assumed to be proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "all perturbed quantities are calculated from @xmath25 and @xmath26 . @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be integrated analytically as @xmath29 where the subscript r denotes the value evaluated at @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we need to integrate numerically only two eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lineconti2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ber2 ] ) .",
    "these linearized equations can be solved with appropriately setting boundary conditions , which are imposed at the shock surface and inner sonic point . in this study , we assume that the perturbations are confined in the post - shock region and the pre - shock region remains unperturbed . as a result , the outer boundary condition is set at the shock surface .",
    "we express the shock radius as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the initial amplitude of shock displacement .",
    "defined as the 4-dimensional vector normal to the shock surface , @xmath33 can be given as @xmath34 using these relations in the rankine - hugoniot relations expressed in general as @xmath35   \\ , l_{\\mu } = 0   $ ] , we can write eqs .",

    "the explicit forms of these equations are given by @xmath39 with the following definitions : @xmath40    as for the inner boundary condition , on the other hand , a regularity condition is imposed at the sonic point . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lineconti2 ] ) to ( [ eq : sigmadef ] ) , we obtain the differential equation for @xmath41 , which is written generally as @xmath42 the linearized form of this equation becomes @xmath43 where the explicit forms of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the unperturbed sound velocity in the comoving frame and the adiabatic index , respectively .",
    "since @xmath44 vanishes at the sonic point , we impose the regularity condition there : @xmath50",
    "the growth of the initial perturbations is computed with a multi - dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics code , which is based on a modern technique , the so - called high - resolution central scheme @xcite .",
    "the details of the numerical scheme are given in appendix .",
    "we use the kerr - schild coordinates with the kerr parameter being set to be zero , since they have no coordinate singularity at the event horizon and we can put the inner boundary inside the event horizon .",
    "this is very advantageous for numerical simulations .",
    "we employ a @xmath49-law  eos , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the pressure , rest - mass density , and specific internal energy , respectively .",
    "the computational domain is a part of the equatorial plane with @xmath55 and the computation times are @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the black hole mass and the unit with @xmath58 is used .",
    "we employ @xmath59 grid points .",
    "the radial grid width is non - uniform with the grid being smallest , ( @xmath60 ) , at the inner boundary and increasing geometrically by @xmath61 per zone toward the outer boundary .",
    "the initial perturbation modes are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] . for models m1",
    "to m12 we add the @xmath62 mode , where @xmath63 stands for the azimuthal mode number in @xmath64 . for models m1m2 and m1m3 , on the other hand , the @xmath65 modes are initially imposed , respectively .",
    "these models are meant for the study of the initial - mode dependence . in order to investigate the initial - amplitude dependence",
    ", we also run models m1a10 and m1a100 , whose initial amplitudes are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively",
    ". the unperturbed flows for models m1m2 , m1m3 , m1a10 and m1a100 are common to those of the other models .",
    "the radial distributions of these modes are obtained by the linear analysis .",
    "this is important to compare the linear growth of purely single modes between the linear analysis and numerical simulations , and is one of the differences from @xcite .",
    "we choose the most unstable mode for each azimuthal wave number except for m1a100 , in which the following perturbation is employed to avoid a velocity larger than the light velocity : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the unperturbed radial velocity .",
    "the initial perturbations are added to the whole post - shock region , except for model m1a100 , in which the perturbation is imposed to the region between the inner sonic point and the shock again to prevent the flow velocity from being larger than the light velocity .    in the following",
    ", we set the black hole mass to be @xmath70m@xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the solar mass .",
    "we have in mind here some applications to astrophysical phenomena such as grbs and qpos .",
    "since the formulation is dimensionless , the scaling is quite obvious .",
    "in this section , we describe the time evolutions of non - axisymmetric instability obtained by fully dynamical grhd simulations . in the following analysis",
    ", we frequently employ the mode decomposition of the shock surface by the following fourier transform : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the radius of the shock wave as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath77 and the amplitude of mode @xmath63 as a function of @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "figures  [ tefig5 ] and [ tefig6 ] show the temporal evolutions of velocity and entropy for the baseline model m1 , respectively .",
    "the perturbation grows exponentially at the beginning and the shock wave is deformed according to the imposed @xmath62 mode , for which the deformed shock surface rotates progressively , that is , in the direction of the unperturbed flows .",
    "then the shock radius , or the @xmath78 mode , starts to grow .",
    "after several revolutions , a spiral arm develops and the instability is saturated with more complex structures . in this non - linear regime , several shocks are generated and collide with each other . as a result of these interactions , the original shock oscillates radially .",
    "as given in table  [ tab : dyreso1 ] , the saturation levels of shock radius , or the @xmath78 mode , differ widely among models .",
    "for example , the left panel of figure  [ figm1modet500 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath78 mode for model m1 .",
    "both large- and small - amplitude oscillations can be seen , which correspond to the periods of @xmath79  ms and @xmath80  ms , respectively .",
    "these two kinds of axisymmetric oscillations are also found in other models .",
    "their characteristics are summarized in table  [ tab : dyreso1 ] .",
    "the growth of @xmath78 mode in the non - linear phase is strongly dependent on the mach number ( see tables  [ tab1 ]  and  [ tab : dyreso1 ] ) .",
    "i.e. , a stronger shock tends to become more unstable against non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "although there is no entry to the maximum amplitude of m=0 mode in table 2 for model m5 , this is not an exception .",
    "in fact , the shock is so unstable in this model that it leaves the computational domain soon after the addition of non - axisymmetric perturbations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillation periods of the non - axisymmetric modes are much shorter in general than those of the axisymmetric ones .",
    "indeed , the right panel of figure  [ figm1modet500 ] shows the time evolutions of @xmath81 modes for model m1 . the typical periods range from several to a few dozen milli - seconds .    in the non - linear phase ,",
    "the dominant mode is @xmath62 for almost all models .",
    "remarkably , although the initially added perturbations are not the @xmath62 mode in models m1m2 and m1m3 , the non - linear mode couplings lead eventually to the dominance of the @xmath62 mode ( see the upper panels of figure  [ figmodedepegraph ] ) .      equations ( [ eq : lineconti2 ] ) to ( [ eq : lineentro2 ] ) with the boundary conditions at the shock surface and sonic point are solved numerically to find eigen modes .",
    "figure  [ figlinem123eigen ] shows the real and imaginary parts of eigen frequencies for some of the @xmath82 modes for model m1 .",
    "they are all unstable non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "we find , on the other hand , that the axisymmetric perturbations are stable , which is consistent with both the present dynamical simulations and the previous work @xcite .",
    "the oscillation periods , which correspond to @xmath83 , are @xmath84  ms for the most unstable mode in each m - sequence for model m1 , whereas the growth times , which are obtained from @xmath85 , are @xmath86  ms .",
    "figure  [ figcomplinegrhd ] shows the comparison of the amplitudes obtained by the linear analysis and dynamical simulations .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the oscillation period and growth time are in good agreement between them for the first @xmath87  ms , which is the linear growth phase .",
    "it is also found that after @xmath87  ms , the result of the dynamical simulation starts to deviate from that of the linear analysis , which indicates the beginning of the non - linear phase .",
    "the amplitude is saturated and the oscillation period gets slightly longer .",
    "according to figure  [ figm1m0evo ] , which shows the evolution of axisymmetric @xmath78 mode , we find that it starts to grow at @xmath88  ms , leading to the increase of the average shock radius .",
    "this is the reason why the oscillation period becomes longer in the non - linear phase .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section and summarized in table  [ tab : dyreso1 ] , the dominant modes in the non - linear phase are progressive , that is , the deformation pattern rotates in the same direction as the unperturbed flow .",
    "this is also true for all the linearly unstable modes .",
    "in fact , the linear analysis shows that there is no unstable mode for @xmath89 .",
    "note that @xcite demonstrated by linear analysis for the accretion onto a neutron star that the progressive modes are enhanced and retrogressive ones are suppressed by rotation .    as the specific angular momentum of the unperturbed flow becomes larger , the distance between the shock wave and the inner sonic point gets greater ( see models m1 and m4 in table  [ tab1 ] ) . according to the linear analysis",
    ", the number of unstable modes also increases , whereas the growth time of the most unstable modes becomes longer .",
    "this suggests that the larger distance tends to stabilize the non - axisymmetric instability though it is not the only factor for the shock instability .",
    "in fact , it is also found that the growth rate of unstable modes is affected by the shock strength , that is , stronger shocks tend to be more unstable .",
    "finally we show in figure  [ fig : mostunstamodesm1case ] the most unstable modes for different @xmath63 s in model m1 .",
    "as is clear , the most unstable of all is the @xmath90 mode and the modes with @xmath91 are stable for this model .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the real part of eigen frequency for the most unstable modes becomes larger as the mode number @xmath63 is higher ( see the left panel of figure  [ fig : mostunstamodesm1case ] ) , while the pattern frequency @xmath92 becomes smaller ( the right panel of figure  [ fig : mostunstamodesm1case ] ) .      by comparing models m1 , m1a10 and m1a100",
    ", we find that the qualitative feature of dynamics are almost the same . in the linear phase",
    ", the growth of mode amplitudes is unaffected by the initial condition .",
    "only the duration of the linear phase become shorter as the initial amplitude is larger as expected .",
    "the saturation levels do not differ very much among three models .",
    "in fact , the non - linear phase is rather chaotic and forgets the difference in the initial condition .",
    "it is also important to point out that in spite of the large initial amplitude for model m1a100 , the shock continues to exist .",
    "this implies that if the injection parameters are appropriate , a standing shock will exist oscillating violently in the accretion flows into black holes .",
    "next we show what happens if we impose initially the @xmath93 or @xmath94 mode instead of the @xmath62 mode , comparing models m1 , m1m2 and m1m3 . in the upper panels of figure  [ figmodedepegraph ]",
    ", we show the time evolutions of the amplitudes for various modes in models m1m2 ( left panel ) and m1m3 ( right panel ) .",
    "we first pay attention to the evolution up to @xmath95  ms , where the difference is most evident .",
    "note that the linear phase lasts only for @xmath96  ms and the non - linear phase thereafter is the focus here . in the left panel ,",
    "we see the growth and saturation of @xmath90 mode in addition to the original @xmath93 mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath97 mode is formed to grow to the saturation in the right panel .",
    "note that the @xmath78 mode is also generated in these models and will be discussed later .",
    "these models are produced by the non - linear mode - couplings , which are of quadratic nature , and the other modes with odd @xmath63 for model m1m2 , for example , are not generated .",
    "after @xmath95  ms , however , other modes also emerge and grow to be saturated .",
    "these modes are probably generated by numerical noises , having much smaller amplitudes initially and spending longer time in the linear phase .",
    "after the saturation of the modes , the dynamics is almost identical for the three models .    in the lower panel of figure  [ figmodedepegraph ] , we show the time evolution of the amplitudes of @xmath78 mode for the three models .",
    "as mentioned above , the modes are produced by the quadratic mode couplings of the initially imposed modes .",
    "up to @xmath95  ms , the evolutions are quite different among them . for model m1",
    ", the amplitude grows to be 4 times larger than the initial value in @xmath98  ms and oscillates violently thereafter . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum amplitudes are much smaller for models m1m2 and m1m3 , and the following oscillations have much smaller amplitudes .",
    "in fact , for model m1m3 the amplitude becomes almost constant after @xmath98  ms .",
    "the saturation level is much lower than that of model m1m2 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that even though the @xmath99 mode is the unstable in the linear phase ( see figure  [ figlinem123eigen ] ) , the average shock radius , or the @xmath78 mode , is most strongly affected by the @xmath62 mode .",
    "after @xmath95  ms , all modes are saturated and the behavior of the @xmath78 mode becomes almost identical among the different models .      in this paper , we employ the simple @xmath49-law eos and so far we have discussed only the case with @xmath100 . in reality",
    "the eos will not be so simple and the adiabatic index may not be constant . in order to infer the differences that the eos may make",
    ", we vary the adiabatic index in the the @xmath49-law eos and see the changes in this subsection .",
    "it is the unperturbed accretion flows that are most affected by the change of adiabatic index .",
    "it is found that as the adiabatic index becomes larger , both the specific angular momentum and bernoulli constant that allow the existence of a standing shock wave gets smaller .",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "the structure of unperturbed accretion flows and hence the existence of shock are determined by the balance between the attractive gravity and the repulsive centrifugal force and pressure . as the eos becomes harder , the pressure gets larger and , as a result , the centrifugal force can be reduced . for the same specific angular momentum , on the other hand",
    ", the bernoulli constant can be smaller for harder eos s .",
    "note that the bernoulli constant is a measure of the matter temperature at infinity .",
    "the instability itself is also affected by the change of adiabatic index , since it depends on the structure of unperturbed accretion flows .",
    "the results are summarized in tables  [ tab : dyreso1 ] and [ tabreso1 ] .",
    "although it is difficult to find a systematic trend here , the saturation amplitude of the @xmath78 mode appears to be correlated with the mach number : as the mach number becomes larger by the change of adiabatic index , the saturation level gets enhanced .",
    "it is more important to understand here , however , that the instability does not change qualitatively in spite of the relatively large variation in the injection parameters that allow the existence of the standing shock wave .",
    "more thorough investigations of the eos dependence will be a future task .      to gain some insight into the instability mechanism , we calculate some time scales as follows : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the radius of inner sonic point and @xmath103 are the outgoing ( + ) and ingoing ( - ) sound velocities , respectively , and",

    "( [ eq : cycle_dcc ] )  to  ( [ eq : cycle_ccs ] ) for all the models .",
    "it is found that the periods of acoustic - acoustic cycle are closer to the growth times than those of the advective - acoustic cycle , which appears to support the claim by the preceding papers @xcite that the instability is of the papaloizou - pringle type .",
    "it is important , however , to point out that we can not identify the reflection point clearly ( see figure  [ cyclefreq ] , in which the left ( right ) panel adopts the corotation ( inner sonic ) point as the inner reflection point ) .",
    "this is mainly because the wavelengths of the perturbations are rather long .",
    "in fact , we estimate the wavelength of acoustic perturbation by @xmath108 which should be much smaller than the scale height of the unperturbed flows for the justification of wkb approximations . the wavelength of the dominant unstable mode for each model is given in table  [ tabreso1 ] .",
    "according to this estimation , it is comparable or longer than the scale height .",
    "hence the wkb approximation is not justified at least for these models .",
    "indeed , the reflection point of waves lose its meaning .",
    "incidentally , the wkb approximation may be applicable to higher harmonics .",
    "in fact , there are sequences of unstable modes up to m=12 for model m1 , for example , and the wavelengths of their high harmonics are found to be shorter than the scale height",
    ". it should be noted , however , that they have smaller growth rates and subdominant in driving the instability .",
    "note also that the above analysis neither approves nor disproves of a particular mechanism in a mathematically rigorous sense .",
    "we need further investigation definitely .",
    "in the previous sections , we have found that the standing shock wave in the accretion flow into the schwarzschild black hole is generally unstable to the non - axisymmetric perturbations and that it oscillates with large amplitudes in the non - linear regime .",
    "here we consider the astrophysical implications of the shock instability , picking up black hole qpos and grbs as examples .      as mentioned already ,",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations have been observed for a couple of black hole candidates and they are attributed to some activities of the accretion disk around the black hole .",
    "the shock oscillation model for black hole qpos has been investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "recently , for example , @xcite performed two - dimensional pseudo - newtonian numerical simulations of the shock oscillation in the meridian section assuming axisymmetry and taking into account the cooling and heating of gas and the radiation transport .",
    "they demonstrated that a quasi - periodically oscillating shock wave is formed around a black hole .",
    "they compared the numerical results with the observations for _ grs 1915 + 105 _ and suggested that the intermediate frequency qpo of this source might be due to the shock instability @xcite .",
    "our models are different from those of @xcite .",
    "they consider the axisymmetric oscillations whereas we investigate the non - axisymmetric oscillations .",
    "we take general relativity fully into account .",
    "besides , we calculate the energy density spectra for the present models . in so doing ,",
    "we employ the data in the non - linear regime , that is , 100  ms after the onset of computations .",
    "note that the dynamics in the non - linear phase is almost identical in all the models , including the ones , in which the @xmath93  or  @xmath94 mode is initially imposed instead of the @xmath62 mode .",
    "figure  [ modefouriermode1 ] shows the power spectra for the @xmath109 modes in model m1 .",
    "it is found that the @xmath78 mode has a quasi - periodic feature around 8  hz , which corresponds to the period of large oscillations observed for the @xmath78 mode . although there are some hints of other qpos , they are much less remarkable .",
    "this axisymmetric quasi - periodic oscillation is similar to those found by @xcite .",
    "the most important point here , however , is the fact that the quasi - periodicity of @xmath78 mode is induced by the non - axisymmetric instability through the quadratic mode coupling .",
    "similar quasi - periodic oscillations are found also in other models .",
    "their frequencies depend on the unperturbed flow and , hence , on the bernoulli constant and specific angular momentum .",
    "the quantitative comparison with observations is beyond the scope of this paper , since we have neglected radiative processes , viscosity and , among other things , we have considered only the equatorial plane .",
    "it can be mentioned , however , that the non - axisymmetric shock instability is a good candidate of the source of qpos and further investigations are certainly needed .",
    "long grbs are currently thought to be associated with massive stellar collapses and the subsequent formation of black holes .",
    "although the central engine remains a mystery , it is widely believed that a highly relativistic jet is somehow produced near the black hole and its kinetic energy is later dissipated in internal shocks at larger distances , emitting gamma rays ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in the so - called patchy shell model ,",
    "the jet actually consists of mass shells that have slightly different velocities and collide with each other , generating the internal shock waves . although the time scale of the velocity fluctuations is thought to be set by the dynamical time scale of the black hole , the exact physical processes producing the velocity variations are unknown at present .    during the collapse of massive stars giving rise to grbs",
    ", a large amount of matter will accrete on a time scale of seconds onto a proto neutron star at first and into a black hole later .",
    "if the progenitor is rotating rapidly prior to the collapse @xcite , the accreting matter will form a disk around the compact object at the center .",
    "the accretion disk is expected to be advection - dominated @xcite .",
    "we are thus interested in the stability of the accretion flows into the black hole , especially in the accretion - dominated regime . here",
    "we consider the accretion flows with a standing shock wave in them , since the core bounce produces a shock wave , which becomes an standing shock in the core soon after and will continue to exist in the subsequent accretions onto a proto neutron star , the phase just preceding the black hole formation .",
    "even if the bounce shock does not survive , there will be a lot of chances of shock formation as long as the standing shock is robust , since the velocity and pressure of accreting matter are fluctuating in reality .    according to the patchy shell model , gamma rays",
    "are emitted when the kinetic energy of ultra - relativistic jet is dissipated in internal shock waves , which are originated from the inhomogeneity of the jet .",
    "although the mechanism of jet formation remains unknown , the black hole is supposed to be involved .",
    "the source of the inhomogeneity is also an unsolved problem .",
    "if a standing shock wave exists in the accretion flow , for example , as a relic of the shock wave produced at the core bounce , we speculate that the intrinsic instability of the system against non - radial perturbations will be a natural source of fluctuations in the grbs jet if it is formed from some interactions between the accretion disk and black hole , which is not unlikely @xcite .",
    "it is mentioned incidentally that the recent progenitor models , which could produce grb @xcite , predict the injection parameters that are appropriate for the existence of a standing accretion shock .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated the evolutions of massive stars , taking into account magnetic fields and obtained the specific angular momentum of several @xmath110 @xmath111/s and the temperature @xmath112 for the matter that will later form an accretion disk .",
    "these numbers are just suitable for the existence of a standing shock wave in the accretion disk around a black hole of several m@xmath113 .",
    "owing to the non - axisymmetric instability , the mass flux fluctuates very much indeed in our models .",
    "in this context , it is interesting to mention that the quasi - periodic oscillation with a period much longer than the dynamical time scale , which we have found in the previous sections , may leave its imprint somehow in the prompt gamma ray emissions or early x - ray afterglows .",
    "it is certainly necessary , however , to study possible effects of cooling  @xcite on the instability .",
    "the disk thickness we ignored in this paper is also a concern in the future work .",
    "we finally mention that the gravitational radiation by the non - radial shock instability may also have interesting implications .",
    "we have investigated the non - axisymmetric shock instability in the accretion disk around schwarzschild black holes , employing the fully general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations as well as the linear analysis .",
    "both the linear and non - linear phases have been analyzed in detail .",
    "we have also given some possible implications for astrophysically interesting phenomena such as black hole qpos and grbs .",
    "the main findings in the present work are as follows :    \\(a ) the standing shock is generally unstable against non - axisymmetric perturbations , and a spiral arm structure is formed as a result of the growth of instability .",
    "it is typically one - armed , implying that the dominant mode in the non - linear phase is the @xmath62 mode .",
    "\\(b ) in the linear phase , the dynamical simulations are in good agreement with the linear analysis in such features as stability , oscillation and growth time scales . the progressive modes , in which the deformed shock pattern rotates in the same direction as the unperturbed flow , are unstable and the retrogressive modes are stable .",
    "this is consistent with the previous works .",
    "\\(c ) in the non - linear phase , various modes are produced by non - linear couplings , which are mainly of quadratic nature , and the amplitudes are saturated . the axisymmetric mode is also induced by the non - axisymmetric instability , and the shock radius oscillates with large amplitudes .",
    "the oscillation periods become slightly longer than in the linear analysis because of larger shock radii .",
    "\\(d ) even though strong perturbations are added initially , the shock remains to exist .",
    "hence the disk plus shock system is quite robust in this sense .",
    "\\(e ) the comparison of various cycle time scales with the linear growth times seems to support the claim that the instability is induced by the acoustic - acoustic cycle , although the inner reflection point is not identified unambiguously .",
    "it is important to note in this respect that the wavelength of perturbations is longer than the scale height , which does not allow the wkb approximation .",
    "\\(f ) the black hole sasi found by @xcite may be a promising candidate for the sources of the black hole qpos and fluctuations in grb jets .    in the present study",
    ", we have also found that the non - axisymmetric instability is sensitive to the structure of the unperturbed steady flow .",
    "the general relativity is important in this respect .",
    "it should be stressed that the injection parameters that allow the existence of a standing shock wave are different between the gr and pseudo - newtonian treatments .",
    "in fact , we have found by the direct comparison that the maximum specific angular momentum for the existence of multiple sonic points is different by more than 60% for the bernoulli constant @xmath114 .",
    "note also that the general relativity is indispensable in discussing the accretion into a kerr black hole , since the frame - dragging will play an important role .",
    "this is currently undertaken @xcite . for more detailed comparison with observations ,",
    "it is necessary to include the cooling and heating for grbs case , and the magnetic field and viscosity for black hole qpos .",
    "last but not least , the discussed simulations including the polar dimension are inevitable .",
    "we are grateful to kenta kiuchi and yu yamamoto for useful discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by the grant - in - aid for the 21st century coe program `` holistic research and education center for physics of self - organizing systems '' of waseda university and for scientific research of the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan ( 17540267 , 14079202 ) .",
    "here we describe the grhd code that are used in this paper . as mentioned already , it is base on the so - called central scheme , which guarantees a good accuracy even if flows include strong shocks and/or high lorentz factors .",
    "magnetic fields can be also included @xcite .",
    "though we do not take into account the evolution of gravitational field , the so - called 3 + 1 formalism is suitable for hydrodynamics as well .",
    "following  @xcite , we write the metric in the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 are the lapse , shift vector , and spatial metric , respectively .",
    "the basic equations for fluid dynamics in 3 + 1 form are expressed as : @xmath119 where various variables are defined as follows : @xmath120 in the above equations , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the determinant of the three metric and extrinsic curvature , respectively .",
    "we refer to @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 as `` conserved variables ( collectively denoted by @xmath126 ) '' , whereas @xmath53 , @xmath52 and @xmath127 are called `` primitive variables ( collectively expressed as @xmath128 ) '' .",
    "the conserved variables can be calculated directly from the primitive variables via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : con1def ] ) ,  ( [ eq : con2def ] )  and  ( [ eq : con3def ] ) .",
    "there is no analytical expression for the primitive variables as a function of the conserved variables , on the other hand .",
    "since we update the conserved variables rather than the primitive variables , we must need to solve the latter numerically at each time step because they are necessary for the calculations of the characteristic wave speed at each cell interface as shown later .",
    "if we use a @xmath49-law eos , the inversion can be conducted easily as done by  @xcite .",
    "the same method can not be applicable to the general eos , however .",
    "hence we take a different procedure based on the newton - raphson method , which will be explained below .",
    "we first write down a useful relation between @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 we define two more quantities as @xmath132 we then search iteratively for the primitive variables that satisfy @xmath133 .",
    "we first guess two thermodynamical quantities @xmath53 and @xmath52",
    ". then other thermodynamical quantities can be obtained from the eos .",
    "next , we obtain @xmath130 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : con2def ] ) using @xmath124 , @xmath123 and @xmath134 , @xmath129 is determined by @xmath130 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : utujrela ] ) .",
    "thus the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : deff1 ] )  and  ( [ eq : deff2 ] ) are expressed as a function of only two thermodynamical quantities .",
    "we solve them by the newton - raphson method .",
    "the initial guess is obtained from the values at the previous step .",
    "the net flux at the cell interface is given by the approximate solution to the riemann problem .",
    "our code adopts the hll ( harten .",
    "lax , and van leer ) flux , which does not require the complete knowledge of the solutions to the riemann problem but the maximum wave speed in each direction is needed .",
    "the first step for calculating the flux is to obtain @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which are the values of primitive variables interpolated to the right- and left - hand side of each cell interface .",
    "we have implemented the muscl method @xcite for this purpose . from @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the maximum wave speed on each side of the cell interface , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , can be calculated as in  @xcite .",
    "the hll flux is then expressed with the maximum wave speeds defined by @xmath139 and @xmath140 as @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the fluxes calculated with @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "note that if we define @xmath144 , then @xmath145 becomes the local lax - friedrichs flux .",

    "<S> we study the stability of standing shock waves in advection - dominated accretion flows into a schwarzschild black hole by 2d general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations as well as linear analysis in the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the accretion shock is stable against axisymmetric perturbations but becomes unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the results of dynamical simulations show good agreement with linear analysis on the stability , oscillation and growing time scales . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of different wave - travel times with the growth time scales of the instability suggests that the instability is likely to be of the papaloizou - pringle type , induced by the repeated propagations of acoustic waves . </S>",
    "<S> however , the wavelengths of perturbations are too long to clearly define the reflection point . by analyzing the non - linear phase in the dynamical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that quadratic mode couplings precede the non - linear saturation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that not only short - term random fluctuations by turbulent motions but also quasi periodic oscillations take place on longer time scales in the non - linear phase . </S>",
    "<S> we give some possible implications of the instability for quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and the central engine for gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) . </S>"
