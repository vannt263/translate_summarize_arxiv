    "most of the single particle properties of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in dilute weakly interacting gases are well described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the gpe is well suited for investigating static as well as dynamic properties of a bec and also allows to investigate the stability of becs with attractive interactions in a trapping potential .",
    "inelastic processes which only become important for large particle densities are usually accounted for by adding cubic and quintic damping terms to the gpe which are believed to properly describe two- and three - particle loss , respectively .    in early experiments on bec with attractive interactions",
    "@xcite the scattering length was fixed and limited the size of these condensates to a number @xmath0 @xcite which for typical experimental parameters was on the order of @xmath1 . in these experiments a collapse of the condensate was induced stochastically while growing the bec out of a thermal cloud of atoms .",
    "in contrast , more recent experiments by donley _ et al . _ @xcite allowed to deterministically induce collapses of the condensate which revealed a dramatic behavior for a @xmath2rb bec . in these experiments the sign of the scattering length is changed from positive ( repulsive interaction ) to negative ( attractive interaction ) values by an external magnetic field . this sudden change in the sign of the interaction leads to a series of collapses and explosions , a dynamical behavior which provides a very good opportunity for testing the applicability of the gpe .",
    "in particular the nature of the atoms emitted in a burst during the collapse of the condensate is not very well understood at present @xcite .",
    "while some numerical studies @xcite indicate that these atoms are produced coherently and can be described by the gpe , other numerical @xcite and analytical approaches @xcite conclude that these atoms are not described by the gpe alone .",
    "the numerical studies arrive at different conclusions mostly due to the choice of the three particle loss rate near the feshbach resonance .",
    "the work of saito and ueda @xcite predicts a series of collapses and explosions during the experiment and correctly reproduces the burst atoms by choosing a three particle loss rate that is smaller than the one used by adhikari @xcite where one big collapse determines most of the behavior of the condensate and the burst atoms are not reproduced correctly .",

    "are suggested to cause the bursts and in @xcite the dynamics of collective excitations driven by the collapsing condensate are investigated analytically and found to explain the overall features of collapsing and exploding condensates .",
    "the effect of a molecular state close to threshold near a feshbach resonance on the interaction between the atoms is explored in @xcite .",
    "in fact , such novel interaction mechanisms arising close to feshbach resonances which are not contained in the gpe could yield the relatively large burst energies seen in the experiment @xcite .",

    "we first choose the three - body loss rate @xmath3 to match the observed remnant condensate particle numbers and collapse times .",

    "the merit of the tssp for solving the gpe is that it is explicit , unconditionally stable , time reversible and time transverse invariant when the gpe is , of spectral order accuracy in space and of second order accuracy in time , conserves the total number of particles for the gpe ( [ sdge ] ) without damping , i.e.  for @xmath30 , and exactly reproduces the decay rate of the total number of particles for the gpe ( [ sdge ] ) with a linear damping term , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "it is well known that the three - dimensional cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) ( i.e. gpe without external potential ) with sufficiently large attractive two - body interaction leads to finite - time collapse of the spatial condensate density @xcite , i.e. @xmath83 becomes a delta distribution for some finite value of time , and afterwards the solution ceases to exist .",
    "this collapse mechanism is halted by the three - body recombination term , which starts to kick in when the density becomes too large locally and then acts to instantaneously reduce the density in an explosion - like process @xcite .",
