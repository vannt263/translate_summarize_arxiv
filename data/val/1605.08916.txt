    "there has been a long history of studies on the @xmath0 radioactivity which was first described by ernest rutherford in 1899 .",
    "the structure of the particle was identified by 1907 as @xmath1he ( he@xmath2 ion ) with two protons and two neutrons , which , with the binding energy 7.1 mev per nucleon , is the most stable configuration below @xmath3c .",
    "the greatest challenge then was to understand how the @xmath0 particle could leave the less stable mother nucleus without any external disturbance .",
    "the decay process was successfully interpreted by gamow @xcite and gurney and condon @xcite as a quantum tunneling effect , which required to accept the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics . the extent to which this was revolutionary",
    "can perhaps best be gauged by noticing the multitude of models that have been put forward as an alternative to the probabilistic interpretation . besides its pioneering role in nuclear physics and in the development of quantum theory , the tunneling effect is also realized to be responsible for the thermonuclear reactions and stellar evolution .",
    "processes like nuclear fusion , proton and @xmath0 captures can also be explained as an inverse tunneling @xcite .",
    "the tunneling was accepted as a general physical phenomenon around mid-20th century and also becomes relevant at the nanoscale with important applications such as the tunnel diode , scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum computing as well as chemical and biological evolutions . without tunneling",
    "there would be no star , no life , let alone nuclear physics or quantum mechanics .",
    "@xmath0 decay has been among the most important decay modes of atomic nuclei for more than a century .",
    "the decay occurs most often in massive nuclei that have large proton to neutron ratios , where it can reduce the ratio of protons to neutrons in the parent nucleus , bringing it to a more stable configuration in the daughter nucleus .",
    "almost all observed proton - rich or neutron - deficient nuclei starting from mass number @xmath4 have @xmath0 radioactivities , as shown in fig .",
    "various phenomenological and microscopic models have been developed to study the @xmath0-decay process , which can successfully reproduce available experimental @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "the spontaneous emission of charged fragments heavier than the @xmath0 particle is known as cluster radioactivity .",
    "this process is more closely related to spontaneous fission , i.e. , a disintegration of the heavy nucleus into two lighter ones @xcite . for available superheavy elements or superheavy nuclei @xcite , fission and @xmath0 decay are the dominant decay modes .",
    "the detection of emitted @xmath0 particles has been the principal method of identifying superheavy nuclei as well as their excited states @xcite , which can be created in heavy ion fusion reactions .",
    "nuclear physics is undergoing a renaissance with the availability of intense radioactive beams .",
    "the new facilities have opened up new possibilities to investigate highly unstable nuclei as well as to probe existing formalisms trying to describe those nuclei .",
    "recent investments in new or upgraded facilities such as fair at gsi , darmstadt , hie - isolde at cern , geneva , spiral2 at ganil , caen , frib at msu and ribf at riken , in conjunction with new detector systems , in particular @xmath5 ray tracking devices like agata , will produce unprecedented data on exotic nuclei and nuclear matter in the decades to come . in this review",
    "we would like to discuss the recent developments and new opportunities in the study of the decay of heavy nuclei and our understanding of the so - called nuclear @xmath0 formation probabilities and the underlying structure of the nuclei involved .",
    "we will concentrate in particular on the progress that has been made during the past decade and the current status of experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "extensive reviews on the @xmath0 clustering in light nuclei , which is a closely related topic , could be found , e.g. , in refs .",

    "the gamow theory explained nicely the @xmath0 decay as the penetration ( tunneling ) through the coulomb barrier . although successful",
    ", one can assert that this is an effective theory , where one has to assume a preformed @xmath0 particle inside the nucleus and concepts like  frequency of escape attempts \" have to be introduced .",
    "this semiclassical picture collides with basic quantum mechanics , since even if the @xmath0 particle existed in the mother nucleus , the pauli principle would hinder any free motion of the particle inside the nucleus .",
    "actually it has been realized in the early study of nuclear structure that the nucleus can not be composed of @xmath0 particles @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 configuration is usually a very small component of the nuclear wave function .",
    "what is missing in gamow s picture is the probability that the @xmath0 particle is formed at a certain distance around the nuclear surface .",
    "a proper calculation of the decay process needs to address first the formation of the @xmath0 particle around the nuclear surface and , in a second step , the evaluation of the penetrability ( the probability of tunneling ) through the static coulomb and centrifugal barriers at the region where the @xmath0 particle was already formed .",
    "it is expected that the decays of the proton and other charged clusters heavier than @xmath0 can be described by the same mechanism .",
    "we understand now that the structure of the nucleus is best described by the nuclear shell model where its building blocks , neutrons and protons , are held together by an average potential ( the so - called nuclear mean field ) generated by nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "the shell structure indicates that nucleons need to fill successively single - particle orbitals separated by the magic numbers .",
    "the traditional ones are 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 , and 126 .",
    "the neutrons and protons are expected to distribute homogeneously if no two - body correlation is considered .",
    "however , they do correlate with each other through the residual interaction ( in the sense that the mean field part is subtracted from the nucleon - nucleon interaction ) .",
    "the correlation may induce clusterization ( i.e. , large spatial overlap ) of the four nucleons which may eventually become the @xmath0-particle .",
    "a proper description of @xmath0 clusterization in terms of its components requires the treatment of the residual correlation in a microscopic many - body framework that is a challenging undertaking .",
    "moreover , the nuclear shell structure may evolve as a function of isospin ( or neutron / proton ratio ) , leading to different particle correlation properties .",
    "one of the main aims of modern nuclear structure studies is to address on the same footing the underlying nature of atomic nucleus and the limit to its existence .",
    "it is also hoped that one can describe simultaneously dynamical processes including nuclear decay , reaction and fission . the so - called _ ab initio _ approaches ( in the sense that the full realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction is used ) have been developed in recent years and are able to describe light nuclei with @xmath6 with the help of supercomputing facilities . because of the enormous configuration spaces involved , the properties of intermediate - mass nuclei are best described by the nuclear configuration interaction approach ( the modern shell model ) where one considers only the residual correlation between particles around the surface .",
    "the superfluid nuclear density functional theory ( e.g. , the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov method ) provides a convenient tool to study the ground states and low - lying quasiparticle states of heavy nuclei throughout the nuclear chart .",
    "the main ingredient of such approach is an effective density - dependent two - body interaction that generates the nuclear mean field on top of which the pairing correlation is added .",
    "a variety of theoretical models were proposed for the explanation of the @xmath0 decay phenomenon  @xcite ( see , also , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on early efforts ) . here",
    "we very briefly go through the microscopic @xmath7-matrix description of the @xmath0 decay @xcite for which details may be found in recent publications @xcite .",
    "in general , the @xmath0-decay half - life can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the velocity of the emitted @xmath0 particle with angular momentum @xmath10 which is equal to zero for ground - state to ground - state @xmath0 decays of even - even nuclei .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is the formation amplitude of the @xmath0 cluster at distance @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 is usually chosen at a distance around the nuclear surface where the internal wave function @xmath11 is matched with the wave function of the outgoing @xmath0 particle .",
    "@xmath12 is the coulomb - hankel function with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the reduced mass and @xmath16 is the charge number of the daughter nucleus .",
    "the penetrability is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "its great importance in radioactive decay studies lies in the fact that within a given decay the penetrability process is overwhelmingly dominant .",
    "the amplitude of the wave function inside the nucleus is defined as @xmath18^*_{j_mm_m } \\psi_m(\\xi_d,\\xi_{\\alpha},\\mathbf{r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 label the daughter , emitting @xmath0 and mother nuclei , respectively , and @xmath22 denote the coordinates of the nucleons involved . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the wave functions of the mother and daughter nuclei .",
    "@xmath25 is a gaussian function of the relative coordinates of the nucleons that constitute the @xmath0 particle .",
    "we take @xmath26po as a simple example .",
    "the nucleus can be described as a four - particle state ( @xmath27 ) outside the doubly magic @xmath28pb ( with frozen degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the wave function can be written within the shell model framework as @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) labels two - neutron ( two - proton ) states .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath31 are influenced by the neutron - proton ( np ) interaction .",
    "if this interaction was neglected , only one configuration would appear in eq .",
    "( [ msmwf ] ) .",
    "this is in cases where the correlated four - particle state is assumed to be provided by collective vibrational states . as a result , calculations can be performed by assuming @xmath32 as a double pairing vibration above the @xmath28pb inert core , i.e. , @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are the neutron ( proton ) coordinates and @xmath36 is the center of mass of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic wave function of the @xmath0 particle can be approximated by a @xmath37 function , an even simpler expression exists for the @xmath0 formation amplitude , which reads , @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 fm is the root mean square radius of the @xmath0 particle and we take @xmath41 .",
    "this approximation works well outside the nuclear surface .    in the first applications of the shell model to the description of the mother nucleus of @xmath0 decay",
    "only one configuration was used .",
    "the results were discouraging since the theoretical decay rates were smaller than the corresponding experimental values by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude @xcite , depending on the value to be chosen for the nuclear radius .",
    "however , since the matching radius @xmath7 has to be chosen at a distance beyond the point where the cluster was formed , i. e. beyond the range of the nuclear force and pauli exchanges , the formation amplitude had to be or should have been evaluated at rather large distances .",
    "but that would have required shell model calculations with large bases for the mother and daughter nuclei . with the very limited shell - model spaces used at that time",
    ", the region of prominent four - particle correlation was not reached .",
    "the fundamental role of configuration mixing was confirmed by actual large - scale calculations @xcite .",
    "this surface @xmath0-clustering effect produces a tremendous enhancement of the @xmath0-decay widths in both @xmath26po @xcite and light nuclei @xcite . with the expression for the formation amplitude shown above",
    ", the experimental half - life can now be reproduced rather well if a large number of high - lying configurations is included @xcite .",
    "recent calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite are done within the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) representation by using a surface delta interaction and nine major ho shells .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath0 formation amplitude involves the evaluation of the overlap between the corresponding proton and neutron radial functions in the laboratory framework with the @xmath0-particle intrinsic wave function as defined in the center of mass framework ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the transformation can be relatively easily handled if the radial wave functions are defined within the harmonic oscillator basis due to its intrinsic simplicity .",
    "this is also the reason why the harmonic oscillator representation is used in most _ ab initio _ and shell - model configuration interaction calculations .",
    "more realistic calculations are done based on woods - saxon and nilsson single - particle states .",
    "a single particle basis consisting of two different harmonic oscillator representations was introduced in ref .",
    "an additional attractive pocket potential of a gaussian form was introduced on top of the woods - saxon potential in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to correct the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0 formation amplitude .",
    "the mixture of shell model and cluster wave functions was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and was applied to describe the decay of the ground state of @xmath26po .",
    "the calculated formation probability that can reproduce experimental decay half - life is found to be 0.025 .",
    "significant progress has also been made in the development of nuclear density functional approaches which are now able to provide a reasonable description of ground state binding energies and densities throughout the nuclear chart , even though the description of the single - particle spectroscopy is still less satisfactory .",
    "the skyrme - hartree - fock single - particle wave functions were applied to calculate the @xmath0 formation amplitudes in both even - even nuclei @xcite and even - odd nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , the calculated formation amplitude is still several of orders of magnitude too small in comparison to experimental data .",
    "the application of the recently refined functional seems to make the discrepancy even worse @xcite .",
    "further investigation along this line would be interesting to understand the origin of the discrepancy , which may shed additional light on the constraint of the density functional .",
    "time - dependent hartree - fock calculations for @xmath0 decay and @xmath0 capture were carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite with a simplified skyrme plus yukawa potential .",
    "no spin - orbital field was considered .",
    "a full microscopic description of the clustering on the nuclear surface requires the use of realistic finite single - particle potentials including their continuum states , which is still a challenging open problem .",
    "the continuum is expected to be important since the decay involves states at the nuclear surface and high - lying states beyond that .",
    "the influence of the single - particle resonances on @xmath0 clustering was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs . @xcite the complex - energy shell model was applied to describe the @xmath0 decay of @xmath26po and @xmath42te by using a simple separable interaction .",
    "the single - particle space is again expanded in a woods - saxon basis that consists of bound and unbound resonant states .",
    "the calculations for @xmath42te did not fully converge in that work , which is probably due to the fact that the valence proton shells that lie in the continuum were not considered in the model space .",
    "( [ life ] ) is valid for the decays of spherical as well as deformed nuclei  @xcite .",
    "if the coulomb barrier of a deformed nucleus is also deformed ( or with anisotropic barrier width or height ) , the tunneling of the @xmath0 particle may become direction dependent .",
    "the tunneling through a deformed coulomb barrier was first described within the wkb approximation by bohr , frman , and mottelson , who introduced the so - called frman matrix .",
    "the method was applied in later calculations on @xmath0 decay @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of emitted @xmath0 particles from deformed nuclei were measured in refs .",
    "@xcite , which indeed revealed preferential @xmath0 emission along the symmetry axis .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the anisotropy can be a combined effect of nuclear deformation and structure @xcite .",
    "semi - classical approaches were also proposed to treat the nuclear deformation in a macroscopic way @xcite .",
    "this was also used recently in refs .",
    "coupled - channel calculations were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and compared with that from the averaged wkb approach .",
    "the mechanism for nuclear pairing is similar to that behind electronic superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the nuclear pairing correlation is related to the presence of strongly attractive two - body pairing interaction with angular momentum @xmath43 .",
    "it is the most crucial correlation beyond the nuclear mean field and leads to zero angular momentum ( e.g. , with all particles paired to @xmath43 ) for the ground states of all observed even - even nuclei .",
    "it is also responsible for the occurrence of systematic staggerings , depending on the evenness and oddness of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in many nuclear phenomena including the nuclear binding energy .",
    "the pairing correlation is relatively less favored in nuclei with odd numbers of protons and/or neutrons in relation to the fact that the odd neutron and/or proton do not participate the pairing correlation .",
    "the pairing wave function can be described well by the barden - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approach .",
    "more sophisticated models have also been developed in recent years .",
    "the pairing correlation manifests itself through the coherent contribution of a large number of shell - model configurations .",
    "this feature is also responsible for the two - particle clustering , which is manifested in a strong increase in the form factor of the two - particle transfer cross section in transfer reactions between collective pairing states .",
    "this also gives rise to giant pairing resonances , which correspond to the most collective of the pairing states lying high in the spectrum .",
    "soon after the pairing interaction had been adapted to nuclei , it was applied to the study of @xmath0 decay @xcite .",

    ", one can deduce a global trend .",
    "below the shell closure , @xmath48 decreases as a function of rising neutron number , reaching its lowest values at the shell closure . when the shell closure is crossed , a sudden increase in @xmath48 is observed .",

    "the @xmath0-particle formation amplitudes for nuclei @xmath51w , @xmath51hf @xcite and @xmath52at @xcite are systematically larger than those of neighboring nuclei , which is not understood and needs further investigation .    within the bcs approach the two - particle formation amplitude is proportional to @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the standard occupation numbers . to this one has to add the overlaps of the corresponding proton and neutron radial functions with the @xmath0-particle wave function on the nuclear surface , which do not differ strongly from each other for neighboring nuclei .",
    "the bcs pairing gap is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the pairing strength .",
    "it indicates that the @xmath0 formation amplitude is proportional to the product of the proton and the neutron pairing gaps which can serve as a signature of the change in clusterization as a function of the nucleon numbers . to probe this conjecture",
    "one may compare the formation probabilities extracted from the experimental half - lives to the corresponding pairing gaps .",
    "the latter can readily be obtained from the experimental binding energies as @xcite @xmath58.\\ ] ] the empirical pairing gaps are shown as a function of the neutron number in fig .",
    "one indeed sees a striking similarity between the tendency of the pairing gaps in this figure with the @xmath0-particle formation probabilities .",
    "this similarity makes it possible to draw conclusions on the tendencies of the formation probabilities .",

    "the possible influence of the @xmath65 shell closure on the @xmath0 formation probability and the robustness of the shell was also discussed in ref .",

    "a generic form for the @xmath0-particle formation probability was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite : when the nucleons are filling a new major closed shell , the @xmath0-particle formation amplitude is nearly constant as high-@xmath61 orbitals are filled first .",
    "as soon as the low-@xmath61 orbitals are filled , the formation probability smoothly reduces until one reaches again a closed proton or neutron configuration . crossing the closed shell induces a steep increase and the approximately constant trend mentioned above continues .",
    "however , when strong particle - hole excitations across closed shells are encountered , this generic form of the @xmath0-particle formation probability is altered as one clearly sees in the light polonium isotopes .",
    "the @xmath0 decays from ground states to excited states ( fine structure ) as well as the decays from excited states are usually less favored than ground - state to ground - state decays .",

    "when the dependence of @xmath101 on the neutron number is not linear or constant , the geiger - nuttall law is broken .",

    "as a result , the geiger - nuttall law is broken in the light polonium isotopes .",
    "this violation is induced by the strong suppression of the @xmath0 formation probability due to the fact that the deformations ( or shell - model configurations ) of the ground states of the lightest @xmath0-decaying neutron - deficient polonium isotopes ( @xmath104 ) are very different from those of the daughter lead isotopes .",

    "the region to the left in fig .",
    "[ fvsrho ] , i.e. for lighter isotopes , corresponds to the decays of well deformed nuclei where the formation probabilities decreases for these nuclei as @xmath138 increases .",
    "then , suddenly , a strong transition occurs for the nucleus @xmath141tm at @xmath138=20.5 . here",
    "the formation probability acquires its maximum value , where the experimental uncertainty regarding the half - life ( from where the formation probability is extracted ) is still quite large , and then decreases again as @xmath138 increases .",
    "the reason of the tendency of the formation probability in the figure is related to the influence of the deformation : in the left region of fig .",
    "[ fvsrho ] , the decays of the deformed nuclei proceed through small spherical components of the corresponding deformed orbitals and , therefore , the formation probabilities are small . the right region of fig .",
    "[ fvsrho ] involves the decays of spherical orbits as well as major spherical components of deformed orbitals ( for example , the @xmath134 component of the nilsson orbital @xmath142 $ ] ) which give large proton formation amplitudes .",
    "another important question is whether the formation probability is affected by the proton decay @xmath143 value .",
    "this is not expected since , as shown schematically in ref .",
    "@xcite , the formation amplitude at the nuclear surface is not sensitive to changes in the single - particle energy .",
    "neither the bcs amplitudes @xmath54 are much affected by the changing of the energy and the potential depth . on the other hand",
    ", the formation amplitude can indeed be sensitive to the nuclear deformation .",
    "but this should not be mixed up with the influence of the deformation on the binding energies and the @xmath143 value .",
    "the systematic behavior of @xmath143 values is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite which provides good information for estimating @xmath143 values for as yet unknown proton and @xmath0 decays and for the possibility for them to be observed using current experimental methods .",

    "@xcite .",
    "there have been extensive efforts measuring the rotational bands of proton emitters including @xmath152ho and the tri - axially deformed nucleus @xmath153tm @xcite .",

    "the nucleus was suggested to be of moderate oblate deformation .",
    "a multiparticle spin - trap @xmath158 isomer was discovered in @xmath159ta in ref .",
    "the state is unbound to proton decay but shows remarkable stability .",
    "structure calculations have been carried out for those nuclei . in ref .",
    "@xcite the rotational band in @xmath152ho is described using the projected shell model by taking deformed nilsson quasi - particle orbitals as bases .",
    "the @xmath153tm is well described as the coupling of of deformed rotational core and the odd proton within the particle - rotor framework in ref .",
    "the np correlation was neglected in our calculations for heavy nuclei @xcite where the two - body clustering is induced by the neutron - neutron ( nn ) and proton - proton ( pp ) pair correlations .",
    "this is reasonable since the low - lying neutron and proton single - particle states are very different from each other in those cases and the np correlation is expected to be weak .",
    "the @xmath0 formation amplitude may increase as a result of enhanced isovector ( with isospin quantum number @xmath161 ) nn , pp and np pairing and isoscalar ( with @xmath162 ) np correlation in nuclei with @xmath160 where protons and neutrons occupy the same shells and np correlation is expected to be strong .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 decays from @xmath160 nuclei can provide an ideal test ground for our understanding of the np correlation for which there is still no conclusive evidence after long and extensive studies ( see , recent discussions in refs .",

    "the @xmath0 decays of @xmath164ba @xcite and light xe and te @xcite isotopes have also been observed .",
    "the decays of @xmath165ba as well as @xmath128xe and @xmath42te may soon be reachable .",

    "[ fvsrp ] we compare the @xmath0 formation probabilities of nuclei just above @xmath74sn .",
    "the @xmath0 formation probabilities of those nuclei follows the general average mass - dependence trend of @xmath0 formation probability systematics but shows a rather large fluctuations and uncertainties .",
    "it is still difficult to determine whether there is indeed an extra enhancement in those transitions .",
    "further experimental investigation is essential in clarifying the issue",
    ". it may be useful to mention here that the systematics of formation probabilities for available @xmath0 decays shows an increasing trend as the mass number decreases .",
    "this is related to the fact that the size of the nucleus also gets smaller , which favors the formation of @xmath0 particles on the surface .",
    "the influence of np correlation upon the formation of @xmath0 particles in nuclei @xmath168ra and @xmath169xe was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the framework of a generalized bcs approach in an axially deformed woods - saxon potential",
    ". only diagonal terms between proton and neutron orbitals with the same angular - momentum projections were considered and a modest enhancement of the clustering was found in @xmath169xe .",
    "we have evaluated within the shell - model approach the nn and pp two - body clustering in @xmath170sn and @xmath170te and then evaluated the correlation angle between the two pair by switching on and off the np correlation @xcite .",
    "if the np correlation is switched on , in particular if a large number of levels is included , there is significant enhancement of the four - body clustering at zero angle .",
    "this is eventually proportional to the @xmath0 formation probability .",
    "it should be mentioned that , one needs large number of orbitals already in heavy nuclei in order to reproduce properly the @xmath0 clustering at the surface .",
    "the inclusion of np correlation will make the problem even more challenging due to the huge dimension .",
    "understanding how nuclear many - body systems can self - organize in simple and regular patterns is a long - standing challenge in modern physics . the first case where this",
    "was realized concerns the geiger - nuttall law in @xmath0 radioactivity which shows striking linear correlations between the logarithm of the decay half - life and the energy of the outgoing particle .",
    "we discussed in this review the formation of @xmath0 particle in nuclei from the clusterization of the two protons and two neutrons through the mixture of high - lying empty single particle configurations , which is induced by the strong pairing correlation .",
    "we understand that the reason for the success of the geiger - nuttall law is that the @xmath0-particle formation probability usually varies smoothly from nucleus to nucleus .",
    "systematics of the @xmath0 formation probabilities reveal interesting local fluctuations which can provide invaluable information on the pairing correlation and shell structure .",
    "the reduction of the pairing at @xmath65 and @xmath50 and the changes in the nuclear shapes in neutron - deficient nuclei around @xmath65 induce suppression of the nuclear @xmath0 clusterization on the surface .",
    "the proton decay can also be an excellent probe for our understanding of the intrinsic structure of the deformed single- ( or quasi- ) particle orbital",
    ".    it will be possible to extend the experimental knowledge on both proton decay and @xmath0 decay towards more neutron deficient nuclei around @xmath65 and 50 with the new or upgraded radioactive beam facilities .",
    "this will allow us to validate the generic description of the @xmath0 formation probabilities of @xmath160 nuclei above @xmath74sn where the influence the np correlation is expected to be the strongest since the protons and neutrons are filling the same single particle orbitals .",
    "it may also shed light on our understanding of np pairing correlation .",
    "more realistic description of the @xmath0 formation probability in heavy nuclei by using globally optimized density functional and large - scale configuration interaction method may be expected in the near future .",
    "a full microscopic description relies also on a realistic choice of the single - particle wave function including the scattering to continuum .",
    "consequently , more reliable predictions of the @xmath0 decay half lives will be achieved in unknown nuclei and in low @xmath0-decay branching ratios in nuclei close to stability .",
