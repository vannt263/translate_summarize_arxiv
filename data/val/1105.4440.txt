    "this paper is part of the bocce ( bologna open cluster chemical evolution ) project , described in detail by @xcite and aimed at deriving precise and homogeneous ages , distances , reddenings , and chemical abundances for a large sample of open clusters ( ocs ) .",
    "our final goal is to study the disc of our galaxy and its formation and evolution .",
    "in fact ocs are among the best tracers of the disc properties ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have already published results based on photometry for 23 ocs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , concentrating on the old ones , the most important to study the early epochs of the galactic disc . with the three ocs presented here",
    "we have a sample of 20 clusters with ages older than 1 gyr , i.e. about 10 per cent of all known old clusters ( see the catalogue by @xcite and its web updates ) .",
    "the three clusters examined in this paper are berkeley  23 ( @xmath0 ) , berkeley  31 ( @xmath1 ) , and king  8 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "they are old , distant clusters in the anti - centre direction .",
    "they were selected because they should all lie beyond a galactocentric distance of 12 kpc and could then be useful to understand the nature and properties of the outer galactic disc .",
    "in particular , they are located in the region where the radial metallicity distribution seems to change its slope ( e.g. , @xcite ; see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "these three clusters have already been studied to different degrees in the past , but with contrasting results .",
    "we present here high quality photometric data , to improve on the previous determinations of their parameters . as done for all our past work we use comparison of observational cmds to synthetic ones generated using different sets of evolutionary tracks .",
    "berkeley  23 has been the subject of two photometric works .",
    "@xcite observed it with a 1.8 m telescope in @xmath3 as part of a study of 12 ocs , deriving a reddening @xmath4 ( from the two - colour diagram ) , a distance modulus @xmath5 , a metallicity [ fe / h]=+0.07 , and an age of 0.79 gyr .",
    "however , the isochrone they chose does not seem to reproduce the red clump .",
    "@xcite observed 14 ocs with a 65 cm telescope , obtained @xmath6 photometry and derived the clusters parameters using isochrones .",
    "their results for be  23 differ from the previous ones : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , metallicity z=0.004 ( equivalent to [ fe / h]@xmath9 ) , and age 1.8 gyr .",
    "@xcite , who presented a catalogue of blue straggler stars in ocs ( they have about 1900 candidate bss in about 430 clusters ) , find that be  23 is rich in this kind of stars .",
    "berkeley  31 is the best studied of the three ocs .",
    "@xcite published @xmath3 photometry obtained at the 1 m usno telescope .",
    "he determined the reddening and the metallicity using the two - colour diagram , and the distance and age with isochrone fit , deriving @xmath10 , @xmath11 , [ fe / h]@xmath12 , and age 8 gyr .",
    "this old age is probably an artifact of the outdated stellar models .",
    "furthermore , the isochrones shown do not reach the red clump , while the difference in magnitude between it and the main sequence ( ms ) turn - off ( to ) is a powerful age indicator ( for different definitions of this @xmath13 see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath14 photometry , but could not derive directly @xmath13 ; the value they give would put be  31 at the same age of m67 .",
    "@xcite , who call it biurakan  7 , derive from isochrone fit @xmath15 , @xmath16 , z=0.008 , and age of 2.2 gyr .",
    "the discording results are not limited to the photometry .",
    "@xcite , using low resolution spectra of 24 stars ( 17 defined as members ) derived an average radial velocity @xmath17 ( rms=15 ) km  s@xmath18 and a metallicity [ fe / h]=@xmath19 ( rms 0.16 ) dex .",
    "@xcite obtained high resolution spectra for five stars ; they notice that the rv dispersion is very high for an oc , maybe because they observed by chance a large fraction of binaries or because their sample includes field stars with rv similar to the one of be  31 .",
    "they were able to perform an abundance analysis only on one star and derived [ fe / h]@xmath20 .",
    "a similar situation was found by @xcite who obtained high resolution spectra of another two stars , with discrepant rvs -differing also from the values by @xcite- and metallicity ( although the two values , [ fe / h]=@xmath21 and @xmath22 are not too distant ) .",
    "they could not determine which of the two stars , if any , is a true cluster member .",
    "they also noticed that the published proper motions @xcite should be of field stars in the direction of the cluster , given their bright magnitudes . finally , also for be  31 @xcite found a large number of bss .",
    "the first photometry ( in the @xmath23 filters ) of king  8 was published by @xcite , who described a young cluster , with an age of about 5 myr , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite presented bv photographic photometry and low resolution spectra .",
    "she gave @xmath26 ( with a possible differential reddening up to 0.1 mag ) , z@xmath27 , distance from the sun of 3 - 4 kpc , and age 0.8 gyr .",
    "these values were partially changed by @xcite , where @xmath28 and [ fe / h]@xmath29 or @xmath30 dex .",
    "these two works were later used by @xcite to derive a larger distance , @xmath31 , adopting the metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath32 of @xcite , based on two stars observed at low resolution . @xcite",
    "re - discovered king  8 in their automated search for new ocs on the 2mass images .",
    "they derived the cluster parameters using isochrones in the @xmath33 plane , finding @xmath34 , distance from the sun of 2.4 kpc , and age 1.1 gyr .",
    "they also noted that their numbers differ from what is listed in the @xcite catalogue .    in summary , even if apparently these three ocs have already been studied , their properties are still insecure .",
    "be  23 could be rather young and metal rich ( @xcite : 0.79 gyr , [ fe / h]=+0.07 ) or rather old and metal - poor ( @xcite : 1.8 gyr , [ fe / h]=@xmath35 ) .",
    "be  31 could be very old or of intermediate age , and at very different galactocentric radii ( @xcite : 8 gyr , 13 kpc ; @xcite : 2.2 gyr , 17 kpc ) , while there is some concordance on @xmath36 around 0.13 - 0.15 and metallicity around @xmath37 dex ( but with caveats on membership ) .",
    "king  8 has probably an age around 1 gyr and sub - solar metallicity but the reddening and distance are uncertain ( @xcite : @xmath36=0.55 , d@xmath38=5.24 kpc ; @xcite : @xmath36=0.44 , d@xmath38=2.4 kpc ) .    in the present paper",

    "a discussion and summary is presented in sec .",
    "the three clusters were observed in service mode at the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) on mt .",
    "graham ( arizona ) with the large binocular camera ( lbc ) in 2008 .",
    "there are two lbcs , one optimised for the uv - blue filters and one for the red - ir ones , mounted at each prime focus of the lbt .",
    "each lbc uses four eev chips ( 2048@xmath394608 pixels ) placed three in a row , and the fourth rotated @xmath40 with respect to the others .",
    "the field of view of lbc is equivalent to 23@xmath3923 , with a pixel sampling of 0.23 . for technical reasons , only lbc - blue was available at the time of our observations , so we collected only @xmath41 and @xmath42 data .",

    "we obtained a few shallow images using dolores ( device optimised for for the low resolution ) at the italian telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) on a night dedicated to another programme and to service observations .",
    "for this instrument the field of view is @xmath43 , with a scale of 0.252 /pix .",
    "the seeing was bad ( about 3 ) but this is not a problem since the fields are not crowded .",
    "only the central part of the clusters was observed , barely reaching stars at the turn - off of the main sequence .",
    "the two standard star fields pg0918 + 029 and pg1323 - 085 from @xcite were also obtained .",
    "given the large area covered by lbc and the small angular dimensions of our targets ( see sections [ prof ] , [ fit ] ) we only reduced two of the four chips , the one centered on the cluster ( chip # 2 ) and a second one to be used as a comparison to separate the cluster from the field stars ( chip # 1 ) .",
    "the raw lbc images were corrected for bias and flat field , and the overscan region was trimmed using a pipeline specifically developed for lbc image prereduction by the large survey center team at the rome astronomical observatory .",
    "the source detection and relative photometry was performed independently on each b and v image , using the psf - fitting code daophotii / allstar @xcite .",
    "the brightest stars , saturated in the deepest images , where efficiently recovered through the accurate magnitude measures from the short exposure time images .",
    "the average and the standard error of the mean of the independent measures obtained from the different images were adopted as the final values of the instrumental magnitude and uncertainty .",
    "more than 300 stars from the _ guide star catalogue 2.3 _ where used as astrometric standards to find an accurate astrometric solution to transform the instrumental positions , in pixels , into j2000 celestial coordinates . to this aim",

    "scatter of the solution was @xmath44 in both ra and dec .",
    "we derived the completeness level of the photometry by means of extensive artificial stars experiments following the recipe described in @xcite .",
    "more than 150000 artificial stars have been uniformly distributed on the chip sampling the cluster in groups of 9000 stars at a time , to avoid changing the crowding conditions .",
    "the whole data reduction process has been repeated as in the real case and the fraction of recovered stars was estimated at each magnitude level .",
    "we also checked that the completeness does not change from the central to the external parts .",
    "results for the three clusters are presented in table  [ compl ] .    with the standard stars observed at the tng we derived the following calibration equations @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the calibrated magnitudes and @xmath48 the instrumental ones ( after aperture correction ) . finally , the deep lbt catalogues were cross - correlated with the calibrated , shallow tng ones and the stars in common were used as ",
    "secondary standards \" to extend the calibration to the whole catalogues , both for the central and the external chip .",
    "we produced three catalogues with identification , equatorial coordinates , @xmath41 and @xmath42 magnitudes , with errors containing about 3600 , 6500 , and 4000 stars for be  23 , be  31 , and king  8 , respectively .",
    "these catalogues will be made public through the webda .",
    "[ cmdall ] shows the resulting cmds from our photometry for the central and comparison field chips ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) . in the upper panels we also indicate the photometric errors in magnitude and colour as derived from extensive artificial star tests .",
    "they range from less than 0.01 mag at the bright limit to less than 0.1 mag around @xmath49 .",
    "the three ocs are visible over the field background , but they represent a minority of the stars in each frame . in the most favourable case , be  31 , the main sequence is rather tight and clearly extended down to @xmath50 , while for be  23 and king  8 the ms is recognisable from the field with some difficulty .",
    "a discussion of the field population sampled in these cmds is presented in sect .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t3 ]    in contrast with what is found for be  23 and be  31 , all explored models match very well the lower ms ( at least up to @xmath51 ) .",
    "on the other hand , as a consequence of the high differential reddening , all synthetic cmds show a rather elongated rc while the observed rc is round and concentrated .",
    "[ king8_b ] summarises the best fitting cmd for each set of tracks compared with the data cmd ( top left panel ) .        with the fst models ,",
    "both the solar and the half - solar metallicities fail to reproduce the rc colour ( bluer than observed ) and the number of stars around the mstp phase ( systematically underestimated ) .",
    "a much better result is achieved using the @xmath52 models , whose synthetic cmds account for the rc colour , although still predicting too few mstp stars . in terms of age , the @xmath52 case corresponds to about 1.1 gyr , while the best fit distance is about @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , the high reddening implied by the metallicity @xmath52 is in good agreement with the literature value ( @xmath54 ) based on the @xcite maps , while the reddening solutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , required by the metal richer tracks , are too low or barely acceptable , respectively .",
    "in contrast with the fst result , among the padova models only those at solar metallicity predict the correct rc colour , whereas the synthetic rc is too blue ( by about 0.1 mag ) at @xmath57 and @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "no significant difference is found in the best fit age with varying metallicity : with @xmath59 the best cmd is for 1.3 gyr , while with @xmath58 it is 1.1 gyr , results which are almost identical to the fst findings .",
    "focusing on the mstp , both padova and fst tracks share the same mismatch ( which is to be ascribed to the overshooting ) : the predicted number of mstp stars is always underestimated . as found for the fst models , the comparison with the @xcite maps reddening favours the lowest metallicity ( @xmath52 ) , in contrast with our photometric estimate .    as far as the franec models are concerned",
    ", we do nt find a clear indication to prefer one metallicity over the others .",
    "both the observed mstp counts and the lower ms colours are fairly well reproduced ( the latter down to @xmath60 ) , while the mismatch here concerns the predicted number of rc stars ( whose colours are in good agreement with the observations ) , which outnumber the observed counts by a factor of 3 .",
    "the resulting ages ( 0.8 - 0.9 gyr ) are younger than those obtained with the padova and fst models , as a direct consequence of the lack of overshooting .",
    "once again , only the sub - solar models ( @xmath61 and @xmath52 ) imply a reddening value compatible with the @xcite estimate .    also for this cluster",
    "the comparison to previous results is not simple .",
    "we seem to agree , apart from the padova solution , on a rather low metal content .",
    "the apparent agreement with @xcite is not significant , given the differences between the two photometries ( see fig .",
    "[ confking8 ] ) .",
    "@xcite adopted solar isochrones for all their clusters and this could at least partly explain the differences , although the dependence on metallicity should be smaller in the near ir bands .",
    "be  31 and be  23 are rather far away from both the galactic centre and the galactic plane .",
    "berkeley 31 has a galactocentric distance ( @xmath62 ) between 15.4 kpc and 15.9 kpc and a height above the galactic plane between 693 pc and 739 pc , while berkeley 23 has a @xmath62 between 13.1 kpc and 14.2 kpc and a height between 494 pc and 594 pc .",
    "such scale heights could be the result of a formation in situ as a part of the thick disc population , as also suggested by the old age of be  31 ( well over 2 gyr ) , or due to a disc flaring which gradually increases the galactic scale - height of the thin disc . on the other hand , the shorter scale height ( between 196 pc and 236 pc ) , its @xmath62 between 11.6 kpc and 12.3 kpc and the younger ( probably less than 1 gyr ) age make king  8 a likely member of the thin disc .",
    "such findings help to interpret the difference in the field population between the direction of be  23 and be  31 and the direction of king  8 visible in the lower panels of fig . [ cmdall ] . in the former ,",
    "a structure to the blue of the clusters main sequence is clearly visible starting from @xmath63 .",
    "such a contamination is a signature of a much farther and probably older population along the line of sight .",
    "the most likely candidate is the above mentioned thick disc ( see e.g. @xcite ) , whose scale height is at least three times longer than the corresponding thin disc .",
    "although less probable , it may also represents a tidal debris of a disrupted galaxy ( see e.g. the monoceros ring , @xcite ) or a signature of the galactic warp and flare @xcite . on the other hand , the lack of this feature in the direction of king  8 is mostly due to the closer proximity to the galactic plane ( 3 degrees against @xmath64 degrees of be  23 and be  31 ) . at this latitude",
    "the line of sight goes deeper into the thin disc ( for about 6 kpc ) before crossing a pure thick disc sample , making the thin disc stars the dominant contaminant .",
    "furthermore , the galactic reddening increases with distance ; this explains the elongated shape of the m - dwarfs sequence ( around @xmath65 ) exhibited by the king  8 cmd field , a circumstance that is not observed either in be  23 or in be  31 ( where the m - dwarf sequence is rather vertical ) .",
    "our study of open clusters is aimed at better understanding the chemical and structural properties of the galaxy . in this paper",
    "we have studied three distant open clusters toward the galactic anti - centre using deep lbt photometry .",
    "the cmds resulting from these data are more precise and more than three mag deeper than the ones found in literature , extending to more than six mag below the ms tos .",
    "the synthetic cmd technique has been used to derive a confidence interval for age , metallicity , binary fraction , reddening , and distance for each cluster . to remove the model dependence of the results three different sets of stellar tracks ( padova , fst , franec )",
    "have been adopted . from the comparison between models and data we have drawn the following conclusions :    * be 31",
    "is located at about 15 - 16 kpc from the galactic centre and about 700 pc above the galactic plane .",
    "the resulting age varies from 2.3 gyr to 2.9 gyr , depending on the adopted stellar model , with better fits for ages between 2.3 gyr and 2.5 gyr . concerning the metallicity we obtained a good match using the sets of models with metal content lower than solar .",
    "the mean galactic reddening @xmath36 is between 0.095 and 0.185 mag and the fraction of binaries is between 22% and 26% . *",
    "be 23 is at about 13 - 14 kpc from the galactic centre and 500 - 600 pc above the plane .",
    "the age is well constrained between 1.1 and 1.3 gyr , while the best fitting metallicity is more uncertain : the cmd fit suggests a solar value , while only a half - solar metallicity is compatible with the @xcite estimate for the be 23 s direction .",
    "the mean galactic reddening @xmath36 is between 0.225 and 0.425 and the binary fraction is between 20% and 30% . *",
    "king 8 is at about 12 kpc from the galactic centre and about 200 pc above the plane .",
    "the strong differential reddening up to @xmath66 mag broadens the colour extension of the ms , hindering a precise estimate of the cluster parameters . in this condition ,",
    "the best fitting age is 0.8 - 1.3 gyr , while the entire range of metallicities ( 0.004 - 0.02 ) is consistent with the data . on the other hand ,",
    "only sub - solar models lead to reddening estimates ( ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath67 ) in agreement with @xcite .",
    "a 30% of binaries is compatible with the observed cmd .    with these results ,",
    "be  31 and be  23 are candidate thick disc open clusters , while king  8 is a more classical thin disc member .",
    "only further direct spectroscopic and kinematic searches will allow to shed light on the galactic origin of these clusters .",
    "they will also be very important for any study of the radial distribution of metallicity ( and chemical abundances ) in the galactic disc , a crucial ingredient in chemical evolution models .    our choice to exploit the rc position even if it is barely visible in the three clusters deserves a final comment .",
    "for be  31 , which shows the least defined rc , many other relevant and well defined cmd features ( rh , mstp , rgb , sharp ms ) are available .",
    "hence , even without using the rc we would get the same parameter estimates .",
    "moreover , the @xcite estimate of the reddening in this direction can be safely used as an additional constraint . on the other hand ,",
    "the cmds of be  23 and king  8 are both sufficiently contaminated and affected by reddening that the rc position is a necessary constraint to derive their ages . relaxing",
    "the assumption on the rc position greatly expands the range of possible ages and the only derivable result is that both clusters are certainly younger than 2 gyr .",
    "still , we believe that , although admittedly few , the stars in the cmd rc region are most likely cluster members and can therefore be used in the analysis .",
    "a definitive confirmation clearly needs proper motion or radial velocity studies .    with the present study",
    "we may have reached the limit of what is possible to derive simply with photometric data .",
    "next step will be provided by gaia , the satellite due to fly in about two years , which will produce photometry for about 10@xmath68 galactic objects , and most importantly , parallaxes and proper motions of unprecedented precision .",
    "the expected performances of gaia will permit to obtain individual distances of rc stars better than 10% up to 8 - 10 kpc from the sun , i.e. , including almost the entire family of known ocs .",
    "the precision on proper motions will be even better ( the estimated error on proper motions is about half the one on parallax ) , so that membership for a large fraction of stars will be available also for distant clusters",
    ". this will be important especially in cases like be  31 , where the separation in radial velocity between field and cluster stars is very small ( see introduction ) .",
