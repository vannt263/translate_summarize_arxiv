    "a fundamental prediction of the cosmological ( @xmath0 ) cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) theory is that virialized dark matter halos should have universal density profiles .",
    "an empirical fit formula for the spherically averaged density distribution @xmath2 had been proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , 1997 , nfw )    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two in principle free but for a given cosmological model strongly correlated parameters .",
    "this density distribution converges to power - law functions at small radii ( @xmath6 ) and at large radii ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) later on argued that the inner cusp may even be steeper with @xmath8 .",
    "the power - law behaviour has been a matter of strong debate .",
    "recent simulations , e.g. by power et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and reed et al .",
    "( 2005 ) demonstrate that the cdm halo density profiles are better represented by a function with a continuously varying slope and no convergence to a power - law slope at small radii . a revised fitting formula was derived by navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , where the slope at the innermost radius is about -1.2 for spiral galaxies and -1.35 for dwarfs .",
    "merritt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the srsic ( 1968 ) law fits high - resolution @xmath0cdm halos with a wide range of masses with a srsic index of @xmath9 which is usually used as a good fit of the surface brightness profiles of the centres of early - type galaxies .",
    "however , as we can typically trace rotation curves observationally in the regime of @xmath10 , the nfw profiles still provide a good description to the dark matter halos in galaxies .",
    "the cdm predictions have been confronted with observations , investigating the rotation curves of disk galaxies .",
    "numerous mass models of spiral , dwarf and lsb galaxies have shown that in a large number of cases the inferred cores of dark matter halos are much shallower than expected from the nfw - fit ( flores & primack 1994 , moore 1994 , burkert 1995 , salucci & burkert 2000 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , gentile et al .",
    "2004 ) . the cored density distribution ( burkert 1995 )",
    "@xmath11    fits the data often very well , indicating that , in contrast to cosmological predictions , the maximum density of dark halos is finite .",
    "donato et al . ( 2004 ) even found a strong correlation between the core radius @xmath12 and the dynamical mass indicating again that the observed cored dark matter halos represent a 1-parameter family .",
    "this contradiction between theoretical predictions and observations has stimulated a lot of discussions as it has the potential to provide interesting new insights into the nature of dark matter and its possible interaction with visible matter ( for reviews see primack 2004 or ostriker & steinhardt 2003 ) . in this letter",
    "we will explore the possibility that solid - body rotation curves which are usually interpreted as a signature of constant density cores would arise naturally also in nfw halos as a result of a triaxial dark matter mass distribution that hides the steep central density cusp inducing deviations from axial symmetry in the disk ( e.g. hayashi et al .",
    "2004 ) ; see however gnedin et al .",
    "2004 and kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 for the effect of baryons reducing halo triaxiality .",
    "the deviations from axial symmetry in the gas kinematics can be tested observationally with galaxies showing two - dimensional velocity fields that are clearly inconsistent with a nfw profile .",
    "an ideal case is the nearby dwarf galaxy ddo  47 for which hi observations ( walter & brinks 2001 ) with adequate resolution and sensitivity exist ; these data show that the kinematics of the gas is very regular , with a well - behaved velocity field ( fig .",
    "ddo 47 is one of the most clear cases with kinematical properties that are inconsistent with nfw .",
    "a first rotation curve of ddo 47 was presented in walter & brinks ( 2001 ) and a more detailed decomposition , performed by salucci , walter & borriello ( 2003 ) , shows that a nfw halo is inconsistent with the data .",
    "they also show that the halo of ddo  47 has a central constant - density core : the rotation curve was successfully fitted with a burkert halo with @xmath12=7 kpc and @xmath13 g @xmath14 ( assuming a distance of 4 mpc , and 1 arcmin corresponds to 1.16 kpc ) ; any other cored halo ( e.g. pseudo - isothermal ) gives equally good fits to the rotation curve .",
    "we show the burkert fit in fig .",
    "2 , where the rotation curve was derived by leaving the position angle as a free parameter , in order to better trace the warp .",
    "the error bars are derived from the difference between the two sides , also considering a minimum error of half the velocity resolution , corrected by the inclination .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "2 is the nfw fit ; differently from salucci , walter & borriello ( 2003 ) we do not fix the virial mass @xmath15 by matching the last velocity point , but we leave it instead as a free parameter , the concentration parameter @xmath16 scaling as @xmath17 ( wechsler et al .",
    "2002 ) .    here",
    "we subject the same data to a more thorough analysis , carried out in the light of the above discussion .",
    "the spatial resolution of the datacube ( @xmath18 300  pc ) is similar to that of the dwarf galaxy simulations performed by navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    we have made a tilted - ring analysis of the velocity field with the inclination and the centre fixed at the same values as used by walter & brinks ( 2001 ) . as noticed by these authors , leaving the inclination @xmath19 as a free parameter does not give a very stable result . in order for a possible radial change of @xmath19 to account for the discrepancy with the @xmath0cdm predictions , @xmath19 should increase as a function of radius . instead , as is shown in fig .",
    "3 , the tilted - ring fit with the inclination free ( with 35@xmath20 as initial guess ) suggests that the radial change of the inclination , if any , goes in the opposite direction ( i.e. @xmath19 seems to get larger and not smaller for small radii ) .",
    "note that in this figure we have fixed the position angle at an average value ( separately for each radius ) between fits made with different values of the inclination , between 5@xmath20 and 65@xmath20 .",
    "therefore , considering that there is no evidence for an increase of the inclination , we conclude that fixing the inclination at 35@xmath20 is a reasonable assumption for the aim of this paper .",
    "we have also found that a slight change in the systemic velocity ( 273  km  s@xmath1 instead of 272  km  s@xmath1 ) decreases the differences between the two sides .",
    "in order to better investigate the kinematic properties of ddo 47 , we have fitted the velocity field in terms of harmonic coefficients , where the observed velocity along the line of sight @xmath21 is given by :    @xmath22\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the azimuthal angle defined as the angle from the major axis of the receding side in a counterclockwise direction . in this analysis we only considered terms up to @xmath24 . in the case of a rotating disk plus axisymmetric radial motion ( i.e. the traditional tilted - ring fit of the velocity field ) , only terms up to @xmath25 are present and @xmath26 ( the systemic velocity ) , @xmath27 ( the rotation velocity , and @xmath19 is the inclination angle ) , and @xmath28 ( the radial velocity ) .",
    "more detailed descriptions of this method and its applications can be found in schoenmakers , franx and de zeeuw ( 1997 ) , schoenmakers ( 1999 ) and wong , blitz & bosma ( 2004 ) .",
    "the results of the harmonic decomposition of the velocity field are shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the parameters were fitted with a fixed inclination ( 35@xmath29 ) and the position angle left as a free parameter .",
    "first of all it can be noticed that the @xmath30 term is negligible and that the @xmath31 term is larger but still has a small amplitude , at most 3 km s@xmath1 . the fact that @xmath32 is to be expected , as ddo 47 has a low inclination and this fraction is a strong function of inclination ( schoenmakers 1999 ) . as shown by schoenmakers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , a global elongation of the potential would cause the @xmath31 term to be approximately constant and non - zero , while wiggles could be explained by the presence of spiral structure . in ddo 47",
    "the latter case applies , we find no evidence for a global elongation of the potential and the amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller ( a factor 5 - 10 ) than the discrepancy with the @xmath0cdm predictions",
    "4 also shows that some lopsidedness is present , since the @xmath33 terms are non - zero . in the residual velocity field ( fig .",
    "5 ) we find that the regions with residuals larger than 5 km @xmath1 ( 9 km @xmath1 deprojected ) are not a common feature .",
    "the innermost ones are likely to be associated to either star - forming regions or to the possible bar , while the outermost ones are probably due to asymmetry in the outer warp .",
    "as can be seen in walter & brinks ( 2001 ) , the major axis of the stellar body seems to be a bit misaligned with the hi disk , and low - level non - circular motions associated to the optical part of the galaxy can be seen in the velocity field .",
    "unfortunately due to the large number of stars in the field a more thorough analysis of the possible bar structure in the optical image is not possible .",
    "if the @xmath34 km s@xmath1 region around 60 - 70@xmath35 were associated to a barred potential , its amplitude would anyway be much lower than needed to reconcile the rotation curve with the @xmath0cdm predictions .",
    "we have discussed so far two of the three effects that according to rhee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) could bias the rotation curve ( the inclination and the bar ) . concerning the third effect ,",
    "i.e. the influence of a possible bulge , these authors claim that the random motions of the bulge material could bias the observed rotation velocities towards the systemic velocity .",
    "however in ddo 47 visual inspection of the velocity profiles shows that they are symmetric .",
    "this was further assessed by building a velocity field where the velocity at any point is given by the peak of the profile : if the profiles were strongly asymmetric , the difference between this peak velocity field and a first - moment velocity field would be large and the separation between approaching and receding side should be evident . instead , we see small deviations and no obvious separation between the two sides",
    ".    we can therefore conclude that the non - circular motions in ddo 47 are at a level of at most 3 km s@xmath1 and that they are not associated with a global elongation of the potential . as a particular case in fig .",
    "6 we show the minor axis kinematics of ddo 47 : the velocity shows very small deviations from zero ; the analysis performed earlier gives a more general result , making use of the whole velocity field to derive the amount of non - circular motions .",
    "we conclude that the global discrepancy between observations and @xmath0cdm predictions shown in fig .",
    "2 can not be explained by non - circular motions induced by halo triaxiality , regardless of the viewing angle .",
    "we have presented a dynamical analysis of hi data of the dwarf galaxy ddo 47 to test the hypothesis that the possible triaxial shape of the dark matter halo might induce deviations from circular motions resulting in a rotation curve best fitted by a cored halo , with the dark matter halo being still cdm - like ( i.e. , cuspy ) .",
    "the high - quality hi observations of ddo 47 make it an ideal case to test this hypothesis because it has a very regular velocity field , its rotation curve is best fitted by a cored halo and a nfw halo is inconsistent with the data ( salucci et al .",
    "even though our analysis indicates a cored dark matter halo profile for ddo 47 , work to test the effect of different halo shapes and disk / halo alignments on the shapes of rotation curves is clearly very valuable .",
    "we have performed a harmonic decomposition of the velocity field in order to estimate the amount of non - circular motions .",
    "we find that they are at a level of at most 3 km s@xmath1 and that they are likely to be associated to spiral structure rather than to a global elongation of the potential . in any case",
    "the observed deviations from circular motion are much smaller than the discrepancy between @xmath0cdm predictions and the observed rotation curve .",
    "we conclude therefore that the dark matter halo around the dwarf galaxy ddo 47 is truly cored and that a cusp can not be hidden by non - circular motions .",
