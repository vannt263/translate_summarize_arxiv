    "during the last twenty years the wilson approach@xcite to the renormalization group ( rg ) has been the subject of a revival in both statistical physics and field theory .",
    "two main formulations of the non perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) have been developed in parallel . in the first one , a continuous realization of the rg transformation of the hamiltonian @xmath0 $ ]",
    "is made and no expansion is involved with respect to some small parameter of the action @xmath0 $ ] . at scale-@xmath1 ( in momentum space ) the high energy modes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , have been integrated out in @xmath0 $ ] which requires the implementation of some cut - off of the propagator aiming at separating slow ( @xmath4 ) and fast ( @xmath3 ) modes .",
    "the flow of the action is governed by either by the wilson - polchinski equation@xcite in case of a smooth cut - off or the wegner - houghton@xcite equation in case of a sharp cut - off .",
    "these equations , due to their complexity , call for the use of approximation and/or truncation methods .",
    "we refer to the recent review of bagnuls and bervillier@xcite of a detailed discussion of this version of the nprg .",
    "the second formulation , called the effective average action approach , was developed after the seminal works of nicoll and chang ( sharp cut - off version)@xcite and wetterich ( smooth cut - off version)@xcite .",
    "this method implements on the effective action @xmath5 $ ] -the gibbs free energy of the fast modes @xmath6 , @xmath3- rather than on @xmath7 the ideas of integration of high - energy modes that underlies any rg approach .",
    "the flow of @xmath8 results in equations which can be solved under the same kind of approximations than those used for the wilson - polchinski or wegner - houghton equations .",
    "recent reviews and lectures on this second approach are available@xcite and will be consulted with profit .",
    "it must be stressed that these two approaches of the nprg are of course equivalent as long as the exact equations are considered but may yield different results when approximations are introduced at some stage@xcite .",
    "the effective average action method has been applied successfully to compute with accuracy the critical exponents of the ising model non perturbatively for instance@xcite and also to tackle with other highly non - trivial problems of condensed matter physics such that reaction - diffusion processes@xcite , frustrated magnets@xcite or the kosterlitz - thouless transition@xcite , etc .    in this paper",
    "we implement the method of the effective average action for simple classical liquids .",
    "this can be done either in the framework of a statistical field theory of liquids@xcite or in the usual grand canonical ( gc ) formalism@xcite of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the first rg approach to the theory of simple fluids and mixtures was proposed more than twenty years ago in a series of outstanding papers by reatto , parola and co - workers who developed the so - called hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) which gives an accurate description of the thermodynamics and the structure of a wide class of fluids close to and away from the critical region ( for a review see reference@xcite ) .",
    "it turns out@xcite that hrt is equivalent to the nprg with sharp cut - off of nicoll and chang @xcite .",
    "the hrt will be obtained here as a highly singular limit of a regular nprg equation , i.e. as an ultra - sharp cut - off limit .",
    "we claim that the theory discussed in this paper is free of the flaws which affect hrt in the sub - critical region , i.e. that the coexistence and spinodal curves merge into a single curve@xcite .",
    "it is likely -and some arguments will be developed in that sense- that the singularity of the limit in which hrt is obtained is the cause of its shortcomings giving little hope to improve the theory by considering more sophisticated approximations and/or truncations such that those proposed recently@xcite ; see however a little known paper of parola@xcite .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section  ( [ rg - gc ] )",
    "we present our nprg theory in the framework of the grand canonical of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "we consider only the case of a fluid of hard spheres with additional attractive pair interactions although the generalization to multicomponent fluids would be trivial . after some prolegomena aimed at resuming the basics notions of the theory of liquids and at fixing our notations (",
    "section  ( [ prolego ] ) ) the exact rg flow of the free energy @xmath9 and the direct correlation functions are obtained in sections  ( [ flow - a ] ) and  ( [ flow - direct ] ) respectively .",
    "the derivation of the rg flow given here is elementary and does not call for the sophisticated mathematical apparatus developed for and applied in , deriving the hrt hierarchy . by the way , the genuine hrt flow is obtained as a singular limit of our own smooth cut - off nprg equations in section  ( [ hhrt ] ) where we point out that some the hrt flow equations for the direct correlation functions are ill - defined .",
    "section  ( [ rg - ksshe ] ) is devoted to a transposition of the results of section  ( [ rg - gc ] ) in the framework of the ksshe theory of liquids .",
    "this scalar field theory of liquids is obtained after performing a ksshe transformation@xcite of the gc boltzmann s factor and was studied intensively these past few years@xcite .",
    "ksshe theory is a non - canonical field theory in the sense that the coupling between the source ( the chemical potential for liquids ) and the field is non linear which makes a direct comparison with wetterich nprg difficult .",
    "a mapping of ksshe theory ( and thus of the gc formalism ) with a canonical field theory is however possible and discussed at length in section  ( [ rg - canonic ] ) .",
    "our key result is that the flows of the average affective action @xmath8 of the canonical theory ( governed by wetterich equations ) and that of the free energy @xmath9 ( governed by the equations obtained in section  ( ii ) ) coincide ( cf section  ( [ lien ] ) .",
    "this mapping makes possible the transposition of all known - properties of the nprg flows for canonical scalar field theories to the theory of liquids .",
    "an important consequence of this property is that our smooth cut - off nprg theory for liquids yields a non - vanishing compressibility along the coexistence curve and is thus free of the shortcomings of hrt along subcritical isotherms ( see section ( [ comments ] ) ) . as an illustration of the issues of sections  ( ii , iii , iv ) we study the case of the kac model@xcite in section  ( v ) . in this case",
    "the flow can be solved exactly by two complementary methods .",
    "we conclude in section  ( vi ) .",

    "we first remark that , at the beginning of the flow , i.e. for @xmath500 , the initial conditions are such that that @xmath531 for all @xmath88 .",
    "it follows then from the flow equation  ( [ flowy ] ) that @xmath532 and therefore the flow does not start immediately . in this initial stage of immobility @xmath533 for all @xmath88 , while @xmath532 if @xmath534 .",
    "now , if @xmath478 then @xmath535 remains strictly positive for all @xmath88 when @xmath504 varies from @xmath500 ( @xmath135 ) to @xmath502 ( @xmath136 ) .",

    "therefore @xmath543 for @xmath544 . for @xmath545 or @xmath546",
    "the flow has not yet started and @xmath505 remains equal to its initial value @xmath464 . in order to determine the unknown functions @xmath547 , @xmath548 , @xmath549 and @xmath550 we invoke the continuity of the functions @xmath551 and @xmath552 which can be inferred from the general flow equation  ( [ flow - fk2 ] ) .",

    "the starting point of the flow @xmath561 corresponds to @xmath562 , i.e to the inverse critical temperature of kac model .",
    "moreover @xmath563 coincides with the coexistence chemical potential of the kac model at inverse temperature @xmath558 and @xmath564 with minus the pressure at coexistence . our final result can be summarized as @xmath565 at the end of the flow , i.e. for @xmath502 , one has @xmath566 and thus @xmath567 as given by equations  ( [ jojo1 ] ) and  ( [ jojo2 ] ) .    to conclude this section",
    "let us have a look on the flow of the `` true '' free energy @xmath568 .",
    "it follows from equation  ( [ def - ak ] ) that @xmath569 from which we deduce that @xmath570 which is an obvious result since the k - system is nothing but a kac model at inverse temperature @xmath558 as can be inferred from equations  ( [ zo1 ] ) and  ( [ zo2 ] ) .",
    "this could have been our starting point to solve the flow .",
    "this allows to find the exact solution of the flow without solving explicitely equation  ( [ flow - fk2 ] ) , but it is less funny .    to illustrate our result",
    "we have displayed the flow of the running free energy and its two first derivatives with respect to @xmath88 .",
    "figure 1 shows the flow of @xmath498 at a temperature @xmath571 below @xmath435 as @xmath504 varies from @xmath500 to @xmath502 .",
    "this demonstrates the approach of convexity in the inner region when @xmath572 .",
    "figure 2 displays the flow of @xmath573 at the same subcritical temperature , demonstrating the slow construction of the plateau .",
    "finally , in figure 3 we displays the flow of @xmath574 which exhibits a finite discontinuity at the points @xmath575 and @xmath576 . since at @xmath502 , the isothermal compressibility @xmath577 given by @xmath578 , @xmath577 is finite on the binodal although infinite in the coexistence region .",
    "we end this section by pointing out that the hrt flow can not be solved conveniently for the kac model , since at any scale @xmath272 we have @xmath579 , as a consequence of the ultra sharp cut - off . in this case the flow starts and stops exactly at @xmath136 with an uncontrollable singularity .",
    "flow of @xmath574 at @xmath499 .",
    "the compressibility is discontinuous as soon as the flow starts . ]",
    "in this paper we have developed a smooth cut - off nprg theory for simple fluids .",
    "two equivalent versions of the theory were formulated , the first one in the gc ensemble , with an immediate transcription in the framework of ksshe field theory , the second one in the framework of a generic scalar field theory ( with no z2 symmetry ) .",
    "the exact mapping between these two versions was derived in detail .",
    "the hrt is obtained as a highly singular limit of regular smooth cut - off nprg equations .",
    "the inability of hrt to distinguish between the spinodal and binodal curves is probably a consequence of this limit which is only partly controllable ( the flow equations for the @xmath580 with @xmath330 are ill - defined in the scaling limit @xmath157 ) .",
    "this shortcoming is absent of the present theory .",
    "our developments where highly abstract and formal and we did not say anything on the strategy to adopt to solve the nprg flow equations so some comments on this issue are probably wellcome . there are mainly two ways to solve the nprg equations .",
    "a first method is to restrict the functional form of the effective average action @xmath5 $ ] ( or @xmath581 $ ] ) on a restricted functional sub - space .",
    "for instance the simplest ansatz is the so - called local potential ( lpa ) approximation@xcite @xmath582=\\int_x u_k\\left ( \\left(\\phi(x ) \\right ) \\right ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ \\nabla \\phi(x)\\right]^2\\ ] ] where @xmath583 is a _ function _ of the classical field .",
    "the lpa ansatz allready gives non trivial critical exponents ( except @xmath471 ) and is quite easy to solve numerically@xcite .",
    "allready the improvement @xmath584 in equation  ( [ lpa ] ) which includes the renormalization of the wave function and yields @xmath585 makes the results more satisfactory .",
    "it must be precised first that most of the numerical studies of lpa or improved lpa equations were applied to systems with z2 symmetry , i.e. with no direct application to liquids , see however reference@xcite where symmetric and antisymmetric correction - to - scaling exponents are studied in detail . secondly , these ansatz ( including those with more terms in the gradient expansion ) allow to estimate the low - q behavior of _ all _ the vertex but do not give their correct behavior at short distances in direct space .",
    "such methods will not fit with the dogma of the theory of liquids according to which @xmath586 should be zero in the core . in liquids",
    "the equation of state ( i.e. the virial pressure ) results from a delicate balance between energetic and entropic contributions ( i.e. the value of the @xmath586 at contact , that is at @xmath587 ) .",
    "if applied to liquid theory , approximations such as lpa or gradient expansions although giving good estimations of critical exponents will miss this point and would yield a poor estimation of non universal critical properties .",
    "this is why reatto and coworkers considered another strategy to solve their hrt hierarchy .",
    "it consists in closing the tower of equations for the @xmath207 .",
    "contrary to the first strategy high order @xmath207 are ignored but the structure of @xmath204 can be described with good accuracy for all `` @xmath16 '' . in particular one can take advantage of the arbitrariness of @xmath129 in the core to enforce @xmath588 for @xmath589 at each scale - k .",
    "the most recent hrt studies@xcite consider a closure in the spirit of the optimized rpa ( orpa)@xcite @xmath590 where the @xmath591 are taken to provide a basis for a suitable function space over @xmath592 $ ] .",
    "coefficient @xmath593 is chosen to enforce thermodynamic consistency ( i.e @xmath594 ) while the @xmath595 and the @xmath596 will be determined in such a way that @xmath586 is zero in the core with sufficient accuracy .",
    "it seems that this numerical scheme could be adapted to our nprg flow equations , but other schemes proposed recently for solving wetterich flow should also be considered@xcite .",
    "we hope to report progresses on these points in future works .",
    "i attended the lectures of b. delamotte on the nprg in spring 2005 at jussieu university ( paris - france ) which was a marvelous introduction to the subject .",
    "the interested reader is urged to consult his lecture notes which are available on the web @xcite .",
