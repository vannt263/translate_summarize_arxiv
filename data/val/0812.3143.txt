    "the algorithm is applied to simulation of dynamics of @xmath34 and @xmath160 cold atoms in the double - well trap .",
    "the dynamics reflects a competition between the hopping rate of the atoms from well to well and the two - body repulsive interaction between the particles .",
    "the single - particle observables of the system are simulated and the convergence of the simulation is checked .",
    "the simulation is based on numerical solution of the stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( snlse ) , which governs a single realization of the surrogate open - system dynamics .",
    "the open - system dynamics can be interpreted as a weak measurement of the elements of spectrum - generating @xmath0 algebra of the single - particle observables .",
    "it is shown that a range of the measurement strength exists , where on one hand the dynamics of the target observables is negligibly affected by the measurement but on the other hand the measurement is strong enough to localize solutions of the snlse in the associated phase - space .",
    "the localization leads to a drastic reduction of the computational complexity of the snlse compared to the original schrdinger equation .",
    "the algorithm employs a time - dependent basis of the spin - coherent states .",
    "asymptotically the number of states in the basis scales logarithmically with the hilbert space dimension @xmath20 for the simulation on the time - interval of order @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the memory resources and the cost of an elementary time - step of the simulation are reduced by the factor @xmath161 compared to conventional sparse - matrix algorithms for solving the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "the number of the time - steps per unit time for the convergent simulation on the fixed time interval scales as @xmath162 , i.e. , is smaller by the factor @xmath162 than in conventional methods .",
    "this leads to the overall scaling of @xmath163 of the computational resources for solving the snlse .",
    "the estimate of @xmath164 scaling of the number of time - steps is rooted in the present linear implementation of the algorithm .",
    "it is possible that the more flexible nonlinear implementation will lead to a better scaling .",
    "solution of the snlse corresponds to a single realization of the surrogate open system dynamics . to obtain a reasonable accuracy of the simulation solutions of the snlse",
    "are averaged over @xmath165 realizations .",
    "though in practice the averaging increases substantially the computational cost of the simulation , the number of realizations is independent on @xmath2 and does not contribute to the asymptotic scaling .",
    "an important additional feature of the algorithm is that realizations of the open system dynamics can be simulated in parallel , which is advantageous from the computational standpoint .",
    "simulating dynamics on the time - interval of order @xmath26 is necessary to observe the generalized purity loss , corresponding to depletion of the condensate , which is not seen in a mean - field approximation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath26 factor can not be removed from the overall scaling of the algorithm and an _ efficient _ simulation of the depletion of the condensate is impossible in the sense of our definition .",
    "it is conjectured that generally a logarithmic factor is present in the scaling of the computational resources with the hilbert space dimension in a simulation of quantum many - body effects , i.e. , effects that can not be accounted for by a mean - field dynamics .",
    "this is because generically the mean - field approximation is broken when the generalized coherent state with respect to the sga approaches the hyperbolic fixed point of the associated mean - field dynamics .",
    "the breakdown sets in when the distance to the fixed point becomes of the order of the total uncertainty of the generalized coherent state .",
    "the corresponding time - scale is of the order of the logarithm of the total uncertainty , which is of the order of the maximal weight of the hilbert space representation of the sga , increasing with the hilbert space dimension .",
    "to summarize , the algorithm described in the present work reduces the memory resources , the cost of an elementary time - step of the simulation and the cpu time resources compared to conventional sparse - matrix approaches . as a consequence , asymptotically , it outperforms conventional sparse - matrix computations by the factor @xmath3 .",
    "it is conjectured that implementation of the algorithm to simulate many - body dynamics with other sga will prove advantageous as well .",
