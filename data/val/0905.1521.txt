    "in the past decade , there has been a considerable interest in characterizing and understanding the structural properties of networked systems  @xcite .",
    "it has been established that scale - free behavior  @xcite is one of the most fundamental concepts for a basic understanding of the organization of many real - world systems in nature and society .",
    "this scale - free property has a profound effect on almost every aspect on dynamic processes taking place on networks  @xcite , including robustness  @xcite , percolation  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , games  @xcite , epidemic spreading  @xcite , to name just a few .",
    "for instance , for a wide range of scale - free networks an epidemic threshold does not exist , and even infections with a low spreading rate will prevail over the entire population in these networks  @xcite . this is a radical change from the conclusions drawn from classical disease modeling  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned dynamics , some authors have focused their attention on the trapping problem occurring on complex networks  @xcite , which is one of the main topic of interest for random walks ( diffusion )  @xcite .",
    "the classical trapping problem first introduced in  @xcite is a random - walk issue , where a trap is located at a fixed position , absorbing all particles that visit it .",
    "an interesting quantity closely related to the trapping problem is the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , which is very important in the study of transport - limited reactions  @xcite , and target search  @xcite , amongst other physical problems .",
    "a result from previous research is that a power - law property can improve the efficiency of transport by diffusion on scale - free networks  @xcite : the mfpt , @xmath6 , scales linearly or sublinearly with the number of network nodes @xmath0 as @xmath7 with @xmath8 or @xmath9 , which shows that the efficiency of trapping processes on scale - free networks is even better than ( at least not worse than ) that on complete graphs  @xcite , the best possible structure for a fast diffusion ( with @xmath10 ) .",
    "although the scale - free topology has a direct effect on other structural characteristics ( e.g. , average path length  @xcite ) of networks and dynamics running on them , it can not reflect all the information of the network structure .",
    "recently , it has been discovered that many real - life networks , such as the www , metabolic networks , and yeast protein interaction networks have self - similar properties and exhibit fractal scaling  @xcite .",
    "this fractal topology is often characterized through the fractal dimension @xmath11 , which can be obtained by the box - counting algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that fractal scaling  @xcite must be considered in an integral basic understanding of the organization of real - life complex systems .    as a fundamental property ,",
    "topological fractality is related to many respects of network structure and function .",
    "recently , several authors have shown that the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality of nodes is much weaker in fractal network models in comparison with non - fractal models  @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown  @xcite that fractal scale - free networks are disassortative  @xcite , and this feature , together with fractality , makes such scale - free networks more robust against intentional attacks on hub nodes , as compared to the highly vulnerable non - fractal scale - free networks  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the distinction in the robustness , fractal networks exhibit lower synchronizability than their non - fractal counterparts  @xcite .",
    "although a lot of efforts have been devoted to fractal scale - free networks  @xcite , it is still of current interest to look for a better understanding of the consequences of a fractal topology on different dynamic processes .    in this paper , we study the trapping dynamics on a fractal scale - free network in the presence of a perfect absorber located at a fixed node .",
    "we obtain a rigorous solution for the mfpt of the unbiased random walks , which is computed through the recurrence relations derived from the network structure .",
    "the resulting formula shows that for a large network , the mfpt , @xmath6 , scales with the network order @xmath0 as @xmath2 .",
    "this superlinear growth is significantly different from the linear or sublinear scaling previously found for nonfractal scale - free networks .",
    "in this section we introduce a network model defined in an iterative way  @xcite , which has attracted a great amount of attention  @xcite .",
    "we call this model _ iterative fractal scale - free tree _ ( ifsft ) .",
    "we study the ifsft because of its intrinsic interest and its relevance to real - world systems .",
    "for example , the so - called border tree motifs have been shown to be present , in a significant way , in real - life networks  @xcite . moreover , the ifsft is deterministic , which allows us to study analytically its topological properties and dynamical processes taking place on it .",
    "it is thus a good test - bed and an ideal substrate network",
    ".     stands for a new external node , while @xmath12 represents an internal node . ]",
    "the ifsft , denoted by @xmath13 after @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) iterations ( the number of iterations is also called generation hereafter ) , is constructed as follows . for @xmath16 , @xmath17 is an edge connecting two nodes . for @xmath18 , @xmath13",
    "is obtained from @xmath19 : for each edges in @xmath19 , two new nodes ( called external nodes with degree of 1 ) are firstly introduced and linked respectively to both ends of the edge ; then , the edge is broken , another new node ( referred to as an internal node ) is positioned in its middle and connected to both ends ( see fig .  [ construct ] ) . in other words , @xmath13 is obtained from @xmath19 by performing the following operations on every edge in @xmath19 : replace the edge by a path of 2 links long , with the two endpoints of the path being the same endpoints of the original edge , then attach a new node to each endpoint of the path .",
    "figure  [ network ] shows the construction process for the first three iterative processes .        according to the network construction",
    ", one can see that at each generation @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) the number of newly introduced nodes is @xmath22 . from this result",
    ", we can easily compute the network order ( i.e. , the total number of nodes ) @xmath23 at generation @xmath14 : @xmath24    to facilitate the description in what follows , we distinguish different nodes of @xmath25 by labeling them as follows . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the newly created internal node is labeled 1 , the initial two nodes belonging to @xmath27 are labeled as 2 and 3 , and the two new external nodes have labels 4 and 5 , see fig .",
    "[ labeling ] . for each new iteration @xmath28",
    ", we label consecutively the new nodes generated at this iteration , while we keep the labels of the old nodes unchanged .",
    "namely , new nodes are labeled sequentially as @xmath29 . in this way",
    ", we label each node by a unique integer : at generation @xmath14 all nodes are labeled from 1 to @xmath30 .",
    "labels of all nodes of @xmath31 . ]",
    "let @xmath32 be the degree of a node @xmath33 at generation @xmath14 , which entered the network at generation @xmath20 ( @xmath34 ) . if node @xmath33 was an external node when it was introduced , @xmath35 otherwise , if @xmath33 was an internal node when it entered the network , @xmath36 from eqs .",
    "( [ ki01 ] ) and  ( [ ki02 ] ) , one can easily see that after each new iteration the degree of a node doubles , i.e. , @xmath37    the ifsft presents some interesting topological characteristics .",
    "it has a power law degree distribution with exponent @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "its average path length , defined as the mean of shortest distances between all pairs of nodes , grows as a square power of the network order  @xcite .",
    "the betweenness distribution of its nodes exhibits a power - law behavior with exponent @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "particulary , it is fractal with the fractal dimension @xmath40 .",
    "after introducing the ifsft , in what follows we will study the mfpt for random walks with a single immobile trap on the network . we will show that the fractal property has an essential influence on the mfpt , i.e. , the fractality can induce a general slowing down of diffusion .",
    "here we formulate the trapping problem of a simple random walk of a particle on the ifsft @xmath25 in the presence of an absorbing trap positioned at the central hub node @xmath41 , represented as @xmath42 .",
    "to this end , we first represent @xmath25 by its adjacency matrix @xmath43 of order @xmath44 .",
    "the entry @xmath45 of @xmath43 is either 1 or 0 : @xmath46 if @xmath33 and @xmath47 are adjacent and @xmath48 otherwise .",
    "the diagonal degree matrix @xmath49 of @xmath25 is @xmath50 .",
    "then , the normalized laplacian matrix of @xmath25 is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the @xmath44 identity matrix .    in the trapping problem , at each time step , a particle , starting from any node except the trap @xmath42 , moves from its current location to any of its nearest neighbors with equal probabilities .",
    "it is easy to see that in the end the particle will be necessarily absorbed by the trap , regardless of its starting location  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the mean transmit time ( first - passage time , or trapping time ) @xmath53 for a particle , originating at node @xmath33 , to first reach the trap @xmath42 in @xmath25 .",
    "such a random walk can be described by a markov chain  @xcite , whose fundamental matrix is the inverse of matrix @xmath54 that is defined as a sub - matrix of the normalized laplacian matrix @xmath55 obtained by deleting from it the first row and column , corresponding to the absorbing node .",
    "the entry @xmath56 of the fundamental matrix @xmath57 expresses the mean residence time , which is the mean number of visitations of node @xmath47 by the particle , starting from node @xmath33 , before trapping occurs .",
    "thus , we have @xmath58 then , the mfpt , @xmath59 , which is the mean of @xmath53 over all nodes distributed uniformly over nodes in @xmath25 other than the trap , is given by @xmath60    equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) shows that the problem of finding @xmath61 is reduced to calculating the sum of all entries of the fundamental matrix @xmath57 .",
    "although the expression of eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) seems compact , since the order , @xmath62 , of @xmath57 increases exponentially with @xmath14 , for large @xmath14 , it becomes impossible to get @xmath61 through direct calculation from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) as we are restricted by time and computer memory , and one can calculate directly the mfpt only for the first iterations , see fig .",
    "however , the particular construction of the ifsft and the special choice of the trap location allow to calculate analytically mfpt to obtain a closed - form formula . the derivation details of which will be provided in the following section",
    ".     mean first - passage time @xmath61 versus network order @xmath23 on a log - log scale .",
    "the numerical results are obtained by direct calculation from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) , while the analytical results are from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt19 ] ) .",
    "the solid line is the guide to the eye . ]",
    "before giving a general formula for mfpt , @xmath59 , we first establish the dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath14 .      for each @xmath14 ,",
    "the values of @xmath53 can be obtained straightforwardly via eq .",
    "( [ mfpt4 ] ) .",
    "table [ tab : amta2 ] lists the numerical values of @xmath53 for nodes for the first several generations up to @xmath63 .",
    "the numerical values quoted in table  [ tab : amta2 ] show that for a given node @xmath33 we have @xmath64 .",
    "that is to say , upon growth of the ifsft from generation @xmath14 to @xmath65 , the mean time to first reach the trap increases by a factor of 8 .",
    "this is a basic characteristic of random walks on the ifsft , which can be established from the arguments below .",
    "consider an arbitrary node @xmath33 in the ifsft @xmath25 . from eq .",
    "( [ ki03 ] ) , we know that at iteration @xmath65 , the degree of node @xmath33 of ifsft doubles , i.e. , it grows from @xmath66 ( degree at iteration @xmath14 ) to @xmath67",
    ". moreover , all these @xmath67 neighbors are new nodes created at iteration @xmath65 , among which @xmath66 neighbors are external nodes , and the rest @xmath66 neighbors are internal nodes .",
    "we now examine the standard random walk in @xmath68 : let @xmath69 be the mean transmit time for a particle starting from node @xmath33 to any of its @xmath66 old neighbors , i.e. , those nodes directly linked to node @xmath33 at iteration @xmath14 ; and let @xmath70 ( resp .",
    "@xmath71 ) be the mean transmit time for going from any of the @xmath66 internal ( resp .",
    "external ) neighbors of @xmath33 to one of the @xmath66 old neighbors .",
    "then the mean transmit times follow the relations : @xmath72 equation  ( [ mfpt6 ] ) has a solution @xmath73 , found by eliminating @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "that is to say , when the network grows from iteration @xmath14 to iteration @xmath65 , the first - passage time from any node @xmath33 to any node @xmath47 ( both @xmath33 and @xmath47 belong to @xmath25 ) increases by a factor of 8 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath64 , which will be useful for the derivation of the exact formula for the mfpt below .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      after obtaining the scaling of mean trapping time for old nodes , we now derive the analytical rigorous expression for the mfpt . before proceeding further ,",
    "we first introduce some notation used in the rest of this section .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the set of nodes in @xmath25 , and let @xmath75 stand for the set of those nodes introduced at generation @xmath14 . to facilitate the computation",
    ", we also define the following quantities for @xmath76 : @xmath77 and @xmath78    by definition , it follows that @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath80 where the relation of @xmath64 has been made use of . hence , to determine @xmath81 , one should first explicitly determine the quantity @xmath82 .",
    "for this purpose , we further separate @xmath75 into two sets : one set of external nodes and the other set of internal nodes as defined in the second section , which are denoted as @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath85 . on the other hand , we have shown that the cardinality of set @xmath75 is @xmath86 , and that @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we can obtain @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "then , two corresponding quantities can be defined : @xmath90 @xmath91 it is obvious that @xmath92        in order to obtain @xmath93 , one may alternatively get @xmath94 and @xmath95 . to this end , we first establish the relationship between the two quantities @xmath96 and @xmath95 . by construction , at a given generation , each edge connecting two nodes @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( see fig .  [ iter ] ) will generate three new nodes in the next generation : two external nodes ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) and one internal node ( @xmath101 ) , and the mean transmit times for these three new nodes satisfy the following relations : @xmath102 hence , we have @xmath103 summing eq .",
    "( [ eq : intext1 ] ) over all old edges at the generation before growth , we can easily obtain that for all @xmath104 , @xmath105 equation ( [ eq : intext2 ] ) gives the relationship between @xmath106 and @xmath107 , which is very significant since it is useful for the computation in the following text .",
    "therefore , the issue of determining @xmath82 is reduced to finding the quantity @xmath108 that can be obtained as follows .",
    "for an arbitrary external node @xmath109 in @xmath25 , which is created at generation @xmath14 and attached to an old node @xmath33 , we have @xmath110 since a particle starting from node @xmath109 will be on node @xmath33 after one jump .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : intextx2 ] ) holds for any node pair consisting of an old node and any one of its new external adjacent nodes . by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : intextx2 ] ) to two sum ( the first one is over a given old node and all its new external nodes , the other is summing the first one over all old nodes ) , we get @xmath111 where eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ttotr ] ) and  ( [ eq : intext2 ] ) were used .",
    "now , we can determine @xmath106 through a recurrence relation , which can be obtained easily .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec1 ] ) , it is not difficult to write out @xmath112 as @xmath113    equation  ( [ eq : rec2 ] ) minus eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec1 ] ) times 16 and making use of the relation @xmath64 , one gets the following recurrence relation @xmath114 considering the initial condition @xmath115 , this recurrence relation is solved to obtain @xmath116 inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : tx1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttotr ] ) and considering the relation @xmath117 , we have @xmath118 substituting the last expression into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttot ] ) yields @xmath119 using @xmath120 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : t2 ] ) is solved inductively @xmath121    inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnew1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) , we obtain the rigorous expression for the mfpt for the trapping problem on the @xmath14-th generation of the ifsft : @xmath122 we have checked this exact solution for the mfpt against numerical values given by eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ trap ] . for all @xmath123 , the analytical values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt19 ] ) are perfectly consistent with the numerical results .",
    "this agreement is an independent test of our theoretical formula .",
    "we show next how to represent mfpt as a function of the network order , with the aim of obtaining the relation between these two quantities .",
    "recalling eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) , we have @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ mfpt19 ] ) can be recast as @xmath126 for a large network , i.e. , @xmath127 , @xmath128 with the exponent @xmath129 much larger than 1 .",
    "thus , in the limit of large network order @xmath23 , the mfpt grows superlinearly with the number of network nodes .",
    "recently , it has been shown that for non - fractal scale - free networks with a large network order @xmath0 , their mfpt @xmath6 behaves linearly or sublinearly with @xmath0 as @xmath4 with @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "however , we have seen that for the ifsfn , the mfpt , @xmath59 , increases superlinearly with @xmath23 ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) irrespective of its scale - free property , presenting an obvious difference from the results previously obtained for its non - fractal scale - free counterparts .",
    "why is the mfpt for the ifsft far larger than that for nonfractal scale - free networks such as the apollonian network  @xcite ? the reasons behind this discrepancy may be explained as follows . for the apollonian network , the large - degree nodes , including the trap node , are directly connected to one another and compose a core group sharing more neighbors , which make the apollonian network be a very compact system .",
    "so , these large - degree nodes can be easily visited by a particle in spite of its starting location .",
    "the interconnection within nodes with large degrees makes the particle spend a short time to find the trap . on the contrary , in the ifsft",
    ", the large - degree nodes are not linked to each other , they are exclusively connected to low - degree nodes , as a result from the fractal property of ifsft . in other words , there is an effective ` repulsion ' between the large - degree nodes in the ifsft  @xcite , which seems to be a main feature that distinguishes the ifsft from the apollonian network .",
    "hence , for the trapping problem in the ifsft , because of the isolation of the large - degree nodes from each other , the particle will first reach a hub node , and before being absorbed it will spend a lot of time in the intermediate regions constituted by small - degree nodes , which connect indirectly the large - degree nodes to one another .",
    "therefore , it takes a longer time for the particle to arrive at the trap .",
    "we have studied a classical trapping problem performed on a deterministically growing scale - free network with fractal topology .",
    "the self - similarity of the network allows us to derive the exact expression for the mfpt .",
    "we have shown that , for large networks , the mfpt increases as a power - law function of the network order , with an exponent much larger than 1 , in contrast with previous results found for non - fractal scale - free networks .",
    "we see that this slow transport efficiency lies with the inherent fractality and its associated disassortativity .",
    "thus , we can infer that scale - free networks do not always tend to accelerate the diffusion processes occurring on them .",
    "our research may be helpful for a better understanding of the role that network structure plays in a trapping process .",
