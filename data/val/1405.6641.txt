    "one of the most basic notions of condensed matter physcis is the quantum mechanical problem of a particle in a periodic potential . yet",
    ", there are still quite fundamental questions relating to the physics of bloch bands that have not been conclusively answered : how can optimally localized real space representations of band insulators in terms of wannier functions ( wfs ) be found systematically and computationally efficiently ?",
    "under which circumstances can even compactly supported wfs exist for a given lattice hamiltonian , or at least for some representative of its topological equivalence class ?",
    "these questions are of key importance not only for electronic band structure calculations within the single particle approximation , e.g. , in the framework of density functional theory @xcite , but also for the dissipative preparation of topological band structures @xcite and their variational representation as a starting point for tensor network methods . in this work ,",
    "we report substantial progress towards a comprehensive answer to these questions , .    [ [ section ] ]    the crucial optimization problem of finding maximally localized wfs @xmath0 associated with a family of @xmath1 occupied bloch vectors @xmath2 @xmath3 defined in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) has been subject of active research for many years @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is a local @xmath4 gauge degree of freedom in reciprocal space acting on the bloch functions as @xmath5 this redundancy in the definition of the bloch functions renders the wannier representation highly non - unique : a different gauge choice on the bloch functions can modify the localization properties of the associated wfs which are defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the volume of the primitive cell in real space and is the spatial dimension of the crystal .",
    "interestingly , the search for maximally localized wfs is substantially influenced by topological aspects of the underlying band structure .",
    "the recent study of band structure topology has led to fundamental discoveries like topological insulators and superconductors @xcite that have given a new twist to the basic physics of bloch bands : roughly speaking , the topology of insulating band structures measures the winding of the submanifold of occupied bands , represented by their projection @xmath8 , in the total space of all bands as a function of the lattice momentum @xmath9 .",

    "a non - vanishing monopole charge can be viewed as a fundamental obstruction to finding a global smooth gauge for the family of bloch functions @xcite . however , it is precisely this analytical structure of the bloch functions which determines the asymptotic decay of the associated wfs obtained by fourier transform ( cf .",

    "in contrast , in one spatial dimension , kohn could prove @xcite that exponentially localized wfs always exist .    for so called symmetry protected topological states @xcite , the situation is less simple .",
    "the topological nature of these band structures is rooted in the presence of a discrete symmetry , i.e. , they are topologically distinct from an atomic insulator only if these underlying symmetries are maintained . due to their vanishing chern numbers ,",
    "the existence of exponentially localized wfs is guaranteed for symmetry protected topological band structures .",
    "however , the possibility of representatives with even compactly supported wfs is unknown for many symmetry protected states .",
    "a conclusive understanding of this issue is of particular interest since compactly supported wfs imply the existence of exact flat - band models with finite range hopping @xcite and the possibility of dissipative analogs by virtue of local dissipation @xcite .    a remarkably widely adopted and practically very useful approach to maximally",

    "@xcite is to localize the wfs in real space by optimizing the gauge of the associated bloch functions in reciprocal space based on a gradient search algorithm .",
    "generically , this class of algorithms finds a local optimum that depends on the initial choice of gauge .",
    "very recently , a different paradigm for the construction of localized functions that approximately block - diagonalize a hamilton operator has been formulated @xcite .",
    "this approach is rooted in the theory of cs @xcite , a contemporary branch of research at the interface between signal processing and fundamental information theory @xcite , which has also found applications in quantum theory @xcite . in cs , the expected sparsity of a signal in some basis",
    "is employed for its exact reconstruction from significantly under - sampled measurement data , without having to make use of the exact sparsity pattern . to this end , the sparsity of the signal is optimized under the constraint that it be compatible with the incomplete measurement data at hand .",
    "translated to the spectral problem of a hamiltonian , the analog of the incomplete measurement data is the ambiguity in the choice of basis functions that span a subspace associated with a certain energy range . under the constraint of not involving basis states outside of this energy range , the sparsity of the basis functions in real space , i.e. , their localization , is then optimized .",

    "the linear tails demonstrate the asymptotic exponential decay .",
    "@xmath20 is chosen for both plots . ]",
    "we would now like to turn our attention to time reversal symmetric 2d insulators , in symmetry class aii @xcite .",
    "for states in symmetry class a with non - vanishing first chern number , so called chern insulators @xcite , only algebraically decaying wfs can be found . as a consequence , chern insulators with exponentially localized or even compactly supported",
    "wfs can not exist .",
    "however , the situation is less obvious for trs protected topological insulators , a.k.a .",
    "quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulators @xcite .",
    "the conceptually simplest representative of this topological equivalence class consists of two trs conjugated copies of a chern insulator with opposite odd chern number , one copy for each spin block ( cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "while the individual spin blocks have non - zero chern number , the total set of occupied bands has zero chern number as required by trs .",
    "hence , a smooth gauge mixing the two trs conjugated blocks can be found for the bloch functions @xcite .    here",
    "we would like to consider a minimal model for a qsh insulator analogous to the one introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite which has @xmath125 degrees of freedom per site and @xmath126 occupied bands .",

    "we denote the @xmath128 pseudo spin by @xmath129 and the real spin by @xmath130 .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian of the spin up block reads as @xmath131 the hamiltonian of the trs conjugated block is then defined by @xmath132 .",
    "this model is topologically nontrivial for @xmath133 and trivial for @xmath134 .",
    "the projection onto the occupied bands @xmath48 can for each @xmath9 be written as a sum of @xmath135 and @xmath136 a smooth gauge of bloch functions @xmath137 , @xmath138 , can be found in a generic way @xcite .",
    "one first chooses a set of trial orbitals @xmath139 , which are random linear combinations of the four basis orbitals . projecting onto the occupied bands yields @xmath140 .",
    "if the family of gram matrices with entries @xmath141 is regular for all @xmath9 , smooth bloch functions defined as @xmath142 can be obtained . in practice , by trying a few random choices , a gauge for which @xmath143 can be readily found .",
    "the associated wfs are then obtained by fourier transform . .",
    "we employ the above prescription to find exponentially decaying wfs both in the topologically trivial and nontrivial regime on a lattice of @xmath144 sites .",
    "these wfs are then used as starting points for the adiabatic continuity algorithm introduced in section [ sec : algtop ] .",
    "for wfs associated with topologically trivial insulators , i.e. , @xmath145 , our algorithm finds a set of atomic wfs representing the most localized topologically trivial insulator to impressive numerical accuracy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : movie2d ] ) .",
    "however , as soon as the initial set of wfs corresponds to a non - trivial qsh state , the algorithm does not find a compactly supported set of wfs .",
    "this result gives numerical evidence that a simple flat band model hamiltonian with finite range hopping does not exist for the qsh state in contrast to the 1d tsc .",
    "the relation between flat band models with finite range hopping and compact wfs becomes clear from the following representation of the projection @xmath48 onto the occupied bands at momentum @xmath9 in terms of wannier functions @xmath146 centered around the origin , @xmath147 an exact flat band hamiltonian where all occupied states have energy @xmath148 and all empty states have energy @xmath149 is then immediately obtained as @xmath150    to see if our findings are sensitive to the number of bands , we also applied the adiabatic continuity algorithm to a qsh model with 8 bands which did not yield qualitatively different results .",
    "the idea of dissipative state preparation @xcite in the context of topological states of matter @xcite relies , for pure and translation invariant target states , on the existence of a complete set of fermionic creation and annihilation operators @xmath151 forming a dirac algebra ( the indices referring to sites and bands , respectively ) . in this case , the stationary state of a dissipative evolution described by a lindblad master equation @xmath152 with damping rate @xmath153 , will be identical to the ground state of the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath154 with mutually commuting @xmath155 . in typical implementations of such a dissipative dynamics in the context of cold atomic systems , the lindblad operators @xmath156 generating the dissipative dynamics are quasi - local , i.e. have a compact support on the underlying lattice @xcite .",
    "our algorithm is precisely constructed to find such compactly supported operators @xmath156 , with the mutual commutativity of the associated @xmath155 being granted by the shift orthogonality of the wannier functions . unlike the one dimensional case of the topologically nontrivial ground state of kitaev s quantum wire , where a representative with compactly supported wannier functions exists and is indeed found by our algorithm , our results in two dimensions imply the absence of an analogous situation in two dimensions .",
    "in this work , we have presented a method to search for localized wannier functions of free quantum lattice models which explicitly takes into account the symmetry of the problem .",
    "most interestingly , we could extend the domain of this search algorithm from individual model hamiltonians to entire topological equivalence classes .",
    "this allows for a numerical detection of the most localized representative of a given topological state .",
    "we did so by elaborating on a compressed sensing approach built upon bregman split techniques , where the spatial locality takes the role of the sparsity of the problem ( see refs .",
    "we close our presentation by providing some perspectives opened up by our present analysis , including a few particularly intriguing implications and applications of our new algorithm      the possibility to identify localized wannier functions not only for given model hamiltonians , but also  if the energy functional is set to zero along with @xmath157  maximally localized wannier functions within entire topological equivalence classes opens up another interesting application of our work : that of a _ diagnostic tool _",
    ": whenever it converges , it identifies a `` sweet spot '' characterizing the topological class of the initial hamiltonian itself rather than minimizing the energy of a certain model .",
    "the flow towards the atomic insulator and the topological flat band ( kitaev ) superconductor , starting from generic states within the same topological phase provide striking examples of this .",
    "but the parameter @xmath42 can be freely chosen , reflecting the @xmath37-regularization in terms of compressed sensing .",
    "this freedom gives rise to a useful `` knob '' to tune , and for applications in the context of e.g. , ab initio band structure calculations , a finite @xmath45 is more appropriate .",
    "thinking further about our algorithm as a flow in the renormalization group sense is likely to be fruitful also in the context of interacting as well as disordered systems .",
    "in fact our protocol bears some ( non - accidental ) resemblance with tensor network algorithms ( quantum state renormalization methods ) such as dmrg and tebd in one dimension and peps and mera more generally @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it seems that in order to simulate weakly interacting ( and/or disordered ) fermionic lattice models , the efficiently localized wannier functions which are still orthogonal appear to be a very suitable starting point for devising variational sets of states , as real space operators remain short ranged ( and close to diagonal ) when projected to the pertinent electronic band .",
    "most saliently , tensor network approaches augmented with an initial preferred basis selection based on our algorithm appear particularly promising in two - dimensional approaches , where having a low bond dimension in peps approaches is critical for the highly costly ( approximate ) tensor network contraction .",
    "more specifically , two approaches seem interesting : in a first , one takes a weakly interacting model and re - expresses the non - interacting part in the wannier basis found by the algorithm .",
    "if the wannier functions are exactly localized , then the new hamiltonian will still be local .",
    "this an ansatz for a tensor network approach including interactions . in a second , one starts from a generalized mean field approach for the interacting model , generates wannier functions and then applies a variational tensor network method .",
    "finally , a fundamental question arises due to the apparent lack of wannier functions for the quantum spin hall phase , namely that of the importance of exponentially decaying tails .",
    "we have found that any truncation of the tail of the wannier functions inevitably leads to the breaking of time - reversal symmetry at a corresponding rate .",
    "in fact , cutting exponential tails seems continuous , but the qsh phase can be left continuously by breaking trs . despite being a conceptual problem it may not be a practical one . in any solid - state realization of a finite size qsh insulator , there will be weak trs breaking terms , yet the physical response can  at least in principle ",
    "be experimentally indistinguishable from that of a truly trs invariant system . in this sense , even though the wannier functions with compact support and formally do not represent a qsh phase , they may still be used for practical purposes .",
    "our algorithm provides a tool to systematically assess these questions . yet",
    "these are merely a few of many intriguing directions , and we anticipate that our findings will inspire future research in diverse branches of physics , as well as in applied mathematics . +",
