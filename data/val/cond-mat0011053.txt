    "the nature of the low - lying excitations in the mixed state of a @xmath0-wave superconductor is both an interesting quantum mechanics problem and important for understanding the behavior of high temperature superconductors in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "volovik@xcite first studied this problem in the semiclassical limit , where the @xmath0-wave quasiparticles are doppler shifted by the local superfluid density .",
    "the shifting of quasiparticle energies results in a non - zero density of states at zero energy proportional to the square root of the magnetic field .",
    "volovik s solution has been applied to calculations of the specific heat@xcite thermal conductivity@xcite , and nuclear magnetic relaxation rates@xcite .",
    "it has motivated useful discussions of the scaling behavior of the specific heat by simon and lee@xcite , kopnin and volovik@xcite , and others .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field and its associated vortex lattice affects the motion of quasiparticles in four distinct ways .",
    "first , the quasiparticles , which carry current , move in the magnetic field which is approximately uniform for an extreme type - ii superconductor .",
    "second , although the field is approximately uniform , it is not exactly so , and therefore the quasiparticles experience magnetic field gradients .",
    "however the direct effect of these gradients is rather small .",
    "third , there are supercurrents associated with the curl of the field , and the quasiparticle energies are affected by the corresponding superfluid velocity through which they move . for a uniform superfluid velocity field",
    ", the effect would be a simple doppler shift of the energies .",
    "however , for inhomogeneous superfluid velocities the problem is more complicated .",
    "fourth and finally , the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter is inhomogeneous in the mixed state , although this is mainly apparent within a coherence length of each vortex core where this magnitude falls to zero . for an extreme type - ii superconductor ,",
    "this represents a very small fraction of the sample for fields well below @xmath1 .",
    "volovik s approach neglects the magnetic field and its gradients as well as the inhomogeneous order parameter amplitude and focuses only on the local supercurrent velocity .",
    "it assumes that the quasiparticle wave function can be thought of as a wave packet which is localized in a region over which the magnitude and direction of the superfluid velocity are relatively uniform .",
    "the energy of a low - lying , @xmath0-wave quasiparticle depends linearly on @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wave vector of the nearest node . if a quasiparticle is localized in a region of size smaller than @xmath4 ,",
    "then the spread in its energy will be larger than its average energy and the wavepacket picture does not work . for the superfluid velocity to be relatively uniform in a region ,",
    "the size of the region must be smaller than the distance to the nearest vortex core and certainly smaller than , @xmath0 , the distance between vortices .",
    "let us apply the above considerations to the lowest energy quasiparticle band .",
    "this corresponds to a quasiparticle , near node @xmath5 , with wave vector @xmath6 perpendicular to @xmath7 localized in a region of size @xmath8 . for the wavepacket picture to apply",
    ", the energy , @xmath9 , of the quasiparticle must be greater than @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the quasiparticle velocity along @xmath6 .",
    "however for the superfluid velocity to be uniform in the region of size @xmath8 it is necessary that @xmath12 . combining these two conditions",
    "we obtain the requirement that @xmath13 . for energies less than this",

    "this energy range is readily accessible via specific heat measurements below @xmath14k in fields of one to several tesla .",
    "it is this energy region that is the main focus of this paper .",
    "recently , franz and tesanovi@xcite ( ft ) have derived a quantum mechanical theory of the mixed state of a @xmath0-wave superconductor , which involves a singular gauge transformation that maps the original problem of superconducting quasiparticles in a magnetic field onto an equivalent one of quasiparticles in a periodic potential .",
    "the latter problem may be solved using conventional band - structure methods .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the low - energy properties of a @xmath0-wave superconductor in the mixed state using the theory derived by franz and tesanovi@xcite .",
    "the most direct experimental probes of these properties are the low - energy tunneling density of states and the low temperature specific heat . in order to calculate these quantities reliably",
    ", we have investigated the numerical problem of dirac quasiparticles in the periodic potential of the vortex lattice , focusing on the simplifications that result from the fact that the anisotropy of the dirac cones , @xmath15 .",
    "as discussed by melnikov@xcite , such large anisotropy makes the problem approximately one - dimensional .",
    "melnikov described how to obtain solutions to the one - dimensional problem , but he then confined his analysis to the semiclassical versions of these solutions .",
    "we have explicitly evaluated the quantum mechanical solutions in this one - dimensional limit and used them as a test of the accuracy of approximate plane - wave solutions .",
    "we then show how to improve on the one - dimensional solutions by including a small number of plane wave basis states for the transverse direction , and we study the convergence of this approach .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii addresses the computational problem of calculating quasiparticle energies in the lowest bands in the magnetic brillouin zone , comparing exact and plane - wave - expansion solutions for the simplified one - dimensional problem and then comparing 1-d and 2-d plane - wave expansion solutions for various choices of plane - waves .",
    "section iii presents results for the local tunneling density of states , sec.iv re - interprets recent muon spin resonance measurements of the vortex core size in terms of a scaling picture , and sec .",
    "v presents calculations of the low temperature specific heat , comparing them to predictions based on volovik s approach and to experimental data .",

    "the gauge invariant form of the gap operator , @xmath20 , for a @xmath0-wave superconductor can be written as ( see ref . for the details ) @xmath21 where , for notational convenience , we have chosen to orient our axes along the directions of the gap nodes , at an angle of @xmath22 with respect to the orientation of the cuo@xmath23  planes .",

    "@xmath62 the momentum parallel to the fermi surface @xmath63 will be much larger than that along the nodal direction .",
    "the quasiparticle wavefunction will thus be localized in the direction parallel to the fermi surface , but will be extended and will feel the average effect of the superfluid velocity fields of several vortices along the nodal direction .",
    "since the potential @xmath64 is periodic we can expand the quasiparticle wavefunction in the plane - wave basis : @xmath65 the periodic potential of the vortex lattice will be responsible for the interaction of the fourier components @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "if we are interested only in energies below a cutoff energy , @xmath68 , for which the momentum @xmath59 lies well within the first mbz we can make the approximation that the quasiparticle wavefunction is one - dimensional and ignore the interaction of those fourier components that are at different values of @xmath69 .",

    "their interaction is consequently negligible , and we can assume that the hamiltonian is diagonal in the quantum number @xmath77 .",

    "the 1-d spectra show good qualitative agreement with the 2-d spectra , capturing the major features of the lowest bands , including the line quasinodes that form at large values of @xmath62 . however , the 1-d treatment is unable to accurately represent , _ quantitatively _ , the behavior of the full 2-d spectrum . in particular , as can be seen from figs .",

    "unfortunately , the slow convergence of the 2-d reciprocal lattice sums  due to the divergence of the superfluid velocity at the vortex cores ( discussed in more detail by vafek _ _ et al.__@xcite)makes it very difficult to accurately determine the size of these minigaps in the full 2-d calculation .    nonetheless , we believe that the 1-d treatment ( which is far less computationally intensive than the 2-d problem ) captures and elucidates the important physics of the lowest bands of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum and is therefore a useful tool that helps us understand the physical behavior of the quasiparticles in the mixed state . in particular we will use the 1-d energies and wave functions to calculate the local tunneling density of states and the specific heat .",
    "next we compare the results of the 1-d calculations to finite 2-d plane wave expansions using a grid of @xmath123 reciprocal lattice vectors .",

    "similar results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv20 ] for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "one of the most striking features of both figures is the complete insensitivity of the linear branch near the @xmath114 point to the number of plane - waves in the calculation . for this branch",
    ", it appears that the 1-d energies are essentially exact . for other low - energy branches and general points in the brillouin zone , the plane - wave expansion seems to converge smoothly .",
    "the only pathological behavior occurs near the quasinodes , where both the positions and the values of the minima converge slowly .",
    "in this section we show results of calculations of the local tunneling density of states ( tdos ) of the quasiparticles in the lowest band of the energy spectrum using the one - dimensional plane - wave expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bloch1d ] ) .",
    "the tdos is:@xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the derivative of the fermi function , @xmath131 is the set of wave vectors in the magnetic brillouin zone , @xmath132 is the set of energy bands ( restricted in this case to the lowest positive and negative energy bands ) and @xmath5 is the set of four dirac nodes .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath133 is equal to the number of spins divided by the number of wave vectors in the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "the extra factor of 2 is an artifact of the normalization in the diagonalization routine used .",
    "the plane - wave expansion was done at the node @xmath134 .",
    "it is easy to show that by taking @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ldos ] ) one obtains the contribution from the opposite node at @xmath136 . within the 1-d approximation , these two nodes give the _ y _ dependence of the tdos , and the other two nodes at @xmath137 give the _ x _ dependence .",
    "the _ y _ ( or _ x _ ) dependence of the tdos at 1 kelvin and at a field of 1 tesla , for two different values of the anisotropy @xmath62 , and at three different energies is shown in figs .  [ fig : ldos14 ] and [ fig : ldos20 ] .",
    "one can see that the tdos has the periodicity of , and is sharply peaked at , the vortex lines .",
    "the tdos falls to a broad minimum in the regions between the vortices .",
    "the shoulders on either side of the peaks come from the states within the lines of quasinodes that form at large values of @xmath62 . at @xmath127 , the size of the gap in the line quasinode has decreased and a second line quasinode has started to appear ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d2d20 ] ) .",
    "both these features contribute to the very distinct shoulders on either side of the peak in the tdos in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos20 ] .    figure [ fig : ldos2d ] shows the zero - bias two - dimensional tdos as a sum over the four nodes .",

    "the vortex lattice geometry of our paper is , in melnikov s notation , a type ii lattice with @xmath138 .",
    "this gives a tdos that is proportional to @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "the semiclassical tdos of melnikov thus has the profile of a triangle wave along the _ x _ and _ y _ directions .",
    "the fully quantum mechanical results shown here follow this profile , but exhibit additional structure that arises from the quasiparticle states near the quasinodes .",
    "we note that only half of the bright spots in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos2d ] lies at vortex positions while the other half lies halfway between vortices .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos2d ] the bright spots at the corners and at the center of the figure might correspond to vortex sites .",
    "the other bright spots are then the result of the overlap of the sharply peaked tunneling density of states which extends from each vortex , parallel to the four node directions .",
    "it is an artifact of the 1-d model that , for the case of a square lattice , these overlaps have a peak tunneling density of states equal to that of a vortex core .",
    "this artifact is less evident in more general , centered rectangular lattices or , in particular , for the hexagonal lattice.@xcite",
    "two important simplifying assumptions in this model are that the superconducting coherence length is negligible and that the penetration depth is large compared to the distance between vortices . as a consequence of these assumptions ,",
    "the intervortex spacing is the only length scale in the problem .",
    "this allows us to present results scaled to this length as is done above for the tunneling density of states .",
    "in addition to the tunneling density of states , one could also use the wave functions generated by these calculations to compute the pattern of the two - dimensional supercurrent density .",
    "this would , of course , not be a self - consistent result , but it would be an improvement over the initial form for the supercurrent density corresponding to eq .",
    "( 7 ) . without actually doing this calculation ,",
    "we know that the resulting pattern would be a function of @xmath141 and hence that all lengths would scale as @xmath142 .",
    "this picture , in which the vortex lattice constant provides the only length scale , is supported by the self - consistent calculations of franz and tesanovic for a single @xmath0-wave vortex .",
    "@xcite in fig . 1 of ref .   and the accompanying discussion",
    ", it is shown that , for systems with very short coherence lengths , the spatial dependence of the gap function outside the core has a scale - independent power - law dependence , approaching its asymptotic value roughly as @xmath143 .",
    "the above discussion provides a natural explanation of the muon spin resonance results of sonier and co - workers@xcite who found that the vortex core radius , defined as the radius at which the supercurrent density has its maximum , grows large at low field .",

    "the large peak both sharpens and moves closer to the @xmath190 axis as the anisotropy @xmath62 is increased .",

    "a narrow peak at @xmath9 in the dos will typically show up as a peak in the specific heat near @xmath192.@xcite comparing the 1-d and 2-d dispersions and dos , we expect this peak to shift to slightly lower energy and to sharpen in the full 2-d calculation of the specific heat .    the sc specific heat , for the square lattice and for the single - vortex approximation , is shown in fig .",

    "et al._@xcite .",

    "et al._,@xcite the vortex contribution to the specific heat was obtained by subtracting @xmath205 from @xmath206 , the idea being that both lattice and magnetic impurity effects would cancel out in this subtraction and that the vortex contribution to the spceific heat for @xmath207 is small . in the more recent preprint by wang _",
    "et al._@xcite , results are presented for @xmath208 for @xmath209 . for our purposes , these data are more directly useful since they involve only the single field direction that we have studied .",

    "et al._,@xcite we need to subtract the specific heat in zero field from that in a field .",
    "the result is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaledcovert ] .",
    "it is interesting that the structure that we find at the lowest temperatures could easily be attributed to schottky - type anomalies in the data .",
    "in fact wang _",
    "_ @xcite show figures with and without subtraction of an assumed schottky anomoly , and the latter better resembles our theoretical results .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that the experimentally observed low temperature structure in samples with the least magnetic impurities is actually due to the structure in the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "however , since the magnitude of the observed field - dependent specific heat is more than twice as large as the calculated value , such detailed comparisons between theory and experiment are probably premature .",
    "the effect of disorder on the quasiparticles would likely increase the low energy specific heat , since it increases the low energy dos . on the other hand , disorder in the vortex lattice",
    "may equally well decrease the low - energy specific heat by reducing the local supercurrent velocity .",
    "therefore , it is not obvious that disorder , in itself , can account for the differences between theory and experiment .",
    "by making the approximation , in the mixed state , that the low - energy quasiparticle states in the dirac nodes are essentially one - dimensional , we have been able to obtain analytical results for the quasiparticle wave functions and energy spectra .",
    "the 1-d approximation to the ft hamiltonian@xcite elucidates the physics of the interaction of the quasiparticles in the lowest - energy bands with the vortex lattice : the quasiparticles travel as plane - waves along the directions of the gap nodes , and are confined by the periodic potential of the vortex lattice in the direction of the fermi surface . using these exact analytical results",
    ", we were able to show that the approximate plane - wave solution for the same problem converges rapidly .",
    "the 1-d approximation is able to reproduce the important features of the 2-d plane - wave expansion in the lowest bands .",
    "we have presented calculations of the tunneling density of states , which are in qualitative agreement with the semiclassical results of melnikov@xcite but which also show spatial structure due to the energy dispersion of the low - lying states .",
    "the density of states at zero energy for the quantum problem is significantly lower ( by a factor of 2 ) than the commonly - employed semiclassical result for a single circular vortex , although this simple approximation overestimates the semiclassical density of states for a square vortex lattice configuration by roughly 30% at zero energy .",
    "thus this reduction arises from two sources : the larger area of low superfluid velocity in the abrikosov lattice , compared to the case of a single vortex in a circular unit cell of radius @xmath8 , and quantum averaging of the superfluid velocity for quasiparticles in the first magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "the specific heat has been calculated from the dos of the 1-d plane - wave expansion and found to exhibit structure at low temperatures that is not present in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the low- temperature specific heat is reduced by quantum effects .",
    "since the values of the specific heat measured experimentally,@xcite for parameters @xmath50 and @xmath11 taken from other experiments , are already larger than the semiclassical results , the disagreement in magnitude with the quantum results are even larger .",
    "one possibility is that the discrepancy is due to the effects of disorder which , to date , have not been included in any quantum treatment of the specific heat .",
    "other possibilities are that the parameters are such that @xmath62 is substantially larger than is currently believed , or that there are additional low - energy states not accounted for in the disordered @xmath0-wave model but which exhibit similar magnetic - field dependence .",
