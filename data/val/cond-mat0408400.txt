    "electronic raman scattering has long been used as a direct probe of the charge excitations of different materials .",
    "experiments have shown a number of interesting phenomena , especially in correlated materials .",
    "a material independence for raman scattering has been seen in a number of different correlation gap ( insulating ) materials ranging from fesi@xcite , to smb@xmath2@xcite , to ca@xmath3ru@xmath4o@xmath5@xcite to high temperature superconductors@xcite the raman response shows a gap opening at low temperature , but with the gap about ten times larger than the onset temperature where the gap starts to form .",
    "in addition , an isosbestic point is often seen , where the raman response at one value of frequency is independent of temperature ( at low temperature ) , and curves for different temperatures appear to cross at a single point .",
    "resonant effects are even more interesting , as it is believed that the resonance can cause an enhancement of the nonresonant signal by orders of magnitude , and allow small signals to become observable .",
    "what remains unknown is whether these resonant enhancements dramatically change the shape of the underlying nonresonant response .",
    "the theoretical description of electronic raman scattering has lagged behind experiment .",
    "recently , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has been employed to calculate the nonresonant response in the falicov - kimball@xcite and hubbard models@xcite and to examine inelastic x - ray scattering as well@xcite .",
    "it was found that the theoretical calculations of the nonresonant response show much of the behavior seen in experiment , including the large gap relative to the onset temperature and the generic appearance of an easily observed isosbestic point in the @xmath6 channel .    however , it is well known that many of the raman signals in correlated metals and insulators display complicated dependences on the incoming photon frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the resonant behavior of the @xmath8 two - magnon feature at roughly @xmath9  mev has been well studied in the parent insulating cuprates la@xmath4cuo@xmath10 , yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath11 , and sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4@xcite , where a resonance is found for incident photon energies near 3  ev . although recent progress has been made@xcite , the reason for this resonance is not clear since the resonance frequency lies above the optical absorption edge frequency measured in the dielectric response@xcite , and the photon energy is much larger than the location of the resonance peak in the response function .",
    "the general question of how the low - energy features ( such as particle - hole excitations near the fermi level ) and high - energy ( such as charge - transfer excitations ) change under resonant conditions remains relatively unexplored .",
    "most treatments for raman scattering in insulators have focused on only the spin degrees of freedom ( heisenberg limit ) in two dimensions . for the case",
    "when the incident photon energy is much less than the optical band gap , the loudon - fleury theory@xcite has been widely employed to determine resonance profiles from spin degrees of freedom via series expansions@xcite , exact diagonalization of small clusters@xcite or quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite of the heisenberg model .",
    "modifications due to quantum fluctuations@xcite , bilayers@xcite , four - magnon processes@xcite , couplings beyond nearest neighbor exchange@xcite , and ring exchange@xcite have all been taken into account to give a thorough treatment of two magnon scattering from spin degrees of freedom in the nonresonant regime .",
    "these approaches fail when the laser frequency is tuned to lie near an optical transition . in this regime , based on a spin - density - wave approach , frenkel , chubukov , and morr have formulated a so called `` triple - resonance '' theory from which important features of the spectra can be derived@xcite . while good agreement was obtained for the resonant profile of the two magnon contribution to light scattering@xcite , general features not related to the two - magnon peak are missed and lineshape calculations are complex and only semiquantitative .",
    "an approach treating the full fermionic degrees of freedom is still lacking .",
    "recently exact diagonalization studies of the hubbard model have been employed to yield lineshapes in the resonant limit from both spin and charge degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "yet the nonresonant and mixed terms were not taken into account .",
    "these calculations also suffer the problems related to the finite size of the clusters ( such as artificially broadening the delta functions to approximate thermodynamic - limit spectra ) .",
    "so generally , there is no theory for raman scattering from both charge and spin degrees of freedom which predicts spectral lineshapes where both resonant , mixed , and nonresonant terms are treated on an equal footing and do not suffer from finite - size effects .    in this contribution",
    "we illustrate how to calculate the full electronic raman response function , including contributions from the nonresonant , mixed , and resonant processes within a single - band model .",
    "our model includes interactions of the photon with all charge excitations of a correlated fermionic system , but does not take into account any scattering off of spin excitations . the scattering response is a complicated function of the correlations , the temperature , the incident photon energy , and the transfered energy .",
    "a short communication of this work has already appeared@xcite .",
    "little is known about what the mixed raman response looks like .",
    "we find that , as opposed to the nonresonant and resonant responses , which are manifestly positive , the mixed response is often negative ( although the total response always remains positive ) .",
    "the resonant response is expected to be large in the region where the transfered energy approaches the incident photon energy , called the double resonance , because the energy denominators of two pairs of the green s functions in the bare response function approach zero .",
    "interesting results are also anticipated in the strongly coupled ( mott - insulating ) regime , when the incident photon energy is close to the interaction energy .",
    "indeed , we find this is the case here .",
    "we also examine the situation where the initial photon energy is larger than the excitation energies in the correlated band .",
    "this is the most common experimental situation in correlated materials with renormalized low - energy `` bands '' .",
    "the mixed and resonant responses also behave differently than the nonresonant response when we compare the stokes ( energy transfered from the photon to the electrons ) and the anti - stokes ( energy transfered from the electrons to the photons ) responses .",
    "these are equal for nonresonant scattering , but the anti - stokes response is much smaller than the stokes response for the mixed and resonant scattering cases ( introducing an asymmetry to the raman scattering ) .",
    "the theoretical challenge in calculating the full inelastic light scattering response function is that the mixed diagrams involve three - particle susceptibilities and the resonant diagrams involve four - particle susceptibilities .",
    "it is only in the infinite - dimensional limit , where most of the many - particle vertex renormalizations vanish ( all three - particle and four - particle vertices do not contribute ; only the two - particle vertices enter ) , can one imagine performing the calculation of these susceptibilities exactly .",
    "it turns out that because the two - particle irreducible charge vertex is known exactly for the falicov - kimball model@xcite , one can calculate the full raman response function in this case ( since the general form of the charge vertex is not known for the hubbard model , one can only perform approximate calculations for that system even in infinite dimensions ; nevertheless , the diagrammatic analysis given in section iii holds for the hubbard model , we just are not able to evaluate the expressions ) .",
    "we evaluate our exact expressions numerically and study their evolution as functions of the incident light energy and of the transfered energy . in the case of a correlated metal ,",
    "we show how fermi - liquid - like features evolve as the lifetime of putative quasiparticles decreases due to scattering .",
    "the results are even more interesting in the correlated insulator .",
    "we examine what happens to the isosbestic point identified in the nonresonant response , and how the presence of the charge gap affects the optical scattering .",
    "inelastic light scattering involves a coupling of photons to electronic charge excitations of the correlated material .",
    "the symmetry of the incident and scattered light relates to the symmetry of the charge excitations that are coupled to the light .",
    "there are typically three symmetries examined in experiments .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry has the full symmetry of the lattice .",
    "this is measured , in a system with only nearest - neighbor hopping , by polarizing the incident and scattered light along the diagonal direction of the hypercubic lattice , so in large dimensions , we take the initial and final polarizations to be @xmath12 . the @xmath13 symmetry is a @xmath14-wave - like symmetry that involves crossed polarizers along the diagonals .",
    "we take @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the @xmath13 channel .",
    "finally , the @xmath1 symmetry is another @xmath14-wave symmetry rotated by 45 degrees ; it requires the polarizations to satisfy @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath0 sector has contributions from nonresonant , mixed , and resonant raman scattering , the @xmath13 sector has contributions from nonresonant and resonant raman scattering only , and the @xmath1 sector is purely resonant .",
    "this is generally true for a model on a bipartite lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping only .",
    "if longer - range hoppings are allowed , then all channels will have nonresonant , mixed and resonant contributions .",
    "while our approach towards analytic continuation is general , the overall complexity of the problem limits our evaluation of the light scattering cross section . by focusing on the spinless falicov - kimball model",
    ", we present a theory of light scattering from charge degrees of freedom only ; valid for any incoming photon frequency .",
    "however , we are not able to address scattering from spin degrees of freedom resulting in two - magnon raman scattering , for example .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that our results help frame the physics related to resonance phenomena in paramagnetic correlated metals and insulators , and the behavior near a metal - insulator transition .",
    "our plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the general analytic - continuation formula that carries one from a time - ordered correlation function on the imaginary axis to the real response function .",
    "the formulas are completely general , and hold for the case of inelastic scattering of x - rays as well .",
    "the challenge is in evaluating the corresponding response functions along the real axis , which we know how to do only for the falicov - kimball model in infinite dimensions . in sec .",
    "iii , we evaluate the raman scattering for the falicov - kimball model explicitly , calculating all response functions , and showing in detail how to perform all of the relevant renormalizations of the two- , three- , and four - particle correlation functions . in sec .",
    "iv , we present our numerical results for raman scattering at half filling . we examine the metallic case , the insulating case , and study the evolution of the raman response as a function of the incident photon energy .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec . v.",
    "our starting point is the expression for the inelastic light scattering cross section derived by shastry and shraiman@xcite    @xmath19    for the scattering of electrons by photons of arbitrary wavelength ( the repeated indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 are summed over ) . here",

    "lastly , @xmath30 is the partition function . for an electronic system with nearest - neighbor hopping ,",
    "the interaction with a weak external transverse electromagnetic field @xmath31 is described by the following interacting hamiltonian @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the current operator and fermi velocity , respectively , and @xmath34 is the so - called stress tensor . as a result , the scattering operator @xmath35 has both nonresonant and resonant contributions @xmath36 with the sum @xmath37 over intermediate states .",
    "the term with the stress tensor is the nonresonant contribution , while the term with the square of the current operator is the resonant contribution .",
    "now the raman - scattering cross section contains nonresonant , mixed , and resonant contributions ( because it is constructed from the square of the scattering operator ) : @xmath38 where the nonresonant contribution is @xmath39 the mixed contribution is @xmath40      \\\\",

    "( [ raman_n][raman_r ] ) are not easy to calculate for an interacting system , so the summations are problematic to evaluate . instead",
    ", these expressions usually are evaluated via green s function techniques starting from correlation functions evaluated on the imaginary axis and then performing an analytic continuation to the real axis to get the physical response functions .",
    "this procedure becomes more complicated when the number of matrix elements that enter into each term in the summations increases , because it requires the evaluation of a more complicated correlation function on the imaginary axis .",
    "our strategy is to first consider the analytic continuation procedure in a general sense , which holds for any model hamiltonian and for arbitrary momentum transfer",
    ". we will derive connection formulas between the matsubara frequency axis correlation functions and the analytically continued response functions on the real axis .",
    "but those expressions will require us to be able to evaluate a number of different susceptibilities , and those expressions are not known for arbitrary hamiltonians .",

    "the joint resonance peak is a single smooth peak , while in the @xmath13 and @xmath1 channels , the joint resonance peak seems to have a double - peak structure to it .",
    "as the temperature is reduced , the resonant effects remain , but the spectral weight in the low - energy peak gets suppressed to very small values ( the @xmath217 curves are indistinguishable from the horizontal axis because they are at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath228 curves ) .",
    "the evolution of the resonant profile for other values of transferred frequency @xmath239 is complex and can be found in ref .   for @xmath214 .",
    "low - energy isosbestic behavior of the resonant raman response for @xmath214 and @xmath240 .",
    "the different thicknesses correspond to different temperatures , with thicker curves corresponding to lower temperatures ( four curves are plotted for @xmath241 , 0.5 , 0.2 , and 0.05 ) .",
    "note how the curves all cross at an isosbestic point , just slightly smaller than @xmath242 . ]",
    "the low - energy isosbestic behavior ( which means that the raman response is independent of temperature at a characteristic frequency ) is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : iso_u=3 ] .",
    "we choose @xmath240 because it corresponds to the maximal joint resonance effect for both the charge - transfer and low - energy peaks .",
    "we find that the low - energy isosbestic behavior is generic for the resonant raman scattering , with the response curves crossing at @xmath243 for all symmetries .",
    "hence , the low - energy isosbestic behavior seen in the nonresonant response ( which was most apparent in the @xmath13 channel , but can also be seen in the @xmath0 channel when the response is plotted on a logarithmic scale@xcite ) , survives in the resonant cases as well , and this helps explain why it is seen in so many experimental systems .",
    "in addition to the low - energy isosbestic point shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : iso_u=3 ] at @xmath244 , there is a second isosbestic point@xcite that appear near the double resonance @xmath245 . starting from large @xmath205 ( @xmath246 ) , as @xmath205 is reduced , the two isosbestic points move closer to each other , eventually joining together and disappearing when @xmath247 .",
    "so the isosbestic behavior will not be seen if the incident photon frequency is too low .",
    "with the use of dmft , we solved for the full raman response for all frequencies of incoming light in the falicov - kimball model .",
    "since the falicov - kimball model can be tuned across a metal - insulator transition , we have determined the form of raman scattering in both the metallic and insulating states , and have investigated light scattering on both sides of the quantum critical point at @xmath208 .",
    "resonant , non - resonant , and mixed contributions have all been treated on an equal footing and we allowed for an analysis of the dependence of raman scattering with temperature , interactions , and different light polarizations .",
    "our results confirm a number of previously held beliefs .",
    "first , we find a strong resonant enhancement of the charge - transfer peak in raman scattering when the incident photon energy lies near the charge - transfer energy .",
    "this behavior is robust to temperature and polarization changes due to the local nature of the charge - transfer excitation in our model .",
    "second , we also find a polarization - independent `` double - resonance '' enhancement when the transfered frequency of the light approaches the incident light frequency .",
    "this feature survives in the insulating phase because of the pseudogap nature of the insulator on the hypercubic lattice .",
    "in addition , we find a number of new features of light scattering in correlated insulators .",
    "we find that low energy spectral features , related to thermal populations of elementary excitations , show resonance behavior when the incident light is tuned to the much higher frequency of the charge - transfer energy .",
    "this is a specific case where the correlations are crucial , since in uncorrelated materials , this would correspond to off - resonant conditions . yet due to the many - body nature of the correlated band , spectral features well separated from the charge transfer peak have a non - trivial resonance profile .",
    "we believe that these may be potentially useful to understand the complex nature of charge excitations in correlated materials as it would impact both electronic and phononic raman scattering at low frequencies . finally , we find that the presence of an isosbestic point in the raman response for correlated insulators results from a symmetry - dependent combination of all resonant , mixed , and non - resonant terms , and appears to be generic .",
    "we close with a discussion of open questions concerning improvements to the theory . here",
    "we have restricted ourselves to raman scattering in a correlated band of electrons in the limit of large spatial dimensions .",
    "performing calculations in physical dimensions requires more many - particle charge vertex renormalizations which makes the problem extremely difficult , though possible in principle .",
    "but we found that most vertex renormalizations were rather mild , so including nonlocal effects into the vertices ( finite dimensions ) probably does not change these results dramatically ( unless the vertex can diverge in finite dimensions ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath248-dependent information would prove to be useful for investigating dispersive many - particle excitations , as probed in inelastic x - ray scattering .",
    "these are topics of future interest .",
