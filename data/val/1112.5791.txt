    "nonlinear dynamics is a topic that not only cover all the disciplines , in both natural and social sciences , but also is now becoming part of introductory level undergraduate courses in sciences . searching for affordable , easy to setup , and reconfigurable classroom demonstrations that allow to investigate the physical and mathematical nature of nonlinear dynamical systems has been always a matter of interest for instructors .",
    "this paper describes a simple apparatus used to explore the behavior of one - dimensional chaotic maps , like the logistic map , when different initial conditions are chosen .",
    "the device consists of an inexpensive open - source microcontroller connected to an array of light emitting diodes ( leds ) , and programmed to iterate the logistic map in the one - dimensional interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this interval is divided in ten equal parts and mapped one - to - one to a single led in the array .",
    "when the logistic map produces certain value after an iteration , the corresponding led lights up showing the value in the one dimensional domain approximately .",
    "after several iterations , it is possible to _ visualize _ the trajectory of the map by looking at the blinking leds sequence .",
    "sensitivity to initial conditions , density of periodic orbits , strange attractors , and bifurcations are visualized easily with this device .",
    "the logistic map is , perhaps , the simplest example of how a nonlinear dynamical equation can give rise to very complex , chaotic behavior .",
    "@xcite initially introduced as a mathematical model of population growth ,  @xcite it rapidly found applications in diverse areas like mathematical biology , biometry , demography , condense matter , econophysics , and computation .",
    "@xcite the logistic map function is defined as @xmath1 where the factor @xmath2 is a model - dependent parameter representing _ external _ conditions to the system , and @xmath3 is the population in the @xmath4th - period cycle , scaled so that its value fits in the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "@xcite the function @xmath5 is called an _ iteration function _ because we may find the population fraction @xmath6 in the following period cycle by repeating the mathematical operations expressed in .",
    "@xcite it is also one - dimensional since there is only a single variable @xmath6 , and the resulting curve is a line .",

    "listing  [ list01 ] shows a simple program ( sketch ) used to operate the microcontroller , and _ visualize _ the logistic map by looking at the array of blinking leds .",
    "a glowing led represents an iteration of the one - dimensional map , and it is linked with a value in the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "arduino programs require two mandatory functions : ` setup ( ) ` and ` loop ( ) ` .",
    "any variable or constant defined outside these two functions is considered to be _",
    "global_. in the ` setup ( ) ` function , we tell the microcontroller that there are 10 leds connected to the digital pins and that they are intended to be turned on and off . in the ` loop ( ) ` function , the logistic map is iterated , and the visualization process takes place as we observe the leds turning on and off , one after another , following the evolution of the nonlinear system .    using the ` if ( ) ` and ` else ` control structures , we divide the interval @xmath0 $ ] in ten identical segments and associate an led to each one of them .",
    "for example , the first led from the left represents the first interval segment @xmath10 , the second led represents the segment @xmath11 , and so on .",
    "the last led represents the final segment @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "when the microcontroller iterates the logistic map , a value belonging to one of these ten intervals is returned , and the corresponding led turns on for 500 milliseconds .",

    "the initial conditions for the logistic map can be changed anytime and uploaded again into the microcontroller .",
    "thus , we can explore the behavior of the chaotic map when different values of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath13 are chosen .",
    "it is amusing to study the bifurcations of the logistic map by looking at the blinking sequence of leds .",

    "the led associated with the interval @xmath21 turns on first .",
    "as the iterations of the logistic map take place , we observe that the sequence of blinking leds moves toward the very first led , which is associated with the segment @xmath10 .",
    "the sequence ends up with this first led left on indefinitely .",

    "repeller_. figure  [ fig03](c ) shows the periodic behavior of the logistic map for this set of parameters .",
    "unfortunately , higher periodicity ( like 4-period , 8-period cycles , or higher ) can not be observed clearly with this device because of the way the leds are mapped into the @xmath0 $ ] interval .",
    "more leds are required to improve the `` resolution '' of the device",
    ". however , the microcontroller has a limit of 13 digital pins , and other electric components ( like an extra microchip ) need to be incorporated into the circuit if we want more leds controlled by the device .    finally , when @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , chaos onsets.@xcite an `` apparently '' randomness of blinking leds is observed .",
