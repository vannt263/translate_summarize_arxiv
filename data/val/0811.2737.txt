    "the modeling of interactions between ultrasonic waves and cracks is of great interest in many fields of applied mechanics . when the wavelengths are much larger than the width of the cracks , the latter are usually replaced by zero - thickness interfaces with appropriate jump conditions .",
    "linear models for crack - face interactions have been widely developed @xcite .",
    "however , these models do not prevent the non - physical penetration of crack faces .",
    "in addition , laboratory experiments have shown that ultrasonic methods based on linear models often fail to detect partially closed cracks @xcite .",
    "a well - known nonlinear model for cracks is the unilateral contact model @xcite .",
    "a more realistic hyperbolic model accounting for the finite compressibility of crack faces under normal loading conditions has been presented for applications in engineering @xcite and geomechanical contexts @xcite .",
    "the well - posedness and the numerical modeling of the latter model in the context of 1-d linear elastodynamics was previously studied in @xcite .",
    "the generation of harmonics and the distortion of simulated scattered velocity and stress waves were also observed .",
    "subsequent numerical experiments have brought to light an interesting property . in the case of a sinusoidal incident wave , the mean values of the elastic displacements around a crack",
    "were found to be discontinuous .",
    "the simulations conducted also indicated that the mean dilatation of the crack increases with the amplitude of the forcing levels .",
    "this purely nonlinear phenomenon ( the linear models predict no dilatation ) is of physical interest : experimenters can measure the dilatation @xcite and use the data obtained to deduce the properties of the crack .",
    "a preliminary theoretical study based on the use of a perturbation method was presented in @xcite . an analytical expression for the dilatation",
    "was obtained in that study and successfully compared with the numerical results . however , this expression gives only a local estimate , valid in the particular case of the hyperbolic model subjected to very low sinusoidal forcing levels .",
    "the aim of the present study is to provide a theoretical analysis which can be applied to any range of forcing levels and to a larger number of contact models .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows :    * in section 2 , the physical configuration is described .",
    "the family of strictly increasing convex jump conditions dealt with in this study is introduced .",
    "numerical simulations of the process of interest are presented ; * in section 3 , the problem is reduced to a nonautonomous differential equation . up to section 6 , only the case of sinusoidal forcing , which allows a complete understanding of the phenomena involved , is studied ; * in section 4 , preliminary results on the differential equation are presented .",
    "classical tools for dynamical systems are used : poincar map , phase portrait , lower and upper solutions @xcite ; * in section 5 , the main qualitative results of this study are presented .",
    "the mean , maximum and minimum aperture of the crack are bounded , and local estimates for small forcing are also proved ; * in section 6 , some of the previous results are extended to non - monochromatic periodic forcing conditions .",
    "the increase of the mean dilatation with the forcing parameter is proved in theorem [ theoremybargene ] .",
    "the most general quantitative result of the paper is given in equation ( [ ybarlocalgene ] ) ; * in section 7 , some conclusions are drawn about the physical observables .",
    "some future perspectives are also suggested .",
