    "we showed that it is possible to approximate the solution of fractal ising models via a sequence of exact solutions of ising models on finite periodic representations of the fractal under consideration .",
    "we found that the rate of convergence to the exact solution can be very slow , as the explicit example of the exact solution of the sierpinski gasket model shows .",
    "we found estimates for all @xmath110 fractals , and in particular for the sierpinsky carpet .",
    "numerical improvements can rapidly refine our results ultimately leading to the accurate determination of the exact critical temperatures for all non - trivial fractals of dimension smaller than two .",
    "the problem is much more difficult in the case of the critical exponents since universality ultimately sets in and renders any finite periodic approximation useless to the scope .",
    "but we can still speculate on the actual values for the critical exponents of the fractals .",
    "our analysis suggests two scenarios , related to the fate of the limits @xmath197 and @xmath198 . assuming the hyperscaling relation @xmath199 to hold true for fractals with infinite ramification number",
    ", then the continuity of the first limit implies @xmath200 and a change in the singularity structure of the free energy , i.e. @xmath201 . in this case",
    "both critical exponents will be continuous in the @xmath202 limit . if , instead , there is no change of singularity structure , i.e. @xmath203 retains the polynomial zero it has in the finite @xmath51 cases , then @xmath204 and , again assuming the hyperscaling relation , we find @xmath205 , which is not continuous in the @xmath202 limit but is a fairly good approximation for all _ fractional _ dimensions as compared to the rg results @xcite .",
    "obviously , it can also be that both limits are discontinuous or that the hyperscaling relation is either violated or does not contain @xmath206 .",
    "it can also be that these limits are sensible to the type of _ fractal _ under study , _",
    "i.e _ they depend on fine details such as lacunarity or connectivity  @xcite .",
    "the question of the existence of a lower critical dimension , for fractals with infinite ramification number ( or more restrictive properties ) , can now in principle be addressed by our method once the numerical routines are improved , since we have seen that the rate of convergence of the critical temperatures @xmath207 is slower the smaller the fractal dimension is .",
    "high values of @xmath51 will thus be needed to resolve the neighbourhood of a possible lower critical dimension .",
    "further interesting applications of our method are related to the study of ising models on other non - translationally invariant lattices , like those defined on aperiodic or random lattices , or with random interactions .",
