    "the core density of a neutron star is typically @xmath0 times higher than the nuclear density .",
    "such a dense matter at a relatively low temperature ( e.g. , @xmath1  k ) can not be probed by heavy - nuclei collision experiments or with observations of the early universe ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "plausibly the only way to probe this degenerate matter is to constrain the theoretically proposed equation of state ( eos ) models of neutron star cores @xcite . for a given eos model and an assumed central density , the stable structure of a non - spinning neutron star",
    "can be computed by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation @xcite .",
    "these stable stars trace a single curve in the mass ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 equatorial - radius ( @xmath4 ) space . therefore , measurement of mass and radius of the same non - spinning neutron star would constrain the eos models .",
    "if the neutron star spins , then the eos models can be constrained by the reliable measurements of three independent parameters , such as mass , radius and spin - frequency ( @xmath5 ) of the _ same _ neutron star ( e.g. , fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is extremely difficult because of a number of unknown systematics .",
    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be particularly promising systems for such measurements , because several complementary methods are available for them .",
    "a recent review by @xcite describes how the simultaneous application of these methods can reduce the systematic uncertainties .",
    "one such method involves broad relativistic spectral lines from the inner portion of the accretion disc .",
    "the strongest among these fluorescent spectral emission lines is the one for the @xmath6 transition of the iron atom ( or ion ) , and is observed from many accreting supermassive and stellar - mass black hole systems ( see @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite has , for the first time , established that the broad iron lines from neutron star lmxbs also originate from the inner accretion discs .",
    "this discovery was soon confirmed by @xcite using data from a different satellite .",
    "after these initial reports , the inner disc origin of broad iron line has been confirmed for several other neutron star lmxbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the broad iron line is affected by the strong gravity and spin of the compact star ( neutron star or black hole ) . before discussing how this relativistic line can be used to constrain the neutron star parameters ,",
    "let us see how it infers the black hole spin .",
    "the line shape , especially the extent of the red wing , carries the signature of the disc inner edge radius in the unit of stellar mass ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is because the red wing is primarily affected by longitudinal doppler effect due to the oribital motion of the disc matter , which broadens the line , and gravitational redshift , which shifts the line towards lower energies . since , for a black hole the disc can extend up to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco )",
    ", the black hole spin parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath9 : total angular momentum ; @xmath2 : mass ) , which determines the isco location , can be estimated by fitting the line shape with an appropriate relativistic model for kerr spacetime @xcite .",
    "a neutron star system is usually more complex than a black hole syetem because of the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) while a spinning black hole is defined by only two parameters ( mass and spin ) , and the spacetime around it is the kerr spacetime having analytical expressions , the structures and spacetimes of rapidly spinning neutron stars , usually harboured by lmxbs , may have to be numerically calculated from at least two parameters apart from the eos model @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) unlike a black hole , a neutron star has a hard surface which can have observable effects .",
    "therefore , for a neutron star , the disc may be terminated either by isco or by the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "an example of the competition between these two effects has been shown in the fig . 1 of @xcite and fig . 1 of @xcite , which demonstrate that usually circumferential radius @xmath10 of disc inner edge first decreases and then increases with the increase of stellar spin for a given eos model and mass .",
    "this complicates the measurement of @xmath11 and other stellar parameters using the inferred circumferential @xmath7 , if it is not known whether the disc terminates at isco or at the stellar surface .",
    "therefore , theoretical computations of @xmath10 as a function of stellar parameters for various eos models are essential .",
    "such computations will also be useful to determine if a measured @xmath7 directly gives the neutron star radius - to - mass ratio @xmath12 .",
    "note that the computations of @xmath10 and stellar parameters will involve the numerical calculations of rapidly spinning neutron star structures , and hence kerr spacetime can not be used . moreover , in order to constrain the eos models , directly measurable neutron star parameters ( e.g. , @xmath12 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 ; see @xcite ) should be expressed as functions of @xmath7 . since @xmath11 can not usually be measured directly , a @xmath11 vs. @xmath7 plot may not be very useful to constrain the eos models . in this paper , such plots",
    "( figs  [ abymrinm1.4 ] , [ abymrinm2.0 ] and [ abymrinmfrac0.95 ] ) have been shown for comparisons with kerr spacetime and to gain insight (   [ results ] ) .",
    "the procedure of constraining eos models using directly measurable parameters vs. @xmath7 relations can be utilized only if @xmath13 , because a much larger value of @xmath7 might imply the truncation of the disc by other effects ( see   [ discussion ] ) .",
    "particularly useful would be @xmath14 , because such values will confirm the effect of neutron star spin on a corotating disc .",
    "therefore , a crucial question is whether observations show that @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite report that @xmath7 values fall into a small range of @xmath15 for most of the neutron star lmxbs with established relativistic disc lines .",
    "moreover , although these authors could not measure a value of @xmath7 less than 6 ( as they used non - spinning , i.e. , schwarzschild spacetime ) , many of their fitted @xmath7 values across the sources pegged at the lower limit 6 .",
    "this happenned for both phenomenological and reflection models , and even when the compton broadening was taken into account @xcite .",
    "such pegged best - fit values strongly suggest that @xmath14 for many cases , which is supported by the disc line fitting with spinning kerr spacetime models @xcite .",
    "this provides a good motivation to theoretically explore the above mentioned procedure to constrain the eos models .    since , in this paper , we have computed neutron star structures and the corresponding isco locations , let us briefly review some of the previous studies on this topic .",
    "@xcite computed isco location with slow stellar spin approximation .",
    "@xcite numerically calculated rapidly spinning neutron star structures in full general relativity using realistic eos models .",
    "@xcite used these structure calculations to compute isco locations for a few cases .",
    "@xcite studied if strange stars in lmxbs could be excluded using the orbital frequency at isco .",
    "the relevance of higher - order multipoles on the isco location was analytically probed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed stellar models , multipole moments and isco locations , and compared the isco results with the @xcite results for analytic solution for spacetime around rapidly spinning neutron stars , kerr isco results and @xcite results .",
    "the results of @xcite show that higher multipole moments cause differences between rapidly spinning neutron star isco and kerr isco . @xcite and @xcite studied the isco around a spinning magnetic neutron star .",
    "@xcite calculated circular geodesics in the hartle - thorne metric for slowly spinning neutron stars .",
    "@xcite found that hartle - thorne approximation gives isco radii accurate to within 1% .",
    "@xcite suggested approximate analytic expressions for circular orbits around rapidly spinning neutron stars .",
    "disc lines have so far been used to measure the black hole spin ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been proposed that these lines could be used to put an upper limit on the neutron star radius @xcite and to constrain other stellar parameters @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , plausible methods to measure these parameters , and hence to constrain the eos models in a systematic way using appropriate spacetimes have not been studied so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore these methods .",
    "we have done so by calculating a huge number of neutron star structures , and the corresponding isco locations , if such a location is outside the neutron star .",
    "although , a large set of papers reported the studies on such structures and locations ( as indicated in the previous paragraph ) , none of these aimed to probe neutron star parameters using iron lines . in   [ methods ] ,   [ results ] and   [ discussion ] , we describe our method , give the results and provide a discussion respectively .",
    "note that , since the accretion disc is believed to be thin , we have not considered nonequatorial orbits in our calculations .",
    "we have also not considered counterrotating orbits , because that would imply @xmath16 , which could be easily confused with truncations caused by other effects ( see   [ discussion ] ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the procedure to compute rapidly spinning neutron star structures , and their equilibrium sequences .",
    "the spacetime around such a star can be described by the following metric ( using @xmath17 ; @xcite ) : @xmath18 where the metric potentials @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the angular speed ( @xmath22 ) of the stellar fluid relative to the local inertial frame are all functions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for a given eos model , and assumed values of stellar central density and polar - radius to equatorial - radius ratio , einstein s field equations can be solved to find out @xmath23 and @xmath24 dependence of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as well as to obtain the stable stellar structure @xcite .",
    "this equilibrium solution can then be used to calculate bulk structure parameters ( e.g. , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 ) of the spinning neutron star .",
    "note that , henceforth , @xmath4 ( @xmath25 ) will denote equatorial circumferential radius of the neutron star ( equation b6 of @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of motion of a test particle in the spacetime around such a star are given in @xcite .",
    "for example , the radial equation of motion is r@xmath26e@xmath27v@xmath28 , where , @xmath29 is the proper time , e is the specific energy and a constant of motion , and v is the effective potential .",
    "v is given by v@xmath30 + 2\\omega$]e@xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the specific angular momentum , a constant of motion .",
    "we determine the radius of isco using the condition v@xmath33 = 0 , where a comma followed by one @xmath23 represents a first - order partial derivative with respect to @xmath23 and so on @xcite .",
    "thus we can compute both circumferential radius of isco ( denoted by @xmath34 ) and @xmath4 , and set the theoretical value of @xmath10 to the larger of them ( see   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "for each eos model , we have calculated @xmath5 sequences of equilibrium structures keeping @xmath35 constant , and changing other parameters .",
    "since @xmath5 is not an input for computing structures , a number of iterations are usually needed to compute the structure for a desired @xmath5 value .",
    "the other sequences ( e.g. , @xmath2 sequence , @xmath12 sequence ; figures of   [ results ] ) have been calculated by interpolations of @xmath5 sequences .",
    "we have used four representative eos models of widely varying stiffness properties .",
    "this ensures sufficient generality of our results .",
    "we briefly describe these models below .",
    "_ model a _",
    "@xcite : this very stiff eos model with maximum non - spinning mass @xmath36 is a field theoretical eos for neutron - rich matter in beta equilibrium based on the chiral sigma model . _",
    "model b _ @xcite : this stiff eos model with @xmath37 is the argonne @xmath38 model of two - nucleon interaction , with the three - nucleon interaction ( urbana ix [ uix ] model ) and the effect of relativistic boost corrections . _",
    "@xcite : this intermediate eos model with @xmath39 is a microscopic eos for asymmetric nuclear matter , derived from the brueckner - bethe - goldstone many  body theory with explicit three - body terms .",
    "_ model d _",
    "@xcite : this very soft eos model with @xmath40 assumes an admixture of hyperons with the hyperonic potentials similar to the nucleon - nucleon potentials , but altered suitably to represent the different isospin states .",
    "we have computed @xmath5 sequences (   [ methods ] ) for 15 @xmath5 values in the range of @xmath41 hz for each eos model .",
    "about 16000 neutron star structures have been calculated to establish our results , and we give example figures in this section using a fraction of our computed numbers . the code to compute these structures and @xmath34 values is well tested @xcite .",
    "so far kerr spacetime has been used to model the iron lines from spinning neutron star systems .",
    "therefore , first we examine how our @xmath11 vs. @xmath7 plot deviates from the corresponding kerr curve , in order to find out if kerr calculations for iron lines can give acceptable constraints on neutron star parameters .",
    "[ abymrinm1.4 ] shows when the equatorial radius of the neutron star is smaller than the isco radius , the deviation is relatively small , but is not negligible , depending on the values of @xmath5 and @xmath2 and the chosen eos model .",
    "but when the neutron star equatorial radius is larger than the isco radius ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the deviation is large because stellar equatorial radius increases with the increase of @xmath5 , and such a situation does not occur for black holes ( kerr spacetime ) .",
    "for example , for the eos model a , the stellar equatorial radius is greater than the isco radius for all @xmath5 values for @xmath42 , and hence the deviation is always very large .",
    "however , for @xmath43 , the stellar equatorial radius is less than the isco radius for smaller values of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ abymrinm2.0 ] ) . in this case , the curves for both eos models a and b are closer to the kerr curve compared to these curves for @xmath42 .",
    "however , for @xmath43 , stable neutron star structures do not exist for eos models c and d. therefore , from fig .",
    "[ abymrinm1.4 ] and fig .",
    "[ abymrinm2.0 ] we find that the deviation is more for ( 1 ) higher @xmath5 , ( 2 ) lower @xmath2 , and ( 3 ) stiffer eos models .",
    "the first two effects can also be seen in fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "these effects are expected for @xmath44 , because all these three points result in the increase of @xmath4 .",
    "let us now try to understand these points for @xmath45 .",
    "the first point is understandable , because for @xmath46 the spacetime outside even a neutron star is schwarzschild , which is the non - spinning special case of kerr .",
    "the second point could be understood from the fact that for lower @xmath2 the neutron star is usually less compact ( that is the hard surface is farther from the centre ) , causing its spacetime to deviate more from that of a black hole .",
    "the third point may be explained from the lesser stellar compactness for a stiffer eos model for given @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , we find that if @xmath47 is kept fixed instead of @xmath2 , the differences among the @xmath11 vs. @xmath7 curves for various eos models are small ( fig .  [ abymrinmfrac0.95 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that @xmath48 may be a suitable parameter to characterize an eos model .    after finding that the kerr spacetime is usually not good enough to model @xmath7 , and",
    "since this spacetime can not be used for neutron star parameter calculation , we have explored ways to constrain stellar eos models using appropriate general relativistic computations for neutron stars ( see   [ methods ] ) .",
    "we have checked the relation between @xmath7 and a few stellar parameters , which can be measured from independent methods .",
    "these parameters are @xmath5 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "whenever @xmath5 can be measured ( using regular pulsations or burst oscillations ; @xcite ) , it is measured very accurately .",
