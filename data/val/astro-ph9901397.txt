    "owing to the doppler shift , an element of material in circular motion produces spectral lines with a sinusoidal modulation of wavelength .",
    "observations of such ` s - waves ' in time - resolved spectra are a primary diagnostic for many fields .",
    "for instance , vogt &  penrod ( 1983 ) developed a doppler imaging technique to map line - profile changes onto star spots on the rotating surfaces of active stars .",
    "a similar , doppler tomography technique was first applied to close binaries by marsh &  horne ( 1988 ) .",
    "it inverts a phase - resolved spectrum into a 2-dimensional velocity map in the rotating frame .",
    "the amplitude and phase of each component s - wave of a phase - resolved spectrum maps onto a particular x , y location on the velocity map .",
    "the original implementation of doppler tomography ensured a unique velocity map by using a maximum entropy method .",
    "however , a computationally - easier implementation , fourier - filtered back - projection , has become more popular .",
    "this sums the flux along the track of each possible s - wave to fill out the velocity map ( see , e.g. , robinson , marsh &  smak 1993 ) .",
    "tomography of the orbital cycle in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) has become common , with too many instances now in the literature to list here , although the extensive compilation by kaitchuck  ( 1994 ) is worth noting ( this paper , marsh &  horne 1998 , and robinson  1993 are good tutorials for those unfamiliar with tomography applied to cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "the technique works well for non - magnetic cvs , and for the am her stars , where the spin cycle of the magnetic white dwarf is locked to the binary orbit ( see schwope , mantel &  horne 1997 for sample tomograms ) .    however , in magnetic cvs which are nt phase - locked ( the intermediate polars ) the emission lines also vary with the white - dwarf spin cycle as the magnetically - threaded material is wheeled round by the dipolar field .",
    "variations on more than one periodicity are nt accounted for in standard tomography .",
    "one remedy is to calculate tomograms on the orbital and spin cycles separately , assuming that variations on the other cycle smear into a phase - invariant profile that can be subtracted .",
    "the process of calculating a tomogram on a spin cycle is identical to that of calculating an orbital tomogram  the tomography algorithm simply projects or de - projects between circular motion and trailed spectra , without caring whether the motion is orbital or spin related .",
    "the only difference is that , while orbital tomography should reveal the structures fixed in the binary frame ( the disc , secondary star and accretion stream ) , spin - cycle tomography should instead provide velocity maps of the ` accretion curtains ' of magnetically channelled material falling onto the white dwarf .",
    "this technique has so far been used only twice , in the papers hellier ( 1997 ) and still , duck &  marsh ( 1998 ) , but several other datasets suitable for tomography are in the literature .",
    "here , i present a compilation of spin - cycle tomograms from old and new data , with the aim of allowing comparisons between different stars and of investigating whether spin - cycle tomography is a useful diagnostic tool .",
    "a review of intermediate polars ( and references for the stars discussed here ) is given by patterson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the standard picture supposes that circulating material ( conventionally a disk ) feeds material onto the magnetosphere ( extending to 10 white dwarf radii ) , and that inside the magnetosphere the accreting material follows the field lines of a dipolar field , which is tilted with respect to the spin axis .",
    "the tilt causes the field to pick up material preferentially from the region of the disk to which the pole points , so that material flows to the upper pole from one side of the disk and to the lower pole from the other side ( several papers , including hellier , cropper &  mason 1991 , present illustrations of this process ) .",
    "the azimuthal extents of the resulting accretion curtains are poorly known , with little guidance from theory .",
    "i present spin - cycle tomograms of the emission lines of seven intermediate polars ( they are listed in table  1 along with the paper in which the data originally appeared ) . an eighth star , tv  col , is not included because the spin - cycle variations of the emission lines are too weak ( hellier 1993a ) . for details of the data analysis and further discussion of the data",
    "see the individual papers .    for this paper",
    "the first step was to plot the line profile as a function of the spin period ( uppermost panels in each section of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the spin - varying component of the emission will come mostly from within the rotating magnetosphere ( although some could result from irradiation of an accretion disk by spin - pulsed x - rays ) .",
    "emission from further out ( the disk , secondary star and stream ) is expected to vary on the orbital cycle or on the beat cycle between the spin and orbital cycles .",
    "thus the spin - folded data will be diluted by these components .",
    "the second step , therefore , was to subtract the phase - invariant profile ( the lowest value at each wavelength ) to leave only the spin - varying component ( shown in the panels second from top in each section of fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the subtraction is imperfect , the residual phase - invariant emission maps to azimuthally - symmetric rings in a tomogram , so any such structures should be discounted .",
    "the spin - folded data were not corrected for the orbital motion of the white dwarf , since for most ips we do not know the amplitude or phase of the white dwarf motion .",
    "these motions will effectively blur the spin - folded data , although since they typically have amplitudes ( 80 ) which are less than the infall motion near the white dwarf , they will not dominate .",
    "thus the spin - cycle tomograms can be taken as centered on the white dwarf , but blurred by the orbital motion of the white dwarf .",
    "the third step was to compute the tomogram of the spin - varying emission , using the fourier - filtered back - projection recipe of robinson ( 1993 ) .",
    "lastly , to check the result , i re - created the phase - resolved spectra from the tomograms ( bottom panels in fig .  1 ) .    for reasons of space",
    "i show the result for only one emission line for each star . for most i",
    "show , since a larger fraction of it arises in the magnetosphere than for the balmer or  lines , and thus the spin cycle variations are clearest . for ex  hya and rx123838 , which do nt have strong ,",
    "see the individual papers on each star for profiles of the lines not shown .    before presenting the data i ll review some of the assumptions of doppler tomography .",
    "the method projects onto a plane of transverse velocity versus radial velocity , but is not sensitive to motion out of the plane . for mapping accretion disks , which are flat to a good approximation ,",
    "this is accounted for by a simple @xmath2 projection factor .",
    "however , a dipole field diverts the accreting material out of the orbital plane , so this limitation needs to be borne in mind for intermediate polars .",
    "secondly , a change of phase of the spectra corresponds to a rotation of the tomogram . in the following",
    "i have phased the data so that phase 1 coincides with the optical and/or x - ray maximum of the spin pulse ( where known ) .",
    "how this relates to the orientation of the dipole is model dependent , and is discussed below .",
    "a more serious limitation is that tomography ( in both back - projection and maximum entropy implementations ) assumes that each emitting element is equally visible at all orbital phases , ignoring occultations and optical depth effects .",
    "we shall see that this assumption is violated in many intermediate polars , which can lead to misleading tomograms .",
    "if one suspects that opacity effects are causing bright regions in the trailed spectra one can trace along the relevant s - waves to judge which regions of the tomogram will be anomalously bright .",
    "the individual stars are shown in fig .",
    "1 panels @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the  line in ao  psc shows a low velocity component , brightening and fading over the cycle , and a higher - velocity s - wave phased with maximum blueshift at phase 1 ( which is optical and x - ray pulse maximum ) .",
    "hellier  ( 1991 ) referred to this as a ` spin - wave ' to distinguish it from the term ` s - wave ' , which is commonly used for the specific case of the orbital modulation caused by the impact of the accretion stream with the disk .",
    "the spin - wave maps to the diffuse area of emission at `` 3 oclock '' in the tomogram .",
    "the reconstructed data is a fair match to the observed data , although it struggles with the low velocity component ( which violates the assumption of constant brightness over the cycle ) .",
    "the finding of maximum blueshift at phase 1 led to the ` accretion curtain ' model of intermediate polars , in which optical and x - ray maximum occurs when the upper magnetic pole points away from us , and we predominantly see emission moving towards us onto the upper pole ( hellier  1987 ; 1991 ) .",
    "thus the interpretation of the tomogram is that it shows a velocity image of the upper accretion curtain .",
    "we can make several remarks .",
    "firstly , since there is little or no emission to the left of the y - axis , we are seeing no  from the lower pole . secondly , since the velocities are low compared to the 3000-  white - dwarf escape velocity , even allowing for a reduction by a factor 2 through projection onto the line of sight , we are seeing emission from relatively far out in the accretion curtains , at a few white dwarf radii ( see hellier  1991 for more discussion of this ) .",
    "thirdly , the fact that the emission subtends 110  at the origin suggests that the accretion curtain is extended over this angle , picking up material from the disk over a wide range of azimuth .",
    "fo  aqr gives a similar result to ao  psc , with a spin - wave having maximum blueshift near phase 1 ( optical pulse maximum ) .",
    "intensity changes in the line core are again poorly handled by the tomogram  the symmetry of the tomography process means that all features in the reconstructed spectra are repeated half a cycle later , but reversed in velocity , resulting in spurious features in the line core .",
    "in addition to the line - core features , the tomogram again shows diffuse emission centered on 3 oclock . as with ao  psc",
    ", the emission appears to be from only one pole , but it subtends a greater angle than in ao  psc , suggesting that the curtain is even more extended azimuthally .",
    "again , the low velocities imply that the emission is from the outer parts of the magnetosphere ( particularly since fo  aqr is a high - inclination system with a grazing eclipse of the disk , where motions will be largely in the line of sight ) .",
    "this is expected since x - ray irradiation will ionize the helium almost completely nearer the white dwarf .    the phasing accords with results from the x - ray band .",
    "near phase 1 , when the emission is bluest , and thus ( according to the accretion curtain model ) the upper pole is furthest from us , the x - ray pulse shows a narrow dip suggesting that the upper pole passes briefly over the white dwarf limb ( e.g.  hellier 1993b ) .",
    "bg  cmi shows a lower s / n version of the behavior seen in ao  psc and fo  aqr , again with greater emission around 3 oclock , but broken up into separate blobs due to the greater noise .",
    "the tomogram picks up a weak spin - wave , again with maximum blueshift at x - ray and optical pulse maximum .",
    "the tomogram for pq  gem shows clear evidence for emission from both upper and lower accretion curtains .",
    "indeed , one can interpret the tomogram showing a nearly - complete azimuthal ring of emission , brightening at the locations to which the upper and lower poles point ( though perhaps this is too neat to be true ! ) .",
    "again , even though pq  gem is probably at a low inclination ( hellier 1997 estimated 30 ) , the low velocities imply that we are seeing emission from several white dwarf radii out .",
    "phase 1 is again the maximum of the blue - optical and hard - x - ray spin pulse , which normally locates the phase at which the poles point towards and away from us .",
    "note , though , that the curtains in the tomogram appear rotated by 40  from the x - axis .",
    "these facts suggest that the curtains are twisted so that material at the magnetosphere feeds predominantly onto field lines at an azimuth 40  ahead of the location at which it hits the white dwarf ( considered in the rotating frame ) .",
    "encouragingly , there is additional evidence from the x - ray lightcurves ( mason 1997 ) and from polarimetry ( potter  1997 ) for the same effect , with material accreting predominantly along field lines ahead of the magnetic poles .",
    "one would expect the brighter of the poles to be the upper pole .",
    "since the brighter pole in the tomogram is at lower - left , this implies that the upper pole points towards us at blue - optical and hard - x - ray pulse maximum .",
    "this is the opposite phasing to that deduced for the three stars above , but this phasing is also supported by the x - ray and polarimetric results of mason ( 1997 ) and potter  ( 1997 ) .",
    "perhaps since pq gem shows double - humped pulses in the red and in soft x - rays ( in contrast to nearly sinusoidal pulses for the other stars ) it is not surprising that it is anomalous .",
    "see hellier ( 1997 ) , mason ( 1997 ) and potter  ( 1997 ) for a fuller discussion of these issues .",
    "rx171224 probably does nt have an accretion disk .",
    "while the polarisation is pulsed at the 927-s spin period , the x - ray emission is pulsed at the 1003-s beat period ( buckley  1997 ) , implying the direct impact of the accretion stream with the magnetosphere ( e.g.  hellier 1991 ) .",
    "thus we might expect different behavior in rx171224 .",
    "the spectroscopy presented here is previously unpublished data obtained on the 3.9-m aat on the nights 1996 may 1113 at a resolution of 1.5   with the rgo spectrograph .",
    "a full account will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the phasing of the data is arbitrary since we do nt yet have an ephemeris for the spin pulse .",
    "the narrowness of the lines and the minimal modulation at the orbital period imply a low inclination for rx171224 .",
    "the phase - resolved spectra show a central core , brightening and fading over the cycle , together with red and blue wings brightening in phase with each other but in anti - phase with the core .",
    "the violation of the constant - brightness assumption means that the tomogram does not do a good job , as can be seen from the reconstructed profile , where the algorithm has tried to fill out the features in phase .",
    "the phase - resolved spectra , though , can be interpreted by comparison with the other stars .",
    "the simultaneous blue and red wings suggest that we are seeing emission from material falling to both poles .",
    "optical depth effects ( or similar ) prevent these from creating full spin - waves , as seen in ao  psc .",
    "ex  hya and rx123838 both have weak  lines which show little spin modulation , thus i show  lines instead .",
    "note , also , that since the lines are much broader in these two stars , the data are presented on a different scale .",
    "ex  hya poses particular difficulties ( not encountered in the other systems considered here ) since the spin period is almost exactly 2/3  of the orbital period , and thus orbital - cycle variations do not smear out when folded on spin phase , but instead repeat every 3 spin cycles .",
    "this is the origin of most of the structure in the line at velocities @xmath51000 ( see hellier  1987 ) . aside from this , the line profiles show broad red and blue wings at phase 1.0 , fading at phase 0.5 .",
    "the fact that changes in intensity dominate over velocity variations means that the tomogram does a poor job , showing little of interest .",
    "the higher velocities in ex  hya imply that we are seeing emission from nearer the white dwarf , @xmath6 from the surface ( see hellier  1987 ) .",
    "the simultaneously - bright red and blue wings , and the general symmetry of the line profiles , mean that we are seeing emission from both poles .",
    "the phasing suggests that the upper pole points away from the observer at phase 1 ( optical and x - ray pulse maximum ) , when the parts of the accretion curtain near the white dwarf are readily visible .",
    "half a cycle later , the outer regions of the upper curtain obscure the white dwarf and the high velocity material near it , resulting in the fainter , narrower line profile at phase 0.5 .",
    "this change in the visibility of the emitting regions prevents us seeing full spin - waves , which would otherwise produce a red wing and a blue wing at phase 0.5 as continuations of the blue wing and red wing ( respectively ) at phase 1 .",
    "rx123838 was identified as an intermediate polar by buckley  ( 1998 ) .",
    "it has many similarities to ex  hya , including similar spin and orbital periods ( e.g.  hellier , beardmore &  buckley 1998 ) and similar spectroscopic behavior , including a partial eclipse of the disk .",
    "the data presented are unpublished aat spectra from the same run as the rx171224 data described above .",
    "the phasing is arbitrary , since we do nt yet have an ephemeris for the spin cycle .",
    "again , intensity changes in the  line dominate over velocity changes and thus the tomography is not helpful , producing a poor reconstruction of the data .",
    "the overall symmetry of the profile , the broad wings , and the intensity changes , point to the same explanation as that adopted for ex  hya .",
    "however , the brighter blue wing at phase 0.6 implies an asymmetry between the poles .",
    "in four intermediate polars ( ex  hya , pq  gem , rx171224 &  rx123838 ) we see line emission from material falling onto both magnetic poles of the white dwarf . in three other stars ( ao  psc , fo  aqr and bg  cmi ) we see line emission from only the upper pole .",
    "a possible explanation is that the three stars showing only the upper pole are all high inclination systems ( @xmath760 ) with grazing eclipses or x - ray dips ( see , e.g. , hellier 1995 ) .",
    "they also show line emission only from the outer parts of the accretion curtains , judging from the low velocities of the spin - cycle variations .",
    "the outer regions of the lower accretion curtain could be hidden in a high inclination system , obscured by the inner edge of the accretion disk when it points towards us and obscured by the upper accretion curtain when it points away , explaining the lack of observed emission .    the stars showing emission from both accretion curtains are either low inclination systems ( pq  gem &  rx171224 at 30 ) in which the lower pole would not be obscured by the inner disk , or they are high inclination systems below the period gap ( ex  hya &  rx123838 ) . in the latter stars we are seeing higher velocity material much closer to the white dwarf ( perhaps as a result of a lower accretion rate ) so again the lower pole will not be obscured by the disk",
    ".    tomography of three of the stars ( ao  psc , fo  aqr and pq  gem ) reveals the azimuthal extent of line emission , showing that accretion curtains extend over angles @xmath7100  ( although note that line emission can emerge from regions carrying only a small fraction of the accretion flow ) .",
    "further , tomography of pq  gem shows a twist in the accretion curtains with material feeding onto field lines 40   ahead of the location at which it hits the white dwarf ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "such results show that spin - cycle tomography can be a valuable tool for studying accretion in intermediate polars . however , the changing optical depth through the curtain as its aspect changes causes large emission - line flux changes over the spin cycle .",
    "since this is not taken into account , tomography can give misleading results in some systems , so needs to be interpreted with caution .",
