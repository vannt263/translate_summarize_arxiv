    "the sm ( standard model ) @xcite which describes within an unprecedental scale of energies and distances the strong and electroweak interactions of elementary particles relays on a few basic principles - the renormalizability , the gauge invariance and the spontaneous breaking of the underlying gauge symmetry .",
    "the principle of the renormalizability @xcite which is considered often as something beyond the limits of experimental test is one of the most important ( if not the major ) ingredients of the quantum field theory .",
    "the sm gauge group @xmath0 is spontaneously broken to @xmath1 by the existence of scalar field with nonzero vacuum expectation value , leading to massive vector bosons - the @xmath2 and @xmath3 - which mediate the weak interactions ; the photon remains massless .",
    "one physical degree of freedom remains in the scalar sector , a neutral scalar boson ( higgs boson ) @xmath4 , which is the last nondiscovered particle of the sm .",
    "it should be noted that the existence of the higgs boson is direct consequence of the renormalizability of the sm model .",
    "the @xmath5 gauge group describes the strong interactions ( quantum chromodynamics or qcd ) .",
    "the eight vector gluons carry colour charges and are selfinteracting . due to the property of asymptotic freedom the effective qcd coupling constant",
    "@xmath6 is small for large momentum transfers that allows to calculate reliably deep inelastic cross sections .",
    "the fundamental fermions in the sm are leptons and quarks ; the left - handed states are doublets under @xmath7 gauge group , while the right - handed states are singlets .",
    "there are three generations of fermions , each generation identical except for mass .    despite the apparent striking success of the sm",
    ", there are a lot of reasons why it is not the ultimate theory . in the sm",
    "the neutrinos are massless and hence there are no neutrino oscillations .",
    "however there is strong evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite coming from measurements of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere and from a deficit in the flux of electron neutrinos from sun .",
    "it is easy to extend the sm to include neutrino masses , however the natural explanation of small neutrino masses is rather untrivial and probably it requires qualitatively new physics . in the sm an elementary higgs field generates masses for the @xmath8 , @xmath3 and fermions . for the sm to be consistent",
    "the higgs boson mass should be relatively light @xmath9 .",
    "the tree - level higgs boson mass receives quadratically divergent corrections at quantum level : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is some ultraviolet cutoff . the natural ultraviolet cutoff in particle physics is usually assumed to be the planck scale @xmath12 or grand unification scale @xmath13 .",
    "hence the natural scale for the higgs boson mass is @xmath14 .",
    "to explain the smallness of the higgs boson mass some delicate cancellation is required that is rather untrivial `` fine tuning '' or gauge hierarchy problem . at present the supersymmetric solution @xcite , @xcite of the gauge hierarchy problem",
    "is the most fashionable one .",
    "it predicts that the masses of supersymmetric particles have to be lighter than @xmath15 .",
    "other possible explanation is based on models with `` technicolour '' @xcite .",
    "also we ca nt exclude the possibility that the natural scale of the nature is @xmath16 . at any rate all solutions of the gauge hierarchy problem predict the existence of new physics at tev scale .",
    "other untrivial problem is that the sm ca nt predict the fermion masses , which vary over at least five orders of magnitude ( fermion problem ) .    the scientific programme at the lhc ( large hadron collider ) @xcite which will be the biggest particle accelerator complex ever built in the world consists in many goals .",

    "the main signature are the missing transverse energy events which are the consequence of undetected lightest stable supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) predicted in supersymmetric models with r - parity conservation .",
    "therefore it is necessary to set stringent requirements for the hermeticity and @xmath34 capability of the detector .",
    "also the search for new physics different from supersymmetry ( new gauge bosons @xmath35 and @xmath36 , additional dimensions etc . ) requires high resolution lepton measurements and charge identification even in the @xmath37 range of a few tev .",
