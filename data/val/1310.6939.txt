    "the rapid burster ( rb ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter b13 ) .",
    "it is located in the globular cluster liller 1 , at a distance of @xmath1  kpc @xcite .",
    "it is unique , in that it shows both type i bursts , which are x - ray eruptions due to the heating and cooling of the ns photosphere after a thermonuclear shell flash of accreted material ( see e.g. reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) , and type ii bursts , most likely due to the release of gravitational energy during sudden accretion episodes @xcite .",
    "while the former are relatively well understood and observed in over a hundred sources , it remains unclear why the latter have been unambiguously detected in only two ns lmxbs , the other one being the slowly rotating ( 2  hz ) bursting pulsar @xcite .",

    "( _ rxte _ ) observed 125 type i and about 7050 type ii bursts from the rb . a complete analysis ( b13 ) of the type i burst sample shows that type i bursts appear in the rb over a remarkably large range of mass accretion rates , recurring faster as its bolometric luminosity increases to a large fraction of the eddington limit , a behaviour only shared with the 11  hz pulsar igr j17480 - 2446 @xcite among over a hundred bursting lmxbs ( see e.g. ) .",
    "the known ns spin frequencies in these systems range between 245 and 620  hz , and the exceptional bursting behaviour of igr j17480 - 2446 can be explained only thanks to its slow ns spin @xcite .",
    "this indicates the rb should be a slow rotator too ( b13 ) .",
    "type ii bursts instead appear only after the outburst has significantly decayed , usually below a bolometric persistent flux of @xmath2@xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "they often show a relaxation - oscillator behaviour , meaning that the fluence in a type ii burst is proportional to the waiting time to the next one .",
    "these properties hint at disc - magnetosphere interactions that are largely thought to control the type ii burst phenomenon @xcite .",
    "type ii bursts in the rb are often accompanied by low - frequency quasi periodic oscillations ( lf qpos ) in the persistent emission , both at frequencies @xmath6 between 2 and 4  hz , and at much slower values centred about an average of 42  mhz .",
    "they both cease right before the onset of a type ii burst , so it is likely that they originate in the same mass reservoir whose spasmodic accretion is responsible for the type ii burst @xcite .",
    "much theoretical work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has focussed on the dynamical role of the magnetic field , which can act as a `` gating '' mechanism to the accretion flow once the mass accretion rate drops below a certain threshold .",
    "these models could explain the episodic accretion that is responsible for the type ii burst phenomenon , but also lf qpos at low mass accretion rates , as those observed in the lightcurves of the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ( amxps ) sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite and ngc 6440 x-2 @xcite .",
    "we report here on six peculiar type i bursts that stand out among the rb pca sample because of a unique double - peaked structure first noticed by @xcite .",
    "we show that four of these bursts appear at the transition from the high / soft to the low / hard state @xcite , and that this takes place at the time of the first appearance of type ii bursts .",
    "we exclude the possibility that their double peaks are due to photospheric radius expansion ( pre ; see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also find a previously unreported qpo at a frequency of about 0.25  hz . the qpo becomes visible in the persistent emission a few days before the double - peaked bursts , peaks in amplitude at the time the bursts appear , even becoming directly visible in the lightcurve , and fades out over the next few days .",
    "we describe the spectral and timing properties of the double - peaked type i bursts and the lf qpo accompanying them , and investigate whether they can shed further light on the nature of the interaction between accretion and magnetic - field effects in the enigmatic rb .",

    "most measurements described here were obtained through observations with the pca .",
    "the pca @xcite is a non - imaging system consisting of five co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) that combine to a total effective area of 6500  @xmath7 at 6  kev , in a 2 to 60  kev bandpass .",
    "the photon energy resolution is 18 per cent full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at 6  kev and the time resolution is programmable down to about 1  @xmath8s .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) is approximately circular , with radius 1@xmath9 ( full width to zero response ) .",

    "six type i bursts have a peculiar double - peaked time profile .",
    "they are numbered 35 , 36 , 37 , 58 , 118 and 119 , following their chronological position among the 125 type i burst in the pca sample ( b13 ) .",
    "three of the six double - peaked type i bursts subject of this paper occurred during one outburst which is shown in fig .  [ fig : outburst ] .",
    "the burst lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : humps ] ) were constructed employing 0.125-s resolution standard 1 data .",
    "typically , type i x - ray bursts of the rb show a two - component decay profile , with a steeper 10-s long initial decay and a shallower 100-s long tail , whose relative amplitude varies ( b13 ) .",
    "we constructed an average type i burst profile employing 22 bursts which we chose because they show the longest and brightest decays .",
    "this average burst profile is plotted against each burst in fig .",
    "[ fig : humps ] .",
    "we define a few variables to help us quantify the morphology of the dip between the peaks .",
    "first , we applied an exponential fit to the first 200  s of the slow - decay portion of the burst after the second peak .",
    "we extrapolated this fit backwards to determine the time @xmath10 when it intercepts the first peak of the burst .",
    "the dip duration @xmath11 is the time between @xmath10 and the time of the second peak .",
    "the dip depth @xmath12 is the ratio of the number of photons lacking under the extrapolated curve during the interval @xmath11 over the total number of observed photons between the burst start- and end times ( defined as in b13 ) .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy of the burst data was performed following the same procedure and tools as in b13 .",
    "the particle and cosmic background were determined with ftool pcabackest and subtracted from all spectra .",
    "response matrices were generated with pcarsp ( v. 11.7.1 ) .",
    "all active pcus were employed , and a correction was applied for deadtime ( although it is always small for the rb ) . following the _ rxte _ cookbook prescription ,",
    "the analysis was limited to the @xmath13  kev range , and a systematic error of 0.5% was added in quadrature to the statistical error of the flux in each channel .",
    "the burst data were divided into a number of time bins , varying in duration to keep the photon count , and hence the relative error on the derived quantities , approximately constant .",
    "typical rb outbursts observed by _ rxte _ prior to november 1999 tend to have a fast rise of 1 to 3 days , followed by an exponential decay with an e - folding decay time of about 8 days .",
    "initially only type i bursts are observed .",
    "type ii bursts activity starts about 18 days into the outburst , when typically the bolometric flux decreased to a level of @xmath2@xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 .",
    "the first type ii bursts to appear ( the so - called mode-0 type ii bursts ) are long ( 200 - 300  s ) , bright ( up to 3000  c / s / pcu ) , flat - topped and short - lived , usually being visible for only a couple of days .",
    "we inspected all the light curves visually and only found 18 mode-0 type ii bursts .",
    "their rarity is due both to the short outburst fraction in which they are produced and to their long recurrence time , which for rb type ii bursts is proportional to the fluence in a burst ( the so - called relaxation - oscillator behaviour , @xcite ) .",
    "shorter , more frequent ( the so - called mode i and mode ii ) type ii bursts then follow for another couple of weeks until the end of the outburst @xcite .",
    "the august - september 1998 outburst during which bursts 35 through 37 appeared has an atypical lightcurve shape ( see fig.[fig : outburst ] ) , featuring a much faster decay , as well as much earlier mode-0 type ii bursts , which could have started already during the outburst rise @xcite .",
    "although no pca coverage is available for more than three days before , the timing of the three double - peaked bursts seems also quite interesting . as can be seen in fig.[fig : outburst ] , these double - peaked bursts occur during the initial phase of type ii bursts , at a time when the source is experiencing rapid and large variations in flux ( `` reflares '' ) .",
    "these considerations make us confident that the peculiar sequence of double - peaked type i bursts occurs close to the onset of the type ii bursting activity .",
    "burst 58 was observed eight days after the start time of the pca observations of the october 1999 outburst . in the time leading to it , twelve type i bursts are observed , and no type ii bursts .",
    "no observation is available in the three days prior to burst 58 , and not again until four days later .",
    "short ( mode - i ) type ii bursts are first observed ten days after burst 58 .",
    "it seems plausible that this could be a more typical outburst , and that the short - lived phase of strong , long and flat - topped ( mode-0 ) type ii bursts was missed because of the rather limited coverage around the time it could have occurred .",
    "bursts 118 and 119 took place during the last rb outburst observed by _ rxte _ , in january 2010 .",
    "less than 12  ks of pca data are available for this outburst , in 5 observations spanning only 3 days .",
    "it is therefore difficult to assess to what extent the outburst has already decayed when these bursts occur .",
    "however , starting in 2000 all outbursts recurred within a shorter time and peaked at significantly lower intensities ( masetti 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , the initial type - i - only phase of the outburst can be significantly shorter .",
    "judging from the asm lightcurve , bursts 118 and 119 occurred no longer than 2  days after the beginning of the outburst . none the less , the presence of six more type i bursts , the burst recurrence time ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : lightcurves ] ) , the count rate in the persistent emission and the lack of type ii bursts are all consistent with what is observed in the other four double - peaked bursts , which indicates a similar accretion state .            fig .",
    "[ fig : humps ] shows the six double - peaked type i bursts under analysis and table  [ tab : spectra ] lists their characteristics .",
    "bursts 35 through 37 occurred with a recurrence time of about 2.2  ks , which is in the middle of the range of observed values of all rb type i bursts ( b13 ) . in bursts 35 and 36",
    "the dip clearly lasts longer ( @xmath14  s ) and the flux even drops to about 5 per cent below the pre - burst emission level .",
    "the dip in burst 37 is instead shorter , at 25  s , and the flux only drops to about 20 per cent of the net burst peak count rate . while the qpo is not visible during the dips of bursts 35 and 36 , it is still present in that of burst 37 .",
    "the second peak is about 40 to 50 per cent as large as the first one .",
    "it is higher in burst 37 , where it occurs earlier .",
    "the qpo modulation is clearly visible again in the second portion of the decays .",
    "looking at fig .  [",
    "fig : humps ] , it is clear that the post - dip portion of the decay is significantly brighter than in the rest of the type i bursts sample . as a result ,",
    "the bursts are also longer .",
    "if however one only looks at the minima of the qpo , the decays might have durations comparable to those observed in the rest of the sample .",
    "burst 58 has a much dimmer second peak with respect to the other bursts , only about 15 per cent above the net burst count rate , which is however still significantly above the persistent emission .",
    "it features the longest dip , at @xmath15  s , going down to just about 4 per cent above the persistent emission , but still significantly above the noise fluctuations .",
    "the recurrence time for bursts 118 and 119 is 1.8  ks , similar to what is observed for bursts 3537 .",
    "their dips are about 30  s long , and briefly drop to count rates within 1 per cent of those observed right before the bursts .",
    "like in burst 37 , the qpo remains visible during the dip .",
    "their second peaks are about 30 per cent as large as the first ones .      [",

    "other lmxbs exhibit double - peaked bursts that are not due to pre . for example 4u",
    "1636 - 53 shows bursts with two @xcite and even three peaks @xcite .",
    "however , the time scales for this source are different than for the rb ( the peaks are separated by at most 5 s ) and the flux never drops below the pre - burst emission .",
    "the similarities are that the peak flux is also a factor of 2 to 3 below the eddington limit , the inferred mass accretion rate is relatively large and the bursts concentrate around the vertex of the island / banana branch of the ccd .",
    "non - pre double - peaked type i bursts have also been observed from 4u 1608 - 52 , gx 17 + 2 and 4u 1709 - 267 @xcite , all with durations shorter than 20  s.    there is great diversity in the observations of other sources , precluding a single explanation for all irregularities .",
    "the double - peaked bursts in the rb are no exception : they too are unique , particularly because of relatively long time scales for the dip ingress and egress and the simultaneous qpo behavior . we will now discuss several explanations for the double - peaks phenomenon in the other sources .",
    "one possibility is that the multiple peaks are the result of a variation in either the rate at which the energy is transported to the surface of the ns , or in the rate at which energy is released in the flash",
    ". a shear instability could mix layers which have undergone a thermonuclear flash with unburnt material lying above them , or there could be a waiting point in the rp - processes @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to keep unburnt fuel above burnt material without the two mixing @xcite , or to have the burning reaction chain stalling as long as the dips are sometimes observed to last @xcite .",
    "other explanations discussed in literature involve stalling of the burning front . for a weak burst with high - latitude ignition",
    ", the spreading of the flame could stall at the equator if that is where most of the disc material is accreted @xcite .",
    "otherwise , a temporary boosting of the magnetic field @xmath22 , due to the motion of the fluid upon ignition , could temporarily confine the burning region @xcite .",
    "obviously @xmath22 is not expected to be different for the double - peaked bursts and the rest of the rb bursts , nor is the fuel composition , given their similar timescales and energetics .",
    "the ignition location and the mass - accretion rate are therefore the remaining possible triggers for a confining mechanism that could give rise to the double peaks .",
    "perhaps high - latitude ignition could be rare enough to only happen in 6 bursts out of 125 , although these are not among the weakest in the sample as observed for double - peaked bursts in 4u 1636 - 53 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the possibility of magnetic confinement is at odds with the fact that the rb double - peaked bursts occur in a limited range of intermediate mass - accretion rates , with single - peaked bursts being observed at both higher and lower @xmath23 .      generally speaking ,",
    "all the scenarios discussed above revolve around phenomena confined to the surface .",
    "none of them can therefore explain why , in bursts 35 and 36 , the flux drops below pre - burst levels while the absorption column density increases .",
    "the accretion flow , responsible for the non - burst emission , must clearly also be affected .",
    "for example , the multi - peaked structure could result from scattering of the x - rays by material evaporated from the accretion disc during the flash , forming a burst - induced accretion disc corona .",
    "models seem however to require eddington - limited bursts @xcite , and indeed observations of radiative or dynamical interactions with the accretion disc have so far been limited to very energetic pre bursts . instead , the double - peaked bursts in the rb are sub - eddington by at least a factor of 2 , implying that the burst flux delivers insufficient radiation pressure to influence the accretion flow .",
    "even resorting to beaming , to raise the flux in a direction outside the line of sight to a sufficient level , the problem remains that the time scales are dynamical in nature and much shorter than those observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the energetic properties of these bursts are unremarkable with respect to the rest of the type i sample , which makes explaining their exceptionality difficult . none the less",
    ", the dips seem to be initiated by the bursts , responding to the burst with a delay of about 10  s. as a way around this , the origin of the dips might lie in a short - lived , peculiar geometry of the inner accretion flow rather than in the bursts themselves",
    ".    for a scenario that is independent of burst properties and features longer dips , one can look at dipping sources .",
    "these show periodic dips in their light curves that are thought to be caused by periodic obscuration of the central source by a structure formed in an interplay between the gas stream from the companion and the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "therefore , they have generally been inferred to be at inclination angles larger than @xmath24 , unless the splash traverses over the compact object to the other side of the accretion disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the depth , duration and spectral properties of the dips vary from source to source and from cycle to cycle @xcite .",
    "the time scale of the dips in the rb is similar to that shown by some dipping sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , as we said , the fact that the dips go twice below the pre - burst flux indicates that , as in dipping sources , the persistent emission is also partially obscured .",
    "most importantly , the rb dips spectrum is consistent with a larger portion of the flow coming in the line of sight .",
    "unlike in all other sources , however , in the rb the dips only occur during bursts .",
    "likely this means that the inclination angle is lower , since at a high inclination angle dips in the persistent emission should also be visible .",
    "none the less , obscuration phenomena of the surface might be possible even at low inclinations .",
    "3d mhd simulations by @xcite and @xcite showed that two different regimes of accretion on magnetized stars like amxps are possible in presence of a tilt ( @xmath25 ) between the rotational axis and the magnetic dipole . at large @xmath23 , in what they call the `` boundary layer '' regime , matter can accrete directly through the magnetosphere via narrow and tall `` tongues '' due to raleigh - taylor instability , forming a belt - shaped hot region on the surface of the star . instead at lower @xmath23 , in the so - called `` magnetospheric regime '' , the accretion flow forms few ( two or four ) ordered funnel streams toward the magnetic poles .",
    "if these predictions are correct , for a low inclination the appearance of obscuring funnels is indeed to be expected as @xmath23 goes down .",
    "furthermore , as these funnels are nothing but transient accretion episodes at low @xmath23 , they might help explain the onset of the type ii burst activity at the transition from the soft to the hard state . however , if this change in geometry is behind the obscuration , it remains unclear why double peaks would not be an overall characteristic of all bursts in the low @xmath23 state , and also whether the a burst - funnel interaction could reproduce the observed dip durations .",
    "qpos in lmxbs , no matter how difficult to explain , are always ascribed to a phenomenon in the accretion flow ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the only exceptions are mhz qpos which are thought to be due to marginal nuclear burning on the ns surface (;",
    "however , those qpos are interrupted by type i x - ray bursts @xcite and have frequencies one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the 0.25 hz qpos in the rb .",
    "thus , it is most likely that the dipping behavior and the 0.25 hz qpo in the rb are related to the accretion flow .",
    "we explore in this section two possible scenarios to explain the qpo : periodic obscurations and modulation of the accretion flow via interactions between the disc and the magnetosphere .",
    "at least three dipping bursting lmxbs ( xb 1323 - 619 , @xcite ; exo 0748 - 676 , @xcite ; and 4u 1746 - 37 , @xcite ) show @xmath261  hz qpos .",
    "their rms amplitudes are about 10 per cent , and the energy dependence of the rms amplitude is nearly flat .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude was found to be consistent with being constant during the persistent emission , the x - ray dips and , most importantly , type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the fact that the @xmath261  hz qpos persist during a dip with unchanged rms indicates that they are formed in a region at a smaller radius than that where the obscuration takes place .",
    "it seems therefore likely that the @xmath261  hz qpos detected in dipping lmxbs are caused by matter periodically obscuring our line of sight to the ns , perhaps due to lense - thirring precession of a tilted inner accretion disk around a compact object @xcite . despite the rough match in frequency and amplitude ,",
    "no dips have ever been observed in the persistent emission of the rb outside a burst , which seems at odds with a system viewed at a high inclination . also , the @xmath261  hz qpos of dipping sources span a much larger range of accretion states , whereas the qpo in the rb appears to be confined to the transition between the island and banana states .",
    "therefore we consider this scenario not likely to explain the 0.25  hz qpo in the rb .",
    "first reported by @xcite , the 1  hz qpo that is observed in the final stages of the outbursts of sax j1808.4 - 3658 was extensively studied by @xcite .",
    "they report a qpo frequency in the ( 0.8 - 1.6 )  hz range , and an rms amplitude that grows monotonically with energy up to about 17 kev .",
    "a 1  hz qpo of similar properties has been reported from ngc 6440 x-2 by @xcite , who suggest this feature has the same origin in both these amxps .",
    "the most likely origin for the qpo is an accretion flow instability arising at the inner edge of the disk @xcite . among the variety of mechanisms at hand",
    ", the most promising seems to be the one first proposed by @xcite and further explored by @xcite . in this model",
    "an instability can develop when the magnetosphere truncates the inner accretion disc at a radius @xmath27 that is outside but still close to the corotation radius @xmath28 . a new disk solution known as `` dead disc ''",
    "is then found @xcite which is alternative to the `` propeller '' regime , where the transfer of angular momentum effectively expels matter from the system , and the inner disc radius keeps increasing as @xmath23 decreases . when @xmath29 the transfer of angular momentum happens from the neutron star to the disk , spinning down the neutron star and changing the radial gas density distribution at the inner disc region without matter expulsion . in a dead disc @xmath27",
    "does not evolve far from @xmath28 and the matter keeps flowing in from the outer disc regions piling up there .",
    "if certain conditions are met at the magnetosphere - disk interaction @xcite a critical pressure is eventually reached under which the gas slips inside @xmath28 , thereby initiating a sudden accretion event .",
    "after that , the accumulated mass reservoir is depleted , and a new cycle begins .",
    "this instability is a potentially interesting model for the 0.25  hz qpo in the rb .",
    "the frequency of the instability depends on the viscous timescale at the inner disk edge , which in turn depends on the mass accretion rate and on the location of the inner disk ( see e.g. , eq .",
    "9 in @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the inner disk radius is not known for the rapid burster , since neither the spin frequency of the neutron star nor the strength of its magnetic dipole are known .    also , a slightly growing rms-@xmath30 relation is observed in the rb , which is also observed in the other two sources . while the increase is weaker than in sax j1808.4 - 3658 or ngc 6440 x-2 , this can be explained with the smaller fractional amplitude of the qpo in the rb . @xcite",
    "explain the monotonic increase in rms with energy in sax j1808.4 - 3658 and ngc 6440 x-2 arguing that as the instability is caused by changes in @xmath23 , and the latter change the density and temperature of the corona where the photons are upscattered , the qpo fluctuations will translate to a varying hardness of the spectrum , making the high energy flux more variable than the low energy one . in case of a strong persistent emission , as is the case in the rb , the effect will obviously be weaker .",
    "differences are , however , clearly present .",
    "the qpo in the two amxps can not be fit with a lorentzian because of its fast decline in power at low frequencies .",
    "this is however not seen in the rb qpo .",
    "furthermore , the rms amplitude of the qpo is more than one order of magnitude larger in the two other sources than in the rb .",
    "this is because nearly no accretion takes place during the qpo minima in sax j1808.4 - 3658 and ngc 6440 x-2 , which show the oscillation at moderately low luminosities . the higher count rates and",
    "the different qpo shape observed in the rb are therefore challenging to this scenario .",
    "even though the results from @xcite show that for certain ranges of parameters accretion can in fact continue to take place in the minima of the qpo , the instability is predicted to produce a much larger modulation of the mass accretion rate @xmath23 than observed in the rb , when at the time of the double - peaked bursts @xmath31 , roughly one order of magnitude larger than what observed in the two other sources at the time of the appearance of the qpo there .    if however we again invoke a two - channel accretion ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : multipeak ] ) , with a polar and an equatorial channels , one controlled by the instability and the other one unaffected by it , the lower amplitude would naturally follow .",
    "for example , while the centrifugal barrier could act to modulate the equatorial accretion , matter could be leaking from above and below it , and accrete along the @xmath22 lines .    also involving two - channel accretion ,",
    "the disc - magnetospheric interactions described in @xcite and @xcite can as well explain the appearance of periodicities in the lightcurve , via accretion - induced hotspots . while at high @xmath23 sporadically forming `` tongues '' hit the star in random places , so that the light curve is irregular , at low @xmath23 the funnels driving matter from the disc to the magnetic poles are relatively stable , so that the position of the hot spots is almost constant , resulting in a modulation of the lightcurve .",
    "again , the problem with this model is that it does not explain why the qpo is short - lived , rather than being an overall characteristic of the island state .      in table  [ tab : mechanisms ] we list the possible scenarios for the dips and the qpo , and which relevant observables they are capable of explaining .",
    "the only model that is not ruled out by any observable involves a relatively short - lived accretion state consisting of two different accretion channels , an equatorial and a polar one , in a system viewed at low inclination . as part of",
    "the inner accretion flow in this particular state goes along the magnetic field lines to the ns poles , it is then easier for material to come in the line of sight if the inclination angle is low , and for the burst to disturb the accretion flow , thereby causing the flux to dip below the pre - burst level , even if the burst flux is sub - eddington .",
    "since the 0.25  hz qpo disappears during some of the dips , its place of origin would also seem to be obscured by the same material .",
    "this suggests that the qpo originates close to the ns and closer than the x - ray emitting part of the accretion disk .",
    "the latter region probably reaches out to 10@xmath32 km @xcite , so the obscuring material would have to be substantially closer than that .",
    "if the qpo originates in the equatorial flow , the accretion channel along the magnetic field could be disturbed by the burst so that , given the low inclination , the radiation from the ns surface and the equatorial flow would be obscured , making the dips deeper than the pre - burst emission and causing the temporary disappearance of the qpo .",
    "if instead the qpo originates in the disrupted polar flow , its disappearance at the time when the dips are deeper than the pre - burst emission would still naturally follow .    to match the observations , this peculiar configuration should be short - lived , appearing roughly at the same time when the type ii burst do , and disappearing within days .",
    "it is generally thought that in the banana state , at larger mass - accretion rates , a geometrically thin and optically thick disc probably extends down to very close to the ns surface , whereas the lack of dips in the island state , at lower mass - accretion rates , could be due to a quasi - spherically symmetric accretion via an optically thin corona .",
    "the rarity of the double - peaked bursts and of the 0.25  hz qpo would then match the fact that they occur in a particular accretion state of the rb , when part of the accretion flow is starting to become diverted to the type ii bursting mechanism .",
    "we have reported the coincident observation of non - pre , double - peaked type i bursts and a lf qpo with a frequency of about 0.25  hz .",
    "they occur at the transition from the banana to the island state , when the geometry of the accretion flow is expected to change .",
    "this transition also coincides with the appearance of type ii bursts . despite being sometimes at roughly the same count rate as the pre - burst persistent emission",
    ", the dip between the two peaks has a distinctively different spectrum , with a much larger hydrogen column density required to fit the data .",
    "this is suggestive of some kind of temporary obscuration of the ns surface .",
    "also , the dips in two bursts go below the pre - burst emission level , meaning part of the accretion flow is also obscured , or perhaps even disrupted .",
    "no dips are ever observed in the persistent emission outside a burst .",
    "we have explored several models to explain the dips , the qpo , and the peculiar accretion state in which they appear , including confining mechanisms on the ns surface , obscuration of the surface and inner accretion flow in a high - inclination system , and accretion instabilities borne out of the interaction between the accretion disc and the magnetosphere .",
    "although no single model can explain all the observables , we favour a two - channel accretion state , transitional between the soft and hard state .",
    "mass accretion onto the magnetic poles would allow for the burst to disturb the accretion flow even if the burst flux is sub - eddington .",
    "if the source is viewed at a low inclination , the temporary disruption of the polar accretion channel by the burst could then obscure the ns surface , which would cause the flux to go below its pre - burst level , and in some cases even the inner equatorial accretion flow .",
    "if the instability causing the qpo controlled the equatorial channel , the disappearance of the qpo in the deepest dips could also be explained .",
    "further investigation is necessary to develop this model beyond this qualitative picture .",
    "it remains to be seen whether such an accretion geometry could indeed be sustainable , confined to a very narrow range of accretion rates , and whether this scenario could reproduce the fairly long dips .",
    "the difficulty of constraining such a model notwithstanding , the obscuration that is responsible from the dip must be connected with the disc instability that is responsible for the qpo and the type ii bursts .",
    "we wish to thank diego altamirano , yuri cavecchi , jeroen homan , daniela huppenkothen and hauke worpel for useful discussions and occasional guidance offered during the preparation of this paper .",
