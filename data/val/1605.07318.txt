    "tissue remodelling in diverse developmental contexts , such as apical constriction in _ drosophila _ @xcite , or _ c. elegans _",
    "@xcite , cell intercalation during _ drosophila _ germ band extension @xcite , and xenopus extension and convergence @xcite have been observed to be associated with pulsation and flows of the medial actomyosin cytoskeleton .",
    "for instance , tissue extension in the _ drosophila _ embryo proceeds by the intercalation of cells , a so called t@xmath0-process , which starts with the step - wise shrinkage of a subset of cell junctions called ` vertical junctions ' ( aligned with the dorsal - ventral axis of the embryo ) driven by cortical myosin - ii .",
    "it was recently shown that each step of junctional shrinkage is driven by a medial - apical actomyosin pulse that flows towards this vertical junction @xcite . in this paper , we describe a general theory of the dynamics of spontaneous actomyosin pulsation and symmetry breaking flows , that should be applicable not only in the context of germ - band elongation , but also during other morphogenetic events .",
    "in addition , using germ band cells in the _ drosophila _ embryo as a model system , we provide experimental justification for the assumptions underlying our theoretical framework and verify many of its key predictions .",
    "the medial actin mesh modelled as an active elastomer embedded in a solvent is subject to active contractile stresses arising from the binding of myosin mini - filaments ( fig.[fig : schema]a ) @xcite .",
    "the actin mesh is connected to e - cadherin adhesion molecules at the cell junctions via molecular linkers such as @xmath1-catenin an actin binding protein @xcite and @xmath2-catenin which binds @xmath1-catenin and e - cadherin .",
    "viewing the high resolution time lapse images ( fig.[fig : schema]b ) or movies ( _ supplementary movies _ ) showing nucleation , growth , coalescence and flow of clusters of labeled myosin towards the cell junction in a _",
    "germ band cell , should immediately convince one of the utility of adopting a hydrodynamic approach .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for this active elastomer are derived from symmetry arguments and include minimal phenomenological inputs ( section ii ) .",
    "we describe the hydrodynamic modes in the overdamped limit @xcite and obtain phase diagrams by numerically solving the hydrodynamic equations ( section iii ) .",
    "we find that the active elastomer exhibits spontaneous oscillations , contractile instabilities and coarsening of clusters enriched in actomyosin .",
    "the coarsening often leads to stable actomyosin - dense clusters which , beyond a threshold , acquire a polarity .",
    "this results in a spontaneous movement as a spatially localised traveling front .",
    "such localised traveling front solutions appear in other excitable systems such as the fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite , to which our model bears a close resemblance . on the other hand , large myosin - induced contractile stresses ,",
    "can lead to _ nonaffine _ deformations due to actin turnover ( section iv ) .",
    "this results in a _ transient actin network _",
    ", that exhibits _ intranetwork flow _ of the actomyosin dense regions as a consequence of filament unbinding and rebinding .",
    "interestingly , the theory predicts that the driving force for spontaneous flow comes from the actomyosin - dense region itself and not the cell boundary - we provide robust experimental verification of this .",
    "while our hydrodynamic analysis is designed to be very general , the affine description should be seen as being closely related to the spring model of @xcite .",
    "our general perspective reveals several significantly new aspects and provides a fresh conceptual understanding of this ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "the hydrodynamic variables of the confined active elastomer are the actin mesh affine displacement field @xmath3 , the actin mesh density @xmath4 , the density of the bound myosin minifilaments @xmath5 , the junctional e - cadherin density @xmath6 and the hydrodynamic velocity @xmath7 ( fig.[fig : schema]a ) .    in the absence of flow and activity ,",
    "the system relaxes to equilibrium governed by a free - energy functional @xmath8 = \\int d{\\bf r } f_b$ ] , where @xmath9 is the the bulk elastic free energy density of the elastomer written in terms of the linearized strain tensor @xmath10 ( _ methods _ ) . in principle , we need to include a boundary contribution reflecting the soft anchoring arising from the actin - cadherin linkage ; for the present we simply include @xmath11 s contribution in the elastic moduli and hard boundary conditions on the dynamical equations .    in the presence of active processes ,",
    "the overdamped rouse dynamics are described by , @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 eq.([eq : mesh ] ) is a balance between frictional force experienced by the mesh ( with coefficient @xmath15 ) and the net force acting on the mesh , written in terms of the total stress @xmath16 ,    a sum of the elastic stress , @xmath17 , dissipative stress due to the viscosity ( @xmath18 ) of the elastomer network , @xmath19 , and the active stress    ^a = - ( , _ b , ) i",

    "eq.([eq : myosin ] ) describes the dynamics of bound myosin filament density from advection by the filament velocity @xmath25 and turnover @xmath26 by ( un)binding . we allow for a possible strain - induced unbinding with a hill - form , @xmath27 @xcite . similarly , eq.([eq : actin ] ) describes the dynamics of the actin mesh density including advection , permeation and actin turnover , taken to be @xmath28 .    in our analysis",
    "we have ignored the hydrodynamics of the fluid , this is suggested by experiments that show the movement of the actin mesh relative to the fluid does not advect particles suspended in the fluid unless they are bound to the actomyosin mesh @xcite . for completeness",
    "however , we display the full hydrodynamic equations in _ supplementary information ( si)_.    it is important to note that in writing eqs.([eq : mesh]-[eq : actin ] ) , we have tacitly taken the mesh deformations to be affine - i.e. , where the deformations are homogeneous over a spatially coarse - grained scale .",
    "this in particular implies that the deformation does not alter the local coordination number of the mesh .",
    "we will return to this important point later .",
    "even so there is a clear separation of time scales , which in increasing order correspond to the advection time scale , myosin turnover time and actin turnover time .",
    "we will first consider the case when the actin mesh density is `` fast '' compared to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the characteristic scale on which the mesh velocity , of typical magnitude @xmath31 , varies ) and the actin turnover time is long ; in this limit , the mesh density is slaved to the local compressive strain , thus with @xmath32 , we arrive at @xmath33 ( see _ methods _ ) .",
    "the conceptual features of the pulsation and flow are captured by a simple scalar version with one - elastic constant , @xmath34 .",
    "it helps to make the equations dimensionless by choosing length and time in units of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ; in these units @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are dimensionless .",
    "see _ methods _ for parameter values .",
    "we first do a linear stability analysis about the unstrained , homogeneous steady state . to this order , the active stress @xmath43 , with @xmath23 for contractility and @xmath44 . by going over to a plane wave basis @xmath45 ( where , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the system and mesh size , respectively ) and computing the two roots of the dispersion ( detailed calculations and phase diagram appear in the _ si _ ) ,        we deduce the following : ( i ) for low values of active stress compared to the elastic stiffness , @xmath49 , the elastic mesh is stable with dispersion @xmath50 , ( ii )",
    "as the contractile strength exceeds @xmath51 , the elastomer undergoes unstable oscillations with an amplitude that increases exponentially with time , ( iii ) at a threshold boundary , the elastomer supports a traveling wave solution with a speed @xmath52{\\l kdb^2/4\\r}$ ] , ( iv ) beyond an active stress @xmath53 , the elastomer contracts indefinitely .",
    "we find the qualitative features of the transitions remain unaltered when the strain - dependent unbinding parameter @xmath1 is varied , as long as @xmath54 .    in spite of the simplifying nature of the linear analysis",
    ", it captures some gross features and makes useful predictions : ( a ) the oscillatory behaviour or pulsation requires advection and myosin turnover @xcite , ( b ) the contractile instability is promoted by lowering elastic stiffness ( by reducing levels of @xmath2-catenin / cadherin ) @xcite or reducing myosin unbinding rates @xcite .",
    "the linear analysis however fails to capture the phenomenology of flowing configurations of actomyosin .",
    "it is possible that the oscillatory instability seen in the linear analysis would be tempered by nonlinearities in the dynamical equations - to lowest order these arise from the strain - dependent unbinding @xmath55 , advection , and active stress , which together constitute an excitatory - inhibitory system of equations leading to sustained spontaneous oscillations . to see this",
    ", we work in 1-dim , and after fourier transforming eqs.([eq : mesh]),([eq : myosin ] ) in a finite domain @xmath56 $ ] with neumann boundary conditions , retain only the smallest wavenumber , a 1-mode galerkin truncation , which accomodates the strain - dependent unbinding nonlinearity .",
    "the resulting coupled odes upon re - scaling describe a generalized van der pol oscillator @xcite with linear damping and cubic nonlinearities .",
    "this admits a limit cycle through a supercritical - hopf bifurcation for @xmath57 - a signature of the appearance of sustained spontaneous oscillations . at the onset of bifurcation",
    ", we use a fluctuation analysis to obtain the time period of oscillation @xmath58 . to see the effects of the _ advective nonlinearity _ , we need to extended the above mode - truncation analysis to 2-modes .",
    "the resulting 3-dimensional dynamical system exhibits , in addition to limit cycles , _ temporal chaos _ as seen by the algebraic decay of the power - spectrum , positive lyapunov exponent and denseness of the poincare section ( details will appear in @xcite ) .",
    "however , again including nonlinear effects using low order mode - truncation , fails to capture the phenomenology of flowing configurations of actomyosin . note that wave - like dispersion relations obtained from this truncated model are not a response to an external perturbation , but are _ self - generated_. this _ cell - autonomous _ behaviour is consistent with observations of pulsatile dynamics in medial actomyosin @xcite .",
    "we now study the effect of the nonlinearity arising from the active stress .",
    "this gives rise to a new set of solutions , namely the _ spatially localized traveling front _ solutions . to see this",
    ", we perform a numerical analysis of the full nonlinear equations in 1-dim .",
    "we first taylor expand @xmath21 in eq.([eq : activephen ] ) about @xmath59 , the mesh density in the unstrained configuration , and recast the the active stress as ^a = (_0 ) - ^(_0 ) + ^2 ^(_0 ) ^2 +  [ eq : sigmaa ] separating out the terms dependent on @xmath60 and only on @xmath5 , and combining the former with the elastic stress @xmath61 in eq.[eq : mesh ] , leads to an effective `` elastic free - energy '' , ( ) = k_2(_b , _ 0)^2 + k_3(_b , _ 0 ) ^3 + k_4(_0)^4 where the @xmath62 s are density dependent coefficients and we have included a quartic term with @xmath63 to ensure that the local compressive strain does not grow without bound , as a consequence of steric hinderance , filament rigidity or crosslinking myosin .",
    "the @xmath64 that emerges as a consequence of activity , has 3 new features : ( i ) for weak active stress , the minima at @xmath65 gets shallower , indicating that the elastic stiffness @xmath66 decreases , ( ii ) as we increase the active stress , there appears another minimum at @xmath67 ( iii ) for large active stresses , the @xmath65 state can be unstable , with the effective @xmath68 ( fig.s3a ) .",
    "the final 1-dim equations of motion are given by , [ eq : finalu ] & = & ^ ( ) + ^a(_b ) + [ eq : finalm ] & = & - ( _ b ) + d _ b + s_m ( , _ b ) [ eq : finala ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and myosin turnover @xmath71 .",
    "these equations are numerically solved with either periodic or neumann boundary conditions using a finite difference scheme ( _ methods _ ) .",
    "initial conditions are small amplitude random fluctuations about the homogeneous unstrained state .",
    "the numerical phase diagram , displayed in fig.[fig : numericalpd ] , shows several new features compared to the linear phase diagram , with direct relevance to experiments .",
    "this and a detailed confrontation with experiments are highlighted below .",
    "the two features that are expected to arise from nonlinear effects , namely , the tempering of the linear instabilities to obtain _ both _ finite - amplitude oscillatory and finite - amplitude contractile collapse phases at intermediate and high contractile stresses , respectively , show up in the steady state phase diagram , fig.[fig : numericalpd]a , b .",
    "the corresponding kymographs in the bound myosin density ( fig.[fig : numericalpd]d , h ) show the appearance of these steady state at late times .",
    "the time development of configurations in these phases can be summarized as follows - starting from a generic state with small random fluctuations about the homogeneous unstrained state , the configuration quickly results in a spatially heterogenous ( un)binding of myosin filaments onto the actin mesh , transiently generating localized compression .",
    "this will increase the local concentration of actin , which in turn will facilitate more myosin recruitment and hence more compression .",
    "this local compression will cause an elastic tug at the boundaries , enhancing the local strain , which can induce an enhanced myosin unbinding .",
    "if it does , this will lead to a relaxation of the compressed region , to be followed by another round of binding - compression - unbinding leading to the observed oscillations . in this spontaneous oscillating phase",
    ", the frequency gets smaller with increasing the active stress or decreasing unbinding rate @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if myosin unbinding does not occur fast enough , the elastomer will undergo a contractile instability , to be eventually stabilised by nonlinear effects such as steric hinderance and filament rigidity .",
    "in addition to this however , there is a wholly unexpected feature that emerges from a solution of the full nonlinear equations . in the parameter regime between the oscillatory and the contractile collapse phases",
    ", there appears a _ moving phase _ ( fig.[fig : numericalpd ] ) , where spatially localized actomyosin - dense regions ( which we later identify as traveling fronts ) spontaneously move to either the left or right boundary . in the regimes between the pure moving phase and the oscillatory and collapse phases ,",
    "lie the _ coexistence phases _ where the moving phase coexists with oscillations and collapse , respectively .",
    "the corresponding kymographs in the bound myosin density ( fig.[fig : numericalpd]e - g ) show the appearance of these steady state at late times . in the _ si _ we provide a simple explanation based on a time scale argument for the occurrence of these phase transitions .    in making direct quantitative comparisons of the phase transitions predicted by theory with that obtained from experiments at this stage",
    ", one should exercise some caution , for this requires an understanding of how theoretical quantities such as myosin unbinding rates , mesh stiffness and active contractile stress , depend on experimentally accessible parameters such as phospho - cycling of myosin regulatory light chain @xcite , or the strength and density of actin crosslinkers .",
    "typically , altering experimental accessible parameters will affect more than one theoretical parameter , and will thus trace out a trajectory in this theoretical phase diagram .",
    "nevertheless one can make several qualitative assertions based on the theory .",
    "some are immediate , such as ( i ) the existence of bounded ( finite - amplitude ) oscillations requires _ both _ strain - dependent unbinding and turnover of myosin , ( ii ) the coexisting oscillation - moving and collapse - moving phases can not be obtained in the absence of strain - dependent unbinding , ( iii ) advection is a necessary condition for front movement .    we will now explore the relationship between the spontaneous moving phase predicted in this affine theory , and the actomyosin flows seen in - vivo , in terms of the shape of the actomyosin - dense region , the onset of movement , the driving force for movement and its dynamics .",
    "in the moving regime , the effective ` elastic free - energy ' functional @xmath64 develops a second minima at @xmath72 corresponding to a local compression due to contractility ( fig.s3a ) .",
    "the initiation of flow starts with the binding of myosin onto regions where the local actin density is high , leading to an eventual nucleation of actomyosin - dense regions , which subsequently grow and coalesce to form larger actomyosin - dense regions .",
    "this is best seen using a space - time analysis of eqs.[eq : finalu]-[eq : finala ] with initial conditions stated above .",
    "kymographs of the spatial profile of bound myosin density , calculated from the theory , show nucleation and growth ( @xmath73 ) followed by coalescence ( @xmath74 ) and eventual flow ( @xmath75 ) ( fig.[fig : kymograph]a , b ) .",
    "this space - time behaviour accurately recapitulates the dynamics of medial myosin in - vivo as seen from the experimental kymographs , fig.[fig : kymograph]c , d .          what prompts the actomyosin - dense region to flow ?",
    "we study the configuration of the localized actomyosin - dense region before the flow commences , and find that it assumes a symmetric localized profile ( fig.[fig : flux]a ) within which the strain @xmath67 ( the second minimum ) where @xmath76 .",
    "the active stress in this region is higher than out , this gradient in stress should induce inflowing myosin currents from either side of it .",
    "we verify this by monitoring the fluxes @xmath77 and @xmath78 , coming from the left and right of this symmetric profile . over time , owing to stochasticity either in the initial conditions or the dynamics , there is a net flux , @xmath79 , from either the left or the right ( fig.[fig : flux]b ) , leading an asymmetric profile ( fig.[fig : flux]c ) , and hence gradient of @xmath5 across the profile .",
    "this marks the onset of the traveling front .",
    "this exactly replicates the situation in - vivo , as seen in fig.[fig : flux]d - f .",
    "our theory predicts that the myosin - dense cluster starts to flow only when it has attained an asymmetric density profile , whereupon it moves as a traveling front , with a constant velocity while maintaining its shape ( as long as there are no further coalescence events ) .",
    "we confirm this using a variety of initial conditions or the bound myosin density @xmath5 , including starting with a single symmetric gaussian profile .",
    "we analyze the asymmetric profile of the traveling front by transforming to the co - moving frame @xmath80 ( fig.[fig : anatomy ] ) .",
    "we find that within the traveling front , the strain takes a value slightly more compressed relative to @xmath81 , the value of the strain at the second minima , where @xmath82 .",
    "the traveling front is stably compressed in a force - free state ( fig.[fig : anatomy]a , b ) .",
    "the asymmetric myosin profile gives rise to a gradient in the active stress ( fig.[fig : anatomy]c ) , which provides the propulsive force for the traveling front to move to the right in fig.[fig : anatomy]c .",
    "the fact that the flowing actomyosin - dense region commences to move when it has attained an asymmetric profile , moves with a constant velocity in the direction where the leading edge has the smoother slope and maintains its asymmetric shape as it moves , exactly replicates the situation in - vivo , as seen in fig.[fig : anatomy]d - f .",
    "the dynamics of the traveling front that emerges from our theory is local , its propulsion is therefore independent of the boundary or the distance from the boundary .",
    "we ask whether this is true of the flowing actomyosin - dense regions in - vivo .",
    "figure[fig : drivingforce]a shows that irrespective of its initial position at the commencement of the flow , the moving actomyosin - dense region travels to the left or right cell boundary with equal probability .",
    "further , fig.[fig : drivingforce]b shows that the moving actomyosin - dense region travels with a constant velocity as it moves towards a given cell boundary , its speed does not depend on the distance from the cell boundary .    to emphasize this point",
    ", we calculate the velocity of the traveling front by integrating eqs.([eq : finalu]-[eq : finalm ] ) across the scale @xmath83 of the traveling front in the co - moving frame .",
    "this leads to the formula , @xmath84 , which states that the velocity depends only on the shape asymmetry of the front ; if the shape is maintained over time , then the velocity is a constant . in fig.[fig : drivingforce]c , we plot the @xmath85 versus the velocity and show that they are proportional to each other over a large range of active and elastic stresses .",
    "does this relation hold in the in - vivo context ?",
    "rather than extracting @xmath85 from the myosin intensity , we compute the shape - asymmetry via the skewness , @xmath86 , of the myosin profile .",
    "the comparison between the theoretical prediction and in - vivo experiment is striking ( fig.[fig : drivingforce]d ) .    to our mind",
    ", this establishes unambiguously that the flow towards the junctions is spontaneous with the driving force coming from the gradient in myosin established within the front .",
    "the boundary does not affect the flow speed , at best , weak asymmetries that may arise at the boundary ( for instance due to an asymmetry in functional cadherin ) may bias the direction of the flow @xcite .",
    "one consequence of this is that a traveling front moving to the right , might reverse its direction following a coalescence with another traveling front ( fig.s5a ) .",
    "figures5b - d shows examples of such reversals observed in in - vivo experiments .",
    "it is important to note that the movement of the actomyosin - dense region arising from affine deformations of the active elastomer is a moving _ deformation _ of the actomyosin mesh , and once established , is not contingent on myosin turnover , as shown in fig[fig : massflow]a .",
    "one could also sustain a traveling front or moving deformation of the actomyosin mesh by ensuring differential myosin binding unbind rates at the leading and trailing edges of the front , in a kind of _ treadmilling _ movement , fig[fig : massflow]b .",
    "none of these however is associated with mass flow of actin and myosin .",
    "preliminary experiments show loss of recovery on performing a frap on a small region within the actomyosin - dense cluster @xcite , suggesting the possibility of actual mass flow .",
    "to realise this within the active elastomer description , we should first recognise that when the local contractile stresses are large , the deformation on the mesh may no longer be affine , and one needs a description of _ nonaffine _ deformations of the active elastomer .",
    "the following picture helps understand the origins of nonaffineness .",
    "consider a disordered mesh comprising actin filaments linked to each other by crosslinkers such as @xmath1-actinin and myosin ( we will assume that this is an _ unentangled _ network ) .",
    "the bound myosin locally compresses the mesh here and there , recruiting more myosin in the process .",
    "when the local bound myosin concentration goes beyond a threshold ( so that the configuration now samples the second minimum of the effective free energy , @xmath64 ) , the local compression is high and the regions surrounding this myosin - dense region get significantly stretched .",
    "this could lead to a breaking ( or ripping ) of the mesh , either via the unbinding of crosslinkers or by the sliding and slipping of filaments past each other . within the active elastomer framework , this can be accounted for by turnover of actin and crosslinkers .",
    "this mesh breakage subsequently heals by the rebinding of the crosslinkers or actin itself .    with this in mind",
    ", we refer to several seminal studies on thermally activated reversibly crosslinked networks in the context of the dynamic properties of _ physical gels _",
    "the most dramatic feature of such reversible networks is its _ internal fluidity _",
    ", where each chain can diffuse through the entire network due to the finiteness of the crosslinker life time , in spite of being partially connected to the macroscopic network structure in the course of movement .",
    "these systems thus flow under an external stress on time scales longer than the crosslinker dissociation time ( see , @xcite in the context of actin mesh ) .    in the present context ,",
    "when the local bound myosin concentration rises beyond a threshold and attains an asymmetric density profile , it induces mesh breakage in its surrounding regions .",
    "this actomyosin - dense region can move through the entire network due to the finiteness of the crosslinker life time , in spite of being partially connected to the macroscopic network structure in the course of movement .",
    "these systems should thus exhibit _ flow _ under an internal active contractile stresses on time scales longer than the crosslinker dissociation time .",
    "this is depicted in fig[fig : massflow]c .    to describe this mathematically",
    ", it is convenient to define physical quantities coarse - grained over the scale of the actomyosin - dense region @xmath87 , such as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the net force - dipole associated with the anisotropy of the myosin profile ( note we now have to work in @xmath90 ) .",
    "we may decompose myosin density configuration @xmath91 into a sum of actomyosin - dense clumps ( contributing to nonaffine deformations ) and a background ( contributing to affine deformations ) , with volume fractions @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the equation for the @xmath91 may now be written as , = - |_b * v * + d ( 1- ) ^2 |_b + s_m(|_b ) [ eq : omegaav ] where , @xmath94 , and @xmath2 is the mesh breakage probability and @xmath95 is a proportionality constant .",
    "flow described here is a consequence of internal active deformations in a transient actomyosin network .",
    "we believe this is a new physical phenomenon , an active version of the flow observed in physical gels under external load .",
    "a more complete theory of nonaffine deformations of a transient actomyosin network is a task for the future .",
    "although highly simplified , in that it has completely ignored the coupling of actomyosin dynamics to local chemical signalling such as rho @xcite , we believe this active elastomer model with strain - dependent turnover of components , admitting _ both _ affine and nonaffine deformations , captures the essential physics of actomyosin pulsation and flows observed in a wide variety of tissue remodelling contexts such as _ drosophila _ germ band extension and dorsal closure in the amnioserosa .",
    "the minimal ingredients for actomyosin pulsation and flow are mesh - elasticity , actomyosin contractility , advection and turnover of both myosin and actin .",
    "while sustained oscillations would be expected from a model of an active elastomer , the occurrence of spontaneous , symmetry breaking flows via a shape - preserving profile is rather unexpected .    in this study",
    ", we have modelled the medial actin mesh during apical constriction and germ band extension in the _ drosophila _ embryo as an active elastomer embedded in a solvent @xcite , rather than as an active fluid , as has been successfully done in the context of _ c. elegans _",
    "embryo @xcite .",
    "there are several empirical reasons for doing this - ( i ) the pulsation of medial actomyosin in these systems is correlated with the oscillations in the area of the apical surface @xcite , ( ii ) modulating the strength of the coupling of medial actin to the junction via @xmath2-catenin affects the pulsation , and ( iii ) turnover time of actin is not small .    to make a detailed comparison of the spatiotemporal actomyosin patterns with experiments generated using quantitative imaging , we will need to extend this numerical study to 2-dimensions , using appropriate ( anisotropic ) boundary conditions and allowing for shear .",
    "the nucleation and growth of the actomyosin - rich domains are similar to that seen in 1-dim , with the difference being that domains can move around each other in 2dim and can exhibit anisotropic movement .        in future",
    ", we would like to extend this framework to understand the dynamical coupling of the medial actomyosin with degrees of freedom ( concentration of e - cadherin ) attached to a deformable cell junction . though the emergence of actomyosin flows does not depend on specific boundary conditions , cell boundaries",
    "may directionally bias the intrinsic ability of actomyosin networks to generate flow , as proposed before @xcite .",
