    "the transport of phonons in mesoscale and nanoscale devices is an important issue relevant to the questions of heat generation in devices and their structural stability .",
    "experiments measuring the heat generated in electric current - carrying metal - molecule junctions found that the generated heat can be substantial @xcite and can therefore threaten the device s integrity .",
    "efficiently dissipating heat in such devices is thus important and a problem that must be considered .",
    "a way of manipulating heat in nanoscale devices is by utilizing a heat pump that directs heat from one part of the device to another or to an external reservoir by means of an applied external work .",
    "models on the mechanism of such a nanoscale heat pump have been proposed in systems where the pump works against the thermal gradient between two reservoirs in the system @xcite and in systems where there is no net thermal bias between the two reservoirs @xcite .",
    "in addition , other models employing quantum particle pumps that differentiate and filter hot and cold particles have been proposed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present an alternative model of a phonon pump that directs energy , and thus heat , into or out of regions of the device by dynamically modulating the coupling between those regions .",
    "the model is different from previous models of heat pumps where requirements of either modulating the temperatures of reservoirs @xcite , or having an external driving force acting at the central portion of the device @xcite , or filtering particles according to their temperatures @xcite should be satisfied .",
    "our model , in comparison , requires an external agent that can either absorb or release heat and is dynamically modulating the coupling between two parts of the device .",
    "a thermal gradient is not necessary for our model phonon pump to work .    to induce a phonon pump action in our model",
    "the coupling between the two parts of the system is harmonically modulated in time .",
    "experimentally , this can be done by , for example , harmonically varying the distance between two molecules , therefore modulating the coupling between the molecules .",
    "time - dependent transport of phonons in molecular systems , however , is a topic that is not yet fully understood theoretically .",
    "although our understanding of the subject has improved tremendously during the past few years , most of the results pertain to steady - state and long - time behavior @xcite .",
    "time - dependent phonon transport with non - adiabatic and strong perturbations has recently been studied in a thermal switch device where the coupling to the reservoirs is abruptly turned on @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the thermal switch model to one where the reservoir coupling is modulated in time .",
