    "lifshitz spacetimes have received considerable attention from the condensed matter point of view due to the ads / cft correspondence , i.e. , searching for gravity duals of lifshitz fixed points for condensed matter physics and quantum chromodynamics @xcite . from the quantum field theory point of view , there are many invariant scale theories of interest when studying such critical points .",
    "such theories exhibit the anisotropic scale invariance @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the relative scale dimension of time and space , and these are of particular interest in studies of critical exponent theory and phase transitions .",
    "systems with such behavior appear , for instance , in the description of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "the importance of possessing a tool to study strongly correlated condensed matter systems is beyond question , and consequently much attention has focused on this area in recent years .",
    "one of the most well studied systems in the context of gauge / gravity duality , is the holographic superconductor . in its simplest form ,",
    "the gravity sector is a gravitating system with a cosmological constant , a gauge field and a charged scalar field with a potential .",
    "the dynamics of the system defines a critical temperature above which the system finds itself in its normal phase and the scalar field does not have any dynamics . below the critical temperature the system undergoes a phase transition to a new configuration . from the gravity side",
    "this is interpretated as the black hole to acquire hair while from boundary conformal field theory site this is interpretated as a condensation of the scalar field and the system enters a superconducting phase . in this sense ,",
    "lifshitz holographic superconductivity has been a topic of numerous studies and interesting properties are found when one generalizes the gauge / gravity duality to non - relativistic situations @xcite .",
    "the lifshitz spacetimes are described by the metrics @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents a @xmath7 dimensional spatial vector , @xmath8 is the spacetime dimension and @xmath9 denotes the length scale in the geometry . if @xmath10 , the spacetime is the usual anti - de sitter metric in poincar coordinates .",
    "furthermore , all scalar curvature invariants are constant and these spacetimes have a null curvature singularity at @xmath11 for @xmath12 , which can be seen by computing the tidal forces between infalling particles .",
    "this singularity is reached in finite proper time by infalling observers , so the spacetime is geodesically incomplete @xcite .",
    "the metrics of lifshitz black holes asymptotically have the form ( [ lif1 ] ) ; however , obtaining analytical solutions does not seem to be a trivial task , and therefore constructing finite temperature gravity duals requires the introduction of strange matter content with a theoretical motivation that is not clear .",
    "another way of finding such a lifshitz black hole solution is by considering carefully - tuned higher - curvature modifications to the hilbert - einstein action , as in new massive gravity ( nmg ) in 3-dimensions or @xmath13 corrections to general relativity .",
    "this has been done , for instance , in ayonbeato:2009nh , cai:2009ac , ayonbeato:2010tm , dehghani:2010kd .",
    "a 4-dimensional topological black hole with @xmath14 was found in @xcite and a set of analytic lifshitz black holes in higher dimensions for arbitrary @xmath4 in @xcite .",
    "lifshitz black holes with arbitrary dynamical exponent in horndeski theory were found in @xcite and non - linearly charged lifshitz black holes for any exponent @xmath15 in @xcite .",
    "thermodynamically , it is difficult to compute conserved quantities for lifshitz black holes ; however , progress was made on the computation of mass and related thermodynamic quantities by using the adt method @xcite as well as the euclidean action approach @xcite .",
    "also , phase transitions between lifshitz black holes and other configurations with different asymptotes have been studied in @xcite . however , due to their different asymptotes these phases transitions do not occur .",
    "conformal gravity is a four - derivative theory and is perturbatively renormalizable @xcite .",
    "also , it contains ghost - like modes in the form of massive spin-2 excitations .",
    "however , a solution to the ghost problem in fourth order derivative theories was shown in @xcite by using the method of dirac constraints @xcite to quantize the pais - uhlenbeck fourth order oscillator model @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider a matter distribution outside the event horizon of the lifshitz black hole in @xmath16-dimensions in conformal gravity with a spherical transverse section and dynamical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath0 the previously mentioned anisotropic scale invariance corresponds to space - like scale invariance with no transformation of time .",
    "the matter is parameterized by scalar fields minimally and conformally coupled to gravity .",
    "then , we obtain analytically and numerically the quasinormal frequencies ( qnfs ) @xcite for scalar fields , after which we study their stability under scalar perturbations . also , we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients and the absorption cross section .",
    "the study of the qnfs gives information about the stability of black holes under matter fields that evolve perturbatively in their exterior region , without backreacting on the metric .",
    "in general , the oscillation frequencies are complex , where the real part represents the oscillation frequency and the imaginary part describes the rate at which this oscillation is damped , with the stability of the black hole being guaranteed if the imaginary part is negative .",
    "the qnfs are independent of the initial conditions and depend only on the parameters of the black hole ( mass , charge and angular momentum ) and the fundamental constants ( newton constant and cosmological constant ) that describe a black hole , just like the parameters that define the test field . on the other hand ,",
    "the qnfs determine how fast a thermal state in the boundary theory will reach thermal equilibrium according to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , where the relaxation time of a thermal state is proportional to the inverse of the imaginary part of the qnfs of the dual gravity background , which was established due to the qnfs of the black hole being related to the poles of the retarded correlation function of the corresponding perturbations of the dual conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "fermions on a lifshitz background were studied in @xcite by using the fermionic green s function in 4-dimensional lifshitz spacetime with @xmath14 ; the authors considered a non - relativistic ( mixed ) boundary condition for fermions and showed that the spectrum has a flat band .",
    "also , the dirac quasinormal modes ( qnms ) for a 4-dimensional lifshitz black hole were studied in @xcite .",
    "generally , the lifshitz black holes are stable under scalar perturbations , and the qnfs show the absence of a real part @xcite .",
    "the qnfs have been calculated by means of numerical and analytical techniques , some remarkably numerical methods are : the mashhoon method , chandrasekhar - detweiler , wkb method , frobenius method , method of continued fractions , nollert , asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) and improved aim among others . in the context of black hole thermodynamics ,",
    "qnms allow the quantum area spectrum of the black hole horizon to be studied @xcite as well as the mass and the entropy spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , knowledge of black holes perturbations is also useful for studying the hawking radiation , which is a semiclassical effect and gives the thermal radiation emitted by a black hole . at the event horizon ,",
    "the hawking radiation is in fact blackbody radiation .",
    "however , this radiation still has to traverse a non - trivial curved spacetime geometry before reaching a distant observer that can detect it .",
    "the surrounding spacetime thus works as a potential barrier for the radiation , giving a deviation from the blackbody radiation spectrum , seen by an asymptotic observer @xcite .",
    "thus the total flux observed at infinity is that of a @xmath8-dimensional greybody at the hawking temperature .",
    "the factors that modify the spectrum emitted by a black hole are known as greybody factors and can be obtained through the classical scattering ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this sense ,",
    "the scalar greybody factors for an asymptotically lifshitz black hole were studied in @xcite , and particle motion on these geometries in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief review of the @xmath16-dimensional lifshitz black hole in conformal gravity . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the qnfs of scalar perturbations for the @xmath16-dimensional lifshitz black hole with spherical topology and @xmath0 for some special cases analytically and numerically by using the improved aim .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iv , we study the reflection and transmission coefficients and the absorption cross section",
    ". finally , our conclusions are in sec . v.",
    "in this work we consider a matter distribution described by a scalar field outside the event horizon of a four - dimensional asymptotically lifshitz black hole in conformal gravity with @xmath0 and spherical topology for the transverse section @xcite .",
    "conformal gravity is a limit case of einstein - weyl gravity .",
    "the action of einstein - weyl gravity is given by @xmath17where @xmath18@xmath19 is the ricci scalar and @xmath20 is the cosmological constant .",
    "when @xmath21 goes to infinity we have the special case of conformal gravity , and the field equations in vacuum are given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the bach tensor defined by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the weyl tensor .",
    "the following metric solves the field equations @xcite @xmath26for @xmath27 , there is an event horizon at the largest root of @xmath28 , given by @xmath29and for @xmath30 the singularity is naked .",
    "note that the requirement @xmath31 implies that @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath33 the solution becomes extremal , and for @xmath34 the entropy vanishes in this case . the kretschmann scalar ( for @xmath34 )",
    "is given by @xmath35 therefore , there is a curvature singularity at @xmath36 . in the next section ,",
    "we determine the qnfs by considering the klein - gordon equation in this background and by establishing the boundary conditions on the scalar field at the horizon and at spatial infinity .",
    "the qnms of scalar perturbations in the background of a four - dimensional asymptotically lifshitz black hole in conformal gravity with dynamical exponent @xmath0 are given by the scalar field solution of klein - gordon equation with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "this means there are only ingoing waves on the event horizon and we consider that the scalar field vanishes at spatial infinity , known as dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "these fields are considered as mere test fields , without backreaction over the spacetime itself .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary for such fields to have the same symmetries as the background spacetime . on the other hand ,",
    "if one considers the backreaction of the matter fields over the spacetime , in order to look for exact solutions to the field equations , the relation between symmetries of the spacetime and the matter fields is not trivial , for a recent study about symmetry inheritance of scalar fields see @xcite and references therein . in the case considered here , the gravitational field equations imply that the trace of the stress - energy tensor must vanish , due to the bach tensor is traceless , therefore if one go beyond the probe - field approximation , this implies that the stress - energy tensor of the matter fields must be traceless .",
    "based on these arguments , first we will consider a test scalar field minimally coupled to curvature , then we will consider a test scalar field conformally coupled to curvature , which have a traceless stress - energy tensor , and we find analytically and numerically the quasinormal frequencies for scalar fields for some special cases .      in this section",
    "we calculate the qnms of the @xmath0 lifshitz black hole for a test scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the klein - gordon equation in curved spacetime is @xmath37where @xmath38 is the mass of the scalar field @xmath39 , which is minimally coupled to curvature . by means of the following ansatz",
    "@xmath40where @xmath41 is a normalizable harmonic function on the two - sphere which satisfies @xmath42 being @xmath43 the eigenvalues for the spheric manifold , with @xmath44  , the klein - gordon equation reduces to @xmath45now , by considering @xmath46 and by introducing the tortoise coordinate @xmath47 , given by @xmath48 , the latter equation can be rewritten as a one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath49 k(r_{\\ast } ) = 0~,\\]]where the effective potential is given by @xmath50 ~.\\]]in fig .",
    "( [ potential1 ] ) we plot the effective potential for @xmath51 and in fig .  ( [ potential0 ] ) for @xmath52 and different values of the parameter @xmath53 .",

    "( [ q ] ) , we plot @xmath69 as a function of @xmath70 and we observe that @xmath69 can be positive or negative depending on the values of @xmath71the parameter @xmath72 : @xmath73     as a function of @xmath70.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    on the other hand , equation ( [ rad ] ) can be manipulated and put into the following form @xmath74 we note that for @xmath75 this equation corresponds to a riemann differential equation , whose general form is @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the singular points , and the exponents @xmath79 and @xmath80 are subject to the condition @xmath81 the complete solution is denoted by the symbol @xmath82 and the riemann @xmath83 function can be reduced to the hypergeometric function through @xmath84 where the @xmath83 function is now gauss hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "we observe that , in the radial equation ( [ ecradial ] ) , the regular singular points @xmath77 and @xmath78 have the values @xmath85 and the exponents are given by @xmath86 therefore , the solution to equation ( [ ecradial ] ) can be written as @xmath87 where we have defined the constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 as @xmath90 in the near - horizon limit , the above expression behaves as @xmath91 now , we impose as a boundary condition that classically nothing can escape from the event horizon .",
    "so , choosing the exponent @xmath92 as @xmath93 implies that we must take @xmath94 in order to have only ingoing waves at the horizon .",
    "therefore , our solution simplifies to @xmath95 now , we implement boundary conditions at spatial infinity . in order to do",
    "so we employ the kummer relations @xcite , and write the solution as @xmath96 at the limit @xmath97 , the above solution becomes @xmath98 now , we choose the exponents @xmath99 and @xmath80 as follows @xmath100 so , imposing the condition that the scalar field be null at spatial infinity , we can determine the qnfs .",
    "the second term of equation ( [ infinity ] ) blows up when @xmath97 unless we impose the condition @xmath101 or @xmath102 ; therefore , we obtain the following set of qnfs : @xmath103 these qnfs are purely imaginary and negative for @xmath104 , which guarantees that the lifshitz black hole is stable under massless scalar field perturbations for the mode with the lowest angular momentum . for @xmath105 there are qnfs with imaginary and positive value , and the lifshitz black hole is unstable under scalar field perturbations . also , we note that if we interchange the values of the exponents in equation ( [ gammas ] ) the same qnfs are obtained .",
    "it is worth mentioning that eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) with @xmath52 can be written as @xmath106 under the change of variable @xmath107 , and if we define @xmath108 , the above equation leads to the hypergeometric equation @xmath109f'(z)-ab f(z)=0~,\\ ] ] where @xmath110 @xmath111 and the constants are given by @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 the general solution of the hypergeometric equation  ( [ hypergeometric ] ) is @xmath115 and it has three regular singular points at @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath116 .",

    "@xmath117 is a hypergeometric function and @xmath132 and @xmath133 are constants .",

    "so , by imposing that only ingoing waves existing at the horizon , this fixes @xmath141 .",
    "the radial solution then becomes @xmath142 to implement boundary conditions at infinity ( @xmath10 ) , we apply kummer s formula for the hypergeometric function @xcite , @xmath143 where , @xmath144 @xmath145 with this expression , the radial function  ( [ horizonsolution ] ) reads @xmath146 and at infinity it can be written as @xmath147 so , for @xmath148 , the field at infinity vanishes if @xmath149 or @xmath150 for @xmath151 , and for @xmath152 , the field at infinity vanishes if @xmath153 or @xmath154 . therefore , the qnfs are given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 .",

    "in this work we calculated the qnfs of scalar field perturbations for the four - dimensional asymptotically lifshitz black hole in conformal gravity with a spherical topology and dynamical exponent @xmath0 , where the anisotropic scale invariance corresponds to a space - like scale invariance with no transformation of time , for some special cases that depend on @xmath69 , and by imposing suitable boundary conditions at spatial infinity .",
    "these scalar fields are considered as mere test fields , without backreaction over the spacetime itself .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary for such fields to have the same symmetries as the background spacetime .",
    "however , if one considers the backreaction of the matter fields over the spacetime , the relation between the symmetries of the spacetime and the matter fields is not trivial . for conformal gravity",
    "the gravitational field equations imply that the trace of the stress - energy tensor must vanish due to the bach tensor is traceless .",
    "firstly , we analyzed massive scalar field perturbations minimally coupled to curvature , which does not have the same symmetries as the background spacetime due to the trace of stress - energy tensor is not null .",
    "the first case studied corresponds to a scalar field without angular momentum ( @xmath52 ) , and we found that there is a spectrum of quasinormal frequencies for which the scalar field becomes null at spatial infinity .",
    "these frequencies are purely imaginary and negative for @xmath104 ; however , for @xmath237 some qnfs are imaginary and positive .",
    "another case we analyzed corresponds to @xmath120 , where we found a spectrum of qnfs that respect the dirichlet boundary condition ; however , some of them have a positive imaginary part .",
    "therefore , the black hole is unstable under massive scalar field perturbations and stable under massless scalar field perturbations .",
    "also , we analyzed the extremal case @xmath158 , for which we found that there are no qnms as in @xcite , where the authors demonstrated the absence of qnms in the extremal btz black hole .",
    "however , it was shown that it is possible to construct the qnms of three - dimensional extremal black holes algebraically as the descendants of the highest weight modes @xcite , with hidden conformal symmetry being an intrinsic property of the extremal black hole .",
    "also , it is worth mentioning that qnms for extremal black holes are not always absent , for instance see @xcite , where the authors reported the presence of qnms for extremal btz black holes in topologically massive gravity .    on the other hand ,",
    "because the gravitational field equations imply that the trace of the stress - energy tensor must vanish , we also considered scalar field perturbations conformally coupled to curvature which have a traceless stress - energy tensor , and we showed that the imaginary part of the qnfs calculated is negative , what guaranties the stability of the lifshitz black hole under conformally coupled scalar field perturbations , this was shown by using the improved aim and analytical solutions .",
    "this behavior is similar to the studied in @xcite for a three - dimensional lifshitz black hole in conformal gravity .    finally , we focused our attention to the minimally coupled scalar field case and we computed the reflection and transmission coefficients and the absorption cross section , and we showed numerically that the absorption cross section vanishes at the low and high frequency limits .",
    "therefore , a wave emitted from the horizon , with low or high frequency , does not reach the spatial infinity and is totally reflected , because the fraction of particles penetrating the potential barrier vanishes . however , we have shown there is a range of frequencies where the absorption cross section is not null .",
    "the reflection coefficient is 1 at the low frequency limit and for the high frequency limit this coefficient is null , with the behavior of the transmission coefficient being opposite with @xmath238 .",
    "also , we have shown that the absorption cross section increases if the mass of the scalar field decreases in the low frequency limit ; however , beyond a certain value of the frequency the absorption cross section does not depend on the mass of the scalar field .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the absorption cross section does not depend on the angular momentum .",
