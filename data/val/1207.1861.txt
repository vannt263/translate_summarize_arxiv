    "recently , the nonequilibrium dynamics of the zero and one - dimensional strongly - correlated systems attracts much attention due to the requirements of explaining a wide range of experiments in a variety of real materials . in spite of the intense efforts ,",
    "the nonequilibrium 0d and 1d systems still reject a full understanding , due to the lack of a reliable numerical or analytical tool of solving the schrdinger equation beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "the attempts of tackling this problem result in a lot of new nonequilibrium methods .",
    "most of them are based on the developments of their corresponding versions for the equilibrium systems .",
    "the examples include the real time quantum monte carlo  @xcite , the time - dependent numerical renormalization group  @xcite , the scattering state numerical renormalization group  @xcite , the adaptive time - dependent density matrix renormalization group  @xcite , the scattering bethe - ansatz  @xcite , the method based on integrability  @xcite , the real - time renormalization group  @xcite , the real time functional renormalization group  @xcite and the nonequilibrium flow equation  @xcite . however , no unique method is available which can both give the results in a high precision and incorporate the physics of the problem throughout the whole parameter space .",
    "it is still necessary to study new methods .",
    "a usual way of driving an equilibrium system out of equilibrium is by a quantum quench , that is to switch on a hamiltonian @xmath0 which is not commutative with the density matrix of the system at time @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics of a physical quantity is studied by calculating the expectation value of the corresponding operator with respect to the solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "recently , the author  @xcite suggested a different way of studying the nonequilibrium dynamics by solving the heisenberg equation of motion with the excitation operators . by decomposing the observable operator into the linear combination of a series of excitation operators",
    ", we circumvent the expansion of the s - matrix in solving the heisenberg equation .",
    "this method can be applied in the strongly - correlated systems beyond the perturbation theory .    in this paper , we develop a modified version of the excitation operator method and use it to study the spin dynamics in the one - dimensional @xmath2 model , which is an important paradigm of the low dimensional magnetism .",
    "the spin dynamics in a 1d system has been a field of active study for a long time  @xcite .",
    "there are still several open questions remaining to be settled .",
    "one of them is whether an integrable system in the gapped phase exhibits a ballistic spin transport at all temperatures  @xcite .",
    "we contribute to this question by giving a negative answer .",
    "we find that the spin transport in the gapped phase is diffusive at the high temperature limit , contrary to the gapless phase .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the excitation operator method . in sec .",
    "iii we define an orthonormal basis of the operator space in the spin-1/2 systems .",
    "the modified excitation operator method will be shown in sec .",
    "iv , and the results of the spin dynamics in the @xmath2 chain will be discussed in sec .",
    "v. we comment on the method in sec .",
    "up to now , the analytical and numerical methods for studying the strongly - correlated system focus on constructing the quantum state , including the ground state , the density matrix at finite temperature and the time - dependent state in nonequilibrium .",
    "they reach to the target by either assuming an ansatz of the needed state or approaching gradually to it in a process of thinning out of degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian . in these methods",
    "the fact is neglected that the quantum state contains all the information of the system , much more than what we need to calculate a physical quantity , especially a local one .",
    "therefore , a question naturally arises : is it easier to calculate a local physical quantity than to construct the full state of the system ?    in this paper we study the evolution of a physical observable in a strongly - correlated system driven out of equilibrium by solving the heisenberg equation of motion : @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the observable operator .",
    "we solve this equation by means of constructing the excitation operators .",
    "the excitation operator of a hamiltonian @xmath0 is an operator @xmath5 satisfying @xmath6 = \\lambda \\hat a,\\ ] ] where the real number @xmath7 denotes the excitation energy . to solve the heisenberg equation of motion ,",
    "we first decompose the observable operator into the linear combination of a series of excitation operators .",
    "such a decomposition has been proved to always exist ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "since the evolution of the excitation operator is trivial as @xmath8 , we could then get the evolution of the observable operator .",
    "at last we calculate the expectation value of the operator @xmath9 with respect to the initial quantum state at time @xmath1 .",
    "to do so , we must be aware of the initial state beforehand , which is often set to be an equilibrium state and can be got by the different numerical or analytical methods designed for equilibrium systems .",
    "we obtain the excitation operators by the method of undetermined coefficients .",
    "we decompose the excitation operators into the linear combination of a set of operators , which form the basis of the operator space .",
    "we denote the basis operators as @xmath10 .",
    "then we calculate the commutator between the hamiltonian and these basis operators .",
    "the result is generally expressed in a matrix form as @xmath11 = \\sum_j \\mathcal{h}_{j , i } \\hat o_j,\\ ] ] now we suppose that an excitation operator @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath13 substituting eqs .  [ defbasisop ] and  [ defexinbasis ] into eq .",
    "[ defexcitationop ] , we obtain @xmath14 so the coefficients of @xmath5 is an eigenvector of the matrix @xmath15 with the eigenvalue @xmath16 denoting the excitation energy .",
    "these coefficients can be obtained by an arbitrary diagonalization algorithm .",
    "the critical step of our approach is the choice of the basis of the operator space . since the operator space",
    "should whatever contain the observable operator , a natural way to choose the basis is to take the @xmath4 itself as the first element of the basis .",
    "we then calculate the commutator @xmath17 $ ] , which will generate new operators beyond @xmath4 .",
    "these operators are then included in the basis operators .",
    "we repeatedly calculate the commutators between the hamiltonian and the operators in the basis , until enough number of basis operators are obtained .",
    "however , in the basis obtained by this way one can not guarantee that the matrix @xmath15 will be a real symmetric matrix , and then does not know if it is diagonalizable .",
    "this problem can be solved by constructing a set of `` orthogonal '' basis operators .",
    "like what we do in a vector space , we could define an inner product between two operators , written as @xmath18 .",
    "the inner product should satisfy all the properties of that defined between two vectors .",
    "additionally , we set it to be always a real number .",
    "a set of basis operators are orthogonal to each other if and only if they satisfy @xmath19 by using this relation and eq .",
    "[ defbasisop ] , we find that the elements of @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath20 \\rangle .\\ ] ] to guarantee @xmath21 , we need choose a set of basis operators and an appropriate definition of the inner product , so that @xmath22\\rangle =   \\langle \\hat o_j,[\\hat h,\\hat o_i ] \\rangle .\\ ] ] this is equivalent to say that the superoperator @xmath23 $ ] is self - adjoint . as will be shown next , such a set of basis operators can always be found in a spin-1/2 system .",
    "now since @xmath15 is a real symmetric matrix and its eigenvectors are just the rows of the orthogonal matrix @xmath24 , the basis operator @xmath25 can be decomposed into the linear combination of the excitation operators : @xmath26 its expectation value at arbitrary time can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the expectation value of the basis operator with respect to the initial state .",
    "an orthonormal basis satisfying eq .",
    "[ symmrelation ] is found in the spin-1/2 systems , where the spins are located at each site on a discrete lattice .",
    "the dimension of the operator space at each site is four .",
    "a natural choice of the onsite basis operators should include the three generators of the @xmath29 algebra and the identity operator . additionally , we must guarantee the matrix @xmath15 to be a real one .",
    "so we employ the next three operators : @xmath30 instead of the traditional @xmath29 generators .",
    "the commutation relations between them are @xmath31=2\\hat o^z$ ] , @xmath32=2\\hat o^x$ ] and @xmath33=-2\\hat o^y$ ] .",
    "an arbitrary basis operator is expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the lattice site and @xmath36 takes a value in the set @xmath37 .",
    "the inner product of two basis operators is defined as the trace of their product , i.e. , @xmath38}{2^l},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the total number of sites in the model .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that such a definition satisfies both the positive definiteness of the inner product and the eq .",
    "[ symmrelation ] as the hamiltonian is self - adjoint .",
    "in this paper we focus on the one - dimensional @xmath2 model , because it can be strictly diagonalized in the noninteracting case so that we could compare the result of our method with the exact result .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 1d @xmath2 model is @xmath40 where the interacting strength @xmath41 controls the magnetic order of the system at the ground state .",
    "we are interested in the spin transport in this model .",
    "we study the evolution of the z - component of a spin located at site @xmath42 denoted by @xmath43 . for simplicity",
    ", the initial state is set to be at the high temperature limit with one spin aligned along the positive z - axis .",
    "this spin is located at site @xmath44 , and the @xmath45 is the distance between the spin that we measure and the spin source . at the high temperature limit , the z - components of the spins are all zero except that @xmath46 , and all the high order spin correlation functions vanish .",
    "of course , such an initial state is much simpler than the ground state of the system .",
    "but this does not mean that there is any difference when applying our method to the zero - temperature system .",
    "since in our method we build a pure operator identity , the additional effort that one needs at zero temperature is to evaluate the expectation values of the basis operators with respect to the ground state by employing , e.g. , the dmrg algorithm or the bethe ansatz .    by using the basis operators we re - express the hamiltonian as @xmath47 the observable operator @xmath48 is called at the zeroth level .",

    "we then calculate the commutators between the hamiltonian and each of them , which will generate the basis operators at the second level , and so on .",

    "the transient behavior of the z - component of the target spin is well predicted by decomposing it into the excitation operators .",
    "however , a strong deviation from the exact result is observed in the long - period behavior at a finite @xmath54 .",
    "increasing the @xmath54 will improve the performance at the long period , but will also increase the difficulty in diagonalizing the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "for example , as @xmath60 the dimension of the @xmath15 will be @xmath61 ! the longer the time is , the larger the dimension of the @xmath15 should be to obtain the correct result .",
    "the error of the calculation at a finite @xmath54 can be estimated by comparing the result with that after increasing @xmath54 by one . as shown in fig .  1",
    ", this gives the error bound .",
    "with the generation of the basis operators , the dimension of the operator space and the size of the matrix @xmath15 will increase rapidly , and will be soon too large to the ability of the most powerful tools of diagonalization .",
    "we conquer this problem by dividing the evolution into @xmath62 periods , each of which has a very short time interval . the observable operator in the heisenberg picture is then expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the time interval of a period . at each period",
    "the excitation operator method is employed to calculate the evolution of the involved basis operators @xmath65 . since the short - time evolution can be obtained to a high precision by the excitation operator method , the @xmath66 at whatever time",
    "can be obtained explicitly as @xmath67 . by dividing the time @xmath68 into @xmath62 intervals ,",
    "we both improve the performance of our method at the long time region and avoid diagonalizing a large matrix by keeping the @xmath54 at each period a small number .    however , the exponential growth of the number of involved basis operators is still kept .",
    "since the max level that we reach in the whole evolution process is proportional to @xmath62 , the @xmath62 can not be very large . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath62 can be greatly enhanced by neglecting the basis operators with a small weight .",
    "in fact , we find that as decomposing the @xmath69 , the weights of different basis operators may vary by several magnitudes .",
    "most of the involved basis operators has a very small weight .",
    "so we set a small number @xmath70 denoting the tolerance . at each period , the generated basis operators with a weight smaller than @xmath70 are neglected . by doing so , we could control the growth of the operator space at a low speed . and",
    "it is not difficult to estimate the error caused by a finite @xmath70 by letting @xmath71 .",

    "the numerical results are found to coincide well with the exact result at the time as large as @xmath72 , when the excitation operator method without the time division fails .",
    "the exact result is obtained by strictly diagonalizing the hamiltonian , which can be re - expressed in terms of spinless fermions @xmath73 through the jordon - wigner transformation : @xmath74 the evolution of the density @xmath75 can be easily worked out , so does the @xmath76 . in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the result is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the bessel function of the first kind .    since for different @xmath54s the numerical results always converge to the exact one as the tolerance @xmath70 and the period @xmath81 both go to zero , how to choose @xmath54 at each period is totally decided by the efficiency of the programme .",
    "we find that keeping a smallest number of basis operators at each period , i.e. , choosing @xmath82 , will always save the computation time .",
    "the reason is that the accuracy of the result is mostly decided by the total number of basis operators involved in the calculation process . and",
    "the time cost in diagonalizing a matrix grows faster than the dimension of the matrix .",
    "so diagonalizing a lot of small matrices will be more efficient than diagonalizing a few of big ones .",
    "one should notice that taking a large tolerance at the same time as taking a too small @xmath81 will cause a ridiculous result due to the landau - zener effect . because the operator keeps almost the same when the evolution time @xmath81 is very small , and a correspondingly large @xmath70 will filter out all the other basis operators except itself and then the total operator space never grows .",
    "so as keeping the tolerance invariant , one should begin with a correspondingly large @xmath81 .",
