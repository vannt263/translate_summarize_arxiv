    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite is a major communication application of quantum information theory aiming at the development of protocols for establishing secure channels protected by the laws of quantum physics .",
    "such channels can then be used to share a secure key for classical symmetrical cryptographic systems . recently , continuous - variable ( cv ) @xcite protocols of qkd ( see @xcite for review ) were developed and implemented on the basis of squeezed @xcite or coherent @xcite states .",
    "the security of cv qkd protocols in the case of gaussian modulation was then shown against collective attacks in the presence of channel noise @xcite , which also implies the security against the most general coherent attacks @xcite .",
    "cv qkd protocols , however , suffer from various imperfections . the most threatening are the untrusted ( i.e. , being under full control of a potential eavesdropper ) quantum channels , which are inclined to losses due to the attenuation and can add excess noise in the link .",
    "such noise can also be detection noise indistinguishable from the effect of the channel . in security analysis",
    "it is then supposed that all the channel imperfections are due to the presence on an eavesdropper .",
    "it was an important step in the development of cv qkd when with the use of reverse reconciliation it was shown possible to establish asymptotically secure key transmission upon any pure channel loss @xcite , while noise remains limiting to the security of the protocols .    however , the insecure quantum channel is not necessarily the single source of information leakage from a qkd protocol .",
    "a potential eavesdropper can use imperfections of the trusted ( i.e. , fully controlled by the trusted parties ) devices such as sources and detectors to gain at least partial information on the signal being sent or to control the measurement being performed at the receiver station .",
    "the noise , which is present on the trusted sides , can be fully controlled and calibrated by the trusted parties .",
    "such noise , however , can still be harmful .",
    "it was shown in particular that the preparation noise can already break the security in the reverse reconciliation protocol @xcite , but can be suppressed @xcite or tolerated in the direct reconciliation scheme @xcite .",
    "also , the trusted detection noise limits the key rate , but can be partially helpful to make the protocol more robust against noise in the quantum channel @xcite .    in the less optimistic scenario the noise or loss on the trusted sides can however be under partial control of an eavesdropper , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) .",
    "this is the case of the side channels , which we define as auxiliary channels that have either input or output controlled by a trusted party but output or input , respectively , controlled by an eavesdropper . from this point of view , the side channels differ from the main channel between the sender and receiver . supposedly , any additional information can be used by an attacker to increase the knowledge about the transmitted key .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to investigate the influence the side channels can have on security . in the following study",
    "we summarize all possible sources of side information and define them together as the side channels on either the sender or the receiver side of the protocol .",
    "one possible way to overcome the negative influence of the side channels is implementing the so - called measurement - device - independent ( mdi ) qkd protocols @xcite , which were recently suggested on the basis of cvs @xcite , where the trusted detection stations become shielded from a potential eavesdropper .",
    "however , the applicability of the device - independent cv qkd protocols is still very limited , particularly in terms of distance .    in the present paper",
    "we study the effect of the side channels in cv qkd protocols with coherent and squeezed states of light .",
    "we define the side channels as the imperfections ( signal loss and noise ) on the trusted sides , which are under partial control of an eavesdropper .",
    "in particular , we consider ( a ) the leakage from the trusted sender station and ( b ) measurement manipulation by the noise addition in the trusted receiver station .",
    "we show the degradation of the key rate and increase of vulnerability to the channel noise in the presence of a side - channel leakage .",
    "we also show a security break from the noisy side channel on the detection stage .",
    "we suggest methods to compensate for the negative influence of the described side channels . for ( a )",
    "we consider the possibility to classically apply an additional correlated signal on the side - channel input , which is under control of a trusted sender party .",
    "we show the positive effect of such additional modulation and the possibility to optimize the modulation variance for the given parameters of the protocol .",
    "moreover , we show that by applying correlated information encoding and squeezing the input of the side channel , in the case of the squeezed - state protocol , the trusted party is able to completely decouple the side channel from the signal . by decoupling here",
    "we mean decorrelation ( reducing or turning the correlation to zero ) and stopping the leakage of information through the side channel , which completely removes the negative impact of the side channel .",
    "for ( b ) we show the possibility to cancel the infused detection noise by monitoring the output of such a noise - infusing side channel .",
    "these are the alternative ways of active compensation of the side channels in the gaussian cv qkd protocols with the trusted sender and receiver stations , which keep the advantage of usability of such protocols , including the longer channel distances , compared to the device - independent protocols @xcite , and do not involve entanglement or non - gaussian operations and measurements .",
    "if for any reason the input of the sender - side leakage or the output of the receiver - side noise infusion are not available for the manipulations or monitoring , respectively , then the negative impact of the side channels shown in the current paper has to be either taken into account in the security analysis or compensated for by the possible use of the mdi schemes .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ security ] we define the side channels and recapitulate the methods of cv qkd security analysis being used . in sec .",
    "[ prob ] we demonstrate the negative impact of the side channels on the cv qkd security . in sec .",
    "[ solve ] we introduce the methods aimed at compensating for the negative effect of the side channels .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we study the effect of the side channels on the standard and optimized cv qkd protocols @xcite on the basis of the gaussian modulation of squeezed and coherent states , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) .",
    "the trusted sending side ( alice ) prepares the signal state ( squeezed or coherent ) with variance @xmath0 ( so that @xmath1 or @xmath2 , respectively ) using the source @xmath3 .",
    "alice then applies random gaussian quadrature displacement of variance @xmath4 ( also referred to as the modulation variance ) , so that the overall variance of the modulated states becomes @xmath5 , using the modulator @xmath6 .",
    "the prepared state travels through the untrusted channel parametrized by transmittance ( loss ) @xmath7 and excess noise @xmath8 both being under _ full _ control of an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "the signal is then detected by the remote receiving party ( bob ) using the homodyne detector h. further , with no loss of generality , we assume that the quadrature @xmath9 is measured by bob . thus , in the standard gaussian cv qkd protocol ( without the side channels ) alice applies displacement @xmath10 to the signal quadrature @xmath11 and sends the state with the quadrature @xmath12 to the channel so that the variances are @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 and then @xmath16 . in the standard gaussian cv qkd squeezed - state protocol",
    "@xcite the signal states are modulated up to the antisqueezing ( variance of the quadrature complementary to a squeezed one ) , so @xmath17 holds , i.e. , the variance of modulation is fixed by squeezing of the signal states .",
    "we will also consider the optimized gaussian cv qkd protocols @xcite , where modulation @xmath4 is independent of the variance of the signal states and can be freely optimized for a given signal resource and parameters of the setup .",
    "the quantum channel transforms the modulated signal such that bob measures the quadrature @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the quadrature of the vacuum input of the channel loss and @xmath20 is the quadrature of the channel excess noise with the variances @xmath21 and @xmath22 .     and gaussian quadrature displacement applied in the modulator @xmath6 .",
    "the untrusted channel is parametrized by transmittance @xmath7 and excess noise @xmath8 .",
    "the signal is coupled to the lossy side channel @xmath23 with untrusted output on the sender side and to the noisy side channel @xmath24 with untrusted input of variance @xmath25 on the receiving side .",
    "the remote trusted party performs measurement with the homodyne detector h. the _ trusted _ devices and channels are within the dashed boxes .",
    "( b ) scheme of the cv qkd with sender - side leakage modeled as coupling of the signal to a vacuum mode on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath26 .",
    "the receiver - side untrusted noise infusion is modeled as coupling to a noisy mode with variance @xmath25 on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath27 .",
    "the _ untrusted _ channels are within the dashed box . ]",
    "note that the trusted parties must know the channel parameters to assess the security of the protocols and therefore the channel must be properly estimated .",
    "while the issue of the channel estimation was recently studied in the finite - size context @xcite , in the present paper we focus on the side - channel effects and assume that the channel parameters are already known to the trusted parties .",
    "the channel estimation is still possible in the presence of the side channels because the side - channel parameters ( losses and noise ) can be estimated independently by the local measurements on the trusted sides .",
    "this also allows us to consider the protocols based on the preparation and measurement of a single quadrature ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) , while the channel estimation would require additional modulation and measurement in the complementary one .",
    "moreover , since the methods of the side - channel compensation suggested below do not change the data ensemble size ( defined by the signaling and detection rate ) , the finite - size effects @xcite would not qualitatively change the results of the paper .",
    "two types of side channels are considered in our study as shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) .",
    "the first one ( further also referred to as the _ type - a _ side channel ) is the sender - side side - channel leakage , when a vacuum mode is coupled to the signal and only the output of the coupling @xmath28 is accessible by an eavesdropper .",
    "an eavesdropper eve has no control of the side - channel input and of the strength of the coupling , thus the input state of such a side channel is initially vacuum .",
    "eve however receives the side - channel output similarly to non - invasive passive attacks in classical cryptography @xcite .",
    "the sender ( alice ) , on the contrary , has full control of the input of such a side channel before the coupling @xmath28 .",
    "the second type of side channel ( further also referred to as the _ type - b _ side channel ) is untrusted noise addition in the receiver station . in this case",
    "an untrusted noise with variance @xmath25 is supposedly prepared by eve and coupled to the signal prior to detection with the output of the coupling being inaccessible to the eavesdropper .",
    "the eavesdropper is not able to change the coupling strength . on the contrary , the receiving side ( bob ) is able to control ( e.g. , measure ) the output of the coupling @xmath29 . in both the cases we assume that the trusted parties are not able to directly remove the side channels or change the coupling strengths ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) .",
    "these are the two main types of possible semitrusted side channels , while the completely trusted noise is covered by previous research @xcite and completely untrusted noise can be attributed to the channel . moreover ,",
    "the noise infusion on the sender side ( symmetrical to the type - b side channel on the receiver side that is considered in the present paper ) is equivalent to the additional noise in the untrusted channel . at the same time",
    "the side - channel loss on the receiver side ( symmetrical to the type - a side - channel loss on the sender side that is also considered here ) is equivalent to the additional loss in the untrusted channel .",
    "thus , our analysis covers the main possible semitrusted side channels based on the two - mode interaction in the prepare - and - measure cv qkd .",
    "we do not consider any specific physical realization of the side channels applying our analysis to the general case of semitrusted side channels based on the linear - optical mode interaction .",
    "however , the side channels can be expected in any real implementation of cv qkd in either fiber @xcite or free - space channels @xcite , where coherent and squeezed states were successfully transferred .",
    "the sender - side leakage can take place in particular in the case of imperfect modulation , e.g. , when the signal is mixed with a temporal , spectral , polarization , or spatial mode , which then leaves the sender station .",
    "the receiver - side noise infusion may , e.g. , be caused by imperfect light collection from a free - space channel with a background radiation .",
    "linear optical crosstalk is well studied in the classical optical communications where it is present in the multiplexed channels and receivers @xcite , but was also reported in the quantum communications @xcite .",
    "linear coupling represented by the beam splitter transformation is generally used to model the interaction of a quantum - optical system with the environment @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our work we use the typical linear optical interaction and model the mode coupling between the signal and the side channels as the beam splitters [ see fig . [ scheme](b ) ] .",
    "the type - a side channel is modeled as coupling to a vacuum mode on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath26 . on the other side we model the type - b side channel as coupling to a thermal noise mode with variance @xmath25 on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath27 . in the case of the sender - side leakage ( type - a ) side channel the quadrature that enters the quantum channel",
    "is then changed to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the quadrature value of the vacuum state on the input of the beam splitter , @xmath32 . in the case of the noise - infusing ( type - b )",
    "side channel the output of the quantum channel is changed as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the input noise of the type - b side channel with @xmath35 .    in the analysis of the negative impact of the side channels on cv qkd and the methods to compensate for such impact we mainly study the security against collective attacks , which in the asymptotic limit were shown to be no less effective than the most general coherent attacks @xcite . in this case eve",
    "performs the optimal collective measurement on the accessible modes after the process of bases reconciliation is completed , implying that eve attaches a separate uncorrelated probe to each transmitted state and keeps probes in a quantum memory until she can gather additional information . to obtain simple insight into the conditions for insecurity of the protocols we also study the security against individual attacks , in which case eve",
    "is limited by the individual measurement on the accessible modes .",
    "this weaker security analysis allows us to analytically derive the regions of insecurity of the protocols in the presence of side channels since insecurity against individual attacks implies insecurity against the more effective collective attacks .    following the generalization of the cziszr - krner theorem @xcite on the quantum measurements performed by devetak and winter @xcite ,",
    "the protocol is secure if the mutual information between the trusted parties exceeds the information available to eve on the data on the trusted receiver side ( in the case of reverse reconciliation , which is stable against channel loss @xcite ) .",
    "the security is then described by the positivity of the lower bound on the key rate which in the case of collective attacks reads : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the postprocessing efficiency and @xmath38 is holevo bound that determines eve s achievable information limit in the case of collective attacks @xcite .",
    "the efficiency @xmath39 depends on the effectiveness of the data postprocessing algorithms that are being used in the secure key distillation given the particularly low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we set @xmath39 as an independent parameter and do not consider any particular postprocessing algorithm . in the following analysis we therefore fix the reconciliation efficiency as @xmath40 ,",
    "which is realistic taking into account the recent progress in the error - correcting algorithms for the gaussian - distributed data @xcite .",
    "the holevo bound can be expressed as @xmath41 through the von neumann entropy @xmath42 of the generally multimode state ( including the side channels ) , which is available to eve for the collective measurement described by the respective covariance matrix @xmath43 , and the von neumann entropy @xmath44 of the state available to eve conditioned on the measurement results of the remote trusted party bob @xcite and described by the covariance matrix @xmath45 .",
    "covariance matrices are the matrices of the second moments of quadratures of the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the quadrature vector of an @xmath48-th mode . along with the first moments the covariance matrices explicitly describe the gaussian states and are sufficient for the security analysis of the gaussian protocols @xcite due to the extremality of the gaussian states @xcite .",
    "we analyze the security against the collective attacks using the most general purification method @xcite , where the equivalent entanglement - based representation of the protocols is used and all the state imperfections corresponding to the side channels and the main channel are attributed to eve .    in the case of individual attacks the upper bound on the information available to an eavesdropper is given by the shannon mutual information @xmath49 instead of the holevo bound and the lower bound on the key rate ( in the optimistic case of perfect postprocessing efficiency ) reads @xmath50 .",
    "details of calculations for security analysis in the cases of both individual and collective attacks are given in the appendix , while here we present the main expressions and results .",
    "in the next section we study the negative impact of the side channels on cv qkd .",
    "let us first consider the type - a side channel .",
    "we start by analyzing the region of insecurity of the protocol with respect to the individual attacks and without the untrusted channel noise .",
    "the mutual information in this case reads ( see the appendix for details ) @xmath51 while the information available to eve reads @xmath52[v-\\eta_a \\eta ( v-1)]}{v}\\label{typeamie}\\ ] ] and is independent of the signal states ( squeezed or coherent ) .",
    "as can be seen the side channel decreases the mutual information between the trusted parties and increases eve s information , therefore limiting the key rate already for individual attacks with pure channel losses .    in the optimal ( given perfect postprocessing @xmath53 ) limit of infinite squeezing and modulation @xmath54 upon pure channel loss ( @xmath55 ) the key rate for the standard gaussian cv qkd protocol",
    "can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 for the squeezed - state protocol and @xmath58 for the coherent - state one .",
    "the channel transmittance @xmath7 is therefore effectively decreased by the side - channel coupling @xmath26 .",
    "thus the presence of the type - a side channel does not break the security , i.e. , the key rate remains positive for any nonzero value of @xmath26 , as one would expect , because the channel remains purely lossy .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     note that the uncorrelated modulation can be also combined with squeezing on the input of the side channel .",
    "this combination in the case of the squeezed - state protocol greatly improves the method of uncorrelated modulation , making it ( provided the modulation is optimized ) almost as effective as the method of optimized correlated modulation combined with squeezing ( on the plots in fig .",
    "[ distance ] the corresponding line in the plotted region of parameters overlaps with the black solid line corresponding to the absence of the side channel and the difference corresponding to the limited performance of the method can only be seen for very low values of the key rate , which are irrelevant due to unavoidable finite - size effects @xcite ) .      in the case when eve couples an additional noise to the signal prior to the detection at bob s side , the monitoring of the coupling output , which is not accessible to eve , can be used .",
    "then , by applying the proper manipulation on the data from the main detector and from the monitoring detector the negative influence of the type - b side channel can also be fully compensated for .",
    "we suggest the method of weighted subtraction of data from the main and the monitoring detector and show that the resulting measurement is free from the influence of the type - b side channel . indeed , if the main homodyne detector @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "[ solution ] ) after the noise - infusing side channel measures the quadrature @xmath33 , where @xmath60 is the output of the main quantum channel and @xmath34 is the noise quadrature of the type - b side channel input with @xmath35 , and the monitoring detector @xmath61 measures the quadrature @xmath62 , then the weighted difference @xmath63 ( and similarly for the @xmath64 quadrature ) is free from the influence of the side channel for @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ". therefore , the additional optimized monitoring on the output of the noise - infusing side channel resulting in the detection of @xmath67 can _ completely _ remove the negative impact of such a side channel . note that any pair of coefficients satisfying @xmath68 fully restores the performance of the protocol leading to @xmath69 , and the linear scaling of the latter observable does not affect the lower bound on the secure key rate .",
    "the complete removal of the noise - infusing side channel is possible also with the imperfect detectors .",
    "if both the main homodyne detector @xmath59 and the monitoring detector @xmath61 have efficiency @xmath70 and excess noise , which can be modeled by coupling of the signal to the noise mode with the variance @xmath71 on the coupler @xmath70 ( this is the standard model of the imperfect homodyne detector used in the security analysis of cv qkd @xcite ) , then the settings @xmath72 and @xmath73 given above also remove @xmath34 from the weighted difference @xmath74 and the variance then reads @xmath75 .",
    "that is , the optimal monitoring of the side - channel output then becomes equivalent to the side - channel - free detection of the signal on the same imperfect homodyne detector ( the details of the calculations are given in the appendix ) , which contains only the trusted noise and thus does not lead to the security break in the reverse - reconciliation scheme @xcite .    to calculate the security against the collective attacks we consider the scheme using the equivalent interferometric setup , when the residual side channel is coupled to the signal and then detected ( see the appendix for details )",
    "this leads to the appropriate transformations of the variances and correlations .",
    "the results of calculations are given in fig .",
    "[ krbs ] without the side - channel monitoring and with optimal monitoring of the residual side channel .",
    "it is evident that the optimal side - channel monitoring restores the performance of the protocol providing exactly the same key rate as in the absence of the side channel .",
    "the noise - infusing side channel can therefore be _ completely _ compensated for .",
    "simultaneously , the gaussian entanglement between the trusted parties is fully restored even if it was previously broken by the effect of noise infused in the side channel .",
    "experimental aspects of noise cancellation by the measurement have been studied in @xcite , which demonstrates the feasibility of such a method for cv qkd .",
    "note that the result reported here is obtained under different conditions than the previous analysis of the multimode channels @xcite , where the auxiliary channels received by bob contain information encoded by alice , i.e. , are parallel to the main quantum channel .     and @xmath76 of the couplers and by the phase shift @xmath77 ) to the noisy side channel with untrusted input of variance @xmath25 on the receiving side and the monitoring of the side - channel output followed by the data manipulation . ]",
    "we also consider the side - channel noise infusion based on the generalized interferometric interaction modeled by two couplers with different transmittance values @xmath78 and @xmath76 and a phase shift @xmath77 in one of the arms between the couplers as shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme - b - adv ] . in this case",
    "the monitoring of the side - channel output suggested above can fully restore the performance of the protocol only when the phase shift is absent ( i.e. , @xmath79 , see the appendix for the details ) and the optimal coefficients of the data manipulation read @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the setting can be obtained by maximizing the mutual information between the trusted parties and therefore does not require the estimation of @xmath78 and @xmath76 independently .",
    "however , when the nonzero phase shift is present and the output of the interferometric coupling contains combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath64 quadratures of the signal and the noise input , simple side - channel monitoring by the homodyne detection in the @xmath9 quadrature and the linear data manipulation are not sufficient to completely restore the performance of the protocol .",
    "it can can be used to partly compensate for the negative influence of the type - b side channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kr - b - adv ] , where the key rate is plotted for the coherent- and squeezed - state protocols with respect to the weighting @xmath73 ( assuming @xmath80 ) , which can maximize the mutual information and , respectively , the key rate .",
    "( upper lines ) and the coherent - state protocol ( lower lines ) in the absence of the type - b side channel ( black horizontal dotted lines ) , with no phase shift @xmath79 ( dashed blue lines ) , with @xmath82 ( green dot - dashed lines ) , and @xmath83 ( red solid lines ) .",
    "the parameters of the interaction in the presence of the side channel are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the modulation variance @xmath86 , the channel transmittance is @xmath87 , and the protocols implementation is otherwise perfect . ]    the optimal data manipulation setting in the general case becomes the lengthy function on the parameters of the protocol , including the values of the coupling and the phase shift as well as the signal and modulation variances and the parameters of the channel . in order to improve the decoupling of the side channel",
    "an optimal additional phase shift can be applied prior to the control detection ( so that the mutual information is maximized ) or a more general strategy based on the heterodyne detection and subsequent data manipulation could be used and optimized similarly to the elimination of the cross - talk in the channel @xcite .",
    "we have studied the effect of the side - channel leakage and noise infusion on the trusted sides of the continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocols .",
    "the negative effect of the side - channel leakage on the trusted sender side leads to the degradation of the key rate and to the increased sensitivity of the protocol to the channel noise . at the same time",
    ", the side - channel noise infusion on the trusted receiver side can completely break the security of the protocols even upon pure channel loss .",
    "we suggested and examined the method of additional modulation applied to the side - channel input being under the control of a trusted sending party .",
    "we show that if the additional modulation is properly correlated with the main modulation on the signal and squeezing applied on the side - channel input in the case of the squeezed - state protocol , the negative impact of the lossy side channel can be completely removed .",
    "alternatively , we show the possibility to compensate for the negative impact of the noisy side channel on the receiver side by introducing the monitoring of the output of the side channel . since both methods work independently by completely removing the side channels , they can be combined in a single protocol . moreover , since the optimal settings for the methods are independent of the channel parameters , the methods can be applied by the trusted parties using only the parameters of their local trusted stations and do not themselves rely on the channel estimation .",
    "our result therefore describes the effective and feasible methods of compensating for the quantum side channels in a continuous - variable quantum key distribution between the trusted parties , which do not require entanglement or non - gaussian operations .",

    "derive the covariance matrices describing the states shared between the trusted parties alice and bob and available to an eavesdropper eve , which are then used in the security analysis below .      as mentioned , we estimate the security of the protocols in the presence of the side channels and upon additional manipulations aimed to remove the side channels , as the value and positivity of the lower bound on the key rate , which in the case of collective attacks ( when eve is able to collectively measure her probe states after interaction with the signal ) and reverse reconciliation @xcite reads @xmath95 , where @xmath37 is the postprocessing efficiency that takes into account the amount of data that trusted parties lose due to imperfections of the error correction algorithms , @xmath96 is the mutual information between the trusted parties , and @xmath38 is the holevo bound , giving the upper bound on the information that is available to eve . in the case of individual attacks ,",

    "such transformations lead to changes of variances and covariances that form the resulting covariance matrices .",
    "the lower bound on the key rate secure against collective attacks is then calculated numerically using [ eq : von_neumann ] and [ eq : bosonicef ] . in the case when modulation @xmath4 is independent of the signal squeezing @xmath0 the more general entanglement - based scheme @xcite is used instead of the standard epr - based purification described above .",

    "further , we describe the theoretical purification schemes used to calculate the holevo bound in the particular cases .",

    "the state of the modes abcd contains all the purified trusted noise and the holevo bound for the standard gaussian protocols is then calculated following the purification method as @xmath163 .",

    "indeed , the quadrature measured on the signal mode @xmath175 after all the interactions is given by @xmath221+x_{scb}[\\sqrt{\\eta_b(1-t)}-\\sqrt{t(1-\\eta_b)}]$ ] , where @xmath60 is the main signal mode before the side - channel interaction and @xmath34 is the side - channel input prior to interaction .",
    "it is easy to see that upon @xmath220 the resulting quadrature @xmath222 of mode @xmath175 contains no side - channel noise due to the destructive interference and the negative effect of the side channel is removed completely .",
    "note that if the reflection of the mode @xmath24 on the beam splitter @xmath223 would be absent and the mode @xmath175 would be directly coupled to the mode @xmath24 on the beam splitter with transmittance @xmath135 , the equivalent measurement that removes the type - b side channel would be on the mode @xmath24 upon @xmath224 .",
    "the described scheme allows calculations using the purification method simply as @xmath225 since the side - channel output monitoring emulated by the interferometric setup does not change the purity of the states .",
    "the performance of the protocol thus becomes equivalent to the one of the protocol without the type - b side channel , which is confirmed in the case of collective attacks in a noisy channel . in the case of the generalized preparation",
    "( when modulation is independent of the signal state variance ) we apply a similar scheme but replace the epv : v source with the generalized entangled state preparation as described in @xcite .    in the case of the interferometric - type interaction between the signal and the type - b side channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kr - b - adv ] , the mode transformations during the interactions become more complex and read    @xmath226+x_{scb}\\big[\\sqrt{\\eta_{b2}(1-\\eta_{b1})}+ { } } \\nonumber \\\\ & { } + \\cos{\\phi}\\sqrt{\\eta_{b1}(1-\\eta_{b2})}\\big]-p_b\\sin{\\phi}\\sqrt{(1-\\eta_{b1})(1-\\eta_{b2})}+p_{scb}\\sin{\\phi}\\sqrt{\\eta_{b1}(1-\\eta_{b2})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath227 + x_{scb}\\big[\\cos{\\phi}\\sqrt{\\eta_{b1}\\eta_{b2}}- { } } \\nonumber \\\\ & { } -\\sqrt{(1-\\eta_{b1})(1-\\eta_{b2})}\\big]- p_b\\sin{\\phi}\\sqrt{\\eta_{b2}(1-\\eta_{b1})}+ p_{scb}\\sin{\\phi}\\sqrt{\\eta_{b1}\\eta_{b2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now involving the contributions from the @xmath64 quadratures @xmath228 and @xmath229 of the signal and side - channel noise modes respectively , which is caused by the phase shift in the interaction .",
    "this prevents the complete decoupling of the type - b side channel by simple manipulation on the homodyne measurement results in the form @xmath230 , as illustrated in fig [ kr - b - adv ] ( plotted based on the numerical calculations using the equivalent transmittance @xmath135 in the purification - based scheme ) .",
    "the complete decoupling in such a case is possible only when @xmath79 and the cross - quadrature terms are absent ."
