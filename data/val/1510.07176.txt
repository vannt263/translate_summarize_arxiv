    "cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) is a cloud computing - based radio access network architecture in which , unlike traditional cellular systems , the protocol stack of a cluster of base stations ( bss ) is virtualized by means of a control unit ( cu ) , to which the bss are connected via a fronthaul network .",
    "this architecture enables centralized signal processing at the cu , hence allowing the implementation of effective interference management strategies , which may dramatically improve the physical - layer capacity of the system @xcite -@xcite .",
    "however , the transmission and queueing delays on the fronthaul network generally limit the gains that can be achieved when considering the performance at higher layers , particularly at layer 2 @xcite -@xcite .",
    "fronthaul latency affects most notably the operations of automatic retransmission request ( arq ) protocols in the uplink , which rely on the transmission of acknowledgement ( ack ) or negative - acknowledgement ( nak ) messages to the mobile terminals ( mts ) , indicating respectively correct or incorrect packet decoding .",
    "in fact , due to fronthaul transmission and processing , these messages incur a delay that may significantly reduce throughput and efficiency of retransmission mechanisms .",
    "for example , in long - term evolution ( lte ) systems , a latency larger than 3 - 8 ms disrupts the normal working of the hybrid arq ( harq ) protocol @xcite .    in  @xcite , in order to mitigate the effect of fronthaul latency on the performance of harq protocols , it is proposed that the bss make local decisions regarding the expected outcome of decoding at the cu without waiting for the actual feedback from the cu .",
    "the local decisions are made based on the knowledge at the bss of the modulation and coding scheme used for uplink transmission and on an estimate of the channel state information .",
    "note that this requires the bss to implement enough baseband functionalities to be able to perform resource demapping , e.g. , synchronization and fft , as well as channel estimation , hence deviating from the conventional c - ran paradigm @xcite@xcite .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that , especially for small coding blocks , the local decisions taken at the bss may be incorrect , causing inefficiencies in the use of the spectral resources and delays @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite is oblivious to the magnitude of the fronthaul latency , as it is implicitly based on the assumption of instantaneous ack / nak feedback from the bss to the mts . in this letter , instead , we are interested in evaluating the performance of arq protocols as a function of the fronthaul latency .",
    "fronthaul latency translates into feedback delays , whose impact on the performance of arq , unlike in the analysis in @xcite , depends on the specific implemented arq protocol .",
    "this is because different arq protocols react in distinct ways to feedback delays .",
    "in particular , we consider the throughput and efficiency of standard arq protocols , namely stop and wait ( sw ) , go - back - n ( gbn ) and selective repeat ( sr ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , as a function of the fronthaul delay .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the key role that interference mitigation plays in the evaluation of the performance benefits of c - ran , unlike prior work , we explicitly consider the impact of interference .",
    "specifically , the dynamics of the interference process , along with that of the channel gains , are modelled by means of markov processes .",
    "the analysis encompasses the standard c - ran implementation with centralized baseband processing , as well as conventional cellular systems and an hybrid approach that is akin to the solution studied in @xcite . in the hybrid approach ,",
    "a bs first attempts local decoding , and processing at the cu is invoked only if this decoding attempt is unsuccessful .",
    "it is noted that , as for the approach in @xcite , this hybrid solution requires the bss to be endowed with baseband processing functionalities .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ system ] describes the system model and the arq protocols considered in this paper .",
    "section  [ model ] presents the analysis based on markov modelling that is used to assess throughput and efficiency . in section  [ evaluation ] ,",
    "numerical results are shown to illustrate the performance of the system .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the uplink of the cellular system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] is considered , which is composed of a cluster of bss connected to a cu through fronthaul links .",
    "slotted time is assumed , where the transmission of one packet fits the duration of one time slot .",
    "the mts store packets to be transmitted in a finite first - in first - out buffer of size @xmath0 packets .",
    "packet arrival in the buffer is modeled as an independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "process , where the probability that a new packet arrives in one slot is equal to @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the mts implement arq to improve packet reliability , where failed packets are retransmitted until successfully decoded .",
    "we specifically study the standard arq protocols sw , gbn and sr .",
    "we consider three different system implementations , namely : ( _ i _ ) _ conventional cellular system _ : an assigned bs performs decoding of the uplink signal of any given mt ; ( _ ii _ ) _ c - ran _ : the cu performs decoding based on the signals received by all bss on the fronthaul links ; ( _ iii _ ) _ hybrid c - ran _ : an assigned bs first attempts decoding and , if it fails , the received signal is forwarded to the cu , which attempts decoding based on all the bss signals .",
    "as mentioned , the latter solution requires the implementation of an alternative functional split between bs and cu , as compared to conventional c - rans , in which the bs implements baseband functionalities @xcite .",
    "we assume that the propagation time between mt and bs is negligible , so that packets transmitted in slot @xmath3 are acknowledged by means of ack / nak messages at the end of the same slot , if decoding takes place at the bs as in systems ( _ i _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) . instead , to capture the delay associated with two - way transmission over the fronthaul network",
    ", we assume that ack / nak messages relative to decoding at the cu are received at the mts after @xmath4 time slots in systems ( _ ii _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) .    a detailed description and discussion of the signal processing techniques used in a c - ran architecture of bss and cu can be found in , e.g. ,  @xcite . here , focusing on the performance at layer 2 , we abstract the physical layer by adopting a simple threshold model on the signal to noise ratio .",
    "specifically , a packet transmitted by an mt in a slot @xmath5 is successfully decoded at an assigned bs in architectures ( _ i _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) if the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the bs satisfies the condition @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the decoding threshold ; @xmath8 is the variance of the noise ; @xmath9 is the channel gain between the given mt and the assigned bs in slot @xmath5 ; @xmath10 is the uplink transmitted power ; and the term @xmath11 captures the overall interference incurred by the packet sent by the mt in slot @xmath5 . instead , to account for decoding at the cu in architectures ( _ ii _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) , we assume that the cu can effectively remove the interference based on the signals received from multiple bss . as a result",
    ", a packet is decoded at the cu if the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the cu satisfies @xmath12 where the additional noise term @xmath13 captures the effect of quantization noise , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the latter is generally an exponentially decreasing function of the fronthaul capacity and is proportional to the received power @xcite . here",
    ", in order to focus on the effect of the fronthaul latency , we assume this term to be small enough to be negligible as compared to the channel noise .",
    "the analysis could be easily extended to a scenario in which this assumption is violated .",
    "the temporal evolution of the interference process @xmath11 is modeled as an on - off process @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a binary markov chain .",
    "this simple model captures the correlation in the interference process that results from the packet arrival process at the interfering nodes , as well as from the temporal correlation of the interferers channel gains .",
    "we note that the model can be extended to include multiple levels of interference and that the transition probabilities , to be discussed below , are generally a function the transmission patterns of the interfering nodes .    to measure the performance of the network , we use the following metrics : ( _ a _ ) _ throughput _ , i.e. , the average number of packets successfully decoded per slot ; ( _ b _ ) _ efficiency _ , i.e. , the average number of packets successfully decoded per slot divided by the fraction of slots in which the mt transmits .",
    "we observe that the efficiency directly reflects the energy requirements at the mt since a low efficiency entails the need for more packet transmissions .",
    "we now briefly recall the three arq protocols under study . for a more detailed discussion",
    ", please see @xcite .      with sw ,",
    "if the buffer is non - empty , the oldest packet is transmitted by the mt in the uplink and the mt waits idle to receive an ack / nak message .",
    "therefore , in the conventional cellular architecture ( _ i _ ) and in the hybrid c - ran system ( _ iii _ ) , if the bs successfully decodes the packet , an ack is received in the same slot , and the mt can transmit the next packet in the queue in the following slot . instead , in architecture ( _ i _ ) ,",
    "if the bs fails , the packet is retransmitted in the next slot , while , in system ( _ iii _ ) , the mt waits @xmath16 slots and then transmits a new packet or retransmit the same packet upon reception of the ack / nack relative to decoding at the cu . finally , in the c - ran system ( _ ii _ ) , the mt always waits @xmath16 slots for feedback from the cu , and transmits the same or the next packet depending on whether a nak or ack message is received .      with gbn",
    ", the mt keeps a list , or window , of at most @xmath17 outstanding packets that have been transmitted but whose ack / nak messages have not been received or processed yet at the mt . if the window contains less than @xmath17 packets , a new packet is transmitted from the queue if there is any . when the window is full , the mt checks for the ack / nak messages that have been received for the packets in the window .",
    "if there are no ack / nak messages , the mt stays idle .",
    "if there are , packets are considered starting from the oldest in the window . for this packet , if an ack has been received , the window slides to the following packet , which is considered next ; instead , if a nak has been received for the packet , the mt retransmits this and all the following packets in the current window .",
    "note that gbn is meant to avoid the throughput loss associated with idle transmit periods caused in sw by delayed feedback , and is hence relevant , in our context , only for the c - ran and hybrid c - ran architectures .",
    "this is because , in these systems , an mt implementing sw must wait for feedback from the cu , whereas gbn allows the transmission of new packets , if the window is not full , even before reception of ack / nak messages for the last transmitted packet .      with sr",
    ", the mt operates in the same was as for gbn with the caveat that , when the window is full and ack / nak messages are considered for the packets in the window , only the failed packet are retransmitted . as for gbn , hence , sr is relevant only for the c - ran and hybrid c - ran architectures .",
    "in this section , we evaluate throughput and efficiency of the arq protocols discussed above by focusing on the performance of an individual mt .",
    "the dynamics of the system are modeled as a markov chain @xmath18 with a finite state space @xmath19 .",
    "the transmission process of the mt , along with the channel @xmath9 and the interference process @xmath20 are sub - chains that together compose the overall chain .",
    "the state of the system chain in slot @xmath5 is denoted as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 tracks the protocol state , e.g. , the state of the queue at the mt and also of the retransmission window for the gbn and sr protocols .",
    "the transition probability @xmath23 , for any two states @xmath24 , @xmath25 can be factored as @xmath26 where we have @xmath27 in the following , we briefly elaborate on the dynamics of channel , interference and protocol , as defined by the factors in eq .",
    "( [ factors ] ) .",
    "we adopt a correlated rayleigh fading model with correlation coefficient @xmath28 across two successive slots @xcite and unitary power . in order to make the model manageable within the markov chain framework at hand",
