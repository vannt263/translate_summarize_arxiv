    "group - iii nitride semiconductors such as aln , gan and inn have drawn considerable attention in recent years because they generate efficient luminescence and their band gaps include the entire visible spectrum and a part of the ultraviolet ( uv ) . as a result of intense research on these compounds , visible light - emitting diodes and",
    "uv laser diodes are available nowadays , opening the way to further developments in optoelectronics , specially in optical storage technology .",
    "these materials are also advantageous in high - power and high - temperature electronics .",
    "we focus on gan , since it is the most outstanding nitride of this group , widely used and researched.@xcite    the great interest in semiconductor quantum dots ( qd s ) is based on the possibility of tailoring their electrooptical properties through the control of size and doping .",
    "nanocrystalline@xcite and self - assembled@xcite qd s of gan have been synthesized and show the confinement - induced blue shift .",
    "recently , eu - doped gan nanocrystals ( nc s ) yielding a bright and narrow eu@xmath1 ion fluorescence line have been shown to be useful as an efficient marker of important biological processes.@xcite however , to our knowledge , no experimental study of donor- or acceptor - doped gan qd s has yet been reported .",
    "theoretically , spherical nc s containing a substitutional impurity have been investigated previously.@xcite both donors and acceptors have been studied within a variational approach ( va)@xcite and the effective - mass approximation ( ema).@xcite acceptors have also been treated in the atomistic framework : effective bond - orbital@xcite and tight - binding ( tb)@xcite models .",
    "the electronic structure of a doped qd is highly sensitive to the position of the impurity atom .",
    "but most of the theoretical studies reported so far have focused on on - center impurities .",
    "the impurity position dependence has been investigated only for donors in the continuous models , va and ema , which are known to be inadequate for the electronic structure of small - size qd s and highly localized acceptor states even in the bulk . in the present work we report a tb model calculation of the electronic structure for both on- and off - center donor and acceptor impurities in gan nc s of diameter up to 13.5  nm .",
    "a preliminary study reported previously@xcite was limited to only on - center acceptor impurities in small - size nc s up to 4.5  nm in diameter .",
    "also , it was based on the simple semi - empirical @xmath2 model of vogl _",
    "et al_.@xcite in contrast , the calculations presented here are based on the extended @xmath0 model of jancu _",
    "et al_.,@xcite which provides a more satisfactory description of the band structure in the bulk .",
    "for the acceptor impurity we focus on mg as an example .",
    "it substitutes for a ga cation in the zinc - blende lattice .",
    "the hole binding energy in the bulk is known to be @xmath3  mev.@xcite for the donor we consider o , which replaces a n anion yielding an electron binding energy of @xmath4  mev in the bulk.@xcite the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present an outline of the theoretical model ; in sections iii and iv we show the binding energy and average radius of the bound carrier as a function of the dopant location and the qd size ; in section v we conclude by summarizing the main results .",
    "the gan host material is described by a semi - empirical @xmath0 tb hamiltonian which includes the spin - orbit interaction , and was first introduced by jancu _ _ et al.__@xcite : @xmath5 where _ i _ and _ j _ denote the atomic sites , @xmath6 and @xmath7 the single - electron orbitals , and @xmath8 the hopping and on - site energies ; @xmath9 is a constant standing for the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the tight - binding parameters account for the electronic structure of bulk gan.@xcite    we need to take into consideration the dangling bonds on the surface of the quasi - spherical crystallite , since they introduce states within the band gap .",
    "the simplest way to move these states several ev s away from the band gap region consists in binding every dangling bond to a hydrogen atom;@xcite the ga - h and n - h distances are taken as one half the respective covalent bond lengths .",
    "this simple passivation procedure is more detailed in a previous work@xcite and references therein .",
    "the effective bohr radius @xmath10 of the hole bound to an acceptor in bulk gan is typically small : in the case of mg ( binding energy @xmath11 mev ) it is 4.5   .",
    "the bohr radius @xmath12 of the electron bound to a donor is much larger : @xmath13   for o ( @xmath14 mev ) .",
    "these values of the bohr radii are obtained in the hydrogenic model : @xmath15 , where the effective mass is 0.8  @xmath16 for the bound hole@xcite and 0.15  @xmath16 for the bound electron.@xcite since the donor bohr radius is over six times larger than that of the acceptor , we need to construct large enough qd s to follow the confinement effects on donors .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian matrices are huge and sparse .",
    "for example , our largest qd consists of @xmath17 atoms and gives a matrix of size over @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the new ( lower ) symmetries introduced by the off - center impurities are difficult to handle within a group - theoretical framework , as in ref .  .",
    "hence , we resort to lanczos algorithms@xcite to calculate the few dopant levels we are interested in .",
    "the numerical libraries that we use are freely avaliable at the arpack site.@xcite    the impurity is modelled by a screened coulomb potential : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance between the lattice site _ i _ and the impurity , _ r _ the nc radius , and @xmath21 the dielectric function within the crystal . here",
    "@xmath22 stands for the central cell potential which obviously can not be described in terms of the long - range coulomb potential that represents the impurity atom in its crystalline environment as an effective point charge . in the absence of any precise theoretical model , as usual",
    ", we shall treat @xmath22 as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "position - dependent dielectric functions have been proposed by resta@xcite and by franceschetti and troparevsky.@xcite the position dependence is , however , restricted to a small volume around the dopant , typically smaller than the distance between two nearest - neighbor atoms,@xcite beyond which the permitivity recovers the long - distance behavior . when restricted to qd s",
    "that means simply a value dependent on the qd size .",
    "we then take a size - dependent dielectric function given by the simplified penn model@xcite : @xmath23 the parameters entering this model are @xmath24 , the material - dependent @xmath25 , by using @xmath26  ev and @xmath27  ev ( ref .  ) , and the bulk dielectric constant@xcite @xmath28 .",
    "the acceptor and donor binding energies are respectively defined as@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy of the valence band - edge state , the so - called highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) , and @xmath31 the energy of the conduction band - edge state , the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , in the undoped nc .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the same states , but in the doped nc .",
    "we also compute the average radius of the bound carrier , @xmath34 , which is related to the effective bohr radius at large @xmath35 : @xmath36",
    "we first study the electronic structure of undoped qd s .",
    "the calculated energy levels @xmath30 and @xmath31 are plotted against the nc radius in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "they are the reference levels for calculating the impurity binding energies ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hl ] ) ) .",
    "note the dramatic increase of the band gap with decreasing qd size .",
    "this confinement - induced blue shift is in accord with the reported spectroscopic studies of gan ncs.@xcite quantitatively , we obtain a satisfactory agreement with experiment : as an example , the calculated gap for nc s of 30   diameter is roughly the same as the experimental value @xmath37  ev reported in ref .  .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the full size range , the homo and lumo degeneracies we obtain are compatible with the @xmath38 and @xmath39 representations , respectively , in accord with the symmetry analysis of ref .  .",
    "another feature illustrated in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] is a comparison of the electronic structure in two different crystallizations : ga- and n - centered nc s .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the difference between them is negligible for @xmath40   . even in smaller nc s ( see the insets ) the small fluctuations do not seem to be significant .",
    "this behavior allows us to restrict our considerations to cation - centered nc s for an acceptor impurity and anion - centered nc s for a donor impurity even in the case of off - center impurities ( see below ) without any loss of generality .",

    "the results for the smallest nc s are displayed .",

    "we next discuss the impurity states starting with the acceptor impurity .",
    "we calculate the homo in nc s with a mg atom replacing the ga at the center and deduce the corresponding hole binding energy @xmath41 as a function of the nc radius for different values of the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the results are found to fit the simple expression ( dropping the superscripts for simplicity ) @xmath42 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] for @xmath43  ev .",
    "note that this particular value of @xmath22 has been chosen for the mg impurity in gan , because the corresponding asymptotic limit @xmath44  ev approximately reproduces the experimental bulk binding energy ( 0.236 ev ) .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] , [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig8 ] correspond to the same value of @xmath22 .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath45 , _ a _ and @xmath46 , of course , depend on @xmath22 . they may also depend on the qd size range . generally speaking ,",
    "the size ranges can be distinguished in terms of two different regimes of confinement : @xmath47 ( weak confinement ) and @xmath48 ( strong confinement ) . in the strong - confinement regime",
    "the usual image of the impurity center as a hydrogen - like entity is no longer valid .",
    "the asymptotic value @xmath49(bulk ) obviously corresponds to @xmath45 in the weak - confinement regime . since the radii of",
    "all the investigated nc s are larger than the mg acceptor bohr radius , all of them belong to the weak - confinement regime in this case , and a single set of fitting parameters is sufficient as shown in fig .  2 .",

    "the ground - state of the hole in the same qd when doped with a mg atom is shown in the lower panel . both are band - edge wave functions , remarkably different from each other : the homo is spread over the whole nc with a maximum at @xmath51 , while the bound hole is essentially concentrated on the five nearest - neighbor atomic shells .",
    "this highly localized character of the acceptor hole in the ground state remains unchanged over the whole set of nc s , as illustrated by the small size dependence of the average radius shown in fig .  4 , in agreement with experiment in the bulk .",

    "two distinct sets of fitting parameters are obtained for the two confinement regimes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we show the results for @xmath59 ev : the binding energy is strongly enhanced in the smallest nc s and tends to 0.027 ev in the bulk limit , which is close to the experimental value @xmath60  ev .",

    "this occurs when the mg atom is placed within a surface layer of thickness @xmath69   of the order of the acceptor bohr radius .",
