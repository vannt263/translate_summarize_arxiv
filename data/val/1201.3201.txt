    "a banach space that has the so - called radon - nikodym property , in short rnp , satisfies the condition that all lipschitz curves taking values in this space are almost everywhere frchet differentiable .",
    "this property is equivalent to the fact that for a banach space @xmath0 all @xmath0-valued lipschitz mappings defined on the euclidean space are almost everywhere frchet differentiable if and only if @xmath0 has the rnp .",
    "recently , j. cheeger and b. kleiner have shown that banach spaces with the rnp form the sharp class of targets for which a rademacher - type theorem holds , when the source space is a doubling metric space , satisfying the poincar inequality , in short a pi space , @xcite . on the other hand , this result does not cover the pansu differentiability of lipschitz mappings , @xcite , that is a rademacher - type theorem between carnot groups .",
    "in fact , although here the target is finite dimensional , the difference arises from the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the notion of pansu differentiability .",
    "the first result in this work is an infinite dimensional version of almost everywhere pansu differentiability of lipschitz mappings , @xcite .",
    "in other words , we show that replacing pi spaces with carnot groups allows us to extend the family of targets for which we have a rademacher - type theorem .",
    "these targets are banach lie groups metrized by a suitable left invariant distance . in the commutative case",
    ", they also include the classical banach spaces , but their main feature is that the rnp is required only on a special closed subspace , that is the so - called _ horizontal subspace_. notice that in our banach lie groups this subspace is in general an infinite dimensional banach space .",
    "these lie groups can be naturally called _ banach homogeneous groups _ , since they are a straightforward generalization of their well known finite dimensional version . for the finite dimensional case",
    ", the reader can consult for instance @xcite .",
    "a simple way to present these infinite dimensional versions may consist in requiring the validity of the crucial properties that hold in the finite dimensional case , as the existence of a group operation with special structure , the existence of a homogeneous norm , along with dilations and so on .",
    "this presentation by axioms can be found in @xcite .    we follow a different approach , detecting these groups as _ graded nilpotent banach lie algebras _ , since all the above mentioned properties are just consequences , see section  [ sect : infdim ] .",
    "in fact , one can see a banach homogeneous group as a banach space @xmath1 equipped with a graded nilpotent lie product that turns it into a banach lie algebra .",
    "thus , we automatically get the group operation by the dynkin formula for the bch series , that locally converges in general banach lie algebras , @xcite .",
    "of course , in our case , this series is just a finite sum , that clearly everywhere converges , since we consider a nilpotent lie algebra .    in sum , we equip @xmath1 with three structures , since it is a banach space , a banach lie algebra and also banach lie group .",
    "its main feature is the decomposition into the direct sum @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are closed subspaces of @xmath1 , seen as banach spaces .",
    "this yields a precise gradation on the lie algebra structure of @xmath1 that allows us to introduce dilations @xmath4 , that are automatically group isomorphisms .",
    "furthermore , one can also construct a homogeneous norm on @xmath1 that respects both the group operation and dilations , hence defining the metric structure of @xmath1 , see section  [ sect : infdim ] for more details .",
    "as in the finite dimensional case , one can also define the special class of banach stratified groups , or carnot groups , since the additional condition that @xmath5 lie generates @xmath1 in the finite dimensional case @xcite , can be also stated in the infinite dimensional case .",
    "this was already pointed out in the seminal work by m. gromov , @xcite .",
    "however , we will focus our attention on the larger class of banach homogeneous group targets , that presents some additional difficulties in the proof of the almost everywhere differentiability of lipschitz mappings , as explained below .    several examples of infinite dimensional banach homogeneous groups will be presented in section  [ sect : infdim ] .",
    "we mainly exploit a natural product construction by means of the banach spaces @xmath6 of @xmath7-summable sequences .",
    "the simplest example of infinite dimensional banach homogeneous group is the well known heisenberg group modeled on @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a real hilbert space of scalar product @xmath10 . for any @xmath11 ,",
    "the group operation is defined as follows @xmath12 this product arises from the quantization relations of the heisenberg algebra realized in quantum mechanics , see for instance chapter xii , section 3 of @xcite .",
    "notice that this group has an underlying hilbert space structure . in subsection  [ infheis ]",
    ", we introduce the infinite product of heisenberg groups @xmath13 , whose underlying banach structure is given by @xmath14 . in subsection  [ infcarnot ]",
    "we present a construction to obtain an infinite product of the same carnot group .",
    "this provides many banach homogeneous groups whose underlying linear space is a genuinely infinite dimensional banach space and we will also see that we have some freedom in the choice of the banach topology .",
    "it is clear that one could use a similar construction also for products of different carnot groups .",
    "motivated by the simple case given by that arises from the heisenberg group of quantum mechanics , one might also expect further physical interpretations for special classes of banach homogeneous groups .",
    "we wish to clarify that the terminology `` carnot group '' will refer throughout to a finite dimensional group .",
    "the notion of differentiability in carnot groups has been introduced by p. pansu . in his celebrated 1989 work about the rigidity of both hyperbolic quaternionic spaces and of the cayley hyperbolic plane , he shows that a lipschitz mapping from an open set of a carnot group to another carnot group is almost everywhere differentiable , see @xcite . in definition  [ def : hdiff ]",
    "we recall this notion of differentiability in our framework .",
    "[ thm : pansudiff ] let @xmath1 be a banach homogeneous group such that its subspace @xmath5 has the rnp . if @xmath15 is any carnot group and @xmath16 , then any lipschitz mapping @xmath17 is almost everywhere differentiable .    if the target is either another carnot group or a finite dimensional graded lie group , then this theorem yields the known results on almost everywhere differentiability of lipschitz mappings .",
    "in fact , all finite dimensional linear spaces have the rnp .",
    "the proof theorem  [ thm : pansudiff ] follows an approach that differs from all the other approaches known to us .",
    "we only rely on a suitable application of the dynkin formula that gives an explicit expression for the addends appearing in the finite expansion of the group operation , @xcite .",
    "further technical difficulties arise from the fact that we consider a general subset of the carnot group @xmath15 . in theorem  [ the : hdiff ]",
    "we establish the almost everywhere differentiability of lipschitz curves taking values in @xmath1 , equipped with the metric structure of homogeneous group , and being defined on an arbitrary subset of the real line .",
    "this is a nontrivial fact , since lipschitz extensions of our curve , with respect to the homogeneous distance @xmath18 on @xmath1 , may not exist on an open interval .",
    "in fact , one can easily find finite dimensional homogeneous groups that are not connected by rectifiable curves .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by a suitable use of lipschitz extensions for banach - valued lipschitz curves .",
    "this result is due to w. b. johnson , j. lindenstrauss and g. schechtman , @xcite .",
    "another issue related to theorem  [ thm : pansudiff ] , may concern the actual existence of nontrivial lipschitz mappings .",
    "we wish to make sure that there are lipschitz mappings that are not a mere composition of a carnot group - valued lipschitz mapping with a lipschitz embedding into a banach homogeneous group . in subsection",
    "[ inflip ] , we construct lipschitz mappings that can not have the form previously described .",
    "in fact , we consider a suitable infinite product of a family of lipschitz mappings @xmath19 , under the condition that all vanish at some point .",
    "the corresponding product mapping @xmath20 turns out to be a lipschitz mapping taking values in @xmath13 . of course , in the case all mappings @xmath21 do not vanish at some point , the corresponding product mapping @xmath20 is an example of lipschitz mapping with _",
    "infinite dimensional image_. since the horizontal layer of @xmath13 has the rnp , our theorem  [ thm : pansudiff ] shows that @xmath20 is also almost everywhere differentiable , when the source space is any carnot group .",
    "it is worth to mention that all examples of banach homogeneous groups given in section  [ sect : infdim ] have the rnp , so in particular their horizontal subspace has also the rnp .",
    "the second part of this work is devoted to an area formula for a rather general class of metric space - valued lipschitz mappings , that also includes those of theorem  [ thm : pansudiff ] . for a general metric space target ,",
    "the choice of the source space is crucial .",
    "in fact , for metric space - valued lipschitz mappings defined on a subset of a euclidean space , b. kirchheim has established their almost everywhere metric differentiability and also the corresponding area formula , @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that carnot groups have a sufficiently rich structure to introduce the notion of metric differentiability , when any of their subsets constitutes the source space , see definition  [ def : metdif ] . in this case , the metric differential is given by a _",
    "homogeneous seminorm _ , namely a continuous function @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the additional condition that @xmath28 implies @xmath29 means that @xmath30 is a _",
    "homogeneous norm_.    on one side , when the source space is a noncommutative carnot group , such as the heisenberg group , then counterexamples to the metric differentiability of lipschitz mappings can be constructed , @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "if we restrict metric differentiability to horizontal directions , then we still have an almost everywhere ( horizontal ) metric differentiation for metric space - valued lipschitz mappings on carnot groups , @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm : pansudiff ] clearly provides new cases where metric space - valued lipschitz mappings on carnot groups are almost everywhere metrically differentiable .",
    "other novel targets where the almost everywhere metric differentiability holds can be found by another recent result of j. cheeger and b. kleiner , @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can notice that the seminorm @xmath31 of theorem  1.3 in @xcite can be seen as a homogeneous seminorm on the whole heisenberg group @xmath32 , therefore the limit in the statement of this theorem , with @xmath33 equal to the unit element , exactly yields the almost everywhere metric differentiability of lipschitz mappings from @xmath32 to @xmath34 , see also @xcite .",
    "we observe that in all previously mentioned cases , where the almost everywhere metric differentiability holds , one can apply the following new metric area formula .",
    "[ gmetarea ] let @xmath35 be measurable , let @xmath36 be lipschitz and almost everywhere metrically differentiable .",
    "it follows that @xmath37 where @xmath38 for all @xmath39 is the multiplicity function , @xmath40 is the homogeneous distance of @xmath15 , @xmath18 is the metric of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the hausdorff dimension of @xmath15 .    as usual ,",
    "the point of an area formula is its notion of jacobian .",
    "the _ metric jacobian _",
    "@xmath43 of the homogeneous seminorm @xmath30 is defined as follows @xmath44 if @xmath15 is a euclidean space , then yields the jacobian of @xcite .",
    "if the target is a banach homogeneous group @xmath1 equipped with a distance @xmath18 given by a homogeneous norm , then we have to observe that differentiability with differential @xmath45 implies metric differentiability with homogeneous seminorm @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we get a more explicit formula for , that in the special case @xmath1 is another carnot group fits into the sub - riemannian jacobian introduced in @xcite , see remark  [ rem : banhomj ] for more comments .    concerning the proof of , a substantial difference in our approach with respect to that of @xcite is in the proof of the negligibility of the image of points where the metric differential is not a homogeneous norm .",
    "in @xcite , this fact is achieved combining the integral representation of kirchheim s jacobian with the use of @xmath48-approximating graph extensions of the mapping , as in @xcite .",
    "it is somehow surprising that our argument is more elementary , since it only uses the definition of metric differentiability , according to lemma  [ lipnegl ] , without any use of the notion of metric jacobian .",
    "we should also mention that the area formula in carnot groups leads to an algebraic characterization of _ purely @xmath15-unrectifiable _ stratified groups , @xcite . a purely @xmath15-unrectifiable metric space",
    "@xmath49 has the property that the image of any @xmath41-valued lipschitz mapping from a subset of the @xmath42-dimensional carnot group @xmath15 has vanishing hausdorff measure @xmath50 .    as a byproduct of , for any fixed carnot group @xmath15 , a banach homogeneous group such that its horizontal subspace has the rnp is purely @xmath15-unrectifiable if none of its homogeneous subgroups is isomorphic to @xmath15 .",
    "the trivial case is that of a banach space with the rnp , that is clearly purely @xmath15-unrectifiable whenever @xmath15 is noncommutative .",
    "for instance , if @xmath15 has step higher than two , then any two step banach homogeneous group whose horizontal subspace has the rnp must be purely @xmath15-unrectifiable .",
    "clearly , other analogous cases could be conceived .",
    "we wish to clarify that in the preceding discussion , we have referred to the notion of isomorphism using the h - homomorphisms introduced in definition  [ hhom ] .",
    "finally , we remark that any metric space @xmath41 that is purely @xmath15-unrectifiable has in particular the property that the group @xmath15 can not admit any bi - lipschitz embedding into @xmath41 .",
    "this clearly provides new bi - lipschitz non - embeddability theorems with infinite dimensional target .",
