    "the study of nuclear properties at finite temperature is important for nuclear astrophysics , medium energy heavy ion collisions and future experiments at the rare isotope beam facility ( rib ) .",
    "it is also of general interest because of its relation to the study of strongly correlated fermions and to phase transitions in multi - component systems , and in particular to these studies in two component systems .",
    "density functional theory has been extensively used as an approach to such studies in many areas of many body physics . in nuclear physics density",
    "functional theory based on a skyrme interaction approach has been frequently used . here",
    "such an approach will be employed in our study of nuclear properties at finite non - zero temperature .",
    "most applications of density functional theory are for systems at @xmath1 .",
    "the nuclear system has terms that set it apart from other two component binary systems .",
    "these include coulomb terms from the charged proton component , symmetry terms from the nuclear symmetry energy , surface energy terms and momentum dependent terms from a velocity dependence of the nuclear interaction .",
    "questions related to nuclear stability should involve these terms since it is their interplay that determines important features .",
    "for example , fission processes are in part an interplay of surface versus coulomb interactions .",
    "the valley of nuclear stability in @xmath2 and @xmath3 involves an interplay of symmetry versus coulomb interactions .",
    "while the coulomb energy favors systems with large neutron excess in heavy nuclei , symmetry terms favor systems with equal number of protons and neutrons .",
    "nuclei far from the valley of nuclear stability up to neutron drip and proton drip lines are of interest in future rib experiments .",
    "moreover the coulomb force is long range and the nuclear force is short range and nearly charge independent .",
    "a charge independent nuclear interaction has an associated isospin sysmmetry .",
    "the presence of such terms in the interaction of nucleons make the nuclear case a unique binary system to study .",
    "moreover , realistic nuclei are finite and contain surface terms so that phase transitions in finite systems can be studied . in this paper",
    "we incorporate an additional isovector component in the momentum dependence of the interaction , extending our previous studies @xcite of properties of heated nuclei . in our previous work we considered an isoscalar momentum dependent term besides volume , surface ,",
    "non momentum dependent symmetry terms and coulomb interactions .",
    "a momentum dependent isovector term and related isovector effective mass effects are important in a study of properties associated with symmetry terms between protons and neutrons",
    ". how various terms in nuclear two component systems manifest themselves at non - zero temperature and how they affect the equation of state , compressibility , chemical and mechanical instability and associated liquid gas coexistence curve are investigated . without coulomb terms , the coexistence curve and chemical and mechanical instability curves are symmetric about proton fraction @xmath4 .",
    "however a stable nucleus such as pb@xmath5 at zero temperature has proton fraction @xmath6 far from being symmetric in proton number 82 and neutron number 126 .",
    "when coulomb terms are included a large asymmetry appears in curves associated with finite temperature properties .",
    "the symmetry terms partially restores the symmetry of the curves .",
    "we also extend our previous calculation by considering a commonly used skyrme interaction labeled sly4 and discuss its properties .",
    "the phase diagram of a one component system is a simple curve of pressure versus density determined by a maxwell construction .",
    "the phase structure in a binary system is considerably more complex than one component systems because of an extra degree of freedom associated with the additional component .",
    "the binodal surface is now determined by pressure , temperature and proton fraction",
    ". the proton fraction can be different in the denser liquid phase than the less dense gas phase because of the short range of the nuclear symmetry energy . in a nuclear two component system ,",
    "isospin fractionation @xcite is an example where the monomer gas has a large neutron excess .",
    "ref.@xcite is a recent reference that contains further references to isospin fractionation .",
    "the liquid gas phase transition was first treated as a one component system @xcite and later extended to two components @xcite using a skyrme interaction .",
    "ref.@xcite used a relativistic mean field model and studied the role of the symmetry energy on the phase structure in detail .",
    "inclusion of coulomb and surface terms can be found in refs.@xcite where large asymmetries were shown to appear from the coulomb term .",
    "pawlowski @xcite has also considered the role of the coulomb term .",
    "some further studies of the nuclear phase transition can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite also includes a discussion of momentum dependent terms , both isoscalar and isovector .",
    "our results will differ somewhat from those of ref.@xcite because we consider a coulomb term which leads to asymmetries in various quantities in proton fraction . without a coulomb interaction symmetry exists around a proton fraction @xmath4 for nuclear stability and for the coexistence loops .",
    "the importance of nuclear isospin symmetry in various features of heavy ion collisions can be found in refs.@xcite .    in sect .",

    "we see that simply changing these parameters changes various quantities given at the bottom of the table starting with the effective mass and ending with the compressibility .",
    "it should be noted that nuclear matter properties for the momentum independent interaction and the skm(@xmath0 ) are the same except for the symmetry energy .",
    "specifically , when two interactions have the same effective mass then the energy and pressure are the same in symmetric systems with the potential energy of the form of eq.([potene ] ) ( see eqs.(42 ) , ( 45 ) , and ( 46 ) of ref.@xcite ) . and thus the saturation properties will be the same .",

    "the chemical instability loops are inside of the coexistence loops and tangent to each other at the critical point , i.e. , the point with highest pressure on the coexistence curve .    in figs.[fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , the loops for the isovector momentum dependent case ( solid line ) has a cut at @xmath92 which is related with the spinodal behavior of @xmath67 curve for @xmath65 in fig.[fig1 ] . the smaller symmetry energy allows the system to be more asymmetric and thus to reach the boundary of @xmath65 or @xmath93 .",
    "the skm(@xmath0 ) force with both isoscalar and isovector momentum dependent terms has the smallest symmetry energy while the sly4 force has the largest symmetry energy among forces used here ( see table [ tabl1 ] ) .",

    "the pressure of the coexistence curve on the neutron rich side for a given value of @xmath50 ( fig.[fig5 ] ) becomes higher due to the momentum dependent isoscalar term ( dash - dotted line ) than the pressure for momentum independent interaction ( dashed line ) and also moves the peak to higher @xmath50 .",
    "by contrast the momentum dependent isovector term ( solid line ) makes the pressure lower and moves the peak to lower @xmath50 .",
    "the effects of isoscalar and isovector term work in opposite direction for the coexistence curve on the proton rich side compare to the effects for neutron rich side .",
    "for sly4 the system without an isovector or isoscalar momentum dependent term does not saturate at the usual normal density region .",
    "however , the isovetor momentum dependent term in sly4 has the same sign as the isoscalar momentum dependent term thus both isoscalar and isovector terms would make the pressure of the coexistence curve of neutron rich side higher than momentum independent case .",
    "this might also make the coexistence loop in neutron rich side larger than the loop in proton rich side . in fig.[fig6 ] the loops for the momentum dependent isoscalar case ( dash - dotted line ) is smallest and thus mostly inside among the loops while the loops for the momentum dependent isovector case ( solid line ) are largest and thus mostly outside .",
    "the loops for the momentum independent case ( dashed line ) are tangent to the loops for the momentum dependent case with both isoscalar and isovector terms ( solid line ) at @xmath4 where @xmath82 for both cases .",
    "the curves of @xmath63 ( thin curves in fig.[fig6 ] ) also show that the isovector momentum dependent term has an opposite and larger effect than the isoscalar momentum dependent term .",
    "a density functional theory based on a skyrme nuclear interaction is used to study the temperature dependent properties of a two component system of strongly interacting protons and neutrons .",
    "the paper extends our previous studies by including an isovector momentum dependent interaction . as before , coulomb and finite size surface effects",
    "are also contained in the description of various properties .",
    "the nuclear interaction has a velocity or momentum dependent term and in a medium this momentum dependence can be discussed as an effective mass to lowest order in it .",
    "the momentum dependence has both isoscalar and isovector terms .",
    "our prior study in ref.@xcite suppressed the isovector part by using a particular choice of skyrme parameters .",
    "this greatly simplified the original calculations of the stability and coexistence properties . here",
    "we now explore the mechanical and chemical instability of a two component system and also the coexistence features associated with a liquid gas phase transition incorporating an isovector momentum dependence besides other terms mentioned above .",
    "while qualitative results have a similar behavior with and without a momentum dependence ( isoscalar and isovector ) , significant quantitative differences exist .",
    "moreover , we extended our calculations to include the frequently used skyrme interaction called sly4 @xcite .",
    "each term , coulomb , volume , surface , symmetry , effective mass or momentum dependence , both isoscalar and isovector , play a unique role in determining the finite temperature stability properties and coexistence features as shown in various figures in this paper .",
    "for example , the coulomb interaction leads to a pronounced asymmetry in the coexistence loops shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "moreover the equal concentration point @xmath61 , where the liquid and gas have the same proton fraction , moves away from @xmath95 without coulomb forces to a point where the proton fraction is close to the valley of stability when coulomb forces are included .",
    "for example @xmath96 for a momentum independent force , 0.414 for a isoscalar momentum dependent force , 0.379 for a isovector momentum dependent force , and 0.402 for sly4 .",
    "the @xmath61 with coulomb included is somewhat insensitive to the nuclear force .",
    "however , the pressure at @xmath61 is more sensitive .",
    "specifically , @xmath97 mev/@xmath77 for momentum independent case , 0.0236 for isoscalar case , 0.0127 for isovector case , and 0.0262 for sly4 .",
    "a model with no coulomb terms would have identical loops in @xmath50 around the point of intersection @xmath95 of equal concentration .",
    "the sly4 interaction has the interesting property of making the left coexistence loop of lower proton fraction more pronounced than the right loop of high proton fraction .",
    "this particular feature in the height of the right versus left loop is not observed with the other skm(@xmath0 ) interaction discussed in this paper .",
    "in particular , the right loop is still more pronounced or higher than the left loop for skm(@xmath0 ) . for skm(@xmath0 ) , the isoscalar momentum dependent term raises the pressure of the coexistence loop on the neutron rich side while the isovector momentum dependent term , which has an opposite sign from the isoscalar term , lowers the pressure . for sly4 , both the isoscalar and isovector terms",
    "have the same sign and thus would raise the pressure of the coexistence loop on the neutron rich side .",
    "the sly4 has also a non zero effect from an isovector three body term which was zero for skm(@xmath0 ) . besides this feature the sly4 loop at higher @xmath50 side is narrower in @xmath50 for a given @xmath57 and @xmath47 than the skm(@xmath0 ) loops . from this observation",
    "we can conclude that the coexistence and stability behaviors are sensitive to the choice of skyrme interaction parameters .",
    "the sly4 has a higher symmetry energy than the other interactions used in this paper as shown in table [ tabl1 ] .",
    "moreover a higher left loop means that the liquid and gas phases can coexist at higher pressures at a given temperature with a more neutron rich gas and a lesser rich neutron liquid , i.e. , @xmath98 for the left loop .",
    "a narrowing of the coexistence loop brings the @xmath99 and @xmath100 closer together thereby reducing the proton fraction difference in the gas and liquid phases .    the momentum dependent isovector term in skm(@xmath0 )",
    "force has an opposite and larger effect than the momentum dependent isoscalar term .",
    "a momentum dependent isovector term makes the symmetry energy smaller and thus the coexistence loops and the mechanical and chemical instability loops become more asymmetric .",
    "the small value of symmetry energy for full momentum dependent interaction makes the @xmath50 value for a given @xmath49 and @xmath47 farther away from @xmath60 .",
    "the pressure for a given @xmath49 and @xmath50 at fixed @xmath57 becomes larger by the isoscalar momentum dependent term while it becomes smaller by the isovector momentum dependent term .",
    "symmetry energy terms arising from momentum independent and momentum dependent terms tend to restore the symmetry of the loops .",
    "the coexistence loops and instability loops for skm(@xmath0 ) with both isoscalar and isovector momentum dependent terms have the smallest symmetry energy",
    ". therefore they are the furthest away from @xmath61 for this force and thus have a cut due to the @xmath90 condition .",
    "this feature presents a problem for using an interaction with too small of a symmetry term in neutron star studies .",
    "the coexistence loops for sly4 , which has the largest symmetry energy , are closer to its @xmath61 than for the skm(@xmath0 ) parameter sets .",
    "this suggests that the large symmetry energy terms of the sly4 are very important in restoring the isospin symmetry in the system and also better in neutron star studies .",
