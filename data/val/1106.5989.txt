    "in theory , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a galaxy contains a wealth of information about both its evolutionary history and current conditions .",
    "however , extracting this information is difficult and requires the use of physically based models . nevertheless , sed fitting is a necessary process as many high redshift galaxies remain unresolved by our current instruments and any attempts to characterize the conditions and processes that lead to their starburst activities rely almost exclusively on their spatially averaged properties .",
    "these models of the integrated seds of galaxies currently cover a wide range of galaxy types , but are particularly dominated by models of starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) to far infrared ( fir ) sed of these _ starbursts _ is dominated by the energetic photons emitted by massive stars with typical lifetimes of less than 10@xmath1myr .",
    "in particular , the mid - infrared portion of the sed contains several important diagnostics that probe the physical conditions of starbursts.observations of a set of marginally resolved starburst galaxies with the spitzer space telescope show a broad range of mid - infrared properties , including different strengths of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) bands , thermal continuum slopes , depth of the silicate absorption features at 10@xmath1@xmath2  and 18@xmath1@xmath2  and intensity of nebular emission lines @xcite .",
    "all these signatures have contributions from different spatial regions , depending on the geometrical distribution of gas and dust with respect to the ionizing stars .",
    "for example , @xcite reported on the presence of compact star forming knots around the nucleus of the starburst galaxy arp 143 , and similar star forming knots have been reported near the nucleus of ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "in other galaxies , such as m51 , star formation spreads more uniformly over the galactic disk .",
    "the different distributions of gas , dust , and stars in galaxies affect the shape of the spatially integrated sed .",
    "inversely , a sophisticated and well calibrated sed model should be able to recover the information on the local starburst conditions from the integrated sed .",
    "a considerable amount of sed model libraries can be found in recent literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comprehensive review on sed fitting ) .",
    "these models generally make assumptions on the internal physics of galaxies and predict the output sed as a function of certain model parameters , such as star formation rates ( sfrs ) , metallicity ( z ) , and the interstellar medium ( ism ) pressure , density , and temperature , among many others .",
    "sed fitting refers to the process of choosing from a particular library the model solutions that best reproduce the data .",
    "while finding the best - fit model via , for an example , a @xmath3 minimization provides an estimate of the parameters , this method alone is insufficient to provide absolute parameter uncertainties . in order to obtain robust parameter estimates , including uncertainties",
    ", it becomes necessary to explore the whole parameter space and perform a statistical study of their correlations .",
    "we highlight four aspects that make this task difficult .",
    "first , the sensitivity of photometric and spectroscopic studies is limited not only by instrumental constraints , but also by more fundamental constrains such as shot noise in the case of weak sources .",
    "hence , the robustness of sed fitting depends on the data quality and on sufficient data coverage .",
    "second , degeneracies between model parameters are common , especially when limited to a narrow spectral window ( e.g. , the mid - infrared ) .",
    "third , independent determinations ( from observations or theory ) of the physical parameters against which we can confront our model results are rare for most starburst , hence making it difficult to calibrate the models . and last but not least , no robust fitting routine that leads to reproducible results has been established so far for the specific case of starburst spectra .    in this paper",
    "we present a bayesian fitting routine for the mid - infrared ( @xmath4@xmath2 ) spectra of starbursts that can be extended to other wavelengths .",
    "we derive probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the model parameters , and study the implications on the physics of starbursts . to calibrate this routine",
    "we apply it to the mid - infrared spectrum of the 30 doradus region in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the selection of this nearby starburst as a calibrator is natural , since its proximity ( @xmath5 ) allows us to differentiate spatially resolved sub - regions of the giant hii  region , and study their spectra separately .",
    "the well studied stellar populations , ionized gas , and dust content provide the necessary independent measurements to compare with sed fitting results .",
    "current spatial resolutions achieved with the mapping mode of the _ infrared spectrograph _ on board the spitzer space telescope are of the order of a few arcseconds at 5@xmath1@xmath2 corresponding to a scale of about one parsec at the distance to 30 doradus .",
    "even the next generation spectrometer operating at these wavelengths , the _ mid infrared instrument _",
    "( miri ) , on board the 6.5@xmath1 m james webb space telescope , will not be able to resolve typical giant hii  regions in galaxies located at distances larger than about 30  mpc at a nominal wavelength of 15@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "this highlights the importance of understanding the integrated seds of these objects .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : data ] we describe some general aspects of the 30 doradus region , focusing on its stellar content and its physical properties , as obtained from hst and spitzer observations , and we discuss the spitzer - irs spectral data that we model . in  [ sec : models ] we give a brief overview of the models we use to generate our grid of synthetic seds . in  [ sec : fitting ] we introduce our fitting routine and discuss the assumed priors and involved uncertainties . ",
    "[ sec : results ] presents the results of applying our fitting routine to 30 doradus , discuss the implications of the model parameters and the physical interpretation of the mid - infrared seds . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discusion ] we summarize our main findings .",
    "our choice of 30 doradus as a calibrator relies on three powerful reasons : _",
    "( i ) _ it is the largest giant hii  region in the local group , _ ( ii ) _ it is well studied across the whole electromagnetic spectrum , and _",
    "( iii ) _ it is close enough to be well resolved into individual components . in this section",
    "we describe the general properties of 30 doradus and the spectral data that we model .",
    "30 doradus is the most massive giant hii  region in the local group .",
    "it is located @xmath6kpc away @xcite , in the north - east part of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and includes the stellar cluster ngc 2070 , the cloud of ionized gas created by the ionizing radiation from ngc 2070 and dominated by its compact central core r136,and the photon - dissociated regions and molecular material associated with the star forming region .",
    "we show the complexity of the region in fig .",
    "[ fig:30dor_overview ] .",
    "r136 is the most dense concentration of stars in the local group , with an estimated stellar mass of @xmath7 contained within the innermost 5@xmath1pc @xcite .",
    "the associated hii  region has an h@xmath8 luminosity of @xmath9erg@xmath1s@xmath10 @xcite and a far - infrared luminosity of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "stellar winds , supernovae , and radiation pressure from the central cluster have excavated an expanding ionized bubble and created a complex filamentary structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:30dor_overview ] ) .",
    "this bubble , and other similar cavities in the region are filled with x - ray emitting gas at temperatures of @xmath12k , as revealed by observations with the chandra space observatory @xcite .",
    "a recent study of the optical emission lines shows no evidence of ionization by supernova - driven shocks found by a recent study@xcite , and hence the dominant excitation mechanism in the 30 doradus region is photoionization by the uv photons produced mainly in r136 .",
    "this was corroborated by a comparison of observed irs line fluxes with models of the mid - infrared lines @xcite .",
    "using hst spectroscopy , @xcite identified several non - coeval stellar populations in the 30 doradus region , and classified them as follows : _",
    "( i ) _ a core - ionizing phase ( r136 ) , with an age of 2 - 3  myr ; _ ( ii ) _ a peripheral triggered phase , with an age of @xmath13  myr ( this population has also been identified using near infrared excess measurements , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; _ ( iii ) _ a phase of ob supergiants with an age of 6  myr ; _ ( iv ) _ the hodge 301 cluster , @xmath14 nw of r136 , with an age of @xmath15  myr , and _ ( v ) _ the r143 ob association , with ages between 4 - 7  myr .",
    "an interesting aspect of 30 doradus is its structure of bubbles and filaments .",
    "observations of galactic and extragalactic regions have revealed expanding structures of ionized gas driven by stellar winds and supernova activity from the ob stellar population . in the particular case of 30 doradus ,",
    "expanding supershells have been detected with diameters between 2 and 20@xmath1pc and expansion velocities of 100 - 300@xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of 30 doradus and of the lmc in general is sub - solar ( @xmath16 ) @xcite . due to this low metallicity environment ,",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio in the lmc is about 30% lower than in the milky way ( see review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and the system allows us to investigate the effect of uv radiation in lower metallicity environments as compared to our own galaxy .    for simplicity ,",
    "in this paper we refer to 30 doradus as the region of @xmath17pc@xmath18arcmin in diameter in projection centered in r136 .",
    "the spitzer - irs spectral data that we model here has been extensively discussed in @xcite , as part of the spitzer general observer program _ stellar feedback on circumcluster gas and dust in 30 doradus , the nearest super - star cluster _ , ( pid 30653 , p.",
    "i. r. indebetouw ) .",
    "it consists of four data cubes obtained by mapping the 30 doradus region with the two low - resolution slits of the irs ( `` short - low '' and `` long - low '' ) in each of their two spectral orders . for reference ,",
    "the first order of the short - low ( sl1 ) map covers an area of @xmath19pc , and includes a significant portion of the 30 doradus emission nebula .",
    "the wavelength coverage is between 5 - 38@xmath1@xmath2  with a resolving power @xmath20 , varying from 60 at the short wavelength end to about 110 at the long wavelength end .",
    "exposure times were of the order of 150@xmath1s per slit position .",
    "spectra of chosen regions are extracted using the cubism software package @xcite .",
    "once the sky subtraction has been performed , we extract individual spectra using a resolution element of @xmath21 sl1 pixels for all orders .",
    "this corresponds to an angular resolution of @xmath22 arcseconds , and a physical spatial resolution of roughly 1  pc at the distance to the lmc . to create the spatially integrated spectrum of 30 doradus , we co - add the spectra of all individual resolution elements within an area of about @xmath23pc ( the magenta square in fig .",
    "[ fig:30dor_rgb_map ] ) .",
    "we show the resulting integrated spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_spectra ] .",
    "the integrated spectrum is dominated by emission from nebular lines and the thermal continuum , while the pah emission is generally weak in the region .    here",
    "we express all fluxes as @xmath24 in units of erg@xmath1s@xmath10 . to convert from the mjy@xmath25 units from the irs pipeline , we multiply the fluxes by the aperture area of 13.7 arcsec@xmath26 , and assume a distance to 30 doradus ( lmc ) of @xmath27kpc @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:30dor_rgb_map ] we have indicated four locations defined in table [ tab : regions ] , of which we show their respective spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_spectra ] .",
    "these locations include sources of different nature and were chosen to cover a broad range of physical conditions and spectral shapes .",
    "we model their spectra separately to study the validity of the models in environments which are dominated by either highly ionized gas or by embedded stars .",
    "source 1 corresponds to the location of the young ob cluster r136 .",
    "the emission here is dominated by uv and optical photons and shows little infrared emission from pahs .",
    "source 2 is a yso candidate selected from irac colors @xcite , according to the criterion suggested by @xcite , about 1 arcminute southwest of r136 , at the ionized southern edge of the main bubble - like structure , in a region with significant [ ] 10.5@xmath1@xmath2  emission .",
    "its spectrum has a smooth thermal continuum with no sign of pah emission , bu with the typical nebular lines [ ] 12.81@xmath1@xmath2 , [ ] 15.56@xmath1@xmath2 , and [ ] 18.71@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "source 3 is a bright infrared source outside of the main bubble , to the north - west of the cluster .",
    "its spectrum shows prominent pah emission features and a deep silicate absorption feature at 10@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "source 4 is an infrared source identified as a protostellar object by @xcite , just outside the main bubble , north of r136 .",
    "it coincides with a strong peak of [ ] emission and is also an x - ray source .",
    "@xcite even consider this source to be a supernova remnant , but also point to its higher h@xmath8/h@xmath28 ratio and the possibility of it being an hii  region with an extinction higher than average .",
    "lccc    source 1 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & r136 + source 2 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & yso candidate + source 3 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & high extinction ( @xmath35 ) + source 4 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & protostar , [ ] emission + [ tab : regions ]    in general , we observe that emission from all pah bands is weak towards 30 doradus as compared to other starburst systems ( see , for example the starburst sed template in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the 17@xmath1@xmath2  pah complex generally associated with out - of - band bending modes of large neutral pah grains @xcite is only marginally detected in our spectra . a remarkable result regarding this point",
    "is that the 17@xmath1@xmath2  complex is weaker towards source 3 than expected from the proportionality relations that have been empirically derived between different pah bands @xcite .",
    "this proportionality implies that in starburst galaxies the equivalent width of the 11.3@xmath1@xmath2  feature is about twice the equivalent width of the 17@xmath1@xmath2  feature @xcite .",
    "if this were to hold also for our source 3 , we would expect a flux density of the 17@xmath1@xmath2  20% higher than the thermal continuum at this wavelength .",
    "however , our data indicates an upper limit for the 17@xmath1@xmath2  emission of only 2% above the continuum level .",
    "this suppression of the 17@xmath1@xmath2  band can have several interpretations .",
    "a possibility is that the pah molecules are not neutral in this region of 30 doradus .",
    "however , source 3 is outside of the main ionized bubble shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:30dor_rgb_map ] , and hence we do not expect a high ionization state of the pahs in this region .",
    "metallicity variations could also account for a change in the relative strength of the 17@xmath1@xmath2  feature @xcite , but even in very low metallicity environments an extremely weak 17@xmath1@xmath2  would also imply a weak 11.3@xmath1@xmath2  feature , which we do not observe .",
    "we are left with the explanation of grain size effects .",
    "as mentioned , emission features between 15@xmath1@xmath2  and 20@xmath1@xmath2  are associated with large pah grains , typically containing @xmath38 carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "wether the conditions in 30 doradus are unfavorable for the formation of large pah grains is the mater of a subsequent paper .",
    "the simplest spectral energy distribution models consider a starburst as a single spherical hii  region surrounding a central ionizing cluster , use stellar synthesis for the stellar radiation and solve the radiative transfer for dust and gas in spherical geometry .",
    "these semi - empirical attempts use observations of specific objects , such as star - forming dwarf galaxies @xcite or nuclear starbursts @xcite to constrain the model parameters .",
    "they are successful in reproducing the photometry , and to some extent the ir spectra of these objects , but are limited to a narrow range of physical conditions ( e.g. , only two orders of magnitude in dust density ) .",
    "fully theoretical models , such as the ones proposed by @xcite , make similar assumptions on geometry , dust properties and stellar synthesis , and cover a broader range of physical properties to model a larger sample of starburst galaxies , but ignore spatial variations of the parameters .",
    "more sophisticated models consider the starburst as a collection of individual hii  regions with different ages and environments , whose seds add up to produce the total galactic sed . in the grasil models , for example ,",
    "each of these individual regions is assumed to have different physical properties @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they do not allow for the dynamical evolution of the expanding shell - like structures such as the ones we have described in ",
    "[ sec : properties ] . in the expanding mass - loss bubble scenario ,",
    "the time - dependent radius and external pressure of the hii  region are controlled by the mechanical luminosity from the newborn stars @xcite , and have a strong influence on the shape of the sed , as they control the gas and dust geometry @xcite .",
    "none of the existing starburst models simultaneously accounts for both the multiplicity of hii  regions in a starburst system and their time evolution as individual hii  regions evolve as mass - losing bubbles .",
    "however , the models described in the series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( d&g models hereafter ) , represent a step forward in our theoretical description of starburst systems , by including these two aspects in a self - consistent way .",
    "although these models have been successfully applied to the seds of a variety of objects , such as brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) @xcite , no systematic study of the model degeneracies have been presented . in the remainder of this section",
    "we briefly describe the underlying physics of the d&g models , emphasizing the aspects that are relevant for our discussion , and connect this description to the controlling model parameters . for a detailed description of the model ,",
    "we refer the reader to the dopita & groves paper series .",
    "the d&g models compute the sed of a starburst galaxy as the sum of the seds of individual expanding hii  regions , averaged over ages younger than 10@xmath1myr . by this age , over @xmath39 of the total ionizing photons produced during the main sequence stage of the massive stars have been emitted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the non - ionizing uv flux is rapidly decreasing as the ob stars evolve off the main sequence into supernovae . here",
    "we will test the applicability of the individual hii  regions that constitute the building blocks of the models .",
    "each individual giant hii  region evolves in time as a bubble expanding into the surrounding ism , driven by the stellar winds and supernova from the central cluster .",
    "the dynamical evolution is controlled by the equations of motion of the expanding bubble @xcite and provides the instantaneous distance of the ionization front , dust and molecular gas with respect to the central cluster .",
    "the time - dependent expansion of this mass - loss bubble controls the temperature of the dust and the ionization state of the gas in the hii  region , altering the shape of the sed .",
    "the stellar synthesis code starburst99 @xcite provides the stellar radiation field for a population of stars at a given age and metallicity .",
    "the energy output is normalized to a template cluster , whose mass is a free parameter of the models and can be scaled to any desired value .",
    "the stellar mass in the cluster is distributed according to a kroupa imf with a lower cutoff at 0.1@xmath40 and an upper cutoff of 120@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the photoionization code mappingsiii @xcite provides a self consistent treatment of both the dust physics ( photoelectric heating , dust absorption and emissivity properties , etc . ) and the ism physics , returning both line and continuum emission .",
    "the dust surrounding the cluster is considered to have contributions from three components : a population of carbonaceous grains with a power law size distribution ; a population of silicate grains with the same size distribution ; and a population of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , whose emission is represented by a template based on irs observations of ngc4676 and ngc7252 , both interacting galaxies with strong pah emission @xcite .",
    "stochastic heating is taking into account , and the maximum grain size of the distribution is @xmath41@xmath2 .",
    "the radiative transfer is calculated for two physical situations .",
    "the first one considers the region only and follows the uv photons as they traverse the wind - blown bubble , heat the dust and ionize the atomic hydrogen until the boundary of the ionization front .",
    "the second one assumes a covering photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) around the hii  region , with a hydrogen column density of @xmath42 ( an @xmath43 at solar metallicity ) .",
    "the individual model seds are calculated at a discrete set of ages between 0 and 10@xmath1myrs , with a resolution of 0.5@xmath1myrs , and the final integrated sed is calculated as the age - averaged energy output of the process .",
    "in  [ sec : results ] we will use both the integrated models and the single hii  region models to interpret the observed integrated spectrum of 30 doradus .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming two different approaches for the star formation history ( sfh ) of th region : an instantaneous burst of a given age , and a constant sfh over the last 10@xmath1myrs .",
    "30 doradus , although dominated by the single star formation event that created r136 , is neither morphologically nor spectroscopically a `` single '' hii  region , and hence both of these simplifying assumptions should be tested to encircle the problem .      the global parameters that represent the general assumptions of the d&g models and that remain fixed by construction are those describing the overall geometry , the stellar imf , the dust properties , and the pah molecules .",
    "in the following we describe the parameters that are free to vary in the d&g models . to reduce our parameter space and focus our analysis , in our fitting process",
    "we will keep a few of these parameters constant based on previous knowledge of the region .",
    "the free parameters are : the starburst metallicity ( z ) , the ism thermal pressure ( @xmath44 ) , the cluster mass ( @xmath45 ) , the compactness ( @xmath46 ) , the pdr fraction ( @xmath47 ) , and the mass contained in embedded objects ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we fix the value of this parameter to @xmath49 , which we consider a good average of several estimates using , for example , vlt observations of rr lyrae star and cepheid variables @xcite or modelling of chemical abundances in the lmc @xcite .",
    "metallicity variations are expected for other extragalactic starburst environments , but the well established sub - solar metallicity of the lmc helps reducing the parameter space here .",
    "this parameter describes the ambient ism pressure that opposes the expansion of the mass - loss bubble . from a comparison between fir line ratios in a sample of star - forming galaxies measured with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and pdr models by @xcite",
    ", @xcite derived thermal pressures of the order of @xmath50 . the spatial resolution achieved by iso implies that , in most cases , this value corresponds to the thermal pressure averaged over the entire galaxy .",
    "while we acknowledge that @xmath51 seems high for the average pressure of the lmc , we consider it a reasonable estimate near 30 doradus , where gas densities have been boosted up by earlier star formation events . on the high pressure end",
    ", @xmath52 is constrained by the pressure of the ionized x - ray emitting gas inside the bubble excavated by radiation pressure near r136 , which has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we thus fix @xmath51 in our models .",
    "the model seds scale in flux according to the total stellar mass contained in the star clusters . for an age - averaged model , averaged over the last 10@xmath1myr",
    ", the scaling relates to the total mass of stars formed during that period of time , and hence the derived mass is interpreted as a star formation rate ( sfr , in @xmath54 ) , while for a model of a single cluster with a given age ( our test case ) , the scaling relates to the cluster mass , @xmath45 .",
    "for all cases , however , it is assumed that stochastic effects within the imf are limited , and that the stellar population samples the full range of stellar masses .",
    "the d&g models introduce the compactness parameter , @xmath46 , resulting from the combination of the ism ambient pressure @xmath55 and the cluster mass @xmath45 .",
    "this dimensionless parameter characterizes the distribution of the ism with respect to the ionizing stars and is based on a constant heating flux input to the stars .",
    "intuitively , it describes how close the dust is distributed to the ionizing stars as a function of the cluster mass and hence it controls the temperature distribution of the dust and the far - ir shape of the sed .",
    "@xmath46 is proportional to the time - averaged cluster luminosity and inversely proportional to the time - averaged square of the swept - up bubble radius . as described in d&g",
    ", we can define the compactness as :    @xmath56    where @xmath45 is the cluster mass , @xmath55 is the ambient ism pressure and @xmath57 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the pressure parameter @xmath44 relates to the ambient thermal pressure ( or equivalently , the density ) of the surrounding ism .      as mentioned above , the d&g models explore two cases : a fully exposed hii  region ( i.e.  the ism ends at the ionization front ) , and an hii  region that is completely covered by the pdr in projection , with @xmath58 . in reality",
    ", a star forming region will have a mix of both pdr emission and direct hii  emission , which we approximate by the combination of the two extreme cases , parametrized by the fraction @xmath47 : @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the monochromatic flux arising from the star forming region , while @xmath61 and @xmath62 correspond respectively to the fluxes calculated for the pdr - fully covered case and the hii  region - only case .",
    "@xmath63 implies that there is no pdr material left around the ionized region , while @xmath64 implies a fully pdr - covered hii  region . in this fully - covered case",
    ", the pdr absorbs all of the non - ionizing uv continuum and re - radiates it at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we expect a considerable contribution from a population of massive protostars to the mid - infrared sed of hii  regions and starbursts , due to triggered and ongoing star formation . at the early stages of star formation ,",
    "the young objects are in a protostar or ultra - compact hii  phase , deeply buried in dust envelopes . from an observational point of view , and given the age resolution of the models , these two types of objects are indistinguishable . to account for them ,",
    "the models include a population of uchiirs @xcite . in terms of the sed",
    ", these models add a component of hot dust at around 25@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "we parametrize this contribution by scaling it to the desired mass , @xmath48 .",
    "the models include an attenuation factor to account for additional absorption of uv light by foreground diffuse dust .",
    "this factor is important in the modelling of starburst galaxies , where there is significant diffuse material along the line of sight but not associated with the star - forming regions .",
    "the adopted extinction curve is derived by @xcite and resembles a calzetti extinction law , which is exponential .",
    "the incoming flux is corrected for extinction as : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the column density of dust that gives a certain @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the dust attenuation cross section . based on radio continuum observations , @xcite find an extinction of @xmath69 mag towards the 30 doradus region . in a recent paper , @xcite find a reddening towards 30 doradus of e(v - i)@xmath70 mag , corresponding to a similar extinction .",
    "we expect individual sources to have higher extinction values within 30 doradus , with individual protostars having values of @xmath67 up to 4.0 magnitudes .",
    "hence for consistency we use here an average value of @xmath71 .",
    "we introduce here a bayesian fitting routine for the mid - infrared sed of a starburst , either individual starbursts such as 30 doradus , or entire starburst galaxies .",
    "this routine can be easily extended to include other wavelength ranges , and can be used for any observed spectrum that is expected to be within the defined parameter space .",
    "we consider each model parameter as a random variable with an associated probability distribution function ( pdf ) . rather than just minimizing the @xmath3 value to find the best fitting model , we solve for the probability distribution function of each of the model parameters .",
    "in recent years , bayesian analysis has been used in a number of different fields of astrophysics , where an attempt was made to reproduce a limited amount of data with multi - parameter models .",
    "some of the applications of bayesian methods in the determination of best fit parameters include photometric redshifts @xcite , observational cosmology @xcite and dusty tori around active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "we fit the integrated spectrum of 30 doradus and the individual locations in table [ tab : regions ] using a grid of the d&g models parametrized by the quantities described in  [ sec : models ] . in determining the best fit we use @xmath3-minimization , where the reduced @xmath3 is given by @xmath72    with the sum performed over all wavelength bins @xmath73 .",

    "with regard to the modelling this error is similar to an uncertainty in the distance to the object , and affects mainly luminosity - based estimates , such as the derived sfr or stellar mass . * the relative flux calibration .",
    "this refers to response variations within the given spectral range , often from one resolution element to the next one and is the equivalent of a `` flat field '' . from the typical differences between spectra of high signal - to - noise , taken at two different locations within the same slit",
    ", we estimated this uncertainty to be about @xmath96 . with regard to the modelling this error limits the weight that can be given to individual spectral features , and is thus a fundamental limitation to the achievable accuracy . * systematic errors due to the specific observing conditions .",
    "this uncertainty includes observational jitter , drifts and source ( de-)centering , which may lead to a wavelength dependent change in the overall sed slope .",
    "it also includes the amount of radiation that is external to the source of interest but picked up by the slit , e.g. , from the diffuse interstellar radiation field or another nearby source .",
    "+ flux calibration of a slit spectrum can assume that the source is a point source , and multiply by the fraction of the point source outside of the slit , which corresponds to a wavelength - dependent `` slit loss correction factor '' .",
    "alternately one can assume that the intrinsic distribution of emission is spatially flat , so the same amount of light is lost from the slit as re - enters it from a neighbouring point on the sky .",
    "_ cubism _ assumes the latter .",
    "neither extreme is correct , and it results in a systematic flux uncertainty that scales nonlinearly with brightness . + in addition , many adjacent spectral features , measured with the low resolution irs modules , will be blended together .",
    "this is most evident for the blending of the [ ] 12.81@xmath1@xmath2  line and the 12.7@xmath1@xmath2  pah feature .",
    "some of these systematic uncertainties vary in time , location on the slit and wavelengths , and are extremely hard to quantify .",
    "hence , we do not attempt to quantify them but we need to keep these additional uncertainties in mind .    furthermore",
    ", many distinct spectral features , such as the nebular emission lines , contain information on the physical conditions of the ism which is complementary to the information that can be derived from the dust continuum .",
    "one might thus consider assigning these distinct wavelengths a larger weight ( i.e. , smaller error ) in the fitting with respect to the more numerous continuum bins .",
    "however , these line fluxes are difficult to model very accurately , and a larger weight combined with some mismatch between observed spectrum and model may dominate the @xmath3-minimization routine and lead to an incorrect local maximum in the pdf .",
    "one could alos consider a very sophisticated fitting procedure where each resolution element gets its unique uncertainty ( i.e. , weight ) assigned , taking all the above mentioned error contributions .",
    "however , we consider this approach practically impossible to reach our main goal , namely the provision of a reliable modelling procedure that yields reproducible results . from the above arguments it is evident that any total uncertainty ( which will be used as weight in the @xmath3 fitting ) has to be larger than the error in the relative flux calibration , but will likely be smaller than the absolute flux uncertainty .",
    "our tests have shown that a flux uncertainty of 10% for all irs resolution elements leads to meaningful and robust results .",
    "hence , we adopt an error of 10% per irs resolution element .",
    "however , the above stated values only hold for the bright source limit ( bsl ) of the irs , which corresponds to a s / n ratio of about 10 ( _ irs instrument handbook _ ) . for dim sources with s / n @xmath97 , statistical variations in the number of detected photons ( i.e. , shot noise ) dominate the uncertainties , and our 10% uncertainty estimate no longer holds .",
    "other noise sources , such as noise from the detector read out and dark current come into play , and we need a more conservative error estimate . for all spectral resolution elements with s / n @xmath97 we use the rms variations of the spectrum between adjacent positions in the spectral map . for each location",
    "we extract the spectra of the four nearest resolution elements . from these five locations",
    "we calculate the average and rms deviations for each spectral resolution element , and replace our standard 10% uncertainty for the bsl by the rms value for that spectral element .",
    "there is a difference between the wavelength bin size of the models and the resolution element of the spitzer - irs .",
    "the resolving power of the irs ranges between 60 - 110 , and hence a typical resolution element is of the order of 0.1@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , for the models we have a wavelength step size that increases logarithmically with wavelength , and varies from 0.05@xmath1@xmath2  at @xmath98@xmath2  to 1@xmath1@xmath2  at 40@xmath1@xmath2 , but includes local variations to resolve important line features .",
    "therefore , we have re - binned the irs spectral data to match the lower spectral resolution of the models , by averaging the fluxes of the data bins corresponding to the same model bin .",
    "the uncertainty of the resulting bins , on the other hand , are calculated as the square root of the quadratic addition of the uncertainties of the original irs resolution elements .",
    "this propagation of error with the binning also prevents the uncertainties in the long - wavelength bins to dominate the fit .",
    "in this section we present and discuss the results of our fitting routine applied to the integrated spectrum of 30 doradus , and subsequently also to selected subregions within 30 dor .",
    "the latter have been added ( see also sections 2.3 and 5.3 ) to probe the validity and limitations of our starburst models on regions whose spectra are dominated by one type of source ( e.g. , an ob cluster or a protostar ) .    in the following subsection we compare the results on the integrated starburst spectrum of 30 dor , using three different approaches for comparison : _ ( i ) _ fitting all resolution elements of the entire @xmath99 m spectrum , _ ( ii ) _ fitting the continuum bins only , i.e. , excluding the fine - structure emission lines , and _ ( iii ) _ deriving the stellar ages from the irs high resolution lines only .",
    "we will show how sensitive the results depend on the spectral information provided .",
    "we then compare the best fit results on the integrated 30 dor spectrum with the results on the subregions .",
    "finally , we discuss how the results would change if we would not assume a single age burst but an age averaged model .",
    "the collection of emission lines in the mid - infrared wavelength range of the irs are sensitive diagnostics of ages of massive ob stars and to the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "they have the advantage of suffering little from obscuration and hence allow us to probe the conditions of deeply buried regions . in particular , the [ ] @xmath100m/[]@xmath101 m and the [ ] @xmath102m/[]@xmath103 m line ratios are good diagnostics of the ionization state of the gas , and hence provide a good constraint on the age of the ionizing cluster through measuring the hardness of the radiation field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the lores lines have a larger flux uncertainty , and hence a good consistency check is to compare the results we get from the routine with results derived from the hires lines .",
    "we use the hires nebular line fluxes presented in @xcite as a reference for the estimation of cluster age and ionization parameter and compare the results with what we obtain from the sed fitting for the four individual sources of table [ tab : regions ] .",

    "however , the @xcite models use a much simpler geometry ( namely plane - parallel instead of spherical ) , demonstrating much more clearly how the degeneracy between the hardness of the radiation field ( i.e.  stellar cluster age ) and the ionization parameter , q ( the ratio of the ionizing photon density to gas density ) , is broken using four strong mid - infrared emission lines .",

    "a quick comparison between the two cases reveals that the inclusion of the lines not only selects one of the two degenerate peaks , but also helps the best fit values to converge towards the absolute maximum of the pdf .",
    "this is particularly evident for the mass - age degeneracy , where the continuum - only fit favors an older age solution , while the inclusion of the lines shifts the probability maximum to an age that is in agreement with independently measured values .",

    "hot dust in starbursts may also be found in other environments and , hence , the amount of `` embedded objects '' derived from our fits can only be considered as an _ upper limit _ on the amount of protostars and uchirs .",
    "second , the contribution of this embedded component to the total emission at @xmath108@xmath2  may be surprisingly high but is not unreasonable .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : best_fit_pos](a ) and [ fig : best_fit_pos](b ) , which show the fits to source 1 ( r136 , the main cluster ) and source 2 ( a protostar , or group of protostars ) .",
    "while @xmath45 ( stars + hii  region + pdr ensemble ) is at least one order of magnitude larger in the case of r136 than in the embedded region , the contribution of the embedded component is much higher for the protostar in comparison , and so are the observed flux densities over most of the irs spectral range . while r136 contributes most of the stellar mass , much less massive components described as `` embedded objects '' contribute the majority of the mid - ir flux .",
    "in other words , the fact that the integrated flux in 30 doradus is dominated by this embedded component does not imply that there is a similar mass contribution from this embedded component .",

    "furthermore , despite the uncertainty in the nature of the embedded component , we will show in section 5.4 that the star formation rate in 30 dor derived from our modelling approach does _ not _ overestimate the `` true '' star formation rate as derived from integrated panchromatic seds that include the far - ir .",
    "additionally , the application of our routine to starburst galaxies shows that this component of embedded objects does not dominate the mid - infrared emission for these galaxies , as it does for 30 doradus .",

    "no other location in our spectral map shares these characteristics as an individual source . on the other hand ,",
    "low compactness is derived for sources where the simultaneous presence of bright stars and dust can be inferred , as it is the case of sources 1 , 2 and 3 .    we conclude that , even though our models are not intended to model these individual sources , we can nonetheless learn from the compactness parameter , as defined in  [ sec : models_brent ] , by comparing the results of the routine applied to them .",

    "this is consistent with the expected absence or low abundance of pdr material very close to the ionizing cluster .",
    "there are two important caveats that we must consider in the interpretation of the pdr covering fraction .",
    "first , we have not included here emission from diffuse dust , not associated with the starburst ( i.e.   heated by the interstellar radiation field ) ; this adds both cold dust and pah emission .",
    "second , there exists a degeneracy between the covering fraction of pdr material and the cluster mass in the mid - infrared ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_pdfs_int ] ) , due to the fact that pdr regions not only add pah emission , but also continuum emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "this translates in the apparent mismatch between the pdfs and the best fit values for these two parameters in table [ tab : bestfitpos ] .",
    "the degeneracy found for the integrated spectrum of 30 doradus that leads to the two possible solutions of an old , massive cluster or a young cluster with a smaller mass is indicative that not even 30 doradus can be considered as a single coeval stellar population .",
    "as described in the introduction , a number of spectroscopically identified populations have been identified in 30 doradus , and the fact that the continuum is compatible with two different sets of parameters leads us to the conclusion that a simple , single - age approach might be inaccurate even for our benchmark hii  region .",
    "thus we also carry out the sed fitting using an age - averaged model .",
    "we have fitted the integrated spectrum of 30 dor using the age - average model described in  [ sec : models_brent ] , where the sed is integrated over the 010@xmath107 lifetime of the ionizing stars . in this case",
    ", the cluster age is no longer a free model parameter , and we can interpret the absolute flux scaling as the sfr instead of a single cluster mass . we keep the ism pressure ( @xmath44 ) and the metallicity ( @xmath145 ) fixed to the same values as for the single age case .",
    "the best fit parameters we calculate in this way must be interpreted as average values over the time span covered by the models .",
    "[ fig : bf_age_average ] shows the resulting best fit to the data with the age - average model , and table [ tab : age_average ] lists the best - fit parameters with the associated uncertainties derived from the pdfs .",
    "cc    @xmath84 & @xmath146 + @xmath47 & @xmath147 + @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) & @xmath150 + @xmath151 & @xmath152 +    [ tab : age_average ]    here we use the parameter @xmath151 instead of @xmath48 .",
    "it refers to the ratio of mass contained in embedded objects to the mass of main sequence stars for objects younger than 10@xmath1myr , and hence it is related to the amount of currently ongoing star formation . in other words",
    ", @xmath151 gives the fraction of embedded / uchii luminosity - weighted contribution that we have to add to the sed to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "if @xmath153 , there is no current star formation happening , whereas if @xmath154 , half of the massive stars formed over the last million year are still in a embedded state . since this contribution is integrated over a period of 1@xmath1myr only , adding embedded objects also implies that the average sfr has to be modified according to :    @xmath155    where @xmath156 is the effective sfr that accounts for the additional population of embedded objects , and @xmath157 is the ratio of the total time over which the starburst has been modelled ( 10@xmath1myr ) and the estimated duration of the embedded phase ( 1@xmath1myr ) .",
    "for our best fit case , we get @xmath158 and @xmath159 , which implies that among the stars younger than 1@xmath1myr , there are about three times more embedded objects than main sequence objects .",
    "hence , the effective sfr is @xmath160 .",
    "the lmc has a sfr of 0.1@xmath161 @xcite . keeping in mind that this is only a lower limit estimate , given the incompleteness of any yso catalogue",
    ", our result implies that between 3% and 10% of the star forming activity of the lmc takes place in the 30 doradus region . to see how this compares to estimates of the sfr in 30 doradus from single photometric measurements , we compare the iras flux at 25@xmath1@xmath2  for the entire lmc to the 64@xmath1pc@xmath16263@xmath1pc area from which we have extracted the spectrum of 30 dor .",
    "the total flux density from the lmc at @xmath163@xmath2  is @xmath164jy @xcite . from our integrated spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all_spectra ] ) , we derive a monochromatic flux density of @xmath165 jy for the same wavelength , which corresponds to 24% of the total lmc flux density . assuming this wavelength directly traces star formation",
    ", it suggests that our value is close , but may be underestimated by a factor of two .",
    "the compactness and fraction of pdr results are consistent in both the single age case and the age average case .",
    "significant progress in our understanding of starburst systems has been made over the past decades , both on the observational and theoretical side . a huge amount of spectral data on star forming",
    "regions and starburst galaxies has been collected with iso , spitzer and the herschel space telescopes , complemented by a considerable library of sed models that predict the energy output of starbursts as a function of wavelength .",
    "however , sed fitting of starburst has mainly focused on maximum likelihood methods , which generally overlook degeneracies between physical parameters and lead to results that are not unique .",
    "furthermore , these ad hoc approaches often depend on some hidden assumptions that make the results reproducible . in this paper",
    ", we presented a routine to fit the seds of starbursts based on the models proposed in the series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we verified the accuracy and limitations of our approach by comparison between the model fit results and the known properties of the well - studied , prototypical giant hii  region 30 doradus .",
    "our main findings are :    * our modelling procedure is able to fit a broad range of continuum slopes , pah intensities , and emission lines .",
    "although we have only used the mid - infrared spectra for the calibration , the method can be easily expanded to other wavelength ranges .",
    "* we have verified the validity of our approach by comparison with the well studied 30 doradus region .",
    "the derived physical parameters , such as cluster mass , cluster age , ism pressure and pdr content , are in good agreement with the known properties of this nearby starburst .",
    "* we have provided a detailed study of the model degeneracies in the mid - infrared window of the spectrum , and have shown that the best fit values to the continuum shape are driven by a triple luminosity - age - compactness degeneracy that , in general , leads to multiple `` best fits '' . * the inclusion of emission lines in the analysis breaks this degeneracy .",
    "it is expected that the addition of other wavelength ranges would further constrain the model parameters . in particular , the precise location of the peak of the dust emission in the far - infrared is crucial to constrain the compactness parameter .",
    "herschel spectroscopy , as well as mips and pacs photometry , play an important role here .",
    "* we provided meaningful results to the model - defined compactness parameter @xmath46 , introduced by @xcite , and linked them to the proximity of ionizing sources and hot dust .",
    "* we have shown that modelling the sed of a typical starburst region requires a component of heavily embedded objects ( massive ysos and uchiirs ) which dominate the mid - infrared continuum slope .",
    "the derived mass fraction of this embedded component can be interpreted as an upper limit to the amount of current star formation , since there are other dust heating mechanisms not included in the models .",
    "* we found a degeneracy between the total stellar mass and the relative amount of pdr material , @xmath47 , as both will contribute to the dust continuum .",
    "this degeneracy may lead to uncertain mass estimates and can only be resolved with additional data at longer wavelengths , e.g. from herschel . * generally , two critical assumptions in all starburst models are the age and duration of the burst .",
    "our `` local '' template 30 doradus nicely illustrates the typical complexity of a starburst with both , the presence of a luminous , coeval cluster ( r136 ) , and strong evidence for continuous star formation across the region .",
    "hence , we have also used an age - average model of continuous star formation for comparison .",
    "this model delivers values for compactness and pdr contribution that are consistent with those derived from the single age models . for 30 doradus",
    "we derive a contribution of approximately 10% to the total sfr of the lmc .    now with a robust and well - tested modelling and fitting routine in hand , we plan to apply this approach to more distant giant hii  regions and starburst galaxies .",
    "the lack of spatially resolved data on e.g. , more distant ulirgs and sub - millimeter galaxies requires reliable and well calibrated models to derive the physical conditions in these starbursts . the novel fitting procedure presented in this paper",
    "constitute the next step in starburst modelling and puts such studies on solid grounds ."
