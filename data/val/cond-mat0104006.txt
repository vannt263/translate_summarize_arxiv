    "the quantized conductance @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , through a narrow quantum point contact was discovered in 1988 @xcite .",
    "this quantization can be understood within a one - dimensional ( 1d ) non - interacting electron gas picture , see e.g. ref.@xcite . in the present work we are interested in a deviation from the integer quantization .",
    "this deviation , the so called `` 0.7 anomaly '' has been found in experimental works @xcite . the anomaly is a shoulder - like feature or a narrow plateau at @xmath4 .",
    "the recent work @xcite demonstrates that the anomaly evolves down to @xmath5 in longer quantum contacts .",
    "another highly interesting recent experimental development is an indication of the above barrier excitation @xcite .",
    "the excitation is probably related to the `` 0.7 anomaly '' .",
    "there is practically no doubt that the structure is due to the interaction between the electrons .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to explain the `` 0.7 anomaly '' by spontaneous magnetization of the 1d quantum wire due to exchange coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "a somewhat similar , but still different idea is to explain the anomaly by formation of a two - electron bound state with total spin @xmath6 , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is not clear why the spontaneous magnetization scenario can be valid since it contradicts to the rigorous lieb - mattis theorem @xcite .",
    "the theorem claims that any 1d many - body system with quadratic kinetic energy and with a potential interaction has the ground state with zero spin .",
    "the same argument is applicable to the s=1 bound state picture . strictly speaking",
    "in the later case one can avoid a formal contradiction with the theorem saying that the bound state is localized somewhere in the transition region between the 2d or 3d conductor and the 1d wire .",
    "however this scenario seems unlikely and in the present work i consider only s=0 ground state in accordance with lieb - mattis theorem .    the effect of wigner crystallization in low density 2d and 3d electron gas is well known .",
    "there is no such a thing as an ideal 1d wigner crystal because quantum fluctuations destroy any long range order .",
    "however it was pointed out some time ago @xcite that impurities suppress the fluctuations and pin the 1d wigner crystal .",
    "surprisingly this happens at pretty high density of electrons @xmath7 : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bohr radius .",
    "a quantum contact ( = short quantum wire ) is not uniform and hence it pins the crystal .",
    "this must result in nontrivial behavior of the contact conductance .",
    "it is the effect we study in the present work using the hartree - fock ( hf ) method .",
    "we demonstrate that the effect results in the conductance anomaly at @xmath10 for a short contact and in several anomalies for longer contacts . in the present work we consider only zero temperature case .",
    "however in conclusions we comment on temperature dependence .",
    "the idea of relation between the conductance anomaly and the wigner crystallization was also suggested in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "authors of this paper discuss a ferromagnetic state embedded in the wigner crystal .",
    "we follow the different way considering the ground state with total spin zero in accordance with lieb - mattis theorem .    in independent particle approximation , i.e. in the case of an ideal electron gas , a calculation of the conductance for a given transverse channel is straightforward . assuming adiabatic transmission one gets @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the barrier transmission probability at fermi energy @xcite . in the case of interacting particles",
    "this formula is also valid because before and after the potential barrier the density of electrons is high enough , and hence the interaction is negligible .",
    "however one can not use the single particle description to calculate the transmission probability @xmath12 because in the vicinity of the barrier the electron density is low , and hence the many - body effects are very important .",
    "the main question is how to calculate the transmission probability @xmath12 ? to do this",
    "we apply the following trick .",
    "consider the liquid of electrons on a 1d ring with a potential barrier somewhere on the ring .",
    "there is no a current in the ground state of the system .",
    "now let us apply a magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "this flux induces the electric current . on the one hand",
    "the current is related to the barrier transmission probability @xmath12 . on the other hand",
    ", the current can be calculated using the hf method .",
    "this allows us to find @xmath12 with account of many - body effects .",
    "structure of the present paper is the following : the relation between the current on the ring and the transmission probability is derived in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii we demonstrate how the hartree - fock method describes development of the charge - density wave at low electron density .",
    "the results of selfconsistent calculations of the transmission probabilities for different barriers are presented in sec .",
    "v summarizes the results and presents our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a single particle in a potential @xmath13 .",
    "the potential is localized near @xmath14 , @xmath15 at @xmath16 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the potential is symmetric , @xmath17 . in the scattering problem",
    "the wave function outside the region of the potential is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the momentum of the particle , @xmath20 is the reflection amplitude and @xmath21 is the transmission amplitude . throughout the paper we set the electron mass , electric charge , and the planck constant equal to unity , @xmath22 .",
    "the transmission probability is @xmath23 .",
    "one can also use the basis of standing waves .",
    "since the potential is symmetric , there is one symmetric and one antisymmetric solution at a given energy @xmath24 @xmath25 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ psi1 ] ) and ( [ psi2 ] ) one can express the transmission and reflection amplitudes in terms of the scattering phases @xmath26 where @xmath27    now we switch the vector potential @xmath28 on @xmath29 and close the ring imposing the periodic boundary condition @xmath30 we will assume that the length of the ring @xmath31 is much larger than the size of the region where the potential @xmath13 is nonzero : @xmath32 .",
    "note that the vector potential we introduce is the pure gauge one .",
    "we need it to induce the orbital current in the ring .",
    "the magnetic field is zero .",
    "the induced current depends only on the bohm - aharonov phase @xmath33 . in the many - body problem",
    "the current has period @xmath34 .",
    "the current is maximum at @xmath35 . for further considerations we take the first maximum @xmath36    solution of the schrdinger equation with hamiltonian ( [ h1]),([aa ] ) and the periodic boundary condition ( [ per ] ) gives the following single electron wave functions outside of the region of the potential . @xmath37 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the momentum @xmath40 obeys the following quantization condition @xmath41 there are two solutions : @xmath42 and @xmath43 . to elucidate meaning of these solutions",
    "let us look at two limiting cases .",
    "the first limit is an infinitely high potential barrier , @xmath44 . in this case",
    "the scattering phases are equal , @xmath45 . substituting these phases into eqs .",
    "( [ apm ] ) , ( [ psi3 ] ) one finds that the wave functions @xmath46 coincide with symmetric and antisymmetric standing waves ( [ psi2 ] ) . in the second limit",
    "there is no barrier , @xmath47",
    ". then the scattering phases are the following : @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "one can prove that in this case the states ( [ psi3 ] ) describe clockwise and anti - clockwise rotations , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the quantization condition ( [ quant ] ) gives the following momenta @xmath52 and energy levels @xmath53 using the wave functions ( [ psi3 ] ) one easily finds the electric current in each single particle state @xmath54    up to now we were considering the single particle problem .",
    "now let us consider the many body problem .",
    "to do this we fill all the single particle states up to the fermi energy .",
    "each orbital state is filled by two electrons , spin up and spin down .",

    "( [ jjj ] ) gives the main tool we use in the present work .",
    "first we solve numerically the many body problem on the ring without the barrier , @xmath47 , and find the electric current @xmath62 .",
    "second we solve numerically the many body problem with the barrier , @xmath63 , and find the electric current @xmath64 . then using eqs .",
    "( [ jjj ] ) and ( [ abt ] ) we conclude that the transmission probability at the fermi energy is @xmath65 this is exactly the transmission probability we need for the conductance ( [ gt ] ) .    in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ jjj ] ) and ( [ tt ] ) we neglect electron - electron interaction outside the potential barrier .",
    "this is valid if the density of electrons is high enough . in the vicinity of the barrier",
    "the electron density is low and hence the electron - electron interaction is very important .",
    "this does not contradict to the presented derivation .",
    "the information about the electron - electron interaction is hidden in the scattering phases .",
    "finally we would like to comment on the luttinger liquid behavior that is related to the long - range fluctuations in the 1d interacting fermi gas .",
    "the hf method we use to analyze the electron ring certainly does not take into account the long - range fluctuations .",
    "however this is irrelevant to the calculation of the barrier transmission probability .",
    "the matter is that the number of electrons above the quantum barrier is not more than several , so there is no room for the long - range fluctuations within the barrier .",
    "the long ring outside the barrier is just a technical trick to describe the reservoir of electrons .",
    "there is no need to take into account the long - range fluctuations in the reservoir .",
    "the hamiltonian of the many body system we consider is of the form @xmath66+{1\\over{2}}\\sum_{i , j } v(x_i , x_j),\\ ] ] where indexes @xmath67 and @xmath68 numerates electrons , @xmath69 is the periodic coordinate ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath28 is the gauge field ( [ aa ] ) , @xmath13 is the potential barrier , and @xmath71 is the electron - electron interaction .",
    "we use atomic units , so coordinates are measured in unites of bohr radius , @xmath72 , and energies are measured in units of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the effective electron mass and @xmath75 is the dielectric constant . for experimental conditions of works",
    "@xcite these values are the following : @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the electron - electron coulomb repulsion we take in the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the effective width of the transverse channel , and @xmath80 is the length of the shortest arc between the points @xmath81 and @xmath82 on the ring , see comment @xcite .",
    "the transverse motion of electrons is frozen due to some confining potential that can be approximated as @xmath83 according to the data @xcite the energy splitting between the transverse channels is @xmath84 .",
    "this gives the following value of the first channel transverse size @xmath85 averaging over the oscillator wave function of the transverse motion shows that the effective 1d coulomb interaction is well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ vij ] ) .",
    "we stress that the value of @xmath79 is close to the critical distance between the electrons at which the wigner crystallization occurs @xcite .",
    "this is a fortunate coincidence .",
    "larger value of @xmath79 would suppress the conductance anomaly , and this really happens in higher transverse channels .",
    "substantially smaller value of @xmath79 would require a theoretical technique more sophisticated than the hf method employed in the present work .",
    "we will discuss this point later .",
    "let us also comment on the long - range behavior of the interaction ( [ vij ] ) . because of the ring geometry the interaction ( [ vij ] ) at @xmath86 is somewhat different from the coulomb one .",
    "however the so long range tail of the interaction does not influence the results . anyway in a real system there is a screening by gates and many other effects that influence the long range tail .",
    "what is important is that at the size of the barrier @xmath87 the interaction ( [ vij ] ) has the right form , @xmath88 .    in",
    "the hf method the many body wave function of the system ( [ hmb ] ) is represented in the form of slater determinant of single particle orbitals @xmath89 .",
    "each orbital obeys the equation @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the single particle energy and @xmath92 is the hf hamiltonian @xmath93 here the summation is performed over all filled orbitals . to avoid misunderstanding we have to comment on a terminological question .",
    "usually only the case of zero vector potential , @xmath94 , is called the hf method . if @xmath95 the method is called the hartree - fock method in the external field , or if @xmath28 is time dependent it is called the time dependent hartree - fock method @xcite .",
    "the external field method is equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "a crucial point is that the external field hartree - fock method ( = rpa ) is gauge invariant , and therefore the electric current calculated within this method is conserved @xcite .    for computations we use a ring of length @xmath96 with a finite grid of 400 or 600 points .",
    "a naive finite grid version of the hamiltonian ( [ hhf ] ) has a weak dependence on the gauge and hence the electric current is not exactly conserved . to avoid this minor trouble we use the lattice ( = grid ) modification of the hamiltonian ( [ hhf ] ) replacing @xmath97 by @xmath98/2h^2 $ ] . here",

    ", we also show by dashed lines the results obtained in the hartree approximation ( no exchange interaction ) .",
    "the hartree approximation also gives the charge density wave but underestimates the effect .",
    "in real wigner crystal spins are localized at the sites of the lattice .",
    "this spin structure certainly can not be obtained in the hf approximation that enforces zero spin density at any point .",
    "however we are not going to study a real wigner crystal at very low electron density .",
    "anyway such a state does not conduct an electric current .",
    "we are interested in @xmath111 .",

    "( [ vij]),([at ] ) . at the smaller value of @xmath79",
