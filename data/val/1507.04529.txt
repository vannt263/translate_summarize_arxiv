    "the presence of long distribution tails in stochastic systems means a qualitatively different picture than a familiar gaussian process . in particular ,",

    "the stationary solutions in the asymptotic limit have been also found for strongly nonlinear systems , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and the steep slope of the potential modifies the distribution making the variance finite @xcite .",
    "this analysis was generalised to a two - dimensional problem @xcite and to systems driven by a multiplicative noise @xcite ; the spectral analysis was performed for transport in an inhomogeneous medium @xcite .",
    "the above approach is markovian ( eq.([la0 ] ) is local in time ) and does not take into account memory effects emerging in complex @xcite and disordered systems @xcite where , as a result of traps and faults , the particle experiences periods of long rests",
    ". then the process can be formalised by a jump - size and waiting - time distribution in the framework of the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "the problem without any potential is well known : the variance ",
    "existing for the gaussian case  rises slower than linearly , which means a subdiffusion , and the characteristic function of the density distribution decays according to the mittag - leffler pattern @xcite .",
    "the diffusive behaviour for which the variance rises with time slower or faster than linearly is often called an anomalous transport , in contrast to a normal diffusion .",
    "processes characterised by the anomalous transport  e.g. the flow in porous media where fractional space derivatives model large motions through highly conductive layers or fractures while fractional time derivatives describe motionless particles @xcite  can be conveniently handled by the subordination procedure @xcite . in that description ,",
    "the markovian dynamics proceeds in an operational time and is given by eq.([la0 ] ) ( a subordinated process ) , whereas the memory effects are modelled by another langevin equation for the physical time which is a non - decreasing random variable , determined by a one - sided density distribution @xmath13 ( a subordinator ) . in the presence of a potential ,",
    "the process ( [ la0 ] ) has a stationary limit and the subordinator determines a relaxation to that stationary state .",
    "long tails of the waiting - time distribution mean a deviation from the exponential debye relaxation .",
    "non - exponential forms of the relaxation are common in complex systems : viscoelastic materials , synthetic polymers and biopolymers @xcite .",
    "they emerge in supercooled liquids near the glass transition temperature and in amorphous polymers @xcite ; a typical decay form of the relaxation processes is a mittag - leffler function ( cole - cole ) @xcite .",
    "diversity of systems exhibiting the non - exponential relaxation traces back to the universality present in complex systems : the empirical relaxation laws reflect a behaviour which is independent of the details of examined systems @xcite . from that point of view",
    ", the non - exponential relaxation can be understood as a result of a strong interaction between diverse elementary units .    in a nonhomogeneous medium",
    ", one can expect that the waiting time depends on the position .",
    "the corresponding ctrw description is coupled @xcite ; its markovian version contains the waiting - time distribution in a poissonian form , characterised by a variable jumping rate @xcite , and resolves itself to a fokker - planck equation with a multiplicative noise @xcite . in the disordered systems ,",
    "many forms of the disorder may emerge @xcite and the dynamics becomes complicated if one assumes that the trap positions slowly evolve with time ( a quenched disorder ) , then the successive trapping times are correlated .",
    "the position - dependence of memory effects can be taken into account by applying a subordination technique and such a model has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "one can expect that a large density of traps or regular structures in the phase space the trajectories stick to invoke a long resting time at specific regions .",
    "the subordination approach @xcite takes into account that position - dependence by introducing a variable intensity of the random generator of the physical time , given by a non - negative function @xmath14 .",
    "then eq.([la0 ] ) describes the subordinated process and the dynamics is defined by the following set of equations , @xmath15 where the increments @xmath5 and @xmath16 obey the lvy stable statistics with the stability indexes @xmath2 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the process @xmath18 is non - decreasing and biased by the medium properties : if , in particular , @xmath14 is large , the particle stays at @xmath0 for a relatively long time , compared to the region where @xmath14 is small .",
    "eq.([la ] ) can be approximated by an ordinary subordination process if we decouple the random and the position - dependent ingredient ; this can be accomplished by a two - step procedure @xcite .",

    "since the first equation ( [ la ] ) can be discretized as @xmath22 , the system ( [ la ] ) , after inserting @xmath23 , resolves itself to the langevin equation with a multiplicative noise in the it interpretation which defines a markovian process .",
    "the above equation incorporates the spatial distribution of traps but neglects the memory effects which are important if @xmath24 .",
    "then , as a second step , we take into account those effects subordinating the markovian process to the random time determined by @xmath24 .",
    "the final set of equations reads , @xmath25 where @xmath26^{-1}$ ] ; we assume in the following @xmath27 .",
    "the process described by eq.([las ] ) was studied for @xmath28 @xcite : it corresponds to a markovian ctrw with a variable jumping rate , subordinated to a random time , and resolves itself to a fractional fokker - planck equation with a variable diffusion coefficient .",
    "the system ( [ las ] ) is used , for example , to describe such transport phenomena as advection , molecular diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion , where the first equation ( [ las ] ) is related to the advection - dispersion equation whereas the subordination accounts for memory @xcite .    in the presence of an external potential , eq.([la0 ] ) predicts a convergence to a stationary density distribution . however , the stationary state is difficult to derive and known in its exact form only for few potentials @xcite .",
    "all the more difficult is a problem of the relaxation to that state and the time - dependent solutions are unknown even for the markovian case .",
    "it is unclear , in particular , whether the mittag - leffler pattern is still valid when a process with a nonlinear deterministic force is subordinated to the random time . in the present paper ,",
    "we address that relaxation problem and consider a more general case of the position - dependent memory .",
    "we find expressions for the asymptotic stationary density for the potential in a power - law form and derive the density for the subordinated process , as a function of the operational time , for a quadratic potential ( sec.ii ) .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to the time - dependent solutions of eq.([la ] ) , ( [ las ] ) where the relaxation function is derived and the influence of the nonhomogeneity effects on the decay rate of the density is discussed .",
    "we consider a stochastic system under the influence of an non - linear deterministic force , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31const .",
    "this form of the stimulation is a natural generalisation of an ordinary harmonic oscillator and often discussed in connection with the chaotic dynamics @xcite .",

    "we restrict our considerations to the asymptotic regime in positions , which corresponds to small wave numbers , and derive a stationary solution . due to the factor @xmath36 in the last term of eq.([fracek ] ) , the leading term in the solution is of the order @xmath36 implying the asymptotic solution in a scaling form , @xmath37 where @xmath38const ; the above solution is valid if @xmath39 .",

    "stochastic properties of the systems for which particle is subjected to the gaussian white noise and remains under the influence of an external deterministic force are usually described by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the expansion of its solution to the eigenfunctions of the fokker - planck operator contains single modes which decay exponentially in time to a stationary state representing a gibbs - boltzmann distribution and the temperature is related to the diffusion coefficient by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "generalisation of that equation takes into account the memory effects by introducing a fractional derivative over time ( the fractional fokker - planck equation ) . in this generalised description ,",
    "a different relaxation pattern of the single modes emerges : the decay is governed by the mittag - leffler function @xcite and , in the case of the harmonically bound particle , also the variance decays according to that pattern @xcite .",
    "the mittag - leffler relaxation naturally emerges in the subordination technique @xcite .",

    "this time is defined by a one - sided , maximally asymmetric stable lvy distribution @xmath95 , where @xmath17 , which vanishes for @xmath96 .",
    "since the processes @xmath97 and @xmath98 are statistically independent , the distribution as a function of the physical time is given by the total probability formula , @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes an inverse subordinator @xcite .",
    "in the next subsection , we derive that distribution for the linear case .",
    "note that stationary state is completely determined by the distribution @xmath77 , i.e. by the noise type and the potential , whereas the subordinator , as a source of the subdiffusion , influences only the relaxation to that state .",

    "we need the distribution for the subordinated process , @xmath77 , i.e. the solution of eq.([frace ] ) . this distribution can not be found analytically , even for @xmath76 , if @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , we must resort to a numerical analysis details of which are presented in appendix b.     and calculated for @xmath121 and @xmath128 from eq.([las1 ] ) .",
    "the curves in the upper part correspond to @xmath1290.05 , 0.3 , 1 , 5 and 20 ( from bottom to top ) .",
    "the straight red lines mark the dependence @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "averaging was performed over @xmath132 trajectories.,width=302 ]    first , we consider eq.([las1 ] ) to get a qualitative picture of the solutions for various values of @xmath133 .",
    "just a simple analysis of eq.([las1 ] ) indicates that the cases @xmath134 and @xmath135 must be different . the particle , initially positioned at @xmath136 , is subjected only to the random force at the beginning of the time - evolution since the first term in eq.([las1 ] ) can be neglected for @xmath137 .",
    "hence the density distribution corresponds to the case without any potential and @xmath138 .",
    "however , the density approaches the stationary limit , which is of the form @xmath139 , differently for both cases : the tail becomes steeper ( @xmath134 ) or flatter ( @xmath135 ) during the evolution .",
    "the density distributions for those cases are presented , as a function of time , in fig.2 ; we assume , from now on , @xmath123 .",
    "if @xmath133 is large , the asymptotic distribution , @xmath139 , is visible already at a very short time but restricted to a large distance .",
    "the stationary distribution is reached at @xmath140 and the curves for the intermediate cases show a widening of the stationary tail .",
    "in contrast to this picture , the case @xmath141 exhibits a gradual change of the slope for the entire tail and the stationary distribution is reached at @xmath142 .    , @xmath122 , @xmath143 and three values of @xmath75 .",
    "the solid lines on the right side mark an exponential , @xmath144 , with @xmath145 , 0.4 and 0.14 ( from left to right ) . the solid line on the left side , fitted to the data for @xmath128 , marks a function @xmath146 .",
    "stars correspond to the case @xmath147 and @xmath128 .",
    "averaging was performed over @xmath148 trajectories.,width=302 ]    we consider both cases separately and assume , for the large @xmath133 , the finite variance : @xmath149 .",
    "then @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a function describing a time - dependence of the asymptotic density which converges to its stationary value @xmath152 ; on the other hand , we have @xmath153 for the initial condition in the form of the delta function .",
    "the relaxation function @xmath154 will serve as an estimator of the convergence rate to the stationary state .",
    "it is shown in fig.3 for a few values of @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast to the linear case , the relaxation is not smooth : it exhibits two regions of a very different slope . at a short time",
    ", @xmath117 diminishes relatively slowly whereas at large @xmath119 it rapidly falls according to the exponential rate .",
    "this picture emerges for both positive and negative @xmath75 but the break down of the curve is especially pronounced for @xmath155 .",
    "the case @xmath76 also indicates the exponential fall but the difference between the behaviour for small and large @xmath119 is less striking .",
    "the decline at small @xmath119 and for @xmath156 obeys , approximately , a power - law dependence ; the slope is more gentle than for the linear case .",
    "we conclude that instead of the power - law pattern , present for the linear case , the exponential relaxation is observed at long times .",
    "the curves in fig.3 correspond to different effective potentials in eq.([las ] ) and one can ask whether this is a reason of their different shapes . to check that , we performed a calculation for @xmath147 and @xmath128 which corresponds to the same effective potential as the case @xmath143 and @xmath76 .",
    "results , presented in fig.3 , indicate a clear disagreement of those cases and the relaxation pattern is determined by @xmath75 : the curves for the parameter sets @xmath147 , @xmath128 and @xmath143 , @xmath128 actually coincide .     calculated from eq.([las1 ] ) for @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath141 and @xmath128 ( upper part ) . the lower part presents the slope as a function of the physical time , calculated from eq.([inten ] ) .",
    "lines mark the functions @xmath157 and @xmath158 for the upper and lower part , respectively .",
    "each point was obtained from the density evaluated by averaging over @xmath132 trajectories.,width=302 ]    estimation of the decay rate to the stationary state in terms of the function @xmath117 , eq.([chinl ] ) , is not possible for @xmath135 ( @xmath159 ) since then the variance is infinite .",
    "instead , we consider the time - evolution of the slope of the asymptotic distribution , @xmath160 .",
    "evaluation of the tails is numerically difficult  in respect to the precision and the calculation time  if one directly solves eq.([la ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the distributions in the operational time for the process defined by eq.([las ] ) are easier to handle and the tails can be precisely determined .",
    "therefore , we calculated @xmath160 from eq.([las ] ) .",
    "as the first step , the slope @xmath161 and the relative intensity of @xmath77 , @xmath162 , were evaluated from eq.([las1 ] ) ; the densities are presented in the upper part of fig.2 . knowing those quantities , the final asymptotic distribution @xmath102 can be obtained by a direct integration by means of eq.([inte ] ) , @xmath163 and we restrict our analysis to the case @xmath164 for which the inverse subordinator has a simple form , @xmath165 slopes of the asymptotic distributions characterising both processes are presented in fig.4",
    "they have different shapes as functions of time : @xmath161 is almost constant at small times and declines as a power - law reaching its stationary value at @xmath166 .",
    "the integration ( [ inten ] ) brings about a smoothing effect : @xmath160 has a power - law shape for all times and the index @xmath167 is smaller than for the subordinated process at a corresponding time ; the stationary state is reached at @xmath168 .",
    "we have considered a dynamical process defined by the stochastic stimulation  governed by the lvy stable statistics  and the external potential in the form of both harmonic and strongly non - linear oscillator .",
    "it has been assumed that the particle may be trapped for a long time and the trapping time varies with the position , as a result of a nonhomogeneous medium structure .",
    "the problem is formulated in terms of the subordination technique where the intensity of the random time in the subordinator is position - dependent .",
    "the asymptotics of the stationary state has been derived for the case of the non - linear deterministic force .",
    "it has a power - law form ; the slope depends on both the stability index of the driving noise and the potential but is independent of the memory characteristics : @xmath169 and @xmath75 .",
    "the relaxation process to that stationary state has been analysed for both harmonic and non - linear case . for the linear case ( the effective potential is quadratic ) , the decay rate @xmath170",
    "is observed at long times but the value of the relaxation function @xmath171 strongly varies as a function of @xmath75 ; long trapping times near the origin ( @xmath79 ) correspond to a long time of approaching the stationary state .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath76 , where relaxation obey the mittag - leffler pattern , @xmath117 for the general case involves a linear combination of the mittag - leffler functions .",
    "the density distribution for the linear case satisfies the integro - differential equation with a complicated kernel that resolves itself to a fractional equation with a variable diffusion coefficient in a limit of long time .",
    "the density distributions for a nonlinear effective force exhibit a complicated and differentiated structure which qualitatively depends on the potential slope .",
    "the strong potentials mean a rapid development of the stationary slope whereas the weak potentials are characterised by a gradual flattening of the entire tail . in the former case , the relaxation function is always exponential for long times : the mittag - leffler pattern breaks down and the debye relaxation is observed . at smaller times , the decay is slow and weakly depends on @xmath75 .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that the relaxation pattern is sensitive rather on the spacial nonhomogeneity of the memory , parametrised by @xmath75 , than on a slope of the effective deterministic force .",
    "the results indicate that the relaxation for a complex system  in which long tails of the random force distribution coexist with a position - dependent trap distribution  to a stationary state depends on both an external potential and a structure of the trap positions .",
    "when the non - exponential pattern is observed , as it is the case for the linear systems , the latter characteristics may strongly influence the relaxation time .",
    "however , the linearity property refers not to the external potential alone but results from an interplay between this potential and the trap distribution .",
    "therefore , though the nonlinearity changes the relaxation pattern to the exponential , presence of the mittag - leffler pattern in the experimental data does not necessarily imply that the linear deterministic force would be correct in a dynamical description of the case of the uniform trap distribution .",
    "finally , we emphasise the non - homogeneous trap distribution can make the variance of the process value finite .",
    "the divergent variance for the lvy flights is often unphysical and we demonstrated that this difficulty may not emerge even for relatively weak potentials if @xmath75 is negative and sufficiently small .",
