    "one of the simplest models , which is used for a description of strongly correlated electron systems ( in particular , transition metal compounds , polymers , fullerenes c@xmath1 , high - temperature superconductors , heavy fermion substances ) is the hubbard model  @xcite ( for reviews see papers  @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "hubbard first showed that taking into account the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion @xmath2 of two electrons essentially modifies the band energy spectrum and plays the main role in the formation of electrical and magnetic properties of the material with narrow energy bands .",
    "the ideas of `` lower '' and `` upper '' hubbard bands , introduced in this paper , proved to be useful both for our understanding of physics of correlation effects in narrow energy bands and for the interpretation of experimental data for narrow band materials , in particular high-@xmath3 superconductors .",
    "it should be noted that progress in experimental techniques , such as photoemission and x - ray absorption spectroscopy , has recently confirmed and enabled direct measurements of these theoretically predicted hubbard bands  @xcite-@xcite",
    ".    however , theoretical analyses , on the one hand , and available experimental data , which argue an electron - hole asymmetry , on the other hand , point out the necessity of the hubbard model generalization by taking into account correlated hopping ( electron - hole asymmetry is a peculiar property of the hubbard model ) .",
    "really , in some compounds ( e.g. see the estimation in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) the matrix elements of electron - electron interactions describing inter - site hoppings of electrons ( correlated hopping ) are of the same order that the hopping integral or on - site coulomb repulsion ; also , the results of the first principles calculations performed by hirsch  @xcite show that hopping integrals of electrons between neighbouring ions can depend strongly on the instantaneous charge occupation of the two atoms involved in the hopping process ( in contrast to the hubbard model where inter - site hoppings of electrons do not correlate by the occupation of these sites ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental observations show electron - hole asymmetry of properties of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "in particular , transition metal oxides exhibit the electron - hole asymmetry of conductivity  @xcite , transition @xmath4-metals have the electron - hole asymmetry of cohesive energy  @xcite . in this connexion , the experimentally observed  @xcite electron - hole asymmetry of superconducting properties of high - temperature superconductors should be also noted .",
    "consequently , in recent years the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping has been used widely to describe strongly correlated electron systems  @xcite-@xcite ; the electron - hole asymmetry is a property of such a generalized hubbard model as a result of the dependence of the hopping integral on the occupation of the sites involved in the hopping process .",
    "generalized hubbard model has been used for an investigation of metallic ferromagnetism in narrow energy bands  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , a generalization of nagaoka s theorem has been proved in paper  @xcite , and it has been shown  @xcite that in strong coupling regime the model strongly favours ferromagnetism for electron concentration @xmath5 versus electron concentration @xmath6 , as observed in transition metal compounds .",
    "electrical properties , metal - insulator transition and high - temperature superconductivity have been studied in the generalized hubbard model in papers  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the result of these papers is the generalized hubbard model has much better physics than the hubbard model , firstly , and usage of the electron - hole asymmetry concept allows one to interpret the peculiarities of physical properties of strongly correlated electron systems , which are not explained by the hubbard model , secondly .",
    "in particular , the experimentally observed electron - hole asymmetries of metal oxides conductivity , of cohesive energy of transition @xmath4-metals and of superconducting properties of high - temperature superconductors , mentioned above , have been explained within the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping in papers  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite respectively",
    ".    an important puzzle remaining beyond consideration in the cited papers is the question about location of the model chemical potential and its dependence on electron concentration and temperature .",
    "theoretical calculations of chemical potential dependences can be compared with the experimental data obtained by photoemission spectroscopy methods .",
    "also these dependences of chemical potential could give indication for the existence of phase separation in system upon doping .",
    "even in the framework of the hubbard model this problem is still open , in particular the question about the jump in chemical potential of the hubbard model at half - filling in going from electron to hole doping is under discussion in recent literature ( see , for instance , review  @xcite ) . on the one hand , in majority of papers it has been found that the jump in chemical potential at half - filling is equal to width of the energy gap . on the other hand , some authors suggest that the discontinuity in chemical potential is strictly smaller than the energy gap as a result of inducing states inside the mott - hubbard gap ( so called `` midgap states '' ) upon doping the mott insulators .",
    "the first scenario is confirmed by the exact solution  @xcite of the hubbard model in one dimension .",
    "also numerical studies of the two - dimensional hubbard model performed in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of the monte carlo methods show that when the electron concentration @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is infinitesimal doping ) , the chemical potential is located at the top of the lower hubbard band ; when the electron concentration @xmath9 , the chemical potential jumps to the bottom of the upper hubbard band .",
    "correspondingly , upon electron doping the chemical potential jumps from the top of the lower hubbard band to the bottom of the upper hubbard band according to the first scenario .",
    "the results of papers  @xcite obtained by means of the kotliar - ruckenstein slave bosons  @xcite for the three dimensional hubbard model and the quantum monte carlo method in infinite dimensions  @xcite suggest that the jump in chemical potential at half - filling is equal to width of the energy gap .    using the projective self - consistent technique  @xcite in infinite dimensions",
    ", the authors of papers  @xcite found that , for any value of @xmath2 larger than @xmath10 , doping does induce states inside the mott - hubbard gap ; the splitting of these states from the edge of the hubbard band is a fraction of the bare kinetic energy , and remains finite even in the limit where @xmath2 is infinite .",
    "therefore the jump in chemical potential for infinitesimal doping is strictly less than the energy gap , so the second scenario described above holds .",
    "these conclusions were also supported by an extention  @xcite of the iterated perturbative theory approximation  @xcite for the hubbard model away from half - filling .",
    "midgap states have also been predicted  @xcite to occur upon doping in the infinite dimensional hubbard model using an analytic variant of the lanczos continued fraction method  @xcite .    in consequence of the absence of a rigorous result on the described scenarios adequacy",
    "the subject is still open .",
    "moreover , even in infinite dimensions this problem is under discussion : different approximations , for example the quantum monte carlo method and the iterated perturbative theory , lead to the contrary results .",
    "another question is how correlated hopping does influence on chemical potential .",
    "therefore , the investigation of chemical potential behaviour in the doped hubbard model as well as in the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping is a relevant and important task , which the present paper is devoted .    the paper has the following structure . in section",
    "2 we formulate hamiltonian of the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping , the quasiparticle energy spectrum of the model is derived by means of a generalized mean - field approximation ( an analogue of the projection operation ) in the green function technique .",
    "the general properties of the spectrum , and the approximation used by us are discussed . in sections  3 - 4",
    "the dependences of chemical potential on the model energy parameters , correlated hopping , temperature and electron concentration are studied .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the experimental data on fermi energy behaviour of real strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "finally , section  5 is devoted to the conclusions from the obtained results .",
    "we start from the natural generalization of the hubbard model including the matrix elements of electron - electron interaction  @xcite @xmath11 which correlate the electron hopping from one lattice site to another ( @xmath12 is the wannier function ) .",

    "@xmath30 describes the atomic limit of narrow - band models .",
    "@xmath31 describes the translational hopping of holes and doublons ; within the present model the hopping integrals of holes @xmath32 and doublons @xmath33 are different ( in contrast with narrow - band models of the hubbard type ) , this leads to the electron - hole asymmetry mentioned above . @xmath34",

    "in such a case the methods of mean - field type are useful  @xcite , we have used one of these methods .",

    "the criterion of metal - insulator transition obtained by means of this approximation is @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) in agreement with the mott s criterion  @xcite and the result of the random dispersion approximation  @xcite in infinite dimensions . in the limit of strong interactions",
    "the approach satisfies another requirement of a good approximate theory for the hubbard model at half - filling formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath75 ( @xmath76 are the widths of the lower and upper hubbard bands ) .",
    "for the special case @xmath38 of the model  ( [ ham ] ) the generalized mean - field approximation reproduces exact criterion  ( [ exact_cr ] ) of metal - insulator transition , the ground state energy and doublon concentration .",
    "for very small ( large ) values of electron concentration and @xmath57 the approximation gives the band description according to the general physical ideas .",
    "the approach allows  @xcite also to describe the observed transition in some mott - hubbard compounds from a metallic state to an insulating phase with the increase of temperature in a paramagnetic state ( see , for example , book  @xcite , p.  178 , 195 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "a deficiency of the generalized mean - field approximation is the breakdown of fermi liquid behaviour of the systems with weak interactions and half - filled band ( however , it should be noted that in the present paper we consider the cases of strong and intermediate interactions ) .",
    "the question about fermi liquid behaviour ( i.e. the fulfilment of luttinger s theorem  @xcite ) at intermediate to strong interactions in three dimensions is under discussion  @xcite .",
    "this is caused by the reason that luttinger s theorem is based  @xcite on the perturbation expansion , assuming an adiabatic relation between a noninteracting system and an interacting one , which may not be fulfiled for the case of intermediate and strong interactions .",
    "in particular , the authors  @xcite have found the violation of luttinger s theorem in the doped hubbard model , and @xmath77-@xmath78 model which is a partial case of the former one .",
    "therefore , although the system is metallic away from half - filling , it may be non - fermi liquid at intermediate and strong interactions because of a violation of luttinger s theorem .",
    "another limitation of the generalized mean - field theory is that for small values @xmath79 the approximaton does not reproduce the physics of the interaction of local magnetic moments as this holds in the framework of the effective hamiltonian method .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the paramagnetic phase , and in this case the effective inter - atomic exchange interaction ( kinematic superexchange ) leads to the renormalization of chemical potential only ( in the molecular field approximation ) .",
    "thus , apparently , it can be assumed that the generalized mean - field approximation used by us can provide a good description of effects of electron correlations in the paramagnetic phase and the region of intermediate ( when a metal - insulator transition can occur ) and strong interactions .",
    "note also , that a modification  @xcite of this approximation proposed one of us allows to take into account effects caused by the effective interaction of local magnetic moments ; at the same time , the main features of quasiparticle energy spectrum  ( [ es ] ) still persist .",
    "the noted generalized mean - field approximation has been applied also for study of metal - insulator transition and properties of generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping  @xcite , for description of metal - insulator transition in the doubly degenerate hubbard model  @xcite and a doubly orbitally degenerate model with correlated hopping  @xcite .",

    "moreover , with the decrease of temperature chemical potential rapidly increases , this dependence is different for the different values of correlated hopping parameters @xmath105 .",
    "the found temperature dependence of chemical potential can be explained by the following reasons . at zero temperature in an insulating phase the chemical potential",

    "thus , the value @xmath126 of electron concentration must exist satisfying the requirements : at this value the chemical potentials of the hubbard and generalized hubbard models are equal ( in this case the chemical potential is located at the centre of the upper hubbard band , i.e. @xmath127 ) , for electron concentration @xmath128 increasing correlated hoppings @xmath123 leads to the increase of chemical potential , and for @xmath129 chemical potential decreases with increasing correlated hoppings @xmath123 .",
    "similarly , we can explain the dependence of chemical potential of the generalized hubbard model on the correlated hopping @xmath36 for electron concentration @xmath6 .",

    "the fermi energy lies below the centre of the lower hubbard band , thus with the increase of temperature electrons become to occupy the above - lied empty energy levels , this leads to decreasing chemical potential ( an analogue of the case of free electrons ) . for the electron concentration @xmath144",
    "the fermi energy is located at the centre of the lower hubbard band , as the temperature increases the above - lied empty energy levels within the lower hubbard band become to be occupied , but the chemical potential does not change its value as a result of symmetry about the centre of the band . for enough high temperatures and values of the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion @xmath145",
    "some electrons are thermally activated into the upper hubbard band , therefore the chemical potential value decreases with increasing temperature at @xmath144 . for values of electron concentration @xmath129",
    "the number of empty energy levels within the lower hubbard band is small because the fermi energy in this case lies above the centre of the lower band , consequently with the increase of temperature chemical potential increases owing to occupancy of these levels and a presence of the empty upper hubbard band .",
    "similarly , the influence of temperature and electron concentration on chemical potential of the hubbard model for the values of electron concentration @xmath5 can be explained .",
    "note that one can see an analogy of the temperature dependence of chemical potential of the model under consideration with the same dependence in doped semiconductors .",
    "really , for electron concentration @xmath128 within the model the system has @xmath116-type of conductivity  @xcite and chemical potential decreases with increasing temperature as in @xmath116-type semiconductors . for electron concentration @xmath129 the system has @xmath146-type of conductivity , correspondingly chemical potential increases with the increase of temperature , as it is characteristically for @xmath146-type semiconductors .",
    "in the present paper chemical potential of the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping has been studied by means of a generalized mean - field approximation .",
    "the peculiarity of the model in comparison with similar generalized hubbard models is the concentration dependence of hopping integrals caused by taking into consideration the matrix elements of electron - electron interaction which describe inter - site hopping of electrons ( correlated hopping ) .",
    "the chemical potential as a function of the model energy parameters ( @xmath147 ) , electron concentration and temperature has been found . at half - filling , in contrast with the hubbard model where @xmath96 ,",
    "the dependences of chemical potential on energy parameters of the model are different in metallic and insulating phases leading to a kink at the point of metal - insulator transition at zero temperature ; with the increase of temperature the kink in the chemical potential curve disappears . with the increase of the correlated hopping @xmath35 ( i.e. with decreasing @xmath103 ) chemical potential moves towards the upper hubbard band .",
    "chemical potential of the generalized hubbard model with correlated hoping is temperature - dependent even in the case of half - filled band ( in contrast to the hubbard model ) . with",
    "the decrease of temperature chemical potential rapidly increases , this dependence is different for the different values of correlated hopping parameters @xmath105 . in high temperature region",
    "chemical potential of the asymmetric hubbard model tends to @xmath106 as temperature increases .    in strong coupling regime",
    "we have found that correlated hopping changes essentially the location of chemical potential of the generalized hubbard model : for the electron concentration @xmath128 increasing correlated hopping parameters leads to the increase of chemical potential , and for the case @xmath129 chemical potential decreases with increasing correlated hopping parameters .",
    "similarly , for the electron concentration @xmath128 chemical potential decreases with the increase of temperature , and for @xmath129 the increase of temperature leads to the increase of chemical potential ; at the value of electron concentration @xmath144 the chemical potential does not depend on correlated hopping and temperature .",
    "the found values @xmath130 correspond to the electron concentration when conductivity type of the system changes ; chemical potential of the systems with these electron concentrations is located at the centre of the lower and upper hubbard band respectively .    at zero temperature",
    "we have found the jump in chemical potential at half - filling in going from electron to hole doping , this discontinuity in chemical potential is strictly equal to the energy gap width @xmath120 .",
    "if the temperature is greater than zero then the discontinuous jump of chemical potential becomes more smooth , the dependence of chemical potential on electron concentration becomes a s - shaped curve with flex point at the electron concentration @xmath80 .",
