    "recent research has focused on protection or restoration of a quantum state subject to the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic noises @xcite .",

    "several theoretical schemes have been proposed to control decoherence , ranging from dynamic decoupling control @xcite and feedback control @xcite , to weak measurement @xcite and error correction codes @xcite , etc .",
    "while the dynamic decoupling and weak measurement are implemented to protect the quantum states by active external interventions , the error correction in quantum codes can be achieved through a passive realization of the encoded systems . however , in all realistic applications , the errors in quantum operations utilized in quantum information processing can not be completely eliminated .",
    "besides , the intricacy in manipulating coupled multiple - qubit systems has posed a serious challenge in scalable realizations in various quantum information carriers .",
    "all these fundamental issues of decoherence and control are still active research subjects .    quantum decoherence can be modeled as a non - unitary process , and the non - unitary dynamics of a quantum open system can be described by a master equation . clearly , a state evolving unitarily in an ideally _ closed _ system can be recovered by one unitary reversal operation .",

    "we investigate the feasibility of performing environment - assisted error correction for dephasing chanel .",

    "although the measurement basis states for ru decomposition can be easily numerically determined by the procedure above , the physical meaning is still unclear since they are superpositions of fock states , and more importantly , it may be difficult to perform such measurements .    in the common bath case",
    ", the fock basis does not admit an ru decomposition . to overcome this",
    ", we have two options .",
    "the first option is to construct an ru decomposition with kraus operators @xmath94 , which will shift the difficulty to finding the measurement operators .",
    "unfortunately , such measurement operators are difficult to realize . however",
    ", if we can overcome this by cleverly designing an experimental measurement procedure , then the advantage of this first choice is that the restoration scheme is applicable to arbitrary initial states .    on the other hand ,",
    "the second option is that we can make a compromise about what we choose for the initial states .",
    "if we are only interested in recovering some particular unknown entangled states ( and in most quantum information processing schemes , the initial states are usually the entangled states we discussed ) , then we can go beyond the ru decomposition scheme .",
    "the non - ru decomposition may give us a much simpler way of recovering entangled states , and simplify the implementation of the measurements .",
    "based on our current knowledge of experimental techniques , we show the whole scheme of the second option , and theoretically prove the feasibility of the first option .",

    "therefore , to gain some insight , we will explicitly construct the ru decomposition of the three - qubit case as a special example .",

    "thus , the number of independent equations in ( [ eq:34 ] ) is just the number of the upper triangular elements in @xmath128 plus one , i.e. , @xmath144 since @xmath128 is @xmath145 .",

    "@xcite , where for a more complex environment it is not clear how to find the environment measurement basis that realizes their ru decomposition . then , our ru decomposition for the one - qubit system will be easily generalized to the @xmath0-qubit case .",

    "if a measurement of the photon ( excitation ) numbers in the environment is performed , then two possible outcomes , odd or even , will correspond to the ru - type kraus operators @xmath161 and @xmath169 , respectively .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose an explicit scheme to fully recover a multiple - qubit state subject to a phase damping noise . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the theoretical framework and the operational procedure to restore an unknown initial quantum state for an @xmath0-qubit model interacting with either individual baths or a common bath . </S>",
    "<S> we give an explicit construction of the _ random unitary _ ( ru ) kraus decomposition for an @xmath0-qubit model interacting with a common bath . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate how to use only one unitary reversal operation to restore an arbitrary state with phase damping noise . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the initial state can always be recovered with a success probability of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we found that non - ru decomposition can also be used to restore some particular entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> this may open a new path to restore a quantum state beyond the standard ru scheme . </S>"
