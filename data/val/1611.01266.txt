    "in the last two decades , specially after the launch of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ , our understanding about the accretion process around a black hole candidate ( bhc ) is significantly improved .",
    "they are only detectable when matter from a companion , be it from the roche lobe or from its winds accretes on them .",
    "radiations are emitted in this process allowing them to infer on the accretion process .",
    "it is even better , when the rate of accretion changes rapidly , since the object can then go through various spectral states in quick successions and the timing properties also give out information about the companion .",
    "normally , an outbursting bhc shows four different spectral states , namely , hard ( hs ) , hard - intermediate ( hims ) , soft - intermediate ( sims ) , and soft ( ss ) ( belloni et al . 2005 ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ; nandi et al .",
    "2012 ; debnath et al .",
    "low frequency quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in some of these states are also observed ( e.g. , remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "evolution of temporal and spectral properties of several bhcs have been studied by many workers during their outbursts ( e.g. , belloni et al . , 2005 ;",
    "mcclintock & remillard , 2006 ; nandi et al . , 2012 ) and it has been noted by several authors that different spectral states are related to different branches of hardness intensity diagram ( hid ; belloni et al . 2005 ; debnath et al .",
    "2008 ) or accretion rate ratio intensity diagram ( arrid ; jana et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "it is well known that in order to explain majority of the black hole spectra one needs two types of components : one is a multi - color blackbody component radiated by the standard keplerian disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) and the other is a power - law ( pl ) component , originated from a so - called",
    " compton cloud \" ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 , 1985 ) .",
    "there are several models which describe the nature and origin of this  compton cloud \" . these range from a magnetic corona ( galeev et al .",
    "1979 ) to a hot gas corona over the disk ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ; zdziarski et al . 2003 ) .",
    "chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ; hereafter ct95 ) , even before the launch of rxte , considered the well known component solution of transonic flows ( see , chakrabarti 1990 ; chakrabarti 1996 ) , namely , the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( cenbol ) to represent the  compton cloud \" in their two component advective flow ( tcaf ) solution . from the observational evidence it is now established that ,",
    "both the components are dynamic and the low angular momentum halo component ( which does not require viscosity to accrete ) is moving faster than the more viscous keplerian disk ( soria et al . 2001 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ; wu et al . 2002 ; cambier & smith 2013 ; tomsick et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the early stage of an outburst ,",
    "the gravitational energy is mostly stored in the advective component as thermal energy and as the day progresses , this energy is released gradually by inverse comptonization since the soft ( seed ) photon flux also rises . in the declining phase the process",
    "is reversed , though the time scale varies .",
    "thus the hot post - shock flow in hs becomes cooler progressively in hims , sims and ss . whether or not all the states would be visited will depend on the how long the supply of viscous accretion creating the keplerian disk lasts . in a transonic flow with low enough viscosity",
    ", the centrifugal pressure slows down the flow and a standing or oscillating shock would be formed depending on whether the rankine - hugoniot conditions are satisfied ( chakrabarti 1989 , 1996 ) or not .",
    "this centrifugal barrier region is puffed up and acts as the  compton cloud \" .",
    "recently , self - consistency and stability check ( giri & chakrabarti 2013 ; mondal & chakrabarti 2013 ) of the transonic solution have been made which support from both the hydrodynamic and radiative points of view that an advective flow will desegregate into a tcaf solution ( ct95 ) when viscous stress near the equatorial plane is very high .",
    "successful fits of data from several black hole candidates have been recently obtained and the general nature of the accretion flow dynamics has been understood ( debnath , chakrabarti & mondal 2014 ; mondal , debnath & chakrabarti 2014 ; debnath , mondal & chakrabarti 2015a ; debnath , molla , chakrabarti & mondal 2015b ; jana et al .",

    "physical flow parameters such as the two types of accretion rates ( disk and halo ) , shock location ( size of the compton cloud ) , shock strength and the mass of the black hole were obtained after the inclusion of tcaf solution ( ct95 , chakrabarti 1997 ) as an additive table model in heasarc s spectral analysis software package xspec .",
    "the black hole candidate h  1743 - 322 is very active as it displayed several x - ray outbursts since its first detection in 1977 august - september by the _",
    "ariel v _ all sky monitor ( kaluzeinski & holt 1997 ) and _ heao i _ satellite ( doxsey et al . 1977 ) . after its first detection , it went to the quiescent state and remained that way for a long time till 1984 .",
    "a couple of x - ray activities were reported by _",
    "exosat _ observations in 1984 ( raynolds 1999 ) and by ttm / comis instruments on board _ mir - kvant _ in 1996 ( emelyanov et al . , 2000 ) . during the scanning of the galactic center on march 21 , 2003 , _",

    "mass of this bhc has not been dynamically measured yet , although petri ( 2008 ) , with their high frequency qpo model estimated that its mass could be between 9@xmath5 and 13@xmath5 . from the correlation between spectral and timing properties of black holes , shaposhnikov and titarchuk ( 2009 ; hereafter st09 ) calculated mass of this black hole candidate to be @xmath6 @xmath5 using 2003 data of rxte pca by taking gx  339 - 4 as a reference source of known mass .",

    "it is well known that timing and spectral properties of a bh are tightly correlated .",
    "titarchuk & fiorito ( 2004 ) , introduces a useful tool to determine mass of stellar massive black hole as well as super massive black hole by the correlation between power - law ( pl ) photon indices and characteristic frequencies of the observed quasi - periodic oscillation .",
    "shaposhnikov & titarchuk ( 2007 ; hereafter st07 ) employed this idea to estimate the mass of cyg  x-1 and obtained the mass to be @xmath11 .",

    "furthermore , the error - bar obtained by st09 on estimated mass of h  1743 - 322 is also quite large .",
    "most importantly , since 2003 outburst of h  1743 - 322 is quite anomalously bright with other effects such as activities in radio , which means the jets could also contribute to x - rays , it was essential to apply this method to a more ` normal ' outburst event which occured more recently .",
    "this motivated us to estimate the mass once more using more recent outbursts .",
    "in , 2010 and 2011 , h  1743 - 322 exhibited two x - ray flaring activities ( yamaoka et al .",

    "both the outbursts were covered by _ rxte _ almost on a daily basis for around two months during the outbursts .",
    "study of gross aspects of the temporal and spectral properties during these two outbursts using _ rxte pca _ data with combined disk black body ( dbb ) and power law ( pl ) model has already been made by debnath et al .",

    "this would indicate that no free parameter other than those five ( mass , two accretion rates , shock location and shock compression ratio ) required by tcaf is necessary to explain the entire outburst .",
    "n would otherwise be expected to remain constant as it is an intrinsic property of the system from one outburst to another , though it could have an error - bar consistent with the error - bars of other parameters on which it depends , such as the mass , distance and the inclination angle",
    ". systematic deviation of n from a constant value could be due to several effects such as the precession in the disk occurs which changes the projected surface area of emission .",

    "( 2016 ) , constant tcaf model normalization method to estimate mass of the source by analyzing 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 .",
    "according to tcaf solution , model normalization ( n ) should not vary significantly on a daily basis of a particular bh binary system , since it depends on physical intrinsic parameters , such as , mass , distance , disk inclination angle etc .",
    "so , we applied this concept to estimate mass of the bhc h  1743 - 322 by combined spectral analysis of the source during its two successive outbursts 2010 and 2011 using rxte / pca data .",
    "we first fitted the spectra using current version of the tcaf solution by keeping all model parameters as free .",
    "interestingly , obtained model normalization values comes within a narrow range for both the outbursts across all the spectral states . during 2010 outburst",
    "n is found within @xmath98 , and for 2011 outburst , it is found in between @xmath99 . since , in tcaf solution , mass is an independent parameter , we obtained mass range of the source as @xmath100 for 2010 outburst and @xmath101 for 2011 outburst .",
    "we then refitted all the spectra using constant normalization value n=15.55 ( obtained by taking average of the free model normalization values of both outbursts ) and we obtained mass range of the source as @xmath102 to @xmath103 ( for 2010 outburst ) , and @xmath104 to @xmath105 ( for 2011 outburst ) .",
    "now , by combining the results of 2010 & 2011 outbursts , the mass of the black hole candidate source can be constrained within a range of @xmath104 to @xmath105 . to verify this estimated mass range of the source , we refit all spectra by freezing all the model parameters .",
    "mass of the bh was changed in @xmath55 range to observe variation of @xmath53 .",
    "we also restrict ourself @xmath106 for best fits .",
    "the parabolic variations of the @xmath53 ( as shown in fig . 7 & 8) for all spectra show minima in between @xmath107",
    "titarchuk & fiorito ( 2004 ) introduced a model to correlate between spectral fitted photon index ( @xmath108 ) and the observed qpo frequency ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "this method is used to estimate mass of a few bhcs ( st07 ) . in this model , the central source is surrounded by a ` compton cloud ' along with a transition layer between this compton cloud and keplerian disk . according to this model",
    "the change in qpo frequency explained as the magneto - acoustic resonance oscillation frequency of the bounded transition layer ( titarchuk & wood , 2002 ) and the photon index ( due to change in optical depth of the hot electrons ) of emitted spectrum is due to change in the size of compton cloud . in the tcaf paradigm",
    "( chakrabarti & titarchuk , 1995 ) this compton cloud is the post - shock region of the accretion disk and the oscillation occurs due to near equality of compton cooling time scale and the infall time scale ( msc96 ; cmd15 ) .",
    "the change in qpo frequency and the photon index is also demonstrated in tcaf solution ( chakrabarti et al .",
    "2008 ; nandi et al .",
    "2012 ; debnath et al .",
    "the empirical relation given in st07 by , @xmath110 \\eqno{(1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the saturation point of photon index , @xmath112 is the slope of qpo - pl index curve which scales the mass and @xmath113 is the transition / threshold frequency above which the saturation of @xmath108 happens .",
    "value of @xmath114 controls how fast the transition occurs . in order to find mass of an unknown source bh , this method requires another source of known mass bh with similar type of correlation curve as a reference.we consider the 2005 outburst data of gro  j1655 - 40 as the reference source for scaling of pl index - qpo frequency correlations to estimate bh mass in h 1743 - 322 , because photon indices for these two objects demonstrate the same saturation level ( see fig.9 ) .",
    "note , this is necessary condition for applicability of scaling technique ( see details in sec .",
    "7.3 of seifina et al .",
    "this outburst data was also used by st07 to calculate mass of cyg x-1 and use the same values of a , b , d and @xmath113 as used by st07 to fit the data of gro  j1655 - 40 . in order to study the correlation between qpo and pl - index we extract pl index using comptb model ( farinelli et al .",
    "2008 ) and we found that the value of pl index obtained from comptb model is slightly higher due to bulk motion comptonization effect which hardens the spectrum a little bit than the pl index obtained from dbb - pl model , this difference in pl index would cause the difference in the value of mass of central object . during the fitting we freeze d = @xmath115 as in st07 .",
    "we use 2005 outburst data of gro  j1655 - 40 and use the fitted values of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 as used in st07 paper .",
    "the best fitted curve is shown by solid blue ( online ) curve in fig .",
    "9 . the best fitted value for h  1743 - 322 is @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the best fitted curve is shown by solid red ( online ) line in fig .",
    "9 . in this figure monotonical growth and",
    "elongated part with index saturation ( constancy ) on the level of @xmath108 = 2.23 are well seen .",
    "the index revealed in h1743 - 322 based on 2010 and 2011 data is similar to those established in a number of other black hole candidates and has been considered to be an observational evidence for the presence of a black hole in this source ( see , st07 , st09 and references therein ) . applying st07 method for bh source h  1743 - 322 by taking gro  j1655 - 40 as a reference source of mass @xmath122 ( greene et al . 2001 ) we obtain mass of this bh source as , @xmath123 which is in the same ball park as in our result .",
    "in this paper we estimated the mass of the black hole candidate h  1743 - 332 by using two independent methods .",
    "first , we investigate the evolution of spectral properties of galactic transient black hole candidate h  1743 - 322 during its 2010 & 2011 outbursts keeping the normalization as a constant parameter .",
    "we extract mass of the central object independently from each observation as was done in molla et al .",
    "we use the tcaf solution after its inclusion as a local additive table model in hearsrc s spectral analysis software package xspec . depending on the extracted flow parameters and nature of qpos , similar to debnath et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we also observe four spectral states , such as , hard , hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate and soft during both the 2010 & 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 . in the process of fitting",
    ", we found that the model normalization remains within a narrowest possible range for acceptable fits .",
    "most importantly , we also found that the same average normalization obtained from the 2010 outburst fits the data of 2011 outburst equally well . in order to obtain a rough estimation of the variation of thermal ( dbb ) and non - thermal ( pl ) fluxes during the outbursts",
    ", we follow the procedure given in debnath et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and see that qpo is totally absent in soft states for both the outbursts as in 2003 outburst of h  1743 - 322 ( mcclintock et al . , 2009 ; st09 ) .",
    "it is to be noted that low frequency qpos are thought to be due to shock oscillation phenomenon in the tcaf paradigm .",
    "shocks oscillate when the cooling time scale roughly matches with the infall time scale ( msc96 ; cmd15 ) inside cenbol .",
    "oscillating shock intercepts oscillating number of soft photons and hard photons are emitted accordingly , causing qpos ( chakrabarti & manickam , 2000 ) .    in order to keep the normalization constant or nearly constant , for a better fit ,",
    "sometimes we require two gaussian curves whose peaks are found to be at around @xmath25  kev and @xmath24  kev ( see , dotted curves in figs .",
    "6b , 6d and short dashed curves in figs .",
    "6a , 6c ) .",
    "we interpret @xmath24  kev line as the iron - line emitted from the keplerian disk .",
    "however , the peak around @xmath25  kev line is clearly not the red - shifted component of the iron line , because it is much stronger than the @xmath24  kev line .",
    "moreover , it is only about one - fifth of the continuum photon flux .",
    "the only explanation of this component must be that it is the signature of reappearance of the inner keplerian disk as the soft - state is approached .",
    "indeed , it can be seen from the appendix tables i and ii that the normalization of this component is rising as one goes from the harder state to the softer state and is going down again in the declining phase . in any case , since the pressure and therefore shear is higher at the inner edge , the angular momentum transport is fastest ( chakrabarti & molteni , 1995 ) and the reappearance of the keplerian disk in softer states must commence from the inner disk .",
    "so our work possible points to this aspect very clearly .    spectral analysis of 2010 outburst of this source with tcaf model has been done by mondal et al .",
    "( 2014 ) assuming a fixed mass of the black hole ( @xmath124 ) and keeping the model normalization free . on the other hand , to determine the mass independently , we fitted all the spectra using all tcaf model parameters as free and for both outbursts , we observe a narrow variation of model normalization ( @xmath98 for 2010 outburst and @xmath99 for 2011 outburst ) .",
    "mass of the source is obtained in the range : @xmath100 ( for 2010 outburst ) and @xmath101 ( for 2011 outburst ) .",
    "we then refitted all the spectra using constant average normalization value of @xmath125 and obtained the mass from @xmath102 to @xmath103 ( for 2010 outburst ) , and @xmath104 to @xmath105 ( for 2011 outburst ) .",
    "we then computed variation of @xmath53 with mass in this general range of @xmath126 and found that @xmath53 is minimum in between @xmath127 . to compare",
    ", we also estimate the mass of the source using another independent method , i.e. , st07 photon index ( @xmath108 ) vs. qpo frequency correlation scaling ) by taking data of the both 2010 and 2011 outbursts of h  1743 - 322 .",
    "our estimated mass from this method is @xmath1 , which was obtained by using gro  j1655 - 40 as a reference source . combining both the tcaf and the st07 methods , we believe that the mass of h  1743 - 322 should be in the range of @xmath2 . we find that the tcaf result gives the mean mass to be slightly lower as compared to the mean mass from st09 .",
    "tcaf represents a comprehensive solution of equations governing the flow .",
    "it attempts to explain the spectral and timing properties simultaneously and extract physical parameters such as the accretion rates , size of the compton cloud and even the mass of the central object .",
    "each individual observation gives a new and independent mass estimate .",
    "this is in contrast with the method of st07 and st09 where a refereence source is also required .",
    "so far , the effects of the magnetic field and spin have not been included in tcaf .",
    "however , since shocks are located far away in harder states , effects of spin would not be significant on the mass obtained from harder states .",
    "nevertheless , we are incorporating these effects and the results would be published elsewhere .",
