    "the gravitational effects of quantum fields in black hole spacetimes has long been studied . since hawking s discovery that black holes radiate @xcite much interesting",
    "work has been done in this area .",
    "quantities of interest include the expectation value @xmath0 , which describe vacuum polarization effects , and @xmath1 , the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor of the field .",
    "this latter quantity may then be used in the einstein field equations : @xmath2 to determine the back - reaction of the field on the original spacetime .",
    "the effects of the back - reaction may also include the removal of singularities ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "this is the main motivation for the work presented here and the answer would have consequences to many fundamental questions including the information loss problem .",
    "hiscock et.al @xcite have done an extensive study of these effects on the schwarzschild interior and have found cases where curvature is initially slowed in the interior as well as cases where the curvature is initially strengthened ( such as the case of the massless conformally coupled scalar field ) .",
    "they have also studied the effects on black hole anisotropy .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether or not the results are a product of the symmetry chosen or are general .",
    "it is also interesting to ask whether the presence of a cosmological constant will alter the situation .",
    "the study here attempts to address both issues by studying a black cosmic string which is asymptotically anti - desitter .",
    "the field is in the hartle - hawking vacuum state @xcite and the stress - energy tensor is found using the approximation of page @xcite which is particularly useful here since the spacetime is an einstein spacetime ( in an einstein spacetime the relation @xmath3 holds ) .",
    "black string solutions are of relevance to cosmic strings .",
    "it has also been shown how such black holes may form by gravitational collapse @xcite @xcite .",
    "this type of collapse has astrophysical relevance as the collapse of a finite spindle can behave as an infinite cylinder near its central region @xcite .",
    "it may be thought that , since no external observer can view the interior without falling into the black hole , that a study of the interior is not physically meaningful .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite black hole evaporation reveals more and more of the black hole interior as time progresses and therefore the interior has relevance to exterior observers in this way .",
    "also , the issue of whether or not spacetime singularities actually exist has been one of intense interest ever since oppenheimer and snyder s @xcite original collapse calculation .",
    "the black hole studied here is the cylindrical black hole spacetime developed by lemos and zanchin @xcite and also studied by kaloper @xcite .",
    "if charge and angular momentum are not present the metric has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass per unit length , @xmath6 and the coordinates take on the following ranges : @xmath7 an event horizon exists at @xmath8 and the cosmological constant ( which is negative and necessary for cylindrical black hole solutions ) , @xmath9 , dominates in the limit @xmath10 giving the spacetime its asymptotically anti - desitter behaviour .",
    "the apparently singular behaviour of the spacetime at @xmath11 is a coordinate effect and not a true singularity . on calculating the kretschmann scalar one obtains @xmath12 from which it can be seen that the only true singularity is a polynomial singularity at @xmath13 .",
    "thus , this solution violates the hoop conjecture but not the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "the hoop conjecture is therefore not valid in spacetimes with a cosmological constant .",
    "as calculations will be extended to the interior , it is convenient to re - write the metric using the following coordinate redefinitions : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is timelike in the interior and @xmath16 is spacelike .",
    "the  interior \" metric now has the form @xmath17 where the interior region corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "in this section the stress energy tensor is calculated which will eventually be used in ( [ eq : einst ] ) to calculate back - reaction effects .",
    "the expectation value of stress - energy tensors have been calculated in exterior schwarzschild spacetime by howard and candelas @xcite and page @xcite as well as by anderson et .",
    "al @xcite who studied the stability in the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "anderson , hiscock and samuel @xcite have developed an approximation for both massive and massless fields in arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes and have used this approximation to calculate @xmath1  in the exterior reissner - nordstrm geometry .",
    "the kerr and kerr - newman spacetimes have also been studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quantum effects in lower dimensional black hole exteriors may be found in @xcite-@xcite . for a calculation of @xmath0  in the spacetime studied here",
    "see @xcite .    various works on back - reaction effects of quantum fields",
    "have also been produced .",
    "hiscock and weems @xcite , bardeen @xcite , balbinot @xcite and york @xcite have studied effects in schwazschild and reissner - nordstrm exteriors .",
    "few calculations , however , have been performed on the interiors of black holes .",
    "one such study has been done by hiscock , larson and anderson @xcite where they have extended their analysis to the schwarzschild interior and calculated back - reaction effects on curvature invariants .",
    "the calculation of the stress energy tensor will be done using the eucldeanized metric .",
    "this is obtained by making the transformation ( @xmath19 ) in ( [ eq : metric ] ) giving the metric positive definite signature so that @xmath20 to calculate @xmath1  exactly is an extremely difficult task which normally involves acting on @xmath0  with a complicated differential operator .",
    "it is useful therefore to use an approximation which will give an analytic result from which information on back - reaction effects may be calculated .",
    "the approximation used here is the approximation of page for thermal stress - energy tensors in static spacetimes@xcite .",
    "this approximation is especially good if the spacetime under consideration is an einstein spacetime such as the one considered here and contains no ambiguities in the case of scalar fields .",
    "the bekenstein - parker @xcite gaussian path integral approximation is utilized from which the thermal propagator is constructed .",
    "this construction is done in an ( euclideanized ) ultrastatic spacetime ( @xmath21 is a constant chosen to be @xmath22 in this work ) which is related to the physical spacetime by @xmath23 the subscript @xmath24 will be used to indicate quantities calculated using the physical metric ( all other tensors in this section are obtained using the ultrastatic metric ) .",
    "this approximation gives , for the stress - energy tensor in the physical spacetime : @xmath25c^{\\alpha\\mu}_{\\beta\\nu}+   2\\beta [ h^{\\mu}_{\\nu}+3\\alpha^{4}|g_{00\\,\\,(p)}|^{2}\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}]+   \\frac{1}{6}\\gamma i^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\rbrace , \\label{eq : tmn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the weyl tensor and the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given as follows : @xmath29 the number of helicity states , @xmath30 , simply counts the number of scalar fields present .",
    "@xmath31 is the stress - energy tensor in the ultrastatic metric , @xmath32 were @xmath15 is the temperature of the black string which can be found by demanding that the euclidean extension of ( [ eq : metric ] ) be regular on the horizon ; @xmath33 the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by : @xmath36    the calculation of @xmath1  is carried out on the exterior of the black hole . however ,",

    "the qualitative behaviour of the energy density ( @xmath42 ) is shown in figure 1 where it can be seen that the wec is violated throughout the interior of the black hole ( @xmath43 ) .",

    "since solving ( [ eq : e1]-[eq : e4 ] ) using ( [ eq : setensor ] ) and calculating the resulting relevant quantities such as the riemann curvature tensor and kretschmann scalar would be an enourmous task , some simplifying assumptions are first made .",
