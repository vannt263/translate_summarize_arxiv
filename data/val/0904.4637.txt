    "knowledge of thermodynamic properties , and in particular vapor - liquid equilibria ( vle ) , is important for many problems in science and engineering . among the state - of - the - art thermodynamic models , molecular based approaches have the highest potential to yield significant improvements compared to existing phenomenological approaches , especially in terms of predictive power .",

    "<S> twelve two - center lennard - jones plus point dipole and point quadrupole model fluids ( 2cljdq ) are studied for different reduced dipolar moments @xmath0 , 12 , reduced quadrupolar moments @xmath1 , 4 and reduced elongations @xmath2 , 0.505 , 1 . </S>",
    "<S> temperatures cover a wide range from about 55 % to about 95 % of the critical temperature of each fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 + test particle method is used for the calculation of vapor pressure , saturated densities and saturated enthalpies . </S>",
    "<S> critical data and the acentric factor are obtained from fits to the simulation data . on the basis of this data , an eos contribution for the dipole - quadrupole cross - interactions of </S>",
    "<S> non - spherical molecules is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the expression is based on a third - order perturbation theory and the model constants are adjusted to the present 2cljdq simulation results . when applied to mixtures </S>",
