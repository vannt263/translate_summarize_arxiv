    "a popular theme in the study of brownian motion is the properties and structure of certain compact sets associated with , or generated by , the process .",
    "although this endeavour originally started by examining the lebesgue measure of such sets , very interesting results were obtained when considering hausdorff and , subsequently , fourier dimensions . in this paper , we take the following as our definition of ( one dimensional ) brownian motion :    [ def:1 ] given a probability space @xmath0 , a _ brownian motion _ is a stochastic process @xmath1 from @xmath2 $ ] to @xmath3 satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "each path @xmath4\\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] is almost surely continuous 2 .",
    "@xmath5 almost surely 3 .   for @xmath6 , the random variables @xmath7 are independent and normally distributed with mean @xmath8 and variance @xmath9 .",
    "khinchine s famous law of the iterated logarithm ( see , for instance , p67 of @xcite ) describes the local growth of brownian motion at almost all points of the unit interval .",
    "we state the theorem for completeness .",
    "since the notation will not cause any confusion , we will usually denote the sample path @xmath10\\to\\mathbb{r}$ ] of a brownian motion simply by @xmath11 .",
    "[ thm:1 ] for @xmath1 a one dimensional brownian motion as above , we have that for any prescribed @xmath12 on @xmath13 $ ] @xmath14",
    "this implies that almost all points in the unit interval are points of  ordinary \" growth .",
    "though of lebesgue measure @xmath8 , the set of points that violate this growth condition have other fascinating properties .",
    "the points of exceptional growth we will consider are known as rapid points .",
    "[ def:2 ] @xmath15 is called an @xmath16-rapid point of the sample path @xmath1 if @xmath17    ( we can define the rapid points of any continuous function @xmath18 analogously by replacing the sample path @xmath1 with @xmath18 in the above . )    orey and taylor  @xcite showed that the set of @xmath16-rapid points has hausdorff dimension @xmath19 , almost surely , and shortly afterwards kaufman proved they have equal fourier dimension  @xcite .",
    "we shall not delve into the theory of fourier dimension as it relates to stochastic processes here , but the interested reader is referred to @xcite for a thorough exploration .",
    "the result of orey and taylor is very relevant to the investigations of this paper .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] provides an elementary proof of the result , elements of which are used to prove subsequent results on complex oscillations",
    ".    there has been much activity recently connecting the theory of descriptive complexity with that of brownian motion . _",
    "complex oscillations _ were introduced by asarin and pokrovskii  @xcite , being functions which are the limit of piecewise linear functions encoded by strings of high kolmogorov - chaitin complexity .",
    "it was shown that the set @xmath20 of complex oscillations , also known as generic brownian motion , has wiener measure @xmath21 .",
    "fouch  @xcite proved that there exists a recursive bijection between the set of kolmogorov - chaitin random strings ( kc - strings , from hereon ) and encoded versions of the complex oscillations .",
    "the set @xmath20 may be considered an effective representation of brownian motion , since every property which holds almost surely for a brownian motion also holds for a complex oscillation , provided it has a suitably effective description  @xcite .",
    "fouch showed in @xcite that iterated logarithmic growth is satisfied at all recursive points in @xmath13 $ ] and posed the question , whether iterated logarithmic growth holds with lebesgue measure @xmath21 .",
    "this was answered in the positive by kjos - hanssen and nerode  @xcite .",
    "the question now becomes whether orey and taylor s result also holds for complex oscillations , which is what we attempt to answer in this paper .",
    "complex oscillations , or generic brownian motion , is also known in the literature as algorithmically random brownian motion . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we shall keep to the term  complex oscillations \" , as oft repetition favours the shorter form .",
    "it is also the author s preference , since it not only refers to the origins of the subject in kolmogorov complexity , but also distinguishes it from brownian motion as a distinct , albeit related , phenomenon .",
    "we employ some nonstandard analysis in the next section .",
    "the purpose is merely to facilitate the conversion of some standard inequalities into a calculation of the hausdorff dimension of the @xmath16-rapid points , following the method in @xcite , without having to resort to more cumbersome covering arguments .",
    "it should not be too difficult for readers who do not wish to delve into the nonstandard background to convince themselves that dimension may be calculated by a method of counting intervals .",
    "as mentioned , section  [ sec:3 ] provides an elementary proof of the theorem of orey and taylor .",
    "although the supporting lemmas were formulated largely to support the main result on complex oscillations , it seemed appropriate to complete the train of thought in this fashion .",
    "the advantage of this method of proof is that it lends itself well to more constructive applications , as in the sequel .",
    "a concise exposition of the most relevant definitions and results on complex oscillations are presented at the start of section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the results of the previous sections are then applied to show that the @xmath16-rapid points of a complex oscillation do indeed have hausdorff dimension @xmath19 .",
    "the methods used throughout to approximate sets of rapid points are based upon kaufman s approximations in the paper @xcite .",
    "some familiarity with nonstandard analysis is assumed . for a full explanation of the concepts",
    "involved ,  @xcite provides an excellent introduction .",

    "this result guarantees the existence of a subset of the hyperfinite time line through which hausdorff dimension can be computed using a counting argument , but the following result shows that any set which satisfies certain properties can be used :    [ thm:3 ] consider a hyperfinite time line @xmath48 based on the hyperfinite number @xmath53 , for a given @xmath54 .",
    "suppose that a subset @xmath55 of the time line is such that @xmath56 and for some @xmath57 @xmath58 then @xmath59 .",

    "let @xmath67 be the event @xmath68 the sets of the form @xmath65 do not form a cover of the rapid points at each stage @xmath69 .",

    "moreover , the same argument can be made for the rapid points approximable from the left in such a manner , yielding the same bounds on the hausdorff dimension , hence achieving the desired result for all @xmath16-rapid points .",
    "we now estimate the probability of @xmath67 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath70 is binomial and the probability of a success ( of a point @xmath71 $ ] being in @xmath67 ) is calculated in @xcite to be larger than @xmath72 .",

    "although the compactness of the set ensures that we could find a finite subcover , we do not actually need to find such a cover here , since the number of intervals used is small enough .",
    "if we now consider the @xmath89-hausdorff sum for the cover of @xmath22 obtained by the above process , we get an expression smaller than @xmath90 which is bounded , as long as we have chosen , for instance , @xmath91 for all @xmath92 . since the above sum is clearly larger than that of any @xmath89-hausdorff sum for any dyadic cover of the lim sup of the sets @xmath93 ,",

    "the hyperfinite dyadic rationals included in the transferred relation therefore exist in the monad ( infinitesimal neighbourhood ) of an @xmath16-rapid point .",

    "this clearly tends to @xmath8 and thus the probability of more than @xmath127 successes in @xmath75 trials goes to @xmath21 .",

    "let @xmath238,\\ ] ] which therefore describes the event of all intervals in @xmath237 being non - rapid . since each of the @xmath239 can be described as an effective conjunction of elements of the algebra , we can find a recursive function @xmath240 for an effective enumeration @xmath241 of the algebra ( with @xmath242 assumed to be @xmath243 ) such that @xmath244 .",
    "the function @xmath245 is however not total , but can easily be extended to be such by setting @xmath246 for @xmath247 previously undefined .",
    "we form the sets @xmath248 which then form a uniform sequence of @xmath249 sets . if we can show that @xmath250 , we know that for any @xmath251 , @xmath252 for large @xmath215 .",
    "this would mean that for each @xmath253 , we are unable to choose more than @xmath236 non - rapid intervals , implying that there must be @xmath254 rapid intervals .",
    "but we have shown in the proof of lemma  [ lem:3 ] that the probability of such an event @xmath255 for each @xmath69 is less than @xmath256 , which completes the argument .",

    "<S> by considering a counting - type argument on brownian sample paths , we prove a result similar to that of orey and taylor on the exact hausdorff dimension of the rapid points of brownian motion . because of the nature of the proof we can then apply the concepts to so - called _ complex oscillations _ ( or _ algorithmically random brownian motion _ ) , showing that their rapid points have the same dimension . </S>"
