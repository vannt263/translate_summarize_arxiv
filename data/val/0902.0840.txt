    "in the context of recent discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray luminosity during the giant flare of sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 that were interpreted as being produced by torsional vibrations of quaking magnetars ( israel et al .",

    "2009a , 2009b ) several scenarios of the post - quake vibrational relaxation of a neutron star model with uniform internal and dipolar external magnetic field @xmath0 have been studied on the basis of equations of newtonian magneto - solid - mechanics @xmath1,\\quad",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations describe the lorentz - force - driven non - compressional ( @xmath2 ) fluctuations of star matter about axis of above fossil magnetic field @xmath3 in terms of fluctuating material displacements @xmath4 ( the basic dynamical variable of solid mechanics ) and the magnetic field @xmath5 . it is implied that elastic stellar material is of an extremely high electrical conductivity .",
    "the chief argument for interpreting qpos during the outbursts of above mentioned sgrs ( detected on descending branch of the giant flare light - curves ) as caused by torsional vibrations of a solid star driven by restoring force of magnetic field stresses is that it is an ultra strong magnetic field frozen - in the entire volume of magnetars serves as the main energy source and promoter of their x - ray bursting seismic activity ( e.g. , woods & thompson 2006 , mereghetti 2008 ) and , also , bearing in mind the fact that the very notion of torsional vibrations has come into theoretical seismology from the solid - mechanical theory of shear vibrations of an elastic sphere ( e.g. lapwood , & usami 1981 , lay & wallace 1995 , aki & richards 2002 , stein & wyssesson 2003 ) .",
    "it worthy noting that theoretical investigations of non - radial torsional alfvn oscillations of a fluid star in its own homogeneous magnetic field have a long story that was started , to the best of our knowledge , in works of jensen ( 1955 ) and plumpton & ferraro ( 1955 ) .",
    "remarkably that in the latter paper , by emphasizing the basic discovery of alfvn that perfectly conducting fluid threaded by magnetic field behaves like anisotropic elastic medium capable of transmitting mechanical disturbance by transverse hydromagnetic waves ( e.g. flthammar 2007 ) , it is argued that eigenfrequency problem of such vibrations can be tackled on the basis of equation @xmath6]\\times { \\bf b},\\quad \\nabla\\cdot   { \\bf u}=0,\\quad \\nabla\\cdot { \\bf b}=0    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , as is evident , follows form equations ( [ e1.3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear from this last equation that the frequencies of alfvn oscillations must substantially depend on both geometrical configuration of internal equilibrium magnetic field @xmath3 and analytic form of oscillating field of material displacements @xmath7 . with this obvious observation in mind , in ( bastrukov et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) focus was laid on non - investigated before regime of large lengthscale nodeless alfvn oscillations , both global ( in the entire spherical volume of star ) and crustal ( locked in the peripheral finite - depth spherical layer ) .",
    "the most conspicuous feature of this regime is that the radial dependence of oscillating material displacements field @xmath7 has no nodes . in a star undergoing global nodeless torsional oscillations , which are of particular interest for our present discussion ,",
    "the fluctuating material displacements are described by the toroidal field of the form ( bastrukov et al 2007a , 2007b , 2009a ) @xmath8\\,\\alpha(t),\\quad \\alpha(t)=\\alpha_0\\cos\\omega t,\\\\    \\label{e1.6 }    & & \\delta { \\bf v}({\\bf r},t)={\\dot { \\bf u}}({\\bf r},t)=[\\delta \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$}({\\bf r},t)\\times { \\bf r } ] , \\quad    \\delta\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$}({\\bf r},t)=\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}({\\bf r})\\,{\\dot \\alpha}(t),\\\\   \\label{e1.7 }   & & \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}({\\bf r})=\\nabla\\chi({\\bf r}),\\quad \\nabla^2\\chi({\\bf r})=0,\\quad \\chi({\\bf r})=   \\frac{{\\cal",

    "one of reasons of this discrepancy may be inadequate assumption about homogeneous configuration of internal magnetic field and perhaps the most efficient way to clarify this conjecture is to investigate a model with geometrically different configuration of axisymmetric internal magnetic field . before so doing it seems worth noting that the model of a star with _ homogeneous _",
    "internal and dipolar external magnetic field has come into focus in astrophysics after seminal work of chandrasekhar and fermi ( 1953 ) in which the effect of mechanical flattening of the star at the poles of such magnetic field has been disclosed . shortly after",
    ", similar conclusion has been drawn in outstanding paper of ferraro ( 1954 ) , but on the basis of star model with substantially _ nonhomogeneous _ internal and dipole - like axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field @xmath16 where @xmath14 stands for the magnetic field intensity at the poles and @xmath17 as should be the case , with this nonhomogeneous ( nh ) internal magnetic field @xmath18 is somewhat larger than in the star with homogeneous ( h ) magnetic field @xmath19 . ] .",
    "the meridian cross section of ferraro s model of the star is sketched in fig.2 .        over the years , the different aspects , both mathematical and astrophysical , of ferraro s model have been the subject of extensive investigations ( e.g. chandrasekhar & prendergast 1955 , robetrs 1955 , chandrasekhar 1956 , mestel 1956 , ledoux & walraven 1958 , monaghan 1965 , ledoux & renson 1966 , sood & trehan 1970 , goossens 1972 , goossens , smeyers & denis 1976 ) .",
    "the effects of ferraro s configuration of magnetic field ( and magnetic fields of similar geometrical configuration ) on the equilibrium shape , vibrational behavior and electromagnetic activity of pulsars and magnetars are considered in ( roberts 1981 , ioka 2001 , braithwaite & spruit 2006 , geppert & rheinhardt 2006 , haskell et al 2008 , lee 2008 ; broderick & narayan 2008 , see also references therein ) .    in this work we focus on",
    "the non - studied before regime of global torsional alfvn nodeless vibrations of neutron star about axis of ferraro s magnetic field ( [ e1.10])-([e1.12 ] ) . in section 2 ,",
    "the frequency spectrum of this toroidal mode is derived and compared with the frequency spectrum ( [ e1.8 ] ) of the neutron star model with homogeneous internal magnetic field . in section 3 ,",
    "the obtained spectral formula for the frequency is analyzed numerically in juxtaposition with data on qpos during the flare of sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "section 4 briefly accounts for the net outcome of this work .",
    "technical details of analytic computations can be found in appendix .",
    "in the model under consideration a neutron star is identified with a finite spherical mass of an elastic solid , regarded as an incompressible continuous medium of uniform density @xmath20 and an infinite electrical conductivity , whose vibrations under the action of lorentz magnetic force are governed by equations of magneto - solid - mechanics ( [ e1.2 ] ) which can conveniently be represented in the following equivalent tensor form ( e.g. mestel 1999 ) @xmath21 , \\\\    & & \\delta b_i({\\bf r},t)=(b_k \\nabla_k)u_i-(u_k\\nabla_k ) b_i,\\quad \\nabla_i u_i=0    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 stands for the maxwell s tensor of magnetic field stresses .",

    "it follows from hamiltonian of normal vibrations , @xmath45 , that in this dipole case a star sets in rigid - body rotation , rather than vibrations , about axis of its dipole magnetic moment ; this feature of the model under consideration is quite similar to that of the neutron star model with homogeneous internal magnetic field . in fig 3 .",
    ", we plot the frequency @xmath46 and the period @xmath47 of the alfvn toroidal mode as functions of multipole degree computed in both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous neutron star models with indicated parameters .",
    "as was mentioned , the one - parametric spectral formula ( [ e1.8 ] ) , computed in the neutron star model with homogeneous internal and dipolar external magnetic field , does not reproduce general trends in data on qpos frequencies whose numerical values for sgr 1806 - 20 are given by @xmath4818 , 26 , 30 , 92 , 150 , 625 , 1840 and for the sgr 1900 + 14 these are @xmath4828 , 54 , 84 , 155 ( watts & strohmayer 2007 ) .",
    "it is tempting , therefore , to consider these data from the view point of investigated model by identifying the observed qpos with overtones of spectral formula ( [ e2.14 ] ) .",
    "the result of @xmath10-pole modal specification of the detected qpos frequencies as overtones of torsional alfvn seismic vibrations in question is presented in fig.4 and fig.5 .",
    "specifically , for sgr 1900 + 14 we obtain : @xmath49 hz ; @xmath50 ; hz @xmath51 hz ; @xmath52 hz , and for the sgr 1806 - 20 we get @xmath53 hz ; @xmath54 , @xmath55 hz ; @xmath56 hz ; @xmath57 hz and @xmath58 hz . while the lowest of detected oscillations , with @xmath59 hz , can not be specified in terms of considered seismic vibrations , it is clearly seen that the obtained spectrum correctly reflects general trends in the detected qpo frequencies .",
    "this suggests , if the detected qpos are really produced by lorentz - force - driven global nodeless torsional seismic vibrations about the dipole magnetic moment of magnetars , their internal magnetic fields should be of substantially nonhomogeneous configuration .",

    "any attempt to predict the behavior of alfvn vibrational modes in pulsars and magnetars , presuming of course that the star material possesses properties of perfectly conducting continuous medium pervaded by magnetic fields , is beset with uncertainties regarding geometrical configuration of fossil internal magnetic field .",
    "it seems , therefore , that progress can be best made by studying these modes within the framework of comprehensive models . among these",
    "are the models with homogeneous and nonhomogeneous axisymmetric poloidal magnetic fields considered long ago in works of chandrasekhar and fermi ( 1953 ) and by ferraro ( 1954 ) , respectively , to show that such fields have the same effect as rigid rotation , that is , tend to produce a flattening of the star shape along the magnetic field axis . following this line of argument and continuing investigations reported in ( bastrukov et al 2009a ) ,",
    "we have computed here the frequency spectrum of axisymmetric torsional nodeless vibrations , in the neutron star model with ferraro s form of nonhomogeneous poloidal magnetic field which is presented in fig.3 in juxtaposition in a neutron star model with homogeneous internal field .",
    "the practical usefulness of the obtained one - parametric spectral formula has been demonstrated by its application to @xmath10-pole identification of qpos frequencies during the x - ray giant outbursts of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "the result of our analysis , summarized in fig.4 and fig.5 , shows that the model adequately regains the overall trends in the detected qpos frequencies and , thus , supports theoretical interpretation of these qpos , advanced in works reporting this discovery ( israel et al 2005 , watts & strohmayer 2006 ) , as owing their origin to quake - induced torsional seismic vibrations of underlying magnetar .",
    "together with this , in ( bastrukov et al 2009b ) it has been shown that the same data on the qpo frequencies can be consistently interpreted from the view point of two - component , core - crust , model of quaking neutron star ( franco et al . 2000 ) with homogeneous internal magnetic field as being produced by axisymmetric differentially rotational alfvn nodeless oscillations of crustal solid - state plasma about axis of magnetic field frozen in the immobile core .",
    "with all these in mind , we conclude that it is the lorentz force of magnetic field stresses plays decisive part in post - quake vibrational relaxation of above magnetars and that the toroidal fields of quake - induced material displacements are of substantially nodeless character .",
