    "the @xmath4dimensional anti  de sitter space @xmath9 is a homogeneous space with constant negative curvature and cosmological constant .",
    "its symmetry group @xmath10 plays the role of the @xmath4dimensional poincar group , which is recovered in the flat limit by a contraction .",
    "it is of considerable interest in theoretical physics for several reasons .",
    "for example , it can be used as a simple model for field theory on curved spaces @xcite , and it arises naturally in the context of supergravity @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting conjecture relating string or m theory on @xmath11 with ( super)conformal field theories on the boundary has been proposed @xcite , where @xmath12 is a certain sphere or a product space containing a sphere .",
    "moreover , there is some evidence that a full quantum treatment would lead to some non  classical version of the manifolds .",
    "this includes the appearance of a `` stringy exclusion principle '' @xcite in the spectrum of fields on ads space .    in this paper",
    ", we study a non  commutative version of the ads space , which is covariant under the standard drinfeld  jimbo quantum group @xmath13 .",
    "it can be understood as a quantization of a certain poisson structure on the classical ads space , where @xmath14 is a deformation parameter which plays the role of the planck constant . in principle , this is can be done for real @xmath0 and @xmath0 a phase . for real @xmath0 ,",
    "the qualitative features of quantum groups and spaces are typically similar to the classical case ; in particular , no cutoff is expected .    here",
    "we consider the case where @xmath0 is a root of unity .",
    "it is well  known that then quantum groups show completely new , `` non  perturbative '' features ; roughly speaking , phenomena which are typical for infinite  dimensional of classical non  compact groups occur already with finite  dimensional representations . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that there exist finite  dimensional unitary of the quantum ads groups at roots of unity @xcite , where all the features of the classical case are consistently combined with a cutoff .    the correct definition of quantum  ads space for @xmath0 a phase is not obvious ;",
    "different versions have been proposed in the literature @xcite , which are not very satisfactory or incomplete .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to clarify this situation , and to give a precise definition in terms of operators on hilbert spaces . to find the proper definition ,",
    "we make 2 basic assumptions : 1 ) covariance under the @xmath0deformed universal enveloping algebra @xmath2 , and 2 ) allowing only finite  dimensional representations , hence insisting on a full regularization and avoiding `` @xmath0analysis '' .",
    "it is very remarkable that this is indeed possible , while maintaining the correct low ",
    "energy limit .    as we will show , these assumptions lead to an algebra of functions on the complexified quantum sphere , which decomposes into different sectors corresponding to different real forms .",
    "they describe the compact sphere @xmath8 and certain noncompact forms , in particular the quantum anti  de sitter space @xmath15",
    ". this will provide us with scalar fields which are unitary of @xmath2 , and correspond to the classical square  integrable scalar fields on ads space , describing spin 0 elementary particles . the remarkable difference to the classical case is that all this happens within the framework of polynomial functions , whose properties are completely different from the classical case .",
    "nevertheless , the classical fields are recovered in the limit of @xmath0 approaching 1 .",
    "in particular , this allows to study questions of functional analysis in the classical case with purely algebraic methods .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that the definition of @xmath15 implies a number of additional , unexpected features .",
    "they include the appearance of an additional undeformed symmetry group @xmath16 if @xmath4 is odd and @xmath17 if @xmath4 is even , which are in some sense spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the quantum spaces are obtained most naturally as product of the quantum ads space ( or sphere ) with a classical sphere .",
    "more precisely , one obtains the products @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a certain `` chiral '' sector of @xmath22 .",
    "the quotients of the classical spaces are actually twisted sectors of orbifolds .",
    "it should be emphasized that no specific assumptions have been made here , it is simply a consequence of the remarkable structures that appear at roots of unity .",
    "of course , this is quite intriguing in the context of the ads ",
    "cft correspondence mentioned above , since we obtain @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are precisely cases of interest there ( apart from the `` chiral sector '' of @xmath25 , whose meaning is not entirely clear ) .",
    "these and other physical aspects will be discussed further in section 7 .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "some basic facts about quantum groups and spaces are reviewed , including aspects of the theory at roots of unity which will be needed . in section 3 , we discuss in detail the meaning of reality structures , and determine the real form of the quantum ads group @xmath26 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a closer analysis of the structure of polynomial functions on the complex quantum spaces at roots of unity . in section 5 ,",
    "we identify different noncompact sectors , which leads to the definition of hilbert spaces of scalar fields .",
    "their product structure with classical spheres is analyzed in section 5.2 .",
    "sections 5.3 and 5.4 are mathematical interludes , and will allow us to write down explicitly the star structure of the real quantum spaces in theorems 5.3 and 5.4 , which are some of the main results of this work . in section 6 , we comment on further developments towards formulating physical models , and propose an on  shell condition which is somewhat reminiscent of string theory .",
    "some physical aspects are discussed in section 7 .",
    "the appendices include several proofs that were omitted in the text , as well an exposition of the vector of @xmath27 for convenience .",
    "some advice to the reader : in sections 5.3 and 5.4 , the star structure is defined in several steps , and considerable effort is made to give the precise mathematical definitions and to explain why it is the correct one .",
    "however the final result , theorems 5.3 and 5.4 can be stated very briefly .",
    "thus the reader who is not interested in the mathematical details may skip much of these sections and simply accept the results .",
    "we first recall the classical anti  de sitter space @xmath28 , which is a @xmath29 dimensional manifold with constant negative curvature and signature @xmath30 . it can be embedded in a @xmath4dimensional flat space with signature @xmath31 by z_1 ^ 2+z_d^2-z_2 ^ 2- ...",

    "the group of isometries of this space is @xmath33 , which plays the role of the @xmath29 dimensional poincar group .",
    "this space has some rather peculiar features .",

    "the space  like geodesics are unbounded .",
    "there exist nice unitary positive  energy of @xmath33 which correspond to elementary particles with arbitrary spin .",
    "it is also worth recalling that @xmath33 is the conformal group in @xmath36 dimensions acting on @xmath37 dimensional minkowski space , which can be interpreted as the boundary of @xmath28 .    to define the noncommutative version , we first review some basic facts about the @xmath0deformed orthogonal group and euclidean space @xcite ; for a more detailed discussion see e.g. @xcite .",

    "we also define d_s = ( _1,_1 ) , m_s = m / d_s , so that @xmath135 which was used above .",
    "it is well  known @xcite that for generic @xmath0 , the representation theory is essentially the same as in the classical case . in particular , all finite  dimensional ( = modules ) of @xmath118 are direct sums of some @xmath126 .",

    "casimir @xmath139 ( [ v ] ) on @xmath126 ( and on any highest  weight module with highest weight @xmath122 ) was first determined in @xcite : v w = q^-c_ w w l^res( ) , [ v_h_w ] where @xmath140 is the value of the _ classical _ quadratic casimir on @xmath141 .",

    "finally , we quote a few important facts about irreducible at roots of unity .",
    "the first one @xcite states that the structure of @xmath143 with `` small '' highest weight @xmath122 is the same as classically :    assume that @xmath122 is a dominant integral weight with @xmath144 for all positive roots @xmath114",

    "the structure of @xmath126 is difficult to analyze .",
    "however for the `` special weights '' _z = m_i z_i _i z_i [ l_z ] it can be understood easily , and this will be the key for much of the following .",
    "the relation ( [ uea ] ) together with ( [ m_i ] ) implies that for any highest weight module @xmath148 with highest weight @xmath149 , _",
    "i:= x_i^- w__z is a highest weight vector ( possibly zero ) for any @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath151 for all @xmath152 .",
    "because @xmath153 is irreducible by definition , it follows that x_i^- w__z=0 i [ x_i_0_l ] in @xmath153 .",
    "in particular , the irreducible @xmath154 of @xmath155 are one  dimensional .",
    "however the `` large '' generators @xmath156 do act nontrivially on @xmath153 , as we will see next .    using the commutation relations , any element of @xmath157",
    "can be written as a sum of terms of the form @xmath158 .",
    "it follows that all weights of @xmath153 have the form @xmath159 with @xmath160 . in other words",
    ", @xmath161 is a direct sum of one  dimensional @xmath162 of @xmath120 , since all @xmath163 are special points .",
    "in fact , the weights @xmath149 have the structure of a weight lattice with `` fundamental weights '' @xmath164 .",
    "this turns out to be the rescaled lattice of a dual lie algebra @xmath165 , with cartan matrix @xmath166 provided ( [ q_root ] ) holds @xcite . in the present case , @xmath167 if @xmath4 is even , and @xmath168 if @xmath4 is odd .",
