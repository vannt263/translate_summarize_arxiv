    "the hst medium deep survey ( mds ) ( @xcite ) , has comprised parallel wfpc2 observations of just over 400 random fields for the systematic study of the evolution of faint galaxies , as well as being a serendipitous survey which has resulted in the discovery of many interesting objects . the survey has provided a unique set of data for over 150,000 galaxies wherein the selection of a correspondingly large number of field galaxies has been possible down to i@xmath025 ( @xcite ) . the discovery of two quadruple - type lenses from the hst mds , viz .",
    "hst 12531@xmath12914 and hst 14176@xmath25226 has previously been reported ( @xcite ) and subsequent spectroscopic observations of hst 14176@xmath25226 have provided confirmation that the system is indeed a gravitational lens ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations and modeling of lens systems can be used to constrain directly the distribution of dark matter in the lensing galaxies .",
    "the characteristic separation @xmath3 of lensed images depends on the total lensing mass and the distances between the observer , the lens , and the source object .",
    "this allows the mass - to - light ratio of the lens galaxy to be determined directly if the lens and source redshifts are known .",
    "the shape of the lensing mass distribution can also be constrained , using the configuration and light distribution of the lensed images .",
    "gravitational lenses can also be used to provide constraints on the geometry of the universe .",
    "the image separations @xmath3 depend on the angular size distances to the lens and background source , which in turn depend on global cosmology . in order to measure the cosmological constant @xmath4 , for instance",
    ", it has been suggested that strong gravitational lenses might be used , i.e. isolated galaxies or clusters of galaxies for which the gravitational potential results in multiple imaging of a background source object ( @xcite ) .",
    "the use of the lens number counts ( or the optical depth ) has also been advocated since this is very sensitive to @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have applied this method , obtaining upper limits of @xmath5 .",
    "predictions of lensing probabilities by galaxies are very sensitive to @xmath4 . if @xmath6 , for example , we would expect to see about 10 times more lensed systems than if @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "lensing constraints on cosmology are not entirely free from systematic errors , however .",
    "the biggest problem is the lack of information on the lens galaxies at @xmath8 , which still allows significant error in the estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "elliptical galaxies dominate the expected lensing rates , due to the large concentration of mass near their centers ( e.g. @xcite ) , so any statistical bias needs be determined by comparing the non - lensing elliptical galaxies at comparable redshifts .    at the faint magnitudes @xmath9 surveyed by the hst mds we might expect to discover a few gravitational lenses in each square degree of sky .",
    "unfortunately the total area of sky surveyed by the wfpc2 is still under about 1 square degree , and most of the lens candidates discovered are too small and faint for ground based spectroscopic follow - up with even the largest telescopes .",
    "the sample we are locating today probably needs the next generation of space based instrumentation for more detailed studies .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that , for the same lens galaxy population that is responsible for the known lensed radio sources , there should be @xmath10 lensed faint galaxies per square degree . with small image separations ( @xmath11 ) and faint background sources , these lensed systems can not be detected from the ground .",
    "however , they should be readily detectable using hst observations , and could represent the largest untapped mine of lensed systems . a large statistical sample would greatly increase the importance of lensing for studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology .    among the sample of field galaxies in the mds",
    ", we have discovered ten gravitational lens candidates .",
    "the discovery of two lenses hst 12531@xmath12914 and hst 14176@xmath25226 ( figures  1 - 2 ) has been reported already ( @xcite ) and the spectroscopic observation of hst 14176@xmath25226 has provided confirmation that the system is a gravitational lens ( @xcite ) . the other eight lens candidates were discovered subsequently , and their hst images are shown in figures  3 - 10 , in the light of filters f814w ( i ) , f606w ( v ) and , when available , f450w ( b ) .",
    "each image extracted from an hst wfpc2 observation is @xmath12 on each side . typically , the lensed ( source ) images are blue arcs , while the lensing galaxy appears to be a red elliptical galaxy , thus making them very good candidates for gravitational lensing .",
    "a two - dimensional image fitting procedure was developed to model the first two hst lenses , as described in @xcite .",
    "this simple modeling approach used singular isothermal ellipsoid potentials ( @xcite ) , and this same approach was applied to each of the gravitational lenses to derive the best fitting model in each case .",
    "our approach does not require careful astrometry or photometric measurement of the faint , under - sampled wfpc2 images .",
    "the model is derived by fitting the full 2d - image rather than a list of estimated positions and magnitudes .",
    "this approach , which is more cpu intensive , makes use of the full extended nature of the light distribution of lens and lensed images and also uses the observational errors associated with each image pixel .",
    "the choice of the number of parameters fitted was done interactively so as to obtain a good convergence while not exceeding the number of significant parameters .    in a few cases",
    "the system was observed in several filters and the lensed images in through some filters were too faint or not sufficiently well resolved from the brighter lens galaxies . for these cases it was not possible to fit all the parameters and for the adopted model we took the geometric parameters and the description of the potential from the filter",
    "in which the system was observed best .",
    "the centroid of the gravitational potential of the lens was assumed to be the same as that of the light of the lensing galaxy .",
    "the axis ratio and orientation of the mass ( potential ) were left as free parameters in the model .",
    "if the lensed object is extended with a half - light radius larger than a pixel , then the axis ratio and orientation of the lensed galaxy were left as free parameters .",
    "the image profiles of the lens and the lensed objects were selected to be disk - like or bulge - like . if the lensed object was point - like within the wfpc2 resolution then a gaussian profile was adopted . in a few cases the lens was better fitted by a disk - plus - bulge model as could be seen when the lens galaxy was analyzed alone through the regular mds pipeline analysis software .",
    "however , to keep the modeling simple and limit the number of parameters fitted , the lens was modeled with a single component .",
    "images of the candidate lenses in each filter are illustrated for f814w ( i ) , f606w ( v ) and when available f450w ( b ) , from the top down . on each horizontal strip of five objects",
    ", we have from left to right 1 ) the region selected for analysis , 2 ) the model of the wfpc2 observation , 3 ) the model without convolution by the hst psf , 4 ) the residual image after subtraction of the model image from the observed image and 5 ) the model without the lensing galaxy .",
    "the corresponding tables give the fitted parameters , with errors for each model .",
    "more details and fits files of the observations and fitted models are available from the mds website http://archive.stsci.edu / mds/.",
    "* hst 14176 + 5226 * is the first mds hst `` einstein cross '' lens candidate , found in the `` groth - westphal strip '' ( gws ) .",
    "this is the brightest lens system discovered with the hst and it has been confirmed spectroscopically .",

    "the number of strong gravitational lenses as a function of redshift is very sensitive to the value of the cosmological constant @xmath4 ( @xcite ) and could be used as an estimator of the latter quantity if all of the complex detection thresholds which govern completeness are well understood and known quantitatively .",
    "these ten gravitational lenses were discovered serendipitously on wfpc2 images processed via the data analysis pipeline of the hst medium deep survey and were not found as a result of a very systematic or quantitative search . in view of the very large range of data quality amongst the pure parallel mds observations and because of overlapping fields , it is not possible to be precise about the number of fields surveyed and we have deliberately rounded the numbers to reflect the nature of approximate estimates . in the full survey we processed over 500 wfpc2 fields , each covering about 4.77 square arcmin of sky .",
    "overlap between wfpc2 fields is on average about 20% for the mds survey .",
    "all of the gravitational lenses were however discovered on about 130 wfpc2 fields which were designated `` priority one '' for which we had three or more exposures in each of two or more filters .",
    "although only just over 10% of the `` priority one ''",
    "fields had exposures in the three bvi filters , 50% of the lenses discovered , have observations in all three filters .",
    "since the pointings were random , this implies a very strong selection effect in terms of data quality .",
    "clearly we found the `` top ten list '' of lenses in the best data available to the medium deep survey .",
    "two factors distinguish these wfpc2 fields from the rest .",
    "more exposures usually indicated a longer total exposure time and maybe more importantly better cosmic ray rejection .",
    "removal of cosmic rays in single exposures clearly runs the risk of losing the lensed images in the cleaning out of many cosmic rays , and this remains true for stacks with two images which require cleaning out of the non - negligible number of pixels hit by cosmic rays in both images . in figure  11",
    "we show the limiting magnitude for completeness of the object catalog as a function of total integration time , for all wfpc2 images processed through the mds pipeline in the 3 main filters .",
    "the `` priority one '' mds fields are plotted with circles , with filled circles showing those fields on which gravitational lenses were discovered .",
    "it appears that a limiting magnitude fainter than 25.1 mag in f450w , 24.8 in f606w and 24.3 in f814w , requiring total exposure times typically longer than 1 hour , is needed for discovery of a gravitational lens . assuming that limiting magnitude is the only factor , the survey of about 160 wfpc2 fields , less about 20% overlap , leads to an estimate of the total survey area of about 0.17 square degrees .",
    "the actual process of discovery of the lenses included a manual component whereby the most likely candidates of gravitational lensing were picked out during an inspection stage of the mds pipeline or from the residual images after removal of the maximum likelihood scale - free model for the galaxy .",
    "typically the lensed object was much bluer than the lensing galaxy , and is seen better on the f450w or f606w filter rather than f814w which was by default the first filter used for parallel observations of limited total time on each field .",
    "the availability of an image in other filters was useful to ensure that the colors of the lensed images were about the same .",
    "so the fact that all the lenses discovered in the mds are on `` priority one '' fields is probably not coincidental .",
    "if good images in two or more filters ( mds priority one ) was the only factor , then the survey consisted of about 130 wfpc2 fields with an estimated area of about 0.14 square degrees .",
    "if we take both conditions i.e. limiting magnitude and mds `` priority one '' , then we have about 90 fields or about 0.1 square degrees , which is a lower estimate .",
    "an incomplete sample of gravitational lenses can , however , be used to measure @xmath4 if we know or can average over unknown properties of the lensing galaxies such as the mass distribution ( @xcite ) . the expected bias caused by the orientation of mass should be random and could be averaged out . however a selection effect that is caused by internal extinction within the lens galaxy may lead to a systematic bias that does not average out .",
    "when a statistically significant sample of spectroscopically confirmed candidates becomes available , the mds database is an ideal place for the comparison of the properties of the lensing ellipticals and non - lensing ellipticals to see if lenses are found preferentially in low extinction systems .",
    "we have presented a `` top ten list '' of the lens candidates . in most of these cases",
    "the lensed images are well resolved from the lensing galaxy .",
    "most of the candidates were picked while processing the data through the mds pipeline .",
    "the current sample unfortunately suffers the same selection biases as the serendipitously discovered sample of gravitational lenses known at brighter magnitudes . at the expense of having a slightly incomplete sample , the lenses modeled in this paper",
    "are selected to have the highest probability of being good gravitational lens candidates .",
    "if one lowers the standard of acceptance , one can pick out hundreds more possible lens candidates , a small fraction of which may turn out to be gravitational lenses . after removal of the smooth axis - symmetric galaxy model images , the residuals sometimes configure symmetrically into possible gravitational lens candidates .",
    "most of these residual images are probably bright regions of star formation within the very faint spiral arms around the central bulge of a galaxy .",
    "it is thus very unlikely that most of these objects are lenses .",
    "a spectroscopic study of a significant sample of these objects is unfortunately not practical using current ground based observations , and these candidates therefore do not represent a scientifically usable sample .",
    "they have therefore been excluded from the present list .    a case such as this",
    "was recently published by @xcite . in fig  12",
    "we show the region around this galaxy which appears to show an extended face - on spiral arm structure with the bright regions aligned along them .",
    "in addition , the best - fit lens model of the observed image configuration requires the adoption of a complex potential which is significantly misaligned from the light distribution .",
    "although it will remain a candidate until spectroscopic observation is done , we suspect that these images are of star - formation regions , as found in the case reported in @xcite .",
    "gravitational lenses discovered using hst are especially useful because the lens galaxies are at great distances ( typically @xmath15 ) , allowing for an independent and new method for the study of both galaxy evolution and cosmology .",
    "a total of ten good candidates of gravitational lensing have been discovered in the hst medium deep survey ( mds ) and archival primary observations using wfpc2 .",
    "seven are `` strong lens '' candidates which appear to have multiple images of the source .",
    "three are cases where the image of the source galaxy has been significantly distorted into an arc .",
    "we have summarized the data on all ten candidates and described them with simple models assuming singular isothermal potentials .",
