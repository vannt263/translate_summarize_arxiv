    "the dynamics of a spin @xmath1 , or a quantum bit ( qubit ) , coupled to an environment is one of the longest studied models of quantum decoherence .",
    "it finds important applications both in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and in quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "the suppression of the decoherence is one of the goals one usually strives for . in order to achieve it ,",
    "sequences of control pulses are used @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to address dynamical decoupling ( dd ) by control pulses .",
    "either the control is modulated continuously , see for instance ref . , or the control consists of short pulses which can be seen as ( approximately ) instantaneous . in this article , we will focus exclusively on the latter approach which is common in nmr and wide - spread in qip @xcite .",
    "it relies on control pulses to invert the dynamics of the spin .",
    "the spin experiences a rotation of an angle @xmath0 at each pulse .",
    "the choice of the appropriate sequence is essential for an enhancement of the suppression of decoherence . a large variety of sequences has been suggested .",
    "the majority is characterized by periodic pulses @xcite .",
    "the most famous example is the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) sequence @xcite where cycles of two @xmath0 pulses are iterated .",
    "other sequences proposed are non - equidistant such as the concatenated dynamical decoupling ( cdd ) @xcite or the uhrig dynamical decoupling ( udd ) @xcite .",
    "the cdd consists of concatenations of pulse sequences .",
    "it can suppress both transverse relaxation and longitudinal relaxation at the price of a relatively large number of pulses .",
    "if @xmath2 is the largest order in an expansion in the total duration @xmath3 , in which no decoherence occurs , the required number of pulses grows exponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "the udd eliminates only pure dephasing , but in turn it requires only a linearly growing number of pulses .",
    "the concatenation of the udd sequence ( cudd ) allows for the suppression of transverse and longitudinal relaxation again at the price of an exponential growth of the number of pulses , but requiring only the square root of the number of pulses necessary for cdd @xcite .",
    "we point out that all the above sequences are idealized in the sense that they are based on ideal , instantaneous pulses , i.e. , @xmath4 peaks , though the effect of finite pulse durations is being discussed .",
    "furthermore , sequences of realistic pulses have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the finite duration of the pulse is a source of additional errors which can be reduced by designing the shape of the pulses appropriately , see for instance ref .   and references therein . in the present paper , however",
    ", we will concentrate only on sequences of instantaneous @xmath0 pulses .",
    "the udd sequence was discovered first for a spin - boson model @xcite where it was observed that no details of the model entered .",
    "on the basis of numerical evidence and finite order recursion it was conjectured that udd is applicable to any dephasing model @xcite .",
    "this claim was finally proven for arbitrary number of pulses in the total duration @xmath3 of the sequence @xcite . for various classical noise",
    "spectra the experimental verification of the theoretical results was achieved by optical control of the transition in be ions @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the udd sequence outperforms the cpmg sequence and equidistant sequences in general for pure dephasing baths with hard cutoff while it performs worse for soft cutoffs @xcite .",
    "this shows that the knowledge of the cutoff is an essential piece of information for an optimum suppression of decoherence .",
    "the performance of some pulse sequences for classical noise spectra has already been considered by cywiski _",
    "et al .  _ for superconducting qubits subject to gaussian and random telegraph noise @xcite .",
    "the authors compare the efficiency of different sequences in suppressing pure dephasing .",
    "they find that the udd sequence is optimum in suppressing the decoherence if the gaussian noise displays a hard ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff . in situations , however , where one has to work in the regime of small frequencies ( long times ) such that the cutoff can not be reached , the cpmg sequence is the one yielding the best results .",
    "another proposal for an optimized sequence is put forward by biercuk _",
    "et al .  _",
    "the optimization in the udd is extended to a locally optimized dynamical decoupling ( lodd ) sequence which is tailored to a given experimental noise environment .",
    "the experimental implementation of lodd for classical noise shows that it performs better than udd and cpmg .",
    "the lodd , however , is limited by the degree to which the spectral function of the noise ( or the bath ) is known .",
    "this caveat is dealt with by an optimized noise - filtration dynamic decoupling ( ofdd ) @xcite where the noise spectrum is approximated by a constant up to a high - energy ( uv ) cutoff for which sequences of pulses are deduced numerically . for an ohmic bath the ofdd implies about the same factor of @xmath5 of improvement over the udd sequence than the more cumbersome lodd .",
    "but it does not provide a significant improvement for an ambient noise scaling such as @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper we generalize the ofdd from a constant spectrum to an arbitrary power law without uv cutoff .",
    "this problem can be analysed to a large extent analytically .",
    "the resulting * * o**ptimized * * d**ynamic * * d**ecoupling sequences for * * p**ower * * l**aw spectra ( plodd ) are universal in the sense that the relative instants @xmath7 of the pulses depend only on the power law exponent @xmath8 .",
    "the gist of our finding is that the plodd sequences resemble cpmg sequences for slowly decreasing noise spectra while they approach udd sequences for fast decreasing noise spectra .",
    "this agrees with the qualitative expectations based on other investigations @xcite .",
    "our results provide an important guideline in the choice of sequences to be applied in experiments on the suppression of decoherence .    from an experimental point of view ,",
    "the noise used to test the dynamical decoupling sequences - classical noise , ohmic spectrum , as well as the @xmath9 noise spectrum - is in general governed by a power law spectrum .",
    "analytically , power law spectra approximate any spectrum either for very small or for very large frequencies which in turn correspond to long or short durations , respectively .",
    "moreover , power law spectra are the perfect tool to analyze the influence of baths characterized by different cutoffs on the optimized pulse sequence . by varying the exponent of the power law of the spectrum we can simulate both baths with soft and hard cutoffs and we can interpolate smoothly between them .    in order to render an analytical investigation possible we consider the spin - boson model with pure dephasing .",
    "we start from the decoherence function @xmath10 ( defined in eq .  ) which measures the size of the decoherence .",
    "the advantage is that the decoherence function at the same time embodies both the characteristics of the bath and of the sequence of @xmath0 pulses .",
    "hence one has to minimize @xmath10 .",

    "combined with the power law scaling shown in fig .",

    "the sequences are optimized for power law spectra .",
    "the main difference to the already known optimized sequences , for instance udd or ofdd , is that the convergence of the decoherence function @xmath10 is investigated for various powers ( @xmath8 ) of the noise spectrum .",

    "one of the authors generalized this investigation to the quantum mechanical spin - boson model and cutoffs with arbitrary power law behavior @xcite .    in the present work we extended these findings further by the systematic optimization of the sequence on the basis of analytical results for arbitrary power law spectra",
    "the softer the uv behavior of the power law spectrum is , i.e. , the smaller its exponent @xmath8 is , the more the plodd approaches the cpmg .",

    "hence , the findings of previous investigations are corroborated .",
    "there is no completely different sequence which displays a significantly better performance for pure dephasing other than plodd .",
    "the plodd has the limiting cases cpmg ( soft uv behavior ) and udd ( hard uv behavior ) .",
