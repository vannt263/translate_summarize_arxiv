    "two new major astrometric catalogs became available in early 2000 .",
    "the tycho2 catalogue for the brightest 2.5 million stars @xcite , @xcite and the first u.s .",
    "naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog , ucac1 , for 27 million stars on the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "both catalogs are important steps towards the extension of the optical reference frame @xcite beyond densities and magnitudes of the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "the tycho2 catalogue is a new , extended version of the original tycho catalogue @xcite , based on a re  reduction of the esa hipparcos mission tycho data and over 140 ground  based catalogs for the tycho2 proper motions .",
    "an external comparison of the tycho2 _ astrometry _ is presented here utilizing the ucac1 positions .",
    "a similar comparison between the tycho1 catalogue and ccd astrograph test data was earlier @xcite .",
    "the u.s .",
    "naval observatory ccd astrograph ( ucac ) project was planned and initiated in the mid 1990s @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "observations started at the south celestial pole in 1998 and full sky coverage is expected by mid 2003 . for the comparison presented in this paper , these new ,",
    "high precision observations were available for about 80% of the southern hemisphere , covering the magnitude range r@xmath3 .",
    "thus , particularly , the new , faint extension of the tycho2 catalog ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) is very well covered by these independent ground  based observations .",
    "both catalogs are on the hipparcos system , thus the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) .",
    "the epoch difference of about 8 years is bridged by proper motions given in the tycho2 catalog at the expense of introducing a third error contribution besides the positional errors of both catalogs .",
    "the ucac is not a photometric catalog , with only approximate magnitudes given in a single bandpass ( red ) .",
    "therefore _ no _ external _ photometric _ comparison of the tycho2 data can be presented here . both tycho2 and ucac1 are of great importance to the general astronomical community and the astrometric comparison presented here is also of benefit for the tycho2 and in particular the ucac projects . another important catalog comparison between the tycho2 , the and the hipparcos catalogue is in preparation @xcite .",
    "here we briefly describe properties of both catalogs which are relevant for this comparison . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to the papers mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the major improvement of the tycho2 catalogue over the original tycho catalogue is the faint extension , providing positions for some 1.5 million more stars , extending its limiting magnitude to about v=12.5 .",
    "this was made possible by a new reduction procedure which also provides new , slightly improved positions for the stars previously given in tycho1 .",
    "the mean epoch for the tycho observations is in the range of 1990.72 to 1992.36 , depending on the individual star .",
    "the estimated precision of the tycho positions is a function of magnitude , as given in table 1 , adopted from @xcite .",
    "an internal error of a position component for each star in tycho2 is derived from the distribution of the @xmath6 individual observations per star made by the hipparcos satellite . excluding the wings of the distribution , a standard error for the position of each star",
    "is calculated .",
    "the medians of those standard errors per magnitude bin are given in table 1 ( @xmath7 ) , providing a robust estimate of the standard error with outliers rejected .",
    "proper motions have been derived utilizing the tycho2 positions and a large number of ground  based catalogs , including a new reduction of the astrographic catalogue ( ac ) data .",
    "significant changes were made here , particularly in the magnitude dependent systematic error corrections of the ac data as compared to the previous release , the ac2000 @xcite . assuming a mean difference of 7.7 years between the tycho2 and epochs and taking the formal errors of the tycho2 proper motions from @xcite",
    ", we obtain the error contribution due to proper motions , @xmath8 , also given in table 1 .",
    "the ucac astrometric sky survey started in february 1998 at cerro tololo , chile .",
    "in this first , preliminary catalog , data are included up to november 1999 , thus the mean epoch of the catalog is about 1999.0 .",
    "the ucac survey is performed in a single bandpass ( 579 - 642 nm ) with a 2-fold overlap pattern of fields , with a long and a short exposure on each field .",
    "the 5element lens astrograph of 206 mm aperture uses a single 4k by 4k ccd detector , providing a 61@xmath9 field of view with a scale of 0.9\" / pixel .",
    "stars in the range of 10 to 14th magnitude are the most precise with an estimated positional error of @xmath1020 mas .",
    "brighter stars are overexposed on the long exposures , hence only the short exposures generally contribute to positions of stars around magnitude 8 to 9.5 .",
    "brighter than @xmath11 are also saturated on most short exposures . for faint , the precision degrades to about 70 mas at the limiting magnitude of r@xmath1016 .",
    "a first catalog ( ucac1 ) for 27 million stars @xcite was released by the end of march 2000 , see also http://ad.usno.navy.mil/. preliminary proper motions are included for all stars in .",
    "those proper motions have not been used here at all . for the magnitude range overlapping with the tycho2 data ,",
    "the ucac1 proper motions are mainly derived from ac and tycho2 data , thus are highly correlated with the tycho2 proper motions . for this catalog comparison",
    "the tycho2 proper motions were used to update the tycho2 positions to the ucac epoch of each individual star in common .",
    "the ucac1 was reduced using hipparcos , tycho1 and act data , thus mainly depends on the original tycho1 catalogue stars plus the proper motions derived from the ac2000 reductions . in particular , all new , faint stars in tycho2 which are not in tycho1 are field stars in ucac1 , thus were not used as reference stars",
    ". therefore ucac1 positions of those stars are largely independent of tycho2 positions . both tycho2 and ucac1 are in the same system ( hipparcos ) , except for a possible , slight alteration by the use of act proper motions .",
    "all ccd frames of the ucac1 data were reduced individually using the astrometrically suitable reference stars on each frame with a linear 6parameter mapping model . the low charge  transfer efficiency ( cte ) of our ccd results in significant coma  like systematic errors along the x  coordinate ( right ascension ) .",
    "the effect in the raw data is up to @xmath1270 mas .",
    "these errors have been corrected to first order .",
    "remaining systematic errors are believed to be on the 10 mas level .",
    "the remaining residuals versus coma are @xmath13 10 mas for most part in both axis .",
    "there is an asymmetric feature of up to 20 mas in the x ",
    "coordinate for a small fraction of the stars .",
    "these plots and more details can be found in the ucac1 paper @xcite .",
    "a magnitude equation was already noticed in the residuals of the ccd frame reductions , mainly for the x  coordinate .",
    "however , for this first catalog neither corrections for a magnitude term were applied nor were such terms included in the reduction model . at this point",
    "it is not obvious if the magnitude dependent systematic errors are inherent in the ucac @xmath14data or introduced by the act via proper motions .",
    "future ucac astrometric reductions will use the tycho2 catalogue , which was not available at the time of ucac1 reductions .",
    "weighted mean catalog positions were obtained from the individual positions .",
    "precisions of the mean positions are obtained from the scatter of the few ( @xmath15 ) individual observations per .",
    "the ( squared ) mean of these individual sigmas over stars in a magnitude bin is an estimate of the standard error of the positional precision of the catalog and is given in table 1 as @xmath16 .",
    "this @xmath16 is slightly underestimated due to the correlations of the individual field star positions from the short and long exposure frames , which use a significant number of reference stars in common for their reductions .",
    "the precision of the ucac1 positions is also a function of magnitude .",
    "for magnitudes @xmath1711 , the precision of ucac1 positions is underestimated due to the correlation with the reference stars . for the data",
    "the @xmath18 red magnitude has to be used . on average ,",
    "the color index is @xmath19 , thus the precisions in position given in table 1 for both catalogs are for about the same stars on each line .",
    "the last column in table 1 gives the expected combined standard error of ( tycho2 @xmath20 ucac1 ) position differences as derived from internal , formal errors only .",
    "in total , close to 1.0 million stars have been found in common between the tycho2 catalogue and ucac1 , adopting a match radius of 500 mas . excluding the tycho1 stars ( reference stars of ) and adopting the same match radius we find 597,809 stars in common",
    ".      position differences ( tycho2 @xmath20 ucac1 ) , at the ucac1 epoch , are plotted versus tycho v magnitude in figure 1 . all stars in common",
    "are shown here .",
    "using only the stars not included in tycho1 gives just the faint part of the plots shown in figure 1 .",
    "one dot represents the mean of 2000 stars .",
    "a magnitude equation is clearly present , with systematic differences up to @xmath21 mas over the range of @xmath105 magnitudes .",
    "while the magnitude equation for the right ascension component ( x ) is almost linear , it is non  linear for the declination component ( y ) .",
    "the systematic errors as a function of magnitude vary with declination as can be seen in figure 2 . here",
    "the ( tycho2 @xmath20 ucac1 ) position are plotted versus declination .",
    "the general offset is due to the fact that the majority of stars ( faint end ) have a non  zero position difference due to the magnitude equation .",
    "the variation of this offset and thus the magnitude equation follows a zonal pattern in declination .",
    "a plot of the differences vs.  right ascension shows no pattern .",
    "there are also no additional significant systematic errors of the position differences with respect to color .",
    "figure 3 shows plots for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 components vs.  @xmath24 tycho color index .      in the following statistics ,",
    "only the stars are used .",
    "table 2 summarizes the results by magnitude bins , with all position items given in units of mas .",
    "the listed @xmath25 magnitude is for the center of each bin , while @xmath26 gives the number of stars available per magnitude bin .",
    "the standard deviations given in table 2 are obtained from    @xmath27    and similarly for the @xmath28coordinate , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the individual ( tycho2 @xmath20 ucac1 ) position differences and @xmath31 are their arithmetic means for that magnitude bin . in order to exclude outliers , two approaches were made .",
    "first the @xmath32 values were sorted and the largest 10% were rejected .",
    "the resulting standard errors from this cut of the distribution are given in table 2 in the @xmath33 columns .",
    "the second method used the 25 to 75 percentile of the distribution of the position differences around their mean . assuming the central parts of our position differences distributions to be gaussian , @xmath34 values were derived ( see table 2 ) . for easy comparison , the last column of table 2 gives the _ expected _ combined standard error for our position differences , from the formal errors alone , which has been copied from table 1 .",
    "a comparison with the yale southern proper motion ( spm ) data @xcite shows that the apparently linear magnitude equation in for the right ascension component does not extend to fainter magnitudes .",
    "results are presented in @xcite , indicating good agreement between ucac1 and spm positions around 15th magnitude for both coordinates . the systematic pattern as a _ function of declination _",
    "can best be understood to originate from the proper motion part in this comparison .",
    "individual zones in the ac might be responsible for this signature . a plausible magnitude dependent error of @xmath10100 mas at a 1900",
    "ac epoch would lead to an error in the act proper motions consistend with a 10 mas offset seen in our comparison at the 1999 ucac1 epoch .",
    "the overall offset in figure 2 results from an average slope in the magnitude equation and the fact that the mean magnitude of the stars in comparison here is fainter than the mean magnitude of the reference stars used in the ucac1 reductions .",
    "mean _ magnitude equation at the 8 to 12 mag range is possible to come from the ucac @xmath14data .",
    "many images of those stars are close to the pixel saturation level , within a factor of @xmath103 in the amplitude counts in either the long or short exposure .",
    "it is also conceivable , that remaining systematic errors associated with the cte effect show up as pure magnitude terms .",
    "a systematic error in the tycho2 data of @xmath10 5 to 10 mas at the faint end can not be excluded from this comparison either .",
    "however this is unlikely based on studies made in the tycho2 construction ( comparison with hipparcos )",
    ". future reductions of the ucac data will help to clarify this issue .",
    "there are 5 contributions to the observed scatter in the position differences : random errors in both the tycho2 and ucac1 positions at their mean epochs , random errors in the proper motions needed to bridge the epoch difference between the catalogs , additional noise from incompatibilities and systematic differences .",
    "the additional noise from incompatibilities includes items like unknown multiplicity of stars , which shifts the center of light as a function of time and bandpass .",
    "it is conceivable that a relatively small number of multiple stars can bias the statistics significantly , particularly in the highest precision area around 10th magnitude .",
    "unresolved components on the few 100 mas level are likely to cause offsets in the photocenters on the 10 to 100 mas level , introducing a significant additional error . neither the cut of the observed distribution ( @xmath33 ) nor the 50% quantile standard errors are likely to eliminate those problem stars from the statistics .",
    "also , positional shifts by differential refraction are not taken into account in the ucac data .",
    "individual stars , depending on their color and zenith distance at the time of observation , will have different offsets w.r.t .",
    "the mean of the reference stars , contrary to the tycho2 data which are collected outside the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the difference in position between an o5 and an m5 main sequence star due to differenctial color refrection is about 10 mas for the ucac bandpass and a zenit distance of 45@xmath35 .",
    "thus there are physical reasons to expect a noise term in the observed scatter of the position differences in addition to the 3 internal errors ( catalog 1 , catalog 2 , proper motions ) , even in the absence of significant systematic errors .    for magnitudes v@xmath139.0",
    "the statistics are affected by the small number of available stars .",
    "overall the observed scatter in the position differences very well with the expected , formal , errors at those magnitudes .",
    "in general the x  coordinate ( right ascension ) shows a significantly larger error than the y  coordinate .",
    "this very likely shows still unresolved systematic errors in the ucac data due to the cte problems along the x  axis .",
    "the largest discrepancies ( typical 40 to 50% underestimation of errors ) between observed and expected standard errors are seen in the mid range of fainter than 9th and brighter than 11th magnitude .",
    "this is the transition area between positions based on short exposures only and the combination of short and long exposures .",
    "also , in this magnitude range the combined formal error is lowest , allowing a moderate additional contribution from systematic errors to show up most pronounced .    at the faint end ( v@xmath3611.0 )",
    "the excess of the observed scatter w.r.t .",
    "the formal errors is relatively small ; insignificant to @xmath1010% when compared with the @xmath33 ( cut distribution ) , and about 20% when compared to the @xmath34 numbers .",
    "this gives an external verification of the accuracy of the tycho2 astrometry and sets an upper limit to the ratio of true / formal errors to about 1.2 at the faint end of the catalog , which includes the majority of the stars . at those magnitudes the ucac1 positions , even if underestimated by their formal errors , are more accurate than the tycho2 positions .",
    "the high ucac1 accuracy is also confirmed by a comparison with spm data @xcite .",
    "the tycho2 and ucac1 positions overall are in good agreement with systematic differences being very small by current astrometric catalog .",
    "this external comparison shows the observed scatter in the position differences to be 10 to 50% larger than the formal , internal precisions predict .",
    "a significant fraction of the additional errors can be explained by systematic errors present in the current ucac1 , which by all means is a preliminary catalog .",
    "the ucac1 contains the best positions available today ( at current epochs ) for stars in the 11 to 16 magnitude range .",
    "ucac today covers only 80% of the southern hemisphere with no data in the north .",
    "when completed in 2003 it will form the basis for the fame @xcite input catalog .",
    "the tycho2 catalogue covers all sky and is the preferred astrometric reference down to about magnitude v=10.5 or wherever no ucac1 data are available .",
