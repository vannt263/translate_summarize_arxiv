    "submillimeter size optical microspheres made of fused silica with whispering gallery modes ( wgm)@xcite can have extremely high quality - factor , up to @xmath0 that makes them promising devices for applications in optoelectronics and experimental physics .",
    "historically richtmyer@xcite was the first to suggest that whispering gallery modes in axisymmetric dielectric body should have very high quality - factor .",
    "he examined the cases of sphere and torus .",
    "however only recent breakthroughs in technology in several labs allowed producing not only spherical and not only fused silica but spheroidal , toroidal @xcite or even arbitrary form axisymmetrical optical microcavities from crystalline materials preserving or even increasing high quality factor @xcite .",
    "especially interesting are devices manufactured of nonlinear optical crystals .",
    "microresonators of this type can be used as high - finesse cavities for laser stabilization , as frequency discriminators and high - sensitive displacement sensors , as sensors of ambient medium and in optoelectronical rf high - stable oscillators .",
    "( see for example materials of the special leos workshop on wgm microresonators @xcite ) .",
    "the theory of wgms in microspheres is well established and allows precise calculation of eigenmodes , radiative losses and field distribution both analytically and numerically .",
    "unfortunately , the situation changes drastically even in the case of simplest axisymmetrical geometry , different from ideal sphere or cylinder .",
    "no closed analytical solution can be found in this case .",
    "direct numerical methods like finite elements method are also inefficient when the size of a cavity is several orders larger than the wavelength .",
    "the theory of quasiclassical methods of eigenfrequencies approximation starting from pioneering paper by keller and rubinow have made a great progress lately @xcite .",
    "for the practical evaluation of precision that these methods can in principal provide , we chose a practical problem of calculation of eigenfrequencies in dielectric spheroid and found a series over angular mode number @xmath1 .",
    "this choice of geometry is convenient due to several reasons : 1 ) other shapes , for example toroids @xcite may be approximated by equivalent spheroids ; 2 ) the eikonal equation as well as scalar helmholtz equation ( but not the vector one ! ) is separable in spheroidal coordinates that gives additional flexibility in understanding quasiclassical methods and comparing them with other approximations ; 3 ) in the limit of zero eccentricity spheroid turns to sphere for which exact solution and series over @xmath1 up to @xmath2 is known @xcite .",
    "the helmholtz vector equation is unseparable @xcite in spheroidal coordinates and no vector harmonics tangential to the surface of spheroid can be build .",
    "that is why there are no pure te or tm modes in spheroids but only hybrid ones .",
    "different methods of separation of variables ( svm ) using series expansions with either spheroidal or spherical functions have been proposed @xcite .",
    "unfortunately they lead to extremely bulky infinite sets of equations which can be solved numerically only in simplest cases and the convergence is not proved .",
    "exact characteristic equation for the eigenfrequencies in dielectric spheroid was suggested@xcite without provement that if real could significantly ease the task of finding eigenfrequencies .",
    "however , we can not confirm this claim as this characteristic equation contradicts limiting cases with the known solutions i.e. ideal sphere and axisymmetrical oscillations in a spheroid with perfectly conducting walls @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in case of whispering gallery modes adjacent to equatorial plane the energy is mostly concentrated in tangential or normal to the surface electric components that can be treated as quasi - te or quasi - tm modes and analyzed with good approximation using scalar wave equations .    using quasiclassical method we deduce below the following practical approximation for the eigenfrequencies of whispering gallery modes in spheroid : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are equatorial and polar semiaxises",
    ", @xmath6 is the wavenumber , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ... and @xmath9 ... are integer mode indices , @xmath10 are the @xmath11-th roots of the equation @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the airy function ) , @xmath14 is refraction index of a spheroid and @xmath15 for quasi - te and @xmath16 for quasi - tm modes .",
    "there are several equivalent ways to introduce prolate and oblate spheroidal coordinates and corresponding eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "the following widely used system of coordinates allows to analyze prolate and oblate geometries simultaneously : @xmath17^{1/2}\\cos(\\phi ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & y=\\frac{d}{2}[(\\xi^2-s)(1-\\eta^2)]^{1/2}\\sin(\\phi)\\nonumber\\\\ & & z=\\frac{d}{2}\\xi\\eta , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced a sign variable @xmath18 which is equal to 1 for the prolate geometry with @xmath19 determining spheroids and @xmath20 $ ] describing two - sheeted hyperboloids of revolution ( fig.1 , right ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath21 gives oblate spheroids for @xmath22 and one - sheeted hyperboloids of revolution ( fig.1 , right ) .",
    "@xmath23 is the semidistance between focal points .",
    "we are interested in the modes inside a spheroid adjacent to its surface in the equatorial plane .",
    "it is convenient to designate a semiaxis in this plane as @xmath4 and in the @xmath24-axis of rotational symmetry of the body as @xmath5 . in this case",
    "@xmath25 and eccentricity @xmath26 .",
    "the scalar helmholtz differential equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is separable .",
    "the solution is @xmath29 where radial and angular functions are determined by the following equations : @xmath30 @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the separation constant of the equations which should be independently determined and it is a function on @xmath33 , @xmath1 and @xmath34 . with substitution",
    "@xmath35 the first equation transforms to the equation for the spherical bessel function @xmath36 if @xmath37 in which case",
    "the second equation immediately turns to the equation for the associated legendre polynomials @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "that is why spheroidal functions are frequently analyzed as decomposition over these spherical functions .",
    "the calculation of spheroidal functions and of @xmath32 is not a trivial task @xcite .",
    "the approximation of spheroidal functions and their zeros may seem more straightforward for the calculation of eigenfrequencies of spheroids , however we found that another approach that we develop below gives better results and may be easily generalized to other geometries .",
    "the eikonal approximation is a powerful method for solving optical problems in inhomogeneous media where the scale of the variations is much larger than the wavelength .",
    "it was shown by keller and rubinow @xcite that it can also be applied to eigenfrequency problems and that it has very clear quasiclassical ray interpretation .",
    "it is important that this quasiclassical ray interpretation requiring simple calculation of the ray paths along the geodesic surfaces and application of phase equality ( quantum ) conditions gives precisely the same equations as the eikonal equations .",
    "eikonal equations allow , however , to obtain more easily not only eigenfrequencies but field distribution also .    in the eikonal approximation",
    "the solution of the helmholtz scalar equation is found as a superposition of straight rays : @xmath40 the first order approximation for the phase function @xmath41 called eikonal is determined by the following equation . @xmath42 where @xmath43 is optical susceptibility . for our problem of searching for eigenfrequencies",
    "@xmath43 does not depend on coordinates , @xmath44 inside the cavity and @xmath45  outside . though the eikonal can be found as complex rays in the external area and stitched on the boundary as well as ray method of keller and rubinow @xcite can be extended for whispering gallery modes in dielectrical bodies in a more simple way @xcite .",
    "to do so we must account for an additional phase shift on the dielectric boundary . fresnel amplitude coefficient of reflection @xcite : @xmath46 gives the following approximations for the phase shift for grazing angles : @xmath47 nevertheless , direct use of this phase shift in the equations for internal rays as suggested in @xcite leads to incorrect results .",
    "the reason is a well known goos - hnchen effect  the shift of the reflected beam along the surface .",
    "the beams behave as if they are reflected from a fixious surface hold away from the real boundary at @xmath48 .",
    "that is why we may substitute the problem for a dielectric body with the problem for an equivalent body enlarged on @xmath49 with the totally reflecting boundaries .",
    "the parameters of equivalent spheroid are marked below with overbars .",
    "the eikonal equation separates in spheroidal coordinates if we choose @xmath50 : @xmath51 after immediate separation of @xmath52 we have : @xmath53 introducing another separation constant @xmath54 we finally obtain solutions : @xmath55 which after some manipulations transform to : @xmath56 where @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "it is now the time to turn to the quasiclassical ray interpretation @xcite of whispering gallery modes .",
    "the eikonal equation describes rays spreading inside a cavity along straight lines and reflecting from boundaries . for the whispering gallery modes the angle of reflection is close to @xmath60 .",
    "the envelope of these rays forms a caustic surface which in case of spheroid is also a spheroid determined by a parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the rays are the tangents to this internal caustic spheroid and follow along eodesic lines on it . in case of ideal sphere all the rays of the same family lie in the same plane .",
    "however , even a slightest eccentricity removes this degeneracy and inclined closed circular modes which should be more accurately called quasimodes @xcite are turned into open - ended helices winding up on caustic spheroid precessing @xcite , and filling up the whole region as in a clew .",
    "the upper and lower points of these trajectories determine another caustic surface with a parameter @xmath62 determining two - sheeted hyperboloid for prolate or one - sheeted hyperboloid for oblate spheroid .",
    "the value of @xmath62 has very simple mechanical interpretation .",
    "the rays in the eikonal approximation are equivalent to the trajectories of a point - like billiard ball inside the cavity .",
    "as axisymmetrical surface can not change the angular momentum related to the @xmath24 axis , it should be conserved on the ray ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) as well as the kinetic energy ( velocity ) .",
    "that is why @xmath62 is simply equal to the sine of the angle between the equatorial plane and the trajectory crossing the equator and at the same time it determines the maximum elongation of the trajectory from the equator plane .",
    "together with the simple law of reflection on the boundaries ( angle of reflectance is equal to the angle of incidence i.e normal component is reversed at reflection @xcite @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the outward normal to the surface unit vector .",
    "the so - called billiard theory in 2d and 3d is extremely popular these days in deterministic chaos studies .",
    "this theory describes for example ray dynamics and kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) transition to chaos in 2d deformed stadium - like optical cavities and in 3d strongly deformed droplets @xcite . in this paper",
    ", however , we are interested only in stable whispering gallery modes which are close to the surface and equatorial plane of axisymmetric convex bodies .",
    "axisymmetric 3d billiard is equivalent to 2d billiard in ( @xmath67 , @xmath24 ) coordinates . in these coordinates 3d linear rays transform into parabolas and a ball behaves as if centrifugal force acts on it@xcite .",
    "fig 2 shows how segments of geometric rays ( turned into segments of parabolas ) fill the volume between caustic lines in a spheroid with @xmath68 .",
    "if all the rays touch the caustic or boundary surface with phases that form stationary distribution ( that means that the phase difference along any closed curve on them is equal to integer times @xmath69 ) , then the eigenfunction and hence eigenfrequency is found .    to find the circular integrals of phases @xmath70 ( [ eikonal ] ) we should take into account the properties of phase evolutions on caustic and reflective boundary .",
    "every touching of caustic adds @xmath60 ( see for example @xcite ) and reflection adds @xmath71 .",
    "thus for @xmath72 we have one caustic shift of @xmath60 at @xmath61 and one reflection from the equivalent boundary surface @xmath73 ( at the distance @xmath74 from the real surface ) , for @xmath75  two times @xmath60 due to caustic shifts at @xmath76 , and we should add nothing for @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79  is the order of the mode , showing the number of the zero of the radial function on the surface , and @xmath80 .",
    "these conditions plus integrals ( [ eikonal ] ) completely coincide with those obtained by bykov @xcite if we transform ellipsoidal to spheroidal coordinates , and have clear geometrical interpretation .",
    "the integral for @xmath72 corresponds to the difference in lengths of the two geodesic curves on @xmath62 between two points @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the first one goes from the caustic circle of intersection between @xmath61 and @xmath62 along @xmath62 to the boundary surface @xmath73 , reflects from it , and returns back to the same circle .",
    "the second is simply the arc of the circle between @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the integral for @xmath75 corresponds to the length of a geodesic line going from @xmath83 along @xmath61 , lowering to @xmath85 and returning to @xmath62 at @xmath84 minus the length of the arc of the circle between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the third integral is simply the length of the circle of intersection of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these are elliptic integrals . for the whispering gallery modes when",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath75 may be expanded into series over @xmath62 and @xmath88 and integrated with the substitutions of @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "finally , expressing spheroidal coordinates @xmath61 and expressing @xmath91 through parameters of spheroid , we have : @xmath92+o(\\zeta^{7/2},\\eta_c^2\\zeta^{5/2},\\eta_c^4\\zeta^{3/2})\\nonumber\\\\ s_2&=&\\frac{nd}{2}\\eta^2_c\\int\\frac{\\cos^2\\psi\\sqrt{\\xi_c^2-s\\eta_c^2\\sin^2\\psi}}{1-\\eta_c^2\\sin^2\\psi}d\\psi = \\frac{nd}{2}\\eta^2_c\\xi_c\\left[\\frac{2\\psi+\\sin 2\\psi}{4}+ \\frac{(2\\xi_c^2-s)(4\\psi-\\sin4\\psi)}{64\\xi_c^2}\\eta^2_c \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\frac{(8\\xi_c^4 - 4f\\xi_c^2 - 1)(12\\psi+\\sin6\\psi-3\\sin4\\psi-3\\sin2\\psi)}{1536\\xi_c^4}\\eta^4_c + o(\\eta^6_c ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ s_3&=&\\mu\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we should solve the following system of equations : @xmath93 using the method of sequential iterations , starting for example from @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 this system may be resolved : @xmath97+o(l^{-2})\\nonumber\\\\ \\zeta_0&=&\\frac{\\beta_q a^2}{b^2}\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{-2/3}\\left[1+\\frac{\\beta_q(5a^2 - 3b^2)}{5b^2}\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{-2/3}\\right]+o(l^{-5/3})\\nonumber\\\\ nk a & = & nk(\\bar a-\\sigma_r)=l+\\beta_q\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{1/3}+\\frac{2p(a - b)+a}{2b }   -\\frac{\\chi n}{\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}+\\frac{3\\beta_q^2}{20}\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{-1/3 } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\beta_q}{12}\\left(\\frac{2p(a^3-b^3)+a^3}{b^3}+\\frac{2n^3\\chi(2\\chi^2 - 3)}{(n^2 - 1)^{3/2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{-2/3 } + o(l^{-1 } ) \\label{eikres},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for the convenience of comparison we introduced @xmath98^{2/3}$ ] . the value of @xmath99 needed for the calculation of @xmath100 ( [ goos ] ) one may estimate as @xmath101 .",
    "the first three terms for @xmath102 were obtained in @xcite from different considerations , the last three are new .    to test this series",
    "we calculated using finite element method ( fem ) eigenfrequencies of te modes in spheroids with different eccentricities with totally reflecting boundaries for @xmath103 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "significant improvement of our series is evident .",
    "the divergence of the series for large eccenricities is explained by the fact that the approximation that we used to calculate the integrals ( [ integrals ] ) but not the method itself breaks down in this case .",
    "namely @xmath62 becomes comparable to @xmath104 and should not be treated as a small parameter .",
    "mode.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ] +    if we put @xmath105 , then all six terms in the obtained series coincide with that obtained in @xcite from exact solution in sphere with a difference that airy function zeros @xmath106 stand in schiller s series instead of approximate @xmath107 values ( @xmath108 0.017 ; 0.0061 ; 0.0033 , ... ) .",
    "the reason is that the eikonal approximation breaks down on caustic , where its more accurate extension with airy functions is finite @xcite . to make our solution even better we may just formally use @xmath10 instead of @xmath107 , hence obtaining final formula ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "the eikonal equation for the sphere may be solved explicitly and the expansion of the solution shows that quasiclassical approximation breaks down on a term @xmath109 , and of the same order should be the error introduced by substitution of vector equations by a scalar ones .",
    "we may now calculate the dependence of mode separation on three indices with up to @xmath110 precision : @xmath111\\\\ & & \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\frac{\\partial\\,\\omega}{\\partial m}\\simeq l^{-1}\\frac{b - a}{b}\\left[1-\\frac{\\alpha_q}{12}\\frac{(b - a)(a+2b)}{b^2}\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{-2/3}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\frac{\\partial\\,\\omega}{\\partial q}\\simeq \\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_q } } \\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{-2/3}\\left[1-\\frac{\\alpha_q}{20}\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^{-2/3}\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that when @xmath112 ( oblate spheroid with the eccentricity @xmath113 , the eigenfrequency separation in the first order of approximation between modes with the same @xmath1 becomes equal to the separation between modes with different @xmath1 and the same @xmath114 ( free spectral range ) .",
    "the difference appears only in the term proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "this situation is close to the case that was experimentally observed in @xcite .",
    "this new degeneracy has simple quasigeometrical interpretation  like in case of a sphere geodesic lines inclined to the equator plane on such spheroid are closed curves returning at the same point of the equator after the whole revolution , crossing , however , the equator not twice as big circles on a sphere but four times .",
    "to find eigenfrequencies of whispering gallery modes in arbitrary body of revolution one may use directly the results of the previous section by fitting the shape of the body in convex equatorial area by equivalent spheroid .",
    "in fact the body should be convex only in the vicinity of wg mode itself .",
    "for example a torus with a width @xmath116 and a height @xmath117 may be approximated by a spheroid with @xmath118 and @xmath119 . nevertheless , more rigorous approach may be developed .",
    "the first step is to find families of caustic surfaces .",
    "this is not a trivial task in general nonintegrable case .",
    "the following approximation may be used to find the first family of caustic surfaces @xcite which are the place of biinvolute curves for characteristic for a chosen wgm mode geodesic lines on the surface : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the normal distance from a point @xmath18 on the surface of the body to a caustic surface , @xmath122 is a parameter of a family , and @xmath123 is the radius of curvature of the geodesic line ( curvature of the surface in the direction of the beam ) and @xmath99 is angle of incidence of the beam in the point @xmath18 .",
    "if we found a caustic surface from the first family , parametrized as @xmath124 then we can find also the second family parametrized as @xmath125 orthogonal to any surface of the first family with different @xmath122 .    a geodesic line for the surface is given by the following integral : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the radius of caustic circle at maximum distance from equatorial plane .",
    "the length of geodesic line : @xmath128    the length of geodesic line , connecting points @xmath129 and @xmath130 : @xmath131 the length of arc from @xmath132 to @xmath133 is equal to @xmath134 . @xmath135 finally : @xmath136    in analogous way for another geodesic line on a caustic surface from the other family @xmath137 we have @xmath138 the third condition is : @xmath139    with the substitution @xmath140 , @xmath141 in ( [ geod1 ] ) , and @xmath142 , @xmath143 in ( [ geod2 ] ) we again obtain expressions for spheroid obtained before ( [ eikonal],[integrals ] ) .",
    "as it was shown above , wgms in axially symmetric bodies , parametrizes as @xmath144 are efficiently described by optical beam traveling close to surface geodesic line and suffering multiple reflections from a curved surface .",
    "if we want to calculate q - factor of whispering gallery mode associated with surface reflection using quasiclassical approach we should take into account losses added at every reflection .",
    "the quality factor is determined by the following simple equation @xcite : @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes losses per unit path length .",
    "if the path is comprised of segments of polyline , then the length of each segment is @xmath147 , where @xmath123 is the radius of curvature of the geodesic line on the surface .",
    "let power losses due to reflection in this segment is equal to @xmath148 and hence @xmath149 . to account for total losses we should average @xmath150 over one coil of geodesic line and",
    "hence we finally obtain : @xmath151^{-1}= \\frac{2\\pi",
    "n l_g}{\\lambda } \\left[\\int_{-z_m}^{z_m}\\frac{t(\\theta)}{r_k(\\theta)\\cos\\theta}\\frac{dl}{dz}dz\\right]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this very useful expression can be used to calculate q - factors in arbitrary shaped whispering gallery resonators associated not only with radiative but also with surface scattering and absorption .",
    "the required coefficient @xmath148 may be deduced from the solution of model problem in a sphere , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are constants : @xmath154 radiative losses per single reflection may be also calculated using quasiclassical arguments @xcite .",
    "if a beam of light is internally reflected from a curved dielectric surface with radius of curvature @xmath123 , then in the external region evanescent field exponentially decays as @xmath155 , here @xmath156 is normal distance from the surface , however at a distance @xmath157 tangential phase velocity reaches speed of light and the tail of evanescent field is radiated .",
    "these speculations allow to obtain quasiclassical estimate : @xmath158\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above equations one can calculate the q - factor knowing @xmath148 and using the following expressions : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a distance from the z - axis of the highest point of geodesic line , @xmath161 is the normal distance between surface and caustic surface .    for radiative losses , however , only @xmath148 having exponential term essentially variates along the geodesic line with @xmath99 maximal and @xmath162 minimal at @xmath163 for oblate geometry and vice versa for prolate one .",
    "now we can calculate the radiative quality factor of wgms in a spheroid .",
    "@xmath164    using substitution @xmath165 we obtain : @xmath166^{-1}\\simeq \\frac{l\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{2\\chi n } e^{2\\psi_0}\\frac{e^{\\psi_1}}{i_0(\\psi_1)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi_0&=&nka\\left[1-\\frac{(2p+1)a(a^2-b^2)}{lb^3}\\right]\\left[{\\rm arccosh}(n)\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha_q}{2}\\right(\\frac{l}{2}\\left)^{-2/3}\\right)-\\sqrt{1 - 1/n^2}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi_1&=&\\psi_0\\frac{3(2p+1)a(a^2-b^2)}{2b^3 l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in conclusion .",
    "we have analyzed quasiclassical method of calculation of eigenfrequencies and quality factors in dielectrica cavities and found that for spheroid they give rather precise results .",
