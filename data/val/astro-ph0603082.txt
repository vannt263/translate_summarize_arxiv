    "after decades of theoretical and observational studies of cool giant and supergiant stars , the mechanisms by which the wind acceleration occurs are still poorly understood .",
    "compared to the sun , these stars are known to present continuous mass loss process occuring at high rates , typically @xmath0",
    "m@xmath1  yr@xmath2 , but in low velocity winds ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath2 ) ( dupree 1986 , lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "radiative pressure on grains transfers momentum to these particles being responsible for their acceleration and , if gas and dust are dynamically well coupled , grains drag the gas outwards resulting in the mass ejection .",
    "however , for stationary envelopes ( @xmath4 pre - agb phase ) dust driven theoretical models have lately failed in reproducing the wind properties , mainly because the dust - gas coupling is not effective ( sandin & hofner 2003 ) .",
    "observationally , guandalini @xmath5 @xmath6 ( 2005 ) found no strong correlation between the mass loss rates and the luminosities of agb stars .",
    "their main conclusion is that , if radiative pressure is important in powering these stellar winds , it must occur in addition to other mechanism .",
    "another drawback to the radiation pressure models is the need for the dust formation region to be close to the star .",
    "recent high resolution doppler measurements show that winds are mainly accelerated near the stellar surface ( @xmath7 ) ( airapetian , carpenter & ofman 2003 ) , while grains are expected to grow and survive at even larger distances .    in this sense",
    ", another mechanism must be used to accelerate the gas near surface .",
    "the most promising mechanism for the winds of cool stars is the transference of momentum and energy to the wind from mhd waves .",
    "hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) showed that it would be possible to reproduce the observed low wind velocities and the high mass loss rates of the cool giant and supergiant stars if some kind of wave damping mechanism is effective at the wind basis ( @xmath8 r@xmath9 ) .",
    "jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989 ) studied the effects of different damping mechanisms and magnetic field divergence and they showed that the magnetic field divergent geometry can rapidly dilute the wave flux and also slow down the wind . their magnetic field geometry was based on empirical relations found from observations of the solar wind .",
    "this because in general , in lack of direct measurements of the magnetic field fluctuations and structure in other stars , we have to simply extrapolate our knowledge from solar observations .    in this work ,",
    "we model the acceleration and heating of a late - type supergiant stellar wind considering an outwarded flux of alfvn waves .",
    "we solve the mhd equations to , self - consistently , determine the magnetic field geometry and the wind temperature and velocity profiles . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model basic equations . in section 3",
    "we present the results and the discussions , followed , by the work conclusions .",
    "the basic wind equations are based on mass , momentum , energy and magnetic flux conservation .",
    "the first is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the flow velocity , @xmath12 is the gas density and @xmath13 is the flow cross - section area at a distance @xmath14 from the center of the star .",
    "the index ",
    "@xmath15 \" indicates the variable is being evaluated at the stellar surface .    assuming a steady flow , the momentum equation can be written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the thermal pressure , @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 is the gas temperature",
    ", @xmath20 is the mean mass per particle , @xmath21 the gravitational constant and @xmath22 the wave magnetic field amplitude . in equation ( [ momentum ] ) , the right hand side contains the gravitational force density and the thermal and wave pressure gradients , respectively .",
    "the last term represent the magnetic force . the wave amplitude ( @xmath22 ) is related to the wave energy density ( @xmath23 ) by @xmath24 .      typically ,",
    "considering magnetic field strengths @xmath25 g , the wind basis is characterized by the relation @xmath26 , @xmath27 the plasma is magnetically dominated . in this case , if we assume the wind to be initiated at funnels anchored at the stellar surface , which are surrounded by a plasma with lower magnetic field strength , the magnetic pressure inside will push the gas and the funnel field lines will expand .",
    "the funnel cross - section radius ( @xmath28 ) will grow super - radially up to a limit value ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this limiting cross - section radius depends both on the relation between external and internal magnetic field strengths and on the filling factor ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "as the area increases , the internal magnetic strength diminishes until the equilibrium between internal and external magnetic pressures is reached . if the internal magnetic field strength is much larger than the external , the flux tubes cross - section will depend on the filling factor only .",
    "the filling factor is the ratio between the area of the stellar surface covered by funnels and the total area .",
    "the averaged maximum area that a funnel could reach would be @xmath31 or , in terms of the cross - section radius : @xmath32 .",
    "for the quiet sun , the funnels that merge to form the coronal holes cover about 10% of the total surface .    in this work , at the wind basis ,",
    "we assume the plasma to be magnetically dominated and the left hand side of equation ( [ momentum ] ) may be neglected if compared to the other terms .",
    "then , by using @xmath33 and a power series expansion method proposed by pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) , we can determine self - consistently the magnetic field geometry without assuming any empirical function for the funnel cross - section with distance .",
    "following pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) , using the thin fluxtube approximation , equation ( [ momentum ] ) and @xmath33 are described near stellar surface , which in our model occurs up to @xmath34 , by : @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the scale height .",
    "the thin fluxtube approximation is reliable when the cross - section radius @xmath28 is negligible compared to both the scale height of the external medium and any variation scales along the tube ( spruit 1981 ; longcope and klapper 1997 ) .    expanding all variables as power series in @xmath39 ( @xmath27 along the tube radius ) , and neglecting terms of orders higher than 2 , equations ( [ a ] ) @xmath40 ( [ c ] ) give rise to a differential equation for the fluxtube cross - section : @xmath41 =   \\nonumber \\\\ \\left ( \\frac{a(r_{0})}{a(r ) } \\right ) ^{2 } \\left [ 1-\\left ( \\frac{b_{\\rm        ext } } { b_0}\\frac{\\left ( 1-\\alpha \\right ) } { \\left ( \\frac{a(r_{0})}{a(r)}-\\alpha \\right ) } \\right ) ^{2}\\right ] + 2\\beta \\frac{p(r)}{p(r_{0})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath30 is the filling factor and @xmath43 is the magnetic field strength outside the fluxtube . in the following calculations we fixed its value to be @xmath44 .    to simplify the set of equations",
    ", we will define the funnel area expansion as a function of radial distance by : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the expansion index , which is super - radial ( @xmath47 ) at the wind basis up to the merging radius when @xmath46 becomes 2 .",
    "@xmath46 is determined from equation ( [ d ] ) .      in a consistent model , to avoid assuming any empirical function for the magnetic field geometry and to determine the wind temperature at each wind position ( @xmath14 ) , we have to solve the energy equation , which is determined from the balance between wave heating and the adiabatic expansion and radiative coolings ( hartmann , edwards & avrett 1982 ) .",
    "thus , neglecting conduction , we write the energy equation as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the wave heating rate , @xmath27 the rate at which the gas is being heated due to dissipation of wave energy , and @xmath50 is the radiative cooling rate , both in erg  @xmath51  s@xmath2 .",
    "the wave heating can be written as @xmath52 and the radiative cooling is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electron density , @xmath55 is the hydrogen density and @xmath56 is the radiative loss function . here , we adopt the @xmath56 function given by schmutzler & tscharnuter ( 1993 ) and calculate @xmath54 with the modified saha equation given by hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) .    the wave energy density at each step may be calculated using a wkb approximation , from the wave action conservation .",
    "this approximation can often be employed when the properties of the medium vary slowly on a scale comparable to the wavelength ( usmanov _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the wave energy density is dissipated as follows : @xmath57 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the alfvn - mach number , @xmath59 the alfvn speed and @xmath60 the wave damping length .",
    "also , the wave flux ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath62 is evaluated by @xmath63 .",
    "we consider the non - linear damping mechanism , which length is given by ( jatenco - pereira & opher 1989 ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the averaged squared perturbation velocity amplitude and @xmath66 is the damping length at the wind basis , which is mainly dependent on the assumed wave frequency spectrum ( lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) . here",
    ", we will let it as a free parameter .",
    "the equations presented here fully describe the wind parameters and the magnetic field geometry under the given assumptions . in the next section",
    ", we show the main results by applying these equations in a typical cool supergiant star and compare them with previous works .",
    "for the last decades , the validity of a wind model was limited to simply reproduce the terminal velocity and the mass - loss rate of a given star . as a consequence",
    ", a number of accelerating mechanisms were found in accordance to observations .",
    "however , with the appearance of high resolution observations from more sensitive intruments , in the near future , the radial profiles of the wind parameters will become measurable and will be decisive on the choice of the wind model .    here , we obtained the wind paramenter profiles applying the described model on a cool supergiant star with @xmath67 = 16 m@xmath68 , @xmath69 r@xmath68 , @xmath70 g @xmath51 , @xmath71 g and @xmath72 k , as used by hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) in their model star 4 .",
    "we also assumed a filling factor @xmath73 , according to solar observations .",
    "for these stars , observational data reveal typical mass - loss rates of @xmath74 m@xmath68 yr@xmath2 and terminal velocities of @xmath75 km s@xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , the available data are limited in spatial resolution for most of the stars , and it is not possible to fit the complete radial profiles .",
    "( dashed line ) and that determined self - consistently in our model ( solid line ) . ]    assuming a surface magnetic field strength @xmath71 g , an alfvn waves flux of @xmath76 erg @xmath77 s@xmath2 at the wind basis and a low damped wave flux ( @xmath78 r@xmath79 ) , both the wind terminal velocity and the mass loss rate obtained were consistent with the observations .",
    "this value corresponds to a wave amplitude of @xmath80 , which is very plausible for a turbulent medium as that at the stellar surface ( suzuki & inutsuka 2005 ) .",
    "the velocity and temperature profiles for this case are shown in figure [ fig ] .",
    "the velocity profile reveals a peak of @xmath81 km s@xmath2 at @xmath82 r@xmath79 , and slightly decreases for larger distances until reaching the observed value .",
    "the temperature profile presents an initial negative gradient reaching temperatures @xmath83 k in a narrow region . also , near @xmath84 r@xmath79 the temperature reaches the maximum value of @xmath85 k. for @xmath86 r@xmath79 , where the wave heating and the radiative losses are low , the temperature decreases due to the adiabatic expansion .",
    "we propose a self - consistent wind model to determine the parameters profiles for a supergiant late - type star . to determine the magnetic field geometry we used an expansion method over the wind physical parameters as proposed by pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) . near surface ,",
    "the magnetic pressure inside the flux tubes are higher than that of the surrounding medium , forcing the field lines to curve .",
    "we found an initial super - radial expansion factor @xmath87 at the wind basis , much higher than the value used by previous authors ( e.g. jatenco - pereira & opher 1989 , bravo & stewart 1997 , dobrzycka _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) that included empirical relations to account for the magnetic field geometry based on solar observations .    considering a supergiant late - type star",
    ", we obtained the wind velocity and temperature profiles .",
    "typically , alfvn waves driven winds result in high velocity winds ( @xmath81 km s@xmath2 ) , unless some strong wave damping mechanism takes place at the wind basis .",
    "we showed that this conclusion is correct in the case of low divergent magnetic field structures . in this work ,",
    "the strong divergence is responsible for a rapid wave spatial dilution near surface , resulting in a lower wind velocity even for low damped waves .",
    "the obtained results were consistent to the typical mass - loss rate ( @xmath74 m@xmath68 yr@xmath2 ) and the terminal velocity ( @xmath75 km s@xmath2 ) observed for these objects .",
    "the velocity profile reveals an efficient acceleration at @xmath88 , reaching the maximum value @xmath89 km s@xmath2 . in this region",
    "the wind is mainly accelerated by the wave energy density and the thermal pressure gradients .",
    "afterwards , the absence of the wave acceleration and the cooling gas result in a decrease of the velocity to the observed values .",
    "for the temperature , assuming a weakly damped wave flux , the radiative losses and the expansion cooling are dominant near surface , and the temperature gradient is initially negative .",
    "the temperature falls to @xmath90 k in a sharp region and then , as density decreases as the wind accelerates and the flux tube expands , it increases up to @xmath91 k at @xmath82 r@xmath79 . for higher distances ,",
    "where the radiative losses are low and the wave heating is no longer effective , the temperature decreases mainly due to the adiabatic expansion .",
    "although the present calculations provided a new and interesting picture of the physical processes involving the heating and the acceleration mechanisms of cool stellar winds , the model presents a limitation .",
    "the wind equations were solved considering the thin fluxtube approximation . mainly for a high divergence wind , a complete 2-d set of equations",
    "must be employed in order to obtain more precise results .",
    "this step should be concluded in the near future .",
