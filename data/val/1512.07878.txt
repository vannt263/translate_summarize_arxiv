    "pristine graphene is gapless in the electronic spectrum , which hinders its application in some electronic devices like transistors .    in recent years",
    ", many methods have been proposed for opening a gap in the electronic spectrum of graphene @xcite .",

    "moreover , the tunable band gap and electronic properties in the monolayer heterostructure of hexagonal boron nitride and graphene ( h - bnc ) have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting and heuristic results in h - bnc is that the percentage of h - bn doped in the graphene layer can be used to tune the band gap @xcite .",
    "zero - energy modes , critical states in graphene s band structure , always lead to interesting and significant properties .",
    "pristine graphene shows minimum conductivity and the highest shot noise at the unique dirac point @xcite .",
    "it is found that the periodic potential induces new dirac points , and resonance occurs for specific conditions @xcite .",
    "it is shown that confinement of the charge carriers in graphene by electrostatic potentials is possible for zero - energy states @xcite .",
    "most recently , ferreira and mucciolo studied vacancy - induced zero - energy modes in graphene , and they proved that the early field - theoretical picture for the bdslowromancap1@ class @xcite is valid well beyond its controlled weak - coupling regime @xcite .",
    "further important progress reported recently is that the presence of majorana zero - energy modes is predicted in graphene / superconductor junctions @xcite .    inspired by these studies , our motivation here is to study the electronic band structure of heterosubstrate - induced graphene superlattices ( gsls ) , which refer to the gsls with periodically modulating substrates via the bn ( or sic , graphite ) and sio@xmath7 substrates .",
    "it is known that the behavior of electrons in graphene may be different on different substrates ; thus it is expected that the electronic properties in such heterosubstrate - induced gsls can be tunable .",
    "it would be useful to mention that such heterosubstrate - induced gsls could be fabricated technically by many advanced growth methods in electronics , like those in refs . .",
    "in this paper , we present a theory of tunable electronic band structures and zero - energy modes in the heterosubstrate - induced gsls .",
    "it is interesting to see that the electronic band gap of such heterosubstrate - induced gsls is dependent on the width ratio of different substrates .",
    "more importantly , this paper further shows further shows that there exist zero - energy states in such heterosubstrate - induced gsls , which may be controlled by applying unsymmetrical square potentials .",
    "these results are compared with those in the gapless gsls@xcite and the gapped gsls @xcite .",

    "the gapless graphene is fabricated on the sio@xmath7 substrates , and the gapped graphene is grown on the h - bn substrates @xcite .",
    "the difference between gapless and gapped graphene is whether an electronic band gap caused by the sublattice symmetry breaking exists . in gapless graphene , there is a famous linear band structure with a unique dirac point , whereas , in gapped graphene , a @xmath8-wide band gap near zero energy exists .",

    "in addition , compared with fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , the conductivity versus @xmath138 in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) has the same rising tendency if we ignore the resonance , which indicates that the potential ( represented by @xmath138 ) enhances the conductivity by generating more dirac points at zero energy .",
    "then we consider the effect of the structural disorder on the conductivity and the fano factor at zero energy .",
    "the percentage of the largest width derivation @xmath195 against @xmath209 is up to @xmath210 , and we show the conductivity and the fano factor under such structural disorder in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] explicitly shows that peaks of the conductivity and valleys of the fano factor still exist , although the shift of these peaks becomes more distinct .    finally , in experiments",
    ", we suggest that our results could be realized on a heterosubstrate such as sio@xmath2/bn @xcite , and the conditions are that one part of the inhomogeneous substrate breaks the sublattice symmetry , which leads to a symmetry gap around the fermi level , and another part does not .",
    "in addition , other devices which have a similar principle may be equally valid . for example",
    ", graphene with a band gap induced by patterned hydrogen adsorption @xcite can take the place of graphene on the bn substrate .",
    "in summary , we investigated the band gap around the fermi level and zero - energy modes of the electronic band structures of @xmath22d graphene - based superlattices placed on the heterosubstrate with periodic square potentials .",
    "it is found that the band gap s width can be almost linearly tuned by the proportion of inhomogeneous substrate if equal potentials are applied on the gsls , and the relation is robust against the effect of the structural disorder .",
    "the relation between the band gap and the proportion of an inhomogeneous substrate is exactly like comproportionation @xcite in chemistry , which will benefit the design of graphene - based electronic devices .",
    "moreover , the scaling law of the band gap is explained by the wave function and the dos .    for zero - energy modes ,",
    "the typical case of equal widths of an inhomogeneous substrate was discussed in detail .",
    "although the sublattice symmetry was broken for gapped graphene , we showed that dirac points emerge at zero energy if asymmetric potentials are applied on the gsls , but the dirac point at @xmath0 [ as @xmath211 exists only for specific potentials .",
    "once the dirac point at @xmath0 appears , the resonance occurs with the conductivity having a peak and the shot noise tending to be very low , which indicates that the transport becomes ballistic .",
    "furthermore , we found that the resonance occurs for the strong enhancement of the dos around zero energy , which is caused by the appearance of a dirac point at @xmath0 and its zero group velocity in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "general cases with unequal widths of the inhomogeneous substrate were also discussed , and part of the zero - energy states was described analytically .",
    "our prediction may be realized on a heterosubstrate such as sio@xmath7/bn , and other devices which obey a similar principle should be equally possible .",
