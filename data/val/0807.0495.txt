    "the capability of oscillations to probe the internal structure of stars is fully testified by solar studies .",
    "for this reason , pulsating stars , that are spread in the hr diagram , are expected to largely improve our knowledge of stellar evolution and physical assumptions in models .",
    "@xcite has shown that both radial and non - radial modes of pulsating stars are observationally distinguishable via the analysis of line profile variation ( lpv ) . from this pioneering work",
    ", there has been an increasing interest in lpv modeling driven by the improvement in resolution and efficiency of modern spectrographs : @xcite included the influence of stellar rotation , @xcite considered photospheric spots , @xcite performed a mode identification via the moments of the line profile or @xcite via the doppler imaging technique .",
    "@xcite noted that a pure kinematic approach is not enough for lpv modeling and that a realistic representation of the strength and broadening of spectral lines were necessary .",
    "they considered the atmosphere of a pulsating star as a perturbed status of the hydrostatic equilibrium and represented the temperature perturbation of atmospheric layers with a series expansion in terms of effective temperature and gravity .",
    "this operative method does not clearly represent the physics of @xmath0cep stars , pulsation modes do not change the energy production and the very small ( 1% ) stellar radius variation @xcite can not modify neither the effective temperature nor the surface gravity in an observable way .",
    "however along a pulsation cycle , the compression and expansion of photospheric layers change the dependence of temperature and pressure on optical depth and let the effective temperature appear variable , with the pulsation period , if determined in a limited spectral interval .",
    "a phenomenon indeed observed in some @xmath0 cephei stars by @xcite on the basis of a photometric approach .",
    "these authors derived a t@xmath1 variability up to 1000 k with the pulsation period , from geneva colours .    with the density and temperature , the variation of atomic level populations",
    "should also result in apparent surface gravity variations .",
    "in fact , there is an equivalence between stellar surface gravity and electron pressure in the framework of spectral line formation @xcite .",
    "a further contribution to the strength and profile of spectral lines comes from the microturbulence ( @xmath4 ) , that in principle could be modified along compression and expansion phases .    in this paper",
    "we analyse a set of time resolved spectra of @xmath0 cep (=  hd205021  =  hr8238 ) , which is generally accepted to be the proto - type of a class of hot pulsating stars , with the aim of ascertaining the apparent variability of the effective temperature , gravity and microturbulence with the pulsation period .",
    "these variations would strongly constrain any lpv method , as the one proposed by dupret and collaborators .",
    ".for each spectrum we report the heliocentric julian date , the radial velocity measured from the si iii triplet at 4550 , the t@xmath1 and @xmath3 determined through the h@xmath0 line .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,^,^ \" , ]     the number and equivalent widths of the silicon lines in our spectra are not enough to measure the microturbulence . however , the siiii triplet at 4552 , 4567 and 4574 is very sensitive to this velocity field and rules out a microturbulence range larger than 1.0 km s@xmath5 .",
    "table[equiv ] shows that for the microturbulence variation deduced from nitrogen lines , the silicon triplet would present a 25% variability of equivalent widths much larger than the 7% observed ( fig.[var_ew ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the microturbulence variability determined from nitrogen lines is a local minimum of the previous @xmath9 function and we assume a constant value for this velocity equal to the one we obtained from the average spectrum : @xmath4 = 8.1 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we find that the effective temperature and gravity of @xmath0cep are variable with the pulsation period ( tab .",
    "fig.[teff_var ] shows that t@xmath1 changes , almost sinusoidally from @xmath723700  k to 24400  k , in phase with the @xmath3 variability from 3.76 to 3.93 .    for a constant @xmath4 ,",
    "the variability of equivalent widths with the pulsation period is also indicative of the temperature behaviour along a cycle .",
    "fig.[var_ew ] shows that n ii and si iii lines are in phase and that they change out of phase compared to o ii and si iv .",
    "we have computed the expected equivalent widths of the representative lines of fig.[var_ew ] for atmosphere models with 20000  @xmath10  30000 k , @xmath3 = 3.91 , @xmath4 = 8.1 km s@xmath5 and abundance listed in table 2 .",
    "it appears ( fig.[teff_var ] ) that the observed behaviour of these lines is due to a variation of the effective temperature between 25000 and 26000 k. that is a result in agreement with @xcite who derived an effective temperature of 26000 k from the ratio of si iv and si iii line strength .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ teff_var ] shows the n ii abundance computed along the pulsational phase , considering the corresponding values of t@xmath1 and @xmath3 and keeping constant the value of @xmath4 ( 8.1 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "this reflects the variations of the ionisation state of nitrogen .",
    "with the aim of determining the variations of the effective temperature , surface gravity and microturbulence velocity that occur in hot pulsating stars during the pulsational cycle , we performed time resolved r=20000 spectroscopic observations of the prototype @xmath0  cep along a complete period coverage .",
    "as a first step , we confirm the t@xmath1 and @xmath3 found in a previous paper by @xcite and we measure @xmath4=8.1@xmath20.9  km  s@xmath5 , from a sample of single lines of oii . with these values , the abundances resulted to be solar for nitrogen , oxygen , neon , aluminium , silicon and sulfur , while slight under - abundances have been inferred for carbon , magnesium and iron .",
    "we find that along a pulsation cycle , after a correction for the pulsational doppler shift , the h@xmath0 line profile changes are matched assuming a variability of the effective temperature in the range of 23700 to 24400 k and a variability of gravity in the range of 3.76 to 3.93 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath11  0.08  dex measured in the gravity variation could lead the reader to the erroneous belief that it corresponds to a radius variation larger than the one computed by @xcite , via cinematic considerations .",
    "however , the variability of @xmath3 here determined for @xmath0  cep is not a consequence of changes in the surface gravity because of expansions and compressions of the star as a whole .",
    "we ascribed the @xmath3 variability to a change of the electron pressure @xcite induced by temperature , that modulates the ionisation state of metals .",
    "thus , it should not be linked directly to the radius of the star .",
    "metal lines are characterised by equivalent widths variable with the pulsation cycle .",
    "these are explained by a variable effective temperature between 25000 and 26000 k as a consequence of the changed ionisation state .",
    "it could be that the most extended formation region of the h@xmath0 line is at the origin of the lower temperature , in agreement with the 15% larger amplitude presented by the radial velocity measured through the h@xmath0 core .        as to the possibility that the microturbulence depends on the compression and expansion of the atmospheric layers",
    ", we find that it is constant within a 1.0 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "we conclude that pulsations modify the dependence of the temperature and pressure on the optical depth in the atmosphere of @xmath0  cep .",
    "this mimics a variability of the effective temperature and gravity when a small range of wavelengths is selected .",
    "we hope that this information can help in modeling the variability of spectral lines that is not only due to the pulsation velocity field @xcite .    along the expansion phase",
    ", the negative radial velocity is expected to increase up to a null value just in coincidence with the maximum of the stellar radius . at this phase of minimum compression",
    ", the photosphere is expected at the temperature minimum .",
    "differently , we observe a delay in the temperature minimum about one tenth of the pulsation period . according to @xcite ,",
    "this extra - phase shift is due to the non - adiabatic condition that occurs in the pulsating layers .",
