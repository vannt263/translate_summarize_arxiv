    "in recent years , movement for the achievement of the quantum information processing technology has been activated . since it is necessary to prepare a quantum state and to manipulate it accurately for the quantum information processing , we need a proper method to decide whether the realized quantum state is the intended state .",
    "for such a situation , we have to prepare two hypotheses .",
    "one is the null hypothesis @xmath3 , which corresponds to the undesired case .",
    "the other hypothesis is called the alternative hypothesis @xmath4 , which corresponds to the desired .",
    "then , both hypotheses @xmath3 and @xmath4 are incompatible with each other . in order to guarantee the desired property",
    ", it is sufficient to show that the null hypothesis @xmath3 is not true .",
    "this type formulation is called quantum hypothesis testing , which is the quantum counterpart of statistical hypothesis testing .    in this",
    "setting , when the hypothesis consists of one element , it is called a simple hypothesis and can be easily treated even in the quantum case . in particular , when both hypotheses @xmath3 and @xmath4 are simple , a construction method of an optimal test is guaranteed by the neyman - pearson lemma ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the asymptotic performance such as stein s lemma ( @xcite,@xcite ) , chernoff bound ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and hoeffding bound ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are studied .",
    "such a case has been studied extensively , including the quantum case . on the other hand ,",
    "when the hypothesis consists of plural elements , it is called a composite hypothesis . in realistic cases , it is usual that either @xmath3 or @xmath4 is composite . in the classical hypothesis testing ,",
    "composite hypothesis cases are well studied .",
    "especially , testing problems for the gaussian distribution frequently appear with various composite hypotheses .",
    "when there is disturbance in the basic hypothesis testing problems for the gaussian distributions , optimal tests are given by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 tests if the unbiasedness is offered for tests ( @xcite ) .",
    "these three kinds of testings are mostly applied in the classical hypothesis testing .",
    "however , compared to classical hypothesis testing , the composite hypothesis case is not well studied in quantum hypothesis testing .",
    "there exist only a few studies for testing entanglement among quantum hypothesis testing with a composite hypothesis ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , no quantum counterparts of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 tests have been studied .    in this paper , we focus on the quantum gaussian state ( @xcite ) that is a gaussian mixture of quantum coherent states in a bosonic system .",
    "quantum gaussian states @xmath5 have two parameters called the mean parameter @xmath6 and the number parameter @xmath7 corresponding to the mean parameter and the variance parameter of gaussian distributions .",
    "this kind of states frequently appear in quantum optical systems . for testing these states ,",
    "we propose quantum counterparts of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 tests for quantum gaussian states .",
    "the importance of gaussian distributions relies upon the ( classical ) central limit theorem .",
    "that is , the central limit theorem guarantees that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 tests can be applied to the i.i.d.(independent and identical distributed ) case even though the distribution family is not the gaussian distribution family .",
    "similarly , when many quantum states are independently and identically given , the quantum states are approximated by a quantum gaussian state due to the quantum central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that quantum gaussian sates can play the same role of gaussian distributions .",
    "hence , our quantum counterparts can be applied to many realistic quantum cases .",
    "the main difficulty is treatment of disturbance parameters because our quantum hypothesis testing problems contain them . for their proper treatment ,",
    "we sometimes adopt the min - max criteria for the disturbance parameters .",
    "that is , we optimize the worst value of the error probability concerning the disturbance parameters .",
    "since our problem is hypothesis testing , our target is deriving uniformly most powerful ( ump ) tests in the respective problems . under this framework",
    ", we focus on unitary group representation on the disturbance parameters .",
    "although the group symmetry method has been much succeeded in state estimation@xcite , it can be applied to quantum hypothesis testing in a few cases@xcite . under the respective symmetries ,",
    "the ump min - max test can be obtained among invariant tests . this argument in a more general setting is justified by quantum hunt - stein theorem@xcite .",
    "however , there exists other type of difficulty except for disturbance parameters .",
    "hence , combining quantum hunt - stein theorem with other reduction methods , we establish a general reduction theorem that reduces a complicated quantum hypothesis testing problem to a fundamental quantum hypothesis testing problem .",
    "this general theorem enables us to translate our quantum hypothesis testing problems to fundamental testing problems related to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 tests .",
    "another type of difficulty still remains even after the application of the above methods , but can be resolved by employing known facts in classical statistics .",
    "overall , we treat 8 quantum hypothesis testing problems for quantum gaussian states families as given in table 1 . their treatment is summarized in fig .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we review fundamental knowledges concerning the bosonic system and the quantum gaussian states .",
    "in particular , several useful unitary operators are explained . in section 3 , the framework of quantum hypothesis testing are stated and we restate quantum hunt - stein theorem in a min - max sense with the non - compact case .",
    "thereafter , we prepare some reduction methods on quantum hypothesis testing . in section 4 ,",
    "basic facts in classical hypothesis testing are reviewed . using them",
    ", we derive optimal test for fundamental testing problems related to @xmath0 and @xmath2 tests .    in sections 5 to 8 , using quantum hunt - stein theorem and our reduction theorem",
    ", we derive the optimal tests concerning quantum gaussian states @xmath8 in the respective settings , as is summarized in table 1 .",
    "especially , quantum counterpart of @xmath1 test is derived in section 5 .",
    "these optimal tests are constructed by quantum versions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 tests , which are based on the number measurement . in section 9 ,",
    "we numerically compare the performance for our optimal tests and tests based on the combination of the classical optimal test and the heterodyne measurement , which is the optimal measurement in the sense of state estimation .",
    "this comparison clarifies the advantage of our optimal tests . in section 10",
    ", we treat the relation of our quantum @xmath0 test with quantum state estimation . in section 11 , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we introduce quantum gaussian states in the bosonic system and some operations on the system .",
    "a single - mode bosonic system is mathematically represented by @xmath9 , which is spanned by sets @xmath10 of the @xmath11-th hermitian functions @xmath12 .",
    "a most typical example of a single - mode bosonic system is the one - mode photonic system , in which , the vector @xmath12 is called the @xmath11-photon number state because it regarded as the state corresponding to @xmath11 photons .",
    "then , @xmath13 forms a povm , which is called the * number measurement*. when the vector @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 the state @xmath16 is called the coherent state because it corresponds to the coherent light in the quantum optical system .",
    "then , the * quantum gaussian state * is defined as a gaussian mixture of coherent states in the following way : @xmath17 the mean parameter @xmath18 corresponds to the mean parameter of the gaussian distribution , and the number parameter @xmath19 does to the variance parameter of the gaussian distribution .    in the bosonic system @xmath20",
    ", we focus on the momentum operator @xmath21 and the position operator @xmath22 , which are defined by @xmath23 then , the * mean shift operator * @xmath24 plays the same role as the constant addition for a random variable distributed to a gaussian distribution .",
    "that is , it satisfies @xmath25 for any @xmath26 .",
    "we prepare a lemma about the mean shift operator .    for a bounded self - adjoint operator @xmath27 on @xmath28",

    "since the representation @xmath34 of @xmath35 on @xmath20 is irreducible , the above lemma is followed by the schur s lemma .    using the number operator @xmath36",
    ", we define the * phase shift operator * @xmath37 which satisfies @xmath38 for any @xmath39 .",
    "the phase shift operation plays the same role as the rotation for a random variable distributed to a two - dimensional gaussian distribution .",

    "in this section , we describe the formulation for the quantum hypothesis testing .",
    "in particular , we focus on the case when the composite hypotheses are given with the disturbance parameter . in order to treat such a situation with symmetry , we provide quantum hunt - stein theorem in the context of quantum hypothesis testing . in this paper ,",
    "the dimension of the quantum system @xmath92 of interest is not necessary finite , and is assumed to be at most countable .         in quantum hypothesis testing , in order to describe our hypotheses , the null hypothesis @xmath3 and the alternative hypothesis @xmath4 , we introduce two disjoint sets @xmath93 and @xmath94 of quantum states so that the unknown state @xmath95 belongs to the union set @xmath96 . then , our problem and our two hypotheses @xmath3 and @xmath4 are described in the following way : @xmath97 what we should do in quantum hypothesis testing is to determine whether @xmath95 belongs to @xmath93 or @xmath94 by applying a two - valued povm @xmath98 to the quantum system with the unknown state . in this method , we support the hypothesis @xmath99 when the outcome is @xmath100 . since an arbitrary two - valued povm @xmath98 is represented by an operator @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the identity operator ) as @xmath103 , an operator @xmath101 is called a * test ( operator ) * in hypothesis testing .",
    "there are two kinds of erroneous in the above decision way : to accept @xmath4 although @xmath3 is true and to accept @xmath3 although @xmath4 is true , which are called type i error and type ii error respectively",
    ". type i error and type ii error probabilities are expressed as @xmath104 then , the function @xmath105 is called the power of the test @xmath27 .",
    "a test with lower error probabilities is better , but type i and type ii error probabilities can not be minimized simultaneously . since there often exists a trade - off relation between type i error probability and type ii error probability , accordingly , we take a permissible error constant @xmath106 for the first error probability , which is called the _ ( significance ) level_. hence , we treat tests @xmath27 with level @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath108 for all states @xmath109 . then , we denote the set of tests @xmath27 with level @xmath107 by @xmath110 ,",

    "a problem to derive a ump test is often treated in quantum hypothesis testing , however a ump test may not exist when the null hypothesis @xmath4 is composite .",
    "then , we need to modify this formulation .",
    "a family of quantum states on a hypothesis testing problem often has parameters that are unrelated to the hypotheses .",

    "then , the optimal test with level @xmath107 is given as the test @xmath128 with level @xmath107 satisfying the following equation : @xmath129 we call the above optimal test a * ump min - max test * with level @xmath107 .",
    "our main task is to derive a ump test and a ump min - max test for various hypothesis testing problems of the quantum gaussian states in the following sections .",
