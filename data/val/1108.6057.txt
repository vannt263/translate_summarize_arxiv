    "disorder is omnipresent in solids due to defects and impurities . in his breakthrough theoretical investigation of non - interacting disordered systems",
    "anderson showed that coherent backscattering processes due to impurities are responsible for spatial localization of electronic wave functions.@xcite the scattering probability increases with the impurity density and beyond a critical value leads to spatial localization of the electrons .",
    "if the states at the fermi level become localized , the system becomes an anderson insulator . whereas in 3d systems",
    "the disorder strength has to overcome a certain threshold to drive the system from a metal to an insulator , in 2d and 1d systems any nonzero disorder strength is sufficient to cause localization in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite    on the other hand , a mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition in a pure system can be induced by electron - electron interaction for integer filling.@xcite in contrast to scattering by impurities , this many - body effect induces correlations and tends to distribute particles uniformly .",
    "numerical and analytical investigations via dynamical mean - field theory , exact diagonalization , quantum monte carlo and analytical calculations revealed a critical interaction strength in 3d and 2d at which the phase transition takes place.@xcite in one spatial dimension in the thermodynamic limit the mott phase is present at any interaction strength.@xcite    the physics resulting from the simultaneous presence of both effects is not yet fully understood .",
    "although interaction and disorder both lead to metal - insulator transitions , their action is competing : the repulsive electron - electron interaction favors uniform distribution of the particles , while disorder localizes the electronic wave function to a few lattice sites .",
    "several investigations have been performed on the competition between interaction and disorder in the anderson - hubbard model : such as a perturbative renormalization group ( rg)@xcite analysis and non - perturbative treatments via density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) techniques , to name just a few.@xcite in these studies the interplay was found to affect the system in a subtle way . for a semi - elliptic density of states in high dimensions the presence of both disorder and interaction was found to lead to a disordered metal surrounded by an insulating phase , the latter consisting of anderson and mott insulators continuously connected with each other.@xcite since in the first studies of non - interacting , weakly interacting , as well as strongly interacting 2d systems@xcite only insulating regions were found , it was believed for a long time that a metallic phase can not occur . however , theoretical studies via rg @xcite involving @xmath0 flavors of electrons predicted the existence of a quantum critical point , at which a metal - insulator transition takes place in 2d .",
    "this prediction was confirmed experimentally a few years later.@xcite in 1d bosonic systems a mott insulator , a bose glass and a superfluid phase were found,@xcite of which the latter is analogous to the metallic phase in fermionic systems .",
    "however , for repulsively interacting fermions in 1d perturbative rg calculations predicted a random antiferromagnet , where the fermions localize individually around randomly distributed sites.@xcite nevertheless , perturbative treatments of disorder can not be expected to capture the physics in the full range of couplings . in 1d up to now only next - neighbor interacting disordered spinless fermions have been studied exactly via dmrg@xcite where , based on the phase sensitivity , a delocalized phase for intermediate attractive interaction and disorder strength was found .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of spinful fermions with on - site interactions has not been determined yet .",
    "the careful experimental analysis of these phenomena requires tunability of the disorder and interaction strengths . during the last decade it has become possible to simulate theoretical models of solid state systems by ultracold atoms in optical lattices.@xcite due to the precise control over the system parameters and the possibility to artificially introduce",
    "different kinds of disorder , e.g. binary@xcite , bichromatic@xcite and speckle@xcite , these systems are highly suited for detailed investigations of disorder phenomena . in particular , the spatial dimensionality can be easily adjusted and the localization of bosonic matter waves in 1d@xcite and of fermions in 3d@xcite has already been observed .",

    "are found within our simulated system sizes , based on the real - space extension of dmft ( r - dmft ) and on dmrg . for their characterization ,",
    "the following physical observables were calculated : a ) the geometric average of the local density of states , representing its typical value , and its scaling behavior with the system size , b ) the charge gap in the thermodynamic limit , c ) the inverse participation ratio and its dependence on the system size .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian . the complementary dmrg and r - dmft methods applied in this paper",
    "are briefly explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "the resulting physical observables and a detailed analysis of the emerging delocalized , anderson and mott - hubbard regimes are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "strongly correlated disordered fermions on a lattice are described by the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 labels spin , while @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation , annihilation and particle number operators for an electron on site @xmath7 with spin @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the on - site interaction and @xmath10 is the nearest - neighbor hopping matrix element .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath11 are random variables , each distributed independently according to @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is a heaviside function and @xmath14 is the disorder strength . we consider a 1d bipartite lattice with commensurate filling @xmath15 . in the homogeneous case , i.e. for @xmath16",
    ", this hamiltonian can be solved exactly by means of the bethe ansatz.@xcite however , advanced numerical methods are required when the on - site energies are random .",
    "commonly used approaches to solve interacting quantum problems in one spatial dimension are the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) .",
    "the rg is able to capture localization and delocalization effects for repulsive as well as for attractive interactions .",
    "however , it describes the system accurately only for small disorder strength.@xcite in this paper we make use of dmrg which tackles strong disorder and strong interactions simultaneously , and allows for a determination of the phase diagram in a broad parameter range , similar to qmc .",
    "an alternative non - perturbative method for solving correlated fermionic problems is the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) . in combination with the geometric disorder average of the local density of states , this method allows to detect anderson localization as well.@xcite this latter approach is commonly referred to as typical medium theory . within dmft",
    "the self - energy is approximated to be local , which is only exact in infinite dimensions and is known to lead to qualitatively accurate results in 3d .",
    "its real - space extension , on the other hand , treats the single - particle problem - including disorder - exactly in any spatial dimension , while the self - energy becomes site - dependent.@xcite for this reason r - dmft is expected to be superior to single - site dmft in low dimensions . here",
    "we present a quantitative analysis by a comparison of r - dmft and dmrg results in 1d .",
    "our implementation of dmrg @xcite is based on a matrix product state variational formulation.@xcite the algorithm is formulated in the canonical ensemble ( fixed number of particles @xmath0 ) and at zero temperature .",
    "it makes use of the @xmath17 spin symmetry of the hamiltonian to significantly reduce the computational effort .",
    "the states are multiplet representations in the group theoretical sense , such that the actual number of different states is much larger than in a calculation with abelian symmetries only .",
    "we use system sizes of up to 128 sites and keep up to 600 states for the ground state calculations .",
    "when strong disorder is present , the algorithm has the tendency of getting trapped in excited ( metastable ) states with a slightly higher energy than the ground state . to solve this problem",
    "we apply nonlocal changes to the wave function by adding and removing a delocalized particle in a way that minimizes the energy . in most cases",
    ", this overcomes the barrier between the metastable states and the ground state such that subsequent dmrg sweeps will converge to the true ground state .",
    "we validate this convergence by starting dmrg from different initial states chosen from either the exactly solvable case with no interaction , the homogeneous case with no disorder or the classical case with no hopping .",
    "the single particle spectral function can be defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the ground state , @xmath20 is the energy of the ground state and @xmath21 the broadening constant .",
    "the calculation is done with a correction vector method .",
    "we keep up to 800 states and use a broadening constant of @xmath22 .",
    "this rather large broadening saves computational time and can be subsequently improved by performing a deconvolution of the spectral function.@xcite      r - dmft is the real - space extension of dmft which incorporates site - dependency of the self - energy.@xcite besides the description of the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition and magnetic ordering it is capable of treating spatial inhomogeneities such as disorder . each lattice site is mapped onto a single - impurity @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators in the bath ( on the impurity ) and @xmath8 represents the spin index . the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 determine the hybridization function @xmath28 which depends on the site index @xmath7 and is determined self - consistently .    for a given set of arbitrary hybridization functions , the solution of these effective quantum impurity problems is provided by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) for @xmath29 and leads to a set of one- and two - particle on - site green s functions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "these determine the self - energy matrix in real - space representation @xcite @xmath32 due to the lattice dyson equation , the interacting lattice green s function is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 are matsubara frequencies .",
    "the noninteracting green s function @xmath35 in real - space representation is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the unity matrix , @xmath38 is the matrix of hopping amplitudes , and @xmath39 represents the matrix of disordered on - site potentials .",

    "[ eq : gr_onsite ] .",
    "these constitute a set of new impurity problems to be solved by nrg , which closes the self - consistency loop .",
    "in order to describe the transition from delocalized to localized states it is useful to characterize the spectral properties of the system by the local density of states ( ldos ) , which measures the local amplitude of the wave function at a given site @xmath7 @xmath42 the calculation of the on - site green s function @xmath43 is based on the local spectrum for a particular disorder realization @xmath44 . in this work we focus on the paramagnetic solution and",

    "work averages over @xmath47 configurations were performed for each @xmath48 parameter set .",
    "the geometric average is a good approximation of the typical value of the probability distribution function for the ldos.@xcite thus , the geometrically averaged spectral function is critical at the anderson transition , i.e. it is finite in the delocalized regime and vanishes in the localized phase and therefore can be interpreted as an order parameter.@xcite the arithmetic average remains finite in the anderson - localized regime and corresponds to the global density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this classification is , however , only reliable in the thermodynamic limit @xmath49 . in finite systems",
    "a careful analysis of finite - size effects has to be performed . in a system of length @xmath46",
    "the spectrum is discrete and the non - interacting energy level spacing in the dos scales as @xmath50 .",
    "this discrete level structure due to the finite size can be smoothened by a broadening of each level to reconstruct the dos in the thermodynamic limit . unfortunately , spectral broadening with a width @xmath21 , which is necessary due to the finite system size , limits the spectral resolution of our calculations .",
    "the interaction - driven metal - insulator transition can therefore only be detected when the gap exceeds @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , the effect of the disorder strength is underestimated .",
    "disorder increases the energy level spacing in the ldos , which leads to localization . due to broadening this discretization is smeared out and anderson localization is observed at a larger value of @xmath14 than in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a further finite - size effect is the competition between the system size @xmath46 and the localization length @xmath51 .",
    "when localization sets in with increasing disorder , the localization length is larger than the system size and even exponentially localized states contribute spectral weight at all lattice sites in finite - size systems .",
    "accordingly , disorder - driven localization can only be identified for @xmath52 . due to these limitations ,",
    "the goal of our work is to reveal the localization / delocalization trends in the system rather than to determine sharp phase boundaries .    to investigate a possible emergence of a metallic phase ,",
    "@xmath53 is analyzed at the fermi level @xmath54 using r - dmft with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and 10 - 50 disorder configurations , and using dmrg with @xmath57 , @xmath22 and 16 disorder configurations , where the results are additionally deconvolved .",
