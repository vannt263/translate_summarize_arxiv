    "lattice models of correlated fermions coupled to collective bosonic modes have attracted renewed interest recently .",
    "the hubbard - holstein model@xcite is a paradigmatic model to study the interplay between phonon - mediated attraction of electrons and their electrostatic coulomb repulsion@xcite .",
    "the model exhibits a wide variety of phenomena , such as bipolaron formation@xcite , charge density waves ( cdw ) and phonon - induced superconductivity@xcite , a metal - insulator ( mott ) transition affected by the phonons@xcite , and non - fermi - liquid behavior@xcite .    besides the more traditional context of electron - phonon coupling , the hubbard - holstein model ( or , equivalently , the hubbard model with frequency - dependent interactions ) has been acquiring new applications within realistic theories of correlated materials @xcite .",
    "techniques based on density functional theory ( dft ) are used to compute the one - particle band structure of a material as a first step of combined numerical schemes such as local - density approximation plus dynamical mean - field theory ( lda+dmft ) @xcite and lda+@xmath0@xcite . on the next step ,",
    "electrons from a subset of correlated bands are identified with fermionic degrees of freedom of a lattice model .",
    "this downfolding procedure allows one to subsequently apply established many - body methods ( in particular , dmft)@xcite ) to account for correlation effects and obtain electronic spectral functions @xcite , optical conductivities @xcite , or transport properties ( see , e.g. ,  ) .",
    "this kind of calculation has recently acquired a new level of realism thanks to techniques allowing for first - principles calculations of the effective local hubbard interactions also : the constrained random - phase approximation ( crpa)@xcite even gives access to the energy - dependent matrix elements of the interaction .",
    "the energy dependence of this hubbard interaction @xmath1 reflects the fact that the high - energy itinerant states , which are projected out from the full band structure , dynamically screen the coulomb interactions between correlated electrons .",
    "these screening processes quite generally result in a substantial decrease of the static density - density interaction as parametrized by an energy - dependent slater parameter @xmath2 .",
    "they furthermore lead to renormalizations of the one - particle hopping @xcite . as a result , the phase diagram of the lattice model is substantially affected .",
    "dynamical impurity models are also a central ingredient of the gw+dmft method @xcite , combining many - body perturbation theory in the framework of hedin s gw approximation with dmft .",
    "indeed , inspired by _ extended _",
    "dmft @xcite , this method maps a system with long - range interactions onto an effective local problem with dynamical interactions , subject to a double self - consistency condition relating one- and two - particle propagators to their counterparts in the solid .",
    "the need for solving this dynamical effective impurity problem has been a serious bottleneck hindering the implementation of the scheme for quite some time , but the recent development of the bose factor ansatz ( bfa ) @xcite as an efficient impurity solver has finally unblocked the field @xcite . for a review of the current status , see @xcite .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory applied to the hubbard - holstein model with local phonons maps it onto an effective anderson - holstein model , parametrized by a bath hybridization function @xmath3 , which is subject to a self - consistency condition .",
    "solving the effective impurity model numerically amounts to obtaining its thermal green s function , @xmath4 , where the average is performed by using the action corresponding to the effective anderson - holstein model .",
    "inclusion of bosons into an impurity problem drastically enlarges the dimensionality of its state space , making it much more difficult to solve .    in principle , it is still possible to apply continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) algorithms to the anderson - holstein model . in practice , and in particular for applications to realistic materials , this is , however , not so straightforward : the weak - coupling algorithm by rubtsov@xcite can treat interactions with arbitrary frequency dependence , provided they are not too strong ( in comparison to the bandwidth ) and do not contain high - frequency components",
    ". in general , neither of these conditions is satisfied for realistic screened interactions - effective impurity models are usually found in antiadiabatic or intermediate regimes .",
    "a recently proposed generalization of the strong - coupling algorithm by werner and millis@xcite does not suffer from these problems , and has allowed for several recent applications within electronic structure calculations ; see , e.g. , .",
    "nevertheless , there is still an infamous problem associated with the extraction of real - frequency spectral data from imaginary - time results of a qmc run .",
    "a noticeable part of the spectral weight ( replica of the low - energy electronic structure ) can lie far outside the bare electronic band , when the impurity model is in the antiadiabatic regime .",
    "resolution of spectra of this kind is notoriously difficult for analytic continuation tools .    motivated by the mentioned problems ,",
    "a new family of techniques has emerged over the last few years .",
    "the `` bose factor ansatz '' ( bfa ) within the dynamic atomic limit approximation ( dala)@xcite was proposed as an approximate - yet accurate - scheme capable to circumvent the analytic continuation problem by reducing a given anderson - holstein problem to an effective anderson model . the resulting anderson model is readily solvable by existing impurity solvers , and the effect of the bosonic resonances is treated analytically within the bfa .",
    "even the above - mentioned reduction of the effective bandwidth compared to its bare value @xcite can be taken into account : the change can be estimated by means of a lang - firsov transformation@xcite and then incorporated into the dala approach ( dala+lf ) @xcite .",
    "following this route of study , in the present paper we introduce an approach to the anderson - holstein model based on a slave rotor representation@xcite .",
    "slave rotor variables were introduced in as an efficient means to decouple charge and spin degrees in low - energy models for correlated materials , even in the case of dynamically screened interactions . for impurity models in the dmft context",
    ", the formalism leads to a practical scheme allowing for an approximate solution of the dmft equations that correctly reproduces the mott transition and the main spectral features associated to it . in contrast to previous work , however , we use the slave rotors here to decouple the dynamical part of the density - density interaction only .",
    "it becomes clear within this framework , that dala and dala+lf can be understood as simple approximations made on fluctuations of the slave phase field .",
    "finally , we derive an effective mean - field modulation of the hybridization function @xmath3 induced by the coupling to the phase variables , leading to an optimized bose factor ansatz in the sense of feynman s variational principle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in the present paper , we will focus on the single - band hubbard model with dynamically screened coulomb interactions @xmath1 .",
    "electrons can hop from site to site on a periodic lattice : mathematically , electrons of spin @xmath6 are created ( annihilated ) on site @xmath7 by operators @xmath8 .",

    "the full density operators are defined as @xmath12 .",
    "the instantaneous part of the interaction is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "screening is contained in the retarded part @xmath14 , which is chosen to be negative and thus effectively reduces the on - site electron - electron repulsion .",
    "the retarded interaction @xmath15 can be represented as a superposition of modes each parametrized by a position of a resonance @xmath16 and coupling strength @xmath17 : @xmath18}{\\sinh[\\omega_\\alpha\\beta/2]}.\\ ] ] this expression is valid for @xmath19 and must be periodically continued outside the segment .",
    "we will also need a matsubara frequency variant of this expansion , @xmath20 with bosonic matsubara frequencies @xmath21 , as well as an equivalent real - frequency description , @xmath22}{\\sinh[\\epsilon\\beta/2 ] }      \\frac{d\\epsilon}{\\pi},\\ ] ] which uses a screening spectral function @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath24 dependence of the interaction makes it necessary to use the path - integral formalism and action ( [ s_h ] ) instead of a hamiltonian .",
    "however , in some cases , it is more convenient to introduce a set of bosonic modes at each lattice site with frequencies @xmath16 and write a hubbard - holstein model hamiltonian , which is equivalent to @xmath25 . in this case , the frequencies @xmath16 are identified with plasmonic resonances ( the `` charge cloud '' of the integrated out electrons plays the role of the plasma ) .",
    "the hamiltonian includes a term which couples electrons to the introduced bosons , @xmath26 the equivalence of @xmath25 and @xmath27 is readily verified by integrating out the @xmath28 variables .",
    "it is worth noting that the hubbard - holstein model and the corresponding action @xmath25 may be supplemented with additional site - local electron terms ( for instance , a local magnetic field ) , and most of the results of the present paper will stand .",
    "the slave rotor approach invented by florens and georges @xcite is an elegant and economic way to separate out and describe charge fluctuation in models of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "it was successfully applied to both impurity @xcite and lattice models @xcite , to study the bandwidth - controlled and doping - controlled mott transition @xcite , as well as to magnetism of multiorbital models @xcite . among other results ,",
    "a slave rotor decoupling of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath29 was described by florens in [ ] . here , we choose a different form of such a decoupling and",
    "provide a short reasoning for the choice later in this section .    within the slave rotor picture ,",
    "one introduces a `` rotor phase '' variable @xmath30 , which is conjugate to the full charge , and a new pair of fermionic variables @xmath31 ( called spinons hereafter ) .",
    "the rotor phase variable is related to the hubbard - stratonovich scalar @xmath32 field , which is often used to decouple density - density interactions between electrons , @xmath33 where the new fermion variables are proportional to the old ones with an additional complex phase given by @xmath30 , @xmath34 the switch of variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 is linear and thus the corresponding jacobians of path integrals are irrelevant constants .",
    "it is also worth noting that @xmath30 is introduced in such a way that there is no need to consider its static component : the resulting action and any correlation function appearing in the theory contain either a @xmath37 derivative of @xmath30 or a difference @xmath38 .",
    "the thermal green s function of the original electrons is readily expressed in terms of the new variables using definition ( [ d_f ] ) , @xmath39    when the slave rotor transformation is used to study lattice models , the degrees of freedom are usually introduced separately at each lattice site .",
    "some sort of a mean - field ( saddle - point ) approximation is then applied to the phase variables @xmath40 .",
    "this procedure allows for a decoupling of spinons and chargons and to estimate the role of either of the two subsystems in a given physical phenomenon .    here",
    ", we use the slave rotor representation in a slightly different fashion .",
    "our approach is based on dynamical mean - field theory @xcite ( dmft ) , mapping the lattice ( hubbard - holstein ) model onto an effective anderson impurity model with frequency - dependent interactions @xmath41 .",
    "this single - site anderson model is parametrized by a hybridization function @xmath42 , which is to be determined self - consistently .",

    "et al_. in [ ] , a @xmath32 field was used to decouple the full interaction term in the anderson model , including both dynamical and static parts .",
    "in contrast to that , our intention is to associate with rotors only the fluctuations caused by the dynamical part of the interaction .",
    "as shown below , this choice of decoupling provides us with a more convenient description of dynamical screening .",
    "the physical effect of the static component of the interaction is of a different nature than the finite - frequency components and it is convenient to treat it separately .    an inverted operator @xmath53 in the expression for @xmath54 should not be understood in a literal mathematical way .",

    "the thermal green s function factorizes into fermionic and rotonic parts if the corresponding degrees of freedom are not coupled in the action : @xmath65    in this specific limit , the low - energy dynamics of fermions is determined by the screened interaction @xmath66 , and the particular form of @xmath55 enters only into a bosonic weight - modulating factor in the green s function .",

    "@xmath80 fermions and the rotor get coupled through @xmath81 and the theory becomes nontrivial . the simplest approximation to treat the model in this case is to artificially suppress the coupling by putting @xmath38 to zero in @xmath81 ( the phase changes slowly over imaginary time ) .",
    "this approximation was introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] as a means to solve dynamic impurity models in the antiadiabatic limit at the cost of static ones and was dubbed the `` dynamic atomic limit approximation '' ( dala ) . in dala",
    ", one neglects any mutual influence of @xmath82 and fluctuations of the full charge , which are induced by the dynamical part of the screened interaction .",
    "obviously , this becomes a good approximation when the energy scales separate , as is the case in the antiadiabatic limit . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ g_thru_gf_gx ] ) , in dala we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 coincides with ( [ g_x_at ] ) and @xmath85 is calculated for a conventional anderson model with the given @xmath82 and the screened static interaction @xmath66 .",
    "the factorized form ( [ g_dala ] ) corresponds to what is called the bose factor ansatz ( bfa ) empirically introduced in [ ] for the antiadiabatic limit .",
    "interestingly , within the slave rotor formalism , this factorization stands disregarding approximations made on @xmath30 field and without limitations on the parameters of the hubbard - holstein model .",
    "this comes at the price , however , of introducing a coupling in the differential equations governing the behavior of the two factors , and , in this language , dala simply corresponds to the zeroth - order approximation in this coupling .",
    "the advantage of dala is that it provides a simple way to reuse existing quantum impurity solvers designed to work with purely static interactions .",
    "moreover , it substantially simplifies the ill - posed analytic continuation problem . extracting a spectral function @xmath86 from noisy output data of a qmc run for",
    "the original anderson - holstein model is a very difficult task .",
    "this is due to the presence of the aforementioned plasmon satellites . on the other hand",
    ", the spectral function @xmath87 corresponding to @xmath85 normally contains only low - energy scales [ not larger than @xmath88(bandwidth , @xmath66 ) ] and , for this reason , it is much easier to extract using a maximum entropy algorithm .",

    "( [ g_dala ] ) , the spectral function of physical electrons is a convolution , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the spectral function of rotors , which may be calculated from ( [ g_x_at ] ) at machine precision .",
    "the main limitation of dala is that it overlooks the influence of high - energy bosonic fluctuations on low - energy dynamics of correlated spinons .",
    "for example , the coupling of the fermionic degrees of freedom to bosonic fluctuations leads to an `` electronic polaron effect , '' enhancing the mass of the effective low - energy fermionic degrees of freedom or , equivalently , renormalizing the bare hopping matrix elements .",
    "this effect has been investigated in detail in ref . in the framework of lang - firsov transformation techniques . as pointed out in ref . ,",

    "when all bosonic resonances @xmath16 lie far above energy levels of an isolated atom and the boundary of the conduction band @xmath92 , the interplay of electronic and bosonic fluctuations may be accounted for in a simplified way .",
    "this task may be accomplished through construction of a low - energy effective model for electrons .    in this section , we present an effective model derivation based on the lang - firsov transformation .",
    "this derivation is a finite - temperature generalization of the approach proposed in ref .",
    "the lang - firsov transformation is a unitary change of a basis in the state space of @xmath27 .",

    "the polaron degrees of freedom represent electrons dressed by bosonic fluctuations .",

    "this simple renormalization is valid in the antiadiabatic regime and for not very high temperatures .",

    "before heading to the actual results , we would like to discuss the physical meaning of the modifications included in the `` optimal bose factor approach . ''",
    "to this end , we start from the dmft self - consistency condition , which  for a lattice with a bare dispersion law of electrons @xmath142reads : @xmath143 here , @xmath144 is the self - energy of the auxiliary anderson - holstein model . unfortunately , there is no simple form of this expression written in terms of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 ; any such equation in the frequency domain would inevitably contain convolutions , but not products .",
    "however , for the particular case of the bethe lattice with infinite coordination number the actual equation simplifies to @xmath148 i.e. , the dmft - loop for the spinons is built using a chargon - screened hopping parameter @xmath149 . for comparison , in dala one",
    "has the screening coefficient equal to @xmath150 and , in dala+lf , to @xmath151 .",
    "the proposed optimized bose factor ansatz has an important advantage over dala+lf : it leads to a redistribution of the spectral weight of @xmath91 rather than to a change of the full weight .",
    "indeed , the full weight is conserved and is equal to a discontinuous jump of @xmath139 at zero time : @xmath152          one can thus think of the approximation as replacing the simplistic band renormalization by a weight - conserving transformation of the noninteracting density of states .",
    "we illustrate this fact by plotting in fig .",
    "[ delta_tilde_figure ] the modifications induced onto the hybridization function corresponding to a model with semielliptic density of states .",
    "this quantity thus corresponds to the effective hybridization function for the bethe lattice@xmath153 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta - tilde])at the first iteration of the above - discussed self - consistency loop .",
    "as seen in the figure , there is always a low - frequency region of the density of states ( dos ) ( perhaps narrow enough ) in which the effect of dala+lf ( multiplication by @xmath5 ) is almost the same as from the optimized bfa .",
    "however , the disagreement grows stronger outside this region , as a value of the adiabatic parameter @xmath154 increases . in the deep antiadiabatic limit ( upper left plot ) , only a small part of the spectral weight is transferred to the plasmonic satellites and dala+lf indeed works well . for a larger value of @xmath154 and a small characteristic frequency ( upper right plot ) , a substantial part of the spectral weight is pulled out from the center of the conduction band .",
    "it is then transferred to a newly formed pair of `` wings , '' which effectively extend the bandwidth .",
    "the most drastic change of the dos occurs in the intermediate and adiabatic regimes ( lower plots ) .",
    "not only is a major part of the spectral weight transferred to the plasmonic satellites , but also the conduction band may completely change its shape and widen due to merging with the satellites .",
    "to solve the effective impurity model , we employed a hybridization expansion monte carlo solver ( ct - hyb ) , which is part of the triqs application suite@xcite .",
