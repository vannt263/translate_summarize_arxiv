    "the recent development of micro - pattern - gas - detectors ( mpgd ) allows an extended field of application for detectors with gas multiplication . for time - projection - chambers ( tpc ) the readout with gas - electron - multipliers ( gem ) @xcite has been demonstrated in conjunction with an unconventional readout option with high pixelation using the medipix2 chip @xcite .",
    "the timepix  @xcite and medipix2 is investigated the first time with 5 gev electrons from desy ii .",
    "they have the virtue of negligible multiple scattering . an external tracking with si - telescope",
    "provides information on the track position which is used for resolution determination and for the drift velocity measurements using a timepix chip .",
    "-0.5 cm [ stack ]    a cross sectional view of the triple gem plus medipix2 and timepix detector with an electron beam crossing the drift region is shown in fig.1 ( left part ) .",
    "the drift volume of 6 mm thickness and 10@xmath010 @xmath2 in size serves for charged track detection .",
    "the drift field is about 1.1 kv / cm .",
    "three cern - produced gems of the same area as the drift volume with 70@xmath3 m holes of 140@xmath3 m pitch are arranged in a stack above the readout plane with 2 mm ( 2 - 2 - 1 ) or 1 mm distances ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) for the transfer gaps , the latter provides a collapsed setup in order to study possible effects on the spatial resolution . with the triple gem stack gas amplification of @xmath410@xmath5 can be achieved with ar / co@xmath6 and he / co@xmath6-mixtures for the high resolution detection of minimum ionizing particles .",
    "the medipix2 and timepix chip is positioned at a distance of 1 mm from the last gem exposed to a field of e@xmath7 = 4.0 kv / cm .",
    "the advantage of a gem setup is the robust operation , since the fields of the gas multiplication region ( @xmath4 70 kv / cm ) are well shielded insige gem holes , see @xcite .",
    "the medipix2 and timepix chip has a surface of 14@xmath014 mm@xmath8 and a pixel size of 55@xmath055@xmath1 .",
    "it is positioned close to the border of the gem stack , see fig .",
    "1 ( right part ) .",
    "the remaining surface of the gems is covered with 24 anode pads of 2@xmath9@xmath2 size for monitoring purposes .",
    "the gas tight box contains the gems , the resistor chain , the timepix and medipix2 chip and the readout electronics of the pads .",
    "+ the readout of the medipix2 and timepix is done with muros2 using the fast shutter option .",
    "the thresholds for the pixels used were 990e@xmath10 and 830e@xmath10 for the medipix2 and the timepix , respectively .",
    "the electron beam is defined by trigger scintillating counters of 1@xmath01.5 @xmath2 in size and a si - telescope with 3 planes of strips ( two planes allow measurement of the x - coordinate in front and behind the gem plus medipix2 and timepix , and one plane is used for the y - coordinate measurement in front of the detector ) . the effective readout pitch of si - telescope is 50@xmath3 m .",
    "the timepix has a clock , which is distributed throughout the entire chip .",
    "a register on each pixel counts the number of clock cycles in a way depending on the chosen mode of operation . for each pixel",
    "this mode can be set individually . in time - mode",
    "the cycles are counted from the point when the signal crosses the threshold till a common stop by the gate signal ( = `` fast shutter '' ) .",
    "the other mode `` time - over - threshold '' records the clock cycles as long as the pulse is above the threshold .",
    "the maximum number of counts in this measurement is limited by the chosen gate width of @xmath11 , which is about 600 counts at a given clock frequency of 48mhz .    in a special configuration `` mixed mode ''",
    "every other pixel switches the time and tot mode in checker board fashion .",
    "this results in 1/2 of all pixels are of time - type and another 1/2 of the tot - type .",
    "this allows a proximity information of both time and tot .",
    "typically , 8 - 9 non - separated clusters per track were observed , see fig .",
    "2 ( left part ) . images with double tracks were not considered in the current analysis .",
    "the following three clustering methods were used , where last two can separate the overlapping clusters using the charge deposition information ( tot or mixed modes ) resulting in everage 10 - 11 clusters per event :    * `` contiguous areas '' method leaves overlapping clusters not separated .",
    "that method is applicable for any timepix mode .",
    "the result is a lower number of clusters depending on the effective threshold settings and therefore not covered here * `` saddle point '' method separates the contiguous clusters making a line for secondary maximum in a projection transverse to track .",
    "the line divides the merged clusters at the saddle point * `` island '' method joins the adjacent pixels with a nonzero tot values into clusters in the way that a pixel is joined into the cluster of its neighbor with a highest tot value .",
    "the procedure is repeated for each pixel to produce a unique assignment of pixels to clusters .",
    "it results in a separation in two spacial coordinates available compared with the above case    -0.1 cm [ sigma0 ]    the evaluation follows basically @xcite : a cluster is rejected if it contains less than 9 hits .",
    "the noise is removed beyond the cluster region .",
    "two different methods of the straight line fits to the centers of the clusters result in an inbiased estimation of the standard deviation .",
    "residuals of the fit to all cluster centroids ( n ) and a fit to ( n-1 ) centroids resulting in a residual of the exempt cluster which is permutated over all clusters .",
    "these residuals enter into two gaussian fits which produce @xmath12 .    the left part of fig .",
    "2 shows a measured dependance of the resolutions versus the drift space for ar / co@xmath6 . in the drift region to separate the lateral diffusion within the drift space from the intrinsic gem plus timepix and medipix2 resolution the y - coordinate information of the external telescope is used .",
    "the following parametrisation is applied for the fit : @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 equal to 24.9 @xmath15 0.4 results from the fit for ar / co@xmath6 .",
    "the results of spatial resolution @xmath14 and @xmath16 corresponding to different clustering methods for ar / co@xmath6 and he / co@xmath6 are summarised in tab .  2 .",
    "the comparison with heed simulations  @xcite is also given in the table .",

    "the slope depends on the size of merged clusters because a higher number of electrons per detected cluster than for an ideally resolved cluster is present .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the effective transverse diffusion through the active volume and reduces the slope parameter .",
    "based on this observation it is possible that the discrepancy of the monte carlo with respect to the slope is present , since the average number of detected clusters lower by a factor of 2 than expected from simulations  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the eudet project for its financial support and the medipix collaboration for supporting us work with readout software and hardware , especially with respect to the timepix chip used for the very first time in an experiment .",
    "we would also like to thank michael campbell , erik heijne , xavier llopart and fabio sauli for stimulating discussions and a lot of valuable advices .",
