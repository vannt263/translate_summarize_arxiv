    "the egret telescope on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) identified at least six young spin - powered @xmath0-ray pulsars @xcite at energies up to 20  gev . a search for pulsed emission above 20  gev remains to be successful for ground - based cherenkov instruments .",
    "despite a reduction of the energy threshold down to 60  gev @xcite , achieved with the the non - imaging telescopes , no evidence of a pulsed signal has been seen so far .",
    "it is widely accepted that this unexplored energy region is vital to address the long - standing question of how and where high energy emission emerges from the pulsar .    _",
    "polar cap _ models ( for review of the models see @xcite ) assume that particles are accelerated right above the neutron star surface and that @xmath0 rays emanate from curvature radiation or inverse compton induced pair cascades in a strong magnetic field . on the other hand _",
    "outer gap _ models consider particle acceleration which occurs along null charge surfaces in the outer magnetosphere where @xmath0-rays result from photon - photon pair production - induced cascades .",
    "these two types of basic models make rather different predictions , particularly of the spectral characteristics of pulsed @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "detection and study of this high energy emission , which is closely tied to the primary population of radiating particles , seems to be a good discriminant between pulsar models .",
    "the _ high energy stereoscopic system _ ( h.e.s.s . ) of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes with a low energy threshold of 100  gev at zenith and below 1% crab flux sensitivity for long exposures @xcite was used for observations of three young pulsars : the crab and vela pulsars , and psr  b1706 - 44 , characterized by their high - ranking position on a list of pulsars ordered by the parameter @xmath1 , which ultimately determines pulsar luminosity at high energies for a given pulsar age . here",
    "@xmath2 is the spin - down energy loss rate , and @xmath3 is the distance determined from the dispersion measure to the object .",
    "the spectra of the egret - detected pulsars can be described quite well by simple power laws with spectral indices in the range 1.39 - 2.07 @xcite .",
    "some of the spectra show clear evidence for a drop in flux at high energy , above few gev , whereas others have rather large uncertainties in the 4 - 10  gev band , which prevent the clear identification of a similar cutoff .",
    "the measured crab spectrum is a straight power law .",
    "extrapolation of egret spectra into the dynamic range of h.e.s.s . suggested that high energy pulsed emission might be observable from these objects within a reasonable exposure time @xcite .",
    "the outer gap model also supplements pulsed tev emission via inverse compton scattering by gap - accelerated particles .",
    "the most recent outer gap models @xcite have tev @xmath0-ray fluxes for the vela pulsar which should be detectable with h.e.s.s .",
    "is an array of four atmospheric imaging cherenkov telescopes , each with @xmath4 of mirror area and equipped with a 960 photo - multiplier tube camera @xcite .",
    "telescopes are operated in a stereoscopic mode with a system trigger , requiring at least two telescopes to provide images of each individual atmospheric shower in cherenkov light .",
    "h.e.s.s . has large field of view of @xmath5 diameter .",
    "the angular resolution for individual @xmath0 rays is better than @xmath6 .",
    "it allows a very good source localization accuracy of 30@xmath7 for relatively faint sources , which is important for point - like source ( e.g. pulsars ) identification .",
    "a substantial fraction of the data on young pulsars was taken during the construction phase of the h.e.s.s .",
    "array , when only two or three telescopes were available .",
    "short summary of data is given in table  [ data ] .",
    "the crab pulsar , located in the northern sky , can be observed with h.e.s.s . only at a rather large average zenith angle ( @xmath8 ) and consequently above rather a high energy threshold ( @xmath9 ) , whereas vela and psr b1706 - 44 can be seen with h.e.s.s .",
    "at much higher elevations .",
    "most of the data were taken in so - called _ wobble _ source - tracking mode , which is optimal for observations of a point - like source .",
    "a few additional hours of observations of psr  b1706 - 44 have been extracted from the long scan of the galactic plane @xcite .       derived cutoff energies for three young pulsars",
    "observed with h.e.s.s .",
    "are given in table  [ results ] .",
    "the stringent integral upper limits above 200 - 300  gev reported here for three young pulsars after rather limited exposures with h.e.s.s .",
    "appear to be still above the predictions by the polar cap and outer gap models at these energies .",
    "therefore , these upper limits can not be used to discriminate between two competing models .",
    "however , they can severely restrain the luminosity of pulsed @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "in addition , for the vela pulsar the outer gap model predicts a rather flux emission via inverse compton scattering at tev energies @xcite , which is inconsistent with the model - independent h.e.s.s .",
    "upper limits reported here .",
    "the inverse compton flux level depends on the emission spectrum mainly in the infra - red band , which is difficult to measure in most pulsars .",
    "thus the h.e.s.s .",
    "upper limits in particular for vela pulsar constrain the density of local soft photon field in the gap .",
    "* acknowledgement .",
    "* the support of the namibian authorities and of the university of namibia in facilitating the construction and operation of h.e.s.s . is gratefully acknowledged , as is the support by the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) , the max planck society , the french ministry for research , the cnrs - in2p3 and the astroparticle interdisciplinary programme of the cnrs , the u.k . particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) , the ipnp of the charles university , the south african department of science and technology and national research foundation , and by the university of namibia .",
