    "quantum tunneling plays crucial roles in various aspects of the quantum field theories . to name a few in high energy physics , supersymmetry breaking @xcite , baryon and lepton number violation phenomena in the standard model @xcite , asymptotic estimates of the perturbation theories @xcite are among them .",
    "analysis of the phenomena is often carried out in the imaginary - time path - integral formalism , in which existence of the dominating configuration , instantons or bounces , makes analytical treatment possible .",
    "there however are cases when no ( regular ) solution of the equation of motion exists .",
    "a gauge theory with higgs scalars is the most infamous , although a class of scalar theories that exhibit similar features exists .",
    "not all the hope is lost , however .",
    "the ordinary instanton does not exist in these theories due to a scaling property : it can be shown that among all the configurations of finite euclidean action , only the zero - radius configuration can be a solution of equation of motion .",
    "consequently , all of the evaluations mentioned above were done by the so - called constrained instanton formalism @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", one introduces a constraint to define a sub - functional space of finite radius configurations .",
    "the field equation is solved in this subspace and the finite - radius configuration similar to instantons is defined . after doing the one - loop ( and possibly higher order ) integral in this subspace , the constraint parameter is integrated over .",
    "the configuration constructed this way is called `` constrained instanton '' .",
    "one problem about this method is that its validity depends on the choice of the constraint : since in practice one does the gaussian integration around the solution under the constraint , the degree of approximation depends on the way constraint is introduced .",
    "unfortunately , no known criterion guarantees the effectiveness of the approximation .",
    "this situation could be remedied once one realizes that what we have near the point - like ( true ) instanton is the valley @xcite .",
    "that is , although the zero - size instanton may be the dominating configurations , it is expected to be followed by a series of configurations that makes the valley of the action .",
    "therefore , instead of trying to cover all the neighborhoods of the zero - radius instanton , one may cover the valley region , which is expected to dominate the path - integral .",
    "the trajectory along the valley bottom should correspond to the scaling parameter , or the radius parameter of the instanton .",
    "as such , the finite - size instanton can be defined as configurations along the valley trajectory .",
    "this is similar to a calculation in the electroweak theory in which one evaluates the contribution of the instanton - anti - instanton valley @xcite . thus treating a single instanton as a configuration on the valley provides a means of unifying the approximation schemes .",
    "these configurations are named `` valley instanton '' .    one convenient way to define",
    "the valley trajectory is to use the new valley method @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply this formalism to construct the actual valley instantons in the scalar system and the gauge - higgs system and investigate their features .",
    "since the constrained instanton has been used extensively in the existing literature , our main purpose here is to establish the existence of the valley instanton on a firm basis and compare its properties with that of the constrained instanton .",
    "this should serve as a starting point for the reanalysis of the existing theories and results under the new light .    in the next section",
    ", we review the definition and the properties of the new valley method .",
    "emphasis is placed on its various advantages as a generalization of the collective coordinate method .",
    "these features are demonstrated in a toy model with two degrees of freedom . in section [ sec : sft ] , we study a scalar theory where a mass scale prevents the existence of the finite - size instantons . the valley instanton is constructed both analytically and numerically and is compared with the constrained instanton .",
    "more interesting and practical application of the idea of the valley instanton is in the gauge - higgs system .",
    "the analysis of this system is carried out in the following section along the similar line .",
    "the last section gives the discussion and comments .",
    "# 1#2@xmath1 # 1([eq:#1 ] )    the new valley method is most easily examined in the context of the discretized theory .",
    "the results thus obtained can be readily generalized to the continuum case .",
    "we discretize the space - time and denote the resulting real bosonic variables by @xmath2 .",
    "these variables are the `` coordinates '' of the functional space we carry out our analysis .",
    "the bosonic action is written as a function of these variables ; @xmath3 in this notation , the equation of motion is written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the metric of the functional space is trivial in these variables .",
    "otherwise , the metric should be inserted in the following equations in a straightforward manner .",
    "the new valley equation is the following ; where summation over the repeated indices are assumed and since has a parameter @xmath6 , it defines a one - dimensional trajectory in the @xmath7-space .",
    "the solution of the equation of motion apparently satisfies the new valley equation . in this sense",
    "the new valley equation is an extension of the ( field ) equation of motion .",
    "according to the new valley equation , the parameter @xmath6 in the right - hand side of is one of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the new valley equation specifies that the `` gradient vector '' @xmath9 be parallel to the eigenvector of @xmath8 with the eigenvalue @xmath6 .",
    "a question arises which eigenvalue of @xmath8 should we choose for .",
    "as we will show later , the new valley method converts the eigenvalue @xmath10 to a collective coordinate , by completely removing @xmath10 from the gaussian integration and introducing the valley trajectory parameter instead .",
    "thus the question is which eigenvalue ought to be converted to a collective coordinate for the given theory . in the scalar field theory with a false vacuum ,",
    "it was chosen to be the lowest eigenvalue , which corresponds to the radius of the bounce solution @xcite .",
    "it was the negative eigenvalue near the bounce solution .",
    "this was because the particle - induced false vacuum decay was the subject of interest , for which smaller size bubbles are relevant .",
    "the general guideline , however , is to choose @xmath10 to be the eigenvalue with the smallest absolute value , _",
    "i.e. , _ the pseudo - zero mode , for the gaussian integration for such direction converges badly or diverges .",
    "if a lower and negative eigenvalue exists below @xmath10 , it simply creates the imaginary part . in the later sections",
    ", we follow this guideline .",
    "the new valley equation can be interpreted within a framework of the variational method : let us rewrite it as the following ; this means that the norm of the gradient vector is extremized under the constraint @xmath11 const , where @xmath6 plays the role of the lagrange multiplier .",
    "in addition , we require that the norm be _",
    "minimized_. we are therefore defining the valley to be the trajectory that is tangent to the most gentle direction , which is a plausible definition , as we will see later in a simple example .",
    "this also gives us an alternative explanation for the fact that the solutions of the equation form a trajectory .",
    "the functional integral is carried out along this valley line in the following manner : let us parametrize the valley line by a parameter @xmath12 ; the solutions of are denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "the integration over @xmath12 is to be carried out exactly , while for other directions the one - loop ( or higher order ) approximation is applied .",
    "we are to change the integration variables ( @xmath2 ) to @xmath12 and a subspace of @xmath14 .",
    "this subspace is determined uniquely by the following argument : in expanding the action around @xmath13 , the first order derivative term is _ not _ equal to zero , for @xmath13 is not a solution of the equation of motion . in such a case ,",
    "the @xmath15-expansion is no longer the loop expansion , as the tree contribution floods the expansion .",
    "therefore , we force this term to vanish by the choice of the subspace .",
    "this choice of subspace is most conveniently done by the faddeev - popov technique .",
    "we introduce the fp determinant @xmath16 by the following identity ; where @xmath17 .",
    "the solution to the above equation is , in the one - loop approximation , the second term can be neglected and the fp determinant contains the cosine of the angle between the gradient vector and the vector tangent to the trajectory .",
    "this is simply a jacobian factor , because the trajectory is not necessarily orthogonal to the chosen subspace .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig.[fig : valillust ] .",
    "c14 cm    substituting into the path integral for the vacuum - to - vacuum transition amplitude , we obtain the second ( functional ) integration , @xmath18 , corresponds to the integration in the subspace denoted by the dotted line in fig.[fig : valillust ] . at the one - loop order ,",
    "the @xmath2 integration yields @xmath19 , the determinant of @xmath8 restricted to the subspace .",
    "this subspace is orthogonal to the gradient vector , which is the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue @xmath6 according to the new valley equation .",
    "therefore this subspace is the whole space less the direction of the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the resulting determinant is simply the ordinary determinant less the smallest eigenvalue @xmath6 ; we thus obtain the following expression at the one - loop order ; in this sense , the new valley method converts the smallest eigenvalue to the collective coordinate .",
    "this exact conversion is quite ideal for the actual calculation in the following sense : in physical situation one often suffers from a negative , zero , or positive but very small eigenvalue , which renders the ordinary gaussian integration meaningless or unreliable .",
    "the new valley method saves this situation by converting the unwanted eigenvalue to the collective coordinate .",
    "the factor @xmath19 is exactly free from this eigenvalue .",
    "an added bonus to this property is that the resulting det@xmath20 is quite easy to calculate ; we simply calculate the whole determinant and divide it by the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "if several unwanted eigenvalues exist , the new valley method can be extended straightforwardly .",
    "the equation should then specify that the gradient vector @xmath21 lie in the subspace of the unwanted eigenvalues .",
    "this leads to a multi - dimensional valley with all the advantages noted above .",
    "there is another valley method , called  streamline method \" @xcite , which has been extensively used in the literatures .",
    "it proposes to trace the steepest descent line starting from a region of larger action . by this definition ,",
    "its jacobian is trivial at the one - loop order .",
    "nevertheless , its subspace for the perturbative calculation has no relation to the eigenvalues of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the determinant is not guaranteed to be free from the unwanted eigenvalue(s ) .",
    "another problem is that it is a flow equation in the functional space : since it is not a local definition in the functional space , it does not define any field equation .",
    "therefore the construction of the configurations on the valley trajectory is quite difficult .",
    "another problem is that it suffers from instability if the valley is traced from the _ bottom _ of the valley .",
    "this is not an issue for the problem of the instanton and anti - instanton valley , for which the higher end of the valley is known to be the pair separated by infinite distance .",
    "yet this instability makes the streamline method useless for the current problem , for we only know the bottom of the valley , the zero - size instanton . for more detailed comparison of these methods and other features of the new valley method",
    ", we refer the readers to ref.@xcite .",
    "let us discuss a toy model in a two - dimensional functional space , to show the power of the new valley method .",
    "the two degrees of freedom in the model is denoted as @xmath2 ( @xmath22 ) , and the action is given by the following , this is constructed by distorting a simple parabolic potential so that the valley trajectory is not trivial .",
    "the new valley equation is now a simple algebraic equation , which can be solved numerically .",
    "alternatively , we could reparametrize the functional space by @xmath23 defined by the following ; under this parametrization @xmath24 . therefore following the variational interpretation of the new valley equation",
    ", we can minimize the square of the norm of the gradient vector , @xmath25 , as a function of @xmath26 . in fig.[fig : toymodel ] , the thin lines denote the @xmath27 constant lines , and the thick solid line denotes the new valley trajectory .    as an analogue of the constrained instanton formalism in this toy model , we introduce a simple constraint .",
    "near the origin the valley trajectory extends to the @xmath28 direction .",
    "any reasonable constraint has to reproduce this property .",
    "therefore , as a simple example for the constraint , we choose the following ; the solution of the constraint method is plotted in fig.[fig : toymodel ] by the dashed line .    in fig.[fig :",
    "toymodel ] , it is apparent that the new valley trajectory goes through the region of importance , while the constrained trajectory does not .",
    "this property can be displayed more explicitly by considering the analogue of the physical observables @xmath29 defined by the following ; following the prescription given above , we have carried out the numerical evaluation of @xmath29 exactly and by the gaussian (  one - loop \" ) approximation around the new valley trajectory and the constrained trajectory .",
    "table.[tab : toyratio ] gives the ratio of the one - loop values over the exact value .",
    "c14 cm    as is seen in the table , the new valley method gives a better approximation than the constraint method in this range of @xmath30 consistently .",
    "this could be explained in the following manner ; one could calculate the position of the maximum of the integrand in , or the following  effective action \" ; the peak positions calculated in this manner are denoted in fig.[fig : toymodel ] by dots .",
    "the point @xmath31 in the left bottom is for @xmath32 , @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the dots are distributed around the new valley trajectory .",
    "this explains the fact that the new valley trajectory gives the better approximation over the constrained trajectory .",
    "only when the power of one of the observable gets high enough as in the point @xmath35 , the constraint method starts to give a little better values .",
    "however , this is exactly the range in which the ordinary instanton calculation starts to fail ; for the @xmath39-point function with @xmath40 , it is well known that one needs to take into account the effect of the external particles on the instanton itself .",
    "the power of the valley method lies in the fact that even in this range the calculation is done with good accuracy for generic type of observables , like the ( 12,12 ) case .",
    "only when the observable is very special , like the ( 12,2 ) case , the constraint method tuned to that operator may give reasonable estimates .",

    "the fermionic part of the action is given by , @xmath300 where @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "this system can be regarded as the simplified standard model , in which the u(1 ) and su(3 ) coupling constants are equal to zero and the kobayashi - maskawa matrix is the identity .",
    "the fermionic zero mode around the valley instanton is given by the following equation ; @xmath304 where @xmath240 in the covariant derivative @xmath305 and @xmath241 are the valley instanton .",
    "we obtain the zero mode for leptonic sector by replacing @xmath306 and @xmath307 in the solution of the above equation with @xmath308 and @xmath90 , respectively . in general , the valley instanton is given by , @xmath309 where @xmath310 is a global su(2 ) matrix and we choose @xmath311 as ( 0,1 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath203 and @xmath103 have been studied in the previous subsections .",
    "the solution is given by , @xmath312 where the greek and the roman letters denote indices of spinor and isospinor , respectively .",
    "the masses of fermions are given by @xmath313 .",
    "the functions of @xmath75 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 and @xmath316 are the solution of the following equation ; @xmath317 for small @xmath163 , the solution is given approximately , by the following ; @xmath318 \\displaystyle   -2 \\pi^2 \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}g_{\\rho m_u}(r ) , & \\quad \\mbox{if } \\quad r \\gg ( \\rho m_u)^{-1/2}\\ ;       \\end{array } \\right.\\\\ & & u_r(r)=\\left\\ {      \\begin{array}{ll } \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{r^2 + 1 } , & \\quad \\mbox{if } \\quad r \\ll ( \\rho m_u)^{-1/2}\\ ; \\\\[0.4 cm ] \\displaystyle   2 \\pi^2 g_{\\rho m_u}(r ) , & \\quad \\mbox{if } \\quad r \\gg ( \\rho m_u)^{-1/2 } ,       \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath319 and @xmath320 are obtained by replacing @xmath321 with @xmath322 .",
    "if the masses of fermions are too small , the above approximative behavior is correct even though @xmath163 is @xmath323 .",
    "in this paper we have examined instanton - like configurations in the theory where a mass scale prevents the classical solution with a finite radius .",
    "a natural way to construct the instanton - like configurations is the one based on the new valley method .",
    "the resulting configuration , which we call `` valley instanton '' , has been shown to have desirable behaviors . since a direction",
    "along which the action varies most slowly is chosen as the collective coordinate , it is expected that this method gives a more plausible approximation than the constrained instanton .",
    "indeed this has been assured in the toy model in section [ sec : nv ] . in the new valley method , the corresponding quasi - zero mode in the gaussian integration",
    "is removed completely , then it gives a smooth extension of the ordinary collective coordinate method in the case where zero modes exist and this makes the evaluation of the gaussian integration more easily .    to clarify the effectiveness of the method in the field theory ,",
    "detail comparisons between the valley instanton and the constrained instanton in the scalar @xmath0 theory and the su(2 ) gauge - higgs system have been carried out .",
    "when the size of the configuration is small , the valley instanton can be constructed analytically .",
    "the differences from the constrained instanton is rather small in this case . for the configuration with a large radius ,",
    "we have constructed both instantons numerically .",
    "it is found that the remarkable differences between them appear in this case . in the scalar @xmath0 theory , while the action of the valley instanton increases monotonously and remains being positive , the one of the constrained instanton becomes negative when the radius becomes large .",
    "there also exist the differences between them in su(2 ) gauge - higgs system .",
    "in addition , we found that the valley instanton has a very similar configuration to the instanton even when the radius is large both in the scalar @xmath0 theory and the su(2 ) gauge - higgs system .. as is shown later , the valley instanton at @xmath324 is relevant to the baryon number violating process with many gauge and higgs particles , @xmath325 . since the sphaleron decay , which is not a tunneling process , becomes important at @xmath326 @xcite , this deviation could be naturally explained . ]",
    "this suggest that the determinant in the background of the valley instanton can be well - evaluated by using the instanton .",
    "if the same approximation is used in the constrained instanton , the errors are increased .",
    "finally we will discuss the implication to the baryon and lepton number violating process in the standard model .",
    "it is expected that the process at high energy is dominated by the one containing many bosons in the process @xcite . using the constrained instanton with a small radius",
    ", the cross section of the process @xmath327 , where w stands for @xmath328 and z boson and h for higgs boson , was calculated in refs.@xcite . in their calculation ,",
    "larger size instanton - like configurations become important as @xmath329 and @xmath330 increase .",
    "since the authors of refs.@xcite used the small size constrained instanton , their calculations break down when the number of bosons is large enough . in section [ sec : gh ] , we have revealed that the action of the constrained instanton begins to deviate from the one obtained analytically by the small size constrained instanton at @xmath331 .",
    "namely @xmath332 at @xmath333 . since the action @xmath105 appears as @xmath334 in the calculation , this gives a significant difference in the amplitude . in the standard model @xmath335",
    "is given by @xmath336 at the z boson mass scale .",
    "therefore , the differences become @xmath337 . using the result that the @xmath53 integral in the amplitude",
    "is dominated at @xmath338^{1/2}$ ] @xcite , it is found that the calculations in refs.@xcite break down at @xmath339 .    at the same time , the constrained instanton deviates from the valley instanton .",
    "therefore at @xmath340 , the valley instanton is needed to obtain the plausible result of the amplitude .",
    "if we adopt the valley instanton , it is possible to perform the calculation of the amplitude including more gauge or higgs bosons .",
    "the most difficult part of the calculation is the evaluation of the determinant resulted from the gaussian integration .",
    "however , as was mentioned above , the determinant resulted from the gaussian integration can be well - evaluated in the valley instanton even when @xmath324 , which is relevant to the calculation for @xmath325 .",
    "residue of the pole at @xmath341 in the higgs field and that at @xmath342 in @xmath343 and @xmath344 fields , which are needed in the calculation of the amplitude , can be calculated numerically .",
    "as has been shown in subsection [ sec : fermion ] , incorporation of the light fermions into the su(2 ) gauge - higgs system is straightforward even when the radius of the valley instanton is large . for heavy fermion like top quark , the fermionic zero mode around the valley instanton can be constructed numerically .",
    "the analysis is in progress and will be reported in the near future .",
