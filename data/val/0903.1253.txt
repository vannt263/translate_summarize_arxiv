    "the behavior of fluidized granular systems resembles in many cases that of ordinary molecular fluids .",
    "actually , it is by now well established that generalized navier - stokes equations describe quite accurately many of the experimental and numerical features of granular flows , especially at low density and small inelasticity @xcite .",
    "the justification for this fluid - like description , and derivation of theoretical predictions for the transport coefficients appearing in the equations , have been intensively studied for some time . quite often , idealized systems of inelastic hard spheres or disks have been considered . for mono - disperse models of this kind ,",
    "the studies carried out include the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations to navier - stokes order by using kinetic theory methods @xcite , direct monte carlo simulation of ( inelastic ) kinetic equations @xcite , molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , and , very recently , linear response theory @xcite .",
    "interactions between grains are inherently inelastic . as a consequence ,",
    "the kinetic energy of isolated granular systems decreases monotonically in time and , in order to keep them fluidized , it is necessary to continuously supply energy to them . a prototypical way of doing it is by vibrating one of the walls of the container , usually the one at the bottom . also often , the interest focuses on the bulk properties of the system , i.e. on the behavior of the system far enough from the walls , where the governing laws are expected to be independent of the details of the boundaries .",
    "then , the most appropriate possible way of vibration for this purpose is chosen . in many situations of interest , the criterium for this choice is twofold : simplicity and avoiding undesired effects such as the induction of propagating waves into the system .",
    "these goals are formally achieved in the limits of very high frequency and very small amplitude ; the former as compared with the typical relaxation frequency of the granular fluid next to the wall , and the latter with its mean free path .",
    "additional simplifications occur if collisions of the grains with the wall are taken as elastic and if the wall is assumed to move with a sawtooth profile @xcite .    a kind of idealized walls often used in kinetic theory and particle simulations are the so - called thermal walls . by definition ,",
    "the flux of after - collision particles leaving it corresponds to a maxwellian flux with the temperature parameter characterizing the wall @xcite .",
    "therefore , the shape of the velocity distribution of the particles moving away from the thermal wall is independent of the distribution of the ingoing particles .",
    "it is evident that thermal walls also provide a mechanism to compensate the energy dissipated in inelastic collisions , once the granular gas in the vicinity of the wall tends to have a temperature smaller than the one of the wall .",
    "it is then not surprising that thermal walls have also been extensively used in the literature of fluidized granular gases since a decade ago @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it must be stressed that it is not at all evident that thermal walls correspond to any limit of a rapidly vibrating plate .",
    "actually , it has been shown that in some cases the stability of systems driven by a thermal wall and by a wall vibrating in a sawtooth way can differ @xcite .",
    "the granular system considered in this paper is confined between two parallel plates in presence of a gravity force .",
    "the mission of the one at the bottom of the system is to fluidize the granular medium , as in the previous studies mentioned above . on the other hand ,",
    "the wall on the top is floating , in the sense that it can move in the vertical direction , being supported by the granular fluid below it . as a consequence ,",
    "the position and motion of the upper wall is interrelated with the state of the granular media below it , and the boundary conditions to be imposed to the hydrodynamic equations , following from the interaction between the gas and the piston , must be determined in a self - consistent way . here",
    ", the steady state eventually reached by the granular gas between the two plates will be investigated , using the hydrodynamic description provided by the navier - stokes equations for inelastic hard spheres .",
    "collisions of the grains with the piston will be modeled as hard inelastic collisions .",
    "this defines in a deterministic way the mechanical interaction between the particles and the movable wall .",
    "the question addressed afterwards is how to translate it into an appropriate boundary condition to be used in the context of hydrodynamics . here",
    "this will be done by means of an intermediate stage in which an exact boundary condition for the kinetic theory description of the system is formulated .",
    "this condition relates the distribution functions of particles leaving the wall and approaching it , by expressing the conservation of the particles flux at the piston .",
    "an additional boundary conditions is required to determine the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "it can be obtained , in equivalent ways , from the energy flux at the vibrating bottom wall or from the global balance of energy in the system . in this way",
    ", the theoretical prediction is completed , and explicit expressions for the fields with no adjustable parameters are derived . in order to verify the accuracy of this description , the predictions are compared with molecular dynamics simulation results . as in other steady states of granular gases , the range of applicability of the theory is restricted to values of the restitution coefficient for gas particles collisions close to unity , because of the coupling between inelasticity and gradients . under these conditions ,",
    "reasonable agreement between theory and simulations is observed in the bulk of the system , i.e. outside the kinetic boundary layers next to the walls .",
    "this confirms the validity of the hydrodynamic description , including the needed boundary conditions , to describe vibrated granular gases in quite realistic situations .",

    "[ s2 ] , a previously derived @xcite stationary solution of the inelastic navier - stokes equations for a vibrated dilute granular system in presence of gravity is reviewed .",

    "they only depend on the restitution coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) shows the physically evident feature that , in this state , hydrodynamic gradients are induced by the inelasticity , through the cooling rate .",
    "consequently , a restriction to small gradients , as it is the case in the navier - stokes approximation used above , also implies a limitation on the value of @xmath8 for which the theory can be expected to apply .",

    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "in order to maintain the system fluidized , it will be assumed that energy is being continuously supplied to it through the wall located at the bottom , and that this is achieved by vibrating it .",
    "the simplest possible way of vibration will be considered here , namely with a sawtooth velocity profile .",
    "this means that all the particles colliding with the wall find it with the same upwards velocity @xmath63 @xcite .",

    ", the position of the wall can be taken in practice as fixed at @xmath37 with very good accuracy .",
    "finally , since the main reason to introduce this vibrating wall is to keep the granular matter fluidized , collisions of particles with it will be considered as elastic , for the sake of simplicity .",

    "when a particle with a component @xmath72 of the velocity collides with the piston being @xmath67 the velocity of the latter , these values change instantaneously to @xmath73 @xmath74 therefore , in the collision the total momentum is conserved , the relative velocity @xmath75 changes to @xmath76 , and there is a variation of the total kinetic energy given by @xmath77 for @xmath78 there is a loss of energy in every collision between a particle and the piston . the change in the @xmath13-component of the momentum",
