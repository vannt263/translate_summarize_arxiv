    "the big bang scenario implies that in the first micro - seconds of the universe the entire state has emerged from a partonic system of quarks , antiquarks and gluons  a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  to color neutral hadronic matter consisting of interacting hadronic states ( and resonances ) in which the partonic degrees of freedom are confined .",
    "the nature of confinement and the dynamics of this phase transition has motivated a large community for several decades and is still an outstanding question of todays physics .",
    "early concepts of the qgp were guided by the idea of a weakly interacting system of partons which might be described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "however , experimental observations at the relativistic - heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) indicated that the new medium created in ultrarelativistic au+au collisions was interacting more strongly than hadronic matter and consequently this concept had to be given up .",
    "moreover , in line with theoretical studies in refs .",
    "@xcite the medium showed phenomena of an almost perfect liquid of partons @xcite as extracted from the strong radial expansion and elliptic flow of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the question about the properties of this ( nonperturbative ) qgp liquid is discussed controversially in the literature and dynamical concepts describing the formation of color neutral hadrons from partons are scarce @xcite .",
    "a fundamental issue for hadronization models is the conservation of 4-momentum as well as the entropy problem because by fusion / coalescence of massless ( or low constituent mass ) partons to color neutral bound states of low invariant mass ( e.g. pions ) the number of degrees of freedom and thus the total entropy is reduced in the hadronization process @xcite .",
    "this problem - a violation of the second law of thermodynamics as well as of the conservation of four - momentum and flavor currents - definitely needs a sound dynamical solution .",
    "a consistent dynamical approach - valid also for strongly interacting systems - can be formulated on the basis of kadanoff - baym ( kb ) equations @xcite or off - shell transport equations in phase - space representation , respectively @xcite . in the kb theory",
    "the field quanta are described in terms of propagators with complex selfenergies . whereas the real part of the selfenergies can be related to mean - field potentials , the imaginary parts provide information about the lifetime and/or reaction rates of time - like particles @xcite .",
    "once the proper ( complex ) selfenergies of the degrees of freedom are known the time evolution of the system is fully governed by off - shell transport equations ( as described in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the determination / extraction of complex selfenergies for the partonic degrees of freedom has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite by fitting lattice qcd ( lqcd ) data within the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) .",
    "in fact , the dqpm allows for a simple and transparent interpretation of lattice qcd results for thermodynamic quantities as well as correlators and leads to effective strongly interacting partonic quasiparticles with broad spectral functions .",
    "the parton - hadron - string - dynamics ( phsd ) approach is a microscopic covariant transport model that incorporates effective partonic as well as hadronic degrees of freedom and involves a dynamical description of the hadronization process from partonic to hadronic matter @xcite . whereas the hadronic part is essentially equivalent to the conventional hadron - strings - dynamics ( hsd ) approach @xcite the partonic dynamics",
    "is based on the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) @xcite which describes qcd properties in terms of single - particle green s functions ( in the sense of a two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) approach ) .",
    "we briefly recall the basic assumptions of the dqpm : following ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamical quasiparticle mass ( for gluons and quarks ) is assumed to be given by the thermal mass in the asymptotic high - momentum regime , which is proportional to the coupling @xmath5 and the temperature @xmath6 with a running coupling ( squared ) , @xmath7\\ .",

    "the parameters controlling the infrared enhancement of the coupling @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been fitted in @xcite to lqcd results for the entropy density @xmath12 .",
    "an almost perfect reproduction of the energy density @xmath13 and the pressure @xmath14 from lqcd is achieved as well .",
    "the width for gluons and quarks ( for vanishing chemical potential @xmath15 ) is adopted in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) is related to a magnetic cut - off .",
    "we stress that a non - vanishing width @xmath18 is the central difference of the dqpm to conventional quasiparticle models @xcite .",
    "it influence is essentially seen in correlation functions as e.g. in the stationary limit of the correlation function in the off - diagonal elements of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath19 which defines the shear viscosity @xmath20 of the medium @xcite . here",
    "a sizable width is mandatory to obtain a small ratio in the shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath21 .    in line with @xcite",
    "the parton spectral functions thus are no longer @xmath22 functions in the invariant mass squared but taken as @xmath23 separately for quarks and gluons ( @xmath24 ) . with the convention @xmath25 , the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are directly related to the real and imaginary parts of the retarded self - energy , e.g. @xmath28 . with the spectral functions fixed by eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) the total energy density in the dqpm ( at vanishing quark chemical potential ) can be evaluated as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the bose and fermi functions , respectively .",
    "the number of transverse gluonic degrees of freedom is @xmath32 while the fermic degrees of freedom amount to @xmath33 in case of three flavors ( @xmath9=3 ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath34 then may be obtained by integrating the differential thermodynamic relation @xmath35 with the entropy density @xmath36 given by @xmath37 this approach is thermodynamically consistent and represents a 2pi approximation to hot qcd ( once the free parameters in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are fitted to lattice qcd results as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    as outlined in detail in refs . @xcite the energy density functional ( [ ener ] ) can be separated in space - like and time - like sectors when the spectral functions aquire a finite width .",
