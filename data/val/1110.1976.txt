    "network provides a powerful tool for representing the structure of complex systems .",
    "these networks include social networks  @xcite , information networks  @xcite , and biological networks  @xcite .",
    "much of recent research on networks actually aims to understand the structural regularities and further to reveal the relationship between such structural regularities and the function of networks .",
    "for example , as a widely - studied structural characteristic of network , community structure is of high interest because communities often correspond to functional units such as pathways for metabolic networks and collections of pages on a similar topic on the web .    community structure is a kind of assortative structure , in which nodes are divided into groups such that the members within each group are mostly connected with each other .",
    "contrary to community structure , multipartite structure is another important kind of structural regularities observed in real world networks .",
    "multipartite structure means that nodes of network can be divided into groups such that most of edges are across groups . beside these salient structural characteristics , other types of structure",
    "are also observed in real world networks , such as hierarchical structure and core - periphery structure .",
    "however , existing methods mostly presume that certain type of structure exists in the target network and then devote to detect such structure .",
    "this raises concerns to the reliability of the resulted structure . on one hand",
    ", the assumed structure may not match the intrinsic structure of the target network and thus these methods are not applicable to these situations . on the other hand ,",
    "several real world networks contain multiple types of structure simultaneously .",
    "most existing methods are designed for certain type of structure and thus can not detect the broad types of structure .",
    "in addition , several unknown types of structure may also exist in networks and a desired method should be able to detect such structure as well .",
    "thus , it is the time to explore multiple types of structural regularities in networks .    in the last decade , the identification of community structure has attracted much attention in various scientific fields .",
    "many methods have been proposed and applied successfully to some specific complex networks  @xcite . for review , the reader can refer to ref .",
    "these methods are from different perspectives , such as the centrality measures , modularity , link density , percolation theory , network compression , and spectral analysis .",
    "recently , several generative models for network data are proposed to detect community structure  @xcite .",
    "these models view network structure as observed quantities and take communities as hidden groups of nodes .",
    "the communities are then identified by fitting the model to the observed network structure .",
    "for example , ren _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a probabilistic model to uncover the overlapping community structure .",
    "this model assumes that the two end nodes of each edge are from the same community and this assumption is satisfied by the fuzzy membership of nodes .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite applied the latent dirichlet allocation ( lda , a well - known generative model ) to social network analysis and gave a method to detect community structure .",
    "the common drawback of these two models is that they can only uncover the community structure and fail to reveal other types of structural regularities , e.g. , multipartite structure .    to characterize the hierarchical organization of networks ,",
    "clauset  _ et al .",
    "_ proposed the hierarchical random graph model , which is capable of expressing both assortative and disassortative structure  @xcite . to explore more broad types of structure , newman _",
    "proposed a mixture model for exploratory analysis of network structure  @xcite . in this model , the nodes with similar connection preference rather than the highly connected nodes are classified into the same group . in such a general way",
    ", this model can reveal several other kinds of structural regularities beyond community structure .",
    "however , this model fails to tell us which kind of structural regularities has been identified .",
    "more importantly , this model may produce a result which is a mixture of several types of structure , and thus the identified structure may not provide clear information about the structural regularities .",
    "the shortcoming of this model is attributed to that it only models the relationship between groups and nodes rather than the relationship among groups .",
    "stochastic blockmodel provides an appropriate alternative to the mixture model for exploring broad range of structural regularities .",
    "utilized a degree - corrected stochastic blockmodel  @xcite to investigate community structure of network .",
    "_ gave a mixed membership stochastic blockmodel  @xcite to model network data .",
    "these work has demonstrated that stochastic blockmodel is a good choice for exploring regularities of network .",
    "however , the effectiveness of these models are limited by their inflexible model assumptions , e.g. , the hard partition assumption or neglecting the directionality of edges .    in this paper , we focus on exploring the intrinsic structural regularities in network by dividing network nodes into groups such that the members of each group have similar patterns of connections to other groups .",
    "we propose a general stochastic blockmodel ( referred to as gsb model in this paper ) to model the network structure . in this model ,",
    "node groups are represented by unobserved or hidden quantities and the relationship among groups are explicitly modeled by a block matrix as the traditional blockmodels .",
    "then , using the expectation - maximization algorithm , we fit the model to specific network data and thus detect intrinsic structural regularities of the network without prior knowledge of what type of regularity exists in the network . compared with existing models ,",
    "the most prominent strength of our model is the high flexibility .",
    "this strength enables it to possess the advantages of existing models and overcomes their shortcomings in a unified way . as a result ,",
    "not only broad types of structure can be detected , but also the type of identified structure can be indicated by the block matrix . in addition , our model can tell us the centrality of the node in each group and the mixed membership of nodes as well .",
    "tests on a number of artificial and real world networks demonstrate that our model outperforms the state - of - the - art models at shedding light on the structural features of networks , including the overlapping community structure , multipartite structure and several other types of structure which is beyond the capability of existing models .",
    "generally , a network with @xmath0 nodes can be represented mathematically by an adjacency matrix @xmath1 with elements @xmath2 if there is an edge from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 and @xmath5 otherwise . for weighted networks , @xmath6 is generalized to represent the weight of the edge from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .    to investigate the structural regularities in network",
    ", we suppose that the @xmath0 nodes of the network fall into @xmath7 groups whose memberships are unknown , i.e. , we can not observe or measure them directly . in this paper , we propose a statistical model to infer the group membership from the observed network structure .",
    "the model we used is a kind of stochastic blockmodel .",
    "blockmodel is a generative model and has a long tradition of study in the social science and computer science . for a standard blockmodel , a @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 is generally adopted such that the matrix element @xmath10 denotes the probability that a randomly selected edge connects group @xmath11 to group @xmath12 , i.e.",
    ", the tail node of the edge is from group @xmath11 and the head node is from @xmath12 .",
    "the advantage of blockmodel lies in that the matrix @xmath9 explicitly characterizes various types of connecting patterns among groups .    in the standard blockmodel ,",
    "the nodes in the same group are identical , i.e. , each node in a group has equal probability to be the end node of an edge adjacent to the group .",
    "this constraint is relaxed in our model .",
    "specifically , for an edge with its tail node being from group @xmath11 and its head node being from group @xmath12 , we use @xmath13 to denote the probability that the tail node is @xmath3 and @xmath14 to denote the probability that the head node is @xmath4 respectively .",
    "in addition , we use @xmath15 and @xmath16 to denote respectively the group membership of the tail node and head node of the edge @xmath17 .    up to now , we have given all the quantities in our model .",
    "they can be classified into three classes : observed quantities @xmath18 , hidden quantities @xmath19 , and model parameters @xmath20 . to simplify the notations ,",
    "we henceforth denote by @xmath1 the entire set @xmath18 and similarly @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath9 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    with our model , an edge @xmath17",
    "is generated in the following process :    1 .",
    "select two groups @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively for the tail node and head node of the edge with probability @xmath10 ; 2 .",
    "draw the tail node @xmath3 from the group @xmath11 with probability @xmath13 ; 3 .",
    "draw the head node @xmath4 from the group @xmath12 with probability @xmath14 .",
    "summing over the latent quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the probability that we observe an edge @xmath17 can be written as @xmath32    then , the likelihood of the observed network with respect to our model is @xmath33 note that the self - loop edges are allowed and the weight @xmath6 is taken as the number of multi - edges connecting node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 as done in many existing models including , for instance , the widely studied configuration model  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the parameter @xmath13 characterizes the centrality of node @xmath3 in the group @xmath11 from the perspective of outgoing edges while @xmath14 describes the centrality of node @xmath4 in the group @xmath12 from the perspective of incoming edges . differently from traditional blockmodels , by differentiating these two kinds of centrality , our model can provide more flexibility to explore broad types of intrinsic structural regularities in network .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 satisfy the normalization conditions @xmath34    now our task is to estimate the model parameters and to infer the unobserved quantities by fitting the model to the observed network data .",
    "the standard framework for such a task is likelihood maximization .",
    "generally , one works not with the likelihood [ eq .  ( [ eq2 ] ) ] itself but with its logarithm ( log - likelihood ) @xmath35 the maximums of the likelihood and its logarithm are in the same place since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function .    directly maximizing",
    "the log - likelihood is difficult because of the inner sum over the unobserved quantities @xmath36 and @xmath37 . using jensen s inequality ,",
    "the maximization of the log - likelihood can be transformed to the maximization of the expected log - likelihood @xmath38 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{ijrs}{q_{ijrs}a_{ij}\\left(\\text{ln}\\omega_{rs}+\\text{ln}\\theta_{ri}+\\text{ln}\\phi_{sj}\\right)},\\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where to simplify the notation we have defined @xmath39 , which denotes the probability that one observes an edge @xmath17 with its tail node @xmath3 from group @xmath11 and its head node @xmath4 from group @xmath12 given the observed network and the model parameters .    with the expected log - likelihood",
    ", we can give the best estimate of the value @xmath40 and the position of its maximum represents the best estimate of the most likely values of the model parameters .",
    "specifically , if the value of @xmath41 is known , we can find the values of the model parameters @xmath9 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath40 reaches its maximum .",
    "however , the calculation of @xmath41 requires the values of these model parameters . to address such a problem , an expectation - maximization ( em )",
    "algorithm is adopted .    under the framework of em algorithm",
    ", we first calculate the value of @xmath41 by @xmath42 once we have the values of the @xmath41 , we can use them to evaluate the expected log - likelihood and hence to find the values of @xmath9 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 that maximize it .    introducing the lagrange multipliers",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 to incorporate the normalization conditions in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , the expected log - likelihood expression to be maximized becomes @xmath46    by letting the derivative of @xmath47 to be @xmath5 , the maximum of the expected log - likelihood occurs at the places where    @xmath48    eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) constitute our expectation - maximization algorithm . in the expectation step",
    ", the expected value of log - likelihood is calculated through evaluating the values of @xmath41 with eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . in the maximization step ,",
    "the expected value of log - likelihood is maximized when the values of model parameters @xmath9 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are evaluated with eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "implementation of the algorithm consists merely of iterating eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) until convergence .",
    "when the algorithm converges , we obtain a set of values for hidden quantity @xmath41 and model parameters @xmath9 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "this set of values is self - consistent with respect to eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) . however , it is not always the place where the log - likelihood reaches its maximum . in other words ,",
    "the expectation - maximization algorithm may converge to local maxima of the log - likelihood . with different starting values ,",
    "the algorithm will give rise to different solutions . to obtain a satisfactory solution ,",
    "it is necessary to perform several runs with different initial conditions and take the solution giving the highest log - likelihood over all the runs performed .    by fitting the model to the observed network structure with the expectation - maximization algorithm ,",
    "the estimated model parameters provide us vital information for structural regularities of the network .",
    "specifically , @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe the centrality of a node in groups containing it respectively from the perspective of outgoing edges and incoming edges .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 characterizes the connecting patterns among different groups , i.e. , the type of structural regularities .",
    "more importantly , according to the model parameters , we can define two kinds of group memberships @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively from the perspective of outgoing edges and incoming edges .",
    "specifically , @xmath49 is the probability that node @xmath3 is from group @xmath11 when it acts as the tail node of edges while @xmath50 is the probability that node @xmath4 is from group @xmath12 when it acts as the head node of edges . for @xmath49",
    ", it can be calculated by @xmath51 actually , @xmath49 provides a soft or fuzzy membership , i.e. , node @xmath3 can belong to more than one groups simultaneously .",
    "when the identified structural regularity corresponds to community structure , we actually obtain the overlapping community structure which has attracted much research attention ever since it is proposed .",
    "if one wants to get a hard partition , we can simply assign each node @xmath3 to the group @xmath11 satisfying @xmath52 .",
    "these statements for @xmath53 also apply to @xmath54 defined as @xmath55    finally , the model described above so far is based on directed networks .",
    "actually , the model can be easily generalized to undirected networks by letting the parameter @xmath23 be identical to @xmath24 .",
    "the derivation follows the case of directed networks and the results are the same to eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "now we discuss the computational cost of the expectation - maximization algorithm for the fitting of our model . for each iteration in this algorithm ,",
    "the cost consists in two parts .",
    "the first part is from the calculation of @xmath41 using eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , whose time - complexity is @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 is the edges in the network and @xmath7 is the number of groups .",
    "the second part is from the estimation of the model parameters using eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , whose time - complexity is also @xmath56 .",
    "we use @xmath58 to denote the number of iterations before the iteration process converges .",
    "then , the total cost of the expectation - maximization algorithm for our model is @xmath59 .",
    "it is difficult to give a theoretical estimation to the number @xmath58 of iterations . generally speaking ,",
    "@xmath58 is determined by the network structure and the initial condition .",
    "a well - designed initial condition may result in good convergence rate .",
    "the computational cost limits our model to deal with networks with moderate scale networks .",
    "we look forward to seeing more efficient implementation for our model .",
    "note that the method proposed in  @xcite provides a promising way to improve the computational efficiency and decrease the memory space required .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the difference and connections between our model with several existing models . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] gives the schematic for our model and two existing generative models , namely newman s mixture model and ren s model .     and",
    "@xmath4 indicates the existence of one ( directed ) edge connecting them .",
    "the dashed - line connecting two circles indicates that the relation between the corresponding quantities is unobserved and requires being learned from the observed network data .",
    "arrows represent the directions of relation.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    for newman s model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , each group @xmath11 is characterized by the connecting preference @xmath60 to node @xmath4 , no matter the node @xmath4 is contained by the group @xmath11 or not .",
    "the nodes belonging to the same group have similar connecting preference . as a result ,",
    "both assortative and disassortative structural regularities can be detected by this model .",
    "however , this model has no parameter to explicitly characterize the type of the identified structure .",
    "more importantly , this model may produce a result which is a mixture of several types of structure and thus in these cases the identified structure may provide confused information about the structural regularities .",
    "for example , for the network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , nodes @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are identified by this model as overlapped nodes shared by the two groups , denoted by circles and squares , although these nodes only have connections to one of the two groups .    for ren s model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the two end nodes of each edge is assumed to be from the same group . as a result ,",
    "only the assortative structure ( community ) can be detected using this model .",
    "note that , for this model , no edge is allowed to connect different groups .",
    "the relationship between communities is instead reflected by the overlapped nodes .     ranging from @xmath5 for the smallest nodes to @xmath67 for the largest.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    for our model , it essentially is a kind of stochastic blockmodel , in which the relationships among different node groups are explicitly modeled by the block matrix @xmath68 . in this way",
    ", our model possesses the advantages of both newman s model and ren s model and overcomes the shortcoming of these two models .    on one hand , through learning the matrix @xmath68 according to observed network data , various types of structural regularities can be explored by our model . the type of the identified structure is indicated by the matrix @xmath68 .",
    "specifically , when the matrix @xmath9 is an identity matrix , the identified structural regularity corresponds to an obvious community structure .",
    "meanwhile , multipartite or anti - community structure is revealed when the estimated model parameter @xmath9 is an anti - diagonal matrix with all the anti - diagonal elements being @xmath69 .",
    "for other types of structure such as core - periphery structure and hierarchical structure , the form of @xmath9 is the same to the block matrix @xmath9 in traditional block models  @xcite .    on the other hand , using the matrix @xmath68 , our model discards the assumption of ren s model that two end nodes of one edge are required to be from the same community . in this sense , ren s model is a special case of our model . in addition , our model also provides several other flexibility . by representing the centrality of nodes in group from two different perspective respectively according to the outgoing edges and incoming edges ,",
    "our model can detect more broad range of structural regularities which is out of the capability of other models .",
    "this will be shown later in the subsequent section . moreover , our model can be further generalized by not requiring the matrix @xmath68 be a square matrix .",
    "finally , we compare our model to two recently proposed stochastic models for community detection  @xcite .",
    "firstly , both our model and karrer s model  @xcite are stochastic block model where a block matrix is adopted to characterize the connecting patterns among groups .",
    "the main difference between these two models lies in that karrer s model is designed to detect disjoint structural regularities while our model is for fuzzy structural regularities .",
    "this difference is reflected by the definition of the model parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 in our model and the definition of the model parameter @xmath23 in karrer s model .",
    "in addition , our model differentiates the out - edges from in - edges of nodes while karrer s model does not .",
    "secondly , similar to ren s model , ball s model  @xcite focused on the community structure while our model can uncover multiple types of structural regularities .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model at exploring the structural regularities of networks by experiments on several real world or artificial networks with various types of intrinsic structural regularities . then we discuss the model selection issue , i.e. , how to determine the optimal number of groups .",
    "the test network is the famous karate club network constructed by zachary .",
    "this network characterizes the acquaintance relationship between @xmath70 members of a karate club in an american university .",
    "a dispute arose between the club s administrator and its principal karate teacher , and as a result the club eventually split into two smaller clubs , centered around the administrator and the teacher respectively .",
    "the network and its fission are depicted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the administrator and the teacher are represented by nodes @xmath69 and @xmath71 respectively .    by setting the group number @xmath72",
    ", we fit our model to the karate club network data .",
    "the resulted matrix @xmath9 is a @xmath73 identity matrix , indicating that the obtained structure is community structure .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the two groups found by our model with the expectation - maximization method . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the shades of the nodes in the figure represent the values of @xmath74 . ] , where group @xmath69 is the left group .",
    "as we can see , our model assigns most of the nodes strongly to one group or the other .",
    "actually , all but @xmath75 nodes are assigned @xmath76 to one of the groups ( black and white nodes in the figure ) . if we simply divide the nodes into two disjoint groups by assigning each node @xmath3 to the group @xmath11 according to the belong coefficients @xmath49 , the resulting groups perfectly correspond to the real split of the club .",
    "in addition , table  [ tab1 ] gives the belonging coefficient of the @xmath75 overlapped nodes which are shared by the two groups .",
    "these overlapped nodes are nodes @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "note that these overlapped nodes are often misclassified by traditional partition - based community detection methods . for comparison",
    ", we also gives the mixed membership of these six nodes according to newman s mixture model and ren s model .",
    "as we can see , our model and ren s model produce the same results , which is attributed to the fact that ren s model is a special case of our model .",
    "however , newman s model behave very differently from the other two models .",
    "actually , for newman s model , another @xmath83 nodes are also assigned to two groups , e.g. , nodes @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "such a result is counterintuitive to the real structure of this network . as a conclusion , our model performs better than newman s model at detecting the overlaps between groups .",
    "ren s model can only detect community structure while our model can detect other types of structural regularities as illustrated in the following test .",
    ".[tab1 ] mixed membership of overlapped nodes . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      now we illustrate the detection of multipartite or anti - community structure according to our model .",
    "the test network is the adjacency network of english words taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . in this network ,",
    "the nodes represent @xmath84 commonly occurring adjectives and nouns in the novel _ david copperfield _ by charles dickens , with edges connecting any pair of words that appear adjacent to each other at any place in the text .",
    "generally , adjectives occur next to nouns in english .",
    "thus most edges in the network connect an adjective to a noun and the network is approximately bipartite , i.e. , this network possesses anti - community structure .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the adjectives and nouns are respectively represented by circles and squares .    fitting our model to this network with @xmath72 , the resulted @xmath9 is a transposed @xmath73 identity matrix , indicating that the identified structure is bipartite structure .",
    "the obtained two groups and node memberships are shown by the shades of nodes as shown in fig .",
    "we can see that most nodes are assigned to only one group , although there are several ambiguous cases corresponding to the nodes with intermediate shades .",
    "if we assign each node to its most preferred group , the resulted two disjoint groups well separate the adjectives from the nouns .",
    "in fact , @xmath85 of all the @xmath84 nodes are correctly classified .",
    "this accuracy is the same to the result given by newman s mixture model .    as a comparison",
    ", we also apply ren s model to this network by setting the group number being @xmath86 .",
    "only @xmath87 nodes of all the @xmath84 nodes are correctly classified , similar to the accuracy of random assignment .",
    "the ineffectiveness of ren s model at this network is attributed to that ren s model presumes the existence of community structure in the network while the intrinsic structural regularity is bipartite structure .          in the previous tests , we have demonstrate that our model can be used to detect both the assortative structure ( i.e. , community structure ) and the disassortative structure ( i.e. , multipartite structure ) without being told that which type of structural regularities exists in the target networks .",
    "now we will further show that our model can also detect other type of structure which can not be revealed by competing models .",
    "we consider the schematic network depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "intuitively , according to the outgoing edges in this network , the nodes can be divided into two groups : @xmath88 and @xmath89 . meanwhile , according to the incoming edges , the nodes of this network belong to another two groups : @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we apply newman s model , ren s model and our model to this schematic network . limited by the assumptions of models , both newman s model and ren s model",
    "fail to uncover the intrinsic structural regularity according the construction rules . for our model ,",

    "the directed edges are placed according to the rules described the right table.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ] +      in the previous tests , we need to specify the group number before fitting our model to network . however , the group number is unknown a prior for many cases .",
    "thus it is helpful to give a criterion to determinate the appropriate group number for given network .",
    "this task is known as the model selection issue in statistics .",
    "we deal with this problem by using minimum description length principle , which is also used to handle the model selection issue in ren s model .    according to minimum description length principle , the required length to describe the network data",
    "is composed of two parts .",
    "the first part describes the coding length of the network using our model .",
    "this coding length is @xmath92 for directed network and @xmath93 for undirected network .",
    "the second part gives the length for coding model parameters .",
    "this part is @xmath94 for directed network and @xmath95 for undirected network . in this way ,",
    "the optimal @xmath7 is the one which minimizes the total description length .    as tests , we consider two real world networks with prior knowledge of the intrinsic group numbers .",
    "these two networks are respectively the journal citation network constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the american football team network described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the journal citation network",
    ", each node corresponds to a journal and all the @xmath96 journals are from four different fields : multidisciplinary physics , chemistry , biology and ecology .",
    "journals from the same field are more likely connected by citation relation . for the football network , nodes represent the @xmath97 teams respectively belonging to @xmath61 conference and generally games are more frequent between members of the same conference than between teams of different conferences .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the number of intrinsic groups is correctly identified for the journal citation network .",
    "however , for the football network , @xmath98 is the optimal number of groups while the intrinsic number is @xmath61 . by checking the found node groups , we find that only @xmath98 node groups have their identities , i.e. , each group contains at least one node after assigning nodes to their most preferred groups according to the obtained belonging coefficient @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "this indicates that the appropriate group number is @xmath98 for the football network .",

    "<S> group is viewed as hidden or unobserved quantity and it is learned by fitting the observed network data using the expectation - maximization algorithm . compared with existing models , the most prominent strength of our model is the high flexibility . </S>",
    "<S> this strength enables it to possess the advantages of existing models and overcomes their shortcomings in a unified way . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> not only broad types of structure can be detected without prior knowledge of what type of intrinsic regularities exist in the network , but also the type of identified structure can be directly learned from data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by differentiating outgoing edges from incoming edges , our model can detect several types of structural regularities beyond competing models . </S>",
    "<S> tests on a number of real world and artificial networks demonstrate that our model outperforms the state - of - the - art model at shedding light on the structural features of networks , including the overlapping community structure , multipartite structure and several other types of structure which are beyond the capability of existing models . </S>"
