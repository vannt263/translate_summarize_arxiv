    "many systems out of equilibrium @xcite exhibit spatial striped patterns on macroscopic scales .",
    "these are often caused by transport of matter or charge induced by a drive which leads to heterogeneous ordering .",
    "such phenomenology occurs in flowing fluids @xcite , and during phase separation in colloidal @xcite , granular reis , sanchez , and liquid  liquid @xcite mixtures .",
    "further examples are wind ripples in sand @xcite , trails by animals and pedestrians @xcite , and the anisotropies observed in high temperature superconductors @xcite and in two  dimensional electron gases @xcite",
    ".    studies of these situations , often described as nonequilibrium phase transitions , have generally focused on lattice systems @xcite , i.e. , models based on a discretization of space and in considering interacting particles that move according to simple local rules .",
    "such simplicity sometimes allows for exact calculations and is easy to be implemented in a computer .",
    "moreover , some powerful techniques have been developed to deal with these situations , including nonequilibrium statistical field theory . however , lattice models are perhaps a too crude oversimplification of fluid systems so that the robustness of such an approach merits a detailed study .",
    "the present paper describes monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and field theoretical calculations that aim at illustrating how slight modifications of dynamics at the microscopic level may influence , even quantitatively , the resulting ( nonequilibrium ) steady state .",
    "we are also , in particular concerned with the influence of dynamics on criticality . with this objective ,",
    "we take as a reference the _ driven lattice gas _ ( dlg ) , namely , a kinetic nonequilibrium ising model with conserved dynamics .",
    "this system has become a prototype for anisotropic behavior , and it has been useful to model , for instance , ionic currents @xcite and traffic flows @xcite .",
    "in fact , in certain aspects , this model is more realistic for traffic flows than the standard _",
    "asymmetric simple exclusion process _",
    "here we compare the transport and critical properties of the dlg with those for apparently close lattice and off  lattice models .",
    "there is some related previous work addressing the issue of how minor variations in the dynamics may induce dramatic morphological changes both in the early time kinetics and in the stationary state @xcite .",
    "however , these papers do not focus on transport nor on critical properties .",
    "we here in particular investigate the question of how the lattice itself may condition transport , structural and critical properties and , with this aim , we consider nearest  neighbor ( nn ) and next  nearest  neighbor ( nnn ) interactions . we also compare with a microscopically off  lattice representation of the _ driven lattice gas _ in which the particles spatial coordinates vary continuously .",
    "a principal conclusion is that spatial discretization may change significantly not only morphological and early  time kinetics properties , but also critical properties .",
    "this is in contrast with the concept of universality in equilibrium systems , where critical properties are independent of dynamic details .",
    "horizontal field ( right ) .",

    "hole exchange between neighbors is either forbidden ( @xmath0 ) or allowed ( @xmath1 ) , depending on the field value . ]",
    "the _ driven lattice gas _ , initially proposed by katz , lebowitz , and spohn @xcite , is a nonequilibrium extension of the ising model with conserved dynamics .",
    "the dlg consists of a _",
    "d_-dimensional square lattice gas in which pair of particles interact via an attractive and short  range ising  like hamiltonian ,    @xmath2    here @xmath3 is the lattice occupation number at site @xmath4 for an empty ( occupied ) state and the sum runs over all the nn sites ( the accessible sites are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "dynamics is induced by the competion between a heat bath at temperature @xmath5 and an external driving field @xmath6 which favors particle hops along one of the principal lattice directions , say horizontally ( @xmath7 ) , as if the particles were positively charged .",
    "consequently , for periodic boundary conditions , a nontrivial nonequilibrium steady state is set in asymptotically .",
    "mc simulations by a biased _ metropolis _ rate reveal that , as in equilibrium , the dlg undergoes a second order phase transition . at high enough temperature ,",
    "the system is in a disordered state while , below a critical point ( at @xmath8 ) it orders displaying anisotropic phase segregation . that is , an anisotropic ( striped for @xmath9 ) rich  particle phase then coexists with its gas .",
    "it is also found that the critical temperature @xmath10 monotonically increases with @xmath6 . more specifically , for @xmath9 , assuming a half filled square lattice in the large field limit ( in order to maximize the nonequilibrium effect ) , one has a _ nonequilibrium _ critical point at @xmath11 , where the equilibrium value is @xmath12 .",
    "it was numerically shown that this belongs to a universality class other than the onsager one , e.g. , mc data indicates that the order parameter critical exponent is @xmath13 @xcite ( instead of the onsager value @xmath14 ) .     half filled lattice .",

    "[ fig2 ] , correlations are favored ( inhibited ) along ( against ) the field direction .",
    "in fact , the dlg shows a slow decay of the two  point correlations due to the spatial anisotropy associated with the dynamics @xcite .",
    "this long range behavior translates into a characteristic discontinuity singularity at the origin ( @xmath20 ) in the structure factor @xcite , which is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "how do all these features depend on the number of neighbor sites to which a particle can hop ? or in other words , how robust is the behavior when extending interactions and accessible sites to the nnn ?",
    "previous work has shown that extending hopping in the dlg to nnn leads to an inversion of triangular anisotropies during the formation of clusters @xcite , and also that dramatic changes occur in the steady state , including the fact that , contrary to the dlg with nn interactions , the critical temperature decreases with increasing @xmath6 @xcite . however , other important features such as correlations and criticality seem to remain invariant .",
    "analysis of the parallel ( @xmath16 ) and transverse ( @xmath21 ) components reveals that correlations are quantitatively similar for the dlg and for the dlg with nnn interactions ( henceforth ndlg ) although somehow weaker for the latter case .",
    "also persists a slow decay of correlations which yield to the discontinuity at the origin of @xmath22 .",
    "these facts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , recent mc simulations of the ndlg indicate that the order parameter critical exponent is @xmath23 @xcite , as for the dlg .",
    "the _ anisotropic diffusive system _",
    "approach @xcite , which is a langevin  type ( mesoscopic ) description , predicts this critical behavior . in both cases , dlg and ndlg , the langevin equations , as derived by coarse graining the master equation ,",
    "lead to @xmath24 .",
    "these two langevin equations are identical , except for new entropic terms in the ndlg due to the presence of additional neighbors @xcite .    the fact that extending particle hops and interaction to the diagonal sites leaves invariant both correlations and criticality seems to indicate that the two systems , dlg and ndlg , belong to the same universality class .",
    "in order to deep further on this interesting issue , we studied to what extent the dlg behavior depends on the lattice itself . with this aim",
    ", we considered a driven system with continuous variation of the particles spatial coordinates instead of the discrete variations in the dlg which follows as close as possible the dlg strategy . in particular , we analyzed an off  lattice , microscopically ",

    "the most relevant information is carried by the transverse  to  the  field current profile @xmath59 , which shows the differences between the two coexisting phases ( right graph in fig .",

    "the current and the density vary in a strongly correlated manner : the high current phase corresponds to the condensed ( high density ) phase , whereas the low current phase corresponds to the vapor ( low density ) phase .",
    "this is expectable due to the fact that there are many carriers in the condensed phase which allow for higher current than in the vapor phase .",
    "however , the mobility of the carriers is much larger in the vapor phase .",
    "the maximal current occurs in the interface , where there is still a considerable amount of carriers but they are less bounded than in the particles well inside the _ bulk _ and , therefore , the field drives easily those particles .",
    "this enhanced current effect along the interface is more prominent in the lattice models ( notice the large peak in the current profile in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",

    "[ fig5 ] . at high enough temperature above the critical temperature",
    "the local density is roughly constant around the mean system density ( @xmath62 in fig .",

    "the same behavior is obtained from the transversal current profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the estimate of the coexisting densities @xmath68 is favored by the existence of a linear interface , which is simpler here than in equilibrium .",
    "this is remarkable because we can therefore get closer to the critical point than in equilibrium .",
    "lacking a _ thermodynamic _",
    "theory for phase transitions@xmath69 in non  equilibrium liquids , other approaches have to be considered in order to estimate the critical parameters .",

    "this , in principle , has no justification out of equilibrium .",
    "however , we found that our mc data nicely fit the diameters equation .",
    "we use this fact together with a universal scaling law @xmath71 to accurately estimate the critical parameters . the simulation data in fig .",

    "these values are confirmed by the familiar log  log plots .",
    "compared to the equilibrium case @xcite , one has that @xmath75 .",
    "this confirms the intuitive observation above that the field acts in this system favoring disorder . on the other hand , our estimate for the order ",
    "parameter critical exponent is fully consistent with both the extremely flat coexistence curve which characterizes the equilibrium two  dimensional lj fluids and the equilibrium ising value , @xmath76 ( non  mean  field value ) .",
    "although the error bar is large , one may discard with confidence the dlg value @xmath77 as well as the mean field value .",
    "this result is striking because our model _ seems _ to have the symmetries and short  range interactions of the dlg .",
    "further understanding for this difference will perhaps come from the statistical field theory .",
    "in summary , we reported mc simulations and field theoretical calculations to study the effect of discretization in _ driven diffusive systems _ in particular , we studied structural , transport , and critical properties on the _ driven lattice gas _ and related non  equilibrium lattice and off  lattice models .",
    "interestingly , the present _ lennard  jones _ model in which particles are subject to a constant driving field is a computationally convenient prototypical model for anisotropic behavior , and reduces to the familiar lj case for zero field .",
    "otherwise , it exhibits some arresting behavior , including currents and striped patterns , as many systems in nature .",
    "we have shown that the additional spatial freedom that our fluid model possesses , compared with its lattice counterpart , is likely to matter more than suggested by some naive intuition .",
    "in fact , it is surprising that its critical behavior is consistent with the one for the ising equilibrium model but not with the one for the _ driven lattice gas_. the main reason for this disagreement might be the particle  hole symmetry violation in the driven _ lennard  jones _ fluid .",
    "however , to determine exactly this statement will require further study .",
    "it also seems to be implied that neither the current nor the inherent anisotropy are the most relevant feature ( at least regarding criticality ) in these driven systems .",
    "indeed , the question of what are the most relevant ingredients and symmetries which determine unambiguously the universal properties in driven diffusive systems is still open . in any case , the above important difference between the lattice and the off  lattice cases results most interesting as an unquestionable nonequilibrium effect ; as it is well known , such microscopic detail is irrelevant to universality concerning equilibrium critical phenomena .",
