    "explicit relations between thermodynamical and microscopical quantities and derivation of the laws of thermodynamics from microscopic theory have attracted attention of physics community for a long time  @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges is finding the correct microscopic definition of the entropy .",
    "while it is established that the von neumann entropy @xmath4 accurately describes equilibrium statistical ensembles , it clearly disagrees with the second law of thermodynamics because for isolated systems it is conserved in time for any processes  @xcite .",
    "this entropy also does not satisfy the fundamental thermodynamic relation , which relies on uniqueness of the entropy as a function of energy , unless one makes an additional assumption that the density matrix always remains diagonal .",
    "it is well understood that the thermodynamic entropy of a closed system obtained from the von neumann entropy,,which can also serve as a measure of information in the system , by coarse - graining increases with time ( see e.g. refs .",
    "if properly defined coarse - graining can lead to correct predictions in complex systems subject to dynamical processes ( see e.g. refs .",
    "also it can be shown that the von neumann s entropy behavior is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics in open systems  @xcite .",
    "yet the whole situation that on top of the microscopic description one needs to introduce a non - uniquely defined coarse - graining procedure , which is not part of the hamiltonian dynamics , is not satisfactory .",
    "microscopic description of thermodynamics using the von neumann entropy is problematic on several other reasons .",
    "for example , consider a sufficiently complex system that was subject to a process which started and ended in a distant past , and eventually achieved some steady state . by the ergodic hypothesis time average of any thermodynamic observable",
    "should be equivalent to the equilibrium ensemble average . for any observable @xmath5 , assuming that the spectrum is non - degenerate or that degeneracies are not important , its time average can be written as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the time - independent diagonal elements of the density matrix in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian and @xmath8 are the diagonal matrix elements of the operator @xmath5 .",
    "all information about arbitrary time - averaged observables and thus about the steady state is contained in diagonal elements of @xmath9 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more discussion ) . at the same time",
    "the von neumann entropy explicitly depends on the nonlinear combination of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , which do not average to zero .",
    "so we have the situation that ( i ) the von neumann entropy contains additional information , which does not appear in any thermodynamic measurement and ( ii ) its time average is different from the entropy of the equilibrium ensemble .",
    "there is another important indication that the entropy should be sensitive only to the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath10 .",
    "it follows from the basic thermodynamics that in adiabatic processes the entropy of the system does not change  @xcite . at the same time",
    "the slow changes in the hamiltonian do not induce transitions between instantaneous energy levels  @xcite , which implies that diagonal elements of the density matrix ( and only they ) do not change in time .",
    "we note that it is practically impossible to completely avoid transitions between energy levels in macroscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "the proper adiabatic limit , therefore , should be defined as such when the heat ( or excess energy ) generated during a dynamical process is small . in turn heating of the system",
    "is related to the transitions between different instantaneous energy levels  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic adiabatic limit emerges as a result of shrinking phase space available for the transitions between instantaneous energy levels as the process becomes slower .",
    "thus the heating is again sensitive only to the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , one can rigorously prove that for unitary evolution this heating is non - negative for any cyclic process ( and under very generic assumptions for noncyclic processes ) as long as the initial density matrix satisfies the conditions of passivity : it is stationary ( diagonal ) and monotonically decreasing function of energy  @xcite .",
    "this statement actually coincides with the second law of thermodynamics in the kelvin s form  @xcite .",
    "if the second law of thermodynamics is established from microscopics in one formulation , it should also follow from microscopics in other formulations involving entropy .",
    "the considerations outlined in the previous section suggest a simple resolution .",
    "let us define the following diagonal entropy ( or simply d - entropy ) : s_d=-_n _ nn_nn .",
    "[ ent_def ] there is some ambiguity in this definition associated with possible degeneracies in the energy spectrum .",
    "however , these degeneracies are usually either accidental or related to additional symmetries of the system .",
    "generically these generacies are absent and we will assume here that this is indeed the case . if the hamiltonian is time independent then @xmath3 formally corresponds to the usual von neumann entropy defined by the time - averaged density matrix = _ t1/t_0^t ( t)dt ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time , the expression  ( [ ent_def ] ) is defined instantaneously and thus does not require coarse - graining of the density matrix or the assumption that the hamiltonian is stationary .",
    "the definition  ( [ ent_def ] ) suggests a classical generalization where instead of a sum over many - body states one takes the integral over orbits corresponding to different energies of the system . the analogue of @xmath7 would be a probability to find the system in the corresponding orbit : p(e)=d*x*d*p * ( * x*,*p*)(e - e(*x*,*p * ) ) , where @xmath11 span the many - particle phase space and @xmath12 is the probability to occupy a particular phase - space point .",
    "so the classical diagonal entropy can be defined as s_d^cl =- de n(e ) p(e)p(e ) , where n(e)=d*x*d*p * ( e - e(*x*,*p * ) ) is the ( many - particle ) density of states .",
    "let us show that @xmath3 is consistent with the known properties of the thermodynamic entropy . in equilibrium , when the density matrix is stationary ( diagonal ) , clearly @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath3 satisfies such requirements as extensivity , positivity .",
    "it also automatically vanishes in the zero - temperature limit satisfying the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "then we observe that the entropy @xmath3 can change in time .",
    "if the initial state is stationary then for any time - dependent process in a closed hamiltonian system we have @xmath14 .",
    "the proof of this statement can be adopted from ref .",
    "@xcite ( see eqs .  ( 2.4 ) - ( 2.10 ) ) by straightforward generalization to the quantum case where instead of the time averaging we use the microscopic definition of @xmath15 .",
    "first , we identify @xmath16 as a diagonal part of the full time - dependent density matrix @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 . by using the jensen s inequality",
    "we obtain that ( see also eq .  ( 1.40 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ( -+_d_d ) ( -_d)_d=0 hence we find that @xmath20 .",
    "at the same time in closed systems the von neumann entropy is conserved in time , @xmath21 .",
    "noting that @xmath22 , since the initial density matrix is diagonal by the assumption , we prove s_d(t)s_d(0 ) .",
    "[ second_law ] note that eq .",
    "( [ second_law ] ) does not imply that @xmath15 is necessarily a monotonic function of time .",
    "there is a simple physical reason behind the diagonal entropy increase . for unitary evolution",
    "the density matrix at time t is given by ( t)=u^(0 ) u , where @xmath23 is the evolution operator .",
    "if the initial density matrix is stationary ( diagonal ) then it is easy to see that the diagonal elements of the time evolved density matrix are _",
    "nn(t)=_m    @xmath24 have a simple interpretation of transition rates between instantaneous energy levels .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 is doubly stochastic implying that the transition probabilities satisfy the sum rule  @xcite : _",
    "m p_mn=_m p_nm=1 .",
    "this sum rule states that the total rate of leaving a particular level @xmath26 is equal to the sum of rates of coming to this level from all other energy levels .",
    "this sum rule is a direct consequence of the unitarity of the evolution and it is not generally valid in open ( not - hamiltonian ) systems .",
    "it is straightforward to realize that the sum rule above guarantees that any dynamical process leads to a more uniform spread of the probability density among energy levels , i.e. forces system closer to a microcanonical distribution @xmath27 .",
    "since the diagonal entropy is a measure of the spread of @xmath7 it necessarily increases or stays constant .",
    "one of the most important and nontrivial postulates of thermodynamics is that the entropy is a unique function of energy and external parameters : @xmath28 . this assumption allows to relate infinitesimal change of entropy for _ any _ dynamical process to the change of energy and change of external parameters e",
    "= ts-_j e_j|_s_j .",
    "[ fund_rel1 ] the derivatives of energy with respect to the external parameters @xmath29 are called generalized forces .",
    "they are related to adiabatic changes of the spectrum of the system  @xcite .",
    "therefore the first term @xmath30 ( heat ) must be associated with the transitions between microscopic energy levels . the non - triviality of eq .",
    "( [ fund_rel1 ] ) is that it must be valid for any microscopic process as long as changes of energy , entropy , and parameters of the system remain small . in particular",
    ", it implies that for any cyclic process the change of energy is simply proportional to the change of entropy with the proportionality constant ( temperature ) being completely insensitive to how and which external parameters changed in time .",
    "this thermodynamic postulate thus puts very severe constraints on the microscopic definition of the entropy .",
    "von neumann entropy clearly does not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ fund_rel1 ] ) .",
    "for example , if we consider any cyclic process in a closed system then @xmath31 , while @xmath32 is generically nonzero .",
    "let us show that the d - entropy satisfies the fundamental relation ( [ fund_rel1 ] ) .",
    "for now we will do it making an additional assumption that the initial density matrix is thermal , i.e. that it is described the gibbs distribution : ^0=1z(-h^0 ) .",
    "[ gibbs_rho ] in the next section we will lift this assumption and will show that eq .",
    "( [ fund_rel1 ] ) is valid in a more general case .",
    "first we write the change of the energy to the linear order in @xmath33 and @xmath34 : e_n e_n(t ) _ n^0 + _",
    "n e_n(0)_nn(t ) , [ delta_e ] where @xmath35 is a change of the instantaneous energy levels due to time evolution , @xmath36 is the change of the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix , and @xmath37 . in the adiabatic limit @xmath38 and thus the first term in eq .",
    "( [ delta_e ] ) corresponds to the adiabatic change of the energy @xmath39 while the second one corresponds to the heat  @xcite .",
    "next we consider a similar expression for the change of the d - entropy . to the leading order in @xmath40 ( noting that @xmath41 ) we find s_d-_n _ nn(t)_n^0 .",
    "[ delta_s ] using the gibbs distribution  ( [ gibbs_rho ] ) and comparing eqs .",
    "( [ delta_e ] ) and ( [ delta_s ] ) we immediately find ee_ad+ ts_d .",
    "[ delta_e1 ] the first term here @xmath42 is a function of the state , i.e. it depends only on the instantaneous values of the external parameters @xmath29 and the initial probabilities @xmath43 .",
    "thus it can be expressed e_ad=_j ( e/_j)_s_d_j .",
    "we see that eq .",
    "( [ delta_e1 ] ) is indeed equivalent to the relation  ( [ fund_rel1 ] ) .",
    "note that actually the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ delta_e1 ] ) relied neither on the assumption that the off - diagonal elements of the diagonal density matrix are zero nor on the assumption that the system was closed during the dynamical process .",
    "it is well known from standard thermodynamics that in large systems the choice of the statistical ensemble is usually dictated purely by convenience .",
    "the basic laws of thermodynamics , in particular the fundamental relation  ( [ fund_rel1 ] ) , must be valid for any ensemble .",

    "( [ fund_rel1 ] ) from eq .  ( [ delta_e1 ] )",
    "let us perform some simple manipulations with diagonal entropy : [ sd_en ] s_d&=&-_n _ nn(_nn ) + & = & -de n(e ) ^d(e ) + & = & de w(e)s_micro(e)-de w(e).here n(e)=_n ( e - e_n ) is the many - body density of states , ^d(e)=_n _ nn(e - e_n ) , @xmath44 is the distribution function of energy .",
    "it satisfies the normalization condition @xmath45 and defines different moments of energy , e.g. @xmath46 . and finally s_micro(e)=is the microcanonical entropy and @xmath47 is the width of the distribution .",

    "@xmath49 is exponentially large , while @xmath48 is not so the contribution from this factor is negligible  @xcite .",
    "let us now look closely to eq .",
    "( [ sd_en ] ) .",
    "the first term reduces to usual thermodynamic entropy as long as the distribution @xmath50 is sufficiently narrow on the scale of change of the equilibrium entropy , which is typically some extensive scale .",
    "so as long as @xmath50 is sufficiently narrow in energy such that @xmath48 is subextensive the first term in eq .",
    "( [ sd_en ] ) just reproduces the conventional thermodynamic entropy plus non extensive corrections . in non - equilibrium systems",
    "it can be shown that the distribution @xmath50 is indeed narrow under very general conditions such as the locality of the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "thus we see that in order to satisfy the equivalence between a given ensemble defined by the density matrix @xmath9 and equilibrium microcanonical ensemble the first necessary requirement is that energy fluctuations are subextensive .",
    "the second term in eq .  ( [ sd_en ] ) is more subtle .",
    "if we assume that @xmath50 is a smooth function of energy then it is clear that this term is always subextensive .",
    "however , in true non - equilibrium ensembles there can be large state to state fluctuations between occupancies of different microscopic energy levels ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) thus we can write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a smooth part of the distribution @xmath50 and @xmath53 is a stochastic part .",
    "note that low moments of the energy are determined by @xmath52 therefore only @xmath52 is measurable . in noninegrable systems according to the berry s conjecture  @xcite and its generalizations",
    "the many - body eigenstates can be considered as pseudo - random vectors in the hilbert space .",
    "thus one can expect that @xmath53 is a random gaussian function .",
    "this is indeed consistent with recent numerical results  @xcite .",
    "such gaussian noise clearly contributes a subextensive correction to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ sd_en ] ) and can be neglected .",
    "the situation can change in integrable systems , where due to the dynamical constraints only an exponentially small subset of many - body states can be occupied  @xcite .",
    "in other words the density matrix @xmath9 is very ( exponentially ) sparse .",
    "then the contribution from @xmath53 to the diagonal entropy is extensive and the latter is different from the equilibrium temperature .",
    "the sparseness of the distribution is also necessary to see deviations of expectation values of other observables from equilibrium values  @xcite .",
    "therefore in this sense the diagonal entropy is not different from the other observables .    to summarize the discussion above the diagonal entropy in macroscopic systems is equivalent to equilibrium microcanonical entropy up to subextensive corrections if    1 .",
    "the energy distribution @xmath50 is narrow so that @xmath48 is subextensive , 2 .",
    "the energy distribution ( or the diagonal part of the density matrix ) is not very ( exponentially ) sparse so that @xmath54 is subextensive .",
    "both assumptions are expected to be valid in non - integrable systems subject to arbitrary dynamical process .",
    "this was indeed verified in a number of recent studies  @xcite . under the second condition",
    "one can simplify eq .",
    "( [ sd_en ] ) ignoring the stochastic term and substituting @xmath50 by its smooth part @xmath52 so that s_dde w(e)s_micro(e)-de w(e)(w(e)e ) .",
    "[ sd_approx ] this equality also shows that under these assumptions the diagonal entropy is measurable since @xmath52 can be extracted from measuring energy distribution .",
    "note that @xmath55 is defined through the many - body density of states , which does not depend on the dynamical process .",
    "it is easy to see that if the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are satisfied for the initial state then the diagonal entropy still satisfies the fundamental relation  ( [ fund_rel1 ] ) . moreover if these two conditions are satisfied at each moment in time , which should be the case for an arbitrary dynamical process in non - integrable systems , then the eq .",
    "( [ fund_rel1 ] ) is valid at each moment in time and can be integrated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] we will illustrate this numerically using a particular example",
    ".      one of the important properties of the thermodynamic entropy in equilibrium is its additivity . for equilibrium ensembles",
    "the additivity of the statistical entropy follows e.g. from approximate multiplicativity of the number of microstates in two weakly coupled subsystems and the postulate of thermodynamics that all microstates are equally probable  @xcite . indeed according to the standard arguments the number of microstates in the system at a fixed energy @xmath56 is approximately equal to the product of number of microstates in two subsystems comprising the system : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the equilibrium partitioning of the energy between the two subsystems .",
    "the additivity of thermodynamic entropy immediately follows from the definition @xmath59 .",
    "the situation becomes much more subtle away from equilibrium .",
    "some textbooks state that the non - equilibrium entropy is not well defined .",
    "instead one needs to split the system into sufficiently small but yet macroscopic subsystems such that each subsystem is in approximate equilibrium but the subsystems are not in equilibrium with each other ( see e.g. ref .",
    "other textbooks simply avoid discussing this issue . within the first approach the notion of total entropy of the system looses its separate meaning like in equilibrium because it is not defined separately from the sum of the parts . on the contrary",
    "the entropy defined as @xmath59 is clearly not additive away from equilibrium instead it satisfies @xmath60 .",
    "if the system is allowed to equilibrate then according to thermodynamics the sum of the entropies @xmath61 should increase and reach the equilibrium value @xmath62 where the additivity of the entropy is restored .",
    "note that the total entropy of the system @xmath63 can change only if either the total energy of the system or external parameters change in time .",
    "the difference @xmath64 can serve as a measure of `` non - equilibriumness '' of the system .    since thermodynamics gives specific predictions about entropy only in equilibrium ,",
    "its precise definition away from equilibrium , from the point of view of thermodynamics , is not unique .",
    "indeed e.g. the additivity or non - additivity of the entropy can only be established by comparing the total entropy to the sum of the parts . away from equilibrium",
    "only sum of the parts , each in approximate thermodynamic equilibrium , can be measured from e.g. specific heat .",
    "microscopically the situation that one needs to tie the definition of the object ( entropy ) to the particular state of the system is very inconvenient .",
    "it is much easier to keep the definition ( [ ent_def ] ) , which is equivalent to eqs .",
    "( [ sd_en ] ) , ( [ sd_approx ] ) , intact but keep in mind that the additivity of the d - entropy is expected only in equilibrium ( or more accurately in steady ) state .",
    "thus we have to keep in mind the following correspondence s_d & & ( e ) + s_d^(1)+s_d^(2)&&_1(e_1)+_2(e_2 ) , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the diagonal entropies of the two subsystems . in this way",
    "one avoids any ambiguities with the definition of the total entropy .",
    "but one needs to keep in mind that away from equilibrium sum of thermodynamics entropies of subsystems corresponds to the sum of diagonal entropies of these subsystems but not to the total d - entropy .    in thermal equilibrium",
    "the additivity of the d - entropy follows from the additivity of von neuman entropy , which is well established in statistical physics .",
    "if a non - integrable system is driven away from equilibrium and then allowed to equilibrate then the additivity of the d - entropy in the new steady state follows from eq .",
    "( [ sd_approx ] ) under two conditions : ( i ) the equilibrium microcanonical entropy is approximately additive and ( ii ) the distribution of the energy partitioning between the two systems is narrow .",
    "the former property is automatically satisfied in macroscopic systems while the latter is expected from extensivity of the energy . in the next section",
    "we will illustrate how this extensivity approximately works using a numerical example .",
    "note that for von neumann s entropy one does not expect additivity to hold even after the system reaches the steady state .",
    "let us point another property of the sum of diagonal entropies , which is also in line with thermodynamic expectations .",
    "assume that we have two initially uncoupled systems each in a local equilibrium .",
    "then the two systems are allowed to interact . according to the second law of thermodynamics the sum of entropies of the two subsystems",
    "should either increase or stay the same .",
    "the diagonal entropy satisfies the same property  @xcite : s_d^(1)(t)+s_d^(2)(t)s_d^(1)(0)+s_d^(2)(0 ) .",
    "[ second_law_sum ] the proof of this statement is as follows . since the two systems are initially in local equilibrium then @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "because the two systems are initially decoupled the von neumann s entropy is additive @xmath69 .",
    "the von neumann s entropy is conserved in time thus @xmath70 .",
    "next we can use subadditivity of the von neumann s entropy  @xcite : @xmath71 . finally using that @xmath72 ( see sec .  [ sec : second law ] ) we prove eq .",

    "let us start from a very simple but illustrative example highlighting qualitatively behavior of the diagonal entropy . namely we consider a classical noninteracting gas initially confined to the one half of a container separated by a membrane ( see fig .",

    "the membrane is removed and the gas expands to the whole container . from the point of view of classical thermodynamics the entropy of the gas increases by the amount @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the total number of particles .",

    "one can obtain it by explicit calculations re - expanding the initial density matrix in the new basis and computing d - entropy .",

    "the black dashed line describes coarse - grained dynamics where after each quench the density matrix is effectively averaged over time .",
    "this is equivalent of quenching the system each time from the diagonal ensemble obtained from the previous quench .",
    "it is clear from the figure that until cycle # 50 , where a time reversal transformation is introduced , the exact and coarse - grained dynamics give very similar time dependence . in both cases",
    "the d - entropy gradually approaches maximum possible entropy in the system @xmath99 , where @xmath89 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "the situation changes drastically after we introduce the time reversal transformation .",
    "then the exact dynamics results in gradual decrease of the d - entropy as the system is quenched back to the ground state , while in the coarse - grained dynamics is insensitive to the time reversal transformation and the d - entropy continues to increase . to check the sensitivity of the entropy decrease to the accuracy of the time - reversal transformation we also analyzed exact dynamics when we introduced small time - reversal symmetry perturbation",

    "namely after reversing the dynamics after each cycle we introduced a small random uniform energy shift in the system distributed in the interval @xmath100 $ ] . as can be seen from the figure , this",
    "small perturbation results in initial entropy decrease after time reversal , which persists for a few cycles and after that d - entropy starts increasing again .",
    "this is indeed in perfect agreement with our expectations .      finally using the same numerical setup we will check the key property of the entropy - its uniqueness as a function of energy . for this purpose we will consider a non - equilibrium dynamics in the system where , as in the previous example",
    ", the coupling @xmath92 is quenched back and force .",
    "but now we will consider periodic sequence of pulses where the time between consequent quenches is fixed .",
    "this results in a highly non - equilibrium dynamics non monotonic dependence of both entropy and energy on the number of cycles .",
    "this dependence is also very sensitive to the period of the modulation .    .",

    "[ fig : diag_ent_4 ] we plot three different dependence of entropy versus energy for different times between quenches : @xmath102 .",

    "small discrepancies between the curves are expected because of relatively small system size .",

    "one can also consider pulses with different modulation amplitudes .",
    "the resulting curves again show only small deviations from the ones plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag_ent_4 ] .",
    "we showed that the d - entropy @xmath3 , introduced in this work , is consistent with various properties of the thermodynamic entropy . the d - entropy is microscopically defined . for equilibrium ensembles it coincides with the von neumann s entropy .",
    "however , away from equilibrium , it is different .",
    "we showed that the d - entropy satisfies the key properties of the thermodynamic entropy :    * if a closed system is initially prepared in a stationary state then the change of the d - entropy as a result of _ any _ dynamical process is non - negative .",
    "* the d - entropy is automatically conserved for adiabatic processes characterized by vanishing transition probabilities between instantaneous energy eigenstates ( or in macroscopic systems by vanishing phase - space volume available for such transitions ) . * if the two initially stationary subsystems brought to the contact with each other then the sum of d - entropies either increases or stays constant . * if initially the system is prepared in the thermally equilibrium state at temperature @xmath95 then for _ any _ dynamical process for both open and closed systems the d - entropy satisfies the fundamental thermodynamic relation : @xmath103 , where @xmath104 are external parameters describing the system . * the d - entropy is uniquely related to the energy distribution and thus is measurable ( at least in principle ) both in equilibrium and away from it .",
    "moreover as long as the hamiltonian of the system is local and non - integrable , such that the energy fluctuations are subextensive and the support of the density matrix in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian is not exponentially sparse , the d - entropy is a unique function of the energy at any time ( whether the system is in equilibrium or not ) .",
    "this means , in particular , that the fundamental thermodynamic relation is microscopically applicable to any dynamical processes .",
    "if the process is non - stationary then by temperature and generalized forces one needs to understand their equilibrium values .",
    "* the diagonal entropy is non - additive away from equilibrium . in particular , in macroscopic systems the difference between the total d - entropy and the sum of d - entropies of the subsystems can serve as a measure of non - equilibriumness of the system again in agreement with thermodynamics , using a specific example of a non - integrable system we illustrated that after an instantaneous quench the total d - entropy changes instantaneously ( similarly to the total energy ) while the sum of the entropies of the subsystems changes gradually ( again similarly to the sum of energies of the subsystems ) .",
    "let us make a few additional remarks .",
    "first we note that in complex closed systems for quasi - stationary processes the density matrix always remains effectively diagonal in a sense that off - diagonal matrix elements of density matrix having essentially random phases do not affect any local observables  @xcite and the consequent dynamics . in this case as we demonstrated @xmath3 should monotonically increase in time . in such situations",
    "one can effectively erase off - diagonal elements of @xmath9 and assume the density matrix to be always diagonal .",
    "then the diagonal entropy simply coincides with the von neumann entropy .",
    "however , in general this assumption is not satisfied , for example , if the process is not quasi - stationary or if the system has memory effects . then erasing off - diagonal elements of the density matrix",
    "is not permitted .",
    "for example , in simple spin systems one can perform spin - echo type experiments , where after quenching magnetic field and initial dephasing in the system due to some randomness , one can perform a time - reversal transformation so that the spins restore the original coherence . in this case , the d - entropy first increases and then decreases back in time to the original value .",
    "but the situations like this where the entropy can decrease in time are very non - generic because they require ability to perform a time - reversal transformation on the hamiltonian very accurately ( see also discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag_ent_3 ] we illustrate this point with a toy - model system subject to the spin - echo type process .",
    "even a very small perturbation , which breaks time inversion , completely destroys the reversibility and the d - entropy continues to increase in time . from our analysis",
    "it follows that the maximum entropy state corresponding to @xmath7 independent of @xmath105 is a natural attractor of the hamiltonian dynamics . in this respect ,",
    "the second law of thermodynamics naturally follows from the microscopic equations of motion .",
    "there is a more subtle issue of relevance of the d - entropy to information .",
    "if the hamiltonian is constant in time , @xmath3 is only sensitive to the stationary information encoded in time - independent diagonal elements of the density matrix . conversely the von neumann s entropy is sensitive to all information in the system , stationary or not .",
    "this sensitivity results in @xmath2 being time independent for any dynamical processes in a closed system , because time evolution is a unitary transformation , which does not change the total information content .",
