    "since antiquity it has been intuited that the distribution of primes among the natural numbers is in many ways random .",
    "for this reason , functions that reliably generate primes have been revered for their apparent traction on the set of primes .",
    "ribenboim ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page  179 ) provides three classes into which certain prime - generating functions fall :    1 .",
    "@xmath5 is the @xmath6th prime @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath5 is always prime , and @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "3 .   the set of positive values of @xmath10 is equal to the set of prime numbers .",
    "known functions in these classes are generally infeasible to compute in practice .",
    "for example , both gandhi s formula @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 , and willans formula @xmath13 @xcite satisfy condition ( a ) but are essentially versions of the sieve of eratosthenes @xcite .",
    "gandhi s formula depends on properties of the mbius function @xmath14 , while willans formula is built on wilson s theorem .",
    "jones @xcite provided another formula for @xmath7 using wilson s theorem .",
    "functions satisfying ( b ) are interesting from a theoretical point of view , although all known members of this class are not practical generators of primes .",
    "the first example was provided by mills @xcite , who proved the existence of a real number @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is prime for @xmath17 .",
    "the only known way of finding an approximation to a suitable @xmath15 is by working backward from known large primes .",
    "several relatives of mills function can be constructed similarly @xcite .",
    "the peculiar condition ( c ) is tailored to a class of multivariate polynomials constructed by matiyasevich @xcite and jones et al .",
    "@xcite with this property .",
    "these results are implementations of primality tests in the language of polynomials and thus also can not be used to generate primes in practice .",
    "it is evidently quite rare for a prime - generating function to not have been expressly _ engineered _ for this purpose .",
    "one might wonder whether there exists a nontrivial prime - generating function that is `` naturally occurring '' in the sense that it was not constructed to generate primes but simply _ discovered _ to do so .",
    "euler s polynomial @xmath18 of 1772 is presumably an example ; it is prime for @xmath19 .",
    "of course , in general there is no known simple characterization of those @xmath6 for which @xmath18 is prime .",
    "so , let us revise the question : is there a naturally occurring function that always generates primes ?",
    "the subject of this paper is such a function .",
    "it is recursively defined and produces a prime at each step , although the primes are not distinct as required by condition ( b ) .",
    "the recurrence was discovered in 2003 at the nks summer school , at which i was a participant .",
    "primary interest at the summer school is in systems with simple definitions that exhibit complex behavior . in a live computer experiment led by stephen wolfram , we searched for complex behavior in a class of nested recurrence equations . a group led by matt",
    "frank followed up with additional experiments , somewhat simplifying the structure of the equations and introducing different components .",
    "one of the recurrences they considered is @xmath20 they observed that with the initial condition @xmath1 , for example , the sequence of differences @xmath21 ( sequence http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/a132199 [ ] ) appears chaotic @xcite .",

    "it certainly seems to be the case that larger and larger primes appear fairly frequently .",
    "unfortunately , these primes do not come for free : if we compute terms of the sequence without the aforementioned shortcut , then a prime @xmath29 appears only after @xmath30 consecutive @xmath3s , and indeed the primality of @xmath29 is being established essentially by trial division . as we will see , the shortcut is much better , but it requires an external primality test , and in general it requires finding the smallest prime divisor of an integer @xmath31 .",
    "so although it is naturally occurring , the recurrence , like its artificial counterparts , is not a magical generator of large primes .",
    "we mention that benoit cloitre @xcite has considered variants of equation  ( [ rec ] ) and has discovered several interesting results . a striking parallel to the main result of this paper",
    "is that if @xmath32 with @xmath33 , then @xmath34 ( sequence http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/a135506 [ ] ) is either @xmath3 or prime for each @xmath35 .",

    "additional features of table  [ table ] not vital to the main result are discussed in section  [ primes ] .",
    "one observes from the data that @xmath38 contains long runs of consecutive @xmath3s .",
    "on such a run , say if @xmath40 for @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 so the difference @xmath43 is invariant in this range . when the next nontrivial @xmath22 does occur , we see in table  [ table ] that it has some relationship to this difference .",
    "indeed , it appears to divide @xmath44 for example @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc .",
    "this observation is easy to prove and is a first hint of the shortcut mentioned in section  [ introduction ] .",
    "restricting attention to steps where the @xmath22 is nontrivial , one notices that @xmath49 whenever @xmath50 .",
    "this fact is the central ingredient in the proof of the lemma , and it suggests that @xmath4 may be worthy of study . we pursue this in section  [ global ]",
    ".    another important observation can be discovered by plotting the values of @xmath6 for which @xmath50 , as in figure  [ clusters ] .",
    "they occur in clusters , each cluster initiated by a large prime and followed by small primes interspersed with @xmath3s .",
    "the ratio between the index @xmath6 beginning one cluster and the index ending the previous cluster is very nearly @xmath51 , which causes the regular vertical spacing seen when plotted logarithmically . with",
    "further experimentation one discovers the reason for this , namely that when @xmath52 is prime for @xmath50 , such a `` large gap '' between nontrivial @xmath22s occurs ( demarcating two clusters ) and the next nontrivial @xmath22 is @xmath53 .",
    "this suggests looking at the quantity @xmath54 ( which is @xmath55 when @xmath49 ) , and one guesses that in general the next nontrivial @xmath22 is the smallest prime divisor of @xmath56 .    , the @xmath57th value of @xmath6 for which @xmath58 , for the initial condition @xmath1 .",
    "the regularity of the vertical gaps between clusters indicates local structure in the sequence . ]",
    "we now establish the observations of the previous section , treating the recurrence  ( [ rec ] ) as a discrete dynamical system on pairs @xmath59 of integers .",
    "we no longer assume @xmath1 ; a general initial condition for the system specifies integer values for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "accordingly , we may broaden the result : in the previous section we observed that @xmath62 is a significant recurring event ; it turns out that @xmath63 plays the same role for other initial conditions ( for example , @xmath64 ) .",
    "the following lemma explains the relationship between one occurrence of this event and the next , allowing the elimination of the intervening run of @xmath3s .",
    "we need only know the smallest prime divisor of @xmath65 .",

    "brief remarks on the condition @xmath78 are in order .",
    "foremost , this condition guarantees that the prime @xmath29 exists , since @xmath79",
    ". however , we can also interpret it as a restriction on the initial condition .",
    "we stipulate @xmath80 because otherwise @xmath72 does not exist ; note however that among positive integers this excludes only the two initial conditions @xmath81 and @xmath82 . a third initial condition , @xmath83 ,",
    "is eliminated by the inequality ; most of the conclusion holds in this case ( since @xmath84 ) , but because @xmath85 it is not covered by the following proof .",
    "let @xmath86 .",
    "we show that @xmath87 .",
    "clearly @xmath88 is an integer if @xmath89 ; if @xmath90 then @xmath91 is odd , so @xmath88 is again an integer .    by equation  ( [ runofones ] )",
    ", for @xmath92 we have @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 divides both @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so @xmath94 also divides both their difference @xmath97 and the linear combination @xmath98 we use these facts below .",
    "@xmath99 : since @xmath100 divides @xmath101 and by assumption @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 . since @xmath100 also divides @xmath104 , we have @xmath105    @xmath106 : now that @xmath107 for @xmath108 , we show that @xmath109 produces a nontrivial @xmath22 .",
    "we have @xmath110 by the definition of @xmath29 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "thus @xmath29 divides both arguments of the @xmath22 , so @xmath113 .",
    "therefore @xmath87 , and we have shown ( a ) . on the other hand , @xmath114 divides @xmath115 , so in fact @xmath116 , which is ( b ) .",
    "we now have @xmath117 , so to obtain ( c ) we compute @xmath118    we immediately obtain the following result for @xmath1 ; one simply computes @xmath119 , and @xmath120 so the lemma applies inductively thereafter .",
    "let @xmath1 .",
    "for each @xmath35 , @xmath2 is @xmath3 or prime .",
    "similar results can be obtained for many other initial conditions , such as @xmath121 , @xmath23 , etc . indeed",
    ", most small initial conditions quickly produce a state in which the lemma applies .",
    "however , the statement of the theorem is false for general initial conditions . two examples of non - prime @xmath22s are @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath125 . with additional",

    "@xmath215 we have @xmath40 , so @xmath216 and @xmath217 an analogous result holds for @xmath89 and @xmath218 prime : @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "in fact , this analogy suggests a more general similarity between the two cases @xmath89 and @xmath90 : an evolution for @xmath89 can generally be emulated ( and actually computed twice as quickly ) by @xmath222 under the transformation @xmath223 for even @xmath6 ( discarding odd @xmath6 ) .",
    "one verifies that the conditions and conclusions of the lemma are preserved ; in particular @xmath224 for example , the evolution from initial condition @xmath225 is emulated by the evolution from @xmath226 for @xmath227 .",
    "one wonders whether @xmath38 takes on all primes . for @xmath90 ,",
    "clearly the case @xmath228 never occurs since @xmath229 is odd .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath89 , the case @xmath228 can only occur once for a given initial condition : a simple checking of cases shows that @xmath72 is even , so applying the lemma to @xmath72 we find @xmath230 is odd ( at which point the evolution can be emulated by @xmath222 ) .",
    "we conjecture that all other primes occur .",
    "after ten thousand applications of the shortcut starting from the initial condition @xmath1 , the smallest odd prime that has not yet appeared is @xmath231 .    for general initial conditions the results are",
    "similar , and one quickly notices that evolutions from different initial conditions frequently converge to the same evolution after some time , reducing the number that must be considered .",
    "for example , @xmath121 and @xmath1 converge after two steps to @xmath232 .",
    "one can use the shortcut to feasibly track these evolutions for large values of @xmath6 and thereby estimate the density of distinct evolutions . in the range @xmath233",
    "one finds that there are only @xmath234 equivalence classes established below @xmath235 , and no two of these classes converge below @xmath236 .",
    "it therefore appears that disjoint evolutions are quite sparse .",
    "sequence http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/a134162 [ ] is the sequence of minimal initial conditions for these equivalence classes .",
