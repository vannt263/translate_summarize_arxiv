    "averaging over different graphs is basic in numerous applications of the graph theory @xcite . for such tasks , knowledge of",
    "the number of topologically different graphs is of primary importance . having two graphs ,",
    "a typical question is : are they different ? if the graphs are labeled , respective algorithms are of polynomial time . however , for unlabeled graphs the task should be to check all possible labellings , what makes the problem unfeasible @xcite .",
    "an alternative solution is to find a quantity which is different for different graphs , and of the same value if the graphs are topologically equivalent .",
    "the latter means that there is a one - to - one transformation from one graph to another : each pair of nodes linked ( not linked ) in one graph is linked ( not linked ) in another graph .",
    "such a quantity is a topological invariant .",
    "however , actually we can be never sure if the quantity proposed as the invariant has indeed the above discriminating property .",
    "while its different values certainly mean different graph structures , the same value does not allow to claim that the graphs are indeed topologically identical .",
    "in many cases , the proposed quantity appears to be degenerate , i.e. its value is the same for different graphs .",
    "all that remains true for unlabeled trees , which are graphs without cyclic paths and without loops .    in a series of papers , schultz et al . proposed and evaluated some scalar quantities as candidates to be topological invariants for trees @xcite .",
    "this work was motivated by a chemical application of the constructed quantities , which were found to increase monotonically with the melting temperature of alkanes .",
    "however , almost all proposed invariants were found to be degenerate . on the other hand ,",
    "the last proposed invariant is a real number and not integer , and the comparison of its value must rely on the numerical accuracy .",
    "here we propose a new candidate as a topological invariant for unlabeled trees .",
    "unlike the quantities discussed previously , this is a set of matrices and not a single number .",
    "the advantage is that the matrices are ordered in a simple way , and the ordering algorithm works in polynomial time . on the other hand , to state that two trees are topologically identical we compare all the matrix elements .",
    "this modification is expected to enhance the discriminative force of the proposed invariant .",
    "we use the obtained criterion to calculate the number of topologically non - equivalent trees up to @xmath7 nodes .",
    "as stated above , the obtained numbers can be treated only as an evaluation of the true results from below .",
    "then , if one has a better criterion , he should find the greater number of trees for @xmath8 , than our result , given in table 1 .",
    ".[tab ] the number of trees @xmath9 evaluated basing on sorted @xmath10 pairs with @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is given by the otter s formula .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the purpose of introducing mti was to differentiate chemical molecules . when a carbon atom ( with proper number of hydrogen atoms ) is assigned to all nodes of trees shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - missing](c)-(f ) they may represent semi - structural formulas of ( c ) 2,2,4-trimethylpentane , ( d ) 3-ethyl-2-methylpentane , ( e ) 2,2-dimethylhexane and ( f ) 3-ethylhexane @xcite . the mti can not differ between pairs ( c , d ) and ( e , f ) of these forms of @xmath13 .",
    "our results contain not only the number of trees , but the structure of all of them .",
    "binary files with distance matrices and the program for their conversion to input files for pajek @xcite program are available from our web page @xcite .",
    "now we are going to prove that for large @xmath0 , the range of any discriminative topological invariant with integer values should increase exponentially with @xmath0 . to each tree",
    ", a different value of the invariant must be assigned , if the invariant is discriminative",
    ". then we get an exponentially increasing number of different integer values .",
    "the length of a range on an axis , where these values can be placed , must increase also at least exponentially , what finishes the proof .",
    "we note that the matrix character of the invariant does not change this result , as long as the matrix size increases as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a constant . in our case @xmath16 , because the matrix is @xmath1 .",
    "we should add that this ` range criterion ' is crucial in the asymptotic regime of large @xmath0 .",
    "up to now , the computational resources do not allow to penetrate this region .",
    "concluding , we have proposed a new topological invariant to discriminate unlabeled trees .",
    "the matrix character of the invariant allows to believe , that the discriminating power of the invariant is much better , than scalar invariants proposed previously .",
