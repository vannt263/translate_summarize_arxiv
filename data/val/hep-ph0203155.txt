    "the distribution functions derived can be used to calculate other leading twist hard scattering cross sections of polarized nucleons .    during the recent years the remarkable growth of deep inelastic scattering data off polarized targets  [ 413 ] allows to perform a detailed analysis . here",
    "the different systematic effects of the data have to be taken into account .",
    "previous analyzes [ 1416 ]   present parameterizations only for the central values of the parton distributions .",
    "it is , however , desirable to derive at the same time parameterizations of the polarized parton densities and those of their @xmath4 error , taking into account all error correlations being available . with these parameterizations at hand",
    "it becomes possible to give estimates on the uncertainty of the measurement of other hard scattering processes of polarized targets w.r.t .",
