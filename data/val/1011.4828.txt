    "in a pioneering work by friedberg , lee and sirlin in 1976 @xcite , non - topological solitons were introduced in a model with a u(1)-symmetric complex scalar field coupled to a real scalar field .",
    "in contrast with topological defects , they are stabilized by a global u(1 ) charge , and their energy density is localized in a finite space region without gauge fields . in 1985 coleman showed such solitons exist in a simpler model with an so(2 ) ( viz .",
    "u(1 ) ) symmetric scalar field only , and called them q - balls @xcite .",
    "q - balls have attracted much attention in particle cosmology since kusenko pointed out that they can exist in all supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "specifically , q - balls can be produced efficiently in the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite and could be responsible for baryon asymmetry @xcite and dark matter @xcite .",
    "q - balls can also influence the fate of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "based on these motivations , stability of q - balls has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "observational signatures of susy q - balls has been studied @xcite , and their mass and flux were constrained by experimental data of the searches for magnetic monopoles and heavy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "currently direct searches for neutral q - balls and for electrically charged q - balls are in progress in super - kamiokande ii @xcite and in the slim experiment @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that gravitational waves are emitted during q - ball formation and could be detected by next - generation gravitational detectors @xcite ,    in spite of increasing concern about non - topological solitons in susy , other equilibrium solutions has not been studied so much , while topological defects have several types according to the symmetry . in this paper",
    "we address a fundamental question : are their any other non - topological solitons in different forms ? if new solitons exist in the theories which allow for q - balls , their observational signals would give us new informations on susy q - ball models .",
    "here we re - analyze scalar field theories which include global u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "we begin with a review of q - ball solutions .",
    "consider an so(2)-symmetric scalar field @xmath0 , whose action is given by [ s ] s = d^4x ,  .",
    "due to the symmetry there is a conserved charge , qd^3x(_1_2t-_2_1 t ) . assuming spherical symmetry and homogeneous phase rotation , [ qball - phase ] = ( r)(t , t ) , one has a field equation , [ feqball ] d^2dr^2 + 2rddr+^2=dvd .",
    "this is equivalent to the field equation for a single static scalar field with a potential @xmath1 .",
    "equilibrium solutions @xmath2 with a boundary condition [ bcqball ] ddr(r=0)=0 ,  ( r)=0 , exist if min@xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this condition is rewritten as [ qexist ] min<^2<m^2(0 ) .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    if one regards the radius @xmath5 as time  and the scalar amplitude @xmath2 as the position of a particle , one can understand q - ball solutions in words of newtonian mechanics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ newton](a ) . equation ( [ feqball ] ) describes a one - dimensional motion of a particle under the conserved force due to the potential @xmath6 and the time - dependent friction @xmath7 .",
    "if one chooses the initial position  @xmath8 appropriately , the static particle begins to roll down the potential slope , climbs up and approaches the origin over infinite time .    to demonstrate numerical solutions later",
    ", we adopt a simple model , [ v3 ] v=12m^2 ^ 2-^3+^4 ,  with   m^2 ,  ,  > 0 . and rescale the quantities as [ rescale ] x^ ,   ,   m ,   . then , the existing condition ( [ qexist ] ) becomes [ qexistv3 ] 0<^2<12 ,   ^2 ^ 2-^2 .    for the same so(2 ) model ,",
    "we suppose a string - like configuration , [ qtube - phase ] = ( r)((n+t),(n+t ) ) , where @xmath9 is nonnegative integer and @xmath10 is the cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "the field equation becomes [ fetube ] d^2dr^2 + 1rddr - n^2r^2+^2=dvd .",
    "if @xmath11 , the field equation is the same as ( [ feqball ] ) except for a numerical coefficient .",
    "therefore , q - ball like solutions of @xmath12 exist .",
    "if @xmath13 , there is no regular solution which satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "however , if we adopt a different boundary condition , ( r=0)=(r)=0 , there is a new type of regular solutions .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath15 which is defined by @xmath16 , then , eq.([fetube ] ) becomes + 2n+1rddr+^2=r^-ndvd|_=r^n if we choose @xmath17 appropriately , we obtain a solution @xmath18 which is expressed in the maclaurin series without odd powers in the neighborhood of @xmath19 . in terms of the original variable @xmath12 , the @xmath9th differential coefficient @xmath20 should be determined by the shooting method , while any lower derivative vanishes at @xmath19 .",
    "we plot some solutions in fig .",
    "[ qtube](a ) .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    we can illustrate existence of the new solutions with @xmath13 by analogy with a particle motion in newtonian mechanics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ newton](b ) . equation ( [ fetube ] ) describes a one - dimensional motion of the particle under the conserved force due to the potential @xmath6 and two non - conserved forces , the friction @xmath21 and the repulsive force @xmath22 . if @xmath23 , by choosing the initial velocity  @xmath24 appropriately , the particle goes down and up the slope , and at some point @xmath25 it turns back and approaches the origin over infinite time . if @xmath26 , @xmath24 vanishes ;",
    "instead , the @xmath9th derivative @xmath27 gently pushes the particle at @xmath28 . therefore , with the appropriate choice of @xmath27 , the particle moves along a similar trajectory to that of @xmath23 .",
    "this argument also indicates that the existence condition of the new soliton solutions are the same as that of q - balls , ( [ qexist ] ) or ( [ qexistv3 ] ) . solutions with the same behavior as the @xmath23 solutions were obtained by kim _",
    "et al_.@xcite , who studied the so(3)-symmetric scalar field without q - charge .",
    "nonzero components of the energy - momentum tensor are given by -t^t_t&=&12(ddr)^2++^22 ^ 2+v , t^r_r&=&12(ddr)^2-+^22 ^ 2-v , t^_&=&-12(ddr)^2++^22 ^ 2-v , t^z_z&=&-12(ddr)^2-+^22 ^ 2-v , t^t_&=&-n^2 the nonzero component @xmath29 indicates that the solutions possess angular - momentum .",
    "each term of the energy - momentum tensor is presented in fig .",
    "[ qtube](b)(c ) .",
    "although the present analysis does not include gravity , we can estimate gravitational effects in the weak field approximation as follows .",
    "if we define the gravitational potential @xmath30 as @xmath31 , and take it into account up to its first order , the einstein equations yeild the extended poisson equation , [ poisson ] ^_=4g(-t^t_t+t^i_i)=8g(^2 ^ 2-v ) , where @xmath32 is the trace of the spatial components . except for @xmath11 cases , the gravitational source in ( [ poisson ] )",
    "vanishes in the center in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane .",
    "furthermore , this field configuration has planar symmetry in the @xmath35 direction .",
    "therefore , we collectively call the new solitons q - tubes .",
    "because so(2 ) is a subgroup of so(@xmath36 ) or su(@xmath37 ) , q - tubes with @xmath11 as well as q - balls can appear in any so(@xmath38 ) or su(@xmath38 ) theory .",
    "by contrast , we suspect that q - tubes with @xmath13 can appear only in u(1 ) theory , since their string - like configuration is topologically unstable in theories with @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    next , we consider an so(3)@xmath41u(1)-symmetric scalar field @xmath42 , whose action is given by = d^4x ,   assuming [ qcrust - phase ] = e^it(r ) ( , , ) , we obtain the field equation , [ fecrust ] d^2dr^2 + 2rddr-2r^2+^2=dvd . if we adopt a boundary condition , [ bccrust ] ( r=0)=(r)=0 , we find a regular solution @xmath2 , like a q - tube solution with @xmath23 .",
    "we plot some solutions in fig .",
    "[ qcrust](a ) .",
    "nonzero components of the energy - momentum tensor are given by -t^t_t&=&12(ddr)^2++^22 ^ 2+v , t^r_r&=&12(ddr)^2-+^22 ^ 2-v , t^_=t^_&=&-12(ddr)^2+^22 ^ 2-v .",
    "in this case @xmath29 vanishes , which means that the solutions possess no angular - momentum .",
    "each term of the energy - momentum tensor is also shown by fig .",
    "[ qcrust](b ) .",
    "the extended poisson equation is given by ^_=4g(-t^t_t+t^i_i)=8g(^2 ^ 2-v ) .",
    "we find that the kinetic term @xmath43 , which is responsible for q - charge , is dominant but vanishes in the center .",
    "therefore , we call the solutions q - crusts .",
    "stability of q - balls has been discussed essentially by energetics .",
    "the total energy of the system is defined by [ e ] e = d^3x\\{12 ^ 2 ^ 2 + 12(_i)^2+v } , where @xmath44 denotes a spatial derivative . for a fixed model @xmath45 and the phase assumption ( [ qball - phase ] ) , there remains a free parameter , @xmath46 or @xmath47 ; accordingly , there is a family of equilibrium solutions .",
    "for such a family , if @xmath48 increases as a function of @xmath47 but @xmath49 decreases , energetics prohibits one q - ball splitting into two under fixed @xmath47 . in this case",
    "we can understand that q - balls are stable under the assumption ( [ qball - phase ] ) . in connection with this argument ,",
    "paccetti correia and schmidt showdeed a useful theorem that stability is determined by the sign of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "sakai and sasaki @xcite proposed a simple method of analyzing stability using catastrophe theory @xcite as follows .",
    "catastrophe theory reveals stability of a mechanical system completely once _",
    "behavior variable(s ) _ , _ control parameter(s ) _ and a _ potential _ are given .",
    "therefore , an essential point is to choose those variables in the q - ball system appropriately . for a given potential",
    "@xmath45 and charge @xmath47 , we consider virtual displacement @xmath51 near the equilibrium solution @xmath2 .",
    "if we redefine @xmath46 by [ omega ] q/_^2(x)d^3x , the domain of definition of @xmath46 is extended to off - equilibrium configurations . using this @xmath46",
    ", we can represent a continuous deformation by a one - parameter family of displacement functions , @xmath52 .",
    "then the energy ( [ e ] ) is regarded as a function of @xmath46 : @xmath53 $ ] . because @xmath54 when @xmath55 is an equilibrium solution , @xmath46 may be regarded as a _ behavior variable _ and @xmath48 as the _",
    "potential_. the charge @xmath47 is given by hand , or physically , it is determined by initial conditions ; therefore , it should be regarded as a _",
    "control parameter_. catastrophe theory tells us that stability changes at @xmath56 or @xmath57 , which are consistent with the above arguments .",
    "properties of q - balls in the model ( [ v3 ] ) were elucidated as follows @xcite .",
    "* @xmath58 : @xmath59 is the absolute minimum . there is no bounds on @xmath47 , and all equilibrium solutions are stable . *",
    "@xmath60 : @xmath59 is a local minimum but the absolute minimum is located at @xmath61 . for each @xmath62",
    ", there is a maximum charge , @xmath63 , above which equilibrium solutions do not exist . for @xmath64 , stable and unstable solutions coexists",
    "it turns out that properties of q - tubes and q - crusts also depend on whether @xmath58 or @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , in the following , we show numerical results for @xmath65 and @xmath66 as typical examples .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    in this case , @xmath48 and @xmath47 diverge because they are infinitely long .",
    "therefore , we define the energy and charge per unit length , respectively , as & = & 2_0^dr \\{12 ^ 2phi^2 + 12(ddr)^2++v},&=&2_0^^2dr .",
    "in accordance with the normalization ( [ rescale ] ) , we rescale the energy / charge variables as ,   q ,   e ,   q.    we show the @xmath67-@xmath68 relations for @xmath65 and for @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ qeqtube ] . from a viewpoint of these relations ,",
    "basic properties for q - tubes are the same as those for q - balls as described above .",
    "they are summarized as follows .",
    "* @xmath58 : there is no bounds on @xmath69 , and all equilibrium solutions are stable . for fixed @xmath69 ,",

    "[ qeqcrust ] . for reference",
    ", we show the results for q - balls , too .",
    "( note that q - balls can appear not only in u(1 ) theories but also in a wide class of theories which include global u(1 ) symmetry . )",
    "what we find for q - crusts is summarized as follows .",
    "* @xmath58 : there is no bounds on @xmath47 , and all equilibrium solutions are stable . for fixed @xmath47 ,",
    "q - balls are energetically more stable than q - crusts , as expected . *",
    "@xmath60 : for each @xmath62 , there is a maximum charge , @xmath63 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "stable and unstable solutions coexists .",
    "interestingly , q - crusts can have larger @xmath47 than q - balls",
    ".    we should note that the above results are based on the phase assumption ( [ qtube - phase ] ) or ( [ qcrust - phase ] ) .",
    "stability against perturbations on the phase configuration ( [ qtube - phase ] ) or ( [ qcrust - phase ] ) can not be revealed by the present energetic analysis and should be studied by dynamical analysis .",
    "we explore equilibrium solutions of non - topological solitons in a general class of scalar field theories which include global u(1 ) symmetry , and then we find new types of solitons : q - tubes in u(1 ) theories and q - crusts in so(3)@xmath41u(1 ) theories . because only @xmath11 q - tubes have homogeneous phase like q - balls , they can appear in a wide class of theories which include u ( 1 ) symmetry . except for @xmath11 q - tubes ,",
    "there is a dip in kinetic energy in the center .",
    "in contrast with cosmic global strings or global monopoles , their gravitational mass can be finite without gauge fields .",
    "we also investigate stability of equilibrium solutions for the model ( [ v3 ] ) under the phase assumption ( [ qtube - phase ] ) or ( [ qcrust - phase ] ) by calculating their charge and energy ( or those per unit length ) .",
    "the charge - energy relations indicate that , if @xmath59 is the absolute minimum , there is no bound on charge , and all solutions are stable . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath59 is a local minimum but the absolute minimum is located at @xmath61 , there is a maximum charge , above which equilibrium solutions do not exist . for fixed charge below the maximum , stable and unstable solutions coexists .",
    "it is interesting that q - tubes with higher winding number can have larger charge density and that q - crusts can have larger charger charge than q - balls .",
    "stability against these phase configurations is beyond the present energetic analysis and should be studied by dynamical analysis , which is our next subject .    unlike q - crusts ,",
    "our q - tubes solutions are infinitely - long and unrealistic in themselves .",
    "nevertheless , q - tubes are the more interesting because they can appear in the minimal ( i.e. , u(1 ) ) models and several researchers have already performed numerical simulations in those models @xcite .",
    "those simulations showed that filament structure appears just before q - ball formation and maintain its shape for a certain time .",
    "we conjecture that such a filament structure is semi q - tubes .",
    "furthermore , according to recent simulations of the collision of two q - balls @xcite , apparent two rings are formed .",
    "we suspect that they are loop q - tubes .",
    "further fundamental investigations of q - tubes and the other solitons together with advanced simulations of q - ball formation may confirm the above conjectures and elucidate observational consequences of q - ball formation in susy .",
