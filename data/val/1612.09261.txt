    "the use of polarization encoded qubits has become ubiquitous in quantum communication protocols with single photons @xcite .",

    "faster and efficient key generation together with robustness to third party attacks have become paramount issues to address .",
    "a topical approach to overcome these hurdles is through higher - dimensional qkd : increasing the dimensionality , @xmath0 , of a qkd protocol leads to better security and higher secure key rates , with each photon carrying up to @xmath1 bits of information @xcite .",
    "employing spatial modes of light , particularly those carrying orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , has shown considerable improvements in data transfer of classical communication systems @xcite . however , realizing high - dimensional quantum communication remains challenging . to date",
    ", the list of reports on high dimensional qkd with spatial modes is not exhaustive , and include protocols in up to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that due to experimental limitations , the secret key rate of a given qkd protocol does not scale with the dimension , i.e. , given a certain set of experimental parameters there exist an optimum number of dimension that maximizes the secret key rate @xcite .",
    "photons with complex spatial and polarization structure , commonly known as vector modes , have been used as information carriers for polarisation encoded qubits in alignment - free qkd @xcite , exploiting the fact that vector modes that carry oam exhibit rotational symmetry , removing the need to align the detectors in order to reconcile the encoding and decoding bases , as would be the case in qkd with only polarization . in these vector modes ,",
    "the spatial and polarization degrees of freedom ( dofs ) are coupled in a non - separable manner , reminiscent of entanglement in quantum mechanics .",
    "this non - separability can be used to encode information and has been done so with classical light @xcite , for example , in mode division multiplexing @xcite .",
    "here we use the non - separability of vector oam modes ( vector vortex modes ) to realize four - dimensional qkd based on the `` bb84 '' protocol @xcite . rather than carrying information encoded in one dof",
    ", the non - separable state can itself constitute a basis for a higher dimensional space that combines two dofs , namely the spatial and polarisation dofs . to fully benefit from the increased state space ,",
    "we introduce a new detection scheme that , deterministically and without dimension dependent sifting loss , can detect all basis elements in our high - dimensional space .",
    "this differs from previous schemes that have used mode filters as detectors , sifting through the space one mode at a time , thus removing all benefit of the dimensionality of the space ( see for example ref .",
    "our approach combines manipulations of the dynamic and panchanratnam - berry phase with static optical elements and , in principle , allows detection of the basis elements with unit probability .",
    "we demonstrate high - dimensional encoding / decoding in our entangled space , obtaining a detection fidelity as high as @xmath3 , with a secret key rate of @xmath4 bits per photon and quantum error rate of @xmath5 . as a means of comparison to other protocols , we calculated the capacity - to - dimension ratio and show that our scheme is more efficient than any other reported to date .",

    "the first qkd demonstrations were performed using the polarisation dof , namely , states in the space spanned by left- circular @xmath8 and right - circular polarization @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 , and later using the spatial mode of light as a dof , e.g. , space spanned by the oam modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 . using entangled states in both dofs allows one to access an even larger state space , i.e. , @xmath14 , described by the higher - order poincar sphere @xcite .",
    "when many @xmath15 subspaces are combined , the dimension @xmath0 of the final space incorporating @xmath16 oam values ( @xmath17 ) is given by @xmath18 .",
    "this opens the way to infinite dimensional encoding using such hyper - entangled states .",

    "note that the polarisation of the two paths is automatically reconciled in each of the output ports of the beam splitter due to the difference of parity in the number of reflections for each input arm .",
