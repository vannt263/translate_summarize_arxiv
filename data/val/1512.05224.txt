    "two dimensional electron systems in a periodic potential in the presence of a magnetic field are characterized by two length scales , the periodicity of the potential and the magnetic length .",
    "the regime where these two length scales are comparable exhibits very interesting phenomena like the hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "recently this regime has been accessed experimentally with observations of a stable hofstadter spectrum in graphene superlattices @xcite and realization of the hofstadter hamiltonian in cold atoms systems @xcite .",
    "this has motivated us to investigate the effects of repulsive interactions in this regime .",
    "the interactions are expected to induce charge ordering in the ground state which may spontaneously break the translational symmetry of the system .",
    "consequently , one of the length scales , namely the periodicity , can change .",
    "this could change the fractal structure .",
    "therefore , we investigate translational symmetry breaking in this system .",
    "interaction induced translational symmetry breaking phases have been studied in the honeycomb lattice in the absence of magnetic field @xcite .",
    "effects of interactions on the hofstadter butterfly have been discussed previously @xcite ; these works do not consider translational symmetry breaking .",
    "we study a system of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice in the hofstadter regime with nearest neighbor repulsive interactions using mean field theory .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the cases when the fermi level lies in a gap and thus expect the mean field approximation to be good .",
    "the ground state of the non - interacting system has all the symmetries of the hamiltonian and non - zero hall conductivity .",
    "our studies reveal various interesting phases as the strength of the interaction is increased .",
    "we get a first order landau transition to a phase with broken translational and rotational symmetries .",
    "this phase is an incompressible nematic phase characterized by an electric quadrupole moment of the ground state charge distribution .",
    "the transition is accompanied by a change in the hall conductivity . in some cases ,",
    "on further increasing the interaction , there is another first order landau transition to an incompressible ferri - electric phase where the inversion symmetry is also broken and the system develops an electric dipole moment .",
    "nematic phases in homogeneous quantum hall systems have previously been theoretically studied @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite in fractional quantum hall systems .",
    "our results show that they occur in the hofstadter regime also .",
    "the nematic order parameter has been related to the quantum metric @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the structure of the anisotropic phases by studying pair correlations from the point of view of the quantum geometric approach to insulating states @xcite .",
    "we find that the shape and the extent of the pair correlations can be exactly related to the quantum metric in the momentum space @xcite , averaged over the brillouin zone ( bz ) @xcite .",
