    "power generation and energy storage technology that utilize electrochemical devices , such as the lithium - ion battery and the fuel cells , have been studied extensively , and their performance has continued to improve regularly . at the core of these electrochemical devices ,",
    "one generally finds systems consisting of complex electrolyte solutions and of charged solids , e.g. , the porous electrode layer in the lithium - ion battery  @xcite and the electrolyte membrane in the fuel cell .  @xcite the transport of the ions and the solvent through the charged solid structure affects the total performance of the devices significantly , and thus the control and optimization of the transport phenomena are central areas of research in the development of innovative electrochemical devices .",
    "@xcite    transport phenomena are observed as flows of the ions and solvent in response to external driving forces .",
    "the driving forces important in electrochemical systems are those induced by the electric field and/or the pressure gradient .",
    "@xcite if the system is close to the thermal equilibrium state so that the system responds linearly to the external fields , the electric current @xmath5 and mass flow @xmath6 induced by the electric field and the pressure gradient are written in the following form :  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electric field and @xmath9 is the mass acceleration representing the pressure gradient .",
    "matrix is a possible extension of this work . ]",
    "the coefficient @xmath10 corresponds to the effective electric conductivity , and @xmath11 is directly related to the permeability of the porous media .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the transport coefficients for the streaming current and the electro - osmotic flow .",
    "reciprocal relation states that the values of these coefficients are identical , i.e. , @xmath14 ( see e.g. , refs  ) .",
    "the values of the transport coefficients are dependent on complex , multi - physics phenomena , namely the internal and external electric field , the solvent flow , and the diffusion and migration of ions .",
    "furthermore , commonly used electrochemical systems exhibit a broad hierarchy of scales : whereas the atomic scale is important at the interface between the solid and the electrolyte solution , the thickness of the electrical double layer formed near the interface can extend to a few tens of nanometers , and the characteristic size in the porous media or membranes through which the electrolyte solution flows ranges from a few nanometers to tens of micrometers .",
    "it is therefore very difficult to evaluate the values of the transport coefficients using a precise model that describes all of the physics included in the system .",
    "one strategy to overcome this difficulty is to incorporate the effect of the interface as boundary conditions for the macroscopic description with coarse - graining the events near the interface , and to evaluate the transport coefficients using equations based on the continuum theory .",
    "@xcite obviously , however , the macroscopic description is not always valid .",
    "when the relevant length scales decrease , the relative effect in the atomic scale becomes significant , and the theoretical predictions fail to reproduce the experimental observation .",
    "@xcite in this case , since the characteristic scale approaches the atomic scale and the scale gap is less important , the molecular dynamics ( md ) method , which deals explicitly with atoms , becomes accurate and efficient .",
    "@xcite applying realistic interaction forces between particles constituting ions , solvent molecules , and charged solids allows one to evaluate the transport coefficients by capturing accurately the phenomena taking place at interfaces .",
    "two methods are available to obtain the responses ( current @xmath5 and the mass flow @xmath6 ) to external fields using md simulations .",
    "one is to assume linear response , and to apply the green  kubo formulas .",
    "@xcite the four transport coefficients are then obtained simultaneously using the results of md simulations performed at thermal equilibrium , without any external force . although the green  kubo formulas are only valid within the limit of the linear response regime , the real systems under usual conditions are most often operating within this limit , in view of the fact that the current and mass flow observed experimentally respond linearly to the external fields ( e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "( for systems in which a non - linear response is important , the transient time correlation function formalism is a possible alternative to the green  kubo approach .",
    "@xcite ) the other method is to directly observe the current and mass flow , after applying an explicit external field in the md simulation .",
    "@xcite this method is referred to as the direct method in the present paper .",
    "since the direct method does not assume the system to be close to thermal equilibrium , the charge and mass flow can be obtained in response to external fields of arbitrary strength .",
    "further , since the actual flows are induced in the simulations , detailed discussion on the profiles of flows is possible .",
    "however , the field strength attainable in laboratories is too small to distinguish the induced flows from the thermal fluctuation , and extremely strong external fields are necessary . therefore , comparison with the results based on the linear response theory is inevitable , before extrapolating the results of the direct method to real systems .    in the present study",
    ", we apply the two methods to specific systems with realistic ions and solvent .",
    "more precisely , the behavior of an aqueous nacl solution in a channel between two charged walls is investigated using md simulations .",
    "the material of the wall is not specified , and simply corresponds to a generic hydrophilic material .",
    "although the results of each method for similar systems have been reported ,  @xcite a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained using the green  kubo formulas with the results of the direct method is , to our knowledge , new . here",
    ", we establish the protocol to evaluate the transport coefficients using the data from md simulations , and we compare systematically the current and mass flow obtained through  eq .",
    "using the transport coefficients with those obtained by using the direct method .",
    "in addition , the influence of the surface , which is important for the flow at a small scale , is investigated .",
    "special attention is devoted to the effect of the surface charge density , because the counter - ion condensation at the charged surface must have important effects on the response .",
    "@xcite the dependence of the effective electrical conductivity and of the flow rate in a poiseuille geometry is examined , and the inversion of the streaming current and the electro - osmotic flow  @xcite is discussed .",
    "we consider an aqueous nacl solution between two charged walls , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "each wall consists of two - dimensional equilateral triangular lattice of a model atom , say atom a , with shortest distance between two atoms being @xmath15 . in the present study , @xmath15 is fixed at @xmath16 . among the wall atoms ,",
    "every @xmath17 atoms in the direction of the shortest distance are negatively charged with one elementary charge ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the absolute value of the surface charge density is then expressed as @xmath19 . since in the present study the walls",
    "are always negatively charged , the surface charge density given in the following refers to its absolute magnitude .",
    "the electrolyte solution contains @xmath20 cl@xmath21 ions and @xmath22 na@xmath23 ions .",

    "the extended simple point charge ( spc / e ) model  @xcite is employed to describe the interactions between water molecules .",
    "the interactions between ions are described simply by a sum of electrostatic and lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials , with parameters taken from ref .  .",
    "the lj parameters for water - ion and na - cl pairs are determined by the lorentz  berthelot mixing rule .",
    "@xcite for the interaction between a wall atom a and a water molecule , we employ the following potential @xmath27 :  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the distance between atoms , and @xmath30 is the distance at which @xmath31 takes the minimum value @xmath32 ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are integers .",

    "note that in real systems the hydrophilic sites are distributed more heterogeneously .",

    "we conclude with a brief discussion on the concentration of the solution in the charged nanochannel . in the simulations for the systems listed in table  [ table03 ] , the counter - ions ( na@xmath23 ions )",
    "were added to compensate the increasing surface charge density .",
    "we here explore the other possibility of compensating the increasing negative charge on the surface , namely , decreasing the concentration of the co - ions ( cl@xmath21 ions ) while maintaining the concentration of the counter - ions ( na@xmath23 ions ) at constant .",
    "table  [ table04 ] lists the simulation parameters used here .",
    "the configurations of the wall atoms in systems @xmath37 are exactly the same as those of systems @xmath38 in table  [ table03 ] , respectively .",
    "the number of na@xmath23 ions is chosen such that the concentration falls within @xmath39 m , and then the number of cl@xmath21 is determined from the charge neutrality .",
    "the transport coefficients of systems @xmath37 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . one obvious qualitative difference from fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] is the significant decrease of the conductivity at @xmath40c / m@xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) .",
    "this decrease is caused by the fact that most of the counter - ions are condensed at the interface in the case of the high surface charge density , and the number of the mobile ions are greatly reduced .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath42 , which represents the concentration in the mobile region , of system  @xmath43 is very small compared with that of system  @xmath44 .",
    "another important difference is that the reversal of the streaming current and the electro - osmotic flow does not occur at @xmath45c / m@xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) ) , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not change their sign , although the values are slightly smaller than those for @xmath46c / m@xmath41 .",
    "this is because the number of co - ions is not sufficient to form the negatively charged region observed in fig .",
    "[ fig07](a ) .",
    "if an experiment corresponding to the systems considered in the present study is performed for a setup with two reservoirs of constant concentration @xmath47 connected by a nanochannel , @xmath42 will be comparable to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the systems listed in table  [ table03 ] are relevant because the value of @xmath42 is controlled such that it ranges within @xmath48 m , whereas the value of @xmath42 varies significantly in table  [ table04 ] .",
    "it is then important to notice that the value of @xmath42 that is common to na@xmath23 and cl@xmath21 is defined only if the thickness of the electrical double layer is sufficiently short compared with the channel width , as in the systems considered in the present paper ; otherwise the concentration of na@xmath23 differs from that of cl@xmath21 over the channel . in the latter case",
    "the donnan effect manifests itself  ; in our case this length is indeed comparable to the width for the highest charge densities , which highlights the importance of considering the possibility of a reduction in free salt concentration . ] and the concentration of cl@xmath21 should decrease upon increasing the surface charge density ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "therefore care must be taken in setting the value of concentration for systems with different surface charge densities , depending on the circumstances , because the manner of changing the concentration has significant influence on the qualitative behavior of the electrolyte solution , as demonstrated by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig05 ] and [ fig11 ] .",
    "in the present paper , we have studied the currents and mass flows of an aqueous nacl solution in nanochannels of the gap  @xmath49 induced by an electric field and a mass acceleration corresponding to a pressure gradient . in order to accurately calculate the four transport coefficients through the green  kubo formulas , ten md simulation runs with different initial configurations for each system",
    "are carried out to obtain smooth time - correlation functions .",
    "comparison of the current and mass flow predicted by eq .   with those obtained by the direct method revealed that , although extremely strong external fields led to large discrepancies , the two results converged within a range of external field strengths for which the flows were still distinguishable from the thermal fluctuation . in the present study , we considered the time - independent external fields .",
    "however , the responses to the time - dependent fields , such as oscillatory fields , can be also examined by means of both the green - kubo formulas and the direct method , the results of which should coincide in the linear response regime .",
    "@xcite    one of the advantages of the direct method using nonequilibrium simulation is that the flow induced in the channel is obtained with better statistics than those in the simulation at thermal equilibrium , because of significant perturbation due to the external fields .",
    "therefore , generally the computational cost required to obtain the flow at a specified field strength is much less than that required to perform the time - integration in the green  kubo formulas , as discussed in section  [ sec_first ] .",
    "however , extrapolating only a few results of the direct method can mislead us , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] .",
    "a careful examination is inevitable to ascertain if the field strength is in the linear or non - linear regime , the cost of which can comparable with that for the green  kubo approach . therefore , in studies on responses to external fields , it is preferable to first investigate the system properties through the green  kubo approach , followed by the additional computations to observe the flow directly , as has been done in fig .  [ fig08 ] , or to investigate the non - linear regime as necessary .",
    "a relevant discussion is found in a recent note on the computation of the bulk viscosity in ref .  .",
    "the influence of the surface charge density of the channel walls was also examined , with maintaining the channel width and the concentration of cl@xmath21 at constant . as a result ,",
    "the effective electric conductivity and the rate of the poiseuille - type flow were found to be reduced by the large surface charge density , because the excess na@xmath23 ions strongly bound near the interface interfered with the charge and mass flows .",
    "the reversal of the streaming current and the electro - osmotic flow was observed both in the transport coefficients obtained with the green  kubo formulas and in the results of the direct method , which is consistent with the finding reported in ref .  .",
    "as an extension of the present study , it would be interesting to investigate the influence of the variety of the surfaces , for example , hydrophobic surfaces and more complicated chemically modified surfaces .",
    "another direction of future studies could be to replace the solute and solvent by the more complex ones used in lithium ion batteries and fuel cells for understanding the nano - scale transport properties important in the state - of - the - art electrochemical devices .",
    "our study shows that , apart from the computational cost in dealing with more complex systems ( for which nonlinear effects may be even more important than shown here ) and the difficulty in identifying the appropriate force fields , there is no principle difficulty in obtaining accurate values of the electro - osmotic coefficients at this scale using molecular dynamics .",
