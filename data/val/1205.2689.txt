    "though there are various fermions observed in nature , we do not yet have a satisfactory explanation for the variety .",
    "evidently , the variety of fermions relates to the variety of forces .",
    "however , any grand unified theory has not yet succeeded in clarifying enough the underlying structure generating the variety and complexity seen in the standard model .",
    "we here propose a view that spontaneous violation of lorentz symmetry may be the direct origin of the variety and complexity of fermions and forces .",
    "the view is based on the investigation of spontaneous lorentz violation ( slv ) in a model , the structure of which is very similar to the standard electro - weak theory . according to this model ,",
    "fermion masses are generated by the breakdown of lorentz symmetry . in this sense ,",
    "the magnitude of lorentz violation is of the order of fermion masses .",
    "customarily , such a  large \" violation of lorentz invariance is considered irrelevant for a description of standard elementary particle physics due to the severe constraints on lorentz violation by experimental observations . for this reason , lorentz violation",
    "is usually discussed in conjunction with planck - scale physics in order to suppress such disastrous effects by the inverse powers of the planck mass @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a grand unified model associated with a large lorentz violation would be received with suspicion , since such a model would significantly break every fundamental law of physics .",
    "however , we show here that this could be simply an erroneous impression .",
    "the unified picture of fermions presented here is based on a model showing a particular type of spontaneous lorentz violation in which an appropriate local phase transformation can eliminate the resultant lorentz breaking term in the effective field theory .",
    "this implies that the lorentz violation at the lagrangian level should be distinguished from that at the observation level , and that the magnitude of observational lorentz violation is not necessarily of the same order as that of lorentz - violating terms in the lagrangian .",
    "actually , we can see that even a simple redefinition of field in a lorentz - invariant theory can mimic lorentz violation . in this case",
    "the magnitude of the lorentz - violating parameter becomes almost indifferent to the observational magnitude of lorentz violation .    on the other hand , since the field redefinition modifies the particle picture of quantum fields , this is not completely unphysical .",
    "this type of lorentz violation could therefore be relevant even for the electro - weak scale phenomena .",
    "further examinations on the model suggest the possibility that slv may again generate an effective field theory equivalent to a lorentz - invariant one .",
    "besides lorentz violation , another remarkable feature of the model is the generation of quasi - fermions , the mass spectrum of which coincides with a leptonic doublet .",
    "this observation suggests that the existence of leptons may be a result of slv .",
    "we then extend the result to quarks to have a unified picture of various fermions in nature .",
    "furthermore , since slv is naturally associated with massless nambu - goldstone vector bosons , we are led to consider whether these bosons are interpretable as photons and gluons .",
    "we examine this view to find an alternative explanation of the origin of color degrees of freedom as well as of quark - gluon confinement .",
    "though the lorentz - violating term can be eliminated by the local phase transformation , it is cpt - violating and therefore will influence the discussion of the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we show that , if this term is effective , the lorentz violation magnitude of the presented model is just of an appropriate order to reproduce the observed value of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "we first construct a chiral doublet from left- and right - handed weyl spinors : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the charge conjugate of a right - handed weyl spinor .",
    "this choice of a left - handed doublet is not essential for the argument in this section , though it has significance for the argument of baryon asymmetry .",
    "the dynamics of the doublet is specified by the lagrangian @xmath2 where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the su(2 ) generators . can be expressed by a four - component spinor , though not a dirac one .",
    "then each @xmath5 takes a block diagonal form as a @xmath6 matrix , while each @xmath7 takes the form of the pauli matrix , provided that its elements are multiplied by a @xmath8 unit matrix . ]",
    "@xmath9 is the field strength of su(2 ) gauge potentials and @xmath10 expresses the su(2 ) current .",
    "the mass term of vector bosons has been implicitly supposed to be generated spontaneously .",
    "ordinarily , perturbation theory divides @xmath11 into a free part @xmath12 and an interaction part @xmath13 , where @xmath14 this division is conventional and we may divide @xmath11 into @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 analogously to the renormalization method by counter terms .",
    "we show that the self - consistency equation for the fermion self - energy has a non - trivial solution when @xmath18 , the  mass term \" @xmath19 is added to @xmath11 in ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "the physical mass matrix is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fermion self - energy correction .",
    "if we want to calculate perturbations in terms of the physical quantity from the beginning , it is convenient to replace @xmath22 by @xmath23 and to treat @xmath24 as a free part and @xmath25 as perturbations .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is determined by the condition that the fermion self - energy correction should vanish . if the mass matrix has a purely dynamical origin , then @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which reproduce ( [ l_12 ] ) . in this case , the requirement for vanishing the self - energy correction turns into the self - consistency condition for @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , if the self - consistency equation based on the division ( [ l_12 ] ) allows a non zero value for @xmath28 , this implies that lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken , the origin of fermion mass is purely dynamical , and the vacuum is in a superconductive - type phase with a gap in the excitation spectrum . ]",
    "if the dynamics of quasi - fermions is governed by the free lagrangian @xmath15 , the current @xmath29 develops the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath30 is a @xmath6 matrix and the  tr \" in ( [ vevofcurrent ] ) is taken over the @xmath6 matrix in the parentheses .",
    "this implies that the trace is taken over both spin and isospin indices .",
    "the symbol @xmath31 takes the value 0 for @xmath32 , while it takes the value @xmath33 for a spacial index @xmath34 . ] where the lorentz scalar @xmath35 is a quadratically divergent integral that can be estimated as @xmath36 in terms of the 3-momentum cut - off @xmath37 .",
    "we have estimated ( [ vevofcurrent ] ) by expanding it with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "the self - energy is calculated as follows .",
    "the feynman diagram method represents @xmath38 as a tadpole graph , which would be quadratically divergent .",
    "loop diagrams other than tadpoles contribute to the self - energy at most logarithmically divergent quantities , which are comparatively negligible .",
    "contributions from self - interactions will effectively survive when the 4-point vertex couples to three tadpoles .",
    "since a tadpole carries no momentum , the contribution from the 3-point vertex coupled to two tadpoles will vanish .",
    "taking into account the above considerations , we have the self - energy @xmath39 : @xmath40-\\bar{m}_l=0 . \\label{selfenergy}\\ ] ] the inversion of ( [ selfenergy ] ) under the assumption @xmath41 gives @xmath42 combining ( [ selfconsistency ] ) with ( [ vevofcurrent ] ) , we have @xmath43 or @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",

    "a comparison of the mass parameter @xmath51 with the observed masses of leptons and quarks reveals that the value @xmath52 is extremely close to @xmath53 in general : @xmath54 for leptonic doublets .",
    "only the quark doublet of the third generation is exceptional , for which @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath57 also develops a vacuum expectation value through the first- and higher - order perturbation corrections .",

    ". however , as presently discussed , there is a combined symmetry left , which is an appropriate combination of a global su(2 ) and a spacial rotation leaving @xmath31 invariant . ]",
    "incidentally , we may approximately invert ( [ vevofa_mu ] ) in the following form @xmath61 which is rather an exact relation and nothing but the vacuum expectation value of the equations of motion for su(2 ) gauge potentials : @xmath62    we can further show that the vacuum @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 is energetically more favorable than the normal one @xmath66 with @xmath67 . actually , the equations of motion reduce the vacuum expectation value of the energy density @xmath68 in the form @xmath69\\\\ & \\ \\ \\",

    "it may be worth mentioning that the vev of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath72 does not contribute to the source of gravity , viewed from the point of view of an observer on the true vacuum @xmath63 , since what is physically observable is only the deviation from the vacuum .",
    "one may wonder why the clear evidence of slv has remained unnoticed for so long a time , though the model belongs to a type with which we are well acquainted .",
    "this possibility requires the acceptance of the cut - off @xmath37 as the fundamental scale of energy .",
    "for example , in numerical simulations , @xmath37 corresponds to the inverse of the lattice spacing @xmath73 .",
    "however , in renormalizable theories , reliable results are expected to be obtained by an extrapolation : @xmath74 . then the results depending sensitively on a variation of @xmath73 would be regarded as unphysical .",
    "therefore , it would not be surprising if this type of solution should drop out of a researcher s view .",
    "we examine the properties of the quasi - fermions obtained in the previous section , which are characterized by the free lagrangian @xmath15 .",
    "the equation of motion dictates 4-momentum @xmath75 to satisfy @xmath76 from which we have four solutions @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "a solution with the negative branch of the square root corresponds to the particle energy spectrum unbounded below .",
    "the possible instability of the vacuum is avoided by adapting the hole interpretation to this solution .",
    "then we have dispersion relations for quasi - fermions and quasi - anti - fermions @xmath79 where the lower sign corresponds to a quasi - anti - fermion .",
    "the deviation from the ordinary dispersion law is characterized by the extra potential terms @xmath80 .",
    "if they are absent , the quasi - fermion doublet will be identifiable as an ordinary leptonic doublet .",

    "should not be confused with @xmath83 in ( [ vevofa_mu ] ) and ( [ mbya ] ) , where @xmath83 have non - zero values only for spacial components whereas @xmath84 do only for a time component .",
    "@xmath83 generate additive potential energies @xmath80 for quasi - electrons and quasi - neutrinos as seen from ( [ leptondr ] ) . in order to reproduce these terms in the dirac spinor representation ,",
    "it is suffice to introduce a constant vector potential @xmath84 with only a non - vanishing time component .",
    "] we here recognize that the extra potential term @xmath84 is lorentz- and cpt - violating .",
    "however , the constant vector potential is eliminable by the local phase transformations @xmath85 in this sense , the quasi - fermions are equivalent to ordinary neutrinos and electrons .",
    "it is worth noting that the quasi - electron mass originates from the spontaneous lorentz violation of a chiral model .",
    "since the construction of the mass term in the effective field theory needs both left- and right - handed spinors , this implies that the right - handed quasi - electron is generated by only the left - handed primary fermions , which seems impossible in the case of spontaneous breaking of gauge ( non space - time ) symmetries .",
    "this phenomenon is understood by the concept that the vacuum provides the requisite spin to the quasi - electron .",
    "in contrast to ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking , the vacuum @xmath63 has a vectorial nature . to see this",
    ", we denote the annihilation operators of the primary fermions and anti - fermions with momentum @xmath86 by @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the upper component of @xmath89 , and by @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the lower component .",
    "then , by expanding the operator @xmath89 in terms of both the primary and the quasi - fermion basis we find the relations @xmath92 where @xmath93 the subsidiary operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 are defined by @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the polar coordinates of momentum @xmath86 .",

    "we find from ( [ omega ] ) that the vacuum is composed of vectorial cooper pairs with spin @xmath53 as expected , which contrasts with the njl @xcite and bcs @xcite theories constructed on the scalar cooper pairs .    a left - handed spinor multiplied by a global vector field @xmath100 transforms as a right - handed one , where @xmath101",
    "however , in order that @xmath100 acquires independent dynamical degrees of freedom , @xmath102 should be a zero mode of some dynamical vector field .",
    "on the other hand , if all the right - handed quasi - fermions , including quasi - quarks discussed presently , are generated by coupling to some zero momentum vector boson , this boson should not be coupled with quasi - neutrinos .",
    "considering that all the massive fermions in nature have electric charges , whereas massless neutrinos have no electric charge , the property of the required vector boson appears to coincide with that of a photon .",
    "then it is expected that the model should dynamically generate electromagnetic - type interactions . a further discussion on this point is given in the following section .",
    "we next examine whether the above results are extensible also to quarks .",
    "we therefore consider the mass matrix of the general form @xmath103 three constant 4-vectors @xmath104 constitute the core of the mass matrix .",
    "we further assume that all the time - components of @xmath104 are equal to zero : @xmath105 . then the core forms a parallelepiped in 3d space .",
    "the dynamics of free quasi - fermions is determined by the lagrangian @xmath106 the equation of motion dictates the four - momentum @xmath75 to satisfy @xmath107 where @xmath108 the unit vector @xmath109 is parallel to the momentum @xmath86 : @xmath110 .",
    "the geometrical meanings of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 are the root mean squares of edges , faces , and the volume of the core , respectively .",
    "we also note that the dispersion relation ( [ gdl ] ) is invariant under an su(2 ) transformation of the mass matrix : @xmath114    four solutions of eq.([gdl ] ) have the asymptotic forms @xmath115 where @xmath116 the positivity of @xmath117 is immediately verified if the rotational invariance of the expression ( [ m_q ] ) is taken into account .",
    "then the same argument on the negative square root solutions gives , for quasi - fermions and quasi - anti - fermions , the dispersion relations @xmath118 the extra energy @xmath119 corresponds to the term @xmath120 for quasi - leptons",
    ". we may call it the fermi potential in general , since it suggests a correspondence with the fermi energy or the chemical potential .    the potential term and",
    "the quasi - fermion masses are generally not constant but depend on the direction of motion .",
    "the averaged potential @xmath121 and the averaged masses @xmath122 satisfy the relations @xmath123 or @xmath124 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath125{v_m}/l_m$ ] , which characterizes how close the core comes to a cubic form .",
    "the fermi potential and masses become constant only when three mass vectors are orthogonal and have the same length : @xmath126 with @xmath127 , which is the same thing , when the core becomes a cube . in this case",
    ", the mass matrix reduces to the leptonic form @xmath28 by an appropriate su(2 ) transformation . the mass parameters @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath128 differ only by sign : @xmath129 .",
    "then eq.([gdl ] ) has exact solutions ( [ leptonem ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the leptonic case , quasi - fermions with a mass matrix of non - cubic type are not solutions to the self - consistency equation ( [ selfenergy ] ) , or ( [ inversion ] ) combined with ( [ vevofcurrent ] ) , at least in the same order of approximation . however , even if quasi - fermions of this type are regarded as quarks , anisotropy would not immediately contradict the observations , since quarks are permanently confined in bound states .",
    "if the anisotropic quasi - fermions are also allowable as solutions for the self - consistency equation , they would imply spontaneous breaking of spacial symmetry .",
    "then interactions mediated by nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the breakdown of rotational symmetry will emerge . accordingly , anisotropic quasi - fermions will have other interactions than those which quasi - leptons have .",
    "we will clarify the nature of this new interaction and the relationship to the strong interactions in the next section to find that the anisotropic quasi - fermions are well qualified to be regarded as quarks .    as a result ,",
    "the model leads us to regard leptons and quarks observed in nature as members of quasi - fermion doublets . in this view",
    "the quantity @xmath130 will serve to characterize various weak doublets .",
    "three generations of leptonic doublets have @xmath131 , while the quark doublets have @xmath1320.8434 , 0.9958 , and 0.9996 for the first , second , and third generations , where @xmath133 is assumed for the first generation .",
    "it is clear that @xmath130 is very close to 1 for all the quark and leptonic doublets , except for the quark doublet of the first generation . in particular ,",
    "@xmath130 for a quark doublet approaches the value of 1 more closely with higher generations . taking into account the asymptotic freeness ,",
    "this tendency is consistent with the view that the absence of a massless component in a quark doublet may be due to the effects of strong interactions .",
    "incidentally , the reversal of the signs of three mass vectors reveres the sign of @xmath134 .",
    "this operation is equivalent to reversing the sign of @xmath119 in ( [ asdr ] ) . for a cubic core",
    ", this implies to a change in the sign of @xmath51 .",
    "quasi - fermions with the same masses but opposite fermi potentials may be called reciprocal fermions , which exist on another vacuum distinct from the original .",
    "compared with the standard theory , the model presented in sect.[slv ] , which consists of a chiral doublet interacting only with massive su(2 ) gauge bosons , seems to lack electromagnetic and strong interactions .",
    "moreover , due to chiral gauge anomaly , it appears difficult to incorporate u(1 ) and su(3 ) gauge interactions with a chiral model .",
    "however , the spontaneous breakdown of global su(2 ) and lorentz symmetries are expected to generate massless bosons @xcite .",
    "we presently show that these bosons are vector mesons",
    ". then the question arises of whether photons and gluons can be interpreted as nambu - goldstone vector mesons .",
    "we first consider the case of spontaneous generation of a quasi - leptonic doublet to see that the ng bosons in this case are vector bosons .    in the historical papers on spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , the dynamical generation of a massless meson",
    "is proven by calculating the meson propagator in the ladder approximation , which consists of a chain of vacuum polarization diagrams .",
    "the corresponding calculation in our case is similar to that of the vacuum polarization correction of the massive su(2 ) gauge boson propagator .",
    "if we assume the vanishing quasi - electron mass for simplicity , the vacuum polarization with zero momentum transfer @xmath135 is given by @xmath136 from which we find for the meson mass squared @xmath137@xmath138 owing to the relation ( [ ce ] ) with @xmath139 .",
    "this result suggests the emergence of a triplet of massless vector mesons .",
    "though the vanishment of mass is an approximate result , it will be rigorously proved by an argument analogous to the goldstone theorem @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the noether current for su(2 ) symmetry satisfying @xmath140=0 is given by @xmath141 in the feynman gauge .",

    "we find that these bosons are identical to the massless vector mesons appearing in ( [ massofnjl ] ) .",
    "actually , the term @xmath145 is supplied by the vertex correction shown in fig.1(c ) : @xmath146 from which we have eq . ( [ lvp ] ) .",
    "the sub diagrams in fig .",

    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "the massless vector mesons coupled with the conserved abelian currents are well qualified to be regarded as photons , provided that they are a single current , not a triplet of currents .",
    "we here call them quasi - photons .    in the previous section , we have argued that , in order for a chiral fermion to have mass , it needs to absorb a photon - like vector boson .",
    "we imagine here that it would be a phenomenon like the higgs mechanism .",
    "then , it is understandable that the masses of a quasi - fermion doublet require plural photon - like vector fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the nature of quasi - fermions is su(2 ) invariant in the sense of eq.([su(2)equivalence ] ) , from which we also understand that the triplet of quasi - photons will exert degenerate actions on quasi - fermions .",

    "the dispersion relations of the quasi - fermions differ considerably from ordinary ones in two respects : one is the existence of an additional potential term and the other is the anisotropy appearing in the case of quasi - quarks .",
    "we have already seen that the extra potential term is eliminable in the effective theory by the local phase transformation .",
    "consequently , the effect of lorentz violation is removable for quasi - leptons .    concerning quasi - quarks ,",
    "the anisotropy should vanish for the configuration of the vacua that cancel their anisotropy .",
    "accordingly , the quasi - quarks confined in meson or baryon states will allow an isotropic representation in the effective field theory . in this case , if the averaged masses and the potentials are assigned to quasi - quarks in the isotropic representation , then their effective free lagrangian will be transformed into a lorentz - invariant form by appropriate local phase transformations .    in this sense , the effective free lagrangian for quasi - leptons and quasi - quarks will become equivalent to the lorentz - invariant one .",
    "we next consider the lorentz invariance of the interactions .",
    "we have already seen that , from massive su(2 ) interactions , slv generates quasi - photons and quasi - gluons , which mediate forces analogous to the electromagnetic and strong interactions .",
    "lorentz invariance with respect to the interactions is viewed as realized in a form incorporating the primary and secondary interactions , since the secondary interactions emerge in order to play the role of maintaining , at the level of matrix elements , the lorentz - invariant conservation laws of the primary interactions currents .    in this sense",
    ", it is expected that slv does not really break lorentz invariance , but simply changes the representation of lorentz invariance in terms of particles and forces .",
    "we then reach an inference that the effective theory generated by spontaneous lorentz violation can be still equivalent to the lorentz - invariant one . in this case , the magnitude of lorentz - violating parameters appearing in the effective theory will not be directly constrained by the observational lorentz invariance .",
    "we do not pursue further the examination of the lorentz invariance of the effective theory here .",
    "more detailed arguments are given in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "our construction of a unified model of fermions satisfies the requirements for baryon and lepton asymmetries in cosmology .",
    "the baryon - number - violating interaction constitutes the first of sakhalov s criteria @xcite , which are thought to be inevitable for baryon asymmetry@xcite .",
    "the model presented in sect.[slv ] breaks the primary fermion number @xmath201 , but conserves the quasi - fermion number @xmath202 , which is analogous to the baryon minus lepton number @xmath203 in the su(5 ) model@xcite . as a result",
    ", our scheme replaces the baryon number violation with the primary fermion number violation , which is rather favorable in view of the stability of baryons .",
    "in addition to the fermion - number - violating interaction , the sakhalov s criteria demand cp violations .",
    "the spontaneous lorentz violation also serves in this respect . as seen in sect.[lq ] ,",
    "the vacuum expectation values of su(2 ) gauge potentials provide not only masses for quasi - fermions , but also large cpt - violating fermi potentials .",
    "the sakhalov s last criterion , the existence of thermal - non - equilibrium , is also naturally provided by the phase transition from primary to quasi - fermions .    as an examination on this subject",
    ", we consider a primordial quasi - fermion doublet created during the phase transition , which would transmute into a quasi - quark doublet and a quasi - leptonic doublet with branching ratios @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively .",

    "the quasi - fermion asymmetry @xmath212 is defined by @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is the number density of photons . then the primordial  up \" and  down \" quasi - quark asymmetries @xmath215 , the charged quasi - lepton asymmetry @xmath216 and the quasi - neutrino asymmetry @xmath217 generated at the critical temperature @xmath218 are given by @xmath219,\\\\    \\eta_-=&\\displaystyle\\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\zeta(3)}\\mu\\beta_c r \\left[1-(\\frac{\\mu\\beta_c}{\\pi})^2(2 - 3\\gamma^3)\\right],\\\\    \\eta_l'=&\\displaystyle-\\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\zeta(3)}\\mu\\beta_c ( 1-r ) \\left[1 - 5(\\frac{\\mu\\beta_c}{\\pi})^2\\right],\\\\    \\eta_\\nu'=&\\displaystyle\\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\zeta(3)}\\mu\\beta_c ( 1-r ) \\left[1+(\\frac{\\mu\\beta_c}{\\pi})^2\\right],\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{ba}\\ ] ] where we have used the second relation in ( [ dminmuandgamma ] ) and assumed that the fermi potentials are common for the primordial quasi - quark doublet and the primordial quasi - leptonic doublet : @xmath220 . , according to the unified picture of fermions proposed here and the asymptotic freeness of strong interactions , it can be imagined that , at a high energy scale , the properties of a quark doublet would approach those of a leptonic doublet .",
    "then the primordial quasi - fermion doublet would be nearly leptonic , @xmath221",

    "the sign of the fermi potential has been determined so that the sign of the resultant baryon asymmetry becomes positive .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath204 may be obtained by requiring the charge neutrality of emergent fermions : @xmath222 which is approximately guaranteed by @xmath223 then we have the baryon asymmetry @xmath224    as the universe cools down to @xmath225mev , all the anti - quarks and anti - leptons would disappear and the remaining fermions would be only protons , neutrons , electrons , and neutrinos . the electron asymmetry @xmath226 and the neutrino asymmetry @xmath227 , which includes all types of neutrinos , are determined at this epoch by conservations of the electric charge and the lepton number : @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the @xmath230 ratio .",
    "we take the temperature of the electro - weak phase transition as the critical temperature @xmath231 . in the standard model where",

    "then we find the weak boson mass @xmath236 at temperature @xmath237 , where @xmath238 if we further assume for the primordial quasi - quark doublet @xmath131 and equate the mass parameter @xmath51 with the mass of the @xmath239 lepton , then @xmath240mev , from which we have @xmath241 at temperatures below @xmath242mev , @xmath243 annihilation is expected to have increased @xmath244 by @xmath245 times @xcite . accordingly",
    ", the value of the present baryon asymmetry will be @xmath246 times smaller than the value given by ( [ evofba ] ) , which equals @xmath247 .",
    "this value is comparable with that obtained from observations : @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "the quasi - fermion picture offers a rather natural basis for flavor mixings , since all the fundamental fermions are various collective excitation modes of common primary fermions .",
    "we here consider leptons as an example , and consider the mixing @xmath249 , where @xmath250 .",
    "then @xmath251 since the relations ( [ bt ] ) show that all the @xmath252 operators are the same . from the asymptotic behaviors @xmath253 we find @xmath254\\simeq\\exp\\left[-\\frac{v(\\delta m)^2\\lambda}{16\\pi^3}\\right ] , \\label{degeneracy}\\ ] ] where @xmath255 .",
    "conventionally , the neutrino oscillations are explained by postulating neutrino mixings and small masses of neutrinos .",
    "there are arguments that lorentz violation could be the origin of the phenomenon , though without specifying the underlying theory that generates the effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation based on the intrinsic nature of quasi - neutrinos is given in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "the unified picture of fermions also provides suggestions on the number of generations .    as shown in sect .",
    "[ pg ] , the ladder approximation of ng meson propagators is based on the vacuum polarization diagram and shows the existence of the massless vector mesons interpreted as quasi - photons .",
    "inversely , if gluons have an analogous origin , the mass of quasi - gluons will be calculable by similar diagrams to the vacuum polarization of su(3 ) yang - mills gauge bosons , which in turn depends on the number of quasi - quark triplets .    in the case of su(n )",
    "yang - mills theory , the one - loop approximation gives the vacuum polarization @xmath256+o(g^4)\\\\ & = \\displaystyle\\frac{g^2}{2}k_1[2n - f_n]+o(g^4 ) , \\end{array } \\label{mofsu(n)}\\ ] ] for @xmath257 , where @xmath258 , and @xmath259 is the number of @xmath260-plets of chiral fermions .",
    "the first term @xmath261 in the upper parentheses is a contribution from the gauge boson loop made up of two 3-point vertices , @xmath262 from the ghost loop and @xmath263 from the loop made by the 4-point vertex .",
    "these values are obtained in the feynman gauge .",
    "the landau gauge gives for each @xmath264 , @xmath262 and @xmath265 , respectively , though the total is the same as in the feynman gauge .    in the yang - mills theory the dimensional regularization estimates @xmath266 as zero , which implies that @xmath267 is irrelevant for the correction of yang - mills gauge boson propagator .",
    "however , @xmath267 is the essential part for the meson propagator .",
    "gluons correspond to @xmath268 .",
    "massless quasi - gluons require @xmath269 , namely 6 chiral flavors , or six quasi - quarks , which suggests that the number of generations is three .",
    "we have supposed in our model that the mass of su(2 ) gauge bosons is generated spontaneously , presumably by the higgs mechanism .",
    "if we suppose instead that it could be generated by the same mechanism as quasi - gluons , then we see from ( [ mofsu(n ) ] ) with @xmath270 that weak bosons with mass squared @xmath271 require @xmath272 , which also implies three generations for the primary chiral doublets .",
    "the principles and conceptual foundations for a unified picture of fermions suggested by the spontaneous lorentz violation of a chiral su(2 ) model are that the primary fermions that would generate leptons and quarks constitute a chiral doublet composed of a left - handed and the charge - conjugate of a right - handed weyl spinor , and that the primary interactions would be su(2 ) gauge interactions only .",
    "then spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to weak interactions and induces subsequent spontaneous violations of the global su(2 ) invariance and rotational symmetry , which will in turn generate electromagnetic- and strong - type interactions .",
    "the lorentz- and cpt - violating terms appearing in dispersion relations of quasi - leptons can be absorbed by the local phase transformations in the effective field theory .",
    "then the possibility of observing phenomena showing the effect of lorentz violation is expected to be extremely rare .    on the other hand ,",
    "if cpt - violating terms are effective , they will have significance on the thermal equilibrium states of various quasi - fermions and therefore on the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the color degrees of freedom inherent in quarks finds their origin as the degeneracy of the vacua in rotational states .",
    "according to this interpretation , the lorentz invariance of the effective theory requires that quasi - quarks and quasi - gluons should be confined in meson and baryon states .",
    "the observed number of generations are also suggestive in view of the presented picture ; the structure of the standard theory may originate from slv .",
    "this paper does not intend to prove that the presented model induces , after spontaneous lorentz violation , an effective theory that is equivalent to the standard model .",
    "instead , we point out the possibility that , even from a simple model , spontaneous lorentz violation generates an almost lorentz invariant effective theory possessing variety and complexity extremely analogous to the standard model . this observation will shed new light on the unified theory arguments .",
    "if we hypothesize the equivalence . then we obtain as a consequence baryon asymmetry that coincides well with reality .",
    "a detailed examination of the true properties of the effective theory emergent from the presented model is in itself very interesting , but still remains to be done .",
