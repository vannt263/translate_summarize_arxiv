    "local realism  the assumption that physical quantities have well established values previous to any measurement and that signals can not travel faster than the speed of light  entails limits on the correlations which space - like separated , independent observers may obtain .",
    "such restrictions , usually expressed as bell inequalities  @xcite , may be surpassed within quantum theory when the observers share certain entangled quantum states .",
    "the correlations then can not be explained by any local hidden variable ( lhv ) model , and are hence labeled nonlocal correlations .",
    "the experimental evidence for the existence of nonlocal correlations is compelling yet not completely conclusive .",
    "existing tests all suffer from one or more loopholes , which open up lhv explanations of the data unless further assumptions are introduced . in some cases ,",
    "the measurements are not sufficiently fast or far apart to be space - like separated events  @xcite .",
    "in other cases , low detection efficiency is the obstacle .",
    "for example , in bell tests based on photon pairs  @xcite , low photodetection efficiencies imply that in many experimental runs , at least one photon is lost . analysing only the coincidence counts",
    ", nonlocal correlations may be observed even when the total dataset can be explained by a lhv model . an additional fair - sampling assumption is therefore required to reject local realism in experiments with low detection efficiency . while this may seem natural , albeit slightly dissatisfactory , in experiments probing the nature of quantum mechanics , it is incompatible with device independent applications for which the violation of a bell inequality is a necessary condition to assure e.g.  security of certain tasks  @xcite .",
    "for example , a malicious eavesdropper could take advantage of detection inefficiency to break a device - independent key distribution protocol without being detected .",
    "the robustness of bell test violations to loss and inefficiencies depends on the particular test and setup . to achieve efficiency thresholds compatible with those of laboratory detectors , various approaches",
    "have been considered , e.g.  changing the number of settings , outcomes and parties  @xcite , as well as the detection schemes and types of states  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as first noted by eberhard  @xcite , the state providing better robustness against losses , is not necessarily the most entangled . for the chsh inequality ,",
    "corresponding to 2 parties , 2 settings , and 2 outcomes , a critical efficiency of 67% is achieved by an almost separable state .",
    "however , such a state is very susceptible to noise , and hence not terribly practical in experiment .",
    "recently , asymmetric setups have attracted attention .",
    "asymmetry in the efficiency of different measurement settings is motivated by the fact that the measurements which can be efficiently performed do not necessarily coincide with those yielding a high bell test violation .",
    "for example , homodyne detection of light can be extremely efficient , but it seems very difficult to obtain good violations based solely on homodyning  @xcite . combining homodyning and single - photon detection , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors obtain a threshold of 71% for single - photon detection .",
    "this is higher than for the eberhard scheme , however the required state is not close to separable and seems feasible to prepare .",
    "asymmetry between parties is motivated by the natural occurence of entanglement between different physical systems , such as atoms and photons , for which the available detection schemes have widely different efficiencies .",
    "atomic states can be measured with almost unit efficiency .",
    "nonlocality tests for atom - photon systems have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a critical single - photon detection efficiency of 45% was obtained , and very recently in ref .",

    ", we consider general asymmetric bell tests , based on multipartite w - states @xcite .",
    "the physical implementation we have in mind is a single photon shared between multiple parties , and possibly entangled with an additional atomic system .",
    "however our analysis is applicable also to a wider qubit setting .",
    "the motivation for focusing on nonlocality tests based on w - states is threefold : the simplicity of preparing single - photon w - states , the robustness of w - state entanglement against losses , and the existence of bell inequality violations which rapidly approaches the algebraic maximum for an increasing number @xmath0 of parties .    in the following sections we first discuss optical w - states and examine concrete measurements schemes in sec .",
    "[ sec.physical ] .",
    "we introduce a povm model capturing a broad range of detection imperfections and loss in sec .",

    "[ sec.bell ] and [ sec.polytope ] we explore the robustness of nonlocality for the w - state by means of specific bell inequalities and linear programming respectively .",
    "we demonstrate , using the bell inequality proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the local content of the w - state tends exponentially fast to zero for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this , and the fact that the entanglement in the state has a very robust ( size - independent ) resistance to losses  @xcite , would seem to suggest that there could be an advantage to increasing @xmath0 in tests of nonlocality .",
    "however , we show that this is not the case for several concrete examples where the robustness actually decreases with @xmath0 , while in other cases which we have examined , only slight improvements with @xmath0 are found . at the same time the threshold scaling , for the cases with no improvements ,",
    "is not severe .",
    "this is positive , since multipartite nonlocality is important in its own right and useful in several information processing tasks  @xcite .",
    "the w - state for @xmath0 parties , each a 2-dimensional quantum system , can be taken to be @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 denote the eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath4 , @xmath5 respectively of the pauli operator @xmath6 . in a purely optical implementation , ( [ eq.w ] ) can be created by coherently distributing a single photon among @xmath0 parties . heralded single photons can be generated e.g.  via spontaneous parametric down conversion , and distributed by means of linear optics .",
    "measurements of @xmath6 then correspond simply to single - photon detection ( spd ) .",
    "however , measurements in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane of the bloch sphere require transformations such as @xmath9 that do not preserve energy , and hence can not be implemented perfectly with passive , linear optics",
    ". nevertheless , approximate implementations are possible as discussed below .",
    "another case we will consider is atom - photon entanglement . for single trapped atoms or ions , very high detection efficiency and good control over the measurement bases can be achieved @xcite . at the same time , through spontaneous emission , the atom can be entangled with an optical field , e.g.  in a state of the form @xmath10 , with the first mode referring to the atomic state and the second to the number of photons in the field . distributing the emitted photon over multiple modes ,",
    "one arrives at a w - state with one atomic party and @xmath11 photonic parties , that is @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes a state with all modes in @xmath2 .",
    "since the coupling @xmath14 between the atom and the emitted photon is not perfect , the actual state will be an incoherent sum of @xmath15 and @xmath16 with respective probabilities given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "an approximate implementation of @xmath19 can be achieved using the fact that in the 0 - 1 photon fock space , a homodyne measurement with phase @xmath20 and sign - binning approximates a measurement of @xmath21 , i.e.  in the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "for example , within the 0 - 1 photon fock space , the elements of the projection operator approximating @xmath19 are @xmath22 due to the non - unit factor @xmath23 the detection is not perfect . the probability to produce the correct output given",

    "the probability to observe no clicks at the detector ( in the absence of loss ) , when an eigenstate of @xmath19 is incident , is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the displacement operator and @xmath30 denotes a coherent state .",
    "thus , by choosing @xmath31 one can ensure that the state @xmath32 is faithfully detected , in the sense that it will always give a detector click , while the state @xmath33 will give a no - click outcome with probability @xmath34 . as we will see in the next section",
    "this has the same structure as an spd @xmath6-measurement .",
    "however , this choice of @xmath27 suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite is not necessarily optimal .",
    "when the single - photon detector has a non - unit efficiency @xmath35 , ( [ eq.dispp0 ] ) becomes @xmath36 the optimal choice of @xmath27 will depend on @xmath35 as well as on the bell scenario in which the approximate @xmath19-measurement is used .",
    "in any experiment , imperfections are likely to be present in the form of losses , detector inefficiencies , and noise . depending on the particular setup",
    ", these imperfections might have different effects .",
    "we imagine bell experiments in which each party chooses between measurements of the same two dichotomic observables , labeled by @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for most cases we will consider , the settings @xmath37 , @xmath38 will correspond to implementations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",

    "we capture several types of errors as we now describe in detail .",
    "one common loss - induced error occurs in experiments based on single - photon detection , where imperfect detectors lead to a decrease in the probability for observing one outcome ( click ) and an increased probability for the complementary outcome ( no click ) .",

    "such an ad channel could describe e.g.  transmission loss affecting a single - photon w - state .",

    "surprisingly , we could also show that despite of that , the robustness of the violation with respect to loss actually decreases rapidly with @xmath0 . taking a step up in terms of generality",
    ", we then considered the wwwzb - inequalities @xcite which provide a compact description of all tight bell inequalities formed only from full correlators . from these",
    "we again found that increasing @xmath0 does not necessarily lead to better loss thresholds .",
    "for example , assuming one approximate pauli measurement based on ideal homodyning and another based on imperfect single - photon detection , the best threshold is reached already for @xmath98 , giving @xmath95 . finally , we approached the w - state via the polytope of local distributions , covering all possible bell inequalities and thus taking another step up in terms of generality ( as well as numerical complexity ) . with this approach",
    ", we found that the loss thresholds for a single photon are similar to those obtained from wwwzb , though slightly better for @xmath144 . for implementations that permit the detection of loss events , such as those based on polarisation qubits , much better thresholds",
    "can be obtained , with the threshold for one basis approaching 0 when the efficiency in the complementary basis is high .",
    "we note that in the cases where increasing @xmath0 leads to unchanged or worse loss thresholds , the scaling is not severe .",
    "this is a positive result which means that multipartite nonlocality tests become feasible with only slight improvements in detection efficiencies over those required for optimal @xmath0 . as a possible extension of the results presented here",
    ", one can consider nonlocality tests involving more than a single photon and that can also be feasible prepared with current technology @xcite . also to consider more general scenarios where each party is allowed to perform more than just two measurements",
    "@xcite can be a interesting approach to obtain less demanding detection efficiencies .",
