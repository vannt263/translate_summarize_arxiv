    "recently the rare decay modes of the @xmath0 meson into light mesons , e.g. , @xmath3 , attracted much attention of theoreticians although such decays have barely been observed ( see , however , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this interest lies in the expectation that , owing to the large momentum release , such processes are amenable to a perturbative treatment .",
    "if that is the case the rates for such @xmath0 decays can be calculated in a similar fashion as for instance the large momentum transfer behavior of the pion s electromagnetic form factor .",
    "the perturbative approach would form an attractive alternative to phenomenological models based on soft physics ( e.g. , overlaps of wave functions and/or vector meson dominance @xcite ) .",
    "a reliable estimate of the rates @xmath4 for exclusive non - leptonic @xmath0 decays is also of enormous importance in the investigation of cp violation . for the decays of charged @xmath0 mesons , for instance ,",
    "one studies asymmetries between the rates of cp conjugated processes . a non - zero rate asymmetry , signaling cp violation , requires phase differences in the interfering amplitudes which may be generated by penguin diagrams .",
    "the first perturbative calculation of exclusive @xmath0 decays has been carried out by szczepaniak , henley and brodsky @xcite .",
    "other authors @xcite have repeated that analysis using similar methods . the results for the decay widths obtained by the various authors agree with each other to a certain extent .",
    "however , there is a technical difficulty which has not been solved in a satisfactory way by these authors . as a consequence of the collinear approximation used in these analyses",
    ", i.e.  of the neglect of the transverse degrees of freedom , a singularity appears in the end - point regions where one of the partons carries most of the momentum of its parent hadron .",
    "it is presumed that a sudakov factor damps the end - point regions sufficiently and a finite , stable result remains .",
    "this conjecture is taken as a justification for cutting off the end - point regions , a procedure which leads to an unwelcome strong dependence of the results on the position of the cut - off .",
    "botts and sterman @xcite have recently calculated a sudakov factor , comprising gluonic radiative corrections , for exclusive reactions in next - to - leading log approximation using resummation and renormalization group techniques .",
    "this approach necessitates the explicit consideration of the transverse degrees of freedom which , as we mentioned above , are conventionally neglected . the botts - sterman approach which may be termed the modified perturbative approach ,",
    "has already been applied to several exclusive reactions , among them is the pion s and the nucleon s electromagnetic form factor @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that the modified perturbative approach allows a reliable , theoretically self - consistent calculation of the perturbative contributions to electromagnetic form factors .",
    "previous objections @xcite against the applicability of the standard perturbative approach do not apply to the modified approach .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to perform a detailed analysis of @xmath0 decays into two @xmath1 mesons using the modified perturbative approach . as it will turn out , the above - mentioned singularity disappears , hence there is no need for cutting off the range of integration .",
    "a second advantage of the modified approach is that it allows both a simple parameter - free treatment of the strong coupling constant and a choice of an appropriate renormalization scale which keeps under control contributions from higher order perturbation theory .",
    "owing to these two advantages the modified perturbative approach provides a reliable estimate of the perturbative contributions to @xmath0 decays into two @xmath1 mesons .",
    "this will be elucidated in some detail in the body of the text .",
    "comparison with future experimental results will reveal whether the processes under investigation are indeed dominated by perturbative contributions or whether they are still under control of soft physics .",
    "it should be emphasized that of all experimentally accessible exclusive decays into hadronic final states the process @xmath5 has the largest momentum release and can therefore be considered as a hard processes best .",
    "if here the perturbative approach fails in comparison with experiment its application to other exclusive non - leptonic decay processes seems dubious .    in sec .  2 we discuss the calculation of the decay rate for the process @xmath3 within the modified perturbative approach .",
    "the numerical results and a discussion of a number of approximations made in the calculation are presented in sec .",
    "short distance corrections will be discussed in sec .  4 as well as a calculation of other @xmath5 decay modes .",
    "the weak @xmath6 transition form factors can be calculated in a similar fashion as the @xmath7 decay rates .",
    "results for transition form factors are presented in sect .",
    "the paper terminates with a few concluding remarks ( sec .",
    "6 ) . in an appendix some details about the sudakov factor are presented .",
    "we start with the process , @xmath3 , and consider the unperturbed weak hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are color labels .",
    "@xmath11 is the left - handed projection operator .",
    "@xmath12 is the usual fermi constant and @xmath13 where the @xmath14 denote the ckm matrix elements . because of the large momentum release in the decay of the @xmath0 meson into two light mesons it seems possible to apply perturbative qcd .",
    "for the same reason one may also neglect long - range final state interactions . on these premises",
    "the decay amplitude @xmath15 can be calculated along the same lines as for instance the pion s electromagnetic form factor . with the help of the factorization formula of perturbative qcd for exclusive reactions",
    "the decay amplitude is written as a convolution of meson wave functions and a hard scattering amplitude @xmath16 to be calculated from the effective hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) and , to leading order in the strong coupling constant @xmath17 , the exchange of a gluon between the spectator quark and one of the other quarks ( see figs .  1 and 2 ) . in principle",
    "there are contributions from higher fock states too where additional quarks and/or gluons appear in the mesons .",
    "such contributions will be ignored by us since they are suppressed by powers of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 denotes the mass of the @xmath0 meson ) . in order to calculate the decay amplitude we utilize the modified perturbative approach .",
    "the crucial element for incorporating the sudakov corrections in the calculation of that amplitude within the modified perturbative approach is the explicit dependence on the transverse degrees of freedoms in the convolution of wave functions and hard scattering amplitude .",
    "this convolution formula can formally be derived by using the methods described in detail by botts and sterman @xcite .",
    "adapting li and yu s result for the semi - leptonic @xmath20 transition matrix element @xcite to our case of the @xmath7 decay amplitude , the convolution formula can be written in the form @xmath21\\left[\\frac{{\\rm",

    "the full meson state is described by the product of the ( scalar ) wave function @xmath35 , a color and a flavor function of obvious form and of the spin wave function which is written in a covariant fashion @xmath39 @xmath40 is the relative momentum of quark and antiquark forming the meson @xmath38 and @xmath41 is the meson s mass . note that the relative momentum is only determined up to a multiple of the hadron s momentum @xmath42 .",

    "; it can not be calculated from first principles at the time being .",

    "to lowest order perturbation theory , it is to be calculated from the feynman graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in order to perform that calculation",
    "it is convenient to work in the rest frame of the @xmath0 meson where the hadronic momenta in light - cone coordinates read @xmath48 the quark momenta are specified in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in a possibly crude approximation ,",
    "yet well in line with the basic ideas of the parton model , we chose the relative momenta @xmath40 in such a way that they have only transverse components @xmath37 and , hence , the @xmath40 are all orthogonal to the mesonic momenta .",
    "the wave function for the @xmath0 meson is known to have a pronounced peak at @xmath49 ( @xmath50 being the @xmath51-quark mass ) .",
    "it is clear therefore that only regions close to the peak position contribute to any degree of significance .",
    "this implies , to a very good approximation , that the @xmath51-quark mass equals @xmath52 . in accord with",
    "the heavy quark effective theory it also implies equal velocities of the @xmath51-quark and of the @xmath0 meson up to corrections of order @xmath53 . since the r.m.s .",
    "transverse momentum is of the order of @xmath54 to @xmath55 these corrections can safely be ignored .",
    "the masses of the light quarks and mesons are neglected in the kinematics .    given these assumptions and approximations the denominators of the internal quark and gluon propagators in the graphs fig .",
    "2a and 2b read @xmath56 where , following previous authors , e.g. , @xcite , we neglect terms @xmath57 . if one would ignore the @xmath58-term in @xmath59 which is equivalent to the assumption @xmath60 , the denominators of the internal partons are of the same type as in the case of the pion s electromagnetic form factor with the @xmath0-meson mass playing the rle of the momentum transfer .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for momentum transfers of the order of the value of the @xmath0-meson mass perturbation theory can be applied self - consistently . in our numerical evaluations of the decay width",
    "we , however , take into account the @xmath58-term in @xmath59 .",
    "it leads to a pole within the range of integration which is handled in the usual way by using the prescription @xmath61 .",
    "this pole which corresponds to the situation of the b - quark propagator going on - shell , is not a pinched singularity and is , therefore , not associated with long distance propagations of the b quark .",
    "hence , a perturbative treatment of the pole contribution is justified @xcite . for a detailed discussion of this pole",

    "@xcite , botts and sterman @xcite have calculated the sudakov factor using resummation techniques and having recourse to the renormalization group . adapting their result to the case at hand , @xmath75",

    "the last term arises from the application of the renormalization group .",
    "the sudakov function @xmath81 , which includes leading and next - to - leading logarithms , is given explicitly in the appendix .",
    "contrary to @xcite we do not allow for a sudakov factor for the @xmath0 meson .",
    "we present the arguments for the ansatz ( [ sud ] ) in the appendix .",
    "although our treatment of the @xmath0 meson differs from that of @xcite , the numerical results are practically the same since the sudakov factor for the @xmath0 meson used in @xcite , only yields a tiny additional suppression of the perturbative contribution of the order of a few percent .",
    "following other authors @xcite we choose as the renormalization scale the largest mass scale appearing in the process @xmath82 the evaluation of the @xmath3 amplitude requires the integration over the transverse separations .",
    "this implies two angle integrations , say the integration over the directions of @xmath33 , simply providing a factor of @xmath83 , and the integration over the relative angle @xmath84 between @xmath33 and @xmath85 .",
    "the latter integration is non - trivial since the relative angle also appears in the argument of one of the bessel functions ( see ( [ eq : th - ft ] ) ) but it can be carried out analytically by means of graf s theorem @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the step function .",

    "the fact that the @xmath98-part in ( [ eq : ampl ] ) factorizes implies the factorization of non - leptonic decay amplitudes into a product of two current matrix elements @xmath99 with the first matrix element being parameterized in the usual way as @xmath100 frequently ( [ fac ] ) is used as a hypothesis in soft models for decay amplitudes .    putting all together we have the following representation of the @xmath3 amplitude @xmath101 where @xmath102 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\times \\alpha_s(\\mu)[2x - x_1 ] k_0(\\sqrt{(1-x)(1-x_1)}m_b b ) f(\\sqrt{2x - x_1 - 1}m_b , b , b_1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the color factor is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the casimir operator of the fundamental representation of @xmath105 .",
    "the remaining four dimensional integral has to be carried out numerically . before presenting the numerical results ( see sec .",
    "3 ) two remarks are in order : + i ) owing to the behavior of the @xmath69 function the hard scattering amplitude has a singularity of the type @xmath106 for @xmath107 , @xmath108 fixed . since the pion wave function provides a factor @xmath109 in that limit ( see sec .",
    "3 ) the integral in ( [ omb ] ) is regular .",
    "this result appears as a consequence of the fact that the transverse degrees of freedom are explicitly considered in the modified perturbative approach . in the standard approach @xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , the neglect of the transverse momenta ( and the assumption @xmath60 ) leads to a @xmath110 behaviour of the hard scattering amplitude ( see ( [ prop ] ) ) . hence the decay amplitude @xmath111 is logarithmically singular .",
    "that property of @xmath112 forced previous authors to cut off the @xmath113-integral at @xmath114 ( with @xmath115 being chosen to lie in the range 0.05 - 0.1 ) under the argument that the sudakov factor will suppress the end - point region .",
    "it should be clear from our discussion that the singularity of the amplitude is avoided when the transverse degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "the sudakov factor provides only further suppression of the end - point regions .",
    "in contrast to @xcite our results are therefore insensitive to the end - point regions .",
    "moreover , they do not depend on a cut - off parameter .",
    "+ ii ) for @xmath116 , @xmath117 is singular . however , as an inspection of ( [ eq : sudfct ] ) reveals , the sudakov factor tends to zero faster than any power of @xmath118 compensating the @xmath119 singularity and rendering the integral in ( [ omb ] ) finite .",
    "this is an attractive feature the modified perturbative approach possesses ; it allows to choose the renormalization scale in such a way that large logs from higher order perturbation theory are avoided and a finite result for the amplitude @xmath111 is nevertheless obtained without introducing an external parameter ( such as e.g. a gluon mass ) to regularize @xmath119 .",
    "we will take up this point again .",
    "the first step in the evaluation of that decay width is to specify the wave functions .",
    "the pion wave function is rather well - known since it is constrained by the decay processes @xmath94 and @xmath120 @xcite . in @xcite a parameterization of that wave function",
    "is given which respects these two constraints .",
    "the soft transverse configuration space wave function is written as @xmath121 for the distribution amplitude @xmath122 we use @xmath123 and , as an alternative , we use a distribution amplitude originally proposed by chernyak and zhitnitsky @xcite @xmath124 the @xmath51-dependent part @xmath125 is assumed to be a simple gaussian @xmath126 more complicated forms than ( [ eq : sigma - ft ] ) ( e.  g. , a two - humped shape of the momentum space wave function ) are proposed in @xcite on the basis of dispersion relations and duality . at large transverse momentum , however , the soft momentum space wave function should behave like a gaussian @xcite .",
    "the examination of a number of examples corroborates our expectation that forms of @xmath127 other than ( [ eq : sigma - ft ] ) will not change the results and the conclusions presented in our paper markedly .",
    "the parameter @xmath128 appearing in the gaussian has a value of @xmath129 for both the distribution amplitudes .    in @xcite",
    "it is also shown that the asymptotic ( as ) distribution amplitude combined with the gaussian ( [ eq : sigma - ft ] ) leads to a reasonable description of the @xmath130 transition form factor within the modified perturbative approach while the cz distribution amplitude seems to be in conflict with the data .",
    "we nevertheless retain that distribution amplitude since we can not exclude it definitely and in order to examine the influence of the form of the distribution amplitude on the final results .    for the @xmath0 meson",
    "we take the bauer - stech - wirbel wave function @xcite which has been proven to be useful in weak decays . writing that wave function in a fashion similar to ( [ eq : wvfct - ansatz ] ) , we have @xmath131 and @xmath132.\\ ] ] the distribution amplitude @xmath133 exhibits a pronounced peak , its position is approximately at @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "this property of the @xmath0-meson wave function parallels the theoretical expected and experimentally confirmed behaviour of heavy meson fragmentation functions .",
    "the two parameters appearing in the @xmath0-meson wave function , namely @xmath136 and @xmath137 , are fixed by normalizing the wave function to unity - the neglect of higher fock states seems to be a reasonable assumption for heavy hadrons - and by taking a value of @xmath138 for the @xmath0-meson decay constant @xmath139 .",
    "this value has been found in a recent lattice gauge theory analyses @xcite . under these conditions @xmath136 and @xmath137 have the values 63.05 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "one may be tempted to use a non - factorizing form for @xmath141 similarly to that of @xmath142 in ( [ eq : sigma - ft ] ) .",
    "however , we favor the function ( [ sigb ] ) since the non - factorizing form has theoretical deficiencies in the formal limit @xmath143 and is , therefore , in conflict with the heavy quark effective theory as has been shown in @xcite .    using a value of 0.975 for the ckm matrix element @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 , we find the following numerical results for the decay width of the process @xmath147 when either the as distribution amlitude ( [ eq : da - as ] ) or the cz one ( [ eq : da - cz ] ) is employed : @xmath148 since the ckm matrix element @xmath149 is still poorly known we tentatively take for it the value 0.005 and show @xmath149 explicitly in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "we repeat that we favor the result obtained with the asymptotic distribution amplitude and believe that the cz distribution amplitude perhaps leads to an overestimate of the perturbative contribution to the @xmath3 decay .",
    "the predictions for the decay width are also subject to errors due to uncertainties in the model parameters and assumptions leaving aside the difference between the results for the two possibilities for the pion s distribution amplitude .",
    "the influence of small modifications in the wave functions like the use of the bhl factor @xmath150 $ ] in the distribution amplitudes ( where @xmath151 is a constituent mass ) @xcite or changes in the @xmath51 dependence is rather mild , the decay width is typically altered by @xmath152 .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our results arises from the error of @xmath153 for @xmath139 quoted in @xcite .",
    "although this error is very large and , moreover , the decay width depends quadratically on @xmath139 , the resulting error for the width only amounts to about @xmath154 .",
    "this happens because of the wave function normalisation : a change in @xmath139 is accompanied by a corresponding change in @xmath137 , both changes compensate each other to a large extent . combining all uncertainties in the model parameters we estimate the error of the prediction to amount to about @xmath155 .",
    "this errors applies to both the results presented in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "the results ( [ gamma ] ) are comparable in magnitude , although in general smaller , with previous estimates of the perturbative contribution @xcite with two exceptions where substantially larger values are quoted .",
    "simma and wyler @xcite obtain their large value by adjusting the perturbative contribution to the semi - leptonic decay @xmath156 to the data and applying the normalization factor obtained by that procedure also to non - leptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "carlson and milana @xcite use the so - called peaking approximation advocated for in @xcite . in that approximation",
    "the @xmath0-meson distribution amplitude is assumed to be @xmath157 which is with respect to the shape of ( [ eq : da - b ] ) . while the peaking approximation allows one to discuss the qualitative features of the results in a rather simple fashion it numerically is not very reliable in some cases . using it in the evaluation of the decay width within our approach",
    ", we find a result which is larger by a factor of 2.7 ( for the as wave ) function than the value quoted in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that in the modified perturbative approach in which the transverse degrees of freedom and sudakov corrections are taken into account , the soft end - point regions are strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore , there is no need for an cut - off parameter in the @xmath113 integration as it is the case in the previous perturbative calculations of the @xmath158 decay width @xcite .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of the results to the region near @xmath159 found by these authors has completely disappeared in our approach .",
    "there is second advantage in our approach : we can make use of the standard one - loop formula for the strong coupling constant .",
    "moreover , we can choose the renormalization scale as to avoid large logs from higher order perturbation theory ( see ( [ ren ] ) ) .",
    "still the integral appearing in ( [ omb ] ) is regular since the sudakov factor compensates the @xmath17 singularity .",
    "actually the suppression of the end - point regions is so strong that the bulk of the perturbative contribution is accumulated in regions where @xmath17 is small . in order to demonstrate that we cut off in ( [ omb ] ) regions",
    "where @xmath17 exceeds a given value @xmath160 and plot @xmath161 as a function of @xmath160 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 @xmath162 of the result is already accumulated in regions where @xmath17 is smaller than about 0.5 .",
    "the result saturates for @xmath163 , there are practically no contributions from regions where @xmath17 is larger than that value .",
    "therefore , we consider the perturbative contribution to the decay amplitude as theoretically self - consistent .",
    "note that the regions of large values of @xmath17 correspond to large quark - antiquark separations in the mesons . the use of the one - loop formula for @xmath17 ( as well as the parameterization of the parton propagators ) in the end - point regions may be questioned . however",
    ", the saturation property of the perturbative result tells us that @xmath17 can be frozen in at a value @xmath164 or regularized by , say , the introduction of a gluon mass without changing the final results . in order to avoid the introduction of such external parameters we keep the standard @xmath17 parameterization , being conscious of the fact that the actual parameterization is of no account in the soft end - point regions .",
    "it has been shown ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) that leading order short distance corrections lead to an effective hamiltonian at the scale @xmath66 @xmath165 replacing the weak hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the operators @xmath167 are given as follows @xmath168 where @xmath169 denotes the right - handed projection operator and @xmath170 is running over the quark flavors being active at the scale @xmath66 .",
    "the wilson coefficients at the scale @xmath171 are @xmath172 .",
    "the renormalization group evolution from the scale @xmath173 to @xmath174 , relevant to the @xmath0 decays , leads to the following values of the wilson coefficients at the latter scale @xcite : @xmath175 at the scale @xmath171 ( [ ham6 ] ) reduces to the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) ; after fierz reordering the operator @xmath176 is the one appearing in ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "taking into account the hamiltonian ( [ ham6 ] ) in the calculation of @xmath0 decays into two pions , we have to consider many contributions .",
    "there is , on the one side , the class of direct contributions where the @xmath177 quark together with the spectator quark forms one of the pions .",
    "a second class contains the exchanged contributions where the @xmath177 quark forms a pion together with one of the other light quarks . due to fierz reordering , however , the exchanged contributions can be brought into the form of the contributions from the first class , with eventually different color factors and/or wilson coefficients .",
    "consequently , we have only to work out three dirac traces and hence three integrals corresponding to the graphs shown in figs .  2a , 2c and 2d . as we mentioned in sect",

    "are @xmath0 decays into channels involving @xmath238 mesons since the branching ratios for these processes are typically two orders of magnitude larger than the upper bound for the @xmath3 branching ratio .",
    "this enhancement is essentially due to the fact that now the ckm matrix element @xmath239 is involved instead of the much smaller matrix element @xmath149 .",
    "a treatment of such channels within the modified perturbative approach is justified since , in contrast to the standard approach , the relevant parton virtualities are sufficiently large , and correspondingly @xmath17 is small enough , thanks to the transverse degrees of freedom ( see ( [ prop ] ) and ( [ ren ] ) ) . in the light of our experience with the @xmath236 channels and backed by explorative studies we do not expect that the perturbative contributions to the channels involving @xmath238 mesons are large enough to account for the experimental values .",

    "the range of validity of ( [ eq : sudfct ] ) for the sudakov function is limited to not too small values of the transverse separation of quark and antiquark in the meson .",
    "whenever @xmath254 ( i.e. , @xmath255 ) , the gluonic corrections are to be considered as higher - order corrections to the hard scattering amplitude and , hence , are not contained in the sudakov factor but are absorbed in @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , @xmath256 is assumed .",
    "similarly , the complete sudakov factor @xmath74 $ ] is set to unity , whenever it exceeds unity , which is the case in the small @xmath51 region . as @xmath51 increases the sudakov function increases as well , tending to infinity with @xmath257 .",

    "consequently , double logs do not appear and , hence , the sudakov function for the @xmath51-quark is zero . for the light quark",
    "there are still both soft and collinear divergencies .",
    "however , because of the pronounced peak the @xmath0-meson wave function exhibits , the bulk of the perturbative contribution is accumulated in regions where the momentum of the light quark is soft , i.e. , has no large component at all .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite the divergencies do not overlap in these situations .",
    "thus , also for the light quark the sudakov function is zero .",

    "because of the shape of the @xmath0-meson wave function only values of @xmath108 close to @xmath259 are relevant for which there is only a weak or even no sudakov suppression .",
    "thus , wether or not a sudakov function for the light quark in the @xmath0 meson is taken into account is irrelevant in praxis , the numerical values for the decay rates differ only by 5% .",
