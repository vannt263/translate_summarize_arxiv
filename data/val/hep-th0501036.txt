    "field theories on noncommutative spaces became very popular after the discovery that they arise in limiting cases of string theory @xcite .",
    "although from string theory s point of view there is no reason that the limit is a well - defined quantum field theory , there has been an enormous activity aiming at renormalization proofs for noncommutative quantum field theories .",
    "most of the attempts focused at the moyal plane with the associative and noncommutative product @xmath6 it turned out that the noncommutative analogs of typical field theoretical ( in particular four - dimensional ) models on the moyal plane are not renormalizable due to the uv / ir - mixing problem @xcite .",
    "the construction of dangerous non - planar graphs was made precise in @xcite where the problem was traced back to divergences in some of the hepp sectors which correspond to disconnected ribbon subgraphs wrapping the same handle of a riemann surface .",
    "recently , the renormalization of the noncommutative @xmath7-model was achieved @xcite within a wilson - polchinski renormalization scheme @xcite adapted to non - local matrix models @xcite .",
    "the renormalizable model is defined by the action functional @xmath8 & = \\int d^4x \\big ( \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_\\mu \\phi    \\star \\partial^\\mu \\phi + \\frac{\\omega^2}{2 } ( \\tilde{x}_\\mu \\phi )    \\star ( \\tilde{x}^\\mu \\phi ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\mu_0 ^ 2    \\,\\phi \\star \\phi   + \\frac{\\lambda}{4 ! } \\phi \\star \\phi",
    "\\star \\phi \\star    \\phi\\big)(x)\\ ; , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and the euclidean metric is used .    at first sight , the appearance of the translation invariance breaking harmonic oscillator potential for the @xmath0-action ( [ action ] ) might appear strange .",
    "however , the renormalization proof shows that there is a marginal interaction which corresponds to that term and as such requires its inclusion in the initial action .",
    "moreover , thanks to the oscillator potential , the action ( [ action ] ) becomes invariant under the langmann - szabo duality @xcite which exchanges position space and momentum space .",
    "we review the main ideas of the renormalization proof , in particular the analysis of ribbon graphs , in section  [ review ] .",
    "however , it must be underlined that the proof given in @xcite relies on a numerical determination of the asymptotic scaling dimensions of the propagator .",
    "our paper fills this gap by computing rigorous bounds on the propagator , at least for large enough @xmath10 .",
    "this will be done in section  [ bounds ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "our bounds permit another renormalization strategy which turns out to be much more efficient .",
    "see section  [ sec : powercounting ] .",
    "the strategy is inspired by constructive methods @xcite .",
    "the key is a scale decomposition of the propagator and an estimation procedure of the ribbon graphs which takes into account the scale attribution .",
    "the proof is carried out for the duals of the ribbon graphs , because the set of independent variables is particularly transparent in dual graphs .",
    "the methods developed in this paper will be crucial to write a constructive version of @xcite .",
    "actually the main obstacle to the construction of the usual @xmath0 model is the non - asymptotic freedom of the theory . in noncommutative @xmath11 , the parameter @xmath10 controls the uv / ir mixing .",
    "when it reaches @xmath12 , the entanglement is maximum , and the @xmath13 function vanishes @xcite . in this view , the @xmath10-region close to @xmath12 , for which we prove analytical estimates is particularly important .",
    "in order to make this paper self - contained , we review the main ideas of the renormalization proof given in @xcite for the quantum field theory associated with the action ( [ action ] ) .    in order to avoid the oscillating phase factors of the @xmath14-product in momentum space , the first step is to pass to the matrix base of the moyal plane , where the action ( [ action ] ) becomes @xmath15    & = 4\\pi^2 \\theta_1 \\theta_2 \\sum_{m , n , k , l \\in \\mathds{n}^2 } \\big (    \\frac{1}{2 } \\delta_{m , n;k , l } \\phi_{mn } \\phi_{kl } + \\frac{\\lambda}{4 ! }   \\phi_{mn }    \\phi_{nk } \\phi_{kl } \\phi_{lm}\\big)\\;. \\label{action - matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as usual , we define the quantum field theory by the partition function , which is expanded into feynman graphs .",
    "as the fields are described by matrices @xmath16 , the resulting feynman graphs are ribbon graphs build of propagators and vertices , @xmath17 the propagator @xmath18 is the inverse of the kinetic matrix @xmath19 in ( [ action - matrix ] ) .",
    "we recall the explicit formula in ( [ eq : propinit ] ) and ( [ eq : propinit - b ] ) . due to the @xmath20-symmetry of the action ,",
    "@xmath21 only if @xmath22 . matrix indices which are not determined by this index conservation or as external indices of the graph are summation indices . the corresponding index summation is possibly divergent and requires a regularization .    in @xcite",
    "the regularization consists in a smooth cut - off of the propagator indices as a function of a renormalization scale @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is smooth with @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "this implies @xmath30 only if @xmath31 $ ] . the graph is then realized by the differentiated cut - off propagators @xmath32 which regulate the index summations . at the end ,",
    "the nested integral over @xmath33 is performed within an interval characterized by mixed boundary conditions @xcite . actually",
    ", the graphs are build recursively by adding a new propagator .",
    "this allows an inductive proof of the power - counting behavior . on the other hand",
    ", one has to carefully discuss the location of the valence of the graph where one attaches a leg of the additional propagator .",
    "this discussion alone extends over 20 pages in @xcite .",
    "it is time for an example .",
    "we consider the ( planar ) one - loop four - point graph @xmath34 & = \\left\\{\\int_{\\lambda_r}^\\lambda \\frac{d\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_2 }   \\int_{\\lambda_2}^{\\lambda_0 } \\frac{d\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 }   \\sum_{p } q_{m , p+m;p+l , l}(\\lambda_2)\\ , q_{n , p+m;p+l , k}(\\lambda_1 ) \\right\\ } + \\ { \\lambda_1 \\leftrightarrow \\lambda_2\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ * & + a_{rm;ls;sk;nr}(\\lambda_r)\\;. \\label{4point}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the choice of the boundary conditions is a preliminary one which ensures _ convergent integrals at the expense of infinitely many initial data _ @xmath35 .",
    "this will be corrected later in ( [ 4point - i ] ) .",
    "one of the bounds we prove in this paper can be put in the following form @xmath36 from the remarks made after ( [ q ] ) on the range of the maximal index we conclude @xmath37 we thus estimate the summation over @xmath38 in ( [ 4point ] ) by the maximum of the propagators @xmath39 over @xmath38 and a volume factor @xmath40 from the support of the cut - off function .",
    "this shows that the integral ( [ 4point ] ) is estimated by a constant times @xmath41 .",
    "the scaling of ( [ est - q ] ) and the volume of the support of ( [ q ] ) with respect to any index seem to suggest that @xmath42-point graphs have , as in commutative @xmath7-theory , a power - counting degree @xmath43 . however , this conclusion is too early .",
    "namely , there is a problem in presence of completely inner vertices , which require additional index summations .",
    "the following graph @xmath44 entails _ four _ independent summation indices @xmath45 and @xmath46 , whereas for the power - counting degree @xmath43 we should only have three of them .",
    "it requires a more careful analysis of the scaling behavior of the propagator to show that the @xmath46-summation can actually be performed at no cost , i.e.  without a volume factor .",
    "the reason is that the propagators show some sort of quasi - locality which implies that the contribution of a propagator @xmath47 to a graph is strongly suppressed if @xmath48 is large .",
    "thus , taking for given @xmath49 the entire sum over @xmath50 does not change the power - counting behavior , @xmath51    the two bounds ( [ est - q ] ) and ( [ est - q1 ] ) together ensure the expected power - counting behavior for all _ planar _ ribbon graphs .",
    "but ( [ est - q1 ] ) does even more : it ensures the _ irrelevance of all non - planar graphs_. for instance , in the non - planar graphs @xmath52 the summation over @xmath46 and @xmath53 , respectively , is controlled by ( [ est - q1 ] ) , i.e.  the quasi - locality of the propagator , so that the graphs in ( [ np - graphs ] ) can be estimated without any volume factor .",
    "we recall from @xcite that the non - planarity of ribbon graphs is classified by the number @xmath54 of boundary components and the genus @xmath55 of the riemann surface on which the graph is drawn . here ,",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are the number of vertices and edges ( inner double lines ) of the graph . to determine the number @xmath58 of faces we close the external legs ,",
    "that is , we connect the outgoing arrow labelled @xmath59 of an external leg directly with its incoming arrow @xmath60 .",
    "then , @xmath58 is the number of closed single lines and @xmath54 the number of those closed lines which carry external legs .",
    "then , according to @xcite , the power - counting degree of a @xmath42-leg ribbon graph in four dimensions is @xmath61 the left graph in ( [ np - graphs ] ) has topology @xmath62 and the right graph @xmath63 .    as a result ,",
    "there remain only the planar two- and four - leg graphs which can be relevant and marginal .",
    "the quasi - locality of the propagator improves the situation in selecting only    * the planar four - leg graphs with _ constant index _ along the trajectory as marginal , * the planar two - leg graphs with _ constant index _ along the trajectory as relevant , * the planar two - leg graphs with an _ accumulated index jump of 2 _ along the trajectory as marginal .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "the trajectories are the open single lines of the graph ( before the closure which identifies the faces ) .",
    "this leaves still an infinite number of divergent graphs .",
    "however , there is a discrete taylor expansion about vanishing external indices which decomposes these divergent graphs into four relevant and marginal base functions and an irrelevant remainder .",
    "for instance , the decomposition for the marginal case @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the graph ( [ 4point ] ) reads @xmath66 & = \\bigg\\{\\int_{\\lambda}^{\\lambda_0 } \\frac{d\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_2 }   \\int_{\\lambda_2}^{\\lambda_0 } \\frac{d\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 }   \\sum_{p } \\big ( q_{m , p;p , l}(\\lambda_2)\\,q_{n , p;p , n}(\\lambda_1 )   -q_{0,p;p,0}(\\lambda_2)\\,q_{0,p;p,0}(\\lambda_1 ) \\big )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\int_{\\lambda_r}^{\\lambda } \\frac{d\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_2 }   \\int_{\\lambda_2}^{\\lambda_0 } \\frac{d\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 }   \\sum_{p }   q_{0,p;p,0}(\\lambda_2)\\,q_{0,p;p,0}(\\lambda_1 ) \\bigg\\ } + \\ { \\lambda_1 \\leftrightarrow \\lambda_2\\ } + a_{00;00;00;00;00}(\\lambda_r)\\;. \\label{4point - i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , this definition necessitates a single initial value @xmath67 which represents the normalization condition for the coupling constant .    of particular importance",
    "are the marginal two - leg graphs with an accumulated index jump by 2 , such as @xmath68 the corresponding initial value represents the normalization condition for the frequency parameter @xmath10 in the initial action ( [ action ] )",
    ". therefore , the harmonic oscillator potential must be present from the beginning in order to obtain a renormalizable model .",
    "the propagator of the noncommutative @xmath0-model in the matrix base of the @xmath69-dimensional moyal plane is given by ) and ( [ eq : propinit - b ] ) corresponds to ( a.17 ) in @xcite with @xmath70 .",
    "the often used index parameter @xmath71 in @xcite is denoted by @xmath72 . ] a positive sum @xcite , analogous to the heat - kernel or parametric @xmath71-space representation @xmath73 of the ordinary commutative propagator : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a function of @xmath10 , namely @xmath77 .",
    "indices such as @xmath78 and @xmath79 have @xmath80 non - negative components @xmath81 , one for each symplectic pair of @xmath82 . however , due to ( [ eq : propinit ] ) it is enough to prove estimations for a single component .",
    "we define the norm of an index by @xmath83 .    we know that cut - offs in the parametric representation for _ commutative _ theories are specially convenient both for perturbative and constructive renormalization . in the same spirit",
    "we will divide the integral ( [ eq : propinit ] ) into slices .",
    "first we divide it into two different regions    * @xmath84 where we expect an exponential decay in @xmath85 of order @xmath86(1 ) , * @xmath87 .",
    "this is the uv / ir region which is further sliced according to a geometric progression . for each slice",
    "we expect a scaled exponential decay .",
    "the real number @xmath88 has a carefully chosen @xmath10-dependence .",
    "then , the decomposition @xmath89 leads to the following propagator for the @xmath90 slice : @xmath91 the first slice @xmath92 is treated separately .",
    "remark that the factor @xmath93 in ( [ eq : propinit - b ] ) is the only one which prevents us from explicitly performing the @xmath79-sum .",
    "all the bounds in this paper are obtained by applying to the binomial coefficients in @xmath93 the simple overestimate @xmath94 .",

    "we see from ( [ eq : propinit - b ] ) that the propagator vanishes unless @xmath99 .",

    "in this situation the bound ( [ eq : auvir ] ) is not suitable anymore because @xmath105 and @xmath106 are of order @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",

    "it is convenient for this task to consider the dual graph for which the problem becomes analogous to an ordinary problem of momentum routing .",
    "the dual graph of a ribbon graph is obtained by associating to each face a vertex and to each vertex a face .",
    "every line bordering two neighboring faces is replaced by a line joining the two corresponding vertices of the dual graph .",
    "hence , the genus does not change under this duality .",
    "we shall write @xmath321 , @xmath322 for the number of vertices and faces of the dual graph ( dual quantities are usually distinguished by a prime ) .",
    "if the initial graph is a @xmath0-graph , i.e.  has coordination 4 at each vertex , we have @xmath323 for each face @xmath324 , where @xmath325 and @xmath326 denote the numbers of edges and external valences , respectively , which belong to @xmath327 .",
    "the coordination at the vertices of the dual graph is arbitrary .",
    "the construction of the dual of a graph goes as follows : first , for each oriented face of the original ribbon graph , draw an oriented ribbon vertex by assigning    * to a single line of a propagator of the original graph an internal valence of the dual vertex , * to an external valence of the original graph an external valence of the dual vertex ,    respecting the order according to the arrows on the trajectories . in the second step",
    "we connect the valences by the duals of the propagators of the original graph , which is obtained according to @xmath328    let us consider the following example of a ribbon graph with a single face : @xmath329 the above rules lead to the following dual vertex : @xmath330 now we connect the valences by the duals of the propagators of the original graph , i.e.@xmath331 with @xmath332 , @xmath333 with @xmath334 and @xmath335 with @xmath336 : @xmath337    the dual graph is made of the same propagators as the original graph , only the index assignment is different . whereas in the original graph we have @xmath338 , the index assignment for propagators in the dual graph is @xmath339 the conservation rule @xmath340 in ( [ ig ] ) now states that the difference between outgoing and incoming indices of the half - propagator attached to a dual vertex , namely @xmath341 , is conserved as minus the corresponding difference @xmath342 at the other end of the propagator .",
    "actually , these index differences describe the _ angular momentum _ , and the conservation of these differences @xmath343 and @xmath344 is nothing but the angular momentum conservation due to the @xmath345 symmetry of the noncommutative @xmath0-action .",
    "thus , taking the incoming indices as the reference , the angular momentum through the dual propagator determines the outgoing indices : @xmath346 in the same way , there are external angular momenta @xmath347 which enter the dual graph through the external valences .",
    "we shall also use the incoming arrow as the reference so that the angular momentum is the index difference between outgoing and incoming arrows .",
    "furthermore , by cyclicity at any vertex , the sum of all incoming differences at a vertex , i.e.  the sum of incoming angular momenta , must be zero .",
    "of course , this implies that the total external angular momentum entering a graph is zero , too .",
    "thus , the angular momentum for the dual graph is exactly like the usual momentum in an ordinary feynman graph : a momentum that goes out like @xmath38 at one half - end , must go out as @xmath348 at the other half - end , and the total momentum is conserved at any vertex .",
    "( in feynman graphs this follows from translation invariance . )",
    "it should be stressed that one has to take into account positivity constraints for the angular momenta @xmath349 : they lie in @xmath350 , but all indices @xmath351 must be _ positive _ integers .",
    "we therefore know that the number of _ independent _ index differences is exactly the number of _ loops _",
    "@xmath352 of the dual graph . for a connected graph ,",
    "this number is @xmath353 .",
    "furthermore , each index at a vertex is clearly only a function of the differences at a vertex and of a single _ reference index _ for the dual vertex .",
    "if the dual vertex is an external one , we take as the reference index the _ outgoing _ index at one of the external legs .",
    "if the dual vertex is an internal one , we have to make a choice ( determined later ) for the reference index .",
    "these internal vertex reference indices correspond to the loop variable of the original graph .",
    "therefore , after using the conservation rules or @xmath306-functions of each propagator , the number of independent indices to be summed for every graph is simply @xmath354 . here , @xmath355 is the number of boundary components of the original graph , which coincides with the number of external vertices of the dual graph .",
    "expressing each index in the graph as a function of a set @xmath320 of such independent indices is therefore identical to the problem called momentum routing in a feynman graph .",
    "it is well - known that the solution is not canonical or unique . a good way to root",

    "such a tree optimization for a given scale attribution is one of the most basic tools of constructive field theory @xcite , so it is an encouraging sign that it appears also here in a natural way .    in the graphical representations we distinguish the tree by triple dashed lines .      for the previously constructed tree",

    "we relabel the vertices in the tree such that all vertices in the subtree above a vertex @xmath392 have a label bigger than @xmath282 .    the order ( [ order ] ) of the lines of the graph provides us with a convenient position for the main reference index @xmath49 at each vertex .",
    "if @xmath393 is an internal vertex , we let @xmath394 be the smallest line in ( [ order ] ) which is attached to @xmath393 . by construction of the tree we know that either @xmath394 is a tadpole , or it belongs to the tree .",
    "we choose the _ outgoing _ index ( without the arrow when viewed from the vertex ) of this particular line @xmath394 as the main reference index @xmath395 .",
    "we let @xmath396 be the set of lines at which a main reference index resides .",

    "the rule goes as follows .",
    "one writes first the indices for all the `` leaves '' of the tree , that is the vertices ( distinct from the root ) with coordination 1 in the tree ( i.e.  vertices @xmath405 and @xmath406 in ( [ mainindices ] ) ) . for them , starting from the main index @xmath395 ( at the left of the unique line of @xmath356 at @xmath393 that goes towards the root , unless a tadpole at @xmath393 has the smallest scale ) , which agrees with the incoming index of the next line at @xmath393 in clockwise direction , we compute all other indices by turning _ clockwise _ around the vertex and by adding the angular momenta ( internal or external ones ) associated according to ( [ angmom ] ) with the loop lines @xmath407 and possibly external lines @xmath408 .",
    "this gives indices @xmath409 , @xmath410 ,  until we arrive at @xmath411 which is at the right of the unique line at @xmath393 that goes towards the root .",
    "some of the @xmath412 could be external angular momenta .",

    "the following picture shows these assignments for a particular `` leaf '' : @xmath414 having done this for all leaves , we can prune these leaves and consider the next layer of vertices down towards the root ( i.e.vertices @xmath415 and @xmath416 in ( [ mainindices ] ) ) and reiterate the argument .",
    "any summation index at a vertex @xmath393 is now clearly equal to @xmath395 plus a linear combination of angular momenta @xmath402 for the set of lines @xmath417 hooked to the `` subtree above @xmath393 '' , that is the lines hooked at least at one end to a vertex @xmath398 such that the unique path from @xmath398 to @xmath391 passes through @xmath393 .",
    "we split therefore the set @xmath320 of independent indices to be summed into the two sets :    * the set @xmath418 of main reference indices at inner vertices , which consists of @xmath399 elements , * the set @xmath419 of angular momenta , which consists of @xmath352 elements .",
    "the amplitude of the graph @xmath298 is now written as : @xmath420 where the sum over @xmath421 is over positive integers , but the sum over @xmath422 is over relative integers and the function @xmath423 is the characteristic function which states that all the functions @xmath424 are positive .",

    "the corresponding propagator would be @xmath434 see ( [ dual - assign ] ) .",
    "note that the incoming index viewed from @xmath398 is always the reference index , labelled @xmath435 in this case , and the corresponding outgoing index is obtained by adding the opposite angular momentum @xmath436 .",

    "@xmath451 when turning _ clockwise _ around the leaf ( starting from the main reference index ) are kept constant .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that the same rule also holds for tadpoles .",

    "altogether , the @xmath422-summation in ( [ ag ] ) can be estimated by @xmath473 where @xmath474 is the main reference index at @xmath475 .",
    "after summation over @xmath476 we have @xmath477    the dangerous region of the sum over the scale attribution is at large scale indices . to identify this region ,",
    "we associate to the order ( [ order ] ) of lines a sequence of subgraphs @xmath478 of the original ribbon graph by defining @xmath479 as the possibly disconnected set of lines @xmath480 , together with all vertices attached to them .",
    "to @xmath479 we associate the scale attribution @xmath481 which starts from an irrelevant low - scale cut - off @xmath482 .",
    "we conclude from ( [ ag-2 ] ) that the amplitude @xmath483 corresponding to the subgraph @xmath479 diverges if @xmath484 is non - negative , where @xmath485 , @xmath486 , @xmath487 , @xmath488 and @xmath489 are the numbers of external legs , vertices , edges , faces and external faces of @xmath479 , respectively , and @xmath490 is its genus .",
    "we have thus proven the following    [ pc - slice ] the sum over the scale attribution @xmath312 in ( [ ag-2 ] ) converges if for all subgraphs @xmath491 we have @xmath492 .    for the total graph @xmath493 the power - counting degree becomes @xmath494 , which reproduces the power - counting degree derived in @xcite .",
    "we consider in appendix  [ app : examples ] a few examples for the sum over the scale attribution .",
    "the power - counting theorem [ pc - slice ] implies that planar subgraphs with two or four external legs are the only ones for which the sum over the scale attribution can be divergent .",
    "these graphs require a separate analysis .",
    "we first see from theorem  [ thm - th2 ] that    * only those planar four - leg subgraphs with _ constant index _ along the trajectory are marginal , * only those planar two - leg graphs with _ constant index _ along the trajectory are relevant , * only those planar two - leg graphs with an _ accumulated index jump of 2 _ along the trajectory are marginal .    for the other types of graphs",
    "there is a sufficient power of @xmath495 through the terms @xmath496 in ( [ lowindex ] ) which makes the sum over the scale attribution convergent .    for the remaining truly divergent graphs one performs similarly as in the bphz scheme a taylor subtraction about vanishing external indices .",
    "for instance , a marginal four - leg graph with amplitude @xmath497 is written as @xmath498 the difference of graphs @xmath499 can be expressed as a linear combination involving the _ composite propagators _ ( [ comp-0 ] ) .",

    "these are normalized to their `` experimentally '' determined values : the physical coupling constant , the physical mass , the physical field amplitude and the physical frequency of the harmonic oscillator potential , respectively .    at the end",
    ", any graph appearing in the noncommutative @xmath0-model has an amplitude which is uniquely expressed by four normalization conditions as well as convergent sums over the scale attribution .",
    "thus , the model is renormalizable to all orders .",
    "for many years , noncommutative quantum field theories were supposed to be ill - behaved due to the uv / ir - mixing problem @xcite . meanwhile , it turned out @xcite that at least the euclidean noncommutative @xmath7-model is as good as its commutative version : it is renormalizable to all orders .",
    "in fact , the noncommutative @xmath7-model is even better than the commutative version with respect to one important issue : the behavior of the @xmath13-function .",
    "it is well - known that the main obstacle to a rigorous construction of the commutative @xmath7-model is the non - asymptotic freedom of the theory .",
    "the noncommutative model is very different : the computation of the @xmath13-function @xcite shows that the ratio of the bare coupling constant to the square of the bare frequency parameter remains ( at the one loop level ) constant over all scales , @xmath504 .",

    "eventually , we have established analytical bounds for the asymptotic behavior of the propagator which before were only established numerically .",
    "our proofs do not apply to the case @xmath506 , because the scale parameter becomes @xmath507 , see ( [ m-1 ] ) and ( [ rbeta ] ) .",
    "however , the case @xmath506 can be directly treated . according to ( [ eq : propinit - b ] ) , only the terms with @xmath508",
    "survive : @xmath509 the exponential decay of the propagator in any index is easily obtained from ( [ propfin ] ) for all slices . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath50-sum is trivial to perform due to the index conservation @xmath510 at each trajectory .",
    "we consider a few examples which underline the relation between ( [ ag-2 ] ) and divergent subgraphs .",

    "we put @xmath517 , @xmath518 : @xmath519 one can check that any order of scales @xmath520 leads to a convergent sum .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath521 the tree in the dual graph corresponds to @xmath512 and @xmath522 and @xmath514 . for the particular choice @xmath523 of the scale attribution",
