    "in communication networks and computing systems , resource allocation ( in some contexts also referred to as resource scheduling , pooling , or sharing ) is a phase , in a network protocol or system management stack , when a group of individual users or clients have to receive a portion of the resource in order to operate a service .",
    "resource allocation becomes a challenging problem when the available resource is limited and not enough to fully satisfy users demand .",
    "in such situations , resource allocation algorithms need to ensure a form of fairness .",
    "such situations emerge in a variety of contexts , such as wireless access  @xcite , competitive routing  @xcite , transport control  @xcite .",
    "the common methodology adopted in the literature is to , on the one hand , determine allocation rules such that they satisfy desirable properties  @xcite , and , on the other hand , analyse the fairness of a given allocation through indices , the most commonly used being the jain s index   @xcite . allocation rules and indices of fairness are commonly justified by some fairness criteria .",
    "for instance , among two equivalent users demanding the same amount of resource , it makes sense not to discriminate and to give to each of them the same portion of the resource . in some cases",
    ", it can be desirable to guarantee at least a minimum amount of the resource so that the maximum number of users can be served .    in the networking literature ,",
    "the resource allocation problem is historically solved as a single - decision maker problem in which users are possibly not aware of the other users demands and of the total amount of available resource .",
    "it follows that the most natural and intuitive way to quantify the user satisfaction is through the proportion of the demand that is satisfied by an allocation .",
    "large literature exists indeed in the networking area on proportional resource allocations for many practical situations , from wireless networks to transport connection management  @xcite .    in this paper , we are particularly interested instead in cooperative networking contexts such that users can be aware of other users demands and the available amount . as such , rational users shall compute their satisfaction also based on the presence of other users .",
    "in fact , such networking contexts with demand and resource availability awareness are making surface in wired and wireless network environments with an increasing level of programmability , i.e. , using software - defined radio and network platforms that expose novel ( northbound ) interfaces to users to disseminate information and pilot network resource allocations .",
    "our main idea is defining a new notion of user satisfaction for such interactive resource allocation situations with demand and resource awareness .",
    "[ es ]    let us briefly clarify our motivation with the following allocation example .",
    "a user @xmath0 asks a quantity of resource that is bigger than the resource itself ( as b in fig .",
    "classical fairness indices  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite tend to qualify the user satisfaction as maximum when @xmath0 obtains exactly what it asks . in the case where @xmath0 asks more than the available amount",
    ", it can not reach the maximum satisfaction due to the fact that its demand exceeds the available resource . instead , in demand and resource awareness conditions , it would be more reasonable that its satisfaction is maximum when it obtains all the available resource .",
    "furthermore , if all the other users together ask a quantity of good inferior to the resource , a minimum portion of it , equal to the difference between the resource and the sum of the demands of all the others , is guaranteed to @xmath0 . under a dual reasoning",
    ", it also appears more acceptable that the minimum satisfaction of a user is reached when it receives the minimum portion of the available resource , instead of when it receives zero .",
    "if users are in complete information context the classical approach can lead to not reasonable outcomes .    in this perspective , in order to better describe the user satisfaction as a function of the available resource , and to capture the interactions due to the networking context ( e.g. , networked users may be aware of respective demands , may ally in the formulation of their demands , etc ) , we propose to model the resource allocation problem as a coalitional game .",
    "accordingly , we define a new satisfaction rate for users , able to adapt to various configurations of the demands . furthermore , we define a new resource allocation rule , called the mood value , based on the idea that the most fair allocation is the one that equalizes the satisfaction of each player .",
    "indeed , regardless of the level of satisfaction , each player is not discriminated if its satisfaction is the same than the one of all the others .",
    "we also provide an interpretation of this approach positioning it with respect to classical traffic theory  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ background ] presents the state of the art on the topic . in section  [ satisf ] a new satisfaction rate",
    "is proposed . in section  [ moodvalue ] the mood value and a new fairness index are described . in section  [ traffictheory ]",
    "we provide an interpretation of the mood value with a traffic theory methodology .",
    "section  [ results ] presents some numerical examples .",
    "finally , section  [ concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "a resource allocation problem can be characterized by a pair @xmath1 , in which @xmath2 is the vector of demands ( claims ) from @xmath3 users ( claimants ) and @xmath4 is the resource ( estate ) that should be shared between them .",
    "the set of users is @xmath5 .",
    "the resource allocation is a challenging problem when @xmath4 is not enough to satisfy all the demands ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "an allocation @xmath7 is a solution vector that satisfies three basic properties :    * _ non - negativity _ :",
    "each user should receive at least zero . * _ demands boundedness _ :",
    "each user can not receive more than its demand . * _",
    "efficiency _ : the sum of all allocations should be @xmath4 .    an allocation rule is a function that associates a unique allocation vector @xmath8 to each @xmath9 .",
    "many resource allocation rules are proposed in the literature and each of them is characterized by a set of properties that justify the use of the given rule in order to find a solution of the allocation problem  @xcite . in computer networks , the most well - known rules are : the proportional rule and the weighted proportional rule  @xcite , the max - min fair allocation ( mmf )  @xcite ,  @xcite , and the @xmath10-fair allocation  @xcite .",
    "each of these allocation rules , result of an optimization problem and/or an iterative algorithm , follows a fairness criterion .",
    "the _ weighted proportional allocation rule _ is based on the idea that a logarithmic utility function captures well the individual evaluation of the worth of the resource  @xcite .",
    "one way to compute it is via the maximization of @xmath11 subject to demand boundness and efficiency constraints .",
    "when @xmath12 is equal to @xmath13 the resulting allocation is called simply proportional and when @xmath12 is equal to @xmath14 we obtain the allocation that actually produces allocations proportional to the demands ; hence in the following , we refer to the latter rule as proportional  instead of the previous ( not weighted ) one .",
    "the idea behind the _ max - min fairness ( mmf ) allocation _ is to maximize firstly the minimum allocation ; secondly , the second lowest allocation , and so on  @xcite .",
    "this solution coincides with the only feasible allocation such that , if the allocation of some users is increased , the allocation of some other users with smaller or equal amount is decreased .    more generally , it is possible to obtain a family of allocation rules maximizing a parametric utility function . the _ @xmath10-fair utility _ function is defined as @xmath15 @xcite . if @xmath16 the solution of the optimization problem coincides with the weighted proportional allocation with @xmath12 equal to @xmath13 , if @xmath17 with the minimum delay potential allocation , that is the allocation obtained minimizing the total potential delay @xmath18 @xcite , and if @xmath19 with the max - min fair allocation .",
    "recently game theory has been applied to communication systems in order to model network interactions .",
    "for example , in @xcite a cooperative game model is proposed to select a fair allocation of the transmission rate in multiple access channels and in @xcite the authors studied , using coalitional game theory , the cooperation between rational users in wireless networks .    moreover , it is possible to analyze the allocation problem as a transferable utility ( tu ) game @xcite , which is defined as a pair @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the set of _ players _ and @xmath22 is the _",
    "characteristic function _ ,",
    "( by convention , @xmath23 ) .",
    "bankruptcy games  @xcite , in particular , deal with situations where the number of claimed resource exceeds that available .",
    "a _ bankruptcy game _ is a tu - game @xmath20 in which the value of the coalition is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the estate to be divided and @xmath26 is a vector of claims satisfying the condition @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the bankruptcy game is _ superadditive _ , that is : @xmath28 it is also _ supermodular _ ( or , equivalently , _ convex _ ) , that is : @xmath29    a classical set - value solution for a tu - game is the _ core _",

    "given a bankruptcy game , many other solutions can be proposed @xcite . as already introduced in the previous section , the _ proportional allocation _ assigns to player @xmath0 an allocation equal to @xmath55 .",
    "for example , it is worth mentioning the _ constrained equal loss _ ( cel ) allocation that divides equally the difference between the sum of the demands and @xmath4 , under the constraint that no player receives a negative amount .",
    "the evaluation of the fairness of the allocations , used as an important system performance metric especially in networking , can be useful to discriminate among allocation rules and to evaluate the level of justice  in the repartition of the resources .",
    "jain  @xcite introduces a formula aimed at providing a quantitative measure of the fairness of a resource sharing allocation .",

    "the maximum fairness is measured when all the users obtain the same fraction of demand and the minimum fairness is measured when it exists only one user that receives all the resource .",
    "the jain s index has the following good properties :    * _ population size independence _ : applicable to any user set , finite or infinite . *",
    "_ scale and metric independence _ : not affected by the scale .",
    "* _ boundedness _ : can be expressed as a percentage . *",
    "_ continuity _ : able to capture any change in the allocation .",
    "the index considers the proportion of demand and it gives the maximum fairness to the allocation for which all the users receive the same proportion of the demand , regardless of the type of allocation problem , it suggests to allocate the resources in a proportional way even when this allocation is not the most suitable to solve the problem .",
    "another well - know index of fairness is the atkinson s index @xcite ; contrary to the jain s index , it measures the degree of inequality of a given allocation , taking value equal to 0 when the system is @xmath60 fair in the mmf sense , and 1 when it is totally unfair .",

    ", we consider only the jain s index because it is the one classically used in networking applications .",
    "mmf - driven inequality indices find their most appropriate use in socio - economical contexts , because they are linked to the concept of welfare of an income distribution .",
    "furthermore the jain s index is based on the idea of summarizing the information about the users satisfaction , which is close to our methodology of redefining users satisfaction under demand and resource awareness , as discussed in the following section .",
    "in this section , we propose a game - theoretic approach to evaluate the satisfaction of a user for an allocation .",
    "a crucial issue in resource allocation is to jointly :    * find the best solution in terms of a certain goal ; * evaluate its fairness by referring to a fairness index .    with this purpose ,",
    "it is important to evaluate the individual satisfaction rates and to summarize the information given by each of them with a global fairness index .    a natural way to quantify",
    "the satisfaction of a user , as proposed by jain , is through the proportion of the demand that is satisfied by an allocation @xcite .    given the user @xmath0 with demand @xmath14 and an allocation @xmath64 , the _ demand fraction satisfaction ( dfs ) rate _ of @xmath0 is : @xmath65    this rate takes value between 0 and 1 since it represents the percentage of the demand that is satisfied .",
    "unavoidably , this way to quantify the user satisfaction makes the weighted proportional allocation the fairest one since it allocates proportionally to the demand .",
    "there are , however , situations in which the common sense does not suggest to allocate in a proportional way ; e.g. , if there is a big gap between the demands , in order to protect the weaker  users and guarantee them a minimum portion of the estate , the mmf allocation can be preferable . furthermore , as mentioned in the introduction , the presence of other users should rationally be considered not to distort the satisfaction of each user , in case of awareness about other users demand and the available demands .    for these reasons , we aim at defining an alternative satisfaction rate such that it satisfies the following two properties we name demand relativeness and relative null satisfaction :    * _ demand relativeness _ :",
    "a user is fully satisfied when it receives its maximal right , based on the available resource ; * _ relative null satisfaction _ : a user has null satisfaction when it receives exactly its minimal right , based on other users demands and the available resource .",
    "the minimal right for a player is the difference between the available amount and the sum of the demands of the other users ( i.e. , taking a worst case assumption that the others get the totality of their demand ) , and the maximal right is equal to the maximum available resource , i.e. , @xmath14 if @xmath66 , or it is equal to e otherwise . remembering the definition of the characteristic function of a bankruptcy game we have that :    * the _ minimal right _ for player @xmath0 is @xmath67 * the _ maximal right _ for player @xmath0 is @xmath68    thus we introduce the player satisfaction ( ps ) rate , which satisfies the above two properties by considering the value of the bankruptcy game associated to the allocation problem .    given a bankruptcy game such that @xmath69 and an allocation @xmath64 , the _ player satisfaction ( ps ) rate _ for @xmath0 is : @xmath70 where : @xmath71 , @xmath72 . if @xmath73 the player satisfaction rate is @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",

    "moreover it corrects  @xmath77 since it replaces the interval of possible values @xmath78 $ ] for @xmath64 with the interval @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "consequently , if for the dfs rate the maximum satisfaction for @xmath0 is measured when it gets @xmath14 and the minimum when it gets 0 , with ps , @xmath0 is measured to be totally satisfied when it gets @xmath80 and totally unsatisfied when it gets @xmath81 .",
    "consider @xmath61 of example 1 ( see fig.[es ] ) and the corresponding bankruptcy game model .",
    "it holds : + proportional allocation : @xmath82 and @xmath83 + mmf allocation : @xmath84 and @xmath85 . + in both cases the ps rate shows that player 2 is less satisfied than what expected with the dfs rate .",
    "this is due to the fact that the game guarantees player 2 to get at least 5 .",

    "a typical application is the bandwidth sharing between elastic applications  @xcite , i.e. , protocols able to adapt the transmission rate upon detection of packet loss . in this context",
    "we show how it is possible to revisit the mood value as a value resulting of the sum of the minimum allocation and the result of a weighted proportional allocation formulation where the weights are not the original demands , but new demands re - scaled accordingly to the maximum possible allocation knowing the available resource , and the minimum allocation under the awareness of other user s demands and the available resource .",

    "the algorithm shows that the mood value firstly assign the minimal right ( step 1 ) and secondly , considering the new allocation problem resulting after the first assignment ( step 2 ) , it allocates in a proportional way the resources ( step 3 ) .",
    "the proportion of resource to allocated is the mood .",
    "we provides two ways to compute the mood value : ( [ xm ] ) and the 4-step algorithm of section  [ traffictheory ] .",
    "it is clear that the computation of the mood value throught the formula ( [ xm ] ) is less complex than the one using the 4 steps algorithm .",
    "we tested the mood value and the new fairness index in a few significant configurations comparing them with the classical allocations and the jain s index .",
    "we considered two demands distributions : ( i ) a uniform distribution , and ( ii ) a weibull distribution .",
    "the former can be considered as a baseline , while the latter a maybe more realistic one . to create the weibull distribution , taking inspiration from cellular ( ofdma ) resource allocation studies we emulated an indoor scenario of femtocells using the winner ii channel model  @xcite : generating in a uniform way 10000 users around the cell station between 3 and 100 m , we associate resource blocks ( rbs ) to each of them with a transmit power between 1 and 100 db ; fig . [ scenario ]",
    "is the resulting rb histogram distribution , which is well fit by a weibull distribution @xmath234 for @xmath235 with scale parameter @xmath236 and shape parameter @xmath237 .",
    "the range for demand generation is between 0 and 6000 units .",
    "it is worth noting that the weibull distribution is quite close to the pareto distribution ( both are exponential ones ) , its and discrete variations ( e.g. , zipf s one ) , for example used in in - network content caching resource allocation  @xcite .",
    "[ scenario 2 ]    [ scenario ]    [ scenari ]    [ fig_simrand ]    we run different instances with a ratio of @xmath238 ( available resource ) ranging from @xmath239 to @xmath240 of the global demand .",
    "we first simulate 300 bankruptcy games with 3 and 5 users .",
    "[ scenari ] show the users configuration as a function of the available resource . with 3 users ( fig .",
    "[ scenari]a , c ) , for low value of @xmath109 almost all are greedy players ( gg case ) due to the fact that the resource is small ; increasing @xmath4 the number of moderate players ( gm ) increases but also some users in configuration mg appear .",
    "in fact , increasing @xmath238 some greedy players become moderate while the others remain greedy ones ; some of them are greedy inside a group of greedy users ( gg ) , while some others greedy inside a group of moderate ones ( mg ) .",
    "when the available resource is higher than half of the global demand , greedy players gg disappear and the number of moderate players increases . in particular , users mm appear and they become the majority when the resource is large . with 5 users ( fig .  [",
    "scenari]b , d ) , we find a similar trend than with 3 users in the number of moderate players that increases when increasing @xmath109 .",
    "however , mg users are few ; in fact , it holds that it can exist at most one mg user in a game and , due to the higher number of users in the system , it is very unlikely that there exists only a player mg in the system such that the sum of the demands of the other @xmath110 players exceeds @xmath241 .",
    "thus , with a number of users higher than 5 , one can practically reduce the number of user cases from 4 to 3 .",
    "for this reason , in order to capture all the possible scenarios , we choose a low number of user for the first round of simulations .",
    "[ fig_simrand ] ,  [ fig_sim1 ] and  [ fig_sim2 ] show the results of the first simulations .",
    "we consider the six allocations discussed before : proportional , shapley , nucleolus , mood value , mmf and cel .",
    "we calculate the jain s fairness index and the players fairness index and we plot , for each ratio of @xmath4 and each index , the mean value in between the first and third quantile lines .",
    "the jain s index is depicted with the red color and square points while the players fairness index with the blue one and round points .",
    "due to space limit , we do not show the case of 3 users with uniform demand distribution because similar to the 3-user one with the weibull distribution .",
    "[ fig_sim1 ]    [ fig_sim2 ]    in the 3-user scenario ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sim1 ] ) it is possible to notice differences between the result obtained by the classical jain s index and our new players fairness ( pf ) index .",
    "it is worth recalling that the jain s index has value 1 when the allocation is proportional while the pf index is 1 when the allocation is the mood value .",
    "we can notice that the pf index considers the mmf allocation as a fair one when the available resource is small ( high congestion ) , i.e. , when there are many greedy users .",
    "in fact the mmf allocation and the mood value , are close : in such cases , both have the property of treating equally the greedy claimant , giving them the same portion of resource , independently of their demands .",
    "instead , when @xmath4 increases , the mmf one is not fair any longer because it satisfies more the two users with less claim while it gives the minimal right to the one with bigger claim ; in fact , in such cases the mood value becomes closer to the proportional allocation , to the shapley value and to the nucleolus .",
    "the similarity between the proportional allocation and the mood value is due to the fact that the correct way to measure the satisfaction of moderate players is through the dfs rate and increasing @xmath238 the number of moderate players increases .",
    "it follows that the allocation equalizing the dfs rates , i.e. , the proportional one , is close to the one equalizing the ps rates of user , i.e. , the mood value .    with 5 users ( fig .",
    "[ fig_simrand ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_sim2 ] ) , we can notice that , due to the fact that the group mg is little , when @xmath109 reach the @xmath242 of the global demand the proportional is equal to the mood value and it shows a pf index equal to 1 .",
    "furthermore the mmf allocation show again a high ( pf ) fairness when the resource is little ( @xmath239 ) , i.e. , when there are many greedy players .    [ rateslow ]    with a second round of simulations we want to see how the demand fraction ( dfs ) and player ( ps ) satisfaction rates are distributed with an increasing number of users .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ rateslow ] as box - plots ( minimum , quantiles and maximum , without outliers ) , for two regimes ( high congestion of a 5% @xmath4/demand ratio , and low congestion of a 95% ratio ) .",
    "we can notice that the value of the satisfaction is low when the resource is small ( fig ..  [ rateslow]a , b , c ) while it is higher when the congestion is low ( fig .",
    "[ rateslow]d , e , f ) . with 4 users , in terms of user satisfaction rate ,",
    "the mood value is close to the mmf allocation when the congestion is high , and to the proportional allocation when the congestion is low . as the number of players grows , the absolute difference between allocation in terms of distribution of the satisfaction decrease .",
    "in both the congestion situations ( @xmath4 equal to 5% and 95% of the demand ) the shapley value is the closest allocation to the mood value in terms of ps rate .    summarizing ,",
    "the simulations show that the mood value is able to nicely weight the nature ( greedy or moderate ) of users and of user groups .",
    "in particular it is close to the mmf allocation when the resource is scarce and to the proportional allocation when the resource is close to the global demand .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noticing that with respect to classical game - theoretical allocation rules ( shapley value , nucleolus ) , the results show that the mood value shows a similar good behavior in terms of fairness , with the key advantage of having a much lower computation time complexity .",
    "we proposed a game - theoretical approach to analyze and solve resource allocation problems , going beyond classical approaches that do not explore the setting where users can be aware of other users demand and the available resource .",
    "in particular , we proposed a new way of quantifying the user satisfaction and a new fairness index as enhancement of the jain s index , describing and comparing their mathematical properties in detail . accordingly to these new concepts , we propose a new resource allocation rule that meets the goal of providing the fairest resource allocation , we called the mood value , which we position with respect to game theory metrics as well the common theory of fair allocation in networks .    finally , we test our ideas via numerical simulations of representative demand distributions , showing at which extent the mood value can approach and differ from max - min - fairness , weighted proportional , constrained - equal loss , shapley value and nucleolus allocations .",
