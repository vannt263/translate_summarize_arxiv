    "measuring purely leptonic decays of heavy mesons allows the determination of meson decay constants , which connect measured quantities , such as the @xmath5 mixing ratio , to ckm matrix elements .",
    "currently , it is not possible to determine @xmath6 experimentally from leptonic @xmath7 decays , so theoretical calculations of @xmath6 must be used .",
    "the most promising of these calculations involves lattice qcd @xcite @xcite @xcite , though there are other methods @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "measurements of pseudoscalar decay constants such as @xmath8 provide checks on these calculations and help discriminate among different models .",
    "= 3.0 in    the decay diagram for @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ dptomunu ] .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 mass , @xmath13 is the mass of the final state lepton , @xmath14 is a ckm matrix element equal to 0.2205 @xcite , and @xmath15 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "various theoretical predictions of @xmath8 range from 190 mev to 350 mev . because of helicity suppression",
    ", the electron mode @xmath16 has a very small rate . the relative widths are @xmath17 for the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 final states , respectively .",
    "unfortunately the mode with the largest branching fraction , @xmath21 , has at least two neutrinos in the final state and is difficult to detect .",
    "the cleo - c detector is equipped to measure the momenta and direction of charged particles , identify charged hadrons , detect photons and measure with good precision their directions and energies .",
    "muons above 1.1 gev can also be identified .",
    "the detector is almost cylindrically symmetric with everything but the muon detector inside a superconducting magnet coil run at a current that produces an almost uniform 1.0 t field .",
    "the detector consists of a six - layer wire drift chamber at small radius that is low mass , suitable for these relatively low energies .",
    "it is followed by a 47-layer drift chamber ; both chambers use a gas mixture of 60% helium and 40% propane . these two devices measure charged track three - momenta with excellent accuracy .",
    "the drift chamber also measures energy loss , de / dx , that is used to identify charged tracks below about 0.7 gev / c .",
    "after the drift chamber there is a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) @xcite , that identifies charged particles over most of their momentum range .",
    "the rich is surrounded by a thallium doped csi crystal array consisting of about 8000 tapered crystals 30 cm long and about 5x5 @xmath22 at the rear .",
    "in this study we use 60 pb@xmath0 of cleo - c data recorded at the @xmath23 resonance ( 3.770 gev ) .",
    "these events consist of a mixture of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and continuum events .",
    "there also may be small amounts of @xmath26 pairs and two - photon events .",
    "we examine all the recorded events and retain those containing at least one charged @xmath27 candidate in the modes listed in table  [ tab : drecon ] .",
    "the selection criteria are described in detail in what follows .",
    "all acceptable track candidates must have a helical trajectory that approaches the event origin within a distance of 0.005 m in the azimuthal projection and 0.05 m in the polar projection , where the azimuthal projection is in the bend view of the solenoidal magnet .",
    "each track must posses at least 50% of the hits expected to be on a track and its polar direction must have cosine with respect to the beam direction of magnitude @xmath28 .",
    "we use both charged particle ionization loss in the drift chamber ( de / dx ) and rich information to identify kaons and pions used to fully reconstruct @xmath27 mesons .",
    "the rich is used for momenta larger than 0.55 gev .",
    "information on the angle of detected cherenkov photons is translated into a liklihood of a given photon being due to a particular particle .",
    "contributions from all photons associated with a particular track are then summed to form an overall liklihood denoted as @xmath29 for each particle hypothesis . to differentiate between pion and kaon candidates , we use the difference : @xmath30 ) .",
    "usually this cut is set at zero except for muon candidates where the difference between @xmath31 ) is set at 10 , to ensure a high , well understood efficiency . to utilize the de / dx information",
    "we calculate @xmath32 as the difference between the expected ionization loss for a pion and the measured loss divided by the measurement error .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 is defined in the same manner using the expected ionization for a kaon .",
    "we use both the rich and de / dx information for @xmath34 meson tag candidate tracks in the following manner : ( a ) if neither the rich nor de / dx information is available , then the track is accepted as both a pion and a kaon candidate .",
    "( b ) if de / dx is available and rich is not then we insist that pion candidates have @xmath35 and kaon candidates have @xmath36 ( c ) if rich information is available and de / dx is not available , then we require that @xmath37 for pions and @xmath38 for kaons .",
    "( d ) if both de / dx and rich information are available , we require that @xmath39 for pions and @xmath40 for kaons .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath41 s by first selecting photon candidates from energy deposits in the crystals not matched to charged tracks that have deposition patterns consistent with that expected for photons .",
    "pairs of photon candidates are kinematically fit to the nominal @xmath41 mass .",
    "we require the pull , the difference between the raw and fit mass normalized by its uncertainty , to be less than three for accepted @xmath41 candidates .",
    "@xmath42 are formed from a pair of charged pions which are kinematically fitted to come from a single vertex .",
    "we also require that the invariant mass of the two pions be within 4.5 times the width of the @xmath43 mass peak which is 0.004 gev r.m.s .",
    "tagging modes are fully reconstructed by first evaluating the difference in the energy of the decay products with the beam energy .",
    "we then normally require the absolute value of this difference to be within 0.02 gev of zero , approximately twice the r.m.s .",
    "width , and then look at the reconstructed @xmath34 beam constrained mass defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 runs over all the final state particles .",
    "we also use the charge - conjugate @xmath12 tags and search for @xmath47 ; in the rest of this paper we will not mention the charge - conjugate modes explicitly , but they are always used .    the @xmath48 distribution for all @xmath34 tagging modes considered in this data sample are shown in fig .  [ drecon ] and listed in table  [ tab : drecon ] along with the number of signal and background events .",
    "the event numbers are determined from fits of the @xmath48 distributions to gaussian signal functions plus a background shape parameterized as @xmath49 order polynomial for the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and from fits to double gaussian signal functions plus @xmath49 order polynomial for @xmath53 and @xmath54 tags where we see a small tail on the higher mass side .",
    "the models generally predict @xmath55 to be 10 - 15% larger than @xmath8 .",
    "cleo previously measured @xmath55 as ( @xmath56 mev @xcite , and we are consistent with these predictions as well .",
    "we look forward to more data to improve the precision .",
