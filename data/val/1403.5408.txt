    "time - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( trpes ) is a technique for characterizing the electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring after photoabsorption in molecules  @xcite .",
    "it allows one to map the occupied electronic states of a given interacting system and complements the information one can gather from optical spectroscopy .",
    "trpes is particularly suited to the study of ultrafast non - adiabatic processes because photoelectron spectroscopy is sensitive to both electronic configurations and dynamics .",
    "many open questions remain , linked to how composite electron- excitations or shake - up processes appear in time - resolved spectroscopies  @xcite .",
    "much work has been done in solid state physics concerning phonon side - bands in photoelectron spectra  @xcite , and in molecular systems using both standard optical spectroscopies and time resolved transient absorption spectroscopy  @xcite . with the advent of attosecond laser pulse technology  @xcite , its increased temporal resolution has allowed the direct observation and control of coherent electronic motion  @xcite .    in trpes experiments ,",
    "a time - delayed probe laser photo - ionizes an electron out to an evolving ( usually laser - generated ) excited state .",
    "the outgoing electron s kinetic energy and angular distribution is then measured as a function of time  @xcite .    the time - resolved photoelectron angular distribution ( trpad ) , is frequently available in gas phase experiments .",
    "however , it is rarely analysed , since it is so difficult to interpret .",
    "this is because the random orientation of molecules in free space significantly broadens the results , observe the ejection dynamics in the molecular frame .",
    "for this reason , molecular pre - alignment  @xcite and coincidence techniques  @xcite , have proven necessary to extract molecular properties from trpads . even in the molecular frame ,",
    "a quantitative analysis is a formidable task .",
    "this is due to factors such as the multi - electron nature of the system , the subtle coupling between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom , and nonlinearities due to the relatively high laser intensities required .    to complement these advanced experimental techniques , accurate and robust theoretical methodologies are necessary for their clear interpretation  @xcite",
    "however , the choice of which level of theory to use is often a difficult task .    on the one side , the direct solution of the full time - dependent schrdinger equation for interacting electrons should provide a full description .",
    "however , in the presence of time - dependent external fields , the full solution is feasible only for two electrons in three dimensions  @xcite . on the other side",
    ", the single active electron approximation  @xcite often invoked in many theoretical works , @xcite .",
    "the sampling - point method has been successfully used to study the pes of small clusters  @xcite . however",
    ", this method has suffered from numerical limitations in both angular resolution and total pulse length .",
    "the recently introduced mask - method  @xcite , provides both better performance and full momentum resolution .",
    "it is this method which we employ in the present paper .",
    "previously we demonstrated how tddft can be used to describe time - resolved spectroscopies @xcite . in principle , this allows one to handle large scale systems at a reasonable computational cost .",
    "however , we only considered the electronic degrees of freedom without analysing the impact of nuclear vibrations .    in the present work we extend the previous theoretical tddft framework by including classical molecular dynamics ( md ) through an ehrenfest approach  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the combined framework for the case study of ethylene already studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , we investigate the effect of the nuclear degrees of freedom on the time evolution of the electronic @xmath0 transition .",
    "within tddft all physical properties of a system can be determined by knowing their functional dependence with respect to the interacting many - body density  @xcite .",
    "the crucial idea of both dft and tddft , is to obtain this many - body density through a mapping from the density of a fictitious , auxiliary system of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the latter is the so - called kohn - sham ( ks ) system  @xcite .",
    "first , the ground state density is obtained by solving the ks equations self - consistently at the dft level .",
    "the evolution of the system then follows according to the time dependent kohn sham ( tdks ) equations ( in atomic units ) :    @xmath1(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right ) \\varphi_i(\\mathbf{r},t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 here we assume an even number of electrons @xmath4 , and a spin - restricted configuration in which all the ks spatial orbitals @xmath5 are doubly occupied .",

    "is given by : @xmath10 where are the set of classical positions and @xmath11 are their respective charges .",
    "the electronic density depends parametrically on the positions .",
    "the motion of the nuclei is in turn determined by the electronic density gradient through newton s equations of motion .",

    "we solve the coupled tdks plus classical nuclear motion equations in the presence of a mask boundary absorber of a given width @xmath20 .",
    "absorbed electrons are collected and evolved in momentum space as free volkov states @xmath21 within the ionization region @xmath19 .",
    "the boundary between @xmath16 and @xmath19 has to be placed at sufficiently large distances so that @xmath21 is composed of outgoing waves only .",
    "the momentum - resolved photoelectron probability is then @xmath22 observables such as pes @xmath23 or pad @xmath24 are obtained from @xmath25 by integration or slicing respectively .",
    "the exchange and correlation functional we use in this work is the well known local density approximation ( lda ) coupled with an average - density self interaction correction ( adsic )  @xcite for the ground state and its adiabatic extension for tddft .",
    "the choice of adsic is motivated by its correct asymptotic behaviour in the ground state .",
    "in other words , for a large distance @xmath26 from the molecule , @xmath27 .",
    "the high - lying unoccupied ks bound states close to the ionization threshold are thus described more accurately than with an exponentially decaying xc potential . for ethylene , using lda alone gives an unbound @xmath28 state .",
    "this makes the @xmath29 transition inaccesible with most standard xc - functionals . on the other hand ,",
    "the combination of lda and adsic has been successfully employed in conditions similar to the ones described in this work  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we freeze the @xmath30 electrons of the carbon cores into a pseudopotential generated within the troullier - martins scheme  @xcite as distributed in the octopus code . as these core levels are strongly bound ( @xmath3110.29 ha for carbon ) we expect that neither the pump nor the probe will ionize them .",
    "the tdks equations are discretized and solved using a finite differences method within the octopus code @xcite .",
    "we employ a spherical grid of radius @xmath32 with a grid spacing of @xmath33 .",
    "we introduce a @xmath34 wide mask boundary absorber to collect the photoelectrons and prevent electronic reflections  @xcite .",
    "a velocity verlet algorithm is employed to propagate newton s equations ( [ eq : classicalforces ] ) and an enforced time - reversal symmetry operator @xcite is used to time - step the tdks equations , with a time step of @xmath35 as .",
    "this is small enough to steadily propagate nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in all the presented calculations .",
    "the molecular geometry obtained by force minimization ( @xmath36  @xmath37 ) has the two carbon atoms placed on the @xmath38-axis at @xmath39 and hydrogens in the @xmath40-plane at @xmath41 .",
    "the carbon - carbon ( c  c ) bond - length of 2.337  @xmath42 is in fair agreement with the experimental one of 2.531  @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "[ fig_1:fig ]    moreover the first ionization potential obtained from lda+adsic is @xmath43  @xmath42 , in agreement with the experimental value of 0.386  @xmath42  @xcite . here , @xmath44 has been evaluated within dft using the vacuum energy minus that of the highest occupied ks orbital , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "the photoionization process we consider is depicted schematically in figure  [ fig_1:fig ] , where the laser parameters have been adapted from ref .",
    "a pump pulse resonantly populates the bound @xmath46 state and the build - up is monitored at different times with a delayed probe laser .",
    "this is accomplished by applying an ultraviolet ( uv ) pump that is tuned to excite from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) . for ethylene",
    ", this corresponds to a @xmath47 transition .",
    "in particular , we employ an uv pump laser of energy @xmath48  ha , with a 15 cycle trapezoidal shape ( 3 cycle ramp ) , and an intensity @xmath49  w/@xmath50 polarized along the @xmath38-axis .",
    "the probe is an xuv laser of energy @xmath51  ha , with a 40 cycle trapezoidal shape ( 8 cycle ramp ) , and an intensity of @xmath52  w/@xmath50 polarized along the @xmath53-axis .",
    "the time delay between the pump and the probe is measured from the onset of the pump to the center of the probe so that negative delays correspond to cases where the probe precedes the pump .",
    "moreover , we record photoelectrons only during the on - time of the probe pulse .",
    "when we calculate the spectra for classically moving , we introduce an initial temperature of 300  k under the same pump - probe conditions . in this way , we may assess the impact of the degrees of freedom on the trpes .",
    "the temperature is introduced in our model by assigning to each nucleus a random initial velocity consistent with a boltzmann distribution at that temperature .",
    "the trpes for ethylene with the frozen at their equilibrium positions is shown in figure  [ fig_2:fig ] ( a ) .",
    "the spectra presents similar features to those described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the peak at @xmath54  ha constitutes the main ionization channel and it is due to the pump alone . here ,",
    "the absorption of a pump photon leading to a @xmath47 transition , is followed by a second pump photon which directly excites electrons from the @xmath55 state into the continuum .",
    "multi - photon replicas of this peak can be observed at energies separated by integer multiples of @xmath56 .",
    "the peak at @xmath57  ha corresponds to the direct emission from the highest occupied ks orbital into the continuum .    a similar mechanism , but with electrons ejected from deeper levels , is responsible for the peaks lying at energies lower than @xmath58 .",
    "these peaks depend on molecular ground state properties and the probe laser only . for this reason",
    "they can be observed also for negative delays @xmath59 .    the population of the @xmath60 state increases with the delay for @xmath61 .",
    "at about the same @xmath62 for which @xmath63 becomes visible , the peak at @xmath64  ha begins to emerge .",
    "this peak corresponds to electrons ejected into the continuum from the @xmath65 state , which is transiently occupied via the pump pulse .",
    "[ fig_2:fig ]    to further analyse the results , in figure  [ fig_3:fig ] we plot a cut of the trpes at @xmath66  fs , after the pump has been switched off . in the figure",
    "we introduce new peak labels in addition to @xmath63 , @xmath58 , @xmath67 , which have been previously discussed .",
    "these labels identify the contribution to each peak from the ground state ks orbitals of ethylene shown in figure  [ fig_1:fig ] .",
    "[ fig_3:fig ]    the inset of figure  [ fig_3:fig ] shows how the frozen and moving pads correlate with the originating orbital symmetry .",
    "photoelectrons emerging with kinetic energy @xmath58 are ejected from almost degenerate @xmath68 and @xmath69 orbitals .",
    "the pads associated with @xmath58 coherently display a symmetry compatible with the superposition of these orbitals . on the other hand , the pads for @xmath67 present a nodal structure clearly linked to a @xmath28 orbital symmetry .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_2:fig](b ) , the effect of motion on the electronic trpes is negligible .",
    "further , the pad is minimally changed by the effect of moving the as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig_3:fig ] .        [ fig_4:fig ]    .",
    "as a result , the molecular geometry is minimally modified during the action of the pump pulse , with a maximum change in the c  c bond - length of less than 0.033  @xmath42 .",
    "for the laser parameters depicted in figure  [ fig_1:fig ] , the photoelectron properties of the molecule are largely unaffected by the coupling with degrees of freedom .",
    "[ fig_5:fig ]    a stronger response can be stimulated by propagating a fully occupied electronic excited state . in the previous case ,",
    "the pump laser was in charge of populating an excited state , which was subsequently observed during its construction , by means of a delayed probe pulse .",
    "we now investigate the effect of the coupling between and electronic degrees of freedom while keeping an excited state fully populated .    to this end , we artificially promote one electron from the highest occupied ks molecular orbital ( homo ) to the first unoccupied one ( lumo ) , and propagate keeping this configuration .",
    "the ks lumo with @xmath70 symmetry is of anti - bonding nature .",
    "we thus expect its occupation to have sizeable effects on the motion , especially on the c  c bond .",
    "we employ the same probe pulse shown in figure  [ fig_1:fig ] , while the pump pulse has been omitted . here , the time delay is measured as the difference from the center of the probe to the starting point of the time evolution .",
    "changes in the bond length and the torsion of the molecule induced by the initial electronic excitation are shown on the left and right hand side of figure  [ fig_4:fig ]  ( a ) , respectively . the same is shown in figure  [ fig_5:fig ] for a longer time propagation .",
    "the c  c bond length displays an oscillatory behaviour .",
    "it initially increases up to @xmath71  @xmath42 at @xmath72  fs over its initial ground state equilibrium position , and then oscillates in time .",
    "the molecule undergoes a twist along the c  c axis reaching a maximum torsion of @xmath73 .",
    "this behavior is at the core of cis - trans isomerization processes happening in many photochemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "the vibrational stretching frequency along the c  c bond ( @xmath74  ha ) and the torsional distortion        [ fig_6:fig ]    ( @xmath75  ha ) are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data ( @xmath76  ha and @xmath77  ha )  @xcite .    these modifications of the molecule s geometry are reflected in the trpes shown in figure  [ fig_4:fig ]  ( b ) . for time delays @xmath78 we have five initial peaks in the trpes , as we had in the pump - probe case ( see figures  [ fig_2:fig ] and  [ fig_3:fig ] ) .",
    "however , now the initial spectrum changes in time , as the peaks shift in position and new ones emerge close to the maximum elongation of the c  c bond .    the lowest energy peak oscillates in energy in phase with the c  c bond length .",
    "this peak is consistent with all - bonding @xmath79 orbital electrons ( see figure  [ fig_1:fig ] ) , and is therefore sensitive to the molecule s bond - length and relatively insensitive to its torsion angle .",
    "the following peak in energy splits into two new peaks .",
    "the peak that shifts in energy , corresponds to the @xmath80 state , whereas the one that does not , to the @xmath81 state .",
    "the @xmath80 state energy shift is due to the fact that it connects hydrogens bound to different carbon atoms , and is therefore sensitive to the molecule s torsion and the c  c bond length .",
    "the intermediate peak in energy corresponds to the @xmath82 state , which does not shift in energy , as it is only weakly affected by the molecule s bond stretching .    the second to last peak in energy corresponds to the @xmath83 and @xmath69 states .",
    "the former shifts towards lower energies because it does not connect hydrogens bound to different carbon atoms , and the latter depletes probability along the nodal plane , shifting towards higher energies .",
    "the highest and last peak in energy is consistent with the @xmath28 and it shifts towards lower energies because it builds probability along the nodal plane .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath69 orbitals become degenerate when a torsion angle of @xmath84 is reached .",
    "the lumo @xmath28 orbital evolution is shown on top of figure  [ fig_4:fig ] .    in order to support this analysis , in figure  [ fig_6:fig ]  ( c ) we present selected cuts of the trpes at the specific time delays @xmath85  fs , @xmath86  fs and @xmath87  fs . the time evolution of each photoelectron peak ,",
    "can here be monitored identifying each peak with its pad _ fingerprint _ in figures  [ fig_6:fig ]  ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the peaks labeled * f * , * g * , * h * , which shift towards lower energies as time evolves , belong to the same state according to the pads .",
    "this state can easily be associated to a @xmath28 orbital due to its nodal structure .",
    "similarly , the peaks * c * , * d * , * e * , which shift towards higher energies as time evolves , all originate from the same @xmath69 orbital .    in comparison to the homo @xmath58 pads we observed in the pump - probe case of figure  [ fig_3:fig ] , the @xmath69 character is here",
    "more defined .",
    "this is because the occupation of the ks lumo state is lifting the @xmath83 , @xmath69 degeneracy that we had previously .",
    "when the c  c elongation is at its maximum value at @xmath88 , a new peak emerges at @xmath89  ha , which disappears at @xmath90 .    in order to understand where this extra peak comes from",
    ", we have obtained the photoelectron spectrum of methylene with the same probe pulse used for ethylene as shown filled in figure  [ fig_6:fig ]  ( c ) . the pads and orbitals of the peaks labeled * b * ( belonging to ethylene ) and * a * ( belonging to methylene ) in figure  [ fig_6:fig ]  ( a ) display a @xmath80 symmetry .",
    "we can therefore conclude , that this extra peak is related to the @xmath80 ethylene state which becomes less stable as the c  c bond length increases .",
    "the first main peak corresponds to a @xmath79 state , which increases in energy until @xmath88 and then decreases again until @xmath90 as shown in the pes in figure  [ fig_6:fig ]  ( c ) .",
    "the second main peak shifts towards lower energies as time evolves .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath81 and @xmath80 states , which separate in energy at @xmath88 , as explained above .",
    "in this paper we investigated the impact of degrees of freedom in trpes and trpad for the test case of the ethylene molecule .",
    "we first studied the case where a pump laser resonantly excites a bound state which is subsequently probed by a time delayed pulse with attosecond time scale resolution .    in order to induce detectable effects we studied the time evolution of a molecular excited state created by artificially promoting one electron from the ks homo to the lumo .",
    "this has proven to be sufficient to excite vibrational c  c bond and torsional modes .",
    "trpes in this case has shown changes that can be understood in terms of pads and orbital deformations associated to rearrangements .",
