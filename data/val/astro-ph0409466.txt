    "there is mounting evidence that long duration @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are both produced by highly relativistic and narrowly collimated jets ejected in supernova ( sn ) explosions akin to sn1998bw ( see , e.g. dar 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "low - luminosity grbs and xrfs seem to be ordinary grbs whose @xmath0-rays are much softer and their luminosity is much lower because they are viewed from angles relative to the jet which are a few times larger than the viewing angles of ordinary grbs ( see , e.g. dar & de rjula 2000,2003 ; dado , dar & de rjula 2002,2004 and references therein ) .",
    "however , recently , the european space agency satellite integral discovered grb 031203 ( gtz et al .",
    "2004 ) at a redshift @xmath1 ( prochaska et al .",
    "2004 ) , the second nearest grb after grb 980425 at @xmath2 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , which like grb 980425 had extremely low lunminosity , but , contrary to the expectation , its @xmath0-rays were not much softer than those of ordinary grbs ( sazonov et al . 2004 ) .",
    "grb 031203 was produced in an sn very similar to sn1998bw which produced grb 980425 ( e.g. malesani et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , the integral observations were interpreted as evidence of a different class of grbs , which are intrinsically very faint and include grb 980425 and grb 031203 ( sazonov et al .  2004 ; soderberg et al .  2004 ; woosley et al .",
    "2004 ) and are produced in sne akin to sn1998bw .",
    "the spectrum of the soft @xmath0-rays emitted in grb 031203 , which was measured with integral , is well described by @xmath3 between 20 and 400 @xmath4 ( sazonov et al .",
    "but , its soft x - ray fluence in the 0.2 - 10 @xmath4 range , @xmath5 which was inferred ( watson et al .  2004 ) from its x - ray dust - scattered echo measured by xmm - newton ( vaughan et al .",
    "2004 ) , is far above the integral spectrum extrapolated to the soft x - ray region .",
    "it has been suggested that the soft x - ray fluence may have been overestimated ( prochaska et al .",
    "2004 ; sazonov et al .",
    "2004 ) .    however , in this letter we suggest an alternative interpretation of the integral and xmm - newton observations , which is based on the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs and xrfs ( e.g. dar & de rjula 2003 ; dado et al .",
    "2004 ) and which removes the conflicts between the off - axis interpretation of the unusually low luminosity of grb 031203 and its high peak - energy , and between its x - ray fluence extrapolated from the integral measurements ( sazonov et al .",
    "2004 ) and that inferred from the xmm - newton measurements ( vaughan et al .",
    "we also demonstrate that this interpretation can explain other puzzling grb observations .",
    "the cb model assumes that in core - collapse sn , after the collapse of the stellar core into a neutron star or a black hole , an accretion disk or a torus is produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage ( de rjula 1987 ) .",
    "a highly relativistic plasmoid ( cb ) of ordinary matter is emitted along the rotation axis when part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , as observed in microquasars ( e.g.  mirabel & rodrigez 1999 ; rodriguez & mirabel 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "a cb contains a thermal plasma with a power - law tail of knocked - on electrons from collisions with particles of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and swept - in ism electrons , which are fermi - accelerated and cool quickly by synchrotron emission from the strong equipartition magnetic field in the cb to a steady state distribution , @xmath6 with @xmath7 in the cb rest frame . as the jet of cbs coasts through the `` ambient light '' permeating the surroundings of the parent sn , the electrons enclosed in the cbs compton up - scatter photons to energies which , close to the cbs direction of motion , correspond to the @xmath0-rays of an ordinary grb and less close to it , to the x - rays of an xrf ( dar & de rjula 2003 ) .",
    "a cb also produces a narrow conical jet of high energy cosmic - ray electrons ( and nuclei ) along its motion ( e.g. , dar & de rjula 2003 ) .",
    "these electrons are of two origins : swept - in ism electrons which were fermi - accelerated in the cb and escaped out into the ism and ism electrons which were scattered elastically by the cb .",
    "these cosmic - ray electrons produce a second peak in the spectral energy flux of grbs and xrfs at a much higher energy , by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of `` ambient light '' permeating the surroundings of the parent sn .",
    "thus , the internal cb electrons and the external cosmic ray electrons produce , by ics of ambient light , a spectral - energy - density ( @xmath8 ) of @xmath0-rays with two peaks , like that observed in blazars ( e.g. , padovani & giommi 1995 ; wehrle et al . 1998 ) .",
    "normal grbs have their first peak - energy usually around a fraction of an mev and then their second peak - energy at a much higher energy .",
    "gamma - ray detectors on board satellites usually ran out of sensitivity / statistics well below the second peak - energy .",
    "however , high - energy photons with a flux much larger than that expected from the extrapolated decline of the first peak , have been discovered in a few cases of very bright grbs with instruments on board cgro ( e.g. hurley et al .",
    "1994 ; dingus et al .",
    "1995 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that such a high energy component is well described by the cb model .",
    "moreover , in very low - luminosity grbs / xrfs , which are far off - axis grbs , the first peak is in the @xmath4 range while the second peak is in the mev range , i.e. , the spacing between the peaks is relatively small and both peaks , or a significant fraction of both , may fall within the detection range of the ordinary xrf and grb detectors .",
    "a score of low - luminosity xrfs were detected by cgro , bepposax and hete ii .",
    "but , in the case of hete ii , its fregate detector could go only to 400 kev .",
    "batse on board cgro and grbm on board bepposax usually ran out of statistics / sensitivity well below the second peak , although a significant emission in excess of that expected from a simple power - law extrapolation of the low energy spectrum to higher energies was detected in some xrfs ( see e.g. , frontera et al .",
    "2004a , b ) . in this letter",
    "we first demonstrate that the peak - energy and the isotropic radiation energy emitted in the first peak satisfy well the simple correlation @xmath9^{1/3}\\ , , $ ] predicted by the cb model .",
    "grbs 980425 and 031203 , which appear to be exceptions , could have been far - off - axis grbs with a relatively small spacing between their kev and mev peaks , and therefore appeared as grbs with a  ` normal' peak - energy .",
    "we predict that simultaneous measurements with swift and glast of the spectral energy flux of ordinary grbs will resolve it into two peaks which shift to smaller energies during the grb pulse .",
    "let @xmath0 be the lorentz factor of a cb and @xmath10 be its doppler factor when viewed from an angle @xmath11 relative to its motion . in the cb model ( dar & de rjula 2003 ) ,",
    "the observed peak - energy of @xmath0-rays produced at a redshift @xmath12 by ics of thin thermal bremsstrahlung light around an sn , @xmath13 with a typical energy @xmath14 is given by , @xmath15 under the assumption of isotropic emission in the cb rest frame , doppler boosting and relativistic beaming yield a @xmath0-ray fluence @xmath16 of a grb pulse , which is proportional to @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total @xmath0-ray energy emitted in the cb rest frame .",
    "consequently , @xmath20 , the inferred ` grb isotropic @xmath0-ray energy ' in a grb pulse , * under the assumption of isotropic emission in the observer frame * , is @xmath21    in the cb model , the predicted grb spectrum from ics of ambient light with a thin thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum , by the electrons inside the cb , is , @xmath22\\over de } & \\propto & \\left({t_{eff}\\over e}\\right ) ^\\alpha\\ ; e^{-e / t_{eff}}+b\\ ;   ( 1-e^{-e / t_{eff}})\\ ; { \\left(t_{eff}\\over e\\right)}^\\beta\\nonumber\\\\ \\alpha&\\approx&1\\ ; ; \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\beta={p+2\\over 2}\\approx 2.1\\ , ,   \\label{totdist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 may deviate from their indicated values , because the ambient radiation may deviate from a thin thermal bremsstrahlung , and the power - law index of the accelerated and knocked - on electrons after cooling may be larger than @xmath27 and increase with time . also the temperature of the ambient light seen by the cb is decreasing with distance , approximately as @xmath28\\ } , \\label{tevol}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a constant . as was shown in dar & de rjula 2003 and in dado et al .",
    "2004 , eq .  ( [ totdist ] ) is practically indistinguishable from the phenomenological band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) and it is in good agreement with the measured spectrum of the photons in the first peak of the spectral - energy - density of ordinary grbs and xrfs .    if core collapse sne and their environments were all identical , and if their ejected cbs were also universal in number , mass , lorentz factor and velocity of expansion , all differences between grbs would depend only on the observer s position , determined by @xmath12 and the angle of observation , @xmath11 . for a distribution of lorentz factors that is narrowly peaked around @xmath30 ,",
    "the @xmath11-dependence is in practice the dependence on @xmath31 , the doppler factor .",
    "hence eqs .",

    "we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1ab ] parallel lines between which the observed values are expected to be spread because of the spread in the ` standard candle ' properties .",
    "the correlation predicted by the cb model is well satisfied except for grb 980425 and grb 031203 .",
    "in the cb model , the ism in front of the cbs is ionized by the beamed radiation from the highly relativistic cbs .",
    "the turbulent magnetic fields in the cbs accelerate the ionized ism particles , which they gather on their path , to an initial distribution , @xmath38 with @xmath39 in the cb rest frame . in a steady state situation , the electrons , which are trapped in the cb by its internal magnetic fields and cool quickly by synchrotron emission , reach a distribution , @xmath6 , while the electrons which escape the cb must have the hard `` injection spectrum '' , @xmath40 their cooling time in the ism is much longer than that of the electrons which are trapped magnetically inside the cbs , because the ism magnetic field is smaller by many orders of magnitude than that inside the cbs .    in the cb rest frame ,",
    "the lorentz boosted ambient light undergoes compton scattering from these two distributions and produces the first peak with the `` band function '' shape and a hard tail at higher energies with practically a `` time - independent '' spectral index 1.6 , @xmath41    the ism electrons which are scattered elastically by the highly relativistic cbs in the direction of the observer have an approximate lab energy , @xmath42 .",
    "because of their very large lorentz factor , @xmath43 the ambient photons which they scatter have much higher energies than those of the photons scattered by `` cold '' electrons in the cbs , and they are narrowly beamed along the electronsdirection of motion .",
    "hence , in the thomson regime they have approximately the thin thermal bremsstrahlung distribution of the ambient light boosted by @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 for @xmath47 the low energy side of the spectral energy density of this `` second peak '' has the simple shape , @xmath48    during the grb phase , the radius of a cb increases linearly with the distance @xmath49 from the explosion site while the density of the ambient light decreases like @xmath50 because of the slow cooling rate in the ism , the accumulated number of high energy electrons in the narrow beam produced by the highly relativistic cb is proportional to the ism mass swept up by the cb .",
    "thus , for a constant density - profile , the magnitude of the spectral energy density , which is proportional to the product of the swept - up mass and the density of the ambient light , increases linearly with distance , whereas it decreases like @xmath51 for a density - profile of a stellar wind which blows constantly and produces a density @xmath52 during the grb the deceleration of the cbs is negligible and the observer time is proportional to the distance .",
    "thus , for a constant density - profile the spectral energy density increases with time like @xmath53 whereas it decreases like @xmath54 for a `` windy '' density - profile .    in the thomson regime , the peak - energies are given approximately by @xmath55 consequently , @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57\\,,$ ] the peak energies of the first and second peak , respectively , are related through @xmath58\\approx { ( 1+z)\\ , [ e_p[1]]^2\\over t}\\ , .",

    "there are very few cases where grbs were measured over a very broad energy range and allow a comparison between the cb model predictions and the observations . here",
    "we shall limit the comparison to two grbs of particular interest .",

    "[ fig3]b we compare the photon spectral index of the hard tail component , @xmath71 as predicted by the cb model , eq .  ( [ hardtail ] ) , and its measured value by integral ( sazonov et al .",

    "we have shown that for grbs with known redshift , usually the peak - energy and the isotropic radiation energy of the first , ordinary peak satisfy well the simple correlation @xmath9^{1/3}\\ , , $ ] predicted by the cb model . however , grbs 980425 and 031203 have peak - energies much larger than those expected in the cb model from their very low luminosities .",
    "but , in very low luminosity grbs and xrfs which , in the cb model , are ordinary grbs viewed far off axis , the second peak moves down to the mev region and can dominate the soft @xmath0-ray region .",
    "we have shown that grbs 031203 and grb 980425 could have been such far - off - axis grbs with their first peak in the soft x - ray region but with a contribution from their second broad peak which dominates their x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission , as shown here explicitely for grb 031203 .",
    "we have also shown that the high energy component which was discovered in grb 941017 is well explained by the second peak .",
    "finally , we predict that simultaneous measurements with swift and glast will resolve the spectral energy flux of ordinary grbs / xrfs into a double peak spectrum whose peaks move to lower energies during the grb pulse .",
