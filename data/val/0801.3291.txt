    "one of the most important problems in condensed matter physics is to understand how particles are organized in a ground state .",
    "almost all the low energy properties of the system are determined by such an organization .",
    "mathematically , the ground state of @xmath0 particles is described by a wave function  a complex function of @xmath0 variables @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the coordinate of the @xmath3 particle .",
    "thus , the problem to understand the patterns of the many - particle organizations ( or in physical terms , to understand the quantum phases of many - particle systems ) is to classify the complex wave functions @xmath4 in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "such a classification problem is one of most fundamental problems in physics , since it determines the possible quantum phases of many - particle systems .",
    "due to the success of landau symmetry breaking theory in describing phases and phase transitions,@xcite for a long time , physicists believe that phases of matter are classified by their symmetry properties .",
    "mathematically , this is equivalent to believing that the wave functions are classified by their symmetry properties , for example whether the wave function is invariant under translation @xmath6 or not . under such a belief ,",
    "the wave functions with the same symmetries are grouped into one class and such a class represents a single phase of matter .",
    "this is why group theory becomes an important mathematical foundation in physics .",
    "however , after the discovery of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states,@xcite it was realized that symmetry is not enough to classify all the possible organizations encoded in the wave functions @xmath7 .",
    "this is because the wave functions that describe different fqh states have exactly the same symmetry .",
    "thus the wave functions of fqh states contain new kinds of organizations of particles that has nothing to do with symmetry.@xcite the new organizations of the particles are called topological orders .    intuitively , what is new in the fqh wave functions is that the wave functions contain a long - range quantum entanglement.@xcite this is why the fqh wave functions describe new states of matter that can not be described by symmetries .",
    "the wave functions with long - range entanglements and the corresponding topological orders not only appear in fqh systems , they also appear in various quantum spin systems . understanding this new class of wave functions and the resulting new states of matter is currently a very active research direction in condensed matter physics.@xcite    to gain a deeper and more precise understanding of topological orders and the associated long - range entanglements , we need to solve the related mathematical problem of classifying @xmath4 in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "this is a difficult problem which is not well studied in mathematics .",
    "the problem is not even well defined . but",
    "this does not mean that the problem is not important .",
    "it is common not to have a well defined problem when we wander into an unknown territory .",
    "the first task of knowing the unknown is usually to come up with a proper definition of the problem .    in this paper , we will not attempt to classify generic complex wave functions @xmath7 .",
    "we limit ourselves to a simpler problem of trying to classify fqh states and their topological orders .",
    "( for a review on topological order in fqh states , see . )",
    "the corresponding mathematical problem is to classify symmetric and anti - symmetry polynomials of @xmath0 variables @xmath8 in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "we will first try to come up with a physically meaningful and mathematically rigorous definition of the problem .",
    "then we will solve the problem in some simple cases .",
    "this leads to a class of `` simple '' ( anti-)symmetric polynomials which corresponds to a class of `` simple '' fqh states .",
    "the constructed fqh states include both abelian and non - abelian fqh states.@xcite",
    "first we would like to give a brief review on fqh theory .",
    "a fqh state is a quantum ground state of two dimensional electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "such a quantum state is described by a complex wave function @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the coordinates of the @xmath3 electron and @xmath0 the total number of electrons . in the strong magnetic field limit , if the filling fraction @xmath11 of a fqh state is less than 1 , then all the electrons are in the lowest landau level . in this case , the ground state wave function has the following form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a holomorphic function of @xmath15 [ @xmath14 does not depend on @xmath16 . since @xmath17 has no poles , @xmath17 is a polynomial of @xmath15 s .    due to the fermi statistics of the electrons ,",
    "@xmath17 must be an antisymmetric polynomial .",
    "if we assume the electrons to have a bose statistics , then @xmath17 must be a symmetric polynomial .",
    "so to understand the phases of fqh systems is to classify antisymmetric or symmetric polynomials .",
    "it turns out that for every antisymmetric polynomials @xmath18 , one can uniquely construct a symmetric polynomials @xmath19 . thus classifying anti - symmetric polynomials and classifying symmetric polynomials are almost identical problems .",
    "so in this paper , we will assume electrons to have a bose statistics and concentrate on classifying symmetric polynomials .    for a system of @xmath0 bosonic electrons , which symmetric polynomial will represent the ground state of the system",
    "? it will depend on the interaction between the electrons .",
    "if the interaction potential between two electrons has a @xmath20-function form @xmath21 then the ground state is described by the symmetric polynomial @xmath22 such a state has a vanishing total potential energy @xmath23 , where @xmath24 the vanishing of the total potential energy @xmath25 requires that the wave function @xmath26 to be zero as @xmath27 . since the average energy @xmath28 for any wave functions , the vanishing @xmath25 for @xmath29 indicates that @xmath29 is the ground state .",
    "if the interaction potential between two electrons is given by@xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , then the ground state will be @xmath33 for interaction , the vanishing of the total potential energy @xmath25 not only requires that the wave function @xmath26 to be zero as @xmath27 , it also requires @xmath26 to vanish faster than @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the symmetric polynomial must have a fourth order zero as @xmath36 .",
    "one such polynomial is given by @xmath37 which has the lowest total power of @xmath15 s .",
    "more complicated ground states can be obtained through more complicated interactions .",
    "for example , consider the following three - body interaction between electrons@xcite @xmath38 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the total symmetrization operator between @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "such an interaction selects the following symmetric polynomial@xcite @xmath43 to describe the ground state ( which has a vanishing total potential energy @xmath25 ) . here",
    "@xmath44 is the total antisymmetrization operator between @xmath45 .",
    "three symmetric polynomials @xmath29 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 contain different topological orders and correspond to three different phases of an @xmath0-electron system in the @xmath48 limit .",
    "they are the filling fraction @xmath49 laughlin state,@xcite the filling fraction @xmath50 laughlin state , and the filling fraction @xmath51 pffafian state.@xcite we would like to find a classification of symmetric polynomials such that the above three symmetric polynomials belong to three different classes .",
    "the above three examples share some common properties .",
    "the hamiltonians described by the interaction potentials @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are all positive definite and contain zero - energy eigenstates .",
    "the zero - energy eigenstates of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are known and are given by @xmath29 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "thus @xmath29 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are exact ground states of the corresponding hamiltonians .",
    "since the interaction potentials are constructed from @xmath20-functions and their derivatives , the exact ground states ( the zero - energy states ) for such type of potentials are characterized by the pattern of zeros , the orders of zeros of the ground state wave function as we bring two or more electrons together .    in this paper , we will concentrate on such ideal hamiltonians and their exact zero - energy ground states . from this point of view , classifying fqh states corresponds to classifying patterns of zeros in symmetric polynomials . in other words , for each pattern of zeros , we can define an ideal hamiltonian such that the symmetric polynomials with the given pattern of zeros will be the zero energy ground states of the hamiltonian .",
    "such symmetric polynomials will describe a phase of a fqh system , _ provided that the hamiltonian has a finite energy gap_.    clearly , for the ideal hamiltonians , apart from the zero - energy ground states , other eigenstates of the hamiltonian all have non - zero and positive energies .",
    "but this does not imply the hamiltonian to have a finite energy gap .",
    "only when the minimal energy of the excitations has a finite non - zero limit when electron number approaches to infinity , does the hamiltonian have a finite energy gap .",
    "so to classify the fqh states , we not only need to classify the patterns of zeros and the associated ideal hamiltonians , we also need to judge if the constructed ideal hamiltonian has a finite energy gap or not . at the moment , we do not have a good way to make such a judgement .",
    "so here , we will concentrate on classifying the patterns of zeros and the associated zero energy states .",
    "in order to classify translation invariant symmetric polynomials of @xmath0 variables @xmath17 in the @xmath5 limit , we need to define the polynomials for any @xmath0 .",
    "the key in our definition is to introduce `` local conditions '' .",
    "those local conditions apply to polynomials of any numbers of variables .    from the discussion in the section [ fqh ]",
    ", we see that one way to implement the local condition is to let one variable to approach another and to specify the power of the zero @xmath56 we would like to stress that the above local condition is consistent with the translation invariance of the polynomial .",
    "however , @xmath57 does not contain all the information that is needed to specify various interesting polynomials . to implement more general local conditions ,",
    "we need to bring three or more variables together and specify the patterns of zeros.@xcite    to describe the patterns of zeros in a systematic way , we obtain from a polynomial @xmath17 another polynomial @xmath58 by letting @xmath27 : @xmath59 here @xmath60 means equal up to a non - zero complex constant .",
    "the value of @xmath57 encodes a part of the local conditions",
    ". then we let @xmath61 in @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "in this way , we obtain a new polynomial @xmath65 . in general",
    "we obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a type-@xmath68 variable obtained by fusing @xmath68 @xmath15-variables together .",
    "note that @xmath69 is the original variable .",
    "if we view @xmath70 as coordinates of electrons , then @xmath71 are coordinates of bound states of @xmath68 electrons .",
    "we will call such a bound state a type-@xmath68 particle .",
    "@xmath66 is a symmetric polynomial that is symmetric between variables of the same type .",
    "it satisfies certain local conditions and form a hilbert space .",
    "the polynomial @xmath66 is also called a derived polynomial since it is obtained from @xmath72 by fusing variables together .",
    "the general local conditions on @xmath72 are specified by pattern of zeros in its derived polynomial @xmath66 : @xmath73 where @xmath55 satisfy @xmath74 @xmath75 is the set of data that specifies the local condition that @xmath72 s must satisfy .",
    "such a set of data is called a pattern of zeros .",
    "we note that there are many different ways to fuse @xmath68 @xmath15-variables into a @xmath67 variable .",
    "the different ways of fusion may lead to different derived polynomials which are linearly independent . here",
    "we will impose a unique - fusion condition on the symmetric polynomial @xmath72 : _ the derived polynomials obtained from different ways of fusions are always linearly dependent , _ the derived polynomials form a one - dimensional linear space . in this paper , we will study symmetric polynomials @xmath72 that satisfy this unique - fusion condition and are characterized by the data @xmath55 .",
    "not all possible choices of @xmath75 are consistent .",
    "only certain choices of @xmath75 correspond to symmetric polynomials @xmath72 .",
    "the key is to find those @xmath75 s that can be realized by some polynomials @xmath72 .    to get a feeling what a consistent set of @xmath75 may look like ,",
    "let us consider the following symmetric polynomials ( the laughlin state@xcite ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an even integer .",
    "such a symmetric polynomial leads to the following derived polynomial @xmath78\\big\\ } \\big\\ { \\prod_{a } \\big [ \\prod_{i < j } ( z^{(a)}_i - z^{(a)}_j)^{qa^2 } \\big]\\big\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the symmetric polynomial @xmath79 is specified by the pattern of zeros : @xmath80 where @xmath77 is a positive even integer .      there is another way to implement local conditions on a translation invariant symmetric polynomial @xmath72 .",
    "we introduce a sequence of integers @xmath81 , @xmath82 and require that the minimal total powers of @xmath83 in @xmath72 is given by @xmath81.@xcite ( here @xmath84 is defined to be 0 . ) thus , in addition to @xmath75 , we can also use @xmath85 to characterize a symmetric polynomial . for a translation invariant symmetric polynomial , @xmath86 .",
    "thus @xmath87 .    the two characterizations , @xmath75 and @xmath85 , are closely related .",
    "one way to see the relation is to put the symmetric polynomial @xmath17 on a sphere as discussed in appendix [ elesph ] .",
    "let @xmath88 be the maximum power of @xmath40 in @xmath17",
    ". then @xmath17 can be put on a sphere with @xmath88 flux quanta and each variable @xmath15 carries an angular momentum @xmath89 .    from the discussion near the end of appendix [ elesph ] , we find that each type-@xmath68 particle described by @xmath71 in @xmath66 carries a definite angular momentum , which is denoted as @xmath90 .",
    "since the lowest total power of @xmath83 is @xmath81 , the minimal total @xmath91 quantum number for those variables is @xmath92 .",
    "therefore the angular momentum of the @xmath71 variable is @xmath93 since @xmath69 , we find that @xmath94 .    again , according to the discussion near the end of appendix [ elesph ] , if we fuse two variables @xmath67 and @xmath95 into @xmath96 , the type-@xmath97 particle described by @xmath96 will carry an angular momentum @xmath98    we see that @xmath55 can be expressed in terms of @xmath81 : @xmath99 the conditions on @xmath55 , , can be translated into the conditions on @xmath81 : @xmath100    from the recursive relation @xmath101 , we find @xmath102 .",
    "using @xmath87 , we see that @xmath81 can also be calculated from @xmath55 : @xmath103 due to the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath75 and @xmath85 , we will also call the sequence @xmath85 a pattern of zeros .",
    "the symmetric polynomial @xmath17 can be written as a sum of polynomials described by boson occupations @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a boson occupation state with @xmath106 bosons occupying the @xmath107 orbital .",

    "what kinds of boson occupations @xmath117 appear in the above sum ?",
    "let us set @xmath118 in @xmath72 .",

    "the boson occupation distributions @xmath117 that appear in the sum in satisfy certain conditions .",
    "first the boson occupation @xmath117 can be described by a pattern of zeros @xmath139 .",
    "then the conditions on @xmath117 can be stated as @xmath140 .",
    "so the minimal total power of @xmath83 in @xmath141 is @xmath142 which is equal or bigger than @xmath81 .",
    "haldane@xcite has conjectured that @xmath143 s in the expression can be obtained from @xmath116 by one or many squeezing operations .",
    "a squeezing operation is a two - particle operation that moves one particle from the orbital @xmath144 to @xmath145 and the other from @xmath123 to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
