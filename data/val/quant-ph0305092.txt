    "entanglement is the basis for fundamental demonstrations of quantum mechanics such as violation of bell s inequality and tests of local realism @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is essential to a wide variety of quantum communication applications , including teleportation @xcite and quantum secret sharing @xcite , and it can be used for quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "a high - flux source of polarization - entangled photons is therefore desirable for practical implementation of a variety of entanglement - based applications .",
    "spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) in a noncollinearly propagating , angle phase - matched crystal , such as beta barium borate ( bbo ) , is often used to generate polarization entanglement @xcite . however",
    ", only a small segment of the output cone of the downconverted photons is collectible .",
    "moreover , angle phase matching precludes the use of long crystals for more efficient generation or for narrowband generation in a cavity configuration .",
    "we take a different , yet simple , approach to entanglement generation that is based on periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) with collinear propagation of the pump , signal , and idler fields . a periodically - poled nonlinear crystal such as ppktp , with an appropriate grating period , permits efficient three - wave mixing at user - selectable wavelengths within the crystal s transparency window by the technique of quasi - phase matching ( qpm ) . under qpm",
    "one can choose to propagate along a principal axis of the crystal , thus avoiding undesirable angle walkoff and permitting collinear propagation in long crystals , which can be utilized in cavity configurations for enhancing downconversion efficiency and providing high - brightness narrowband outputs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a single - beam configuration of co - propagating signal and idler photons simplifies the transport of entangled photon pairs . for the current work",
    "we report measurements of single - beam quantum interference with a visibility of up to 99% and bell s inequality violation from a continuous - wave ( cw ) ppktp parametric downconverter .",
    "figure  1 shows the basic concept of our cw collinearly propagating single - beam spdc for polarization entanglement .",
    "it consists of a length-@xmath1 type - ii phase - matched ppktp crystal followed by a length-@xmath2 ktp timing compensator .",
    "consider the probability amplitudes of a single pair of downconverted signal and idler photons that originate , via quantum superposition , from two locations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are symmetrically displaced from the center of the periodically - poled crystal .",
    "because of the crystal s birefringence , the horizontally ( @xmath5 ) polarized signal photon along the crystal s @xmath6 axis always exits the crystal ahead of the conjugate idler photon , which is vertically ( @xmath7 ) polarized along the crystal s @xmath8 axis .",
    "the timing compensator in fig .",
    "1 is a ktp crystal that is oriented similar to the ppktp crystal but with the @xmath6 and @xmath8 axes interchanged .",
    "time - resolved signal and idler photon counting before the compensating crystal will collapse the quantum superposition .",
    "this will tag the location@xmath3 or @xmath4at which the pair was created by virtue of the time difference between the signal and idler counts . after the compensator , the signal and idler pair is at a quantum superposition of locations @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with either @xmath11 leading @xmath12 or @xmath13 leading @xmath14 by the same time interval .",
    "the temporal information has been erased because the separation of the photon pair no longer reveals the source location in the ppktp .",
    "although the timing compensator has erased one feature that distinguishes the signal and idler photons , they are still distinguishable by virtue of their orthogonal polarizations .",
    "this polarization information can be erased , however , by rotating the output polarizations by @xmath15 , before analysis along @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the erasure of such identifying information is essential to all quantum interference experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is also necessary to erase any frequency or spatial mode information , which might distinguish between photons in a detected pair , by collecting only collinear and degenerate pairs .",
    "ignoring the vacuum and higher photon - number components , the state at the output of this polarization rotation is the biphoton , @xmath16 the photons labeled 1 and 2 can be analyzed with a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) and a null should occur in coincidence measurements .",
    "this coincidence null is equivalent to the coincidence dip in hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometry @xcite .",
    "it is possible to utilize the single - beam spdc output of fig .  1 to obtain polarization - entangled photons with a 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "each photon of the orthogonally - polarized photon pair that is generated from the ppktp is equally likely to be transmitted or reflected at the beam splitter .",
    "hence half of the generated pairs yield one photon in the transmitted path and one in the reflected path .",
    "if we post - select only these events , the two photons in the two paths are in a polarization - entangled triplet state : @xmath17 where the subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to the transmitted and reflected paths of the 50/50 beam splitter , respectively .",
    "we note that post selection is not necessary if quantum memories that allow non - destructive loading verification are used @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the single - beam downconversion scheme in the setup shown in fig .  2 .",
    "a 10-mm - long flux - grown ppktp crystal with a grating period of 8.84 @xmath20 m was used for frequency - degenerate type - ii quasi - phase matched operation at a pump wavelength of 397 nm .",
    "the output wavelength at 795 nm was chosen to match the transition wavelength of the @xmath21 line of rb , which has been proposed for use as a trapped - atom quantum memory for long - distance teleportation @xcite .",
    "the 1-mm - thick ppktp crystal was anti - reflection coated at 397 and 795 nm and was pumped with a 10-mw cw external - cavity ultraviolet ( uv ) diode laser that was weakly focused to a @xmath22200-@xmath20 m beam waist in the crystal .",
    "the crystal was set up for collinear propagation along its @xmath23 axis and with its @xmath6 axis aligned with the pump s horizontal polarization . for type - ii phase matching , the nonlinear coefficient @xmath24 was utilized , and the signal and idler outputs were orthogonally polarized along the crystal s @xmath6 and @xmath8 axes , respectively .",
    "the operating temperature of the ppktp crystal was controlled with a thermoelectric cooler that allowed us to tune the crystal to exact frequency degeneracy and was typically set at 20@xmath25c . after passing through the 5-mm - long ktp timing compensator to erase the timing information",
    ", the output beam was sent through an interference filter centered at 795 nm that had a 1-nm bandwidth and 80% in - band transmission .",
    "we have imaged the downconverted light through the 1-nm interference filter onto a high - sensitivity ccd camera , and found this light had a divergence full angle of @xmath2220 mrad , in good agreement with theoretical estimates of the external divergence angle for our ppktp system . due to our propagation along one of the principal axes in ppktp ,",
    "the observed divergence angle of 20-mrad / nm of bandwidth is more than an order of magnitude larger than that for the usual angle phase - matched configuration in bbo for a given crystal length and spectral bandwidth @xcite .",
    "there were some uv - induced fluorescence photons from the flux - grown ppktp crystal .",
    "these fluorescence photons , estimated to be @xmath221000/s / mw of pump generated in a 1-nm bandwidth and collected through a small iris , increased the singles rates by @xmath225% .",
    "accidental coincidences caused by them were relatively insignificant in our experiments .",
    "we installed two dichroic mirrors that passed the 795-nm outputs but attenuated the uv pump by @xmath2240 db to minimize additional fluorescence from the ktp timing compensator and other optical elements .",
    "an adjustable iris was used to control the effective divergence angle of the transmitted beam . a smaller iris",
    "increased the depth of field and reduced the spatial resolution of the output photons such that the photons generated from locations @xmath3 and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "1 would be spatially indistinguishable .",
    "the iris also served to block off - axis , nearly - degenerate photon pairs that would not contribute to either quantum interference or polarization entanglement .    for quantum - interference measurements , the 50/50 beam splitter in fig .",
    "2 was not necessary .",
    "removing this beam splitter improves the conditional detection probability by a factor of two , and we have made measurements with and without it present . with the 50/50 beam splitter present , each output beam was sent through a half - wave plate ( hwp ) , a pbs for polarization analysis , and a clean - up polarizer to eliminate the leakage of horizontally - polarized light into the vertically - polarized path .",
    "also , prisms were used in the horizontally - polarized output paths to reduce accidental counts due to the uv pump .",
    "all four pbs outputs were focused on commercial si single - photon counting detectors , whose detection quantum efficiencies are estimated to be 50 - 55% at 795 nm and whose dark count rates are less than 100/s .",
    "we then combined the @xmath2235-ns - long electrical pulses from detectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 with and logic , and both the singles rates from the detector output pulses and the coincidence rate from the logic pulses were counted .",
    "the dead times of our single - photon counters ( including the pulse width ) were measured to be @xmath2250 ns , which is negligible at our operating count rates of 10@xmath28/s or less . by blocking the pump and measuring the singles and coincidence rates due to different amounts of stray light for the four detectors , we were able to determine the effective coincidence window for each pair of detectors and calibrate the accidental coincidence rates , for removal in post - detection data analysis .",
    "typical rates , with the 50/50 beam splitter in place , were @xmath29 singles / s , pair coincidences of 1,200/s in a @xmath2270-ns coincidence window , and accidental coincidences of @xmath2212/s for 10 mw of pump and 1-nm detection bandwidth .",
    "the main contribution to the accidental coincidences is the poisson occurrence of a double pair within the coincidence window in which the signal of one pair and the idler of the other pair are detected .",
    "the reliability of the logical and coincidence detection and the data analysis methodology was checked by comparing it to a high time - resolution ( sub - ns ) start - stop histogram obtained with a picoquant timeharp 200 .",
    "consider the case without the 50/50 beam splitter and with only the detectors labeled @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig .  2 in use .",
    "pbs@xmath30 in the transmitted path and the crystal s @xmath6 and @xmath8 axes were aligned such that if the hwp@xmath30 s fast and slow axes were also aligned the same way , the signal and idler photons would be separately detected to yield the pair generation rate . when hwp@xmath30 was set at @xmath31 to yield zero polarization rotation and",
    "the iris was open , we observed a coincidence rate as high as @xmath32/s , from which we infer a pair generation rate of @xmath2210@xmath33/s using our 21% conditional detection efficiency . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the output beam underwent a @xmath15 polarization rotation , and each incident photon had a 50/50 chance of being transmitted or reflected at pbs@xmath30 .",
    "for photon pairs that were spectrally , spatially , and temporally indistinguishable , the state after hwp@xmath30 was given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and quantum interference between the signal and idler of a photon pair occurred , resulting in a reduction in the coincidence rate .",
    "when we made the photons distinguishable , by frequency detuning , no quantum interference occurred and a coincidence rate of 50% relative to the zero - rotation rate was observed . with the iris open and @xmath35",
    ", we observed a coincidence rate of 11,800/s , corresponding to a visibility @xmath36/[c(0)+c(\\pi/8)]$ ] of 59% , where @xmath37 is the coincidence rate at a hwp@xmath30 angle setting of @xmath38 .",
    "as we reduced the size of the iris , the effective divergence angle was reduced and the depth of field improved , leading to a reduction in the coincidence rates and an increase in the visibility .",
    "we have achieved @xmath39 with a 200-@xmath20m - diameter aperture , corresponding to a divergence full angle of @xmath222 mrad , for the flux - grown ppktp downconverter .",
    "we have also made similar quantum interference measurements with a second ppktp crystal , which was hydrothermally grown and had a grating period of 9.01 @xmath20 m .",
    "this 10-mm - long crystal was pumped with the second harmonic of a ti : sapphire laser centered at 397 nm with a maximum usable power of @xmath2230 mw . the tunable uv pump source and the temperature tuning of the ppktp crystal permitted us to maintain the spdc operating point at exact frequency degeneracy for the collinearly propagating portion of the output .",
    "typical pump powers were 5 mw and the crystal temperature was usually set at 30@xmath25c .",
    "we added a collimating lens for the output beam and an adjustable iris was used to control the depth of field .",
    "the conditional detection efficiency for the hydrothermally grown ppktp setup was @xmath2225% for a 3-mm - diameter aperture and a 3-nm interference filter .",
    "figure 3 shows the quantum - interference visibility as a function of the aperture size for four different interference - filter bandwidths . at the aperture size of 1 mm , which is equivalent to a divergence full angle of 5.4 mrad",
    ", we observed a visibility of @xmath40% for the 1-nm filter .",
    "figure 3 clearly shows that for larger aperture sizes , which correspond to shallower depths of field at the crystal , the visibility is reduced .",
    "this reduction occurred because spatial and spectral indistinguishability was no longer fully maintained .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "3 shows the detected coincidence rate as a function of the aperture size for the case of the 1-nm filter . at the highest visibility level of 99% ,",
    "obtained with a 1-mm aperture , the measured coincidence rate was @xmath22300/s / mw of pump power , which is one of the highest reported values at near - unity visibility level for an entanglement source @xcite .",
    "moreover , for an aperture size of 3 mm , with a corresponding divergence angle of 16 mrad , we measured a flux of over 5000/s / mw of pump while maintaining a visibility of 90% .",
    "we should note that the hydrothermally grown ppktp crystal was found to be more efficient ( with @xmath41 pm / v ) than the flux - grown ppktp crystal ( @xmath42 pm / v ) .",
    "in addition , the uv - induced fluorescence of the hydrothermally grown ppktp was about 25% of that for the flux - grown crystal .",
    "one can easily obtain polarization - entangled photon pairs using the experimental setup in fig .  2 .",
    "each member of an orthogonally - polarized photon pair that is generated in the ppktp downconverter has a 50% chance of being transmitted or reflected by the 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "when one photon appears in the transmitted path and one in the reflected path  something that can be post - selected by monitoring for coincidences  the joint state of the beam splitter s output is the polarization - entangled triplet given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    the quality of the single - beam polarization entanglement can be evaluated by measuring the violation of the clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) form of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "we have made such bell s inequality measurements using the diode - pumped flux - grown ppktp downconverter with a 1-nm interference filter and @xmath2210 mw of pump power . referring to fig .  2 ,",
    "the light in the transmitted path and in the reflected path of the 50/50 beam splitter were separately analyzed with a hwp and a pbs .",
    "simultaneous coincidence measurements between detectors @xmath26 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , detectors @xmath27 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , and detectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath47 ) , as indicated in fig .  2 , were taken for two different @xmath38 settings of 0 and @xmath48 for the transmitted beam .",
    "the hwp@xmath30 s angle setting @xmath38 was ascertained by quantum - interference measurements in the transmitted path using @xmath47 . at each @xmath38 angle ,",
    "coincidence measurements @xmath44 and @xmath46 over a 10-s interval were taken at 32 different positions of the hwp@xmath49 s setting ( @xmath50 at @xmath22@xmath51 intervals ) in the reflected path of the 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "these coincidence measurements were used to calculate the value of the chsh inequality .",
    "figure  4 shows the coincidence counts @xmath44 for @xmath52 and for @xmath53 and their sinusoidal fits , showing visibilities of 98% and 93% , respectively .",
    "the four coincidence - count data sets of @xmath44 and @xmath46 for @xmath52 and @xmath34 are fit to sinusoidal functions . using these four fits ( with their estimated errors )",
    "we construct the chsh expectation @xmath54 functions and the @xmath55 parameter function @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 is defined by :    @xmath56    note that @xmath54 depends on @xmath57 and @xmath58 which were not directly measured , so we derive their values from the fits of @xmath44 and @xmath46 with @xmath59 : @xmath60 the parameter @xmath55 is composed of @xmath54 functions for two values of @xmath50 and two values for @xmath38 . in our case @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus our @xmath55 parameter is defined as : @xmath63 classical and hidden variable theories predict @xmath64 , while quantum mechanics permits @xmath65 , with equality occurring for maximal polarization entanglement , i.e. , a polarization bell state such as the triplet from eq .",
    "we obtained an @xmath55 value of @xmath0 , which indicates good polarization entanglement of our ppktp spdc source .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated a cw high - flux source of polarization - entangled photons using a ppktp parametric downconverter in a collinearly propagating configuration .",
    "the single - beam output is shown to allow easy control of its spatial and spectral contents and simplify the transport of the photon pairs . by using a circular aperture",
    "we were able to obtain a high visibility of 99% with a corresponding flux of @xmath22300/s / mw of pump power .",
    "polarization entanglement was obtained from the cw single - beam ppktp downconverter with a 50/50 beam splitter , and we measured bell s inequality violation with @xmath66 . we have found that the use of periodically - poled nonlinear material and the single - beam collinearly propagating configuration offer distinct advantages over the usual noncollinearly phase - matched bbo downconverter .",
    "wavelength tunability of the paired photons with no change in the output beam angle can be easily accomplished with temperature tuning of the crystal and/or a change in the pump wavelength .",
    "long crystals with collinear outputs can be used to allow more efficient generation and collection of entangled photons .",
    "we expect that future entanglement sources based on cavity - enhanced parametric downconversion in long crystals can significantly improve on its flux and also its spatial and spectral contents @xcite .",
