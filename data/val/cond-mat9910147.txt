    "since the pioneering work of nesterenko @xcite there has been an increase of activity devoted to the study of wave propagation in granular media .",
    "the theoretical prediction of solitons - like waves propagating in one dimensional chains of perfect elastic spheres has been experimentally checked by lazaridi and nesterenko @xcite and more recently by coste , falcon and fauve @xcite .",
    "these studies concern the idealized case of spheres interacting according to the hertz law where the interaction force depends on the overlap distance of the spheres to the power @xmath3 .",
    "the result of nesterenko for the particular hertzian case can actually be generalized to an interaction law where the exponent can vary from one to infinity @xcite , the case of the exponent equal to unity being special since it leads to a self - similar asymmetric pulse propagation resulting from a shock perturbation @xcite . instead of traveling as a soliton the pulse propagates increasing its width and decreasing its amplitude .",
    "it was then showed that the amplitude decreases like @xmath4 and the width increases like @xmath5 .",
    "this generalization of the interaction law by letting the interaction exponent vary allows us to take into account the various shapes of two interacting beads .    besides isolating non - linearities in one dimensional chains other physical ingredients",
    "have been added in order to make these models more realistic .",
    "sinkovits and sen @xcite did molecular dynamics simulations on gravitationally compacted hertzian chains .",
    "it was then observed that gravitation makes waves loose their soliton - like features becoming solitary waves with the wave speed increasing with depth @xmath6 as @xmath7 as predicted by hertz law .",
    "besides , if an impurity is placed in the chain , the propagating wave is scattered by it and a reflected wave is obtained in addition to the transmitted wave , these waves having a similar shape as the incident wave .",
    "following these first results hong , ji and kim @xcite extracted several power laws for the velocity amplitude of a wave propagating in a gravitationally compacted chain .",
    "it was shown that in a homogeneous chain of beads the amplitude velocity of the solitary pulse decreases like @xmath8 for an interaction law exponent @xmath0 greater than unity .",
    "this power law is only valid in the case of a small perturbation where the non - linear interaction law can be locally linearized , the stiffness coefficient then varying with depth .    in this paper , we present molecular dynamics results for non - loaded horizontal granular chains containing impurities . in our model",
    "the force interaction law exponent is allowed to vary from one to infinity , the hertzian case being considered as a special one . after having reviewed the theoretical results for shock propagation in a horizontal bead chain and their relevance in reproducing the results from numerical simulations we study the interaction of shock waves with impurities of various masses .",
    "we show that the patterns observed for the scattered waves vary as impurity masses are larger or smaller than the mass of the beads constituting the granular chain . in the case of a light impurity",
    "we observed a backscattered solitary wave followed by an increasing number of secondary waves of decreasing amplitudes produced at the impurity location .",
    "these secondary waves also propagate in the forward direction following the transmitted wave .",
    "we looked at the displacement of the impurity after the collision .",
    "the impurity actually oscillates in a ballistic motion around its equilibrium position .",
    "these oscillations are damped since the impurity collides its nearest neighbors producing a backward and a forward moving pulse in each cycle .",
    "if we consider the interaction of a shock with an heavy impurity we obtain a very different scenario . instead of exciting the impurity",
    "the shock only shifts it in its moving direction .",
    "the chain is then halved in two separated chains on which propagate several pulses .",
    "the situation is no more symmetric as in the previous case .",
    "after the collision the incident wave does not produce a stable transmitted wave but is decomposed in a series of pulses of decreasing amplitudes . before the impurity we observe the propagation of a stable reflected solitary wave . in each case",
    "the amplitude of the reflected pulse grows with the absolute value of the difference between the mass of the impurity and the normal mass .",
    "hence the speed of the reflected pulse grows with this mass difference since the speed of our solitary waves increases with the amplitude .    in section",
    "@xmath9 we present the model and its analytical solution in the continuum limit .",
    "this solution is compared to the numerical simulations as the interaction law exponent is tuned from unity to large values . in section",
    "@xmath10 we analyze the interaction of these shock waves with an impurity and display the energy distribution in the bead chain after the scattering with the impurity .",
    "a conclusion is given in section @xmath11 .",
    "the horizontal granular chain consists of @xmath12 touching beads of equal sizes and masses .",
    "the repulsive interaction force between two adjacent beads under compression is written @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the overlap of the beads .",
    "for the exponent @xmath0 equal to @xmath15 we have the hertz law for perfectly spherical beads and the stiffness constant @xmath16 can be expressed as a function of the spheres radii , the young modulus and the poisson ratio of the material . here",
    "we let @xmath0 vary from one to infinity considering beads with different geometries .",
    "the equation of motion for the displacement @xmath17 of the bead @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 in terms of the displacements of the beads @xmath20 and @xmath21 one can write @xmath22 the heaviside function having been introduced in order to have no tension forces .    this equation has been solved by nesterenko @xcite in the case of a shock perturbation by doing a long wavelength development",
    ". this approximation will be valid if the spatial extension of the wave generated by the shock is much greater than the size of a single bead . assuming this we write @xmath17 as @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , since we are solving the equation for a wave in which the beads are compressed one can get rid of the heaviside functions . the resulting equation is written @xmath24 where a is the dimension of the bead and we developed @xmath25 and @xmath26 to fourth order .",
    "we then rewrite the equation @xmath27 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath28 @xmath29 being of order @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dimension of the pulse and expand the powers in taylor series to the order @xmath32 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath33 looking for traveling wave solutions @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the speed of the wave , a longer calculation @xcite gives us for the deformation @xmath36 with @xmath37 this periodic wave solution is singular since it violates the condition @xmath38 in eq.([cond ] ) .",
    "we actually get the shock wave solution by imposing the argument of the cosines to vary in the interval @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 . from the expression above we easily extract the wave speed @xmath35 : @xmath41 @xmath42 being the maximum of the velocity pulse .",
    "the accuracy of this analytical approximation has been tested numerically with a gear fifth order predictor - corrector algorithm on a horizontal chain of @xmath43 beads with free boundary conditions .",
    "a shock perturbation is imposed on the chain by giving the first bead a @xmath44 speed at zero time .",
    "we choose beads of mass @xmath45 and stiffness @xmath46 .",
    "we first looked at the shape of the deformation profile of the bead number @xmath47 as function of time and compared it with with the shape given by the expression ( [ cos ] ) for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we displayed in fig.([cos1.2 ] ) , fig.([cos1.5 ] ) and fig.([cos1.7 ] ) the superposition of numerical and analytical curves for @xmath0 equal to @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "one easily sees on these curves that the analytical results are rather good for low values of @xmath0 @xmath51 showing discrepancies when @xmath0 is increased",
    ". actually , the tails of the deformations curves are much longer than the ones given by equation ( [ cos ] ) .",
    "if the value of @xmath0 is increased to higher values the numerical and analytical results become completely different as one can see in fig.([cos10 ] ) where we took @xmath0 equal to @xmath52 .",
    "other discrepancies can be found if @xmath0 is taken in the neighborhood of unity .",
    "it can be seen in fig.([cos1.01 ] ) that the deformation curve on the bead number @xmath47 is not symmetric when @xmath0 is taken equal to @xmath53 .",
    "this non - symmetric shape actually evolves to a symmetric one as the pulse propagate .",
    "we simulated a chain of @xmath54 beads and considered the deformation of the bead number @xmath55 : the pulse has the soliton shape given by equation ( [ cos ] ) ( fig.([cos1.01.b ] ) ) .",
    "the pulse has actually to propagate over @xmath55 beads before reaching its solitonic regime predicted by ( [ cos ] ) .",
    "in fact , there is a cross - over between a nonlinearity - dominated regime and a solitonic regime where dispersion is balanced by nonlinearity .",
    "the non - linearity dominated regime corresponds to a transient where the amplitude of the pulse decreases slowly in time before reaching a constant value , i.e , the solitonic regime . at the same time",
    "the width of the pulse increases also reaching a stationary value .",
    "moreover the shape of the pulse evolves continuously from a non - symmetric one to a symmetric one .",
    "the time of the transient obviously increases as we decrease @xmath0 ( if we take @xmath56 the pulse has to propagate over @xmath57 beads before reaching its stationary value ) .",
    "this cross - over behavior can be understood by looking at equation ( [ eq ] ) for @xmath0 close to one .",
    "we can rewrite this equation with a small parameter @xmath58 where @xmath59 : @xmath60 if we consider @xmath61 constant equal to one we obtain the long wavelength equation for the linear springs chain which is the same as the simple wave equation up to a dispersive term , the fourth order derivate of the displacement .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the velocity solution of this equation is not a soliton but a non - symmetric self - similar wave of decreasing amplitude and increasing width , the amplitude going to zero and the width going to infinity as time goes to infinity . for @xmath0 close to one the non - linearity @xmath61 vary slowly and the time for it to balance the action of the dispersive four order term increases as @xmath58 goes to zero .",
    "we can actually calculate how the amplitude and the width of the velocity pulse vary with epsilon .",
    "the velocity of a bead is given by eq.([cos ] ) up to the factor @xmath35 .",
    "replacing @xmath0 with @xmath62 we get : @xmath63 where @xmath64 we then write eq.([speed ] ) in an exponential form and expand its argument in a taylor series keeping the lower order term : @xmath65 the solution of eq.([eq ] ) is then approximated by a gaussian for @xmath0 close to unity . according to the properties of gaussian distributions the width @xmath66 of the solitary wave follows the scaling law @xmath67 , i.e : @xmath68 for @xmath69 we recover the result of @xcite where the width of the wave was found to diverge as time goes to infinity .",
    "we checked numerically the accuracy of this scaling relation and found a good agreement ( see fig.([width ] ) ) .",
    "a second scaling relation can be obtained by using the conservation of the kinetic energy in the wave since the beads following the wave have negligible velocities .",
    "it follows that the product @xmath70 remains constant .",
    "hence , @xmath71 we again recover the result of @xcite where the velocity amplitude was found to go to zero as time goes to infinity .",
    "we displayed in fig.([vmax ] ) the value of the final velocity amplitude @xmath42 when @xmath0 is varied in the neighborhood of one and found again a good agreement with the obtained scaling relation .",
    "these two scaling laws show that the transition between the self - similar regime @xmath69 to the solitonic regime @xmath72 is actually continuous , the value @xmath69 being not singular .",
    "after having considered the propagation of a single solitary wave in a chain of equal masses we want to present what are the consequences of the introduction of a single impurity on the stability of a shock wave .",
    "for that , we consider a chain of @xmath73 beads , the bead @xmath74 being replaced by an impurity . by impurity",
    "we mean a bead whose mass is larger or smaller than the mass of its neighbors .",
    "different behavior arises as we introduce a light or an heavy impurity . besides",
    ", we also have to take into account the value @xmath0 of the interaction law exponent .",
    "the simplest way of looking at what happens when a shock generated on the left end of the chain scatters the impurity is to compute the velocity and the displacement of the beads after the collision .",
    "fig.([vlight ] ) displays velocities for a light impurity and an exponent @xmath0 equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the leading wave corresponds to the shock wave which is followed by an increasing number of secondary solitary waves with decreasing amplitudes generated at the impurity position .",
    "a symmetric pattern arises in the opposite direction since solitary waves with negative velocities and almost same amplitudes as the previous ones propagate .",
    "the wave speed of the incident shock is modified after the collision since its amplitude decreases providing with energy the impurity which can then generate new waves .",
    "the corresponding displacement profile is displayed on fig.([ulight ] ) where the pulses are now replaced by the squared front waves characteristics of shock waves . in order to better understand the phenomenon we looked at the spatio - temporal pattern exhibited by the scattering . in fig.([spatio1 ] ) one can see black straight lines defining compression waves whereas white zones mean beads are at touching .",
    "the secondary pulses are created at the impurity position and after a transient displayed by thin curved black lines near the impurity location they propagate with a constant velocity reaching then a stationary regime .",
    "the wave speed of these pulses are decreasing as new pulses are created as one can see by looking at the slopes of the black lines .",
    "it agrees with the display of waves with decreasing amplitudes in fig.([vlight ] ) . from these observations",
    "we can conclude that the light impurity acts as a wave source . in order to understand the behavior of this source we computed the displacement of the impurity as function of time after the scattering .",
    "fig.([uimp ] ) clearly shows that the impurity oscillates around an equilibrium position .",
    "these oscillations are zig - zag shaped showing that the impurity moves with a constant velocity between two shocks with its left and right neighbors .",
    "this velocity decreases in time ( lower slopes of the oscillations ) since the impurity transfers energy to its neighbors at each shock creating new pulses .",
    "although we chose special values for the impurity mass and the interaction law exponent the same behavior is observed if we maintain the impurity mass lower than the chain masses and the interaction exponent greater than one .",
    "if we now turn to the case of an heavy impurity we observe a very different physical picture . in fig.([vheavy ] ) we displayed the velocity of the beads for an impurity mass greater than beads chain mass , the interaction exponent remaining equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the collision generates many pulses of decreasing amplitudes behind the impurity , these pulses being very close to each other . moving in the opposite direction",
    "one can see one pulse of large amplitude .",
    "this pattern is not symmetric as in the case of a light bead and a different physical process seems to be involved .",
    "we can better understand what happened by looking at the spatio - temporal pattern of contacts displayed in fig.([spatio2 ] ) .",
    "after collision the bead chain is halved as it is shown by the white vertical line separating two black areas meaning compression between beads . the impurity has actually been given a shift to the right when it collided with the shock wave .",
    "instead of bouncing back the impurity sticks and there is the formation of a compression chain .",
    "the beads following the impurity do nt remain homogeneously compressed and there is a fragmentation of the incident pulse giving raise to many pulses corresponding to the straight lines of decreasing slopes on the spatio - temporal pattern .",
    "these lines obviously correspond to pulses of decreasing amplitude in fig.([vheavy ] ) . between these pulses",
    "the beads remain at rest just touching their nearest neighbor .",
    "other compression areas appear on the left side .",
    "the straight line of larger slope is the main reflected wave .",
    "a growing compression zone moving at constant velocity follows this pulse .",
    "after some times this area also begins to fragment into new pulses as one can see from the black straight lines appearing at the front .",
    "these new compression pulses are not visible on the velocity profile since their amplitude is too low .",
    "this spatio - temporal pattern allows us to say that the collision of a shock wave with an heavy impurity make it fragment into solitary waves of decreasing amplitudes .",
    "this is not what happens when we introduce a light impurity since the shock excites the impurity . to our knowledge ,",
    "the scattering with an heavy mass is the simplest way to make the solitary wave unstable . as in the previous case , although we took @xmath75 for the impurity mass and @xmath49 for the interaction exponent the obtained pattern remains unchanged as these two parameters are tuned .",
    "+ the number of fragmented pulses actually increases with the mass of the impurity . to show it we considered a chain of equal masses with a bead of larger mass at its beginning . in the case of a bead having the same mass we know that the perturbation of the first bead by giving it a finite velocity at zero time will produce a single pulse .",
    "as we increase the mass of this first bead an increasing number of pulses appear by the same process as described previously .",
    "we plotted the corresponding velocity profiles for two different values of the first bead mass in fig.([exp1 ] ) and fig.([exp2 ] ) .",
    "+ we also looked at the energy distribution in the bead chain as function of the mass of the impurity and of the value of the force interaction exponent .",
    "fig.([er.e ] ) shows the ratio of the reflected energy at the impurity location over the total energy in the chain .",
    "the reflected energy is defined as the energy contained in the first half of the bead chain after scattering .",
    "this energy is not stationary immediately after wave reflection and we have to wait the time for it to reach a stationary value .",
    "the impurity mass varies between @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath0 takes values between @xmath53 and @xmath78 .",
    "one easily sees that the amount of reflected energy increases as the mass difference increases .",
    "this amount also increases with @xmath0 if the the impurity mass is greater than a value located between @xmath79 and @xmath80 . below this value",
    "the curves cross each others at different values of the impurity mass . below the crossing it is the lowest value of the two exponents which gives the greater amount of reflected energy .",
    "if we now consider the ratio of reflected energy over transmitted energy in fig.([er.et ] ) we observe similar variations as previously .",
    "moreover the ratios remain lower than unity meaning that the amount of reflected energy is always lower than the amount of transmitted energy in the impurity mass interval considered .",
    "we investigated the problem of a shock propagating in a non - loaded horizontal granular chain with a general beads interaction force @xmath81 , @xmath72 .",
    "we compared our numerical simulations with previous analytical results obtained in the long wavelength approximation @xcite . for values of @xmath0 close to unity",
    "we found a cross - over between a non - linearity dominated regime and a solitonic one corresponding to the long wavelength approximation .",
    "the latter regime is reached after a time which increases and tends to infinity as one tunes @xmath0 to unity .",
    "it was then shown that the transition between the @xmath69 @xcite ( self - similar ) regime to the @xmath72 regime is continuous . in the case of large values of @xmath0",
    "we observed discrepancies between numerical simulations and analytical results .",
    "as @xmath0 increases beyond @xmath48 tails in the deformation curves separate . when @xmath0 reaches the value of @xmath50 the analytical result given for the deformation curve is already not reliable . in the limit of very large values of @xmath0 the deformation curve takes a triangular shape totally inconsistent with the one given by the theoretical analysis .",
    "+ we then studied the interaction of these solitonic shock waves with an impurity mass placed in the middle of the bead chain .",
    "we first considered light impurities .",
    "the scattering of the shock with the impurity actually excites it in an oscillatory ballistic damped motion .",
    "the impurity acts as a wave source emitting solitary waves of decreasing amplitude in both directions . if we place an heavy impurity in the bead chain we observe a completely different pattern .",
    "the impurity is no more excited but sticks its next neighbor splitting the bead chain in two parts .",
    "the chain corresponding to the transmitted wave supports no more solitonic propagation and we have an instability displayed by the fragmentation of the transmitted wave into waves of decreasing amplitudes . on the other half of the chain a reflected stable solitonic wave propagates followed by a growing unstable fragmented front appearing at the impurity location .",
    "the physics involved in this case is much more complicated and deserves further investigations .",
