    "pesin s theorem @xcite prescribes the equality of the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xmath0 with the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents @xmath1 of a dynamical system , i.e. @xmath2 . the former is a rate of entropy growth that is a metric invariant of the dynamical system , while the latter is the total asymptotic expansion rate present in the chaotic dynamics .",
    "this relation provides a deep connection between equilibrium statistical mechanics and chaos . in the limiting case of vanishing lyapunov exponent , as in the onset of chaos in one - dimensional nonlinear maps ,",
    "pesin s theorem is still valid but there are important underlying circumstances that are not expressed by the trivial identity @xmath3 . at variance with the chaotic region , at the transition to chaos phase space",
    "is no longer visited in an ergodic way and trajectories within the attractor show self - similar temporal structures , they preserve memory of their previous locations and do not have the mixing property of chaotic trajectories baldovin1 , mayoral1 . for chaotic and periodic attractors",
    "the sensitivity to initial conditions converges to an exponential function for large iteration times giving rise to the familiar positive or negative lyapunov exponents associated with them . at the transition to chaos exponential separation or merging of trajectories",
    "no longer occurs , but notably the sensitivity to initial conditions does not converge to any single - valued function and , on the contrary , displays fluctuations that grow indefinitely with time . for initial positions on the attractor the sensitivity develops a universal self - similar temporal structure and its envelope grows with iteration time @xmath4 as a power law @xcite .",
    "for unimodal maps it has been shown @xcite that this rich borderline condition accepts a description via a spectrum of generalized lyapunov exponents that matches a spectrum of generalized entropy growth rates obtained from a scalar deformation of the ordinary entropy functional , the so - called tsallis entropy expression @xcite .",
    "the entropy rate also differs from the ks entropy in that it is local in iteration time .",
    "that is , the entropy rate at time @xmath5 is determined only by the positions of trajectories at this time while the ks entropy considers all previous sets of positions . here",
    "we present evidence that this general scenario of unimodal maps at the onset of chaos is captured by a special type of complex network .",
    "very recently @xcite , the horizontal visibility ( hv ) algorithm @xcite that transforms time series into networks has offered a view of chaos and its genesis in low - dimensional maps from an unusual perspective favorable for the discovery of novel features and new understanding .",
    "we focus here on networks generated by unimodal maps at their period - doubling accumulation points and characterize the fluctuations in connectivity as the network size grows .",
    "we show that the expansion of connectivity fluctuations admits the definition of a graph - theoretical lyapunov exponent .",
    "furthermore , the entropic functional that quantifies the amount of information generated by the expansion rate of trajectories in the original map appears to translate , in the light of the scaling properties of the resulting network , into a generalized entropy that surprisingly coincides with the spectrum of generalized graph - theoretical lyapunov exponents .",
    "this suggests that pesin - like identities valid at the onset of chaos could be found in complex networks that possess certain scaling properties .",
    "the rest of the letter is as follows : we first recall the hv algorithm that converts a time series into a network and focus on the so - called feigenbaum graphs @xcite as the subfamily of hv graphs generated by iterated nonlinear one - dimensional maps .",
    "we then expose the universal scale - invariant structure of the feigenbaum graphs that arise at the period - doubling accumulation points .",
    "we subsequently show how to define a graph - theoretical lyapunov exponent in this context . in agreement with the known dynamics of unimodal maps at the transition",
    "to chaos the graph - theoretical lyapunov exponent vanishes , and proceed to define generalized exponents that take into account the subexponential expansion of connectivity fluctuations .",
    "we finally show that the feigenbaum graph that represents the onset of chaos admits a spectrum of generalized graph - theoretical exponents that coincide with a spectrum of deformed entropies .",
    "the horizontal visibility ( hv ) algorithm is a general method to convert time series data into a graph @xcite and is concisely stated as follows : assign a node @xmath6 to each datum @xmath7 of the time series @xmath8 of @xmath9  real data , and then connect any pair of nodes @xmath6 , @xmath10 if their associated data fulfill the criterion @xmath7 , @xmath11 for all @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "the capability of the method as well as other variants to transfer properties of different types of time series into their resultant graphs has been demonstrated in recent works @xcite . when the series under study are the trajectories within the attractors generated by unimodal or circle maps the application of the hv algorithm yield subfamilies of visibility graphs , named feigenbaum and quasiperiodic graphs respectively , that render the known low - dimensional routes to chaos in a new setting @xcite . for illustrative purposes , in fig .",
    "[ grafos de feigenbaum1 ] we show a hierarchy of feigenbaum graphs obtained along the period - doubling bifurcation cascade of unimodal maps . at the accumulation point of the cascade",
    "the trajectories within its non - chaotic multifractal attractor become aperiodic , and in analogy with the original feigenbaum treatment feigenbaum , the associated feigenbaum graphs evidence scaling properties that can be exploited by an appropriate graph - theoretical renormalization group transformation @xcite . because the order of visits of positions of periodic attractors or of bands of chaotic attractors in unimodal maps are universal , a relevant consequence of the hv criterion is that the resulting feigenbaum graph at the onset of chaos is the same for every unimodal map .",
    "that is , it is independent of the shape and nonlinearity of the map @xcite .",
    "this permits us to concentrate our study on a specific unimodal map , that for simplicity will be the logistic map , and claim generality of the results .",
    "+        consider the logistic map @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , at the period - doubling accumulation point @xmath17 and generate a trajectory @xmath18 within the attractor . since the position of the maximum of the map @xmath19 belongs to the attractor we can choose @xmath20 as the initial condition .",
    "( the position of the maximum of the unimodal map belongs to all the superstable periodic attractors or supercycles and the accumulation point of these attractors , the attractor at the transition to chaos , contains this position @xcite ) .",
    "a sample of the corresponding time series is shown in the top panel of figure [ log_k ] , whereas in the left panel of the same figure we represent in logarithmic scales the positions of the rescaled variable @xmath21 .",
    "a similar rescaling was proposed in previous works to put in evidence the striped intertwined self - similar structure of the trajectory positions as they are visited sequentially , and reflects the multifractal structure of the attractor @xcite . in the right panel of the same figure we plot , in log - log scales , a representation of the relevant variable @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the degree of node @xmath9 in the feigenbaum graph associated to the original time series @xmath24 ( that is , @xmath25 ) .",
    "notice that the distinctive band pattern of the attractor is recovered , although in a simplified manner where the fine structure is replaced by single lines of constant degree .",
    "the hv algorithm transforms the multifractal attractor into a discrete set of connectivities , whose evolution mimics the intertwined fluctuations of the map .",
    "it is convenient to write the node index @xmath9 in the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so that running over the index @xmath10 with @xmath29 fixed selects subsequences of data or nodes placed along lines with fixed slope . for illustrative purposes , the order of visits to either the associated data or nodes in some of these subsequences",
    "are explicitly shown in both panels of figure [ log_k ] , as well as in the upper panel .",
    "notice that along these subsequences , @xmath22 increase as a power law ( i.e. subexponentially ) , and are associated to data with increasing larger values ( upper panel ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the data subsequences highlighted in the left panel , whose values @xmath30 also show a monotonic power law decay .",
    "+ from the direct observation of figure [ log_k ] it is clear that all trajectory positions within each band in the left panel ( attractor ) become nodes with the same degree in the right panel ( network ) .",
    "it is also worth noting at this point that there exists a degeneracy in the positions of trajectories that are initiated off , but close to , the attractor positions . in particular ,",
    "if an ensemble of uniformly - distributed initial positions is placed in a small interval around @xmath31 their trajectories expand while remaining uniformly - distributed at later iteration times @xcite ( see discussion below ) and the hv algorithm assigns to all of them the same feigenbaum graph",
    ". this degeneracy accounts for the universal feature that only a single feigenbaum graph represents the transition to chaos for all unimodal maps",
    ". it also determines the way in which fluctuations in trajectory separations translate into their respective degree fluctuations : see figure [ expansion ] , where we plot in logarithmic scales the distance of initially nearby trajectories for specific values of a time subsequence , and compare the expansion of this distance with the increment of the degree of the associated feigenbaum graph along the same node subsequence , as highlighted in the right panel of figure [ log_k ] .",
    "the properties of trajectory separation is thereby inherited by the graph and can be quantified through the increasing sequences of values for @xmath22 . +     close to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , measured at a precise time sequence @xmath33 ( this path is also highlighted in the left panel of figure [ log_k ] ) . along this path trajectories evidence a subexponential expansion characterized by a power law separation .",
    "note that both trajectories generate the same feigenbaum graph , whose degree increases along this concrete path in the same vein as the trajectory separation : the network inherits the properties of trajectory expansion in the hierarchy of degrees ( see right panel of figure [ log_k ] ) .",
    "a similar behavior holds for trajectory separation along other paths.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    let us focus now in the feigenbaum graph .",
    "the relabeling @xmath26 generates a one - to - one tiling of the natural numbers . the aforementioned constant degree and fixed - slope lines in the right panel of figure [ log_k ] are , respectively , @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 , @xmath10 fixed , and @xmath34 , @xmath10 @xmath36 , @xmath29 fixed ( for example , the first path highlighted in red corresponds to @xmath37 ) .",
    "the scaling property associated with the former case is that all horizontal lines with constant degree @xmath38 , @xmath10 fixed , can be overlapped into the bottom line @xmath39 , @xmath40 , via consecutive translations each consisting of a shift of @xmath41 in @xmath42 and a shift of @xmath43 in @xmath44 , that is , @xmath45 , or alternatively , @xmath46 .",
    "this scaling property has a parallel for the trajectory within the feigenbaum attractor where the shift of @xmath41 in @xmath42 is replaced by a shift of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the absolute value of the feigenbaum constant @xcite . the scaling property associated with the latter case",
    "is seen via the collapse of all fixed - slope lines of data into a single sequence of values aligned along the first @xmath49 subsequence @xmath50 , @xmath27 , when the numbers of nodes for each of the other subsequences are rescaled consecutively by @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "we recall that the standard lyapunov exponent @xmath53 accounts for the degree of exponential separation of nearby trajectories , such that two trajectories whose initial separation is @xmath54 evolve with time distancing from each other as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "the sensitivity to initial conditions is @xmath58 and the general definition of the lyapunov exponent is @xmath59deterministic fluctuations about @xmath60 are permanently put out when @xmath61 , but , as mentioned , at the period - doubling accumulation points of unimodal maps @xmath62 and trajectories display successive subexponential separation and convergence for all @xmath5 .",
    "two possible extensions of the standard lyapunov exponent have been used when @xmath62 while the amplitude of the fluctuations grows as a power law , or , equivalently , expansion and contraction rates of trajectories are logarithmic in time : mori _ et _ _ al _ @xcite suggested the expression @xmath63although this expression captures subexponential fluctuation rates , this quantity is not well defined if we want to measure the magnitude of rates _ per unit time _ ,",
    "in which case we need a quantity that grows linearly in time .",
    "this is important if we want to relate the growth of fluctuations to some kind of entropic rates that derive from an extensive entropy expression . in this respect a better - suited alternative for capturing subexponential fluctuations",
    "is to deform the logarithm in equation lyapunov1 by an amount that recovers the linear growth present for @xmath64 .",
    "this is@xmath65with @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is restored in the limit @xmath68 ) where the extent of deformation @xmath69 is such that while the expansion @xmath70 is subexponential , @xmath71 grows linearly with @xmath5 @xcite . notice that we have eliminated the @xmath72 limit in the definition of the generalized lyapunov exponents since fluctuations are present for all values of @xmath73 and the objective is to characterize them via a spectrum of generalized exponents @xcite .",
    "we define now a connectivity expansion rate for the feigenbaum graph under study .",
    "since the graph is connected by construction ( all nodes have degree @xmath74 ) , the uncertainty is only associated with a rescaled degree @xmath75 . to keep notation simple we make use of this variable and drop the subindex @xmath76 from now on .",
    "the formal network analog of the sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath70 has as a natural definition @xmath77 , as suggested from figures [ log_k ] and [ expansion ] , where we are implicitly assuming that the expansion is always compared with the minimal one @xmath78 provided by nodes at positions @xmath79 ( i.e. with @xmath80 ) .",
    "accordingly , the standard network lyapunov exponent is defined as @xmath81the value of @xmath23 oscillates with @xmath9 ( see figure [ log_k ] ) but its bounds grow slower than @xmath9 , as @xmath44 , and therefore in network context @xmath62 , in parallel to the ordinary lyapunov exponent at the onset of chaos .",
    "the logarithmic growth of the bounds of @xmath82 is readily seen by writing @xmath83 as@xmath84a first approach to study the subexponential fluctuations is to proceed _  la mori _ and define the following graph - theoretical generalized exponent @xmath85to visualize the network growth paths @xmath86 , where @xmath35 is fixed to a constant value and @xmath87 , the expression above for @xmath88 is written as@xmath89a constant @xmath90 for all @xmath10 is obtained only when @xmath49 , otherwise the same value is reached for all other @xmath29 when @xmath91 .",
    "in general , a spectrum of mori - like generalized exponents is obtained by considering all paths @xmath92 such that @xmath93 .",
    "as indicated , the preceding generalization of the lyapunov exponent is not time extensive and it is therefore not useful if we ultimately wish to relate the network link fluctuations to an entropy growth rate . with this purpose in mind",
    "we deform the ordinary logarithm in @xmath82 into @xmath94 by an amount @xmath95 such that @xmath94 depends linearly in @xmath9 , and define the associated generalized graph - theoretical lyapunov exponent as @xmath96where @xmath97 is the lapse time between an initial condition @xmath79 where @xmath29 is fixed ( see figure [ log_k ] ) , and position @xmath9 .",
    "one obtains @xmath98with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "eq . ( 8) can be corroborated via use of @xmath101 together with the identifications of the other quantities in it ( note that @xmath40 implies @xmath102 for which @xmath103 and @xmath104 is trivially undefined ) . according to eq .",
    "( 9 ) a spectrum of exponents is spanned by running over the values of @xmath29 , in parallel with the spectrum of generalized exponents previously found at the transition to chaos in unimodal maps @xcite , where the value of the parameter , @xmath99 in the feigenbaum graph is to be compared with @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 is a feigenbaum constant ) in the unimodal map for trajectories originating at the most compact region of the multifractal attractor that are seen to expand at prescribed times when the least compact region of the multifractal is visited @xcite .",
    "to complete our arguments we summon up the persistency property of trajectory distributions of unimodal maps at the period - doubling onset of chaos . that is , for a small interval of length @xmath107 with @xmath108 uniformly - distributed initial conditions around the extremum of a unimodal map ( _ e.g. _ @xmath31 for the logistic map we use ) , all trajectories behave similarly , remain uniformly - distributed at later times ,",
    "follow the concerted pattern shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "( see @xcite for details ) and expand subexponentially at prescribed time paths ( see figure [ expansion ] ) .",
    "studies of entropy growth associated with an initial distribution of positions with iteration time @xmath5 of several chaotic maps @xcite have established that a linear growth occurs during an intermediate stage in the evolution of the entropy , after an initial transient dependent on the initial distribution and before an asymptotic approach to a constant equilibrium value . at the period - doubling transition to chaos",
    "it was found @xcite that ( i ) there is no initial transient if the initial distribution is uniform and defined around a small interval of an attractor position , and ( ii ) the distribution remains uniform for an extended period of time due to the subexponential dynamics .",
    "we denote this distribution by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the number of cells that tile the initial interval @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is the total length of the interval that contain the trajectories at time @xmath5 .",
    "since iteration - time dependence transforms into node - value dependence we inquire about how @xmath113 scales along the set of nodes @xmath114 with @xmath115 links , @xmath40 , @xmath116 , @xmath41 ,  , that is , while @xmath117 is defined in the map its properties are reflected in the network .",
    "after @xmath118 iterations , the loss of information associated with the fact that the same network is generated by all of the @xmath108 initial conditions is represented in the network context by the expansion of the initial interval @xmath111 into @xmath119 after @xmath118 .",
    "therefore we find that at time @xmath118 the network scaling properties prescribe a larger number of cells to tile the new interval @xmath120 .",
    "after normalization , we find that the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath117 reads    @xmath121    that is , the uniform distributions @xmath113 for the consecutive node - connectivity pairs ( @xmath122 ) and ( @xmath123 ) scale with the same factors noticed above when discussing the right panel of figure 2 .",
    "namely , when @xmath49 these pairs can be made equal by a shift of @xmath43 in @xmath44 and a shift of @xmath41 in @xmath42 . by extension of the argument the same expression holds for all other values of @xmath29 . since @xmath124the ordinary entropy associated with @xmath113 grows logarithmically with the number of nodes @xmath9 , @xmath125 = \\log w_{j}\\sim \\log n$ ]",
    ". however , the @xmath69-deformed entropy @xmath126 = \\log _ { q}w_{j}=\\frac{1}{1-q}\\left [ w_{j}^{1-q}-1% \\right ] ,   \\label{q - entropy1}\\]]where the amount of deformation @xmath69 of the logarithm has the same value as before , grows linearly with @xmath9 , as @xmath127 can be rewritten as @xmath128 , \\label{numberw2}\\]]with @xmath99 and @xmath129 . therefore ,",
    "if we define the entropy growth rate @xmath130 \\equiv \\frac{1}{n - m}s_{q}\\left [ \\pi ( n)\\right ] \\label{entropyrate2a}\\]]we obtain @xmath130 = \\lambda _ { q } ,   \\label{entropyrate3}\\]]a pesin - like identity at the onset of chaos ( effectively one identity for each subsequence of node numbers given each by a value of @xmath35 ) .",
    "in conclusion , the transcription into a network of a special class of time series , the trajectories associated with the attractor at the period - doubling transition to chaos of unimodal maps , via the hv algorithm has proved to be a valuable enterprise @xcite as it has led to the uncovering of a new property related to the pesin identity in nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the hv method leads to a self - similar network with a structure illustrated by the related networks of periods @xmath131 , @xmath132 , shown in fig .",
    "[ grafos de feigenbaum1 ] . under the hv algorithm",
    "many nearby trajectory positions lead to the same network node and degree , all positions within one band in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ log_k ] lead to the same line of constant degree in the right panel of the figure .",
    "only when trajectory positions cross a gap between bands in the left panel the corresponding node increases its degree by two new links .",
    "also trajectories off the attractor but close to it transform into the same network structure .",
    "the degrees of the nodes span all even numbers @xmath115 , @xmath27 , and we have studied how these fluctuate as the number of nodes increases .",
    "the fluctuations of the degree capture the core behavior of the fluctuations of the sensitivity to initial conditions at the transition to chaos and they are universal for all unimodal maps .",
    "the graph - theoretical analogue of the sensitivity was identified as @xmath133 while the amplitude of the variations of @xmath42 grows logarithmically with the number of nodes @xmath9 .",
    "these deterministic fluctuations are described by a discrete spectrum of generalized graph - theoretical lyapunov exponents that appear to relate to an equivalent spectrum of generalized entropy growths , yielding a set of pesin - like identities .",
    "the definitions of these quantities involve a deformation of the ordinary logarithmic function that ensures their linear growth with the number of nodes .",
    "therefore the entropy expression involved is extensive and of the tsallis type with a precisely defined index @xmath69 .",
    "a salient feature of the application of the hv algorithm to dynamical systems time series is direct access to the degree distribution and therefore to the entropy associated with it .",
    "therefore this seems to be a good tool to discover , or , inversely , to construct , network entropy properties as studied here .",
