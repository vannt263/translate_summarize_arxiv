    "this presentation was given two days before the fermilab tevatron collider had stopped its operations . during the previous ten years , in run ii",
    ", the tevatron had delivered an integrated luminosity of 12fb@xmath1 of proton - antiproton collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96tev to the cdf and d  experiments , with peak luminosities of up to @xmath2 .",
    "this article presents an overview of recent qcd results from the cdf and the d  experiments , based on data sets with integrated luminosities of @xmath3  @xmath4fb@xmath1 .",
    "presented are measurements of inclusive isolated photon and diphoton production , vector boson plus jet production for different jet multiplicities , and event shape variables . also presented",
    "are measurement results of multijet production together with phenomenological analyses to constrain the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton and to determine the strong coupling constant , @xmath5 . in all cases ,",
    "the data are corrected for instrumental effects and are presented at the `` particle level , '' which includes all stable particles as defined in ref .",
    "the results are used to test either particle - level predictions by monte carlo events generators , or perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations in fixed order in @xmath5 which are corrected for non - perturbative effects .",
    "photon cross sections in hadron collisions receive contributions from `` prompt '' photons which directly emerge from the hard subprocess , and from photons which are produced in the fragmentation of energetic @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the latter are usually accompanied by hadrons , and their contribution can be significantly reduced by requiring the photon to be isolated from other particles in the event .",
    "isolated photon cross sections are therefore dominated by prompt photons . at lowest order , prompt photons",
    "are produced via quark - gluon compton scattering or quark - antiquark annihilation , and are therefore directly sensitive to the dynamics of the hard subprocess and to @xmath5 and the pdfs of the hadrons .",
    "furthermore , diphoton final states are also signatures for various new physics processes , such as extra spatial dimensions and for heavy new particles , such as the higgs boson , decaying into photons .",
    "photon production has been considered an ideal source of direct information on the gluon density in the proton  @xcite .",
    "however , it was observed  @xcite that not all experimental data are consistently described by pqcd calculations in fixed order of @xmath8 . on the one hand , it was argued that the existing data may not be consistent  @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that the phenomenological introduction of an intrinsic transverse momentum of the incoming partons may help improve the description of the data and reduce the inconsistencies  @xcite . but this ad - hoc procedure still had a significant model dependence and was not seen to be a fundamental solution . in recent global pdf",
    "fits photon data have been excluded  @xcite .    in order to rescue the photon data as a source of additional information on the pdfs , it is important either to identify critical missing pieces in theory or to clearly establish inconsistencies of existing data sets .",
    "precision measurements in new kinematic regions are vital for testing theory predictions .    .",

    "the @xmath10 dependence of the data / theory ratio is consistent with what was observed by d , and by previous isolated photon measurements in collider and fixed target experiments at lower energies .    to investigate the potential sources of disagreement in more detail",
    ", the d  collaboration has subsequently measured this cross section more differentially  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "also the jet ( produced in association with the photon ) was tagged , and the photon plus jet cross section was measured in four regions of the photon and jet rapidities : for central jets ( @xmath11 ) and for forward jets ( @xmath12 ) , and in each case for same side photons ( @xmath13 ) and for opposite side photons ( @xmath14 ) . again , in none of these rapidity regions could theory describe the @xmath10 dependence observed in data .    in an additional measurement  @xcite",
    ", the d  collaboration has measured the photon plus jet production cross section , this time , however , for heavy flavor jets ( separately for @xmath15- and @xmath16-jets , both at central rapidities ) . while the photon plus @xmath15-jet cross section is not described by theory , nlo pqcd theory is in good agreement with the measured photon plus @xmath16-jet cross sections .",
    "this result is consistent with a measurement of the photon plus @xmath16-jet cross section by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",

    "the pdfs are probed at small momentum fractions , where the gluon density is much larger than the quark densities .",
    "in addition to the prompt contributions , the diphoton cross section also receives contributions where one or two photons are produced in fragmentation processes .",

    "the diphoton mass distribution is described by both for masses above the peak at @xmath20gev , while both underestimate the cross section at lower masses . for the diphoton @xmath19 distribution ( not shown ) only resbos can describe the data for @xmath21gev , the region where soft gluon resummation is most important .",
    "discrepancies between data and theory are most prominent in the comparison of the measured and predicted distributions of @xmath22 , where none of the predictions can describe the whole spectrum . however , in the region @xmath23 , where soft gluon processes are expected to become relevant , the resbos prediction agrees better with the data . at smallest values",
    ", @xmath24 , corresponding to the region of smallest diphoton masses , the diphox prediction which includes the additional fragmentation contributions is closer to the data .    for a better overall description of diphoton production , it would be desirable to have a single calculation which includes all of the existing pieces , the full nlo calculations of the direct and fragmentation contributions , combined with @xmath25 @xmath26 corrections plus resummed initial - state contributions .",

    "d  jet data have been used in all recent global pdf analyses .",
    "the pdf uncertainties are therefore correlated with the experimental uncertainties in those kinematic regions in which the d  jet data had strong impact on the pdf results . as shown in figs .",
    "5153 in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is the case for the proton s gluon density at @xmath134 . since the correlations between pdf uncertainties and experimental uncertainties are not documented , the @xmath5 extraction should avoid using those data points which already had significant impact on the pdf results .    in light of the second issue , the d  @xmath5 extraction uses only data points which are insensitive to @xmath134 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xmax ] shows the cross section contributions as a function of momentum fractions @xmath83 ( here separately for @xmath135 and @xmath136 in an event ) for the inclusive jet cross section bins of the d  measurement .",
    "the ( @xmath19 , @xmath77 ) bins in the top left above the solid line have only small contributions from momentum fractions @xmath134 .",
    "since all of these data points have @xmath19 below 145gev , the first issue does not become relevant here .",
    "this leaves 22 ( out of 110 ) inclusive jet data points in the range @xmath137gev for the @xmath5 analysis .",
    "the @xmath5 extraction uses pdfs from the mstw2008 analysis  @xcite which were obtained at nnlo ( consistent with the precision of the theory calculation used here ) .",
    "these pdfs have been determined for 21 @xmath107 values between @xmath138 and @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "the continuous @xmath107 dependence of the pqcd cross sections is obtained by interpolating the cross section results for the pdf sets for different @xmath107 values .",
    "pdf uncertainties are computed using the twenty uncertainty eigenvectors ( corresponding to 68%  c.l . ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the pqcd calculation due to uncalculated higher - order contributions are estimated from the @xmath140 dependence of the calculations by varying the renormalization and factorization scales in the range @xmath141 . in a first step",
    ", data points with the same @xmath19 are combined to determine nine values of @xmath142 for @xmath137gev .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and compared to results obtained in dis . a combined determination from all 22 data points",
    "yields a result of @xmath143 this is currently the most precise result from a hadron collider , with similar precision as recent results from jet production in dis , and consistent with the current world average value  @xcite .",
    "recent d  results from a determination of the strong coupling from inclusive jet cross section data , compared to corresponding results in dis from hera . ]",
    "the cdf and d  collaborations have measured a large number of qcd related observables testing many aspects of the standard model predictions .",
    "the high integrated luminosity from the tevatron allows to explore rare processes like vector boson plus jet production for the first time in great detail .",
    "while inclusive photon and diphoton measurements are still challenging theory , other results are in general well described by existing theoretical approximations .",
    "precise measurements of jet observables have strong impact in precision phenomenology , as in constraining the proton pdfs , determinations of @xmath5 , and for excluding new physics models .",
