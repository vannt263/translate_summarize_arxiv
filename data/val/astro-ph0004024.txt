    "ultraviolet observations of the atmospheres of venus and mars , primarily from fly - by or orbiting spacecraft , but also from platforms above the terrestrial atmosphere , have played an important role in the study of the composition and structure of the  atmospheres of these planets .",
    "early spacecraft experiments were broad - band photometers that provided information about the spatial distribution of the emissions in the passband but required remote spectroscopic measurements to assure the identity of the emitting species .",
    "a thorough review of this subject is given by @xcite .",
    "once the emitting species were known , narrowband polychromators were developed and flown on missions such as _ mariner 10 _ @xcite and _ venera 11 _ and _ 12 _ @xcite , although the interpretation of the data from these instruments was far from unambiguous . with _",
    "mariners 6 , 7 _ and _ 9 _ , flown to mars in the early 1970s , and _",
    "pioneer venus orbiter _ launched to venus in 1978",
    ", ultraviolet spectrometers were included in the payloads and provided modest spectral resolution .",
    "very little additional spectroscopy , particularly from newer generations of earth - orbiting observatories such as the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , has been done and is also summarized by @xcite . in february 1990 , _ galileo _ flew by venus on its way to jupiter and the ultraviolet spectrometers on board made observations that were reported by @xcite .",
    "the flight of the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) on the astro-2 mission on the space shuttle _ endeavour _ in march 1995 provided an opportunity to measure the ultraviolet disk spectra of both venus and mars at a spectral resolution ( @xmath9  ) significantly higher than any of the prior spacecraft observations . moreover , since the first order spectral range of hut extended to wavelengths as short as 830  , the observations of venus enabled the resolution of the identity of the emissions recorded in the narrow - band photometric channels of the _ venera 11 _ and _ 12 _ euv instruments that had been interpreted in terms of analogue terrestrial spectra @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the hut disk spectra of venus and mars together with the spectral identifications and the disk - averaged brightnesses .",
    "co fluorescence in both the @xmath6 ( 0,0 ) and @xmath10 ( 0,0 ) birge - hopfield bands is identified in both venus and mars and shown to be consistent with current models of the co/  mixing ratios in the atmospheres of these planets .",
    "several other emissions are definitively identified for the first time .",
    "the hut instrument consists of a 0.9-m sic coated mirror that feeds a prime focus spectrograph with a photon - counting microchannel plate detector and photodiode array readout .",
    "details of the instrument and its performance and calibration are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph covered 820    1840   in first order with a dispersion of 0.51   per pixel .",
    "the absolute calibration , monitored several times during the mission by observations of pure hydrogen white dwarfs , is considered accurate to better than 5% at all wavelengths longward of 912   @xcite . for the observations reported here",
    ", the @xmath11 diameter spectrograph aperture was used , and was underfilled by both venus and mars .",
    "the mean spectral resolution was determined by the diameter of the planet , 151 for venus and 122 for mars , and the illuminated fraction , giving a resolution of 44.5   over the entire spectral band .    at the time of the astro-2 mission ,",
    "venus was at a solar elongation slightly inside the 45  solar avoidance constraint of hut . nevertheless ,",
    "since the performance of hut and the supporting instrument pointing system was nominal after ten days of the mission , it was decided to attempt to observe venus at a solar elongation of 402 .",
    "this observation occurred at ut 05:25 on 13 march 1995 and produced no adverse heating of the telescope assembly nor appreciably elevated scattered light .",
    "a second observation was made about 9 hours later .",
    "both observations were made during orbit day .",
    "a spectrum of venus from the first observation is shown in figure  [ spectv1 ] .",
    "it includes not only the desired disk spectrum of venus but also contributions from the terrestrial day airglow .",
    "the earth s dayglow includes  lyman-@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath12 , as well as emissions of atomic and ionic oxygen and atomic nitrogen that are also present in the dayglow of venus .",
    "fortuitously , it took longer to acquire and lock onto venus during the second observation so there are @xmath0500 seconds of background data taken during this observation that correspond to approximately the same viewing geometry ( with respect to the earth s atmosphere ) as when venus was in the aperture during the first observation .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ time ] , which shows the count rates for two of the brighter emissions ,  1304 and  1200 , as a function of time for both observations .",
    "figure  [ spectv2 ] shows two 516 second integrations , venus + earth and earth alone .",
    "the difference spectrum is then the true spectrum of venus , and this spectrum is used to derive the disk brightnesses for the , , and  emissions listed in table  [ tab1 ] . for the other emissions ,",
    "the longer exposure spectrum of figure  [ spectv1 ] is used .",
    "the error bars given in table  [ tab1 ] are 1-@xmath13 statistical uncertainties in the observed counts within a given emission feature .",
    "mars was observed during orbit night beginning at ut 22:33 on 12 march 1995 .",
    "the hut spectrum of mars is shown in figure  [ spectm ] , and the derived disk brightnesses are also listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the hut observations of venus and mars represent the highest quality spectra , in terms of both spectral resolution and instrument sensitivity , obtained to date for the ultraviolet below 1800  .",
    "the present discussion will focus on the identification of spectral features and comparison with previous observations .",
    "future work will concern the modelling of these spectra in terms of current atmospheric models based on _ in situ _ measurements made over the past two decades @xcite .      below 2000  ,",
    "the ultraviolet dayglow of venus and mars is dominated by emissions of carbon monoxide and carbon @xcite . from both fig .",
    "[ spectv1 ] and fig .",
    "[ spectm ] we see that a large number of individual bands of the co fourth positive ( @xmath1   @xmath2 ) system are clearly identified . when compared with calculated optically thin fluorescence efficiencies ( `` g - factors '' ) for this system @xcite , the effect of the twenty - fold increase in the mean  absorption cross - section from 1700 to 1500   @xcite",
    "is clearly seen in the enhancement of the weaker longer wavelength bands .",
    "in addition , the co is optically thick in that the expected strong ( @xmath14 ) bands are particularly weak implying that photons are being pumped out of these bands into other members of the ( @xmath15 ) progression by repeated absorption and re - emission .",
    "bands of the ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 ) progressions , pumped by solar  and  1304 , respectively @xcite , are clearly seen , particularly the ( 14,3 ) band at 1316   and the ( 9,2 ) band at 1378  , both of which are free of blending by other co bands or atomic emissions .",
    "the strong emission feature at @xmath18   is a blend of  1356 and the co ( 14,4 ) band at 1352  , the strongest in the solar  pumped progression , with most of the observed emission due to co.    other observed features include the co hopfield - birge bands , @xmath3  ",
    "@xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1151   and @xmath4  ",
    "@xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1088  , which are identified for the first time in the spectra of venus and mars .",
    "they appear to be present in the _ galileo _ euv spectrum of venus @xcite , but can not be positively identified at the 30   resolution of that instrument .",
    "the @xmath6 band is blended with emission from  1152 . at first sight ,",
    "the relative intensities of these bands and the similarity with low energy electron impact laboratory spectra @xcite , suggest that excitation of co by photoelectrons is a major source of the emission .",
    "however , as is shown in section 3.2 , it is possible to account for the observed brightness of the @xmath19 ( 0,0 ) band solely on the basis of resonance fluorescence of solar ultraviolet radiation .",
    "no other bands of either of these systems is detected , as expected from the strongly diagonal nature of both band systems and the high pre - dissociation fractions for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "there is also a weak indication of the @xmath5  ",
    "@xmath2  ( 0,0 ) band at 1076   in the spectrum of venus .",
    "in addition to the principal  multiplets at 1561 and 1657  , a number of other atomic carbon lines are identified in fig .",
    "[ spectv1 ] .",
    "some of these , the multiplets at 1329 , 1280 , 1277 and 1261  , were identified in the _ mariner 6 _ and _ 7 _ spectra of the upper atmosphere of mars @xcite .",
    "in addition , we identify emission from  1335 , blended with the ( 9,1 ) co fourth positive band at 1339  , indicating the presence of c@xmath21 in the ionospheres of venus and mars .",
    "it is interesting to compare the ratio of these emissions between venus and mars . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] we find that for all of the co bands and the atomic carbon emissions this ratio is @xmath22 , whereas the ratio of solar flux is 5.3 .",
    "this had been previously noted by @xcite , and reflects the lower co to  mixing ratio on mars compared to that on venus .",
    "emissions from co shortward of lyman-@xmath7 appear in the form of the hopfield - birge bands @xmath4  ",
    "@xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1088   and @xmath3  ",
    "@xmath2  ( 0,0 ) at 1151  .",
    "the @xmath6 band is blended with emission from @xmath231152 .",
    "the intensities of these bands are not consistent with optically thin emission .",
    "since no other bands of these systems were detected a scenario of resonant scattering was assumed .",
    "the band is scattered from a column of co defined by the optical thickness due to pure absorption by co@xmath24 : @xmath25 and computed using the number densities of the venus international reference atmosphere ( vira ) model @xcite and the model of @xcite for mars , with co@xmath24 absorption coefficients taken from @xcite .    to test the applicability of these atmospheric profiles to modeling the co emission ,",
    "we compared the column density derived from the ( 14,3 ) band at 1316   of the fourth positive system ( @xmath1   @xmath2 ) and that derived using the above relationship .",
    "the brightness of the ( 14,3 ) band ( in rayleighs ) in the optically thin limit is @xmath26 and measured to be @xmath27 r in the venus spectrum .",
    "the g - factor for  absorption in the ( 14,0 ) band was evaluated using the oscillator strength recommended by @xcite , @xmath28 , based on their recent work and the work of @xcite and @xcite , together with the solar  line profile from @xcite normalized to uars / solstice measurements of the solar  flux @xcite made at the time of the _",
    "astro-2 _ mission .",
    "branching ratios were taken from @xcite .",
    "we thus derive a co column density of @xmath29 @xmath30 , whereas the vira model predicts a column of @xmath31 @xmath30 .",
    "the close agreement , considering the uncertainty in all of the parameters involved in the g - factor calculation , supports our use of these model atmospheres .    following the treatment of @xcite , a theoretical curve - of - growth",
    "was calculated using the rates of emission from the excited electronic state of each rovibrational transition to determine the expected omnidirectional brightness , @xmath32 , in rayleighs .",
    "the equivalent width ( @xmath33 ) of the band is then defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the incident solar flux determined from hut observations of the moon and the lunar albedo as given by @xcite . to compute the curve - of - growth",
    ", we used a density weighted temperature average to characterize both the kinetic and rotational temperatures . including transitions through rotational quantum number @xmath36 , we produced curves - of - growth for both venusian and martian @xmath37 ( 0,0 ) emissions as shown in figure  [ cog ] .",
    "the curves appear as bands with the upper edge corresponding to an oscillator strength of @xmath38 @xcite as recommended by @xcite , and the lower to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the emissions appear to be consistent with resonant scattering from the upper atmospheres of both planets . as with the @xmath40 bands ,",
    "the observed ratio of the emissions between venus and mars is @xmath41 , whereas the ratio of the solar flux is 5.3 .",
    "this difference reflects the lower co mixing ratio on mars as well as a reduced thermospheric temperature at @xmath42 .",
    "curves of growth for @xmath43 ( 0,0 ) ( @xmath44 , @xcite ) were determined in the same manner as for @xmath37 ( 0,0 ) and the equivalent width corresponding to the appropriate column density was used to calculate an expected @xmath45 and @xmath46 r of emission from venus and mars respectively . subtracting these from the total observed emission results in @xmath231152 emission of about @xmath47 r for venus and @xmath48 r for mars ,",
    "most likely due to direct electron impact excitation of atomic oxygen .",
    "argon emission at 1048 and 1066   is detected only in the spectrum of mars ( fig .",
    "[ spectm ] ) .",
    "the upper limits for venus are consistent with the known argon mixing ratio of @xmath49 ppm .",
    "note that  1066 appears brighter than  1048 , even though the fluorescence efficiency of the 1048   line is 3.5 times higher than that of the 1066   line .",
    "this is the result of the higher  absorption cross - section at 1048  . using the approach of @xcite",
    ", we find an argon mixing ratio of 0.016 and 0.021 , from the brightness of the 1048 and 1066   lines , respectively .",
    "considering the uncertainties in both the data and the fluorescence efficiencies , this result is in good agreement with the known value of 0.016 for mars @xcite .",
    "the  multiplets near 867   are not detected on either mars or venus .",
    "figure  [ spectv2 ] also shows the presence of  584 in second order at 1168   in the spectrum of venus .",
    "the second order effective area of hut was only @xmath50 @xmath51 , compared to the peak first order effective area of 25 @xmath51 near 1150   @xcite , so that the derived brightness has a large statistical uncertainty , @xmath52 r. nevertheless , this result is consistent with prior measurements of  emission from _ venera _ and _",
    "galileo_.      shortward of lyman-@xmath7 , other emission features detected include  834 ,  989 ,  lyman-@xmath8 , and  1134 and 1200 .",
    "the atomic nitrogen features are identified for the first time , although , as above ,  1134 appears to be present in the _ galileo _ euv spectrum of venus .",
    "the disk brightnesses for both venus and mars are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "while there are many weak features present in the spectrum of venus between 840 and 1000  , most of these are of terrestrial origin , primarily of atomic and singly ionized nitrogen , and the contributions from venus are at least an order of magnitude lower than those reported by @xcite from a sounding rocket observation .      table  [ tab2 ] gives a comparison of the hut measurements of the disk of venus with those reported from _",
    "venera 11 _ and _ 12 _ @xcite and , more recently , _",
    "the _ galileo _ flyby of venus was in february 1990 , during solar maximum , while the hut observations in march 1995 were at a time approaching solar minimum .",
    "this is reflected in the roughly factor of two difference between the two sets of data , which must be considered excellent agreement .",
    "venera 11/12 _ measurements were made in december 1978 , also approaching solar maximum .",
    "thus , a similar argument accounts for the difference in  and  brightnesses between hut and _ venera_. however , it appears that the _ venera _ channels at wavelengths longward of 1500   were severely contaminated by scattered light .",
    "we have obtained far - ultraviolet spectra of venus and mars in the range 820    1840    at @xmath04   resolution with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) during the _ astro-2 _ mission in march 1995 .",
    "the spectra of both planets are rich in co band emission , some of the systems being identified for the first time , together with strong  and  multiplets .",
    "resonance fluorescence is identified as the dominant source of the co emission .",
    "atomic nitrogen emissions are also identified in the spectrum of venus , while the  doublet is seen only in the spectrum of mars .",
    "these spectra , obtained at higher spectral resolution than was possible from earlier fly - by and orbiting missions to these planets , elucidates and extends the earlier spectroscopic measurements and should provide guidance in the interpretation of the far - ultraviolet spectra obtained during the recent _ cassini _ fly - by of venus @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the spacelab operations support group at marshall space flight center for their support during the _ astro-2 _ mission .",
    "we also thank our many colleagues at the johns hopkins university and the applied physics laboratory for their contributions to the success of the hopkins ultraviolet telescope .",
