    "one of the major puzzles in particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is to understand the origin of neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "a simple paradigm is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite which introduces three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos with arbitrary majorana masses additionally to the sm with the resulting seesaw formula for the light neutrino mass matrix given by : @xmath3 the input values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are then required to find the neutrino masses .",
    "in the simple seesaw framework , the rh neutrino spectrum can therefore not be determined from neutrino observations .",
    "clearly , the knowledge of the right handed neutrino spectrum would be of great phenomenological interest for testing the model .",
    "if seesaw is embedded into grand unified theories it is sometimes possible to predict @xmath4 , so that one could get some idea about the right handed neutrino masses . in this paper",
    ", we present a bottom - up one loop scheme where we obtain the following seesaw - like formula from a left - right symmetric model even though the dirac mass matrix vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the diagonal charged lepton mass matrix : @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a higgs self coupling . as a result ,",
    "the flavor structure of the rh neutrino mass matrix is completely determined .",
    "we find a stronger hierarchy in the rh neutrino sector compared to the charged leptons .",
    "thus the radiative corrections transmit the charged lepton mass hierarchy into the rh neutrino sector ( _ radiative transmission of hierarchies _ ) .",
    "furthermore the hierarchy in the rh sector is such that it is easily obtainable from a simple @xmath0 family assignment .",
    "this is the main result of the paper . as an application ,",
    "we predict @xmath10 in this model .",
    "we also discuss how the quark sector can be made realistic since the @xmath1 symmetry leads to vanishing down quark masses at tree level .",
    "two ways to generate realistic down quark masses and ckm angles are : ( i ) introduction of color triplet iso - spin singlet fields that give radiative masses to down quarks or ( ii ) the addition of three iso - spin singlet vector - like down quarks which generate a tree level mass for the down quarks .",
    "we only present the second scenario here , which also has the property that it leads to an inert doublet type scalar dark matter .",
    "our model is based on the left - right ( lr ) symmetric group  @xcite @xmath11 supplemented by a discrete symmetry group @xmath1 .",
    "the quarks and leptons are assigned as in the minimal lr model to left - right symmetric doublets .",
    "the symmetry breaking is implemented also as in the minimal lr model by the higgs fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in the leptonic sector of the model",
    ", the @xmath14 breaking by the right handed triplet with @xmath15 gives large majorana masses to the rh neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "unlike in the usual implementation of the seesaw formula however , in our model , the dirac mass for neutrinos vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory due to the @xmath1 symmetry , whose effect on the various fields is given in the table below :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as noted , at tree level , both neutrino dirac masses and the down quark masses vanish .",
    "we will address the question of down quark masses in the next section .",
    "as far as neutrinos are concerned , at one loop level they pick up mass from the left diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : numass_lfv ] with the neutrino mass matrix given by the one loop formula @xmath16 where @xmath17 is given by @xmath18.\\ ] ] the higgs masses are given by @xmath19 note that these couplings @xmath20 are the effective couplings which we get at low energies when the left - right symmetry is broken .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath23 in the ma - model  @xcite .",
    "then , the light neutrino mass matrix can then be written as @xmath24 note that we can absorb @xmath25 into @xmath26 without loss of generality .",
    "since we have a rough idea about the form of the neutrino mass matrix in the limit of zero cp phase and small reactor angle @xmath27 , we can use it to get an idea about the elements of the rh neutrino mass matrix .",
    "it is interesting that all elements of this mass matrix can be determined .",
    "the neutrino mixing observables  @xcite we use are : @xmath28 the charged lepton masses we take from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath29    to fit the neutrino oscillation data , we can use @xmath30 where the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath31 gev .",
    "note that , in order to avoid the @xmath32 detection in the @xmath33-boson decay width , @xmath9 has to be larger than @xmath34 .",
    "the neutrino masses are given by @xmath35      to fit the neutrino oscillation data , we can use @xmath36 where the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath37 gev , where @xmath9 now has to be larger than @xmath38 .",
    "the neutrino masses are @xmath39    note that in both cases , there is a strong hierarchy in the rh neutrino sector in a way similar to the charged lepton sector .",
    "this is what we label as the _ radiative transmission of hierarchy _ from charged leptons to the rh neutrinos .",
    "note that this mechanism , given a certain form of @xmath40 ( with small mixings ) , naturally allows for large mixing angles in the sm lepton sector , that are not necessarily maximal .",
    "this is different from many other models , where in most cases only zero or maximal mixing is predicted .",
    "note however , that there are also exceptions to this : e.g. , the size of the mixing angle could be determined by underlying discrete symmetries  @xcite , or it could arise from an anarchical pattern of the neutrino mass matrix  @xcite .    to see analytically why this happens ,",
    "let us try to reconstruct @xmath40 from the tri - bimaximal form for the pmns - matrix  @xcite , @xmath41 using this and eq .  , we can write down @xmath40 as function of @xmath9 and of the light neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath42 .",
    "it is given by @xmath43 times @xmath44 if we assume normal ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , with small @xmath48 ) or inverted hierarchy ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ) , the corresponding matrices will roughly look like @xmath52 and @xmath53 note that the reconstruction of all matrices ( eqs .  , and  ) has led us to heavy neutrino mass matrices which are hierarchical and stiff . in all cases , having a light neutrino mass close to zero ( @xmath54 in eqs .   and  )",
    "can only increase this hierarchy , but not destroy it . especially in eq .",
    "the 11-entry is fixed , which means that we will generically have one fixed rh neutrino mass that is not too heavy .",
    "a similar situation happens for the quasi - degenerate case .",
    "these mass matrices for rh neutrinos have a structure that is easily obtainable from the froggat - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism  @xcite with a @xmath0 family symmetry with @xmath55 charges @xmath56 for the third , second , and the first generation right handed lepton doublets .",
    "the left - right and @xmath0 invariant yukawa couplings in this case can be written as : @xmath57.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an appropriate choice of @xmath58 ( roughly @xmath59 in the normal hierarchy case ) , we get the desired hierarchy in both the charged lepton masses as well as in the rh neutrino sector .",
    "this hierarchy then translates into a structure of the light neutrino mass matrix that naturally yields large mixing angles , although no values are excluded a priori .    we can also give a prediction for @xmath60  @xcite , which is transmitted by the heavy neutrinos ( cf .",
    "right diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : numass_lfv ] ) : the yukawa coupling in the basis where the heavy neutrino mass matrix is diagonal is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath40 . for a charged higgs mass of 100  gev and @xmath63 ,",
    "the prediction for @xmath64 is @xmath65 for normal and @xmath66 for inverted ordering , where we have used eqs .   and  .",
    "if we go to smaller values for @xmath9 , the branching ratio increases ( @xmath67 for @xmath68 and normal ordering ) , which might be very interesting in light of the upcoming meg experiment  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( 4 ) that at the tree level in our model , only the up quarks are massive .",
    "we present two ways to make the quark sector realistic by giving mass to the down quarks , ( i ) one where the @xmath69 symmetry , that keeps dirac mass of the neutrino to be zero , is softly broken and ( ii ) another one by adding three vector - like down quarks , where we can keep the @xmath69 symmetry exact .",
    "we only discuss the second option here .    for ( ii ) , we extend the model by adding three @xmath70 singlet , color triplet , @xmath71 quarks ( denoted by @xmath72 ) and two higgs doublets under the @xmath70 groups with @xmath73 ( denoted by @xmath74 ) . under the @xmath1 symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath74 and @xmath75 are invariant , whereas @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to write down a potential for @xmath74 with asymmetric mass terms for them so that they have nonzero vevs .",
    "since the discrete symmetry does not allow the term @xmath77 term in the potential , the additional fields do not destabilize the @xmath78 vev pattern assumed in the bulk of the paper .",
    "the new yukawa interaction that is invariant under @xmath1 and gauge symmetry is given by @xmath79 after spontaneous symmetry breaking the down quarks now have masses where they pair with the new down quarks ( rather than the usual ones of the sm ) .",
    "as a result , the @xmath80 partner of the up quark is a heavy down quark unlike in the minimal left - right model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , after symmetry breaking , one could write the left and right doublets as follows : @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath75 and @xmath83 swap roles ) , where the mass of @xmath84 is in the 10 to 100 tev range .",
    "we emphasize that there is no direct mass term between @xmath85 and @xmath75 .",
    "to fit the down quark masses and the ckm matrix , the yukawa coupling need to be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the vev of @xmath88 .",
    "this appears to be a completely viable way to generate down quark masses .",
    "an interesting feature of this model is that the surviving @xmath69 remains an exact symmetry , and as result the neutral member of the second doublet in @xmath78 can act as dark matter  @xcite , since it couples to quarks as @xmath89 , and as long as @xmath90 , the @xmath91 is stable with stability guaranteed by the @xmath69 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a radiative one loop model for neutrino masses proposed in  @xcite arises as a low energy limit of a left - right model which then provides a natural explanation of the two elements of the  @xcite proposal : ( a ) the reason for the extra doublet with its particular discrete symmetry property and ( b ) the origin of the right handed neutrino mass . furthermore , the radiative transmission of hierarchies makes large but non - maximal mixing angles in the leptonic sector plausible .",
    "left - right embedding also reduces the number of parameters in the model , making it predictive in the hadronic and leptonic flavor sectors .",
