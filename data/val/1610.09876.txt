    "the analysis of interaction between two objects when placed close together ( smaller than wavelength of light ) has led to the observation of new and interesting phenomena like near - field radiative heat transfer where the radiative transfer between the objects exceeds planck s blackbody limit by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the theoretical description and experimental confirmation of this phenomenon has given rise to new applications like thermal radiation scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , near - field thermophotovoltaics @xcite , and non - contact radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "recently it has been recognized that radiative ( mediated by photons ) exchange can not be the only mode of near - field heat exchange between two closely spaced bodies . in an experimental study @xcite to understand the thermal coupling between a scanning tunneling microscope tip and a gold substrate , for a spacing of @xmath0 0.3 nm vacuum gap , a heat flux six orders of magnitude larger than predictions of near - field radiation theory was observed . in this paper",
    "we describe the possibility of an additional channel of heat transfer due to phonon transmission across vacuum gap . since it can be shown that the number of _ propagating _ modes available for heat transfer via phonons is approximately @xmath1 times greater than that available for photons , where @xmath2 [ @xmath3 is the speed of light [ sound ] in vacuum [ solid ] , and since the velocity of sound in most solids is of the order of @xmath4 m@xmath5 , if a mechanism can exist where these phonons can transmit across the vacuum gap , it can be expected to be a significant source of heat transfer between two objects separated by vacuum . such a mode of transmission of phonons across a vacuum gap is far from obvious since phonons , being the quanta of lattice vibrations , require a material medium to propagate .",
    "the basic premise of this work is that when two bodies are brought in close proximity to each other in vacuum , the van der waals interaction between them can act as a conduit for the phonons to propagate across the vacuum gap .",
    "while this van der waals interaction is weak compared to the inter - atomic bonds that exist in a solid , the sheer number of propagating modes available for heat exchange via phonons compared to photons could make this mechanism a significant source of heat transfer .",
    "along with the propagating modes , modes which are trapped on the surface of the objects can also contribute to heat transfer , as is observed in the photon exchange process .",
    "there have been a few recent attempts to estimate the heat transport via phonon transport across vacuum gap .",
    "sellan et .",
    "@xcite observed that the heat transfer via phonons can be four orders of magnitude higher than that via near - field radiative transfer for a gap of 1 @xmath6 between two silicon surfaces .",
    "however this lattice - dynamics based simulation took into account only the interactions of the surface atoms via their electron clouds and not the relatively long - range van der waals interaction between objects for the phonon transmission .",
    "prunnila and meltaus @xcite predicted significant phonon transmission when closely spaced mediums are made up of piezoelectric material .",
    "this effect is due to the electric field induced by the phonons in the material acting as a conduit for the phonon transmission .",
    "the fact that van der waals forces can act also as a conduit for phonon exchange , and hence heat transfer , across the vacuum gap has been recognized in two recent works @xcite .",
    "however due to inconsistencies in these works we believe that the correct picture of phonon transmission across the vacuum gap has not yet been captured .",
    "ezzhahri et .",
    "al . , observed that for highly doped silicon it is possible for phonon mediated heat transfer to dominate the radiative transfer .",
    "but they consider only ballistic transport of phonons across the gap and do not elucidate on the role of different modes of elastic waves that can exist in a solid like compressional , transverse and surface waves .",
    "moreover , the phonon transmission is calculated by modeling the interaction of atoms across the vacuum gap to be spring - like , which is strictly valid only at very small gaps @xmath7 where repulsive forces due to overlapping electron clouds start to become significant .",
    "budaev and bogy do not assume spring - like interaction , but consider only compressional elastic waves in their study and ignore other possible modes ; no numerical data has been presented regarding how dominant the heat exchange via phonons is vis -  - vis radiative transfer at small gaps .",
    "a more recent work by chiloyan et .",
    "@xcite follows the method adopted by ezzhahri et .",
    "of modeling the coulombic interaction of atoms across the vacuum gap with a spring - like behavior to calculate phonon transmission , and show that for subnanometer gaps the contribution from low frequency acoustic phonons can be significant .",
    "a common drawback in these works is the non - consideration of sinusoidal variation of the surface topology of the solids due to the presence of phonons .     and",

    "we adopt the theory of estimating the thermal boundary resistance ( or the kaptiza resistance ) at an interface between two media and extend it to our configuration of two bodies separated by a vacuum gap . a study of heat transfer across an interface between two media such as that shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) is of critical importance in systems where high heat dissipation is crucial ( for example : in semiconductor devices ) .",
    "hence , such a system has been studied in extensive detail and models have been developed to estimate heat transfer across such an interface ; one such model is the acoustic mismatch method @xcite .",
    "the methodology developed is as follows : phonons are modeled as propagating elastic waves and the two possible polarizations modes , longitudinal and transverse , are assumed to undergo specular reflection and transmission at the interface .",
    "since each polarization mode can give rise to a combination of modes at the interface there are four unknowns to be solved for ( two reflection and two transmission coefficients ) and these are determined using the stress and displacement boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "the transmission coefficients thus obtained determine the amount of heat that gets transmitted across the interface .",
    "importantly , the heat transfer coefficient across an interface predicted from this method has been experimentally verified to hold true for well prepared interfaces and for a wide range of temperatures @xcite . while extending this procedure to calculate the heat transfer for our configuration shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) of closely spaced bodies separated by vacuum and at different temperatures , we employ boundary conditions that are different from that adopted in the acoustic mismatch method ( due to the presence of vacuum gap and the normal van der waals force at the surface of the solids ) .",
    "an important and novel aspect of our work is to take into account the modulation of the surface of the solids due to the presence of the collective atomic vibrations ( phonons ) and the resulting effect on the interaction between the surfaces .",
    "the surface of the hot body with phonons ( medium 1 in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) will have a sinusoidal variation with spatial frequency equal to the parallel component of the wave - vector of the phonons .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the van der waals force satisfies additive principle , this sinusoidal variation on the surface will be analytically shown to impose an exponential limit on the number of wave - vectors which contribute to interaction between the surfaces .",
    "prior works have failed to recognize this effect so that the heat transfer contributions from the higher wave - vector modes would be over - estimated .",
    "since we ignore phonon - phonon interactions and work in the continuum limit the method proposed here is valid for temperatures that are small compared to the debye temperature where only low frequency acoustic phonons are activated .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "3 a general expression for the van der waals force is derived for an arbitrary sinusoidal displacement of the surface . in sec .",
    "4 , an expression for the amplitude of the sinusoidal displacement at the surface of a planar object is derived as a function of incident angle and the polarization of the incident elastic wave , which , when used in the result from sec .",
    "3 gives the value of the force acting on the surface of the planar object .",
    "this force is then related to the stress in the media and expressions for transmission coefficients of the phonons as a function of incident angle are derived from the boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "5 , expression for the heat transfer is derived and numerical values of heat transfer for objects made of materials commonly used in the micro electromechanical industry are compared .",
    "region b(c ) comprises the section of medium 1(2 ) where the x - coordinate varies from @xmath10 to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the amplitude of the sinusoidal displacement on the surface ]    we consider one of the bodies , say medium 1 , to be held at a finite temperature @xmath13 and the other at 0 k so that the effect of phonons in lattice deformation is prevalent only in medium 1 . to find the time - varying van der waals force acting on the surface of medium 2 , we consider a test displacement on its surface and calculate the total van der waals potential of the resulting configuration .",
    "the total potential between the two media can be divided into bulk - bulk ( interaction between region a and region d in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , bulk - surface ( interaction between region a and region c , and between region b and region d in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and surface - surface ( interaction between region b and region c ) contributions .",
    "since the bulk - bulk interaction potential is time - invariant it does not contribute to phonon transmission , and only the bulk - surface and the surface - surface interaction will be considered separately below .",
    "consider first the region b - region c interaction potential @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 is the number density of molecules in the two media , then the number of atoms in an elementary volume @xmath16 of material is @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the dispersion constant accounting for interaction between two atoms in the opposite mediums .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the potential satisfies additivity principle , @xmath14 can be got by accounting for the pair - wise interaction between atoms in the two sinusoidal displacements on the surface of the two media and , in the limit @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is given by :    @xmath21^{3}}d^{2}{\\bf r_{||}}d^{2}\\mathbf{r_{|| } } \\label{eq : langle}\\ ] ]    where , the factor @xmath22 is introduced noting that integration would involve counting the pair - wise interaction twice ; the displacement at the surface of the two media are given by : @xmath23 ; and @xmath24 .",
    "the dispersion constant @xmath18 can be related to the experimentally determined and catalogued hamaker s constant h using @xcite :    @xmath25 since the integral @xmath26 evaluates to @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the 2nd order bessel function of the second kind , eq .",
    "[ eq : langle ] thus reduces to the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the area of interaction between the two surfaces .",

    "the normal van der waals force acting on the surface ( per unit area of interaction ) of medium 1 and medium 2 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , can be got from the interaction potential as : @xmath42 the presence of the factor @xmath43 imposes a limit on the contribution of large wave - vector modes to the interaction between the two surfaces , particularly for large gaps .",
    "this can be seen from the asymptotic approximation for the function @xmath43 @xcite , where , in the limit @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "due to this exponential cut - off in the large wave - vector modes , the heat transfer falls off at a higher rate than that calculated previously in ref .",
    "@xcite where this effect has been ignored . as observed in eq .",
    "[ eq : force ] the expressions for the normal van der waals forces is linear in the displacement amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath46 . the shear - force between the two surfaces can be obtained by considering the sinusoidal distortion to have a phase difference @xmath47 and differentiating with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "a similar method has been adopted in ref .",
    "this gives the expression for the shear force to be quadratic in the displacement amplitudes , and since we are in the limit of small amplitudes , it can be neglected in relation to the normal van der waals force .",
    "as mentioned in sec . 1 , to find the heat transmitted to the second medium due to the van der waals interaction between the surfaces , we take the continuum limit where phonons can be modeled as elastic waves .",
    "to relate the expressions of the van der waals force found in sec . 1 to the stress in the medium ( taken to be isotropic ) we look at the displacements in the medium in the presence of elastic waves .",
    "while it is possible to have three different polarizations modes - one longitudinal and two transverse ( polarized in the horizontal and vertical planes , also referred to as sh and sv waves respectively ) , since the transverse mode polarized in the horizontal plane ( sh mode ) does not result in out - of - plane deformation it does not contribute to phonon transmission , and we only consider the sv mode henceforth .",
    "consider first an incident planar longitudinal wave of unit amplitude in medium 1 as shown in fig .",
    "the equation of the incident wave is of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a unit vector in the direction of propagation of the incident wave and can thus be expressed in terms of the incident angle @xmath50 as @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the components of the wave - vector perpendicular and parallel to the surface respectively .",
    "the displacement vector of the two reflected waves can be written as : @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is the reflection coefficient of the longitudinal ( transverse ) component ; and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is a unit vector in the direction of propagation of the reflected longitudinal ( transverse ) wave .",
