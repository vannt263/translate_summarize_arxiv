    "a challenging subject in the study of dynamical patterns in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is the investigation of matter - wave solitons in multidimensional settings .",
    "various routes leading to the creation of stable 2d and 3d solitons have been elaborated theoretically .",
    "the proposed approaches have much in common with their counterparts developed for the stabilization of 2d and 3d spatiotemporal solitons in nonlinear optics , see review @xcite .",
    "however , thus far , only effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) matter - wave solitons have been created in experiments which used cigar - shaped traps to confine the condensate @xcite ( the actual shape of the soliton may be nearly three - dimensional , but it is intrinsically self - trapped only in the longitudinal direction ) . a phenomenon which impedes",
    "the stabilization of truly multidimensional solitons is the occurrence of collapse in 2d and 3d condensates with attraction between atoms . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , a universal method for the stabilization of matter - wave solitons in the multidimensional setting may be provided by optical lattices ( ols ) , i.e. , periodic potentials which are induced , through interference patterns , by coherent laser beams illuminating the condensate in opposite directions ( in principle , similar methods may be applied to a gas of polaritons , where an evidence of the bec state was recently reported too @xcite ) .",
    "the stabilization of 2d and 3d solitons is possible with the help of the fully - dimensional ol , whose dimension is equal to that of the entire space , and by low - dimensional lattices , whose dimension is smaller by one .",
    "the latter means quasi-1d and quasi-2d ols in the 2d and 3d space , respectively @xcite .",
    "ols may also support solitons of a completely different type , namely , _",
    "gap solitons _ in bec ( of any dimension ) with repulsion between atoms . in this case , the solitons emerge due to the interplay between the repulsive nonlinearity and the negative effective mass in parts of the linear bandgap spectrum generated by the ol @xcite . although gap solitons can not represent the ground state of the respective system , they are dynamically stable objects @xcite .",
    "the creation of effectively 1d gap solitons , composed of @xmath3 atoms of @xmath4rb , was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also review @xcite .",
    "multidimensional ( chiefly , 2d ) gap solitons @xcite , and  semi - gap \" solitons ( which look like gap solitons in one direction , and regular solitons in the other @xcite ) were predicted too @xcite , but not yet observed in the experiment .",
    "stable gap solitons , in 1d and 2d settings alike , can be supported not only by periodic ols , but also by quasi - periodic ones @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to note that the presence of the lattice , defining a particular spatial scale in the system ( the ol period ) , introduces an effective nonlocality . on the other hand ,",
    "a nonlocality can be directly induced by long - range interactions between atoms carrying dipolar moments . in this way",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the interplay between the local repulsion and long - range attraction may also support stable 2d solitons , both isotropic @xcite and anisotropic ddaniso ones .",
    "another theoretically elaborated stabilization technique relies on periodic time modulation of the effective nonlinearity coefficient , which may be provided by the feshbach - resonance effect in a low - frequency ac magnetic field applied to the condensate .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this method can stabilize 2d fundamental solitons , but not 3d ones @xcite ( the stabilization of 3d solitons and their bound complexes is possible under a combined action of this technique and a quasi-1d ol @xcite ; the application of the feshbach - resonance technique to matter waves trapped in usual ols @xcite , as well as in parabolic traps @xcite , was studied too ) .",
    "this approach to the creation of stable 2d matter - wave solitons followed the earlier elaborated mechanism providing for the stabilization of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional optical spatial solitons in the model of a bulk medium built as a periodic concatenation of layers with self - focusing and self - defocusing kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that very accurate simulations of the so stabilized 2d solitons in the framework of the respective gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) demonstrate that they may be subject to an extremely slow decay @xcite .",
    "the methods using the periodic modulation of the nonlinearity belong to a broad class of techniques relying on the _ periodic management _ of solitons @xcite . in terms of the bec in one dimension ,",
    "another relevant example representing this class is the _ lattice management _ in the model where the strength of the ol is subjected to periodic time modulation @xcite ( in the experiment , this was used as a method to excite the condensate @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of the analysis of the model including the lattice management in combination with the self - repulsive nonlinearity , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , was identification of stability limits for several families of gap solitons in this setting ( fundamental solitons , double - hump bound states , etc . ) .",
    "also belonging to this general class are settings based on the periodic modulation in time of the strength of a parabolic potential trap which confines the condensate @xcite , and periodic modulation of the transverse trapping frequency which supports cigar - shaped bec configurations . in the latter case ,",
    "the  management `` may induce faraday waves in the condensate , as was predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is also relevant to mention that another variety of the ' ' management \" was proposed very recently , with the aim to stabilize 2d matter - wave solitons : driven rabi oscillations in a mixture of two mutually interconvertible bec species ( different states of the same atom ) , with self - attractive and self - repulsive intra - species interactions @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of the studies outlined above is the application of the lattice - management technique to multidimensional solitons .",
    "this topic includes several distinct problems , depending on the sign of the intrinsic nonlinearity . in the 1d setting , the lattice management for solitons in the attraction model is not a fundamentally important issue , because stable 1d solitons in the self - attractive condensate exist without any lattice experiment .",
    "however , the model with the intrinsic attraction poses a new problem in the 2d case , as , in the absence of the lattice , 2d solitons are unstable against the collapse , and , as said above , the simplest way to suppress the instability is provided by the use of the quasi-1d ol bbb2 .",
    "therefore , it may be interesting to identify stability limits for 2d solitons in the attractive model with the quasi-1d lattice whose strength is subjected to the periodic time modulation ; in particular , one may be wondering if the solitons may survive in the case when the modulation depth attains its maximum , so that the lattice periodically vanishes .",
    "this problem was a subject of recent work @xcite , which was also dealing with collisions between the 2d solitons , that may move freely in the unconfined direction .",
    "it was found that the actual stability region is quite limited : typically , the solitons loose their stability before the modulation depth attains @xmath5 .",
    "the objective of the present work is to construct soliton families and identify their stability boundaries in the 2d attractive model with the full 2d lattice subject to the time - periodic modulation . in the normalized form , the respective two - dimensional gpe for mean - field wave function @xmath6 is@xmath7 \\left [ \\cos \\left ( 2x\\right ) + \\cos \\left ( 2y\\right ) \\right ] \\psi ,",

    "@xcite , term @xmath14 is dropped from the potential in eq .",

    "actually , @xmath11 is measured in units of the recoil energy of atoms trapped in the ol . for a typical case of atoms of @xmath15li loaded in the ol with the period on the order of @xmath16 m , a characteristic value of the scaled frequency , @xmath17 ( see below ) , corresponds , in physical units , to the modulation rate on the order of several khz .",
    "an experimental implementation of the model may be provided by periodic attenuation of the intensity of the laser beams that create the ol . since this management mode can not change the sign of the ol s amplitude , the modulation coefficient in eq .",

    "@xcite and staliunas:2007a it was demonstrated that such potentials , if combined with the self - repulsive nonlinearity , give rise to anomalously narrow _ subdiffractive _ gap solitons , for which the usual second - order operator of the kinetic energy is , effectively , replaced by a fourth - order operator . on the other hand ,",
    "a piecewise - constant time - periodic modulation mode was considered , for both periodic and quasi - periodic 2d potentials , in recent work @xcite ( also in the combination with the self - repulsive nonlinearity ) .",
    "the result was generation of a multi - soliton lattice , starting from an initial localized state .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section iii",

    "the most noteworthy finding reported in section iv is that , depending on @xmath0 , the solitons may remain stable up to the maximum ( @xmath1 ) modulation depth , in contrast to the shallow modulation that limited the stability of the solitons supported by the quasi-1d ol @xcite .",
    "it is also worthy to mention a multi - resonance shape featured by the stability boundary in the @xmath21 plane , and an increase of the collapse threshold ( defined in terms of the soliton s norm ) provided by the time - modulated ol , in comparison with the static lattice , i.e. , the threshold may exceed the norm of the townes soliton . the minimum norm necessary for the stability of the solitons , @xmath22 ,",
