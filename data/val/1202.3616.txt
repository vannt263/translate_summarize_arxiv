    "an exciton is the bound state of an electron and a hole , and considering their bosonic character the question immediately arises whether they can condense into an exciton bose condensate@xcite .",
    "the quest for such exciton superfluidity has , over the past decade , increasingly focussed its attention to layered structures where one layer contains holes and the other layer contains electrons@xcite .",
    "the coulomb attraction between the electrons and holes then allows for the formation of so - called interlayer excitons . in 2004",
    "a condensate of interlayer excitons was successfully created in a heterostructure of two 2degs under the application of a perpendicular magnetic field@xcite . since",
    "then many other candidate materials were suggested that should support interlayer exciton condensation in the absence of magnetic fields , such as graphene@xcite or topological insulators@xcite .",
    "one class of candidate materials has not been considered yet , namely the mott insulators@xcite .",
    "the strong interactions between electrons make these materials currently one of the most fascinating and the least understood solid state compounds .",
    "when making heterostructures of @xmath3 and @xmath4-doped quasi - two - dimensional cuo@xmath5 layers one expects the formation of interlayer excitons , and these excitons will interact strongly with magnetic excitations , possibly leading to unexpected dynamics . to explore all these unexpected dynamics of the excitons in the strongly correlated system such as the exciton condensation , understanding the dynamics of single exciton will be the first step .",
    "heterostructures of @xmath3 and @xmath4-doped cuprates can be typically described by a strongly correlated model : the bilayer @xmath6 model , which is extended from two single - band @xmath6 model for each layer with coupling terms between the layers as following : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hopping of electrons in each layer @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the bilayer heisenberg model describing the undoped mott insulating state @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes the electron and spin operators respectively on site @xmath14 in layer @xmath15 .",

    "a virtual intermediate breakup of the exciton is in between the initial state ( figure [ figbexciton ] ) and the final state ( figure [ figbexcitondynamic ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the exciton is therefore the product of the kinetic energies of the holon and doublon divided by the energy of this virtual state , @xmath51.,width=325 ]    the essence of kato s perturbation method is that we now forbid all states with higher @xmath18 eigenvalues . in our model",

    "as can be verified from figure [ figexciton ] this process allows the hopping of excitons by virtually breaking the dopants apart .",
    "if we define the exciton operator in terms of electron creation operators @xmath55 the exciton hopping process can be formulated as @xmath56 e_i      \\label{excitonhopping}\\ ] ] note that in this hamiltonian , no break - up of the exciton is required .",
    "the virtual process as described before only enabled us to relate the single layer kinetic energies to the bilayer exciton kinetic energy , @xmath57 here @xmath33 is the hopping energy for a single electron , @xmath34 the hopping energy for a single hole and @xmath58 is the hopping energy for a bound exciton .",
    "in addition to this hopping process there are also second order processes that equal a shift in chemical potential of the excitons . in the limit that we are interested in , that of a single exciton , we neglect chemical potential terms .    in conclusion , we formulated a model for the strong coupling limit of @xmath18 that describes the motion of bound excitons in a mott insulator double layer .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath59 we will refer to this model as the _ exciton @xmath6",
    "model_.      the hopping term ( [ excitonhopping ] ) represents an exciton @xmath60 on site @xmath14 swapping places with the spin background @xmath61 on site @xmath62 .",
    "this hamiltonian is in the electron fock state representation with the background determined by the bilayer heisenberg model ( [ hj ] ) .",
    "historically the spin singlet - triplet basis turned out to be convenient in treating the bilayer heisenberg model , and consequently we will apply this representation also to the hopping term ( [ excitonhopping ] ) .    unlike the fermionic holes in the single layer case ,",
    "the exciton is composed of a fermionic doublon and holon in the same rung , and hence is a bosonic particle .",
    "the local hilbert space on each interlayer rung is five dimensional with basis in terms of five hard - core bosons as one interlayer exciton state @xmath63 and four different spin states . in the single - triplet basis , which is valid for both the doped and undoped case",
    ", we can introduce the four hard core - boson as one singlet state and three triplet states : @xmath64 then the hopping term [ excitonhopping ] can be reexpressed as : @xmath65 we can introduce the the total spin operator @xmath66 and the spin difference operator @xmath67 explicitly in terms of singlet and triplet rung states for @xmath68 , this reads @xmath69 in general , we see that the operator @xmath70 conserves the total onsite spin , while @xmath71 always changes the total spin number @xmath72 by a unit .",
    "the @xmath73-components of the spin operators do not change the magnetic number @xmath74 , while the @xmath75-components of the spin operators change the magnetic number by a unit .",
    "the bilayer heisenberg model is now written as @xmath76 in conclusion , we formulated the exciton t - j model in the singlet - triplet basis which will be a starting point to solve the dynamics of the single exciton .",
    "notice also that the hilbert space no longer contains fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the question is whether the disappearance of the fermionic structure also leads to the disappearance of the fermionic _ sign _ structure , which causes so much difficulties in the single layer @xmath6 model@xcite .",
    "the sign structure can be investigated as follows .",
    "remember that at half - filling the fermionic signs in the standard @xmath6 model on a bipartite lattice can be removed by a marshall sign transformation@xcite .",
    "upon doping , signs reappear whenever a hole is exchanged with ( for example ) a down spin .",
    "which matrix elements of the hamiltonian become positive ( and thus create a minus sign in the path integral loop expansion ) depends on the specific basis and on the specific marshall sign transformation .    for the double layer exciton model ,",
    "define a spin basis state with a built - in marshall sign transformation of the form ( compare to ref .",

    "these basis states the heisenberg terms are sign - free and the only positive matrix elements come from the exchange of an exciton with a @xmath81 triplet .    we conclude that , even though the model is purely bosonic , the exciton @xmath6 model is not sign - free and it is not possible to remove this sign structure using a marshall or similar transformation .",
    "however , as will be further elaborated upon in section [ sectionscba ] , for both the antiferromagnetic and singlet ground states these signs do cancel out . therefore for such ordered bilayers the problem of exciton motion turns out to be effectively bosonic .",
    "before considering the dynamics of the exciton and expressing the interaction between the exciton and the spin background , we need to derive a spin wave theory for the bilayer heisenberg model .",
    "similar to the traditional holstein - primakoff spin - wave theory , we need a classical reference state , i.e. the mean field ground state of the bilayer heisenberg model , then develop the linear order for the spin wave theory from the mean field ground state .",

    "can be found in appendix [ appendixlarges ] .",
    "the basic idea of a spin wave theory@xcite is to start from this semiclassical ( mean field ) ground state and describe the local excitations with respect to this ground state .",
    "one can immediately infer why the holstein - primakoff or schwinger approach to spin wave theories fails for the bilayer heisenberg model .",
    "first , the mean field ground state is no longer a nel state for finite @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , where holstein - primakoff describes one and schwinger describes two onsite spin excitations , the bilayer heisenberg has in fact three types of excitations .",
    "this has been pointed out by chubukov and morr@xcite , who called the third excitation the longitudinal mode .    here",
    "we want to point out that due to the local hilbert space and the mean field ground state as described by ( [ meanfield ] ) we can reach all states in the local hilbert space with three types of excitations : a longitudinal @xmath88 which keeps the magnetic number @xmath74 constant , and transversal @xmath89 who change the magnetic number @xmath74 by either @xmath90 . in the limit of large @xmath87",
    "these excitations tend to become purely bosonic .",
    "we will take the mean field ground state of ( [ meanfield ] ) and these three excitations as the starting point for the linear spin wave theory .",
    "finally , we must mention the obvious flaw in the above reasoning .",
    "where we criticized earlier spin wave theories because they predicted the wrong critical value of @xmath91 , we now apparently adopt such a wrong theory since ( [ largessol ] ) predicts @xmath92 for @xmath93 !",
    "nevertheless , as we show in appendix [ appendixqcp ] concerning @xmath68 , the presence of spin waves changes the ground state energy which makes the disordered state more favorable even below the mean field critical @xmath94 calculated above .",
    "hence , due to correctly taken the ground state energy shifts into account , one finds the accurate critical value for @xmath1 consistent with numerical calculations .",
    "we will now construct explicitly the spin wave theory described above for @xmath68 .",
    "first , one needs to find the ground state following equation ( [ meanfield ] ) . in the @xmath68 case , this amounts to a competition between the singlet state @xmath95 and the triplet @xmath96 .",
    "the mean field ground state on each rung is given by a linear superposition of those two , @xmath97 which interpolates between the nel state ( @xmath98 ) and the singlet state ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the onset of antiferromagnetic order can thus be viewed as the condensation of the triplet state in a singlet background.@xcite with @xmath100 alternating we have introduced a sign change between the two sublattices @xmath79 and @xmath101 .",
    "the angle @xmath102 will be determined later by self - consistency conditions .",
    "the three operators that describe excitations with respect to the ground state are @xmath103 the @xmath104-operators will later turn out to represent the longitudinal spin waves , whereas the @xmath105-operators represent the two possible transversal spin waves .",
    "the bilayer heisenberg model can be rewritten in terms of these operators . for completeness",
    "we include the parameter @xmath106 that enables a comparison with the ising limit ( @xmath107 ) with the heisenberg limit ( @xmath108 ) , @xmath109 given this , we can explicitly write down the spin operators in terms of the new @xmath104 and @xmath105 operators , as is done in appendix [ appendixbhm ] .    from the requirement that the hamiltonian does not contain terms linear in spin wave operators we obtain the self - consistent mean field condition for the ground state angle @xmath102 , @xmath110 which has two possible solutions . either @xmath111 , which corresponds to a singlet ground state configuration , the _ disordered phase_. if @xmath112 , there exists an",

    "we compare the ground state energy of both phases , from which we can deduce that the critical point lies at @xmath113 , consistent with numerical literature@xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the spin wave excitations can be found when if we consider only the quadratic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "this is called the _",
    "` linear ' _ spin wave approximation , and it amounts to neglecting the cubic and quartic interaction terms .",

    "more complex behavior at @xmath134 arises in the anti - adiabatic limit @xmath182 , where the kinetic energy of the exciton is large compared to the energy required to excite ( and absorb ) spin waves .",
    "consequently , many spin waves are excited as the exciton moves and the exciton becomes overdressed with multiple spin waves . at nonzero @xmath24 however , a very small quasiparticle peak remains with a bandwidth of order @xmath24 .",

    "in addition to the bound exciton states , a broad electron - hole continuum will show up at high energies .    when comparing the dielectric function with the computed spectral functions in figures [ figalphalarge]-[figybco ] , bear in mind that the latter are shifted over the energy @xmath206 required to excite an interlayer exciton .",
    "this energy is typically of the order of the interlayer coulomb energy .",

    "the distance between the layers is about twice the in - plane distance between nearest neighbor copper and oxygen atoms , but simultaneously we expect the dielectric constant @xmath222 along the @xmath2-axis to be smaller than @xmath223 due to the anisotropy in the screening . combining these two effects , we consider it a reasonable assumption that the interlayer exciton binding energy is comparable to the in - plane binding energy .",
    "the hopping energy for electrons is approximately @xmath224 ev which yields , together with a coulomb repulsion estimate of @xmath225 ev , an effective exciton hopping energy of @xmath226 ev .",
    "note that these estimates of @xmath227 justify our use of the strong coupling limit in section [ excitonparagraph ] .",
    "the spectral function corresponding to these parameters is shown in figure [ figybco ] . since @xmath228 the ladder spectrum is strongly suppressed compared to the aforementioned anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "however , the ising confinement still shows its signature in a small ` second ladder peak ' at @xmath229 ev energy above the exciton quasiparticle peak . to the best of our knowledge and to our surprise ,",
    "the @xmath2-axis optical conductivity of ybco has not been measured before .",
    "detection of this second ladder peak in future experiments would suggest that indeed the interlayer excitons in cuprates are frustrated by the spin texture .",
    "using a rung linear spin wave theory for the bilayer heisenberg model we constructed a theory of strongly bound excitons in a strongly correlated bilayer system .",
    "surprisingly , for small but finite @xmath230 the exciton becomes confined in a fashion similar to ising confinement .",
    "the resulting ladder spectrum should be visible in measurements of the dielectric function , such as eels , rixs or optical conductivity .",
    "possible candidate materials are for example heterostructures of @xmath4 and @xmath3-type doped cuprates such as nd@xmath231ce@xmath232cuo@xmath233/la@xmath231sr@xmath232cuo@xmath233 . in ybco or bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath234 ,",
    "the copperoxide layers come in pairs which suggests the possibility of interlayer charge - transfer excitons .",
    "a spectrum of @xmath2-axis excitons in undoped ybco is shown in figure [ figybco ] .",
    "our model can be extended to different stacking structures .",
    "for example , in 214 compounds the sites in adjacent cuprate layers do not lie above each other , and we might need to include new interlayer magnetic interactions such as the moriya - dzyaloshinskii interaction .",
    "different lattice structures can also be studied , of which the hexagonal lattice ( as in graphene ) is the most relevant .",
    "one may wonder to what extent the used approximations are generally valid , such as the linear and ideal spin wave approximation .",
    "for the single layer heisenberg model , it was shown that the next - to - leading order corrections where indeed significantly smaller@xcite , justifying the use of both approximations in that case .",
    "together with the fact that we were able to reproduce the known phase diagram and excitation spectrum , this suggests our approach for the bilayer heisenberg model is justifiable .",
    "nevertheless , an exact computation of the next - to - leading order corrections can quantify the errors of the used spin wave approximations .",
    "another approximation we used was the expansion in large @xmath23 , the exciton coupling strength .",
    "this coupling originates in the interlayer coulomb interaction , from which we only consider the on - site and nearest neighbor terms .",
    "therefore our model can not describe accurately the process of how excitons are formed out of separate doublons and holons .",
    "we think this is a very interesting open question , especially at finite temperatures .",
    "in addition , the formation process is also accompanied by an exciton annihilation process which we neglected in our current work .",
    "besides the interesting properties of the exciton formation process , we think that further research should be directed towards finite densities of excitons@xcite .",
    "the dynamical spin - hole frustration effects that are well known in the context of doped mott insulators occur in a strongly amplified form dealing with interlayer excitons in mott - insulating bilayer systems .",
    "this gives further impetus to the pursuit to create such finite density correlated exciton systems in the laboratory .",
    "one can wonder whether such physics is already at work in the four - layer material ba@xmath5ca@xmath216cu@xmath233o@xmath235f@xmath5 where self - doping effects occur creating simultaneously @xmath3 and @xmath4-doped layers@xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to create equilibrium finite exciton densities using conventional semiconductors@xcite , while exciton condensation has been demonstrated in coupled semiconductor 2degs @xcite . in strongly correlated heterostructures ,",
    "however , formation of finite exciton densities is still far from achieved , although recent developments on oxide interfaces indicate exciting potential ( see for example @xcite ) . besides the closely coupled @xmath3- and @xmath4-doped conducting interface - layers in these srtio@xmath216-laalo@xmath216-srtio@xmath216 heterostructures , further candidates",

    "the feasibility of this has already been experimentally demonstrated , e.g. in @xcite , but the exact interface effects need to be investigated in more detail , both experimentally as well as theoretically @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we will prove equation ( [ largessol ] ) .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian ( [ meanfield ] ) depends on the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order parameter @xmath237 .",
    "we must find the ground state energy of ( [ meanfield ] ) as a function of @xmath237 and then minimize with respect to @xmath237 , thus yielding the mean field value of the af order parameter .",
    "however , since we are only interested in the critical value @xmath28 where @xmath237 changes from nonzero to zero , we can proceed as follows . in the singlet phase ( @xmath238 ) the mean field hamiltonian",
