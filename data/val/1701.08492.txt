    "in @xcite , shannon defined the _ zero error capacity _ of a memoryless channel with finite input and output alphabets by the supremum of achievable rates of codes which have no decoding error .",
    "there are several reasons to study the zero error capacity  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the zero error capacity indicates the supremum of the achievable rates at which no errors can be tolerated and it thus indicates one of fundamental properties of the channel .",
    "secondly , the zero error capacity suggests a property of codes with extremely low decoding error probability on an environment which does not allow to lengthen the code length enough .",
    "shannon proposed the zero error capacity and , in addition , showed the equivalence to the maximum independent set problem on an undirected graph called a confusion graph  @xcite .",
    "exact evaluation of the zero error capacity of a channel is a challenging problem .",
    "no general solution that gives the exact value of the zero error capacity has been known .",
    "therefore , there have been many studies for deriving upper and lower bounds of the zero error capacity on general channels .",
    "for example , shannon showed that the logarithm of the independence number of a given confusion graph is a lower bound of the zero error capacity of the corresponding channel  @xcite .",
    "he also presented an upper bound based on the logarithm of the optimal value of a linear programming ( lp ) problem .",
    "unfortunately , this upper bound is not so tight for many problems in general .",
    "for example , this lp upper bound is larger than the zero error capacity of the channel corresponding to the cycle graph with 5-edges , i.e. , the pentagon graph .",
    "this means the lp upper bound is useless to determine the exact value of the zero error capacity of the pentagon graph .",
    "lovsz showed a tighter upper bound than the lp upper bound @xcite .",
    "the value of this upper bound is called the _ lovsz number _ , which can be computed by solving a semi - definite programming problem .",
    "it is well known that the lovsz number is equal to the value of the trivial lower bound in the case of the pentagon graph , i.e. , this means that the lovsz number is equal to the exact value of the zero error capacity .",
    "however , the zero error capacity of the cycle graph with 7-edges remains to be open .",
    "it is known that , if a confusion graph is a perfect graph , the upper and lower bounds shown by shannon coincide with each other .",
    "therefore , the zero error capacity of the channel corresponding to a perfect graph can be exactly evaluated  @xcite .    in the nne channels ,",
    "a transmitted symbol is a @xmath0-tuple of elements in @xmath1 .",
    "it is assumed that only one element error to a nearest neighbor element in a transmitted symbol can occur .",
    "figure  [ fig : nne_channel ] presents the channel transition graph of the nne channel in which a transmitted symbol is a @xmath2-tuple of elements in @xmath3 , i.e , @xmath4 .",
