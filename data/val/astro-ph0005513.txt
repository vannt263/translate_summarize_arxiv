    "the most successful p - process models available to - date call for the synthesis of the stable neutron - deficient nuclides heavier than fe in the o / ne layers of type ii supernovae ( snii ) ( rayet et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter rahpn ) . in spite of their many virtues in reproducing the solar - system p - nuclide abundance distribution ,",
    "they however suffer from some shortcomings .",
    "one of them concerns their persistent underproduction of the light mo ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and ru ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) p - isotopes .",
    "some have tried to remedy this situation with exotic solutions , calling in particular for accreting neutron stars or black holes ( e.g. schatz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the level of the contribution of such sites to the solar system content of the nuclides of concern here is quite impossible to assess in any reliable way .",
    "in contrast , it has been emphasized many times over the last decade that the problem might just be due to some misrepresentation of the production in the he - burning core of massive stars of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process ( e.g. arnould et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the aim of this letter is to scrutinize the latter , ` non - exotic ' , solution in a quantitative way by duly taking into account the uncertainties that still affect the rate of the @xmath1 reaction , as they appear in the nacre compilation of reaction rates ( angulo et al .",
    "clearly , these uncertainties in the key neutron producer in conditions obtained during central he burning in massive stars have a direct impact on the predicted abundances of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process , as already analyzed quantitatively by meynet & arnould ( 1993 ) . another potential embarassment of the p - process predictions identified by rahpn is a snii overproduction of oxygen relative to the p - nuclides . we show that this problem might be cured along with the one of the underproduction of the light mo and ru isotopes if the @xmath1 rate is modified adequately within a range permitted by the nacre compilation . for the sake of illustration",
    ", we just discuss here the case of a 25 m@xmath6 solar metallicity ( @xmath7 ) star .",
    "a more complete study dealing in particular with a set of stars with different masses and metallicities , and analyzing the impact of the uncertainties in the rates of a variety of reactions , is currently under way .",
    "the adopted input physics is briefly described in sect . 2 , and some results are presented in sect .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the calculations reported here are based on a model for a @xmath8 8 m@xmath6 helium star already considered by rahpn .",
    "it corresponds to a main sequence mass of about 25 m@xmath6 and is evolved from the beginning of core helium burning to the supernova explosion .",
    "details about this model can be found in hashimoto ( 1995 ) , and are summarized in rahpn . as in rahpn ,",
    "20 o / ne - rich layers with explosion temperatures peaking in the ( 1.8 - 3.3)@xmath9 k range are selected as the p - process layers ( ppls ) .",
    "their total mass is approximately 0.58  m@xmath6 .",
    "the deepest ppl is located at a mass of about 1.94  m@xmath6 , which is far enough from the mass cut for all the nuclides produced in this region to be ejected during the explosion .",
    "the p - process reaction network and its numerical solver are described by rahpn .",
    "a series of their selected nuclear reaction rates are updated , however . in particular , the nacre ` adopted ' rates are used for charged particle captures by nuclei up to @xmath10 . for heavier targets ,",
    "the rates predicted by the hauser - feshbach code most ( goriely 1997 ) are used , except for the experimentally - based neutron capture rates provided by beer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    as already pointed out in sect . 1",
    ", we turn our special attention to the impact of the uncertainties remaining in the rate of @xmath1 . for temperatures of about @xmath11 k at which the s - process typically develops during core he burning in massive stars ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) ,",
    "the nacre upper limit on this rate is 50 - 500 times larger than the ` adopted ' value ( see angulo et al .",
    "1999 for details ) . in order to quantify the consequences of this situation for the predicted abundance distribution of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process , and ultimately for the p - nuclide yields themselves",
    ", we perform nucleosynthesis calculations for five different rates ranging from the nacre adopted value to its upper limit .",
    "these rates , labelled r@xmath12 ( @xmath13=1 to 5 ) in the following , are defined and displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "cross section ( j.w .",
    "hammer & m. jaeger , private communication ) .",
    "rate estimates based on these new data are not available yet .",
    "it seems , however , that the revised upper limit might range somewhere between r@xmath14 and r@xmath15 they are used in the @xmath8 25 m@xmath16 star referred to above to calculate the abundances of the s - process nuclides at the end of core he burning .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 for the s - only nuclides .",
    "use of r@xmath17 leads to the classical ` weak ' s - process component pattern ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) , exhibiting a decrease of the overproduction ( with respect to solar ) of the s - nuclides by a factor ranging from @xmath18100 to about unity when the mass number @xmath19 increases from about 70 to 100 . in the heavier mass range ,",
    "the s - process ` main component ' supposed to originate from low- or intermediate - mass stars takes over .",
    "this ` canonical ' picture changes gradually with an increase of the @xmath1 rate , more @xmath20 having time to burn , releasing more neutrons , before he exhaustion in the core .",
    "the direct result of this is a steady increase of the overproduction of heavier and heavier s - nuclides .",
    "for example , with the extreme r@xmath21 rate , the overproduction factor increases from @xmath22 to @xmath23 for @xmath19 varying from about 70 to 90 , before decreasing to a value around unity for @xmath24 only .    at first sight",
    ", it might be felt that the s - process abundance distributions obtained with large enough r@xmath12 values exhibit some unwanted or embarrassing features .",
    "one of these concerns the underproduction of the @xmath25 s - nuclides relative to the @xmath26 ones .",
    "another one relates to the fact that a more or less substantial production of heavy s - nuclides ( like in the ba region ) would screw up the pattern of the s - process main component ascribed to lower - mass stars . in our opinion",
    ", none of these predictions can really act as a deterrent to @xmath1 rates substantially in excess of r@xmath17 . on the one hand ,",
    "the absence of ab initio self - consistent calculations of the s - process in low- and intermediate mass stars does not allow at this time to predict the exact shape of the main s - process component which is classically assigned to these stars . as a consequence , a contribution to the main component by massive stars can not be excluded , even if it may disturb some traditional views on the subject . on the other hand ,",
    "the reduction of the light s - process nuclide production by massive stars could well be compensated by their increased synthesis by some low- or intermediate - mass stars when rates larger than r@xmath17 are considered ( goriely & mowlavi 2000 ) .",
    "the classical @xmath27 overproduction problem found in the massive star s - process ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) could also be eased with increased @xmath1 rates , as demonstrated by fig .  2 .",
    "for these same rates , note that @xmath27 is not overproduced either in some of the calculations of goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) which predict high yields of the other light s - nuclides .",
    "figure  2 also suggests that a discrepancy , if any , between the observed ba overabundance in the sn1987a ejecta and the model predictions could be cured in a natural way by increasing the adopted @xmath1 rate .",
    "the [ ba / fe]@xmath28/[ba / fe]@xmath29 ratio is observationally still quite uncertain , values between about 5 and 20 having been reported ( e.g. mazzali & chugai 1995 ) .",
    "prantzos et al . ( 1988 ) have calculated lower values of 2.6 to 4.7 with the @xmath1 rate of fowler et al .",
    "this rate is on average comparable to r@xmath17 in the temperature range of relevance to the s - process .",
    "we have not conducted any new s - process calculation in a specific sn1987a progenitor model . instead , some rough estimates based on the procedure of prantzos et al .",
    "( 1988 ) in which their adopted s - process ba mass fraction is replaced by the one calculated for the model star adopted here have been made .",
    "assuming that the lmc metallicity is one third of the solar one , we predict [ ba / fe]@xmath28/[ba / fe]@xmath29 ratios from 3 to 14 for rates increasing from r@xmath17 to r@xmath30 .",
    "theory could thus account for quite substantial sn1987a ba productions with high enough @xmath1 rates ( compatible with the nacre data ) .",
    "as discussed by rahpn , it is a fair approximation to adopt the s - process abundance distributions of fig .  2 as seeds for the p - process .",
    "for the @xmath31 species , the initial abundances in the ppls are taken from the detailed stellar models .",
    "although these models have been obtained with rates that may differ from the nacre ones adopted here , this inconsistency is certainly not responsible for any intolerable distorsion in the predicted s - process seeds or p - process yields .",
    "the various seed abundances of fig .  2 are used to compute the production of the p - nuclides in the ppls of the @xmath8 25 m@xmath16 star considered here . as in rahpn",
    ", the abundance of a p - nuclide @xmath13 is characterized by its mean overproduction factor @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is its solar mass fraction ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass fraction of isotope @xmath13 at the mass coordinate @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the total mass of the ppls , the sum running over all the ppls ( @xmath38 corresponds to the bottom layer ) .",
    "an overproduction factor averaged over all 35 p - nuclei is calculated as @xmath39 , and is a measure of the global p - nuclide enrichment in the ppls .",
    "so , if the computed p - nuclei abundance distribution were exactly solar , the normalized mean overproduction factor @xmath40 would be equal to unity for all @xmath13 .",
    "figure 3 shows the normalised p - nuclide overproduction factors derived from the seed abundance distributions calculated with the @xmath1 rates r@xmath17 , r@xmath41 and r@xmath21 .",
    "changes in the shape of the p - nuclide abundance distribution are clearly noticeable , at least for @xmath42 .",
    "the use of r@xmath17 leads to a more or less substantial underproduction of not only @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , a ` classical ' result in p - process studies ( see rahpn ) , but also of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which was not predicted in previous calculations .",
    "this new feature directly relates to the larger abundances around @xmath45 used by rahpn ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "2 ) , in contrast to the much flatter seed distribution obtained with r@xmath17 .",
    "this kr - sr - mo - ru trough is gradually reduced , and in fact essentially disappears , for @xmath1 rates of the order or in excess of r@xmath41 .",
    "this situation is most clearly illustrated by fig .",
    "4 . in these very same conditions ,",
    "@xmath40 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 comes much closer to unity as well .",
    "it has to be noticed that this situation does not result from a stronger production of these two nuclides by the p - process , but instead from their increased initial abundances associated with a more efficient s - process when going from r@xmath17 to r@xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath40 pattern does not depend on the adopted @xmath1 rate for @xmath48 .",
    "this is expected from a mere inspection of the s - nuclide seed distributions displayed in fig .  2 .",
    "in particular , @xmath49 and @xmath50 remain underproduced .",
    "this can not be considered as an embarassment as these two nuclides can emerge from the s - process in low- or intermediate - mass stars .",
    "in addition , the overall efficiency of the p - nuclide production substantially increases with increasing @xmath20 burning rates .",
    "more specifically , @xmath51 is multiplied by a factor of about 15 when going from r@xmath17 to r@xmath21 .",
    "this could largely ease , and even solve , the problem of the relative underproduction of the p - nuclides with respect to oxygen identified by rahpn .",
    "for their considered 25 m@xmath6 model star calculated with the @xmath52 rate from caughlan et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , they obtain @xmath53 and report a value of 4.4 for the ratio of the oxygen to p - process yields .",
    "this value would come close to unity for @xmath1 rates in the vicinity of r@xmath41-r@xmath14 , as the p - nuclides would be about 3 to 6 times more produced than in rahpn .",
    "this letter makes plausible that the long - standing puzzle of the underproduction with respect to solar of the p - isotopes of mo and ru in snii explosions could be quite naturally solved by just assuming an increase of the @xmath1 rate over its ` nominal ' value .",
    "more specifically , this could be achieved by multiplying the nacre ` adopted ' rate by factors of about 10 to 50 in the temperature range at which the s - process typically develops during core he burning in massive stars .",
    "these factors are well within the uncertainties reported by nacre . as an important bonus ,",
    "this increased rate would also largely avoid ( i ) the underproduction of @xmath43 and of @xmath44 which we predict here for the first time to be concomitant to the light mo and ru one , ( ii ) the too low production of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and ( iii ) the overall underproduction of the p - nuclides with respect to oxygen noted by rahpn . in direct relation with an increased @xmath1 rate , more s - process ba",
    "could also be ejected by snii events .",
    "our predictions confortably overlap the range of ba overabundances reported for sn1987 .",
    "this array of pleasing features has of course not to be viewed as a proof of the validity of the assumption that the true @xmath1 rate is higher than usually thought .",
    "it may just be a hint that there might be ways around exotic solutions .",
    "this conclusion applies at least if one relies on the simplistic ( and the only ones to be available for our purpose ) supernova models used here and in previous p - process calculations ( see rahpn et references therein ) , as well as in a myriad of other explosive nucleosynthesis calculations ."
