    "both theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the resonance fluorescence of a driven atom can serve as a source of nonclassical light .",
    "for example , carmichael and walls , and kimble and mandel @xcite predicted that the resonance fluorescence from a single two - level atom driven by a coherent laser field of low intensity would exhibit photon antibunching .",
    "the prediction has been confirmed in many laboratories .",
    "the sub - poissonian statistics of the fluorescent photons emitted in a short time interval by a single atom was also investigated experimentally @xcite .",
    "there have been many theoretical investigations of squeezing in resonance fluorescence , both in terms of the total variances and in terms of the fluctuation spectra of the phase quadratures .",
    "walls and zoller , and loudon @xcite showed that the total quantum fluctuations in the phase quadratures of the resonance fluorescence of a driven two - level atom can be squeezed below the shot - noise limit .",
    "single - mode @xcite , or frequency - tunable two - mode @xcite squeezing with a finite bandwidth may be obtained , depending on the rabi frequency and detuning .",
    "this internally produced squeezing results in line narrowing in the resonance fluorescence spectra .",
    "phase - quadrature squeezing has also been studied in the presence of an applied squeezed vacuum",
    ".    experimental observation of squeezing in the fluorescence field has proved a great challenge , one problem being that atomic motion produces phase shifts which destroy squeezing @xcite .",
    "this difficulty was surmounted in the recent experimental advances in homodyne detection schemes of the fluorescent radiation of a single trapped ion reported by hoffges _",
    "_ @xcite . within the last couple of years , experiments carried out by zhao _",
    "_ @xcite have found some evidence of squeezing by measuring the phase - dependent fluorescence spectra of a coherently driven two - level atom with a long lifetime , stimulating the further exploration of squeezing in resonance fluorescence .",
    "very recently , squeezing in the quadrature with phase @xmath8 relative to the driving laser was observed for the first time in the resonance fluorescence of a single two - level atom @xcite .",
    "also very recently , we have found that squeezing in resonance fluorescence can be greatly enhanced in a frequency - tunable cavity @xcite , or in a squeezed vacuum .",
    "the latter works mainly in the regime over which anomalous spectra such as hole - burning and dispersive profiles @xcite occur , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 and @xmath5 , where squeezing occurs in the _ out - phase _ quadrature of the fluorescent field . in this paper",
    "we extend the study to the general case , and show that large squeezing occurs in _ different phase _",
    "quadratures of the fluorescent field , depending upon the values of the parameters .",
    "the large squeezing is associated with an atomic pure state ( a completely polarized state ) , and thereby with a large atomic coherence .",
    "perfect fluorescent squeezing may only take place for the particular squeezing number @xmath1 .",
    "there is previous evidence that the value @xmath1 is special .",
    "it has been shown that large squeezing in resonance fluorescence was produced for this input squeezed field @xcite , and that also for this value of @xmath7 the sidebands in the resonance fluorescence spectrum have the same linewidth as in the @xmath10 case @xcite .",
    "our model consists of a two - level atom with ground and excited states @xmath11 the hamiltonian ( in units of @xmath12 ) , is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the atomic inversion operator , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the atomic raising and lowering operators respectively , @xmath17 is the detuning , @xmath18 is the rabi frequency and @xmath19 is the laser phase .",
    "the squeezed vacuum is characterized by the squeezing photon number @xmath20 , the squeezing phase @xmath21 , and the strength of the two - photon correlations @xmath22 , which obeys    @xmath23    the value @xmath24 indicates an ideal squeezed vacuum , whilst @xmath25 corresponds to no squeezing at all  a thermal field .",
    "the squeezed vacuum may be ` turned off ' by setting @xmath10 . in the remainder of the paper , we take @xmath26 and thus @xmath27",
    ".    the optical bloch equations , modified by the squeezed vacuum , are of the form    @xmath28    with    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the in  phase ( x ) and out  phase ( y ) quadrature components of the atomic polarization , respectively .",
    "( we have assumed in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) that the applied em field is coupled to the @xmath32 component of the atom . )",
    "@xmath33 is the relative phase between the laser field and squeezed vacuum , and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the spontaneous decay rate of the atom into the standard vacuum modes .",
    "the modified decay rates of the x and y components of the atomic polarization are @xmath36 respectively , whilst @xmath37 is the decay rate of the atomic population inversion .",
    "it has been shown that such a coherently driven two - level atom interacting with the squeezed vacuum reservoir can collapse into a steady - state which is a pure state , for the case @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "this property is associated with anomalous spectral features in the resonance fluorescence and probe absorption .",
    "the condition for the atom to be in a pure state is that the quantity @xmath38 where @xmath39 takes the value one @xcite .",
    "we point out here that a steady pure state can , in fact , be achieved for other values of the squeezing phase as well , the requirement being that given @xmath2 @xmath18 and @xmath4 are chosen to satisfy @xmath40 .",
    "the general pure state has the form    @xmath41    where @xmath42 the conditions for the pure state ( [ pur ] ) for a few specific cases are given below :    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    notice that for resonant excitation , a pure state is only possible if @xmath46 in general , the pure state ( [ pur ] ) describes a completely polarized atom with the bloch vector @xmath47 lying on the bloch sphere with polar angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 see figure 1 .",
    "when @xmath52 and @xmath4 satisfy the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , then @xmath53 , and the atomic bloch vector ( polarization ) is in the y  z plane , whereas if the condition ( [ cond3 ] ) holds , we have @xmath54 and the atom polarizes in the x  z plane .",
    "the measurement of the quadrature squeezing spectrum requires the fluorescent radiation field to be first frequency filtered and then homodyned with a strong local oscillator field @xcite .",
    "the squeezing may also be detected in terms of the total normally - ordered variances of the phase quadratures in an alternative experimental scheme , where the total radiation field and the local oscillator are directly homodyned , without first frequency filtering . in this paper we interested in the latter quantity , which can be expressed in terms of the steady state solution of the bloch equations ( [ bloch ] ) as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the @xmath57-phase quadrature of the atomic fluorescence field , measured by homodyning with a local oscillator having a controllable phase @xmath57 relative to the driving laser . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are usually the in - phase ( x ) and out - of - phase ( y ) quadratures of the fluorescent field , respectively .",
    "@xmath60 is the total normally - ordered variance of the @xmath57-phase quadrature of the fluorescent field .",
    "the field is said to be squeezed when @xmath61 .",
    "the normalization we have chosen is such that maximum squeezing corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "( [ sstsq ] ) implies that the squeezing occurs at large values of the atomic coherences , @xmath63 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the total normally - ordered variances in the phase quadrature component of the fluorescent field reach their minimal value    @xmath64    when the quadrature phase @xmath65 , where    @xmath66    ( note that only when @xmath67 is the resonance fluorescence a noise - squeezed field . ) furthermore , if the atom is in a pure state , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath40 , then @xmath68 reduces to    @xmath69    showing that maximum squeezing occurs when @xmath70 therefore , a completely polarized atom always radiates a fluorescent field with @xmath71-phase quadrature squeezing .",
    "the quadrature phase @xmath71 is same as the longitudinal angle @xmath48 of the polarized atom in the bloch sphere .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ sth ] ) that the squeezing is maximal , @xmath72 if the equations @xmath40 and @xmath73 are _ simultaneously _ satisfied .",
    "we find that this is possible _ only _ for @xmath1 , and then analytic solution can be found .",
    "the appropriate values of @xmath18 and @xmath4 are @xmath74 where @xmath75 these expressions are consistent with the values presented in eqs .",
    "( [ cond1 ] )  ( [ cond3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath76 as @xmath77and then @xmath78    we comment briefly why maximal squeezing is only possible for a small value of @xmath79 whilst , for arbitrary values of @xmath20 and @xmath80 it is always possible to find values of @xmath18 and @xmath4 which produce a pure state @xmath81 , the condition @xmath82 is much more stringent .",
    "this value of @xmath83 implies that the external fields must not be so strong as to saturate the atom .",
    "this may be seen by examining the expression for @xmath84 we require @xmath85 clearly , @xmath86 if @xmath87even if @xmath88 the condition @xmath40 requires a nonzero value of @xmath89and thus if the conditions @xmath40 and @xmath90 can be satisfied , and it is not obvious from the outset that they can , we must have @xmath91    this argument does not explain why solutions are only possible for the _ particular _ value @xmath1 , but as we have remarked earlier , the value @xmath1 appears to be a special one from several points of view @xcite . for this value of @xmath7the two - photon correlation strength ,",
    "@xmath92 is rational : @xmath93and the principal decay rates are respectively twice and one - half the decay rate in the absence of the squeezed vacuum : @xmath94when",
    "@xmath95    for small values of @xmath7 large squeezing in the fluoresence is possible , even if it is not maximal .",
    "we may conclude from eq .",
    "( [ opti ] ) that when @xmath96 and @xmath9 , optimal squeezing in the fluorescent field always occurs in the out - of - phase ( y ) quadrature component , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath97 . when @xmath98 and @xmath99 , then @xmath100 , and optimal squeezing takes place in the @xmath8-phase quadrature @xcite .",
    "when @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then @xmath103 , and optimal squeezing is always in the in - phase ( x ) quadrature .",
    "we here present a detailed study of the fluorescence squeezing in the case of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which has previously received little attention . as we know from the above discussion , the squeezing is exhibited in the in - phase ( x ) quadrature component .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath106 , the in - phase quadrature of the fluorescent field , in a 3d plot against the rabi frequency @xmath18 and the squeezed phase @xmath80 , for @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "clearly , the greater squeezing occurs for large phases .",
    "when @xmath109 and @xmath101 , then @xmath110 displaying the optimal ( @xmath0 ) degree of squeezing .",
    "noting that the degree of squeezing in the squeezed vacuum input for @xmath111 is @xmath112 , we see that the squeezing in the resonance fluorescence output is substantially enhanced .",
    "we plot @xmath113 against @xmath18 and @xmath4 in fig . 3 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that for this value of @xmath7 near maximal squeezing occurs over wide values of the rabi frequency @xmath18 and detuning @xmath4 .",
    "figure 4 presents the total normally - ordered variance of the in - phase quadrature of the fluorescent field , @xmath113 , and the magnitude of the atomic bloch vector , @xmath116 , for the parameters : @xmath117 and different squeezed photon numbers ( a ) @xmath118 , ( b ) @xmath119 and ( c ) @xmath120 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent @xmath113 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "when @xmath40 , the atom is in a pure state .",
    "it is obvious that large squeezing in the resonance fluorescence of the two - level atom occurs for pure atomic states . when @xmath119 , maximal squeezing ( @xmath122 ) is achieved at the rabi frequency @xmath123 .",
    "the large squeezing is due to the large atomic coherence in the pure state .    when eq .",
    "( [ cond3 ] ) is satisfied , the atom is in the pure state ( [ pur ] ) with @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding total , normally - ordered variance @xmath124 of the in - phase quadrature of the fluorescent field is of the form    @xmath125    when @xmath126 @xmath127 .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ sqpure ] ) we have @xmath128 ( @xmath0 squeezing ) .",
    "the corresponding value of the rabi frequency is @xmath129 .",
    "we plot @xmath130 , indicated by the solid line , against @xmath20 in fig .",
    "5 , which demonstrates that large squeezing occurs for small photon numbers . for comparison , we also present the normally - ordered variance @xmath131 of the in - phase quadrature in the squeezed vacuum field , represented by the dashed line in this figure .",
    "it is clear that the squeezing of the output field ( fluorescence ) is greatly enhanced over the region @xmath132 , compared with the squeezing of the input ( squeezed vacuum ) field .",
    "hence , the atom may be applied as a nonlinear optical element to amplify squeezing .",
    "fluorescent field squeezing can also occur in other phase quadratures with the phase between @xmath134 ( in - phase ) and @xmath135 ( out - of - phase) for example , @xmath136 .",
    "the variance , @xmath137 , of such a phase quadrature is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where @xmath138 .",
    "it is obvious that fluorescence squeezing , @xmath139 , occurs over a range of @xmath140 , and the optimal ( @xmath0 ) degree of squeezing takes place around @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    as with in - phase quadrature squeezing , the optimal squeezing in the @xmath143-phase quadrature",
    "is also associated with a pure state ( a highly polarized atomic state ) .",
    "we plot @xmath137 and @xmath121 together in fig . 7 for the parameters : @xmath144 and different squeezed photon numbers ( a ) : @xmath118 , ( b ) : @xmath119 and ( c ) : @xmath145 .",
    "this figure clearly shows again that a completely polarized atom can emit a fluorescent field with large squeezing . when @xmath119 , maximal squeezing ( @xmath122 ) is obtained at the rabi frequency @xmath141 .",
    "we have shown that when @xmath146 and @xmath147 , the atom develops into a stationary pure state , given by ( [ pur ] ) with @xmath148 .",
    "this highly polarized atom radiates a fluorescent field with @xmath149-phase quadrature squeezing .",
    "the expression for the squeezing is same as eq .",
    "( [ sqpure ] ) , but for the @xmath8-phase quadrature .",
    "perfect squeezing is obtained for @xmath119 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the resonance fluorescence exhibits out - of - phase ( y ) quadrature squeezing when @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath18 obeys eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) , the atom collapses into the pure state ( [ pur ] ) with @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , the optimal y - quadrature squeezing , @xmath152 , is given by eq .",
    "( [ sqpure ] ) , as well . when the squeezed photon number @xmath119 and the rabi frequency @xmath153 , the maximal degree of the y - quadrature squeezing in the resonance fluorescence is achieved .",
    "we have shown that the total normally - ordered variance of the phase quadrature of the fluorescent field emitted from a coherently driven two - level atom interacting with a squeezed vacuum can be greatly ( or completely ) squeezed .",
    "the squeezing in the fluorescent field is greatly increased for small values of @xmath20 compared with the degree of squeezing of the input squeezed vacuum field .",
    "therefore , squeezing may be amplified through resonance fluorescence .",
    "the squeezing in the output may indeed be the maximum obtainable , when @xmath1 .",
    "analytic expressions for the conditions for maximum squeezing are obtained in this case .",
    "depending upon the values of the squeezed phase @xmath80 and the detuning @xmath4 , squeezing can occur in the in - phase , out - of - phase , or any other phase quadrature of the resonance fluorescence .",
    "large squeezing is always associated with the atom evolving into a pure state ( a highly polarized atomic state ) .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", a cavity configuration may be the best candidate to investigate the atom / squeezed - vacuum interactions @xcite . as shown in refs .",
    ", many squeezing - induced effects in free space can carry over to the cavity situations in the bad cavity limit , where the atom evolves in accordance with formally the same equations as those in free space .",
    "we expect that large squeezing in resonance fluorescence will still take place in the cavity configuration .",
