    "observations of sub - kpc radio structures in seyfert galaxies have shown the presence of linear radio sources resembling jets from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ; e.g. , ulvestad & wilson 1989 ) .",
    "thus , it is known that _ nuclear _ outflows from the agn are present in some seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is possible that , in some galaxies , these nuclear outflows extend out of the galaxy disk and manifest themselves as _ galactic _ outflows , perhaps as lower - power versions of the @xmath710@xmath0100 kpc scale jets in radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "however , agns in seyfert galaxies are weak optical and radio emitters ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) . in quasars , for example",
    ", emission from the agn dominates over that produced by the host galaxy , but this may not be the case in some seyfert galaxies .",
    "the host galaxies of seyfert nuclei are capable of driving powerful starburst - driven galactic outflows , similar to those found in classical starburst galaxies ( e.g. , heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) if the nuclear star formation rate is high enough ( e.g. , heckman  1995 , heckman  1997 ) .",
    "therefore , kiloparsec scale radio structures in seyfert galaxies ( baum  1993 ; colbert  1996 ) could be produced by galactic outflows from a nuclear starburst or by nuclear outflows from the agn .",
    "we are currently conducting a research program to study the properties of these large - scale ( r @xmath41 kpc ) outflows ( lsos ) in seyfert galaxies in order to investigate their nature and origin .",
    "we have selected a distance - limited sample of 22 edge - on seyfert galaxies ( see colbert  1996b , hereafter paper  i ) and have searched for emission from lsos from these galaxies at optical ( paper  i ) and radio wavelengths ( colbert  1996a , hereafter paper  ii ) . in paper",
    "i , we showed that optical emission suggestive of lsos was present in @xmath8 of all galaxies observed . in paper",
    "ii , we found that kiloparsec - scale radio structures were present in @xmath9 of all galaxies observed .",
    "these results show that lsos are quite common in seyfert galaxies . in paper",
    "ii , we also found that the radio structures have diffuse morphologies similar to bubbles or lobes and that the morphologies are generally different from a spherical halo structure that is observed in the starburst galaxy m82 ( seaquist & odegard 1991 ) . in the present paper , we present rosat soft x - ray ( 0.2 @xmath0 2.4 kev ) images of eight of the 22 galaxies from the distance - limited sample in order to study the x - ray properties of lsos in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the observational data and data reduction are described in section 2 and the images and results are presented in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss the properties of the extended x - ray emitting gas .",
    "implications on the nature of lsos in seyfert galaxies are discussed in section 5 .",
    "a summary is given in section 6 .",
    "for ease of reference , in table [ tableone ] , we list the 22 seyfert galaxies from the edge - on sample ( paper  i ) and their assumed distances .",
    "the nasa heasarc database of all pointed rosat observations was used to select public archival data , taken with either the position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) or high - resolution imager ( hri ) .",
    "data were available for ten of the 22 galaxies listed in table 1 .",
    "the selected data were retrieved from the u.  s. archives at nasa s goddard space flight center .",
    "a list of the archival  data is given in table [ tab6.1 ] .",
    "for each observation , we list the offset of the optical position of the galaxy ( see paper  i , table 1 ) from the pointing center , date of the observation , instrument used , exposure time , net counts and net count rates from the galaxy .",
    "net counts were calculated by extracting source counts from circular regions of radius 1  and background counts from source - free regions surrounding the x - ray source ( typically circular annuli ) .",
    "ngc  4945 has a very large angular size compared to the other galaxies . for this galaxy",
    ", we used a rectangular source region of width 7.4  and length 21.6  oriented along pa 42 . for comparison ,",
    "we also list ( table [ tab6.1 ] , column 8) the expected count rate for a hypothetical source with a 0.2@xmath02.4 kev luminosity of 10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 and a thermal spectrum with temperature kt @xmath10 1.0 kev with absorption from cold gas in our galaxy .",
    "this luminosity and spectrum are typical of a starburst - driven galactic outflow ( e.g. , armus 1996 ) and of what might be expected from an lso .",
    "count rates were calculated with the xspec x - ray spectral fitting software package , using the galactic absorption columns listed in column 9 .",
    "note that the hypothetical `` 10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 '' lso count rates are comparable in magnitude to the uncertainties in the total count rates ( column 7 ) , so it is necessary to spatially resolve sources with luminosities @xmath710@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 in order to detect them .",
    "the point - spread functions of the pspc and hri are dependent on the x - ray spectrum , but typical gaussian core widths are 20@xmath030  and 7@xmath010   full - width half - maximum ( fhwm ) , respectively .",
    "although the pspc has poorer resolution , it is much more sensitive than the hri , due to its very low internal background count rate .",
    "the energy range of both instruments is @xmath70.2@xmath02.4 kev .",
    "approximate total background rates for the two instruments are 1.4 and 3.8 @xmath1 10@xmath11 counts  s@xmath3  arcmin@xmath12 , for the pspc and hri , respectively .",
    "it is instructive to compare the background count rate in a detect cell to the hypothetical `` 10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 '' lso count rates listed in table [ tab6.1 ] , column 8 . for the pspc ,",
    "@xmath790% of the source counts fall within radius 23 , so that we expect a background count rate of 0.06 @xmath1 10@xmath12 s@xmath3 in a detect cell .",
    "this is much lower than the hypothetical `` 10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 '' count rates , so the pspc data are easily sensitive to lso x - ray emission , as long as the emission can be resolved from the nuclear source . for",
    "the hri , @xmath790% of the source counts fall within a radius of @xmath710 , so the expected background count rate in a @xmath710radius detect cell is 0.03 @xmath1 10@xmath12 s@xmath3 .",
    "again , in all cases , 10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 emission from an lso would be detected as long as it is resolved from the nuclear source .",
    "two ( ngc  4602 and ngc  7410 ) of the ten galaxies were not detected ( count rate @xmath132@xmath14 above the background using a 1  radius detect cell ) . by comparing the upper limits to the count rates ( table 2 , column 7 ) with those of the hypothetical `` 10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 '' source ( table 2 , column 8) , we note that the total 0.2@xmath02.4 kev luminosities of these two galaxies are less than several @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "images of the remaining eight galaxies were made using the pros x - ray reduction software in iraf .",
    "first , the raw images were binned by a factor of 8 to make new images with 4  pixels .",
    "these images were were then smoothed with a gaussian kernel of @xmath1524 . for the hri data ,",
    "higher resolution images were also made by smoothing with a gaussian kernel of @xmath158 .    in table",
    "[ tab6.2 ] , we list the eight galaxies for which contour maps are presented , along with the angular size of 1.0 kpc at the assumed distance and the figure number of the contour map of the image . note that for most of the galaxies , the pspc resolution of @xmath725  is too poor to resolve any emission within @xmath75 kpc .",
    "the hri resolution is significantly better .",
    "contour levels for all plots are in units of counts  pixel@xmath3 ( 225 counts  arcmin@xmath12 ) .",
    "we do not attempt to model the spectra of the x - ray data .",
    "the relatively low number of total counts and inadequate energy range ( @xmath132.4 kev ) of the pspc detector make spectral fitting a two - component model ( e.g. , a power - law for the agn and a thermal spectrum for the lso ) infeasible .",
    "although the hri is capable of resolving extended emission from the lso , the pulse height amplitude ( pha ) channels of the hri are not calibrated very well in energy , so it is not possible to estimate the temperature of any resolved thermal emission from the hri observations .",
    "here we present and discuss the rosat hri and pspc soft x - ray images for individual seyfert galaxies in the edge - on sample .",
    "_ ngc  2992 . _",
    "the hri image of ngc  2992 was previously published by weaver  ( 1996 ) , but they did not note the presence of any extended x - ray emission . in figure 1a , we show a contour map of the hri image of ngc  2992 . it is immediately obvious that the companion galaxy ngc  2993 is also a source of soft x - ray emission .",
    "it is also clear that soft x - ray emission extends out to @xmath71  ( @xmath79 kpc ) to the southeast in pa @xmath7100 , roughly along the galaxy minor axis .",
    "although the pspc image ( not shown ) is much more sensitive to faint emission , the strong emission from the nuclear source dominates the image and thus no extended emission is resolved .",
    "_ ngc  4235 . _",
    "the x - ray source in both ( 1992 june and 1992 december ) pspc images of ngc  4235 is unresolved .",
    "the pspc resolution of @xmath725  corresponds to @xmath73.9 kpc and the x - ray emission from the nuclear source certainly dominates over any possible extended x - ray emission on kpc scales .",
    "_ ngc  4388 . _ the hri image of ngc  4388 was previously published by matt  ( 1994 ) .",
    "these authors found extended emission out to radii @xmath745   ( 7.3 kpc ) , roughly evenly distrubuted over all azimuthal angles .",
    "contour maps of the hri and pspc images are shown in figures 1b and 1c , respectively . in the pspc image",
    ", we note the presence of a larger scale x - ray structure , extending out to radii @xmath72  ( 19.5 kpc ) in p.a . @xmath765 .",
    "_ ngc  4602 . _ a field near ngc  4602 was observed with the pspc , but ngc  4602 was not detected .",
    "unfortunately , during the observation , ngc  4602 was offsect @xmath719.2  from the center of the field of view , which is near the support ring on the pspc detector",
    ". _ ngc  4945 . _ in figure 1d , we show a contour plot of the 1992 august pspc image of ngc  4945 , overlaid on a grayscale plot of the optical emission .",
    "ngc  4945 is very near the galactic plane ( @xmath16 13 ) and , consequently , the galactic absorbing column is quite large ( n@xmath17 1.5 @xmath1 10@xmath18 cm@xmath12 , table 2 ) .",
    "thus , soft x - ray emission below @xmath71@xmath02 kev will be severely absorbed in the image .",
    "no extended soft x - ray emission is evident in the 1993 july pspc image either .",

    "_ this galaxy is located at a distance of @xmath764 mpc , at which the pspc resolution of @xmath725  corresponds to @xmath77.8 kpc .",
    "more complications arise because this type  1 seyfert nucleus is a very luminous x - ray source and photons within radii @xmath7 2  ( corresponding to physical distances @xmath1335 kpc ) are dominated by the unresolved nuclear source .",

    "@xmath7150 , roughly the same orientation as the large - scale radio emission ( paper  ii ) . on smaller scales ,",
    "as shown in the hri image ( figure 2c ) , the emission is extended in roughly the same p.a .",
    "_ eso  103-g35 . _",
    "the galaxy eso  103-g35 was observed with the pspc , but very few ( @xmath773 ) net counts were detected .",
    "we do not find any evidence for extended x - ray emission .",
    "_ ngc  7410 . _",
    "the pspc observation of the galaxy ngc  7410 was quite short ( @xmath71 ksec ) and there were only 7.4@xmath205.5 net counts from the galaxy , too weak to claim a definite detection .",
    "_ ngc  7590 . _",
    "the pspc observation of ngc  7590 was also quite short and we do not find any evidence for extended emission in the image .      as mentioned in section 2 ,",
    "all of the images are sensitive to soft x - ray luminosities of @xmath710@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 , comparable to what would be expected from an lso .",
    "thus , the only issue with respect to the suitability of the data for detecting extended emission from lsos with luminosities @xmath410@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 would be whether the emission can be resolved from the bright nuclear x - ray source . as can be seen from the angular scales listed in table [ tab6.2 ] , the pspc image of only one galaxy ( ngc  4945 ) has spatial resolution suitable for resolving sources on scales @xmath71@xmath02 kpc .",
    "the three hri images of ngc  2992 , ngc  4388 and ngc  5506 also have suitable resolution for imaging emission on scales @xmath41 kpc .    although the spatial resolution of the pspc images is @xmath73@xmath05 times worse than the hri , the pspc images are useful for searching for very extended x - ray emission , such as that in ngc  4388 .",
    "for example , the pspc images of ngc  2992 , ngc  4235 , ngc  4388 , ngc  4945 , ngc  5506 and ngc  7590 are sensitive to emission on size scales @xmath43@xmath05 kpc .    in summary , rosat imaging data suitable for searching for emission from lsos on scales",
    "@xmath41 kpc were available for four of the eight galaxies , and data suitable for searching for emission @xmath43@xmath05 kpc were available for six of the eight galaxies .",
    "for comparison , large - scale radio structures from lsos have typical radii of @xmath71@xmath05 kpc ( paper  ii ) .      as mentioned in section 3.1 , three ( ngc  2992 ,",
    "ngc  4388 and ngc  5506 ) of the galaxies show extended emission at radii @xmath4 1 kpc .",
    "ideally , one would like to make an image of the extended emission by subtracting the unresolved nuclear source .",
    "unfortunately , this is not a straightforward procedure as the point - spread functions for both instruments are dependent on the energy spectrum of the source ( especially for the pspc ) .",
    "in addition , especially important for the hri , an uncertainty in the aspect solution returned by the spacecraft introduces non - axisymmetric errors on size scales of @xmath75@xmath010 .",
    "subtraction of the nuclear source could be attempted if there is a bright unresolved x - ray source near the pointing center that can be used as a point - spread function , but such sources were not present in the rosat images of these galaxies .",
    "aspect errors can be reduced using sophisticated image reconstruction methods ( e.g. , morse 1994 ) ; however , these methods were not found to be very effective for these observations , due to the relatively low number of total counts . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe measurements of the net counts of the extended soft x - ray emission in these three galaxies .",
    "the extended emission in ngc  2992 ( figure 1a ) extends along pa 112 , but does not appear extended along other pas .",
    "the surface brightness of the extended emission in the hri image is only slightly brighter than that from the wings of the unresolved nuclear source . in order to make evident the faint extended emission , in figure [ xfig9 ] ,",
    "we show radial profiles of the x - ray emission in four quadrants ( pa @xmath10 -30 @xmath0 60 , 60 @xmath0 150 , 150 @xmath0 240 , and 240 @xmath0330 ) . the radial profile for the second quadrant ( as listed above )",
    "is significantly peaked above the others ( which serve as model psfs ) between @xmath735  and 45 .",
    "this excess is noticeable in radial profile plots binned at either 10 or 20 photons per radial bin , i.e. , it is not a chance surplus of photons caused by binning the data ( see figure [ xfig9 ] ) .",
    "for example , between radii 35  and 45 , there are 20 total counts in the second quadrant and 27 total counts from _ all three other quadrants together_. after background subtraction , the net number of counts of this extended emission in the second quadrant is 11.0@xmath204.8 .",
    "as noted in table [ tab6.1 ] , relatively few source counts were detected in the data .",
    "the hri image ( figure 1b ) appears extended , but only @xmath7150 counts are present in the raw image .",
    "the pspc image also shows extended emission , is more sensitive , and contains more counts in the raw image .",
    "we use this image to estimate the count rate of the extended emission . in order to verify that the extended emission was not due to ` ghost images ' of very soft ( e @xmath13 0.2 kev ) photons ( nousek & lesser 1993 ) , we omitted photons from pi channels 16 ( of 256 ) and below . the total number of counts within a circle of radius 1  ( which encloses @xmath2195% of the total counts from a point source ) is 441 .",
    "the total counts within a tilted rectangular region of width 2.5  and length 4.1 , oriented along pa 46.5(enclosing the whole galaxy ) is 784 , a difference of 343 counts .",
    "after subtraction of the background photons , this becomes 113 net counts .",
    "although the central source may be contributing some of the photons beyond radii 1 , this amounts to less than 5% of 339 net ( background subtracted ) counts , or less than 17 photons .",
    "taking this uncertainty into account , the net counts and uncertainty of the extended x - ray emission is 113@xmath2028 .",
    "as can be seen in figure 2c , the extended emission surrounding the central x - ray source in ngc  5506 is oriented along pa @xmath7160 , but has a rather large opening angle . in figure [ xfig11 ]",
    ", we show a radial profile of the counts per unit area , binned so there are at least 20 photons for each data point . since the extended emission in ngc  5506",
    "is directed over a large range in pa , we can not easily use radial profiles in other pa ranges to model the psf ( as we did for ngc  2992 ) .",
    "instead , for comparison , we also plot the radial profile from a deep observation ( 106,359 net counts ) of the point source hz43 , taken from a rosat hri calibration observation ( rosat sequence number rh141873n00 ) .",
    "the hz43 profile has been normalized to the ngc  5506 profile by dividing by the ratio of the total number of counts  area@xmath3  time@xmath3 for ngc  5506 to that of hz43 .",
    "the area used was that within radius 10 .",
    "ngc  5506 begins to show an increased x - ray surface brightness above the hz43 psf beyond radius @xmath75 .",
    "as noted above , the aspect solutions for hri observations can produce errors on @xmath710  scales , so it it is not clear whether the apparent extent between 5 and 10  is real .",
    "however , the excess emission becomes even more pronounced between radii @xmath710  and 25 , which is not due to improper aspect solution .",
    "a conservative estimate of the net extended counts , calculated by subtracting the total counts from ngc  5506 between 10 and 25  from that of the normalized hz43 distribution , is 72@xmath2013 .      in table",
    "[ tab6.3 ] , we list ranges of the size of the extended emission in the three galaxies . also listed is the range in pa over which the emission is extended , the net counts , and the net count rates of the extended emission .",
    "estimating fluxes and luminosities of the extended emission requires knowledge about the intrinsic spectrum of the emission .",
    "we assume a thermal spectrum ( raymond & smith 1977 ) with absorption due to cold gas in our galaxy . in table",
    "[ tab7.3 ] , column 4 , we list 0.2@xmath02.4 kev luminosities of the extended emission for assumed thermal spectra for two sample plasma temperatures : ( 1 ) kt @xmath10 0.1 and ( 2 ) kt @xmath10 1.0 kev .",
    "we have used the x - ray spectral fitting program xspec to calculate x - ray fluxes from pspc and hri count rates , using the galactic absorption columns listed in table 2 .",
    "we explore several possibilities for the emission mechanism producing the observed soft x - rays .",
    "the extended soft x - ray emission originates from regions @xmath41 kpc from the nucleus , so it is not likely to be scattered x - rays from the nuclear x - ray source .",
    "the electron - scattering region in seyfert galaxies is estimated to be @xmath7 1 pc ( e.g. , krolik & begelman 1986 ) .      in bright jets such as that in m87 , soft ( e @xmath7 1 kev )",
    "x - ray emission from knots or hotspots is consistent with synchrotron emission ( e.g. , biretta 1993 ) .",

    "however , the lifetime of the relativistic electrons which would produce such high energy x - ray synchrotron emission is much shorter than that of electrons producing cm - wave radio emission .",
    "specifically , the lifetimes are a factor [ @xmath23(x - ray)/@xmath23(radio)]@xmath24 shorter .",
    "this means that the electrons emitting 1  kev synchrotron emission live @xmath710@xmath25 as long as the ones emitting at 6  cm , or @xmath710@xmath26 yrs , based on the 6  cm radio synchrotron lifetimes of the large - scale radio structures ( paper  ii ) .",
    "since there is no evidence on kiloparsec scales for a source that would supply relativistic electrons ( e.g. , a jet ) , we disregard synchrotron emission as a possible emission mechanism .",
    "since the x - ray luminosities of the extended emission is @xmath21  10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 ( table 5 ) , over 100 x - ray binaries emitting at 10@xmath27 erg  s@xmath3 would be required to provide enough x - ray emission .",

    "the fact that the extended x - ray emission is roughly co - spatial with large - scale diffuse radio emission ( section 4.3 ) argues that hot plasma in an lso is producing extended , _ diffuse _ x - ray emission .",

    "however , it is noteworthy that the deep rosat observations strongly reinforce the presence of lsos in these galaxies , confirming the evidence provided by optical and radio observations .",
    "wilson ( 1994 ) shows that at least four of six seyfert galaxies studied in their research program show spatially extended soft x - ray emission .",
    "this suggest that extended soft x - ray emission from lsos is common in seyfert galaxies .",
    "since lsos are so common , the soft x - ray emission from lsos could , in some cases , explain the `` soft excess '' component observed in total aperture x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies , which is present in @xmath450% of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , turner  1991 ) .    a systematic study of the frequency of occurrence of x - ray halos in edge - on normal and starburst galaxies has not been done .",
    "rosat x - ray luminosities of halos that have been detected in normal and starburst galaxies are @xmath7 several @xmath1 10@xmath46 erg  s@xmath3 ( see , e.g. , bregman & houck 1997 ) , which is a factor of @xmath710 or more smaller than the luminosities of the extended emission we find in our study of seyferts .",
    "this may indicate that there are two different types of outflows occurring",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the results of a study of normal and starbursting galaxies with our results for seyfert galaxies .",
    "we can investigate the state of the gas in the lsos by comparing the implied pressures and filling factors of the optically - emitting gas , the radio plasma , and the x - ray plasma .",
    "first we compare the optical and x - ray emitting gas .",
    "optical line ratios from emission - line clouds at distances @xmath131 kpc from the seyfert nucleus ( in the so - called extended narrow - line region [ enlr ] ) suggest that the clouds have electron densities n@xmath47 10@xmath48@xmath010@xmath26 cm@xmath11 and temperatures t@xmath50 @xmath34 10@xmath5 k ( e.g. , robinson 1989 , robinson 1994 ) , implying pressures n@xmath50kt @xmath7 10@xmath51@xmath010@xmath52 dyne  cm@xmath12 .",
    "we found that the extended x - ray emission from ngc  2992 , ngc  4388 and ngc  5506 is located at larger radii ( between @xmath72 and 13 kpc . ) since the pressure of outflowing wind gas is expected to drop as @xmath53 , the pressures of hot x - ray gas at the smaller radii of the enlr clouds ( @xmath71 kpc ) will be higher than those listed in table 5 .",
    "for example , lso gas with pressures @xmath7",
    "10@xmath54@xmath010@xmath55 @xmath56 dyne  cm@xmath12 ( the range for the three galaxies listed above ; table 5 ) at a sample radius of 5 kpc will have higher pressures @xmath710@xmath57@xmath010@xmath58 @xmath56 dyne  cm@xmath12 at @xmath71 kpc .",
    "these pressures are roughly consistent with the electron pressures of the enlr gas at the same radii ( @xmath7 10@xmath51@xmath010@xmath52 dyne  cm@xmath12 ) .",
    "thus , if the x - ray gas and the enlr clouds are in pressure equilibrium , then the x - ray filling factor @xmath59 0.1@xmath01 .",
    "next , we compare the radio - emitting plasma with the x - ray plasma .",
    "the minimum - energy magnetic pressures of the large - scale radio structures imply that the kpc - scale _ radio plasma _ has pressures @xmath710@xmath60@xmath010@xmath61 @xmath62 dyne  cm@xmath12 , where @xmath63 is the volume filling factor of the radio plasma ( paper  ii ) . assuming pressure balance between the x - ray and radio - emitting plasmas ( a reasonable assumption since the large - scale x - ray and radio structures are roughly co - spatial ) , the ratio of filling factors @xmath64 10@xmath25 , i.e. , there is heavy mixing of thermal gas within the radio - emitting volume or the radio plasma is confined to filamentary ( or shell - like ) regions .    in summary ,",
    "our results suggest that the outflowing material in the lsos of seyfert galaxies is primarily composed of hot , thermal x - ray emitting gas ( with only a small contribution of synchrotron - emitting relativistic electrons ) .",
    "the radio and x - ray plasmas are assumed to be in rough pressure equilibrium with the optical enlr clouds .",
    "krolik & vrtilek ( 1984 ) describe a scenario in which the enlr clouds in fact condense out of outflowing wind gas and create a two - phase medium in the enlr , which is consistent with our results .      in paper",
    "ii , we noted that the large - scale radio structures in galaxies in our sample had diffuse morphologies , but that the morphologies did not resemble radio halos in starburst galaxies ( like m82 ) .",
    "we concluded that lsos are most easily understood as agn - driven outflows that are somehow diverted away from the galaxy disk on scales @xmath41 kpc .",
    "various mechanisms ( e.g. , cloud collisions , bending by ram pressure forces , and buoyancy forces ) may act to divert the outflows as they blow outward from the nuclear region .    in the present paper",
    ", we find that lsos are primarily composed of hot , x - ray emitting plasma , which suggests that , on kpc - scales , the outflows are more similar to wide - angled winds than to radio plasma jets from the agn .",
    "a possible explanation is that agn - driven jets entrain large amounts of gas as they make their way out of the galaxy .",
    "the entrained gas could be shock - heated to temperatures @xmath410@xmath28 k by winds with velocities @xmath4300 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "another possibility is that the outflows originate as winds very close to the nucleus .",
    "if the jets are stopped at small radii from the nucleus , the kinetic energy of the jet may become thermalized and heat the gas in the nuclear region ( as does a compact starburst for a starburst - driven wind , see heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) .",
    "the high - pressure region can then blow out of the galaxy disk in a wind .",
    "a nuclear starburst can also power a galactic wind in a seyfert galaxy , if the nuclear star - formation rate is high enough . in the wind scenario ,",
    "the large - scale x - ray and radio structures would tend to be oriented perpendicular to the galaxy major axis , which is the case for some lso seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4388 ) .",
    "detailed studies are needed to determine which energy source ( agn or nuclear starburst ) dominates the energy input to the lso in any given galaxy .",
    "rosat pspc and hri soft x - ray imaging data for ten of the 22 galaxies from the complete sample were retrieved from the rosat archives and analyzed .",
    "eight of these galaxies were detected .",
    "suitable data for detecting extended soft ( 0.2@xmath02.4 kev ) x - ray emission on size scales @xmath41 kpc were available for four galaxies and extended soft x - ray emission was found in three ( ngc  2992 , ngc  4388 and ngc  5506 ) of these four galaxies .",
    "the extended soft x - ray emission has 0.2@xmath02.4 kev x - ray luminosities between 0.4 and 3.5 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg  @xmath3 .",
    "each one of these three galaxies also has strong evidence for a large - scale outflow from previous optical and/or radio observations ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "the large - scale radio , optical and x - ray emission is roughly co - spatial , and the soft x - ray emission is most plausibly explained by thermal emission from a gas in a galactic outflow . assuming pressure balance between the radio and x - ray plasmas , the filling factor of the x - ray emitting gas is @xmath410@xmath5 times larger than that of the radio plasma .",
    "large - scale outflows in seyfert galaxies are most easily explained as wide - angled winds ( as opposed to collimated jets ) of hot , x - ray emitting gas that blow away from the nuclear region .",
    "we favor an interpretation in which lsos originate as agn - driven jets that entrain and heat gas on kpc scales as they make their way out of the galaxy .",
    "an alternate explanation is that lsos originate as winds on small scales and this could be occurring in galaxies in which the lsos are oriented roughly perpendicular to the galaxy major axis .",
