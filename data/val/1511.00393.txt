    "vibration signals generated by faults in rotating components have been widely studied .",
    "detecting and extracting transient vibration signatures is of vital importance for vibration - based detection of faults in rotating machinery .",
    "however , the observed vibration signals are usually corrupted by very heavy background noise @xcite .",
    "many diagnostic techniques have been developed to extract the fault features based on different transforms , such as short time fourier transform ( stft ) @xcite and wavelet transform @xcite .",
    "some methods use morphological decomposition methods , such as empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) @xcite , or demodulation @xcite .",
    "some methods combine conventional time - frequency analysis with other techniques suitable for transients detection , such as bispectrum - based method @xcite and spectral kurtosis ( sk ) based methods @xcite .",
    "the use of sparse representations for fault detection was initially illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where basis pursuit denoising ( bpd ) @xcite was adopted to exploit the sparsity of vibration signals in different domains in order to detect and extract fault features . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author considered a morphological component analysis ( mca ) problem @xcite , which is a sparsity - based decomposition approach , to improve the extraction of fault features . in ref .",
    "@xcite matching pursuit ( mp ) @xcite was used on a customized dictionary to extract oscillatory fault features . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a sparse representation using the tunable q - factor wavelet transform @xcite is utilized to extract oscillatory fault features .",
    "most recently , sparse coding techniques are introduced for fault feature extraction @xcite .",
    "the periodicity ( also called fault characteristic or fundamental frequency in some cases ) of potential fault features is very important information for fault diagnosis . in many cases ,",
    "this information can be simply obtained using the geometry of the specific components under steady rotating speed , or directly obtained from the user operation manual .",
    "it is already required as necessary information in many fault diagnosis methods @xcite .",
    "some fault diagnosis methods use periodicity information as a verification step after feature extraction ( e.g. @xcite ) , and some methods use it to determine an optimal frequency band when extracting the oscillation frequency of the fault feature @xcite .",
    "only a few very recent works use the temporal periodic structure to extract fault features @xcite .",
    "the overlapping group sparsity ( ogs ) approach has been discussed in @xcite , where a multi - dimensional group structure has been modeled in various domains and convex optimization problems have been formulated , to take advantage of group behavior ( e.g. coefficients in stft domain ) to recover signals from noisy observations . using ogs to extract fault features was introduced and formulated as an convex optimization problem in @xcite , in which the fault features are assumed to be a periodic sequence of pulses .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the objective function can be convex even if some specified non - convex penalty functions are used to promote sparsity . moreover ,",
    "when the periodicity information is known , a binary - weighted group structure was used in the regularization , capturing the period of the potential fault features .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the problem wherein the fault features are comprised of a sequence of oscillatory transients , and sparsity should be promoted in the time - frequency domain .",
    "the discrete - time vibration observation @xmath0 is modeled by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an approximately - periodic sequence of oscillatory transients where the period is determined by the characteristic frequency of potential faults , and @xmath3 is additive gaussian noise .",
    "moreover , we assume that the oscillation frequencies of the transient component @xmath2 are unknown but relatively sparse , and the periodicity is over the time domain .    under the signal model",
    ", we seek a solution to the optimization problem @xmath4 for the purpose of extracting the fault feature @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the coefficients corresponding to an overcomplete transform @xmath7 of @xmath2 , where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 0 is a regularization parameter and @xmath10 is a sparsity - promoting penalty function ( regularizer ) in the domain of @xmath6 .",
    "this paper aims to extract the oscillatory fault features as periodically structured groups of coefficients in the time - frequency domain .",
    "we set the operator @xmath7 to be the normalized inverse stft , and the function @xmath10 is customized to capture the periodicity in the stft domain .    to solve a relatively complicated sparsity - based optimization problem , where an iterative scheme has to be adopted ,",
    "methods are usually based on two algorithms .",
    "one is based on majorization - minimization ( mm ) @xcite , such as the algorithms given in @xcite , and further the method of iterated soft - thresholding algorithm ( ista ) @xcite can be considered as a special case of mm asa well ( majorizing data fidelity term based on lipschitz constant ) .",
    "another trend is based on alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) @xcite , and its extension such as split augmented lagrangian shrinkage algorithm ( salsa ) @xcite , and some recent applications using such algorithm are presented in @xcite .",
    "some algorithms can be explained as a combination of admm and mm as a special case .",
    "for instance , a specific function of bregman distance was described in @xcite , which is similar to a majorizer , utilized to derive an iterative method for total variation problem @xcite .",
    "such concept has been used on total variation problem with multiple extensions such as combinations with wavelet - based denoising , compressive sensing @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bregman distance function in @xcite was used to in other iterative algorithms for convex problems as well , such as the methods proposed in @xcite .",
    "some recent work in the field of optimization also consider this problem . in @xcite",
    ", a framework is given that instead of using the bregman distance function in @xcite , but using proper ` indefinite proximal terms ' to majorize augmented lagrangian , the resulting majorized admm - style algorithm will converge for convex problem .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , an admm - style algorithm with a embedded criteria checking step is proposed based on majorizing the corresponding augmented lagrangian as well .",
    "additionally , in @xcite , a scheme of majoring a cross term with the admm - style iteration is proposed for convex problem .    in this work ,",
    "we propose an algorithm that combines admm and mm with a more general and simpler formulation , based on block successive upper - bound minimization ( bsum ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "moreover , the algorithm allows non - convex regularization to promote the resulting sparsity , and it is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum even though the objective function is not convex .      in this paper ,",

    "this result shows that linear time - invariant ( lti ) filtering technique hardly recovers a zero baseline .",
    "moreover , although some transients with large amplitude can be visually distinguished in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_bp_x](a ) , it is hard to distinguish the transients with small amplitudes , e.g. , at about @xmath166 to @xmath167 second .",
    "furthermore , the result in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_bp_x](a ) is obtained by knowing the oscillatory frequencies exactly , but in practice , especially in the area of fault diagnosis , it is rarely possible . in this example , even though we use the accurate frequencies as prior - knowledge for the bandpass filters , the proposed method still attains a significantly better root - mean - square error ( rmse ) value .",
    "wavelet - based denoising has also been used to extracted fault features @xcite . in this example",
    ", we adopt a conventional wavelet - coefficient thresholding method to denoise the test signal .",
    "more specifically , a 5-scale undecimated wavelet transform @xcite with 3 vanishing moments is used , and the result is shown in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_bp_x](b ) . for denoising , we apply hard - thresholding and chose the threshold value by @xmath168-rule for each subband . in figure",
    "[ fig : fs_example_1_bp_x](b ) , although some large amplitude transients can be recovered at correct locations , they lose the oscillatory structure , where most recovered transients have irregular waveforms [ see the cropped example inside the dashed line box in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_bp_x](b ) ] . in the time range from about @xmath169 to @xmath170 seconds , the transients are almost completely diminished .    as an application of fault diagnosis ,",
    "we apply maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution ( mckd ) @xcite to the test data .",
    "this method deconvolves the signal from an estimated fir filter that maximizes the correlated kurtosis value locally .",
    "it requires the period of potential fault features . to proceed with the algorithm , we set the period length to be the true period ( 160 samples ) , and the fir filter length to be 100 , and the m - shift value to be 5 as suggested in the matlab implementation available online",
    ". the result of mckd is shown in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_mckd_x](a ) , where we found that the algorithm is not able to give a deconvolution result that properly indicates most of the fault features at the noise level of our test signal .",
    "when comparing to the noisy data in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_y](b ) , we can see the algorithm mistakenly promotes the impulsive features in noise .",
    "when we reduce the noise level , the algorithm is capable to properly indicate periodic fault features as promoted impulses after deconvolution . in figure",
    "[ fig : fs_example_1_mckd_x](b ) , we show an example of applying mckd to the data in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_y](b ) , but with a reduced noise level from @xmath171 to @xmath172 .",
    "non - convex penalty functions can be utilized to further enhance the effectiveness of our proposed formulation .",
    "when the objective function has a non - convex regularizer , the problem is generally non - convex , and when minimizing a non - convex function , the algorithm may get trapped in a local minima . to reduce this problem",
    ", we use the solution from the convex formulation to initialize the algorithm . through numerical experiments",

    "this range does not guarantee the problem is convex , but in practice , using the non - convex penalty regularizers in this range significantly enhances the result and gives a stable convergence behavior . to further reduce the problem of local minima",
    ", we can gradually increase the parameter @xmath173 to its maximum value .",
    "for instance , when the upper bound of @xmath173 is @xmath176 in , we can run the algorithm ( in table  [ alg : main ] ) starting with @xmath177 obtaining a result with convex penalty function , and then run the algorithm with non - convex penalty function five more times initialized by previous iteration , gradually increasing @xmath173 by @xmath178 each time .",
    "this simultaneously helps to restrict the non - convex solution close to the convex solution and promote stronger sparsity .",
    "in this example , we use the arctangent function ( ` atan ' in table  [ tab : etea_penalty ] ) , and the result is shown in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_x](a ) . there is a significant improvement reflected by the rmse value compared to the convex penalty function in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_cn_x ] . we also show the absolute value of stft coefficients in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_x](b ) , and the frequency component indication in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_x](c ) , where significant enhancement of sparsity can be seen . meanwhile , the hilbert envelope spectrum of estimated signals is illustrate in figure  [ fig : fs_example_1_x](d ) .",
    "the useful fault frequency and its harmonic components are clearly detected in the hilbert envelope spectrum .      * setting stft parameters . * setting stft parameters .",
    "to use the proposed method , we suggest choosing a relatively small window length because , assuming the length of the periodic transient is unknown , a short window length can preserve the resolution of the time - frequency spectrum .",
    "moreover , in order to promote the sparsity effectively , the transform a should be over - complete .",
    "we suggest choosing the length of the fft for each window ( the value l in the examples ) 4 or 8 times the window length ( the value r in the examples ) .",
    "if @xmath179 is too large , it will affect the computation efficiency .",
    "in all the tests and examples , we consistently used the stft with a squared - sine window with 50 % overlapping .    * setting binary weighting grid @xmath109 . * presumably , other than the information of periodicity , any other facts about the oscillatory feature is not given in the proposed method . consequently , as a lower limit of grouping scheme , we can chose the grid on the time - frequency domain adhering @xmath180 , so that a neighboring coefficients on both time and frequency domain are considered . moreover , the value of @xmath110 , which is the number spanning in @xmath109 , has no specific limits , and in all tests and examples , we consistently set the value of @xmath110 to 4 or 8 .    * setting regularization parameter @xmath181 . * based on signal model",
    ", we assume the noise ( excluding the periodic oscillatory transients ) is white noise .",
    "consequently , when the observation @xmath0 is noise only as @xmath3 , the solution of problemn should be almost all zero . in this case , if the variance of noise @xmath182 is known , a signal with only noise @xmath183 can be built , and the regularization parameter @xmath181 in can be trained by letting @xmath184 through when @xmath185 .",
    "it is well - known that in most signal denoising methods using sparsity - based optimization the regularization parameter is proportional to the noise level , wherein the heavier the noise is , the larger regularization parameter should be utilized . through numerical experiments",
    ", we found that for problem , the optimal lambda is an approximately linear function of @xmath186 .",
    "moreover , it is certain that when there is no noise in the observation signal , @xmath181 should be 0 , therefore other than building a noise signal to select @xmath181 for , alternatively it is only necessary to determine a factor @xmath187 and set @xmath188 . for guidance",
