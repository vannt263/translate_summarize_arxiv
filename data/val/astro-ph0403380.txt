    "rxj0720.43125 is a nearby , isolated neutron star ( ins ) originally discovered with _ rosat _ during a systematic survey of the galactic plane by haberl et al .",
    "a clear modulation of the x - ray intensity is detected at a period of 8.391 s , which identifies the spin velocity of the neutron star .",
    "rx j0720.43125 is , so far , the isolated neutron star with best studied timing properties .",
    "its proximity and relatively high brightness made possible not only to measure the spin period , but also to study the period changes over a long - term .",
    "this is crucial , since the positive detection of spin - up or spin - down phases can shed light on the mechanisms that regulate the neutron star interaction with its surroundings .",
    "a large positive spin - down can indicate magneto - dipolar breaking , leading in turn to an estimate of magnetic field strength and star spin down age . in the attempt to measure a secular period change , zane et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter z02 ) recently undertook a comprehensive timing analysis of _ rosat _ , _ bepposax _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data spanning a total period of @xmath4  yrs . independently , a similar analysis based on an additional _ chandra _ dataset , but without the _ xmm - newton _ data , was presented by kaplan et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter k02 ) .",
    "although the two studies agreed in their main conclusion that the period change was less than @xmath5 s / s , it was evident that there were inconsistencies in the details of the analysis which have implications for further studies .",
    "the arrival times computed by the two groups were different .",
    "k02 also raised theoretical concerns about the validity of the _ coherent _ analysis of the entire dataset carried out by z02 .",
    "that was the only method that , at that time , permitted the ( positive ) sign of the period change to be constrained .",
    "in fact , the phase - incoherent analysis presented by kaplan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) still leads to a large uncertainty in @xmath6 , and does not permit the discrimination between positive and negative spin - down .",
    "the above - mentioned inconsistencies have motivated us to undertake a complete revision of the solution . at the time",
    "z02 was published , timing inconsistencies between _ xmm - newton _ and radio data on other pulsars had come to light ( kuster et al .",
    "this was traced to an error in the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) task _ barycen _ before version 13.1 [ the spacecraft position vector was constructed as ( x , y , y ) instead of ( x , y , z ) ] .",
    "although we argued in z02 that any effect on the coherent analysis was small , we nevertheless performed a reanalysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data to check , and also to investigate whether this corrected the inconsistencies with the k02 analysis .",
    "we found indeed that the effect was negligible .",
    "the implication is therefore that the inconsistencies between the z02 and k02 analyses remained .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a complete reanalysis of the dataset to investigate and eliminate these inconsistencies .",
    "this has brought to light that the times used for the _ rosat _ data in both the z02 and k02 studies are in utc rather than tdb as used for _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ; the times of arrival ( toas ) in k02 are incorrectly calculated ; and that the formula used to calculate the instantaneous phase was incorrect in z02 .",
    "substantial new datasets are also available from both _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ which permit a more comprehensive investigation into the period evolution .",
    "we report here the results of this reanalysis .",
    "we refer the reader to z02 and k02 for the details of the previous observations , and comment here largely only on those aspects which have changed .",
    "the table of observations is given in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",

    "as we can see , the only scenario compatible with a superstrong field at the star s birth ( @xmath7  g ) is that one involving a very fast decay , i.e. the hall cascade . in this case",
    "the predicted star s age is @xmath8  yr . although such a young age is only marginally compatible with the absence of a remnant , it is not incompatible with that inferred from the cooling curves ( see figure [ fig : cooling ] ) provided the mass is slightly larger . a slightly larger mass still is required if we allow for the extra - heating due to @xmath9-decay from hall cascade ( geppert & colpi , private communication ) .",
    "on the other hand , both mechanisms involving ambipolar diffusion predict a magnetic field which is relatively constant over the source lifetime and close to the present value .",
    "the corresponding star s age is between @xmath10  yr and @xmath11  yr , and is close to @xmath12 .",
    "we have eliminated the discrepancies between the calculated toas in the k02 paper and those derived from the same data analysed by z02 .",
    "this invalidated our derived @xmath13 $ ] solutions in z02 ( k02 have also updated their toas ) . in order to correct these solutions ,",
    "we have reanalysed the datasets and taken the opportunity to incorporate significant new datasets from both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. at the same time , we have revised the model used by z02 to be fitted to the data to retain the correct phase reference .    taken individually ,",
    "the combination of old and new datasets allow a significantly more accurate @xmath13 $ ] solution to be derived than that in k02 or z02 .",
    "this _ establishes that rx j0720.43125 is spinning down_.    we have also attempted a phase - coherent analysis of the combined datasets , as in z02 .",
    "however , we have been unable to find a consistent solution , even when we analyse the data from different satellites separately . in this case",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data are not consistent with the other data .",
    "we have explored the possible reasons for this : they may be intrinsic to rx j0720.43125 ( in which case the constant @xmath6 model is not appropriate ) , or they may result from continuing timing errors in the data we have not succeeded in identifying .",
    "we present the solutions from the combined _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ data and the _ xmm - newton _ data separately .",
    "the individual ( incoherent ) @xmath13 $ ] solution is sufficiently accurate to allows us to place strong constraints on the mechanism causing the spin - down .",
    "the large @xmath14  s / s rules out accretion and propeller origins and points toward an interpretation in terms of magneto - dipolar breaking .",
    "this in turn constrains the age of rx j0720.43125 and its magnetic field strength .    for a magnetic field as strong as @xmath15  g",
    ", the electron cyclotron line is unaccessible ( it falls at about 350 kev ) .",
    "however , a relatively broad proton cyclotron absorption feature is predicted at @xmath16  kev ( zane et al . ,  2001 ) .",
    "the presence of a cyclotron absorption line at the low energy of the sensitive energy band of the _ xmm - newton _ epic instruments has been indeed recently reported ( see haberl et al . ,  2003a , 2004 ) .",
    "the feature may explain the observed deviations from a planckian shape at these energies , and possibly also the anticorrelation of the modulation of hardness ratio and total x - ray intensity detected by _ xmm - newton _",
    "( cropper et al . ,  2001 ) .",
    "our study allows a possible evolutionary link between dim ins and axps ( which relies on the interpretation of the former as warm - out magnetars ) but only if the ins have an age of @xmath1 yr .",
    "a more conservative interpretation is that rx j0720.43125 was born with a strong , but not superstrong , field [ @xmath17  g ] which is compatible with those of the canonical radio - pulsars .",
    "similar conclusions have been argued also by k02 , however their measure of @xmath6 has a large error and does not permit the discrimination between this and the separate possibilities that rx j0720.43125 has a more conventional field ( @xmath18  g ) and lower spin - down rate ( @xmath19s / s ) or is even spinning - up . comparing with the radio - active pulsar population , objects with @xmath20  g are rare , but their evidence is rapidly growing ( camilo et al .",
    ",  2000 ) .",
    "the parameters of rx j0720.43125 we have derived are not too dissimilar from those of psr  j18141744 , which has @xmath21  s and @xmath22  s / s .",
    "one of the most striking mysteries about _ rosat _ isolated neutron stars , axps , soft-@xmath23 repeaters and objects like geminga is why they do not exhibit radio emission . as suggested by motch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who derived very similar conclusions basing on the proper motion measurement , it could thus be that rx j0720.43125 and several others apparently radio - quiet neutron stars are just radio pulsars with off - axis beam that does not cross the earth . the radio beam narrows with increasing periods ( briggs 1990 ) , making this explanation even more plausible .",
    "on the other hand , evidence for a population of genuinely radio - silent young neutron stars arises from population synthesis ( neuhuser & trmper ,  1999 ; gotthelf & vasisht , 2000 ; popov et al . ,  2000a , b and references therein ) .",
    "the group of rosat inss is very homogeneous and they are all relatively close - by ( within 300 - 400 pc ) , making unplausible that all their beams are misaligned . at present , these two possibilities can not be distinguished .",
    "detailed timing analysis of other _ rosat _ inss is crucial to reach a more comprehensive understanding of the entire population .",
    "we are grateful to uwe lammers for his reprocessing of the _ xmm - newton _ odfs .",
    "we thank david kaplan for several discussions regarding the toas and for pointing out the difference between the event timings in his and our bepposax data .",
    "we thank marco feroci for processing the bepposax data , and tim oosterbroek and gianluca israel for providing information on the intricacies of the time correction in the sax das .",
    "we also thank werner becker for his insights into the possible sources of error in the _ xmm - newton _ timing .",
