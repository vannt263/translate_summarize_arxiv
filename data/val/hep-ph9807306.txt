    "in a previous paper @xcite we have addressed the question of a possible energy - dependence of the solar - neutrino deficit coming to the conclusion that , at least for the time being , its existence must be regarded only as an attractive possibility and by no means as an established reality .",
    "our analysis was based on the comparison between the existing experimental data @xcite and the theoretical predictions , assumed to be well represented by those of the `` reference model '' of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the latter assumption is actually rather questionable .",
    "there exist in fact several solar models capable of reproducing all experimentally known facts but giving rise to somewhat different neutrino flux predictions @xcite . as different models of the same sun can not be all simultaneously right , it follows that theoretical predictions can only be said to be known within indeterminations which are actually larger than those associated with the results of any single model .    in our previous analysis",
    "@xcite we mentioned this effect but did not take it into account . in this paper , we try to quantify this additional theoretical uncertainty by looking at the spread of the various predictions .",
    "the procedure adopted is described in section 2 . with modified theoretical predictions and their errors , the statistical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite is then repeated in section 3 .",
    "section 4 summarises our conclusions .",
    "an extensive review of solar models is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . we have restricted ourselves to `` standard '' models , i.e. to those capable of reproducing all solar observational results , including the helioseismology data .",
    "the solar neutrino event rates for the gallium ( ga ) , clorine ( cl ) and kamiokande ( ka ) experiments predicted by the four considered models @xcite are reported in table 1 . within each model ,",
    "the quoted errors reflect the uncertainties on the input parameters .",
    "these errors are highly correlated .",
    "however , it is only for the model of ref .",
    "@xcite that the error correlation matrix is readily available @xcite .",
    "consequently , we have taken the errors of this model to be typical of and to apply to all this type of calculations .",
    ".solar neutrino event rates for the clorine ( cl ) , gallium ( ga ) and kamiokande ( ka ) experiments predicted by the four `` standard '' models . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     following ref .",
    "@xcite , the hypothesis of an energy - independent depletion of the solar @xmath0 flux due to oscillations is tested by studying the function    @xmath1    where :    * f is the common factor by which all calculated @xmath0 fluxes are reduced ; * the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 run over the three ( ga , cl and ka ) experiments ; * @xmath4 are the experimental results ; * @xmath5 are the theoretical predictions",
    ". they are obtained from the @xmath6 of table 2 through the relations @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fraction of the kamiokande detection efficiency due to flavour - blind neutral currents ; * s is the covariance matrix obtained from that of table 2 by multiplying the elements @xmath9 with @xmath10 by @xmath11 , those with either @xmath2 or @xmath12 by @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 by @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] and by adding in quadrature the experimental errors to the diagonal elements .",
    "we have at first replaced all asymmetric errors by their average values . with this procedure ,",
    "the @xmath16 analysis yields @xmath17 with @xmath18 corresponding to a confidence level ( c.l . ) of 1.7 @xmath19 .    for comparison , if the theoretical predictions and their covariance matrix are taken from the model of ref .",
    "[ 6 ] alone , one obtains @xmath20 with @xmath21 corresponding to a c.l .",
    "of 0.072 % .    to test the sensitivity of these results to the procedure adopted in treating the errors ,",
    "we have introduced a modification . in all operations involving two quantities ( weighted averages of the two ga and ka results and evaluations of the @xmath16 terms )",
    "we have used the positive ( negative ) error on the first and the negative ( positive ) error on the second if the first quantity was smaller ( larger ) than the second . in this case",
    "the results are @xmath22 with @xmath23 corresponding to a c.l . of 2.2 % .",
    "the results obtained by using the second procedure are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in each plane",
    "the two ellipses are the projections of the volumes in which the points representing respectively the experimental and calculated rates lie with 68.27 % probability .",
    "although not unacceptably low , the confidence level for an energy - independent depletion of the solar @xmath0 flux due to oscillations obtained using the results of the model of ref .",
    "[ 6 ] is admittedly rather marginal .    in the analysis presented in this paper",
    "we have used the average values of the predictions of four models introducing also additional few - percent uncertainties on them due to their spread .",
    "the confidence levels obtained are remarkably good .    in conclusion , for the time being",
    ", oscillation solutions of the solar neutrino problem based on an energy modulation of the solar neutrino deficit must be considered as perhaps suggested but certainly not compelled by the data .",
