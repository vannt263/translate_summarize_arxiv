    "in particular , the thermodynamic properties of hot dense plasmas are essential for the description of plasmas generated by strong lasers @xcite .",
    "further , among the phenomena of current interest are the high - pressure compressibility of deuterium @xcite , metallization of hydrogen @xcite , plasma phase transition etc . , which occur in situations where both _ interaction and quantum effects _ are relevant .",

    "@xcite , as well as to some earlier investigations of one of us @xcite . among the early simulation approaches",
    "we refer to several monte carlo ( mc ) calculations , e.g. @xcite",
    ". there has been significant progress in recent years in studying these systems analytically and numerically , see e.g. @xcite for an overview .",
    "however , there remains an urgent need to test analytical models by an independent numerical approach .",
    "besides the molecular dynamics approach , e.g. @xcite , the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method is particularly well suited to describe thermodynamic properties in the region of high density .",
    "this is because it starts from the fundamental plasma particles - electrons and ions , ( physical picture ) and treats all interactions , including bound state formation , rigorously and selfconsistently .",
    "we notice remarkable recent progress in applying these techniques to fermi systems , for an overview see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "several methods have been developed to perform quantum mc .",
    "first we mention the restricted pimc method @xcite ; here special assumptions on the density operator @xmath1 are introduced in order to reduce the sum over permutations to even ( positive ) contributions only .",
    "it can be shown , however , that this method does not reproduce the correct ideal fermi gas limit @xcite .",
    "an alternative are direct fermionic pimc simulations which have occasionally been attempted by various groups .",
    "recently , three of us have proposed a new path integral representation for the n - particle density operator @xcite which allows for _ direct fermionic path integral monte carlo _ simulations of dense plasmas in a wide range of densities and temperatures . using this concept , the pressure and energy of a degenerate strongly coupled hydrogen plasma",
    "have been computed @xcite as well as the pair distribution functions in the region of partial ionization and dissociation @xcite .",
    "this scheme is rather efficient when the number of time slices ( beads ) in the path integral is less or equal 50 and was found to work well for temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "one difficulty of pimc simulations is that reliable error estimates are often not available , in particular for strongly coupled degenerate systems . here",
    ", we will make a comparison with two independent analytical methods .",
    "the first is the method of an effective ion - ion interaction potential ( eiip ) which has previously been developed for application to simple solid and liquid metals @xcite and which is here , for the first time adopted to dense hydrogen .",
    "the second is the method of pad approximations in combination with saha equations , i.e. the chemical picture ( pach ) @xcite .",
    "the pad formulas are constructed on the basis of the known analytical limits of low density @xcite and high density @xcite , and they are exact up to quadratic terms in the density , interpolating between the virial expansions and the high - density asymptotics @xcite .",
    "we will show here that both methods , eiip and pach provide results for the internal energy which agree well with each other at high densities where the electrons are strongly degenerate and no bound states exist , approximately for @xmath3@xmath4 . in this region",
    ", there is also good agreement with recent density functional results @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the pimc results is very good below @xmath5@xmath4 . for intermediate densities , where the degree of ionization changes strongly ,",
    "we observe deviations .",
    "also , at high densities , the pimc results , tend to lower energies than the analytical approaches .",
    "finally , they reveal several interesting effects , such as the formation of clusters and the onset of ion crystallization .",
    "let us study a hydrogen plasma consisting of @xmath6 electrons and @xmath7 protons ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the total proton ( atom ) density is @xmath9 .",
    "the average distance between the electrons is the wigner - seitz radius @xmath10^{1/3}$ ] , and other characteristic lengths are the bohr radius @xmath11 , the landau length @xmath12 and the de broglie wave length @xmath13^{1/2}$ ] of the electrons .",
    "the degeneracy parameter is @xmath14 .",
    "we define the dimensionless temperature @xmath15 which , in the considered below temperature interval , varies between @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the wigner - seitz parameter @xmath17 and the dimensionless classical coupling strength @xmath18 .",
    "hydrogen is anti - symmetric with respect to the charges ( @xmath19 ) and symmetric with respect to the densities ( @xmath20 ) and , due to the big mass difference , @xmath21 , ions and electrons behave quite differently . at the considered temperatures ,",
    "the ions may be treated classically as long as @xmath22 @xmath4 .",
    "further , for these temperatures and densities , the proton coupling parameter is in the range @xmath23 , i.e. we expect strong coupling effects .",
    "we study in this work the internal energies of the fluid hydrogen system and start with providing some simple estimates for guidance . in the following",
    "we will give all energies in rydberg units .",
    "first , at very low densities the electrons and the protons behave like an ideal boltzmann gas .",
    "therefore , the energy per proton ( of free electrons and protons ) is given by ( in rydberg units ) @xmath24 in other words the low - density limit is , in our temperature interval , a positive number in the region @xmath25 .",
    "with increasing density we expect a region where atoms and , possibly also a few molecules , are formed @xcite . in the region of atoms",
    "a lower bound for the energy per proton is @xmath26 where the last term represents the binding energy @xmath27 of h - atoms .",
    "if molecules are formed , the corresponding estimate per proton is still lower @xmath28    generally , the existence of a lower bound for the energy per proton was proven by dyson and lenard @xcite and lieb and thirring @xcite @xmath29 where the best estimate known to us ( which certainly is much too large ) , is @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we see that , with increasing density , the energy per proton tends to negative values and may reach a finite minimum .",
    "further density increase will cause the energy to increase again as a result of quantum degeneracy effcts .    in order to understand this increase",
    "let us look first at the limit of very high density ( still in the region where the protons are classical ) .",
    "then the first estimate of the energy is @xmath31 which is positive .",
    "the last term , representing the fermi energy of the electrons , is strongly increasing with density ( with power @xmath32 ) . in the next approximation according to wigner s estimate we have to take into account the hartree contribution to the electron energy and a corresponding estimate for the proton energy .",
    "the proton energy is estimated under the assumption that protons form a lattice . this way we find",
    "the estimate @xmath33 the two corrections that were added to eq .",
    "( [ fermi ] ) are both negative and scale like @xmath34 . in other words , these interaction terms might play a major role with decreasing density . at a critical density",
    "the energy per proton may become negative .",
    "this densitiy can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ estimate ] ) by solving the quadratic equation @xmath35 perturbatively , starting with the zero temperature limit , and adding the first ( linear in @xmath36 ) correction , @xmath37 this result coincides , for @xmath38 , with wigner s criterion for the existence of molecules : for @xmath39 , molecules can not exist since there is no room for forming bound state wave functions . according to eq .",
    "( [ rs0 ] ) , for finite temperature , molecules exist only for still larger @xmath40 as thermal fluctuations increase the wave function overlap . more generally , with increasing temperature , the energy becomes positive at lower density compared to the case @xmath41 .",
    "summarizing the qualitative results obtained in this section we may state that we expect , in the given temperature range , the following general behavior of the internal energy per proton : at zero density the energy starts with the ideal gas expression which depends only on the temperature . with increasing density the energy per proton becomes negative due to correlation effects ( bound states , electron correlations , proton correlations ) .",
    "a minimum is formed and at a density where the proton density is close to the inverse bohr radius cubed the energy per proton turns to positive values and is more and more determined by the ideal electron energy increasing with @xmath32 , corrected by correlation contributions of order @xmath34 which are determined by the hartree term and by proton - proton coupling effects . in the following we will show that this qualitative picture is supported by the results of our calculations .",
    "it is well known that in plasmas and plasma - like systems , in a broad parameter range , the interaction between the electron and ion subsystems is weak , whereas the interacrtions within the electron and ion subsystems can be strong .",
    "the corresponding small parameter is the ratio @xmath42 of the characteristic value of electron ",
    "ion interaction @xmath43 to the electron fermi energy @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the mentioned approximation is valid for systems with degenerate electrons , if @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the electron and ion temperatures respectively ( below we will consider the case @xmath48 ) .",
    "typical systems for which this approximation is fulfilled are simple solid and liquid metals and non - transitional metals in general , and this approximation serves as the basis for the computation of thermodynamic and electron kinetic properties , e.g. @xcite .    for simple metals",
    "the fermi energy is not very large compared to the characteristic electron ",
    "ion coulomb interaction , taken at the average interparticle distance .",
    "however , due to the orthogonality of the wave functions for the conduction electrons and electrons bound in the ion shells , there is a partial compensation of the electron ",
    "ion coulomb attraction at small distances which effectively weakens the electron  ion interaction .",
    "this fact is described in the theory of simple metals in the framework of the so called pseudopotential theory .",
    "the calculation of the pseudopotential is , in general , a complicated problem in particular due to its non - local structure @xcite . for practical applications",
    "it can be represented approximately as a local interaction with one or two fitting parameters for each metal .",
    "on basis of the pseudopotential theory all thermodynamic properties and electronic kinetic coefficients can be calculated with sufficiently high accuracy for a wide range of temperatures and pressures .",
    "naturally , these calculations require reliable knowledge of the properties of the two quasi ",
    "independent subsystems : the degenerate electron liquid on the positive charge background and the classical ion subsystem with some effective strong inter - ion interaction .",
    "it is apparent that there is also a wide range of parameters for highly ionized strongly compressed hydrogen plasmas , where the electron ",
    "ion interaction is weak . for these parameters",
    "the complicated problem of calculating the properties of a strongly coupled quantum electron ",
    "proton system can be essentially simplified . in so doing , the results obtained for high compression ( when no bound electron states  hydrogen atoms and molecules  are existing ) ,",
    "do not require any fitting , in contrast to the case of simple metals , because the inter ",
    "ion potential for hydrogen is pure coulomb .",
    "therefore , the data obtained with this analytical approximation , can be considered as an reliable basis for comparison with the results of alternative approaches , including analytical and simulation methods for degenerate quantum systems of fermi particles .",
    "the results of this pseudopotential approach are especially important for conditions of extreme compression where the plasma is characterized by strong interaction within the electron and , especially , the ion subsystem . for these difficult situations experimental data",
    "are still missing whereas new acurate numerical methods for fermi system are only emerging .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of an electron ",
    "proton plasma , for which the terms with infinite zero - components of the potentials are canceled , due to quasineutrality ( for generality we retain the charge number @xmath49 of the ions ) : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the energy of the electron with momentum @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the fourier - component of the electron ",
    "proton interaction potential . for the electron degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian",

    "( [ eq3.1 ] ) @xmath58 denotes the coordinate of the i - th ion . to calculate the plasma energy , as in the theory of simple metals @xcite",
    ", two main approximations have to be used .",
    "the first is the adiabatic approximation for the ion motion , which is slow compared to the electron one .",
    "the second is the smallness of the ratio of the characteristic electron ",
    "proton coulomb interaction to the fermi energy @xmath44 .",
    "the respective parameter is @xmath59 .",
    "calculation of the electron energy in the external field of the immobile ions ( protons ) leads to the energy of the plasma given as function of the ion coordinates @xmath60 . in general ,",
    "the perturbation theory in terms of the parameter @xmath61 gives rise not only to pair but , naturally , also to higher order ion  ion interactions , which are rather complicated .",
    "to second order of perturbation theory in the parameter @xmath61 the energy per one electron of a plasma with a fixed proton configuration @xmath62 is easily written ,    @xmath63    here @xmath64 is the energy ( per ion ) of the _ correlated electron liquid _ on the homogeneous positive charge background .",
    "the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are , respectively , the static polarization function and the static dielectric function of the correlated electron liquid .",
    "these functions are related to one another by the usual equality :    @xmath67    the fourier - component of the effective pair interaction potential between the ions , @xmath68 , which appears in ( [ eq3.2 ] ) has the form :    @xmath69    in the following , we will concentrate on hydrogen and set @xmath70 leading to the effective proton - proton interaction @xmath71    it is clear that , in contrast to liquid metals , where the presence of the pseudopotential leads to a more complicated structure of the effective potential , in a dense hydrogen plasma , the effective potential is determined only by electron screening . as it was shown in @xcite for liquid metals , the additional pair interaction , arising from third and fourth order terms in the expansion of the electron energy in terms of the pseudopotential can play an important role in the effective interaction . for the effective potential of a hydrogen plasma a recent detailed analysis of these terms @xcite showed that these terms are essential only for rather rarified plasma conditions ( @xmath72 ) , and they are practically negligible for higher densities , @xmath73 , which we are considering in this paper . in fact , for @xmath74 , the structure of the effective ion - ion potential in hydrogen changes drastically and",

    "[ et50].a , ( see also ref .",
    "the reason for the low energies observed in our pimc simulations at @xmath198k are finite size effects : the homogeneous plasma state is unstable in the density region of the energy minimum .",
    "an analysis of the electron - proton configurations reveals that the plasma gains energy by forming small droplets @xcite which is a direct indication for a first order phase transition as discussed in the introduction .",
    "these effects begin to appear in the weakly ionized plasma and are not contained in the present variants of the pach and eiip methods although they have been analyzed before @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that xu and hansen @xcite observed strong fluctuations in their density functional calculations below @xmath202 which strongly resembled precursors of a phase transition . to clearify this interesting issue",
    "more in detail requires extensive simulations which are presently under way .    for completeness ,",
    "we mention further effects which tend to lower the total energy and which are neglected in the analytical approaches : increased electron polarization and nonadditive terms in the efficient proton - proton interaction which were analyzed by kagan and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the next interesting feature of the pimc simulations is the shift of the energy growth to higher density values compared to the analytical models .",
    "this tendency becomes stronger with increasing temperature , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ et10][et50 ] .",
    "there is no reason to doubt that the analytical methods ( in accord with the density functional results ) yield the correct energy asymptotics of a macroscopic electron - proton plasma at very high densities .",
    "( account of proton degeneracy effects which are not included would only further increase the energies . ) as noted above , our direct pimc simulations become increasingly difficult with growing electron degeneracy , so we expect the results to become less accurate for densities exceeding @xmath195@xmath4 .    however , the most important effect results again from the finite - size character of our simulations . to better understand the high - density results , we analyze in fig .  [ cp ] the electron - electron ( e - e ) , proton - proton ( p - p ) and electron - proton ( e - p ) pair distribution functions . these functions exhibit features typical for strongly correlated systems .",
    "the most prominent effect is seen in the p - p function which exhibits a periodic structure at @xmath200k which is even more pronounced at @xmath198k .",
    "this proton ordering is typical for a strongly correlated ion fluid which is near the crystallization temperature @xcite .",
    "our simulations for still higher densities show the formation of an ionic lattice immersed into a delocalized sea of electrons , i.e. an ionic wigner crystal as it is known to exist in high density objects such as white or brown dwarf stars .",
    "thus , qualitatively , the simulations show the correct behavior at high densities .",
    "but due to the small size of the simulations ( only 50 electrons and protons are presently feasible ) , the results are much closer to those for small ionic clusters which are known to exhibit quite peculiar behavior , including strong size dependence of the energy , negative specific heat etc . therefore , in order to obtain more accurate data for the internal energy of a macroscopic two - component plasma at ultrahigh compression , a significant increase of the simulation size is desirable which should become feasible in the near future .",
    "this work is devoted to the investigation of the thermodynamic properties of hot dense plasmas in the temperature region between @xmath203 and @xmath117k .",
    "we presented a new theoretical approach to high - density plasmas which is based on the theory of an effective ion - ion potential ( eiip ) .",
    "this method is shown to be quite efficient for fully ionized strongly correlated plasmas above the mott density .",
    "furthermore , a detailed comparison of several theoretical approaches on one hand and simulations on the other , has been performed over a wide density range .",
    "the first include the analytical models eeip and the pach on one hand and recent density functional data of xu and hansen @xcite on the other hand .",

    "we conclude that the three theoretical approaches are in very good agreement with each other for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma in the high density region where @xmath204 . on the other hand ,",
    "the two simulations agree with each other for temperatures above @xmath117k although no rpimc data for high densities are yet available to us .",
    "this agreement over a broad range of parameters is certainly remarkable since the plasma is far outside the perturbative regime : it is strongly correlated and the electrons are degenerate . moreover , all considered methods are essentially independent .",
    "finally , the comparison of our pimc simulation results with the analytical data reveals an overall good agreement , although deviations are observed above @xmath205@xmath4 .",
    "the simulation energy reaches a far deeper minimum and the energy increase due to electron degeneracy appears at higher densities .",
    "the discrepancy at lower densities ( below @xmath206@xmath4 ) was attributed to not adequate treatment of bound state effects in the analytical methods , whereas the deviations at higher density are most likely due to finite size effects encountered by the simulations .",
