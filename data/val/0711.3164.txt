    "second , since entanglement entropy for excited state scales as a lower power of area it is plausible that when a generic state ( consisting of a superposition of ground state and excited state ) is considered , corrections to the bekenstein - hawking entropy will emerge . in order to determine which one is correct ,",
    "it is imperative to investigate various generalizations of the scenarios considered in ref .",

    "( [ fig:5 ] ) , we have obtained the best numerical fit for the relative entropy . from these",
    ", we see that the entanglement entropy of the superposed state is given by : s = c_1 a (1 + ) where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are constants .",
    "this is the main result of this paper and we would like to stress the following points : ( i ) the second term in the above expression may be regarded as a power law correction to the area law , resulting from entanglement , when the wave - function of the field is chosen to be a superposition of ground and excited states .",
    "( ii ) it is important to note that the correction term falls off rapidly with @xmath46 ( due to the negative exponent ) and in the large area limit ( @xmath47 ) the area - law is recovered .",
    "this lends further credence to entanglement as a possible source of black hole entropy .",
    "( iii ) the correction term is more significant for greater excited state - ground state mixing proportion @xmath43 . for detailed discussion see refs .",
    "in this work , we have obtained power - law corrections to the bekenstein - hawking entropy , treating the entanglement between scalar field degrees of freedom inside and outside the horizon as a viable source of black - hole entropy .",
    "we have shown that for small black hole areas the area law is violated when the oscillator modes are in a linear superposition of ground and excited states .",
    "we found that the corrections to the area - law become increasingly significant as the proportion of excited states in the superposed state increases .",
    "conversely , for large horizon areas , these corrections are relatively small and the area - law is recovered .",
    "power law corrections to the bekenstein- hawking entropy has been encountered earlier in other approaches to black hole entropy .",
    "for instance , the noether charge approach predicts a generic power law correction to the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite .",

    "gb^5d = d^5 x [r + _ gb (r^2 - 4 r_ab r^ab + r_abcd r^abcd ) ] _ gb , that the entropy corresponding to a killing horizon is @xcite s__nc^5d = (1 + ) .",
    "although both these approaches lead to power - law corrections , there are couple of crucial differences between the two : ( i ) in the case of noether charge , the power - law corrections to the bekenstein - hawking entropy arises due to the higher - derivative terms in the gravity action . however , the corrections we have derived is also valid for einstein - hilbert action .",
    "( ii ) the noether charge entropy does not identify which degrees of freedom contribute most to the entropy . in our case",
    ", we have shown that the maximum entropy contribution for the area - law come close to the horizon while significant contribution to the power - law corrections arise from the degrees of freedom far from the horizon @xcite .",
    "ss is supported by the marie curie incoming international grant iif-2006 - 039205 .",
    "in this section , we generalize the framework of our calculations , so that they are applicable to black hole space - times .",
    "we start with the schwarzschild metric with a horizon at @xmath48 : ds^2 = -f(r ) dt^2 + + r^2 d^2  ,  f(r)= 1 - and define the following coordinate transformation from @xmath49 to @xmath50 coordinates : =",

    "the hamiltonian for a free scalar field in the above space - time can be written as : .",
    "for generalization see ref .",
    "next , choose a _ fixed _ lemaitre time , say @xmath51 and perform the following field redefinitions : ( r ) = _ 1(r )  ,  ( r ) =  . then , at that _ fixed time _ , the hamiltonian ( [ schham ] ) transforms to : h(0 ) = _ 0^dr  .",
