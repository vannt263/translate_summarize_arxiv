    "in exploring the possible space of allowed modifications to general relativity ( gr ) , one of the most stringent constraints is provided by precision tests within the solar system , which agree with gr to a high degree @xcite .",
    "if one is interested , for example , in infrared modifications of gr , in which late - time cosmic acceleration may be addressed , then one must satisfy these constraints while simultaneously seeking dynamics that depart strongly from gr on large scales .",
    "thus , a viable modified gravity theory which explains cosmic acceleration is expected to display a _ screening _ mechanism that results in the behavior of the theory in high - density regions differing significantly from that on cosmological scales , where densities are relatively low .    in this paper",
    "we wish to initiate the analytic study of long range forces mediated by galileons , a class of scalar particles appearing in various attempts to modify gravity at large distances and exhibiting what is known as the vainshtein screening mechanism .",
    "( see @xcite for the derivation of the action used here and @xcite-@xcite for discussion of the vainshtein screening mechanism .",
    "also see @xcite for numerical work on the static vainshtein - screened 2-body problem . )",
    "possible astrophysical tests of galileon theories are discussed in @xcite-@xcite , and the theory and its many extensions @xcite-@xcite have been of particular interest due to their cosmological consequences .",
    "the primary hurdle to understanding both gravitational and vainshtein screened forces is the presence of the nonlinear graviton and galileon self - interactions . in gr ,",
    "gravitational forces within the solar system can not be computed exactly but they can be treated perturbatively , because the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath0 written in a weakly curved spacetime @xmath1 is a series taking the schematic form @xmath2 .",
    "( that is , higher nonlinearities contain exactly two derivatives but higher powers of @xmath3 . )",
    "to lowest order , @xmath3 scales as the typical newtonian potential @xmath4 generated by the masses in the solar system , where @xmath5 is newton s constant , @xmath6 is a typical mass and @xmath7 is the distance from the mass .",
    "thus , each increasing order in nonlinearity scales as @xmath8 , and is hence a small perturbation relative to the previous order .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9(distance ) form of the newtonian potential , and its nonlinear ( and relativistic ) corrections , is valid for any separation distance from a massive body within the solar system . in gr",
    "it is the schwarzschild radius of the mass in question ( when @xmath10 ) that characterizes when nonlinearities will dominate the dynamics . even for the sun , the most massive object in our solar system ,",
    "its schwarzschild radius is a mere 3 km while its physical radius is @xmath11 km .",
    "however , because the mass scale @xmath12 associated with the nonlinear self - interactions of galileons @xmath13 is much smaller than the mass scale @xmath14 associated with gravitational interactions , the force law produced by galileons does not remain the same for all relevant separation distances . to see this",
    ", we first note that the galileon lagrangian written in flat spacetime takes the schematic form @xmath15 where the degree of nonlinearity is measured by the powers of @xmath16 in a given term .",
    "galileons couple to the trace of the stress - energy of matter , with an interaction lagrangian @xmath17 . for an isolated static body of mass @xmath18",
    ", we may define @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the vainshtein radius of the object . far away from @xmath18",
    "the galileon potential is the familiar @xmath21 form .",
    "however , when one gets closer to the source @xmath18 than @xmath22 ",
    "i.e. once @xmath23  the nonlinearities will begin to dominate the dynamics . typically , for galileons to be relevant cosmologically , @xmath24 km ( @xmath25 is the current hubble parameter ) .",
    "this means the sun s vainshtein radius @xmath26 light years and solar system dynamics takes place deep within the nonlinear regime of the sun s ( hypothetical ) galileon field .",
    "furthermore , the solar system is a multi - body system ; to develop a quantitative understanding of its dynamics it is also necessary to compute self - consistently the galileon forces exerted by the rest of the planetary bodies in the presence of the sun .",
    "for instance , properly calculating the earth - moon galileon force is important if one wishes to use precision lunar laser ranging measurements to constrain the galileon s existence .    in this work , we approximate the sun and its planetary companions as point masses and assume that the solar system is held together primarily by weak field gravity described by gr ",
    "we will assume galileon forces are subdominant .",
    "we will focus only on the modification of solar system dynamics due to galileons , and thus attempt to solve the galileon theory in exactly flat spacetime .",
    "this is justified as the interaction of galileons and gravity can be taken into account perturbatively , and we will show that these corrections are subdominant . however , we do not take into account the effects of cosmological boundary conditions as in @xcite .    to capture the effects of nonlinearities",
    "we will first solve the galileon field @xmath27 due to the sun .",
    "we proceed to solve for the static green s function of the galileon fluctuations about @xmath27 , and then use a field theoretic framework to examine the effective action of these point masses .",
    "this effective action framework is very similar in spirit to that developed in @xcite for the 2-body problem in gr ( and extended in @xcite to the @xmath28-body case ) .",
    "we will exploit the fact that the solar system is a non - relativistic system and therefore , to zeroth order , the galileon potential between two point masses @xmath29 is simply @xmath30 multiplied by the static green s function of the galileon wave equation linearized about @xmath27 .",
    "recently , in @xcite , this static potential was solved exactly for the purely cubic galileon theory . here , we will extend that work and find an exact solution for the maximally quartic galileon case . using these exact solutions",
    ", we will also demonstrate how one may compute the general galileon force law using the perturbation theory approach developed in @xcite .",
    "this paper will be organized as follows : in section  [ ss : background ] we introduce the galileon theory and discuss the galileon force sourced by the sun , including the resulting planetary perihelion precession . in section  [ ss : propagators ] we obtain the full static propagator for galileon interactions in the presence of a large central mass for both the minimum and maximum quartic interaction strengths allowed by stability requirements , and then extend these results to more generic parameter values using perturbation theory . in section",
    "[ ss : diagrams ] we explain the power counting of feynman diagrams in the field theoretic framework and present the resulting form for the effective action as an expansion in two small parameters . in section  [ ss : outsiderv ]",
    "we provide concrete results in the region outside the vainshtein radius of the large central source , followed in section  [ ss : breakdown ] by a discussion of why this calculation should not be trusted in the region inside the vainshtein radius .",
    "we discuss the results in section  [ s : discussion ] .",

    ". this choice is galilean - invariant in flat spacetime and for an external source ; away from these assumptions the galilean symmetry is broken but the theory is nevertheless interesting as the simplest realization of the vainshtein screening mechanism .",
    "another possible coupling which arises in the decoupling limit of massive gravity is the disformal coupling @xmath40 .",
    "this coupling is parametrically smaller than the coupling to the trace of the stress - energy tensor so long as the galileon is sub - planckian and quantum corrections to the galileon terms are irrelevant ( @xmath41 @xcite ) : @xmath42 the disformal coupling is not only higher order , it is also zero in the case of a static , nonrelativistic source such as we consider here . as discussed in @xcite , however , this coupling is important for lensing calculations ( for which the lowest - order coupling is zero ) .",
    "we consider as matter a collection of point particles whose motion is left arbitrary , aside from a large central mass @xmath43 which is pinned at the origin : @xmath44 via the standard definition @xmath45 the trace of the stress - energy tensor to which the galileon couples is @xmath46    _ strategy _ our approach to understanding galileon forces between well separated bodies lying deep within the vainshtein radius of the central mass @xmath47 is as follows .",

    "strictly speaking , to probe the dynamical content of our scalar equation linearized about @xmath48 , one would need to solve the full time dependent retarded green s function @xmath77 .",
    "however , this is not an easy task .",
    "therefore , because we are interested primarily in the forces between planetary bodies moving at speeds much less than unity ( relative to the solar system s center of energy ) , we shall in this paper seek its static limit , @xmath78    before proceeding , let us observe from that the quintic galileon self - interactions do not contribute to the background field @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , as discussed in @xcite , any time - independent galileon @xmath13 trivially satisfies the portion of the equations arising from @xmath79 .",
    "this ( as expressed by the @xmath80-independence of @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) means the static green s function obtained for @xmath83 in @xcite and the maximally quartic case we shall consider in section  [ sss : maximalquartic ] are also solutions in the presence of an arbitrary non - zero @xmath80 .",
    "the quintic interactions become relevant , however , for the full time - dependent green s function .",
    "we begin by asking : what is the contribution to the precession of perihelia of planetary orbits due to the galileon field of the sun ?",
    "this has been calculated in @xcite for galileons with only the cubic interaction term ; here we extend the calculation to the case of the full galileon theory with cubic , quartic , and quintic interactions . to zeroth order , the galileon field in the solar system is primarily governed by the field due to the sun , .",
    "as the orbits of the planets are well within the sun s vainshtein radius , the most nonlinear term dominates and hence the background solution is ( up to an additive constant ) well approximated by @xmath84 thus , we wish to consider the perihelion precession induced by a potential @xmath85 following the standard procedure for such calculations as found in any gr textbook , we find that to second order in the eccentricity @xmath86 for a planet with semi - major axis @xmath87 , the perihelion precession induced by the galileons relative to that induced by gr is @xmath88 with @xmath89 the schwarzschild radius of the sun .",
    "the galileon - induced precession thus decreases the precession per orbit from gr by an amount suppressed by the distance ratio @xmath90 . for the sun - mercury system",
    ", this is an effect at @xmath91 , and hence is unobservable by all current and near - future methods of measurement .",
    "note that this is the correct result only if the quartic interaction term dominates the cubic one at the orbit of the planet in question , or in other words , when @xmath92 ( see below ) .",
    "if we wish to consider the crossover from this behavior to the cubic - dominated precession which is several orders of magnitude larger , we must consider the full galileon force law .",
    "this precession calculation treats every object in the solar system , other than the sun itself , as a test body with negligible mass .",
    "however , due to the highly nonlinear nature of the galileon field in the solar system , it is important to go beyond this one body problem .",
    "we proceed henceforth to investigate the dynamics of objects due to galileon interactions between such objects within the background field of a large central mass .      to lowest order in galileon self - interactions , the scalar force between two test masses in the presence of the sun can be determined from the curved - space green s function with the effective metric as obtained from ( [ kineticterms ] ) and ( [ eq : g_eff_general ] ) .",
    "we seek a full green s function solution as an expansion in spherical harmonics via the ansatz @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are , respectively , the larger and smaller of @xmath7 and @xmath96 .",
    "henceforth , @xmath97 should be understood to mean the piecewise - defined function that is @xmath98 when @xmath99 and @xmath100 when @xmath101 .",

    "first note that the stability requirement that all the @xmath104s be positive restricts the viable parameter space to @xmath107 as discussed in @xcite ( this analysis is modified for a spacetime which is not asymptotically minkowski - see @xcite ) .",
    "we will focus on the case where @xmath108 , since the quintic term has little effect on the analysis - it does not affect the background solution and only appears in @xmath109 and hence is irrelevant for the static green s function .    note also that there are three different distance regimes relevant to the problem .",
    "the first is the regime far from the sun ( i.e , the central mass ) beyond which the nonlinearities are unimportant , the second is the intermediate - distance regime where the cubic term dominates the dynamics , and the final one is the near - source regime where the quartic term dominates over the cubic term in determining the dynamics .",
    "the linear - nonlinear transition happens at a scale @xmath110 and the cubic - quartic transition at a second scale @xmath111 , as defined by : @xmath112 where it is convenient to define a new parameter @xmath113 controlling the relative importances of the cubic and quartic terms , via @xmath114 the bounds on the magnitude of @xmath113 are a consequence of the stability conditions above .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : speed ] we demonstrate the effects on the radial and angular sound speeds for these same values .",
    "as is well - known for the galileons , radial waves propagate superluminally ; note that larger quartic interaction strength correlates with faster maximum propagation speed .",
    "it is unclear whether such superluminality presents a problem for the viability of the theory ; @xcite argues that it is an indicator that the theory can not be uv completed and is macroscopically non - local , whereas @xcite argue that causality is preserved despite superluminal signal propagation and hence the theory is no less safe than gr under the hawking chronology protection principle .",
    "additionally , @xcite shows that for a specific choice of parameters , the galileon theory ( with accompanying vainshtein mechanism and superluminal signals ) is dual to a free field theory , and thus has an analytic s - matrix and is causal .",
    "it is also apparent from fig .",

    "see , for instance , @xcite  signals in curved space do not propagate solely on the light cone ; there is also a tail of signals propagating everywhere within the light cone .",
    "secondly , it makes superluminal propagation of fluctuations inside the vainshtein radius manifest .    for the case at hand , using the solution  ( [ eq : background ] ) , the relevant functions are easily read off , and in the limits @xmath126 ( outside vainshtein ) and @xmath127 ( inside vainshtein ) , they are given by the approximate expressions @xmath128 hence , the effective metric approaches the flat one far outside the vainshtein radius , whereas deep inside the vainshtein radius @xmath129 it is now immediately apparent that well outside the vainshtein radius , fluctuations propagate precisely luminally , as in flat space .",
    "well inside the vainshtein radius , the behavior of null geodesics tells us that @xmath130 and in particular , the radial fluctuations propagate superluminally ( @xmath131 ) and the angular fluctuations propagate subluminally ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "although at zeroth order the propagator well outside the vainshtein radius is simply the flat - space propagator , it is less straightforward to calculate the propagator well inside the vainshtein radius , for which we must solve for the green s function of the differential operator @xmath133 , obeying ( see ) @xmath134 for simplicity we will focus on the static propagator .",
    "as already alluded to , this treatment assumes that the static force law is a good description of the dynamics despite the existence of galileon wave tails propagating inside , not on , the light - cone . strictly speaking this assumption needs to be checked via an actual calculation .",
    "however , we argue , on physical grounds , that this is a valid assumption as long as the speed of propagation of galileons is much larger than the velocity of the astrophysical objects whose dynamics we wish to study .",

    "the expansion does not depend at all on the existence of the large central mass , but now it becomes clear that the relevant distance scale is the vainshtein radius of the small masses whose dynamics we are considering .",

    "let us now reconsider the expansion , taking this into consideration .",
    "we will keep track of two separate distance scales : @xmath7 , the distance of a dynamical object from the large central mass , and @xmath305 , the separation between two arbitrary dynamical objects .",
    "well within the vainshtein radius , the propagator in now scales as @xmath306 where the first term originates from the solution sourced by the @xmath307 function and the second term from the homogeneous solutions .",

    "these considerations correct the zeroth- and first - order ( in either small parameter ) diagrams as in fig .",

    "enter at the same order and hence any truncation of the expansion at finite order yields an error in the force of order the result calculated .",
