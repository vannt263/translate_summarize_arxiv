    "the origin of the flavor structure is a big puzzle in particle physics . in the standard model ,",
    "the masses and mixing of quarks and leptons are just parameters given by hand .",
    "obviously this is unsatisfactory , and there have been many attempts to explain the fermion mass matrices in the literature @xcite .",
    "there are some characteristic features in the quark and lepton mass matrices . as for the mixing among different generations , the quark sector has all small mixing angles whereas the neutrino sector has two large mixings and one small one . another important property concerns the mass hierarchy of the quarks and leptons .",
    "the third generation of the quarks and charged leptons are heavier than the other generations .",
    "in particular , the top quark is much heavier than the others .",
    "here we shall point out that the large top quark mass can be accounted for by a singular normalization of its kinetic term .",
    "after rescaling the fields to get the canonical normalization , one can obtain a large yukawa coupling and thus a large mass of the top quark .",
    "we shall demonstrate this interesting possibility in the framework of a democratic fermion mass matrix model @xcite . in the democratic @xmath0 symmetry ,",
    "the fermions belong to 3 dimensional reducible representations , which are decomposed into 1 and 2 dimensional representations .",
    "the trivial representation is identified with the field in the third generation .",
    "this group theoretical structure allows the third generation to have different normalization from the other two generations@xcite . we will show that , with diagonal breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry , the singular normalization of the top quark is essential to reproduce observed quark masses and mixing angles .",
    "we will also discuss other examples where this mechanism may be important .",
    "the model we are considering was described in refs .",
    "non - canonical khler potential was introduced in ref .",
    "we would like to briefly review essential points of our model . here",
    "we focus on the quark sector .",

    ", there are a product of permutation symmetry groups @xmath1 . under @xmath2 , the doublet quarks @xmath3 ( @xmath4 2 , 3 ) transform as 3 dimensional representation , @xmath5 , which is decomposed into two irreducible representations : @xmath6 .",
    "here @xmath7 is a trivial representation and @xmath8 is two dimensional one .",
    "in fact , @xmath9 does not change under the permutation .",
    "the other two combinations will constitute a basis of @xmath8 .",

    "we consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to illustrate our points , and use the terminology of supersymmetry , such as khler potential and superpotential .",
    "supersymmetry is , however , not essential for our subsequent argument .    to begin with",
    "we will develop some formalism .",
    "let us introduce a @xmath5 representation , @xmath13 , which will be identified with three families of the mssm matter fields later .",

    "we assume that some dynamics fixes vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , @xmath20 existence of the democratic part @xmath21 plays an essential role in our arguments .",
    "in fact , the non - universal kinetic terms stem from @xmath22 , @xmath23_{ij}.    \\label{eq : metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the following matrix : @xmath24 @xmath25 is diagonalized as @xmath26 where @xmath27 hereafter we will call the field basis obtained this way the diagonal basis .",
    "the kinetic terms are written explicitly @xmath28 in this basis , it becomes clear that the reducible @xmath5 representation consists of the trivial @xmath7 representation and the irreducible @xmath8 representation .",
    "after rescaling the fields by using the diagonal matrix @xmath29 we obtain canonically normalized kinetic terms : @xmath30 we will call this field basis the canonical basis .",
    "let us consider yukawa interaction which consists of two matter fields @xmath31 and a higgs field @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 represent a yukawa coupling matrix .",
    "the @xmath35 symmetry allows @xmath34 to have only the democratic matrix : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath38 in the diagonal basis and that @xmath39 in the canonical basis , and thus no mixing angle arises .",
    "notice that only the @xmath40 element in @xmath41 and @xmath42 survives since both of the @xmath7 representation of @xmath43 and the one of @xmath44 must be involved in order for couplings to be invariant .",
    "therefore , there appear two massless fields and one massive field after the higgs develops a vev , which , roughly speaking , simulates our world .",
    "@xmath0 breaking parameters must be involved in order to make our model realistic .",

    "one is convinced that @xmath42 is almost diagonal and that resulting mixing angles will be small .",
    "after diagonalization of @xmath42 , @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50 where @xmath51 here we choose @xmath52 and @xmath53 to be real and ignore higher orders of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 notice that in the case where @xmath58 , a hierarchical spectrum is derived : @xmath59 hereafter we assume this type of hierarchy since it matches with the observed quark mass hierarchy as we will see shortly .",
    "let us apply the above discussion to the quark sector in the mssm , in which the left - handed quark doublets @xmath60 , the charge - conjugated right - handed up - type quarks @xmath61 and the charge - conjugated right - handed down - type quarks @xmath62 exist .",
    "the up - type yukawa coupling matrix and the down - type one are diagonalized as @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 one finds that the small @xmath0 breaking parameters induce small mixing angles . notice that our model naturally includes the model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where non - universal kinetic terms are absent .",
    "we can express the ckm matrix elements in terms of the mass eigenvalues .",
    "the cabibbo angle is determined solely by the observed values as @xmath66 this fritzsch relation have been known to be successful @xcite .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 notice that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ckm ] ) values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are almost fixed by the empirical masses as @xmath73 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : masses ] ) and ( [ eq : ulr ] ) ) .",
    "thus , parameters determined from @xmath67 and @xmath74 are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 does not play an essential role .",
    "let us perform crude estimation before making numerical analysis , elucidating the importance of unusual structure of kinetic terms . for the present , we adopt the following representative values : @xmath78 taking into account that @xmath79 the area where @xmath80 itself is close to @xmath81 is preferable . from the constraint @xmath82",
    "one finds that the most favorable range is @xmath83 and @xmath84 we discard the case where @xmath85 since rather large @xmath80 is demanded . combining this inequality ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) ) with the constraint @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , we conclude that considerably suppressed @xmath76 is necessary in order that our @xmath0 model with the diagonal breaking matrices explains the empirical masses and mixings . recalling that @xmath90 this conclusion highlights a possibility that extremely large top mass is attributed to singular structure of normalization of the fields in the case of small @xmath91 .",
    "put another way , we draw a plot of the allowed value of the top quark mass @xmath92 as a function of @xmath76 when the other quantities are fit with their experimental values as above .",
    "the allowed region is depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : mt ] .",
    "one finds that the allowed top mass is rather sensitive to the choice of @xmath76 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the case of universal kinetic terms examined in ref .",
    "@xcite is completely ruled out and thus the inclusion of the singular normalization with extremely small @xmath76 is essential to make the model realistic .",
    "we now exhibit numerical analysis based on the diagonal breaking matrices . for simplicity we set @xmath93 , which does not alter our conclusion .",
    "the following parameter set , @xmath94 reproduces mass eigenvalues @xmath95 and magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements @xmath96 which should be compared with the experimental data evaluated at the @xmath97-boson mass scale @xcite .",
    "we have made the comparison at the @xmath97-boson mass scale .",
    "the same conclusion that extremely small @xmath76 is required holds even if we made this comparison at the gut scale in the mssm , though the value @xmath76 itself is different .",
    "this is because the effect of running comes from the top yukawa coupling , which appears in the wave - function renormalization of the top quark in supersymmetry .",
    "although we have so far supposed that the parameters which are responsible for quark masses and mixing angles are real , the observed @xmath98 asymmetry can be also explained in this framework by taking complex @xmath53 and @xmath52 .",
    "in this paper , we have pointed out the possibility that the wave function normalization of the top quark can be singular , which makes it very heavy .",
    "we have illustrated this in the framework of the democratic fermion ansatz . there",
    "the fermion mass structure is controlled by the @xmath0 permutation symmetries , with diagonal breaking introduced . in this case",
    ", we can make even a stronger statement : the singular normalization is essential to reproduce the top quark mass and the other quark masses as well as their mixing .",
    "this investigation presented here is indeed based on a particular form of the @xmath0 breaking . however , we emphasize that the large top quark mass can be realized by invoking singular structure of the corresponding kinetic terms .",
    "this argument is irrespective of the form of the @xmath0 breaking matrices .",
    "this new idea of highly different normalization of fields can save theories in which yukawa couplings would otherwise be suppressed and thus would fail to reproduce the large top mass .",
    "examples include    * brane - world scenarios in which quark and/or higgs fields propagate in the bulk . in this case",
    "yukawa coupling constants in four dimensions are volume - suppressed by some powers of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the compactification scale and @xmath101 the fundamental one ; * @xmath102 guts .",
    "an attractive feature of the @xmath102 guts is that the mssm higgs doublets can arise as pseudo - goldstone multiplets @xcite .",
    "a natural extension to @xmath102 from @xmath103 suggests to introduce @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 as quarks and leptons , and @xmath107 and @xmath105 as higgs multiplets .",
    "however with these matter contents one can not write down @xmath102 invariant yukawa couplings for up - quark masses at the renormalizable level .",
    "up - type yukawa couplings arise from non - renormalizable operators and are suppressed by powers of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 represents the gut scale .",
    "thus one conventionally introduce * 20 * to obtain the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "our mechanism of the yukawa enhancement due to the singular wave - function normalization , however , may allow us to construct a simpler model without introducing the * 20 * multiplet .    throughout this paper",
    ", we have assumed that the singular normalization for the top quark is realized by some means , but we have not specified a possible mechanism .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility is that the singular normalization is realized dynamically associated with , for example , the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "although a naive inspection suggests that one needs a very flat potential for a field responsible for the wave - function normalization , which is thus unlikely , further study along this line is interesting and should be encouraged .",
