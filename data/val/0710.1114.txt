    "in 2001 , two new supernova remnants ( snrs ) with low radio surface brightness , g85.4 + 0.7 and g85.9@xmath00.6 , were discovered in canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps)@xcite data and confirmed in x - rays with  data @xcite . both show distinct shells in the radio band with an extended region of x - ray emission in the centre .",
    "the radio surface brightness of g85.4 + 0.7 at 1 ghz is @xmath16 watt @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and the radio data also indicate that the snr has a non - thermal shell with angular diameter @xmath20 which is surrounded by a thermal shell with an angular diameter of @xmath21 and is located within an h i bubble .",
    "the bubble also contains two b stars which may have been part of the same association as the snr s progenitor star .",
    "g85.9@xmath00.6 has a radio surface brightness @xmath22 watt @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and it has no discernible h i features , indicating that it is expanding into a low density medium , perhaps between the local and perseus spiral arms .",
    "the most likely event which would produce an snr in such a region would be a type ia supernova .",
    "x - ray observations are important to the study of snrs , particularly those with low surface brightness , because they provide information about the morphology and emission processes of these objects , which are indicators of both the nature of the supernova explosion which formed them and the properties of the progenitor star .",
    "snrs with low surface brightness are expected to be formed after the core collapse of a massive star in a type ib / c or type ii explosion , because the stellar wind would have blown away much of the interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounding it , leaving a low ambient density into which the shock from the supernova expands .",
    "a type ia supernova can also result in a low surface brightness snr if the surrounding ism has a low density , such as it would if it were located between two spiral arms of the galaxy .",
    "thermal x - ray emission from a snr arises as the blast wave of the explosion travels through and shocks the ism , and as a reverse shock travels back into and shocks the ejecta .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the snr gives information about the temperature , the density , and the luminosity of the shocked material , while imaging data provides information about the size and morphology of the region .",
    "the low angular and spectral resolutions as well as the small number of counts in the  data did not allow spectroscopy nor detailed imaging to be done , so observations , described in ",
    "[ obs ] , have been made in order to confirm the detection of the snrs , and to perform imaging , spectroscopic and timing studies .",
    "detailed x - ray imaging , described in  [ imaging ] , is used to map the diffuse emission and compare it to the location and size of the radio shells , and  data have been used to search for compact objects not resolved by xmm .",
    "spectral parameters obtained in  [ spec ] lead to an estimate of such quantities as temperature , density , and luminosity of the snrs . in  [ ps ] the point sources are catalogued and an attempt at identification is made by matching their positions to objects in other catalogues .",
    "timing analysis is performed to identify any pulsar candidates .",
    "the distances to the snrs are derived from and co data in  [ dist ] .",
    "the results are discussed in ",
    "[ disc ] .",
    "preliminary results were presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "snr g85.4 + 0.7 was observed with  on 2005 may 31 for 11.5 ks ( obs i d : 0307130101 , pi : s. safi - harb ) and again on october 27 for 15.2 ks ( obs i d 0307130301 , pi : s. safi - harb ) , because of proton flares in the first observation which made a large fraction of the data unusable .",
    "a 29 ks  observation was made of snr g85.9@xmath00.6 on 2005 november 24 ( obs i d 0307130201 , pi : s. safi - harb ) .",
    "the pn @xcite and mos @xcite data were reduced with the latest version of sas ( 6.5.0 ) and events during proton flares were filtered out for producing images and spectra by using the sas routines _",
    "evselect _ to create rate files and _ tabgtigen _ to generate good time intervals ( gtis ) for filtering the event files with the _ evselect _ routine .",
    "this rendered the first observation of g85.4 + 0.7 useful only for imaging , and slightly reduced the integration time , from 29 ks to 26 ks for the g85.9@xmath00.6 observation .",
    "the second observation of g85.4 + 0.7 shows no evidence for proton flaring and the removal of proton flares did not significantly reduce the integration time .",
    "images and spectra were created from the event files using _ evselect_. the total effective exposure time for g85.4 + 0.7 was 14  ks for pn and 16  ks for the mos instruments and for g85.9@xmath00.6 it was 23  ks for pn and 26  ks for mos .",
    "to facilitate source detection , exposure maps were made using _",
    "eexpmap _ and the images were combined using _",
    "emosaic_. the spectra were binned using a minimum of 25 - 50 counts per bin for the mos instruments and 50 or 100 counts per bin for the pn for the point source and diffuse spectra respectively , using _ grppha_. this latter grouping was necessary because the background subtraction added excessive noise to the spectra , particularly at high energies , where the spectra are background - dominated .",
    "the background for both snrs was calculated using various methods described in  [ bg ] .",
    "a 14.5 ks observation of snr g85.4 + 0.7 was made on 2003 january 26 ( obs i d : 3898 , pi : s. safi - harb ) by the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ; g. garmire ) .",
    "snr g85.9@xmath00.6 was observed with acis - s for 20.2 ks on 2003 october 3 ( obs i d : 3899 , pi : s. safi - harb ) .",
    "both observations were made at a focal plane temperature of @xmath23c .",
    "the analysis of the  data was done using chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao version 3.3 ) . for both observations ,",
    "the data were corrected for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) with tools provided by the acis team of pennsylvania @xcite .",
    "events with  grades ( 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) were retained , and periods of high background rates were removed .",
    "data from hot pixels were eliminated .",
    "the effective exposure time for the observation of snr g85.4 + 0.7 was 14.3 ks and for snr g85.9@xmath00.6 it was 19.9 ks .",
    "the backgrounds for the point source spectra were extracted from annuli surrounding the sources .",
    "the spectra were grouped with a mimimum of 30 counts in each bin .",
    "data from the s2 and s3 chips were used .",
    "data from the other chips were not used because they do not overlap the xmm field of view .",
    "the previous x - ray images from the  all - sky survey did not resolve the snrs and the point sources in the field , so the  pn and mos data can be used to determine the nature of the sources .",
    "the results are described below .",
    "the 0.52.5 kev  pn and mos mosaic image of g85.4 + 0.7 with radio contours overlaid is shown in figure  [ 85.4image ] .",
    "the image includes only energies between 0.5 and 2.5 kev in order to match the rosat bandpass and because there is negligible diffuse emission above 2.5 kev .",
    "the x - ray image is smoothed with a gaussian filter with a 3 pixel radius .",
    "the x - ray emission is in the same location and is a similar angular size as indicated by the  data , shown in figure 6 of @xcite , with an approximate angular radius of 6.7@xmath24 .",
    "it is much better resolved , however , and the regions of diffuse emission and the point sources are clearly visible .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ 85.4reg ] show the 0.52.5  kev and 2.510  kev  images of g85.4 - 0.7 , smoothed in the same way as figure  [ 85.4image ] .",
    "the absence of diffuse emission in the hard x - ray band is clear from the middle panel .",
    "the lower panel shows the 0.52.5  kev image with sources subtracted , smoothed further and scaled to emphasize the diffuse emission , and smoothed contours are overlaid to show the morphology of the remnant .",
    "the contours indicate a centrally filled morphology with a slightly elongated shape .",
    "the circles in the top panel indicate spectral extraction regions described in  [ spec85.4 ] and  [ disc85.4 ] .",
    "there are nine point sources in the image from which spectra can be extracted , and the analysis is described in  [ ps ] .",
    "the extraction regions for the spectra , including the background for the diffuse emission , are indicated and labeled in figure  [ 85.4reg ] , and the spectral analysis of the diffuse emission is described in  [ spec85.4 ] .",
    "the  image of snr g85.4 + 0.7 is shown in figure  [ cha85.4 ] .",
    "the extraction regions used for the source and background regions are shown , and the applicable regions from the  observation are overlaid .",
    "the _ wavdetect _ tool in ciao is used for source detection .",
    "six of the point sources identified with  ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 7 ) are clearly visible on the  image .",
    "twelve additional sources appear on the  image ( labeled 10@xmath021 ) but the spectra extracted from these point sources do not contain enough counts to enable meaningful spectral analysis , so while they are potential neutron star candidates and sources 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , and 16 are situated well within the radio shell of the snr , further investigation of these sources is not possible at this time .      the  pn and mos mosaic image of g85.9@xmath00.6 with radio contours overlaid is shown in figure  [ 85.9image ] .",
    "the image is smoothed in the same way as the g85.4 + 0.7 image , with a gaussian filter with a three - pixel radius . as with g85.4",
    "+ 0.7 , the angular radius of approximately 5.8@xmath24 and location of the x - ray emission shown in this figure matches that of figure 6 of @xcite and many features are resolved .",
    "0.52.5 kev and 2.510.0 kev x - ray images are shown in the top two panels of figure  [ 85.9reg ] .",
    "it is clear from the hard x - ray image that the snr does not appear above 2.5 kev , and the x - ray spectrum is background dominated above 2.5 kev , as will be explored in  [ spec85.9 ] .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ 85.9reg ] shows the same data as in the top panel with point source emission subtracted , scaled to emphasize the diffuse emission .",
    "the contours in the bottom panel are smoothed to show the overall morphology of the remnant .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emitting region seems to be round in shape , indicating a centrally filled x - ray morphology .",
    "the circles in the top panel indicate spectral extraction regions described in  [ spec85.9 ] and  [ disc85.9 ] .",
    "spectra were extracted from 8 point sources and the diffuse region , as indicated in the top panel of figure [ 85.9reg ] .",
    "the analysis of the spectrum from the diffuse region is described in ",
    "[ spec85.9 ] , and ",
    "[ ps ] describes the analysis of the point sources .",
    "figure  [ cha85.9 ] shows the  image of snr g85.9@xmath00.6 .",
    "the locations of the extraction circles for sources 1 and 8 in the  image are shown , in addition to the additional point sources found on the  image ( labeled 9@xmath027 ) .",
    "the   image does not show any point sources which have sufficient counts to do independent spectroscopic analysis , and only one of the sources identified from the  image ( source 8) lies within the field of view of the  image , with which a  source has been identified .",
    "the spectra from the regions of diffuse emission were extracted from areas indicated in figures  [ 85.4reg ] and [ 85.9reg ] for both pn and mos .",
    "the diffuse emission regions and point sources are indicated and labeled in the figures .",
    "the spectra of the diffuse emission for both snrs were fit to various models : a simple bresstrahlung model with gaussian lines , vmekal , vnei , and vpshock , each modified by interstellar absorption , in this case the wisconsin absorption model ( wabs in xspec , @xcite ) .",
    "vmekal is a collisional ionization equilibrium model based on the model calculations of @xcite of the emission spectrum from hot diffuse gas with fe calculations by @xcite , with variable abundances .",
    "vpshock is a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model with variable abundances which models a plane parallel shock in a plasma with constant electron temperature t and a range of ionization timescales with an upper limit @xmath25 , where @xmath6 is the postshock electron density and @xmath26 is the shock age @xcite .",
    "vnei is a nei model similar to vpshock , except with a single ionization timescale .",
    "spectra of diffuse faint regions require particular attention to be paid to the choice of background region .",
    "instrumental emission lines can dominate the spectrum if the background region is poorly chosen , leading to errors in spectral fits and a discrepancy between the pn and mos spectra .",
    "the intuitive background region would be a relatively source free one at approximately the same galactic latitude as the source to minimize contamination by the galactic ridge .",
    "however , because the effect of instrumental emission lines is not uniform with position on the ccds , particularly on the pn instrument @xcite , and exceeds the variation with galactic latitude for these observations , the background regions were chosen as closely as possible to the point opposite the source region through the centre of the image , taking care that there is no overlap between the source and background regions and omitting regions around point sources .",
    "the background regions for both snrs are necessarily smaller than the source regions , but very little change in the spectral fits resulted from choosing various background regions in the same general area of the image .",
    "an attempt has been made to estimate the mos background spectra using the  extended source analysis software ( xmm - esas ) @xcite .",
    "as yet , background estimation for the pn instrument is not included in this package .",
    "data from filter wheel closed observations and from the unexposed corners of the mos ccds are used to generate background spectra .",
    "this serves as a test of the backgrounds generated from the observation itself , described above . to fit spectra using the xmm - esas backgrounds , it is necessary to include some additional spectral components , as recommended in @xcite .",
    "unabsorbed gaussian lines of zero width at energies of 1.49 and 1.75 kev are fit to the mos spectra in addition to the model describing the emission from the snr .",
    "the 1.75 kev line was also added to the fit to the mos spectra using the observation background .",
    "it was not necessary to add the 1.49 kev line to the fit of the g85.4 + 0.7 mos spectra using observation backgrounds because it was adequately subtracted , but the 1.49 kev line was added to the g85.9@xmath00.6 mos spectra using observation backgrounds .",
    "it was also necessary to include a low energy broken power law component to the g85.9@xmath00.6 fit of the esas - subtracted spectrum , as instructed in the esas documentation , to correct for instrumental effects , because the statistics allowed residuals at low energies to be clearly seen in the esas background subtracted spectra .",
    "the broken power law was not added to the spectrum of g85.4 + 0.7 because the spectra were noisy and did not require an additional model component .",
    "results of spectral fits using both background estimation methods for each snr are given in table  [ dfit ] .",
    "the parameters in the left hand column of table  [ dfit ] for each of the snrs are from the simultaneous fit to the mos spectra using the esas background subtraction method and the pn spectrum with the background spectrum extracted from the observation itself , and the right hand column contains the parameters from the simultaneous fit to the mos and pn spectra from both of which has been subtracted the observation background .    as a third background subtraction method ,",
    "we have attempted to use blank sky event files that are available for the pn and mos instruments and generated to enable the production of background spectra for extended sources .",
    "these event files comprise a superposition of pointed observations from which sources have been removed .",
    "background files produced from blank sky event files therefore simulate the detector response in an actual observation , including any instrumental emission lines .",
    "events are first selected from the original event files based on sky position using the _ selectradec _ script .",
    "the _ skycast _",
    "script @xcite is then used to cast the new event file onto the sky coordinates for the particular observation .",
    "the background spectra can be extracted from these files from the same region as for the source spectra .",
    "the backscal keyword is adjusted in the background file to scale it to the source file .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting background subtracted spectra are oversubtracted for the pn instrument , and contain negative counts below 0.6 kev and above 1.5 kev .",
    "thus the blank sky background spectra can not be used for this analysis .",
    "possibly the oversubtraction results from the fact that there are no observations within @xmath27 of the snrs g85.4 + 0.7 or g85.9@xmath00.6 contained in the blank sky datasets , and therefore systematic errors arise from the different level of background emission .",
    "the background subtracted pn spectra of g85.4 + 0.6 using a background from the observation itself and from the blank sky file is shown in figure  [ pnback ] .",
    "the spectra from which the blank sky background was subtracted were not used and thus the parameters do not appear in table  [ dfit ] .",
    "the pn and mos spectra between 0.5 and 2.5 kev are simultaneously fit in order to determine the best parameters while reducing instrument - specific and systematic effects .",
    "the upper limit of 2.5 kev is used for the spectral fits because the spectra are background dominated above this energy as shown in figure  [ pnback ] .",
    "fitting to the vmekal model results in a reduced @xmath28 value of 1.76 for the esas background or 1.63 for the observation background ( this refers to the mos spectra only ; the background spectra extracted from the observation was used for every pn spectrum ) , and a @xmath29 value of @xmath30 or @xmath31 kev ( all errors are @xmath32 ) for the esas and observation background respectively .",
    "the spectra are best fit with an absorbed vpshock with with @xmath29 of 1.1 @xmath33 kev for the esas background or @xmath34 kev for the backgrounds extracted from the observation itself , and ionization timescale of @xmath35 @xmath8 s for the esas background or @xmath36 @xmath8 s for the background extracted from the observation .",
    "the spectrum for the diffuse region is shown with the esas background in figure  [ 85.4esasspec ] and with the observation background in figure  [ 85.4spec ] .",
    "the parameters for the simultaneous pn and mos fits , with 2@xmath37 uncertainties , are given in table  [ dfit ] , along with derived quantities such as luminosity and age .",
    "the fitted parameters agree well within uncertainty for the two background estimation methods .",
    "the abundances are for the most part consistent with solar , with exceptions given in table  [ dfit ] .",
    "an analysis of the spectral fit parameters has shown g85.4 + 0.7 to have a 0.52.5 kev luminosity of @xmath38 erg s@xmath39 or @xmath40 erg s@xmath39 for the esas or observation backgrounds respectively , in both cases based on the estimated distance of @xmath1 kpc for g85.4 + 0.7 , determined in ",
    "the normalizations of the instrumental lines in the mos spectra from which the esas background has been subtracted are ( 1.7@xmath410.2)@xmath42 and ( 5.5@xmath43)@xmath42 photons @xmath44s@xmath39 for the lines at 1.49 and 1.75 kev respectively .",
    "the normalization for the line at 1.75 kev for the observation background is ( @xmath45)@xmath46 photons @xmath44s@xmath39 .    to verify the fits to elemental abundances ,",
    "the vnei model was used in place of vpshock .",
    "all elemental abundances were found to be consistent within error to be solar or subsolar , except o and fe .",
    "o was clearly enhanced above a solar value , giving strength to the vpshock result .",
    "the elemental abundances using the vmekal model were also qualitatively similar to the vpshock result .",
    "the approach used for fitting the diffuse spectra of g85.9@xmath00.6 is similar to that used for g85.4 + 0.7 .",
    "again , the upper limit of 2.5 kev is used for the spectral fits because the spectra are background dominated above this energy .",
    "the pn diffuse spectrum was fitted simultaneously with the mos spectra from which either the esas or observation background was subtracted .",
    "fitting to the vmekal model results in a reduced @xmath28 of 2.21 for the esas background and 2.48 for the observation background , a @xmath29 value of @xmath47 or @xmath48 kev .",
    "the spectra of the diffuse emission from the remnants are best fit with an absorbed vpshock model with @xmath29 of @xmath49 kev for the esas background or @xmath50 kev for the background extracted from the observation and ionization timescale @xmath51 @xmath8 s for the esas background or @xmath52 @xmath8 s for the background extracted from the observation .",
    "the fitted parameters with 2@xmath37 uncertainties are given in table  [ dfit ] and the diffuse spectrum with the esas background is shown in figure  [ 85.9esasspec ] and with the observation background in figure  [ 85.9spec ] .",
    "the abundances are for the most part consistent with solar , and the exceptions are shown in table  [ dfit ] .",
    "the luminosity of g85.9@xmath00.6 is @xmath53 erg s@xmath39 for the esas background or @xmath54 erg s@xmath39 for the observation background , in both cases based on the estimated distance of @xmath55 kpc for g85.9@xmath00.6 , determined in ",
    "the normalizations for the 1.49 and 1.75 kev lines in the esas subtracted mos spectra are ( 1.22@xmath56)@xmath57 and ( 3.7@xmath58)@xmath42 photons @xmath44s@xmath39 respectively .",
    "the broken power law which was added to the fit of the mos esas - background subtracted spectrum had @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 kev , and a normalization of @xmath62 photons@xmath63kev@xmath64@xmath65 s at 1 kev .",
    "the normalization of the 1.75 kev line for the observation background is ( @xmath66)@xmath46 photons @xmath44s@xmath39 .",
    "when the vnei model was used in place of vpshock to check the elemental abundances , as was done with g85.4 + 0.7 , all elemental abundances were found to be consistent within error to be solar or subsolar , except o and fe , both of which are clearly above solar abundance when the error bar is taken into account , in agreement with the vpshock result . using the vmekal model , the elemental abundances are again qualitatively similar to those obtained from the vpshock model , except mg is above solar .",
    "the previous  data of the snr regions produced contours of the diffuse emission but did not resolve any point sources .",
    "the presently considered  and  data allow for point sources to be resolved and located within the field of view .",
    "nine clearly distinguishable point sources are seen on the image of g85.4 + 0.7 ( figure  [ 85.4reg ] ) , of which six ( sources 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 7 ) are in common with point sources in the  observation , as shown in figure  [ cha85.4 ] .",
    "twelve additional point sources are clearly resolved in the  observation ( labeled as sources 10 through 21 in figure  [ cha85.4 ] ) , but they do not possess sufficient counts to allow for meaningful spectral analysis to be done .",
    "it should be noted that the b stars in @xcite are outside of the field of view of the x - ray observations .",
    "eight point sources are seen on the  image of g85.9@xmath00.6 ( figure  [ 85.9reg ] ) of which only one source ( source 8) is visible on the  image , which is pointed toward the region encompassing sources 1 and 8 in figure  [ 85.9reg ] .",

    "the output of the routine gives position on the image and in sky coordinates , source counts , source extent , as well as errors in those quantities . because the pn and mos instruments have slightly different fields of view , only those sources found in the combined image which are also found on the pn image are analysed .",
    "the sources must also have an extent ( size on the image ) similar to the psf at that location on the image , and they must contain enough counts ( @xmath67 ) for the spectral and timing analysis .",
    "a catalogue of newly discovered x - ray point sources is given in tables  [ pscat85.4 ] and [ pscat85.9 ] .",
    "the letters xmmu in the object designations indicate that they were discovered in  data and a prefix of cxo indicates a discovery in  data .",
    "the  all sky survey catalogue was checked to see if any of the sources appear there , and source 1 in the g85.9@xmath00.6 image ( figure  [ 85.9reg ] ) is well within the 24@xmath68 @xmath69 error circle of the coordinates of the  all sky survey object 1rxs j205911.3 + 444730 , and source 1 in the g85.4 + 0.7 image ( figure  [ 85.4reg ] ) lies marginally within the 24@xmath68 @xmath69 error circle of the rass object 1rxs j205058.7 + 452135 .",
    "no other point sources in this study match any in the rass catalogue , indicating that these point sources are too faint to be included in the rass catalogue .",
    "the sky coordinates of sources meeting the above criteria are searched within the extent , which is approximately the psf size , in various catalogues , including the usno - a2.0 catalogue @xcite , the usno - b1.0 catalogue @xcite , the sky2000 catalogue @xcite , the catalogue given in @xcite , and the 2mass catalogue @xcite , to determine whether the sources have already been identified in another waveband .",
    "some of these catalogues give blue magnitude and if this is converted into flux with the relation @xmath70 and compared with the x - ray flux , this ratio is one factor that can be checked to favour identification as a neutron star . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are the blue magnitudes of the object and a standard star and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are their fluxes .",
    "typical neutron stars have a flux ratio in optical to x - ray bands of @xmath75 @xcite , whereas x - ray emitting o- or b - type stars such as @xmath76 carinae @xcite or @xmath77 scorpii @xcite have a ratio of @xmath78 , which enables an identification to be made of neutron star candidates .",
    "the optical to x - ray flux ratios for the point sources , matched with each of the catalogue objects within their extents are shown in tables  [ pscat85.4 ] and [ pscat85.9 ] .",
    "these values represent the optical to x - ray flux ratio should the catalogue object match the x - ray source .",
    "if the optical catalogue source and the x - ray point source are not the same object , the ratio is meaningless .",
    "however , an x - ray source without any optical counterparts within the psf , such as source 6 or 7 from the g85.9@xmath00.6 data , may be a good neutron star candidate .",
    "in other words , this test does not exclude x - ray point sources as neutron star candidates but rather indicates that a source emits in x - rays , and is much fainter in the optical waveband , and is unlikely to be a stellar object .",

    "these are larger than the age estimates from the radio data .",
    "the mass of the emitting gas is calculated based on spherical emitting regions with the size given by the extraction radius ( given in table  [ dfit ] ) , composed of 92% hydrogen and 8% helium , and the relation @xmath139 is used as for the above calculation of @xmath26 .",

    "the background subtraction was problematic , particularly for the spectrum of g85.4 + 0.7 , which is fainter and required a different model to be fit to it depending on which background region on the observation was used , leading to a very careful selection of the background extraction region , the process of which is described in  [ bg ] .",
    "instrumental lines , which are fortunately different for pn and mos , nevertheless increased the value of @xmath28 for the combined fits , even when the background was chosen very carefully , and needed to be explicitly fit when the esas background was used , as described in  [ bg ] .",
    "in addition , the soft spectra of the snrs exhibit large amounts of noise in the high energy end of the spectra , allowing fits to be made only up to 2.5 kev .",
    "future longer observations of these snrs will help to resolve these difficulties , allow for better fits to the abundances , eliminate ambiguities in the spectral results , and perhaps allow for conclusive identifications of neutron star and pulsar candidates in addition to other point sources .",
    "a comparison between the morphologies of the x - ray diffuse emission and the radio emission of g85.4 + 0.7 can be seen in figure  [ 85.4imagens ] in which the x - ray point sources have been removed and the x - ray image has been smoothed to 1@xmath24 to match the radio contours .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission exhibits some structure , and it lies in the approximate centre of the radio shell .",
    "a spectrum was extracted from the central blob , the position and size of which is shown in the top panel of figure  [ 85.4reg ] , and it could not be adequately fit with a non - thermal power law model , indicating that a pulsar wind nebula origin for the emission can be ruled out .",
    "the fact that the snr does not exhibit any limb brightening and the x - ray emission is mostly concentrated in the centre , as projected in the plane of the sky and three dimensionally , can be interpreted as evidence that the x - ray emission is produced by the ejecta .",
    "the fact that there appears to be no emission from the swept up material can be explained if the remnant is evolutionarily young .    with the ejecta interpretation ,",
    "if it is assumed that the free electrons are evenly distributed in the extraction area , the resulting ages are 18 and 23 kyr for the two backgrounds . in figure  [ 85.4imagens ] it can be seen that the outer radio shell has an approximately constant radius , whereas the inner shell has a smaller radius in the vertical centre , which expands as the latitude changes , and this indicates that the snr is moving either toward us or away from us .",
    "the two shells appear to meet near the bottom of the image , so the radius of the snr can be approximated as that of the outer shell , which is @xmath144 on the image .",
    "the average velocity of the expanding snr is then 910 or 730 km / s for the two ages .",
    "however , the morphology of the x - ray emission is not very smooth , indicating that the filling factor @xmath145 . assuming",
    "@xmath146 , the electron density @xmath6 would be 0.25 @xmath8 for either the esas and observation background , and the ejecta masses would be 1.3 @xmath147 for either background .",
    "the shock age would then be 8000 or 10300 years , and the average expansion velocity would be 2150 or 1640 km / s . for a @xmath148 erg supernova explosion , the ejecta mass would be 22 or 37 @xmath147 , or 2.2 or 3.7 @xmath147 for a @xmath149 erg explosion , indicating that the lower energy explosion would result in an ejecta mass consistent with a young freely expanding snr .",
    "the radio continuum emission indicates that there is some swept up material . assuming that the density inside the stellar wind bubble was @xmath150 @xmath8 before the explosion",
    ", the snr would have swept up @xmath151 @xmath147 of material , which is on the order of the ejecta mass , and means that the snr is in the transition between free expansion and sedov expansion .",
    "the slightly above - solar abundance of o in the diffuse spectra reinforces the hypothesis that the supernova most likely resulted from a core collapse , though the large error bars weaken the argument .",
    "the abundances of all elements other than o and fe are below solar , but they would be enhanced if the x - rays were from the ejecta .",
    "however , it is possible that the spectral parameters for the abundances are affected by the poor quality of the spectra and by the uncertainties associated with the background subtraction .",
    "since the most likely origin of g85.4 + 0.7 was a core collapse supernova ( see  [ dist ] ) , it is possible that a neutron star or pulsar which is associated with this snr can be found . given its power law x - ray spectrum , proximity to the centre of the remnant , and similar @xmath82 value to the diffuse emission , source 1 in figure [ 85.4reg ] is possibly the associated neutron star , but sources 4 and 9 are within the radio shell and are also candidates , given their spectral parameters .",
    "however , the low fit quality of source 4 ( @xmath152 ) indicates that it is not likely to be a neutron star , and source 9 is situated far from the centre of the diffuse emission so is less likely to be the associated neutron star .",
    "sources 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , or 16 in figure  [ cha85.4 ] can also be considered as neutron star candidates ( provided the optical counterparts listed in table  [ pscat85.4 ] are not the true counterparts .      figure  [ 85.9imagens ] shows x - ray and radio images of g85.9@xmath00.6 , produced in a similar way to figure  [ 85.4imagens ] .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission appears to contain less structure than g85.4 + 0.7 , and , as for g85.4 + 0.7 , a spectrum extracted from the central blob , the position and size of which are shown in the top panel of figure  [ 85.9reg ] , indicates that a pulsar wind nebula origin for the emission can be ruled out .    because figure  [ 85.4imagens ] shows no limb brightening and the emission is mostly from the central blob , a similar argument to that used for g85.4 + 0.7",
    "can be employed here to suggest an ejecta interpretation for the x - ray emission .",
    "assuming that the free electrons are evenly distributed in the extraction area the resulting age is 30 or 22 kyr for the two backgrounds . using the average distance between the centre of the x - ray emission and the shell , @xmath153 , the radius of the shell is 15.3 pc",
    "the average expansion velocity would then be 500 or 680 km / s .",
    "the emission is concentrated in the inner @xmath154 , which indicates an electron density of 0.20 @xmath8 and an ejecta mass of 1.0 @xmath147 which agrees with the predicted mass for a type ia explosion , 1.4 @xmath147 .",
    "this would result in an age of 10600 or 7800 years and average expansion velocity of 1350 or 1850 km / s .    for a type ia supernova ,",
    "the explosion energy is @xmath155 erg and the ejecta mass is 1.4 @xmath147 . unlike for g85.4 + 0.7",
    ", the density in the interarm region is closer to 0.1 @xmath8 , resulting in a swept up mass of nearly 50 @xmath147 .",
    "this indicates that the snr is in the sedov expansion phase , which is described by @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the radius in pc , @xmath158 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath148 erg , @xmath159 is the ambient density in @xmath8 , and @xmath26 is the age in units of @xmath160 years . for an explosion energy of 10@xmath161 erg , a radius of 15.3 pc , and an age of 10600 or 7800 years , the resulting ambient density is 0.84 or 0.55 @xmath8 which are consistent with the density of the interarm region , but the swept up mass would be 360 or 240 @xmath147 , from which it should be possible to measure thermal x - ray emission , from the part of the shell that is included in the x - ray pointing . the current expansion velocity would be @xmath162 , which is 570 or 760 km / s .",
    "the interpretation of g85.9@xmath00.6 as having been produced by a type ia supernova is reinforced by the fe abundance , which is well above solar . as with g85.4",
    "+ 0.7 , the ejecta interpretation is called into question by the remaining abundances , which should be above solar , but are instead below solar .",
    "this could again be a result of poor quality spectra .",
    "given that the radio results described in @xcite , as well as the distance presented here , indicated that g85.9@xmath00.6 was most likely produced by a type ia supernova , it was not expected to find a neutron star associated with this snr .",
    "the above solar fe abundance for this snr is consistent with a type ia explosion .",
    "an identification of sources 6 and 7 in figure  [ 85.9reg ] has not yet been made .",

    "their identification with possible 2mass counterparts ( see table  [ pscat85.9 ] ) makes them more likely radio - quiet agn than neutron stars , provided the 2mass objects are the true counterparts . a future detailed deep x - ray or multiwavelength study of these objects",

    "source 4 is on the edge of the radio shell of the snr , but its identification as a neutron star is questionable because of its photon index and hardness ratio , as well as the fact that it is not expected that there is a neutron star associated with this remnant .",
    "the centrally filled morphology of both snrs and the thermal nature of their x - ray emission confined within the radio shells suggest that they belong to the class of mixed - morphology snrs ( also known as thermal composites ; rho & petre 1997 ) .",
    "the origin of the thermal x - ray emission interior to the radio shells in these snrs has been attributed to several mechanisms which include : a ) cloudlet evaporation in the snr interior ( white & long 1991 ) , b ) thermal conduction smoothing out the temperature gradient across the snr and enhancing the central density ( cox et al .",
    "1999 ) , c ) a radiatively cooled rim with a hot interior ( e.g. harrus et al .",
    "1997 ) , and d ) possible interaction with a nearby cloud ( e.g. safi - harb et al .",
    "while modeling these snrs in the light of the above mentioned models is beyond the scope of this paper and has to await better quality data , we can rule out the cloudlet evaporation model based on the low ambient densities inferred from our spectral fits ( see  7.1 and table  1 ) .",
    "except for fe and possibly o ,",
    "the abundances inferred from our spectral fits are for the most elements consistent with or below solar values , as observed in most mixed - morphology snrs . however , enhanced metal abundances have been observed in younger snrs , e.g. 3c  397 , estimated to be @xmath1185.3 kyr  old and proposed to be evolving into the mixed - morphology phase ( safi - harb et al .",
