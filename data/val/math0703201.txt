    "[ [ section ] ]    the biham - middleton - levine ( bml ) traffic models was first introduced in @xcite published 1992 .",
    "the model involves two types of cars : `` red '' and `` blue '' .",
    "initially the cars are placed in random with a given density @xmath0 on the @xmath1 torus .",
    "the system dynamics are as follows : at each turn , first all the red cars try to move simultaneously a single step to the right in the torus .",
    "afterwards all blue cars try to move a single step upwards .",
    "a car succeeds in moving as long as the relevant space above / beside it ( according to whether it is blue / red ) is vacant .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the basic properties of this model are described in @xcite and some recent more subtle observations due to larger simulations are described in @xcite . the main and most interesting property of the system originally observed in simulations is a _ phase transition _ : for some critical density @xmath2 one observes , that while filling the torus randomly with cars in density @xmath3 the system self organizes such that after some time all cars flow freely with no car ever running into another car ( see figure [ cars1 ] ) , by slightly changing the density to some @xmath4 not only does system not reach a free flow , but it will eventually get stuck in a configuration in which no car can ever move ( see figure [ cars2 ] ) .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    very little of the above behaviour is rigorously proven for the bml model .",
    "the main rigorous result is that of angel , holroyd and martin @xcite , showing that for some fixed density @xmath5 , very close to 1 , the probability of the system getting stuck tends to 1 as @xmath6 . in @xcite",
    "one can find a study of the very low density regime ( when @xmath7 ) .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    first , we introduce a slight variant of the original bml model by allowing a car ( say , red ) to move not only if there is a vacant place right next to it but also if there is a red car next to it that moves .",
    "thus , for sequence of red cars placed in a row with a single vacant place to its right - all cars will move together ( as oppose to only the rightmost car in the sequence for the original bml model ) . not only does this new variant exhibits the same phenomena of self - organization and phase transition , they even seem to appear more quickly ( i.e. it takes less time for the system to reach a stable state ) . actually the demonstrated simulations ( figures [ cars1 ] , [ cars2 ] ) were performed using the variant model .",
    "note that the results of @xcite appear to apply equally well to the variant model .    :",
    "the initial configuration in the left organizes after 520 steps to the `` diagonal '' configuration on the right which flows freely ]    : the initial configuration on the left gets to the stuck configuration on the right after 400 steps , in which no car can ever move ]    [ [ section-4 ] ]    in the following , we will analyze a simplified version of the bml model : bml on a single junction .",
    "meaning , we place red cars in some density @xmath0 on a single row of the torus , and blue cars are placed in density @xmath0 on a single column",
    ". we will show that for all @xmath0 the system reaches _ _ optimal speed _",
    "_ , depending only on @xmath0 . for @xmath8 we will show the system reaches speed 1 , while for @xmath9 the speed can not be 1 , but the system will reach the same speed , regardless of the initial configuration .",
    "moreover , at @xmath10 the system s behaviour undergoes a phase transition : we will prove that while for @xmath8 the stable configuration will have linearly many sequences of cars , for @xmath11 we will have only @xmath12 different sequences after some time .",
    "we will also examine what happens at a small window around @xmath10 .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    note that in the variant bml model ( and unlike the original bml model ) car sequences are never split .",
    "therefore , the simplified version of the variant bml model can be viewed as some kind of 1-dimensional coalescent process .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    much of the proofs below rely on the fact that we model bml on a symmetric torus .",
    "indeed , the time - normalization of section [ normalization ] would take an entirely different form if the height and width were not equal .",
    "we suspect that the model would exhibit similar properties if the height and width had a large common denominator , e.g. if they had a fixed proportion .",
    "more importantly , we believe that for height and width with low common denominator ( e.g. relatively prime ) , we would see a clearly different behaviour . as a simple example , note that in the relatively prime case , a speed of precisely 1 can not be attained , no matter how low is @xmath0 , in contrast with corollary [ speed1cor ] .",
    "this dependence on the arithmetic properties of the dimensions is also apparent in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    we start with the exact definition of our simplified model . on a cross shape , containing a single horizontal segment and a single vertical segment , both of identical length @xmath13 , red cars are placed in exactly @xmath14 randomly ( and uniformly ) chosen locations along the row , and blue cars are similarly placed in @xmath14 locations along the column .",
    "@xmath0 will be called the density of the configuration . for simplicity and consistency with the general bml model",
    ", we refer to the cars placed on the horizontal segment as red and those on the vertical segment as blue . for simplicity",
    "we may assume that the _ junction _",
    ", i.e. the single location in the intersection of the segments , is left unoccupied .",
    "the segments are cyclic - e.g. a red car located at the rightmost position ( @xmath15 ) that moves one step to the right re - emerges at the leftmost position ( 0 ) .    [ [ section-8 ] ]    at each turn , all the red cars move one step to the right , except that the red car that is just left of the junction will not move if a blue car is in the junction ( i.e. blocking it ) , in which case also all the red cars immediately following it will stay still . afterwards , the blue cars move similarly , with the red and blue roles switched . as in the original bml , we look at the asymptotic speed of the system , i.e. the ( asymptotic ) average number of steps a car moves in one turn . it is easily seen that this speed is the same for all blue cars and all red cars , since the number of steps any two cars of the same color have taken can not differ by more than @xmath13 .",
    "it is somewhat surprising , perhaps , that these two speed must also be the same .",
    "for instance , there is no configuration for which a blue car completes 2 cycles for every 1 a red car completes .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    though less natural , it will be sometimes useful to consider the equivalent description , in which two rows of cars - red and blue - are placed one beneath the other , with a `` special place '' - the junction - where at most one car can be present at any time . in every step",
    "first the red line shifts one to the right ( except cars immediately to the left of the junction , if it contains a blue car ) and then the blue line does the same .",
    "furthermore , instead of having the cars move to the right , we can have the junction move to the left , and when a blue car is in the junction , the ( possibly empty ) sequence of red cars immediately to the left of the junction moves to the left , and vice verse .",
    "figure [ timeimg ] illustrates the correspondence between these models .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    from the discussion above we get the following equivalent system , which we will call the time - normalized junction :        1 .   fix @xmath16 and fix some initial configuration @xmath17 representing the red and blue cars respectively , i.e. @xmath18 iff there s a red car at the @xmath19-th place .",
    "we require that @xmath20 , and at place @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) there is at most one car in both rows",
    ". 2 .   in each turn : * if place @xmath21 contains a blue car , and place @xmath23 contains a red car ( if @xmath24 ) , push this car one step to the left . by pushing the car we mean also moving all red cars that immediately followed it one step to the left , i.e. set @xmath25 , @xmath26 for @xmath27 $ ] . *",
    "if place @xmath21 does not contain a blue car and place @xmath23 contains both a red and a blue car ( if @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , push the blue car at @xmath23 one step to the left ( set @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 $ ] ) . * set @xmath33    note that indeed the dynamics above guarantee that after a turn place @xmath34 - the new junction - contains at most one car . generally , as long as cars flow freely , the time - normalized system configuration does not change ( except for the location of the junction ) .",
    "cars in the time - normalized system configuration actually move only when some cars are waiting for the junction to clear ( in the non - time - normalized system ) .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    our analysis of the junction will argue that for any @xmath0 , regardless of the initial configuration , the system will reach some optimal speed , depending only on @xmath0 .",
    "first let us state what is this optimal speed :    for a junction with density @xmath0 , the maximal speed for any configuration is @xmath36 .",
    "[ maxspeedthm ]    [ [ proof ] ] proof + + + + +    obviously , the speed can not exceed 1 .",
    "observe the system when it reaches its stable state , and denote the speed by @xmath37 .",
    "thus , at time @xmath38 , a car has advanced @xmath39 steps ( on average ) which means that it has passed the junction @xmath40 times . as only one car",
    "can pass the junction at any time , the total number of cars passing the junction at time @xmath38 is bounded by @xmath38 . therefore , we have @xmath41 which implies @xmath42",
    ". @xmath43    [ [ section-12 ] ]    we will now show that the system necessarily reaches these speeds from any starting configuration .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    we begin by proving that for @xmath8 the junction will eventually reach speed very close to 1 . a system in a stable state",
    "is said to be _ free - flowing _ if no car is ever waiting to enter the junction .",
    "a junction is free - flowing iff the time - normalized junction satisfies :    \\(1 ) for all @xmath45 there is only one car in place @xmath19 in both rows .",
    "\\(2 ) for all @xmath45 if place @xmath19 contains a blue car , place @xmath46    does not contain a red car .",

    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    for this let us consider some configuration and look at the set of `` violations '' to lemma [ violate1 ] , i.e. places that either contain both a blue and a red car , or that contain a blue car and a red car is in the place one to the left . as the following lemma will show , the size of the set of violations is very closely related to the system speed , and posses a very important property : it is non - increasing in time .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    more formally , for a configuration @xmath47 we define two disjoint sets for the two types of violations : @xmath48 @xmath49 also , let @xmath50 be the set of all violations .",

    ".    therefore , @xmath59 .",
    "[ [ section-17 ] ]    for property ( 2 ) we note that in the time - normalized system , following a specific car in the system , its `` current speed '' is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number of times the car was pushed to the left during the last @xmath13 system turns .",
    "we note that if a car at place @xmath90 is pushed to the left at some time @xmath38 , by some violation at place @xmath58 , this violation can reappear only to the left of @xmath90 , so it can push the car again only after @xmath58 passes @xmath90 .",
    "hence any violation can push a car to the left only once in a car s cycle ( i.e. @xmath13 moves ) . since by ( 1 ) at any time from @xmath38 onwards the number of violations in the system is at most @xmath91 , then each car is pushed left only @xmath91 times in @xmath13 turns , so its speed from time @xmath38 onwards is at least @xmath92 as asserted .",
