    "there are several advantages in studying a heavy - light system on a lattice .",
    "our meson is much more simple than in true qcd : one of the quarks is static with the light quark `` orbiting '' it .",
    "this makes it very beneficial for modelling . on the lattice",
    "an abundance of data can be produced , and we know which state we are measuring  the physical states can be a mixture of two or more configurations , but on the lattice this complication is avoided . however , our results on the heavy - light system can still be compared to the @xmath6 meson experimental results .",
    "we have measured both angular and radial excitations of heavy - light mesons , and not just their energies but also some radial distributions . since the heavy quark spin decouples from the game we may label the states as @xmath7 , where l is the angular momentum and @xmath8 is the spin of the light quark .",
    "the measurements were done on a @xmath9 lattice with dynamical clover fermions .",
    "we have two degenerate quark flavours with a mass that is close to the strange quark mass .",
    "the lattice configurations were generated by the ukqcd collaboration .",
    "some details about the different lattices used in this study can be found in table  [ latttable ] .",
    "two different levels of fuzzing ( 2 and 8 iterations of conventional fuzzing ) were used in the spatial directions to permit the extraction of the excited states .",
    ".lattice parameters .",
    "these are ukqcd collaboration s lattices with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the 2-point correlation function ( see figure  [ fig : corr ] a ) is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the heavy ( infinite mass)-quark propagator and @xmath14 the light anti - quark propagator . @xmath15 is a linear combination of products of gauge links at time @xmath16 along paths @xmath17 and @xmath18 defines the spin structure of the operator .",
    "the @xmath19 means the average over the whole lattice .",
    "the energies ( @xmath20 ) and amplitudes ( @xmath21 ) are extracted by fitting the @xmath22 with a sum of exponentials , @xmath23 fuzzing indices have been omitted for clarity .",
    "we introduced two types of smearing in the time direction to allow the stationary quark to move a little , but not too far , from its fixed location .",
    "first we tried ape type smearing , where the original links in the time direction are replaced by a sum over the six staples that extend in the spatial directions ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : smear ] on the left ) .",
    "this smearing is called here `` sum6 '' for short . to smear the static quark even more we then tried hypercubic blocking , again only for the links in the time direction ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : smear ] on the right ) .",
    "now the staples ( the red ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : smear ] ) are not constructed of the original , single links , but from staples ( the blue ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : smear ] ) .",
    "this allows the heavy quark to move within a `` hypercube '' ( the edges of the `` cube '' are 2@xmath0 in spatial directions but only one lattice spacing in the time direction ) .",
    "this smearing is called here `` hyp '' for short .",
    "smearing the heavy quark was expected to improve the measurements , particularly radial distributions - which it did , to some extent .",
    "the energy spectrum obtained is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : espectr ] . using different smearing for",
    "the heavy quark does not seem to change the energies too much - except for the p@xmath24 state .",
    "it is not understood yet why this state should be more sensitive to changes in the heavy quark than the other states we have considered .",
    "the energy of the d@xmath25 state was expected to be near the spin average of the d@xmath26 and d@xmath24 energies , but it turned out to be a poor estimate of this average .",
    "thus it is not clear whether or not the f@xmath25 energy is near the spin average of the two f - wave states , as was hoped .",
    "our earlier results can be foun in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one interesting point to note here is that the spin - orbit splitting of the p - wave states is small , almost zero .",
    "we extracted the energy difference of the p@xmath24 and p@xmath26 states in two different ways :    1 .   indirectly by simply calculating the difference using the energies given by the fits in equation  [ c2fit ] , when the p@xmath24 and p@xmath26 data are fitted separately .",
    "2 .   directly by combining the p@xmath24 and p@xmath26 data ( taking the ratio ) and fitting everything in one go with @xmath27+b\\exp[-m_ct],\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are fit parameters . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energies of the p@xmath26 and p@xmath24 ground states , respectively .",
    "the energy difference , rather than the energies themselves , were varied in the fit .",
    "the second exponential contains the corrections from the excited states .",
    "d - wave spin - orbit splitting was also extracted in a similar manner .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sos ] .",
    "for evaluating the radial distributions of the light quark a 3-point correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] b is needed .",
    "it is defined as @xmath33 this is rather similar to the 2-point correlation function in eq .",
    "[ 2point ] .",
    "we have now two light quark propagators , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and a probe @xmath36 at distance @xmath37 from the static quark ( @xmath38 for the vector ( charge ) and @xmath39 for the scalar ( matter ) distribution ) .    knowing the energies @xmath20 and the amplitudes @xmath21 from the earlier @xmath22 fit , the radial distributions , @xmath40 s , are then extracted by fitting the @xmath41 with @xmath42 the results are plotted in figures  [ s11][dmdistr ] .",
    "the error bars in these figures show statistical errors only .",
    "see @xcite for earlier s - wave distribution calculations .",
    "the `` sum6 '' distributions have been published in @xcite , but the `` hyp '' results are still preliminary .",
    "we are currently trying to improve the analysis of the d - wave radial distribution data .",
    "when measuring a radial distribution it is easy to also measure the sumrule by simply summing over the whole lattice .",
    "our results for the charge sumrule are shown in figure  [ dmdistr ] .",
    "we included the vertex correction @xmath43 , so that with our normalisation the result should be one .",
    "this comes out very nicely for the s - wave , but for the other states we get the sumrule to be somewhat smaller .",
    "a simple model based on the dirac equation is used to try to describe the lattice data .",
    "since the mass of the heavy quark is infinite we have essentially a one - body problem .",
    "the potential in the dirac equation has a linearly rising scalar part , @xmath44 , as well as a vector part @xmath45 .",
    "the one gluon exchange potential , @xmath46 , is modified to @xmath47 where @xmath48  mev and the dynamical gluon mass @xmath49  mev ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the potential also has a scalar term @xmath50 , which is needed to increase the energy of higher angular momentum states .",
    "however , this is only a small contribution ( about 30  mev for the f - wave ) .",
    "the solid lines in the radial distribution plots are predictions from the dirac model fit with @xmath51  gev , @xmath52 , @xmath53  gev / fm , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these are treated as free parameters with the values obtained by fitting the ground state energies of p- , d- and f - wave states and the energy of the first radially excited s - wave state ( 2s ) .",
    "note that the excited state energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : espectr ] were not fitted .",
    "this fit was done using the energies obtained with ape smearing ( `` sum6 '' ) , and the latest `` hyp '' data was not used .",
    "* there is an abundance of lattice data , energies and radial distributions , available . *",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is small and supports the symmetry @xmath56 as proposed in  @xcite . * the energies and radial distributions of s- ,",
    "p- and d - wave states can be qualitatively understood by using a one - body dirac equation model .",
    "i am grateful to my supervisor a. m. green and to our collaborator , professor c. michael .",
    "i wish to thank the ukqcd collaboration for providing the lattice configurations .",
    "i also wish to thank the center for scientific computing in espoo , finland , for making available resources without which this project could not have been carried out .",
