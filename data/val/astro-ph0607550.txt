    "the nature of the galactic center source irs  8 @xcite , one of the brightest compact mid - infrared sources in the central infrared cluster , was unknown until adaptive optics h- and k - band imaging revealed that the bulk of its infrared emission originates in a classic bowshock @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the irs  8 bowshock is a straightforward consequence of the interaction of a dense and high velocity wind from a hot star that is traversing moderately dense interstellar gas .",
    "adaptive optics imaging on large telescopes easily resolves the central star of irs  8 ( hereafter irs  8 * ) from the bowshock .    that stars undergoing mass loss within the interstellar medium in the galactic center produce bowshock - like structures of swept - up gas",
    "had already been suggested from observations of irs  21 by @xcite and , by analogy , for a number of other luminous mid - infrared sources in the northern arm .",
    "this has now been observationally verified @xcite and additional examples of the phenomenon have been found @xcite .",
    "thus irs  8 is the most graphic example of a common phenomenon in the galactic center that may also include a large number of lower luminosity sources with less massive winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of its large angular dimensions , fortuitous orientation , and relatively isolated location , spectroscopy of irs  8 at high angular resolution can provide information both on the nature of the stellar source of the wind and the properties of the wind and the interstellar medium in the galactic center . here",
    "we describe exploratory low resolution k - band spectroscopy of irs  8 * and its bowshock .",
    "k - band spectra of irs  8 were obtained on ut 2004 june 9 and 2005 august 21 at the frederick gillett gemini telescope on mauna kea , in photometric conditions .",
    "the gemini adaptive optics module altair was used to feed niri , the facility near - infrared imager and spectrograph , with a near - diffraction limited view of the irs  8 region .",
    "the adaptive optics correction was performed on a v@xmath014  mag star 13  @xmath1 distant from irs  8*. niri was configured with a 0.10  slit and a k grism to cover the 1.9 - 2.4  @xmath2 m wavelength interval with resolving power of 900 .",
    "the plate scale was 0.0219  pixel@xmath3 .",
    "exposures were obtained with irs  8 * alternately positioned at two locations along the slit , separated by 3@xmath1 .",
    "the slit was oriented east - west on the sky and thus intersected the bow shock a few tenths of an arcsecond south - southeast of its apex , as shown in fig .",
    "1 .    spectra of both irs  8 * ( covering 6 rows of the array ) and the bow shock ( covering 7 rows of the array centered 0.24  east of the star were extracted from the best quality subtracted pairs of flatfielded and despiked spectral images , and were then coadded to produce final raw spectra .",
    "only the 2005 data consisting of 30 minutes of exposure time are shown here . in the initial data reduction",
    "the spectra of irs  8 * and the bowshock were ratioed by the spectrum of hr  7038 ( f5v , observed immediately after irs  8) , following artificial removal ( via interpolation ) of the br  @xmath4 line in its extracted spectrum .",
    "prior to ratioing a slight smoothing was applied to all coadded spectra , resulting in a final resolving power of 870 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 350  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the wavelength scale was calibrated using telluric absorption lines in the spectrum of hr  7038 , and is accurate to 0.0003  @xmath2 m ( 40  km  s@xmath3 , 2@xmath5 ) .",
    "examination of the intensity profile of the spectral images along the slit indicated that contamination by the spectrum of the surrounding bowshock contributed significantly to the spectrum of irs  8 * , e.g. , 25@xmath65 percent at 2.2  @xmath2 m .",
    "this contamination was subtracted from the irs  8 * spectrum to produce the final spectrum . as the spectrum of the bowshock is smooth in the vicinity of almost all of the lines reported below in irs  8 * , and because the bowshock is both fainter than irs  8 * at all but the longest wavelengths in the spectrum and percentage - wise a minor contaminant , the above uncertainty in the percentage of the bowshock spectrum to be subtracted has a negligible effect on the strengths of these lines and results in only a small increase in the noise level .",
    "figure 2 contains the reduced spectra of both the star and the bowshock .",
    "cancellation of the strong telluric band of co@xmath7 near 2.01  @xmath2 m was poor and thus that portion of the spectra is omitted in the figure .",
    "in addition , as can be seen by the similar structures near the long wavelength ends of the two spectra , accuracy in the 2.27 - 2.33  @xmath2 m regions of the spectra is limited by systematic errors in telluric line removal . over the bulk of each spectrum",
    ", however , the fluctuations appears to be random .",
    "the spectrum of the bowshock is a steeply rising continuum with weak and narrow he  i singlet and h  i br  @xmath4 emission lines present near 2.059  @xmath2 m and 2.166  @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of the central star has a considerably less steep continuum and clearly contains several weak emission lines in the 2.07 - 2.12  @xmath2 m interval , but neither of the emission lines seen in the bowshock .",
    "a more careful data reduction of the spectrum of irs  8 * was performed by dividing the spectrum as before by the standard with the straight line interpolation at br  @xmath4 , but then multiplying by the normalized f5v standard spectrum from @xcite at all wavelengths except in the br  @xmath4 region prior to decontamination . by doing this subtle emission features in the reduced spectrum resulting from weak absorption lines in hr  7038",
    "are removed . because the strong br  @xmath4 lines in hr  7038 and in the template do not quite match ,",
    "we have used a straight line interpolation there .",
    "the spectrum resulting from this reduction method is used in the remainder of this paper .    from @xcite",
    "the extinction in the general vicinity of irs  8 is @xmath8@xmath028  mag .",
    "when the spectrum of irs  8 * is dereddened by this amount the continuum is noticeably redder than the rayleigh - jeans spectral falloff of a hot star .",
    "thus either the fully reduced and dereddened stellar spectrum is still considerably contaminated by emission from dust ( despite our removal of contamination as described previously ) or the extinction to irs  8 * is somewhat larger than the value inferred from the extinction map of @xcite .",
    "we suspect the latter and that fine spatial structure in the extinction is the most likely cause of the discrepancy .",
    "to estimate the extinction at irs  8 * we compared the dereddened stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with those from our theoretical models of the irs  8 * spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "the best match was obtained for a value of a@xmath9=33  mag .",
    "values differing from this by @xmath101.5  mag failed to reasonably reproduce the observed slope of the sed . from our estimate of k=13.3 for irs  8",
    "* based on these data we obtain a dereddened k=9.50  mag or m@xmath11=-5.0  mag for an assumed distance of 8  kpc to the galactic center .    the reduced and dereddened 2.04 - 2.27  @xmath2 m spectrum of irs  8 * is shown in fig .  3 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio , estimated from the fluctuations in lineless parts of the spectrum , varies with wavelength but is never far from 100 in a resolution element ( @xmath00.0025  @xmath2 m ) ; it is highest from 2.21 to 2.27  @xmath2 m .",
    "the narrow emission features near 2.1  @xmath2 m have peaks at 2.070  @xmath2 m , 2.080  @xmath2 m , 2.106  @xmath2 m , and 2.116  @xmath2 m .",
    "these features are respectively identified as : c iv ( 2.0705  @xmath2 m ; c iv 2.0796  @xmath2 m ) ; a blend of nearly coincident c iii and n iii lines at 2.1038  @xmath2 m and 2.1081  @xmath2 m ; and nearly coincident c iii , n iii and o iii contributions at 2.1152  @xmath2 m , 2.1155  @xmath2 m , 2.1156  @xmath2 m and 2.1162 - 69  @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "all wavelengths are _ in vacuo_. the he  i lines at 2.1126  @xmath2 m and 2.1138",
    "@xmath2 m are very weak and embedded within the emission feature at 2.116  @xmath2 m ( see discussion below ) . an additional weak but",
    "statistically significant emission feature is present at 2.247  @xmath2 m and is identified as the stronger and shorter wavelength member of an n  iii doublet that has previously been seen in late wn stars @xcite and perhaps is also weakly present in the o stars observed by @xcite .",
    "the statistically significant absorption feature at 2.190  @xmath2 m is he ii 10 - 7 .",
    "the he i 2@xmath12p-2@xmath12s line is weakly in absorption at 2.059  @xmath2 m .",
    "all of these features except for the last are also clearly detected in the spectrum of irs  8 * obtained in 2004 june .",
    "the br  @xmath4 line is not detected and its integrated equivalent width must be very small .",
    "at the location of irs  8 @xcite identified two velocity components in the ne  ii line at 12.8  @xmath2 m , one at -10  km  s@xmath3 which is localized at irs  8 and the other centered near + 110  km  s@xmath3 associated with the northern arm .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios of the lines in the irs  8 * spectrum are not high and the resolving power is low ; hence the radial velocities of the lines can not be determined accurately . nevertheless , we can draw some limited conclusions from our model fits ( see section 3.3 ) to the observed spectrum",
    ". fits to the 2.07 - 2.12  @xmath2 m complex of lines gives -10  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "fits to the he absorption lines give + 30  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the mean value of these is + 10  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the strong br  @xmath4 line in the bowshock is centered at -40  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "all of these values match the radial velocity of the more negative component of the ne  ii line to within the uncertainties .",
    "we thus conclude that the blueshifted ne  ii component seen by @xcite is associated with irs  8 * and suspect that it arises in gas that has been swept up by the wind from irs  8*. apparently , the northern arm is not interacting with irs  8 and thus irs  8 * lies either well in front of it or behind it .",
    "the relatively small equivalent widths of the emission lines in the spectrum of irs  8 * indicate that the star is an ob type rather than a wolf - rayet type .",
    "a very few wc9 stars with weak 2  @xmath2 m lines have been found by @xcite ; however , the lines are considerably broader than observed here .",
    "the isolated c  iv lines in irs  8 * have widths that are only marginally broader than the velocity resolution of 350  km  s@xmath3 , indicating that the intrinsic full widths at half maximum ( fwhms ) of the lines are not larger than 200  km  s@xmath3 , consistent with rotational velocities found for o stars with lines originating at the photosphere .",
    "the presence of the two helium lines in absorption suggests that the star is either an of or wnl type @xcite , but the latter classification is unrealistic as the carbon lines at 2.07  @xmath2 m and 2.08  @xmath2 m are prominent .",
    "thus we are confident that we are observing an o star .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite have developed an infrared classification scheme for ob stars , based on spectra in the h window and short wavelength half of the k window , which is useful for hot stars that suffer large extinctions .",
    "figure  3 is a comparison of the irs  8 * k - band spectrum with online - available k - band spectra from the @xcite catalog for o stars ranging from o4 to o6.5 and different luminosity classes .",
    "the resolving powers for all template spectra have been degraded to 800 for direct comparison with the observed spectrum .    from fig .",
    "3 we judge that irs  8 * falls within the o5-o6.5 and iii - if ranges , with likely o5-o6  if spectral type and luminosity class . for stars earlier than o5-o6if the c  iii / n  iii lines become much weaker while the strengths of the c  iv lines are considerably reduced for both earlier and later spectral types . in addition , in cooler stars he i usually begins to develop a noticeable absorption at 2.113  @xmath2 m ( see @xcite for further objects with later spectral type ) , but this line is not detected in irs  8*. a similar trend is observed in the he  i line at 2.059  @xmath2 m line , as its absorption strength clearly increases toward later types .",
    "two spectral features may be used to determine the luminosity class : the emission feature at 2.116  @xmath2 m and br  @xmath4 . from fig .",
    "3 we see that for a given spectral type the emission strength of the 2.116  @xmath2 m feature is larger for supergiants than for dwarfs .",
    "also emission in the strong stellar winds present in the supergiants starts to fill the br  @xmath4 photospheric absorption profile to drive this line into emission as opposed to the clean absorption profile observed for giants and dwarfs .",
    "further constraints on the spectral type of irs  8 * might come from measurements of the ionization state of the surrounding gas using mid - infrared fine structure lines of ions with a diagnostic range of ionization potentials .",
    "@xcite found from observations of the ne  ii , ar  iii , and s  iv lines that the overall ionization state in the central parsec of the galaxy is consistent with excitation by stars with @xmath13  @xmath14  35,000  k. if that constraint applies to irs  8 the earlier o spectral subtypes in the above range could be ruled out .",
    "the ne  ii line intensity at irs  8 has been measured and is strong , but searches for the ar  iii and s  iv lines at irs  8 have not been reported .",
    "given the strong spectral similarities of irs  8 * with the o5 - 6 supergiants in cyg  ob2 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , we computed model fits covering that parameter domain , drawing from our analysis of the cyg  ob2 stars for which uv , optical and ir spectra are available ( * ? ? ? * najarro et al . in preparation ) . to perform quantitative analysis we utilized the iterative , non - lte line blanketing method presented by @xcite and proceeded as described in @xcite , also taking into account the effects of the fe  iv lines close to the wavelength of the he  i 2.06  @xmath2 m line @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for a detailed discussion of the code .",
    "our best - fitting model is displayed in fig .  3 ( dashed line ) and reproduces the observed k - band spectrum of irs  8 * quite well .",
    "although the observed k band flux and low resolution spectrum are insufficient to tightly constrain all of the stellar properties of a supergiant such as irs  8 * ( higher resolution and other h lines would be required ) , it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of some crucial parameters such as temperature and luminosity and useful constraints on the wind density and metal abundances .    to determine the effective temperature we use he  i / ii ionization balance as the main constraint via the he  i 2.06 and 2.112/3  @xmath2 m lines and the he  ii  2.189  @xmath2 m line . the c  iv lines are considered as secondary t@xmath15 indicators ( see below ) .",
    "the strengths of the absorption components of neutral helium lines display the highest sensitivity to changes in temperature , while the he  ii 2.189  @xmath2 m line also shows strong sensitivity to wind density ( @xmath16 ) . within the parameter domain of interest , for reasonable he enrichment",
    "( e.g. he / h @xmath17 0.25 by number ) , these lines are not highly sensitive to changes in he abundance if the mass loss rate is also adjusted to reproduce br  @xmath4 .",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "when the he abundance increases , the he absorption lines become somewhat stronger . however , to recover the observed br  @xmath4 strength @xmath16",
    "must be increased to compensate for the reduction in the hydrogen abunance .",
    "the higher mass loss rate refills the he absorption components and , therefore , the resulting he profiles do not change significantly .",
    "this situation is reversed when the he abundance is high enough ( he / h  @xmath10  0.25 by number ) as both effects , enhancement of he abundance and increased @xmath16 , drive the he lines into emission . from the above ,",
    "we obtain t@xmath15=36000 @xmath6 2000 , log  @xmath18/l@xmath19 = 5.6 @xmath6 0.2 ( set by the derived t@xmath15 and the observed k magnitude ) , and 0.10  @xmath17  he / h  @xmath170.25 by number .    the error estimate for the effective temperature may seem small , but we are confident of the robustness of the derived value given the strong sensitivity of the he  i absorption components and the he  ii line together with the presence of the c  iv lines . for temperatures above 38000  k the",
    "he  i lines absorption components disappear while they clearly become too strong for effective temperatures below 34000  k. likewise , the he  ii line starts to fade for temperatures below our quoted range and gets too strong in absorption for temperatures above it .",
    "is also important to note that , for the relevant parameter domain , the he  i / ii lines react only minorly to changes on the surface gravity .",
    "the error in the stellar luminosity reflects those in the effective temperature , extinction , contribution of the bow - shock spectrum and the uncertainty in the flux calibration .",
    "the br  @xmath4 line is strongly sensitive to wind density , clumping , and velocity field , and to a lesser extent to gravity .",
    "since we do not have diagnostics for the terminal velocity to constrain the wind density , we adopt a typical value , 2500  km  s@xmath3 , found for other galactic o5if stars @xcite .",
    "further , the spectral resolution is not high enough to clearly constrain either the shape of the velocity field ( e.g. , the @xmath20 parameter * ? ? ? * ) or the clumping factor ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus , depending on the adopted @xmath20 and he abundance we obtained clumping scaled mass loss rates @xmath22 in the range4.56.2  @xmath23  m@xmath24  yr@xmath3 . for our models",
    "we assumed a clumping factor of @xmath21=0.15 , based on our experience of modeling the cyg  ob2 objects , and hence the resulting mass - loss rates ranged from 1.75 to 2.45  @xmath25m@xmath24  yr@xmath3 for the adopted @xmath20 and terminal velocity .",
    "likewise , the lack of cleaner diagnostic lines for gravity such as the brackett series lines in the h - band , hampers the determination of log  g. models with gravities above log  g=3.70 started to fail to reproduce the spectrum .",
    "reasonable fits were obtained for models with log  g=3.403.60 .",
    "the c  iv lines were utilized as a secondary temperature diagnostic ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as they not only depend quite strongly on temperature , but also on wind density , carbon abundance , gravity and the @xmath20 parameter . if none of the above parameters are precisely determined , the uncertainty in the carbon abundance may be as high as a factor of three . in the case of irs  8 * currently acceptable values for the carbon abundance range from 0.25@xmath26  solar to 0.6  @xmath27  solar .",
    "the n  iii doublet at 2.25  @xmath2 m reacts mainly to nitrogen abundance and only slightly to effective temperature within the parameter domain of interest and thus constitutes an excellent diagnostic of the nitrogen abundance ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the weakness of this feature relative to the noise level results in a relatively high uncertainty in the lower limit to the nitrogen abundance .",
    "we estimate an enrichment of roughly 5  @xmath27  solar with 7.5  @xmath27  solar and 2.5  @xmath27  solar as reasonable upper and lower limits respectively .",
    "the strong emission feature at 2.116  @xmath2 m in irs  8 * is of particular interest . in the past",
    "this feature , which is present over a very wide range of o spectral types and luminosities @xcite has been attributed to c  iii and n  iii n=87 transitions .",
    "we tried to reproduce this feature with the carbon and nitrogen abundances derived from the c  iv 2.07 - 2.08  @xmath2 m and n  iii 2.25  @xmath2 m lines and missed more than half of the observed equivalent width of the feature .",
    "increasing either the carbon or the nitrogen abundance to match the 2.116  @xmath2 m feature resulted in far too strong lines of c  iv at 2.07 - 2.08  @xmath2 m and/or n  iii at 2.25  @xmath2 m .",
    "this result is confirmed by inspection of the dominant ions of these species within the atmospheric region where the above lines form .",
    "carbon is largely divide between c  iv and c  v , so the c  iii lines are too weak even with a large increase in the carbon abundance .",
    "the dominant ions of nitrogen and oxygen are n  iv and o  iv and hence the n  iii and o  iii recombination lines are reliable diagnostics for deriving abundances .",
    "hence , we now believe that the 2.116  @xmath2 m feature in irs  8 * is dominated by o  iii n=87 transitions . after extending our o  iii model atom to account for these transitions we could satisfactorily reproduce the observations ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "further , the o  iii component of the 2.116  @xmath2 m feature largely depends on the oxygen abundance and only slightly on gravity , effective temperature , wind density , and velocity field .",
    "thus , this feature may be a powerful diagnostic of oxygen abundance , and therefore an important metal abundance determiner , over a wide range of o spectral types ( najarro et al . in preparation ) . using it we obtain an oxygen abundance of 0.8 to 1.1@xmath26  solar in irs  8 * , which indicates solar metallicity for the cloud in which irs  8 * formed .    to summarize this subsection , the stellar parameters t@xmath15 , l , @xmath28 , and log g are fully compatible with oif supergiants ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and confirm the nature of irs  8 * derived from classification schemes .",
    "the derived n / c and n / o ratios reveal partial cno processing at the surface of irs  8 and are consistent with the values expected for an o supergiant if rotational mixing has taken place .",
    "@xcite used the measured standoff distance of the bowshock from the star together with a rough estimate of the particle density ( @xmath29  =  10@xmath30  @xmath31 ) of the ambient interstellar medium in the galactic center and typical values of windspeed ( 10@xmath30  km  s@xmath3 and mass loss rate in a hot star ( 10@xmath32m@xmath24  yr@xmath3 ) to estimate a space velocity @xmath33 for irs  8 * of 150  km  s@xmath3 , which is a reasonable value in the galactic center .",
    "the standoff distance is proportional to ( @xmath34  @xmath35  /  @xmath29  @xmath33@xmath36)@xmath37 , where @xmath34 is the mass loss rate and @xmath35 is the wind speed .",
    "the values of @xmath35 and @xmath34 used in the above modelling suggest that in order to produce the observed standoff distance @xmath29 would need to approach 10@xmath38  @xmath31 , which would not be surprising .",

    "this is clearly at odds both with the current estimate for the age of the galactic center cluster and with the abundance pattern derived from our models .",

    "then the current position in the hr diagram corresponds to a star with a zams mass of 44.5  m@xmath24 and an age of 3.5  myr . such a star would show cno - processed material on its surface . except for the age , still well below the estimate obtained by @xcite using non - rotating models for a single burst scenario , the stellar parameters , including the abundance pattern , are fully consistent with those derived from our modelling .    the crucial question thus is whether this star is really much younger than the cluster and probes the existence of ongoing ( or at least much more recent ) star formation , or if on the contrary the star is either an impostor or a cluster member that underwent a rejuvenation cure . a possible way out",

    "models for massive close binaries have been developed by @xcite to explain the optical counterparts of massive x - ray binaries . using these models",
    "we have found that for a massive close binary system with initial masses of 25  m@xmath24 and 24  m@xmath24 ( their model 10a ) the current position of irs  8 * may be elegantly explained without violating the age of the galactic center cluster .",
    "similar scenarios are a possible explanation for some of the overluminous he  i objects in the central parsec .",
    "the solid lines in fig .  4 correspond to the evolution of the primary ( grey ) and secondary ( black ) components of the massive close binary system .",
    "the thick solid line displayed on the track of the secondary corresponds to the phase where the primary is at least 10 times less bright in @xmath40 than the secondary .",
    "the observed location of irs  8 * in the hr diagram is reached after 7.1  myrs , which is consistent with the @xmath41  myr estimate from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at this stage the surface enrichment displayed by the secondary shows excellent agreement with the values derived in our model . for this particular massive close binary model",
    "the primary has not exploded yet , as otherwise the secondary would be already halfway through core helium burning and would have a much lower effective temperature .",
    "however , models with a slightly more massive primary and a slightly less massive secondary ( n. langer , private communication ) could also reproduce the elemental abundances and current position of irs  8 * in the hr diagram after the explosion of the primary ( at @xmath06  myr ) and , in addition , could have provided a kick to the secondary , placing it at its current position outside the central 0.5  pc .",
    "the spectroscopic mass of irs  8 * is in the range 2337  m@xmath24 ( for log  g 3.403.60 ) , although the range could be larger , bearing in mind the uncertainties in determining the stellar gravity , as discussed previously .",
    "from the evolutionary models of @xcite , the current mass of irs  8 * is 38  m@xmath24 for a single star evolution with rotation , and thus consistent with the highest values of spectroscopic mass .",
    "likewise , in the close binary scenario , the current mass of irs  8 * ( after consuming a significant fraction of its companion ) is 3640  m@xmath24 .",
    "future spectra at higher resolution than presented here should be able to test if irs  8 * is part of a close binary . if irs  8 * is single its origin is highly uncertain .",
    "it is then either an impostor in the central parsec or it is a loosely associated member of the central cluster of hot and massive stars .",
    "the current motion of irs  8 * , nearly directly away from the center ( as judged by the orientation of the bowshock and low radial velocity ) , suggests that it passes close to sgr  a * @xcite and may once have been a member of central cluster . if so it might be that a small population of less evolved and less luminous mid - late o type stars with weak emission lines such as those of irs  8 * are still hidden within the cluster , which could challenge the current understanding of that cluster as having a common age @xcite .",
