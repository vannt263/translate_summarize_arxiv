    "this emission will become optically thin , and it will flatten up to @xmath45 . in that case , the excess of emission at 22 ghz will be even higher . alternatively , it is possible that the emission at 22ghz includes a contribution additional to free - free radiation from the photoionized nebula , such as a central ionized disk @xcite , a collimated wind @xcite , or circumstellar dust @xcite .",

    "note that we did not obtain the magnetic field strength of the weak maser component at the velocity of @xmath055.3 kms@xmath2  from the first epoch , as the signal to noise ratio for this maser is low , and as such the splitting has low statistical significance .",

    "the presence of maser emission ( oh or h@xmath1o ) in a pn is usually considered to be a sign of its youth , since these masers are expected to disappear shortly after the end of the agb phase @xcite .",
    "@xcite find the sizes and optical visibilities of the maser - associated pne suggest a range of ages , but it is possible that the subgroup of pne showing both oh and h@xmath1o are among the youngest pne known @xcite .",
    "our observations confirm iras 16333@xmath04807 as a member of this rare group of potentially young pne .",
    "so far , in addition to iras 16333@xmath04807 , only k 3@xmath035 @xcite , iras 17347@xmath03139 @xcite , and possibly iras 17347@xmath03139 @xcite show maser emission from both molecules .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the radio continuum emission can also provide some information about the evolutionary stage of the source . as mentioned in section",
    "[ continuum ] , the radio continuum spectrum is compatible with free - free radiation , and it is similar to that seen in other pne @xcite .",
    "there seems to be a turnover frequency of @xmath37ghz , where the opacity regime changes from optically thick to optically thin emission .",
    "the turnover frequency is directly related to the emission measure of the ionized region . in this case",
    ", we derive an emission measure of 1.9@xmath47 pc@xmath48 obtained from the free - free opacity @xmath49 , with @xmath50 at @xmath51ghz and assuming a typical equilibrium temperature of t@xmath52 k. compared to the other pne with oh and h@xmath1omasers , the turnover frequency in iras 16333@xmath04807 is lower .",
    "this frequency is @xmath1210ghz for k 3@xmath035 @xcite , and @xmath53ghz for iras 17347@xmath03139 @xcite .",
    "this means that the emission measure of the ionized gas seems to be lower in iras 16333@xmath04807 .",
    "a high emission measure could be a signature of youth @xcite .",
    "therefore , assuming that the central stars in the group of pne with both oh and h@xmath1o masers have similar characteristics , the turnover frequency suggests that iras 16333@xmath04807 is somewhat more evolved than k 3@xmath035 and iras 17347@xmath03139 .",
    "the most striking characteristic of iras 16333@xmath04807 is the presence of oh maser emission at 1720mhz , and that this emission is stronger than the other ground - state oh transitions .",
    "it was proposed by @xcite that strong 1720mhz maser emission can only be produced by means of collisional pumping under particular physical conditions with t@xmath54 @xmath55 200 k and n@xmath56 10@xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "it is likely a shock is required to produce 1720mhz oh masers , as has been found in the case of snrs .",
    "however , strong ( j - type ) shocks tend to break apart molecules , which then reform behind the shock front , but do not produce sufficient column for masers to appear during the rapid cooling phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , c - type shocks are more likely to be conducive to maser conditions .",
    "@xcite showed that in the presence of strong magnetic fields , shocks would be of the non - dissociative c - type , due to the interaction of the ions upstream from the shock front with the magnetic field .",
    "this appears to be a valid mechanism for producing such shocks in iras 16333@xmath04807 , since we do measure significant magnetic fields , of order a few milligauss .",
    "the other ground - state oh maser transitions are excited radiatively .",
    "iras 16333@xmath04807 also harbours h@xmath1omasers , which can be excited in c - shocks @xcite .",
    "our measurement of zeeman splitting in the 1720mhz transition is consistent with this maser being pumped in a magnetized environment .",
    "the magnetic field strength of the @xmath060.7 kms@xmath2  component at the first epoch is comparable to that of the @xmath055.1 kms@xmath2  component at the second epoch within the errors ( table [ magtable ] ) , which suggests that they are tracing the same structure .",
    "it is believed that pne are shaped by jets ejected during the post - agb phase , which carve cavities in the circumstellar envelope @xcite .",
    "these jets obviously create shocks , which can power maser emission .",
    "this is clearly seen in the case of the post - agb stars called `` water fountains '' , in which h@xmath1omasers trace collimated jets @xcite .",
    "if the oh masers at 1720mhz in iras 16333@xmath04807 were pumped by jets , we would expect them to be associated with the lobes of the pn",
    ". this could be the case for the 1720mhz maser at @xmath4622.9 kms@xmath2 .",
    "however , most of these masers , and the overall distribution of all oh and h@xmath1o masers ( fig.[contour ] ) seem to trace an equatorial structure , perpendicular to the lobes .",
    "this could be related to the low - velocity equatorial flows seen in some `` water fountains '' @xcite and the toroidal distribution of h@xmath1omasers in other maser - emitting pne @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the 1720mhz oh maser spots and the presence of clear zeeman pairs suggest that oh emission at 1720mhz in iras 16333@xmath04807 arises from an energetic ejection of material along the equatorial plane , probably in the form of an expanding , magnetized torus .",
    "note that k 3@xmath035 , the other pn showing maser emission at 1720mhz , has also been inferred to host a magnetized disk @xcite .",
    "these equatorial ejections could be created , for instance , by binary interactions @xcite .",
    "magnetized equatorial structures traced by maser emission have also been found in post - agb stars @xcite , with similar values for the derived magnetic field as the ones found in pne ( * ? ? ? * and this paper ) .",
    "this suggests that the characteristics of the magnetic field do not significantly evolve in the transition to the pn phase @xcite .",
    "the presence of oh emission at 1720mhz could be the hallmark of a particular phase of pn evolution , characterized by energetic equatorial ejections .",
    "the extreme rarity of this emission in evolved stars suggests that this phase is very short , or that energetic equatorial ejections only happen in the form of recurrent , but short - lived events during the early pn phase .",
    "it is interesting to note the different velocity pattern and magnetic field properties of the oh maser emission at 1720mhz , compared with the other oh transitions ( fig.[spec ] , [ lr ] ) and the h@xmath1o emission @xcite .",
    "the emission of all these other transitions clusters around @xmath59 kms@xmath2 , while oh emission at 1720mhz shows components both red- and blue - shifted with respect to that velocity . if the 1720mhz masers are tracing an expanding torus",
    ", its expansion velocity would be at least @xmath60 kms@xmath2  ( half of the maximum velocity spread of the maser components ) .",
    "the oh masers at 1612 and 1667mhz , as well as the h@xmath1o masers seem to be closer to the star ( fig.[contour ] ) , but these masers have lower relative velocities than those at 1720mhz . if the maser transitions arise from the same equatorial structure , this velocity pattern may indicate that the expansion velocities are higher at the outer parts of the torus , which would be expected if the ejection had an explosive nature . alternatively , it could be a projection effect , if the oh masers at 1720mhz tend to trace the expansion along the line of sight , and the other maser transitions are seen in regions expanding along the plane of the sky .",
    "this could happen if the velocity gradient is very high in the central regions , which would not favour the maser amplification along the line of sight .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field is stronger in the region emitting at 1720mhz than for the other oh masers , which suggests that these transitions are pumped in regions with significantly different magnetic properties .",
    "this suggests that the different velocity patterns in these oh transitions are not merely projection effects , but that the 1720mhz masers are selectively tracing the energetic ejection of an equatorial magnetized structure .",
    "further observations should be undertaken to obtain a better understanding of the source .",
    "k 3@xmath035 was the only known pn showing 1720mhz oh masers before our work on iras 16333@xmath04807 .",
    "since k 3@xmath035 and iras 16333@xmath04807 are the only pne showing oh emission at 1720mhz , we carry out a comparison between the two sources , to understand whether they can define a special group of sources in terms of common physical characteristics .",
    "the ground - state oh maser emission , however , show significant differences between both sources :    \\(1 ) k 3@xmath035 has multiple spectral components in the 1612 and 1667mhz transitions and only one spectral component at 1720mhz , while iras 16333@xmath04807 shows the opposite behaviour with only one spectral component at 1612 and 1667mhz and multiple spectral components at 1720mhz .",
    "\\(2 ) in k 3@xmath035 , the spatial distribution of the masers at 1720mhz is more compact than the 1612 and 1667mhz masers , while in iras 16333@xmath04807 , the 1720mhz",
    "oh maser components are more extended .",
    "\\(3 ) the velocity structure of the masers in these sources is more difficult to determine , since the stellar velocity is highly uncertain in both cases . in iras 16333@xmath04807 , we assume a stellar velocity of @xmath61 kms@xmath2(section [ maser ] ) . under this assumption ,",
    "oh masers at 1612 and 1667mhz would be close to the stellar velocity , and there are both red- and blue - shifted components of emission at 1720mhz . in the case of k 3@xmath035 ,",
    "we favour a stellar velocity of @xmath62 kms@xmath2 , based on optical spectroscopy @xcite , rather than the + 23 kms@xmath2quoted by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on the presence of a broad co component at that velocity @xcite .",
    "interferometric co observations @xcite show that the gas at + 23 kms@xmath2is located west of the central star , while the emission centered at k 3@xmath035 is between + 9 and + 18 kms@xmath2 . under this assumption ( stellar velocity of + 10 kms@xmath2 ) , the emission at 1667mhz and the strongest component at 1612mhz are close to the stellar velocity , while 1665 and 1720mhz emission is red - shifted . additional components of oh at 1612mhz are both red- and blue - shifted .",
    "all this indicates a complicated kinematic pattern , but no clear similarity between k 3@xmath035 and iras 16333@xmath04807 arises .",
    "these spectral , spatial and kinematic differences may be caused by different mass - loss processes in these two pne .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that they reflect a time variation in intrinsically similar processes , such as recurrent episodes of mass loss .",
    "monitoring of the oh emission in these sources may help to clarify this issue .",
    "oh maser emission at 1612 , 1667 and 1720mhz have been detected toward the pn iras 16333@xmath04807 .",

    "<S> we report on oh maser emission toward g336.644@xmath00.695 ( iras 16333@xmath04807 ) , which is a h@xmath1omaser - emitting planetary nebula ( pn ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected 1612 , 1667 and 1720mhz oh masers at two epochs using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , hereby confirming it as the seventh known case of an oh - maser - emitting pn . </S>",
    "<S> this is only the second known pn showing 1720mhz oh masers after k 3@xmath035 and the only evolved stellar object with 1720mhz oh masers as the strongest transition . </S>",
    "<S> this pn is one of a group of very young pne . </S>",
    "<S> the 1612mhz and 1667mhz masers are at a similar velocity to the 22ghz h@xmath1omasers , whereas the 1720mhz masers show a variable spectrum , with several components spread over a higher velocity range ( up to 36 kms@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect zeeman splitting in the 1720mhz transition at two epochs ( with field strengths of @xmath3 to @xmath4 mg ) , which suggests the oh emission at 1720mhz is formed in a magnetized environment . </S>",
    "<S> these 1720mhz oh masers may trace short - lived equatorial ejections during the formation of the pn . </S>"
