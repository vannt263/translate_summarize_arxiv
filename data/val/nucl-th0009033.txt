    "heavy - ion collisions allow one to pump energy into a nuclear system . in central collisions of equal size nuclei one can also create a significant amount of compression using high energy nuclear beams .",
    "the possibility of studying nuclei far from normal conditions raises the question : can we study phase transitions in nuclei similar , for instance , to the way , one can study phase transition in water ?",
    "this is the subject of the present article .",
    "two important phase transitions are being studied using heavy - ion collisions from medium to very high energies .",
    "one phase transition occurs at densities that are subnormal and at temperatures of a few mev ( 1 mev@xmath0 ) .",
    "nuclei at normal density and zero temperature behave like fermi liquids so that this transition is a liquid to gas phase transition .",
    "the second phase transition of current interest is expected at a much higher temperature ( @xmath1150 mev ) and at a much higher density ( several times normal density ) and will be the subject of intense experimental investigation at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and at cern in the coming decade .",
    "there one expects to see transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma . in very high energy collisions",
    "many new particles are created .",
    "this is a domain very much beyond the limits of non - relativistic quantum mechanics with conservation of particles .",
    "thus , we will not treat this phenomenon at all . instead at an energy scale of tens of mev",
    ", we should be able to stretch or compress pieces of nuclear matter and we expect to see van der waals type of behavior . as a van der waals gas",
    "is considered to be a classic example of a liquid - gas phase transition , we have a situation similar to that in condensed matter physics .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental conditions in the nuclear physics case are quite severe .",
    "the collisions which produce different phases of nuclear matter are over in @xmath2 seconds .",
    "thus , we can not keep matter in an `` abnormal '' state long enough to study the properties .",
    "furthermore , the detectors measure only the products of these collisions where all the final products are in normal states .",
    "we have to extrapolate from the end products to what happened during disassembly .",
    "this is a difficult task which complicates confirmation of theoretical predictions .",
    "this article is written so that it is suitable for nuclear physicists not specialised in the area of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we hope it is also accessible to non nuclear physicists since the ideas are quite general and well - known from statistical physics .",
    "we hope practising heavy - ion collision physicists will also find this a useful reference .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . section ii deals with early theoretical discussions which showed that well established models predict that during disassembly after heavy - ion collisions bulk matter will enter liquid - gas coexistence region provided the beam energies are suitably chosen . in section",
    "iii an experimental overview is provided .",
    "sections iv to ix bring us in contact with some experimental results . here",
    "we show , for example , how estimates of temperature or freeze - out density are extracted from experiments .",
    "sections x to xxii are primarily theoretical . we introduce and develop some models ; some we simply sketch without providing all the details , as that would make the article extremely long .",
    "nuclear matter is an idealised system of equal number of neutrons n and protons z. the system is vary large and the coulomb interaction between protons is switched off . for light nuclei",
    "the coulomb interaction has a very small effect and n = z nuclei have the highest binding energy . as nuclei get bigger the coulomb energy shifts the highest binding energy towards nuclei with n@xmath3z .",
    "this brings into play the symmetry energy which is repulsive and is proportional to ( n - z)@xmath4/(n+z ) .",
    "stable systems are scarce after mass number a = n+z@xmath3260 .",
    "thus no known nuclei approach the limit of nuclear matter . however ,",
    "extrapolation from known nuclei leads one to deduce that nuclear matter has density @xmath5 and binding energy @xmath116 mev / a .",
    "we will choose an equation of state ( eos ) of this idealised nuclear matter to examine if a liquid - gas phase transition can be expected and at what temperature and density .",
    "the following parametrisation , called the skyrme parametrisation for the interaction potential energy , has been demonstrated @xcite to be a good approximation for hartree - fock calculations .",
    "we take the potential energy density arising from nuclear forces to be @xmath6 our unit of length is @xmath7 and unit of energy is mev . in the above @xmath8=0.16@xmath9 , @xmath10 are in mev , @xmath11 is attractive , @xmath12 repulsive and @xmath13 is a parameter .",
    "the constants should be chosen such that in nuclear matter the minimum energy is obtained at @xmath14 with energy e / a=-16 mev .",
    "this fixes two of the three parameters and the third can be obtained by the compressibility coefficient ( nuclear physics has its own unique definition of compressibility coefficient @xmath15 at @xmath8 ) .",
    "the skyrme parametrisation is simple enough that we will write down all the relevant formulae . from eq.(2.1 )",
    "the energy per particle as a function of density @xmath16 at zero temperature is given by @xmath17 in eq.(2.2 ) the last term on the right hand side is the zero - temperature fermi - gas value for kinetic energy .",
    "the pressure due to the interaction at zero or any temperature is @xmath18\\times \\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the condition that @xmath19 minimise at @xmath20 gives @xmath21 the condition that @xmath19 is -16 mev at @xmath8 gives @xmath22",
    "lastly , compressibility is given by @xmath23 the eos for the skyrme parametrisation with @xmath11=-356.8 mev , @xmath12=303.9 mev and @xmath13=7/6 ( this gives @xmath24mev ) is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the figure isotherms",
    "are drawn for various temperatures ( 10 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 15.64 and 17 mev ) .",

    "the similarity with van der waals eos is obvious ; for a more quantitative comparison we refer to jaqaman et .",

    "the isothermals are at temperatures 10 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 15.64 ( critical isotherm ) and 17 mev . the coexistence curve obtained from a maxwell construction is shown .",
    "the vertical line is drawn at assumed freeze - out density 0.04 @xmath26 .",
    "the dot - dash line is obtained by assuming that the excited system expands isentropically ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this is an idealisation .",
    "0.2 in we now describe how in heavy - ion collisions one will sweep across the @xmath27 plane . in heavy - ion collisions one distinguishes between spectators and participants .",
    "imagine two equal ions colliding at zero impact parameter .",
    "some highly excited nucleons are emitted first .",
    "the other nucleons are called participants because each nucleon will collide with at least one nucleon in its path if all nucleons are assumed to move in straight line paths . in peripheral collisions where the impact parameters are non - zero , nucleons outside the overlapping zone",
    "would not have collided with nucleons from the other nucleus .",
    "these `` non - interacting '' nucleons are defined as spectators .",
    "for the same beam energy much more energy is pumped into the participating zone .",
    "there will even be compression in this zone if the excitation is very high .",
    "spectators are only mildly excited .",
    "they are excited for many reasons : highly non - spherical shapes , unfavourable n / z ratios , migration from participants etc .. in general , spectators should have little compression .",
    "both central and peripheral collisions have been studied to find signals of phase transitions .",
    "imagine then , as a result of heavy - ion collisions , nuclear matter has been excited to a high temperature , with or without compression .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "1 we see that the pressure will be positive and matter will begin to expand @xcite . the exit path is hard to guess but the simplest expectation supported by transport models is that it is approximately isentropic in the beginning part of the expansion . however",
    ", if the system reaches the spinodal region , the mean - field description is inappropriate and the system is expected to break up into chunks . in fig .",
    "1 we have nonetheless followed the isentropic trajectory . expansion continues till it reaches a freeze - out volume , a theoretical idealisation .",
    "once the freeze - out volume is reached there is no exchange of matter between different fragments .",
    "since the fragments are still hot , they will get rid of their excitation by evaporation ( sequential two body decays @xcite ) before they reach the detector .",
    "the freeze - out density is significantly lower than the normal density .",
    "it is probably not as low as one - tenth the normal density because interactions between fragments ( except for coulomb forces ) will cease well before that .",
    "the freeze - out density is often a parameter in the theory adjusted to get the best fit and is model dependent .",
    "the ` best ' choice seems to be always less than half the normal density . in fig .",
    "1 we have shown this arbitrarily to be @xmath28 , that is , one - quarter of normal nuclear density .    normally , the eos is drawn with isotherms but some additional insight can be gained by looking at isentrops @xcite . for this",
    "we refer to fig . 2 where we have drawn , for the same skyrme interaction , @xmath29 and @xmath30 but now for constant entropy instead of constant temperature .",
    "= 4.5 in = 5.5 in    0.2 in    fig.2 . for the same skyrme interaction as used in fig.1 , we draw @xmath31 and @xmath30 but now for fixed entropy rather than fixed temperature",
    ". the vertical dashed line is along normal nuclear density .",
    "we consider disassembly of an excited spectator .",
    "if the system starts from @xmath32mev ( entropy 1.86 per particle ) , the initial pressure is positive and it begins to expand ( in this idealisation ) along the isentrop .",
    "the thermal @xmath19 will fall , and to compensate , collective velocity will develop .",
    "this collective velocity will take the system beyond the minimum of @xmath19 and drive it to the region of spinodal instability . for small excitation",
    "energy and entropy(0.76 ) the system starts with positive pressure but does not attain enough collective velocity to reach the spinodal region .",
    "it will de - excite by sequential decay .    0.2 in imagine",
    "then an excited spectator is formed at normal density indicated by the vertical dashed line .",
    "let us focus on two isentrops , @xmath33=1.86 and @xmath33=0.76 .",
    "in the first case the system starts with @xmath32 mev and positive pressure .",
    "it will begin to expand ; the value of `` thermal '' @xmath19 as it expands along the isentrop , drops . for conservation of energy",
    "it must then develop a collective flow .",
    "this collective flow will take it beyond the minimum of @xmath19 and drives it to the spinodal region .",
    "for the isentrop with value 0.76 , even though it starts with positive pressure , it does not gain enough collective energy to drive it to the spinodal region .",
    "it will therefore oscillate around zero pressure and has to de - excite by other means ( two - body decay @xcite ) .",
    "the intermediate case with @xmath33= 1.39 just makes it to the spinodal region .    it is also clear both from fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 that if the starting point is too high ( i.e. , too much excitation energy ) the system will entirely miss the liquid region and probe only the gas region at the time of dissociation .",
    "this was the case at bevalac @xcite ( incident energy in gev ) where the goal of studying heavy - ion reactions was quite different .",
    "while mean - field theory , as described above , easily leads to a liquid - gas phase transition picture , one clearly needs to go much beyond .",
    "there is hardly any observable that one can calculate using mean - field theory alone .",
    "most common experimental observables are the clusters , their compositions , their excitations , velocities etc .",
    "mean - field theory does not give these values although it suggests that the system must break up because of spinodal instability .",
    "however , with the maxwell construction obtained from the mean - field eos one can draw a coexistence curve ( fig . 1 ) and this has experimental relevance . as we will describe in much greater detail later",
    ", one may measure the caloric curve @xcite defined as @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 in heavy ion experiments .",
    "the experiment gives a measure of the specific heat , @xmath36 in the vicinity of temperature 5 mev .",
    "indeed many models ( to be described in later sections ) produce a peak in the specific heat at about this temperature .",
    "the peak is reminiscent of the crossing of the coexistence curve @xcite .",
    "these models are also able to calculate many other observables with reasonable success .",
    "let us refer to fig.1 to see where we would expect to see the peak in mean - field theory .",
    "if we consider the freeze - out density to be 0.04@xmath9 , the intersection of the 0.04@xmath9 line and the coexistence curve suggests a temperature of about 15 mev .",
    "this `` boiling '' temperature will come down if a lower freeze - out density is used but even at one tenth the normal density the boiling temperature is still 12 mev .",
    "since we have used nuclear matter theory , the temperature is expected to be lower due to finite particle number and coulomb interaction . in ref",
    "@xcite and later in @xcite , the effect of finite particle number was estimated to be significant .",
    "in addition we must remember that mean - field theories normally overestimate the critical temperature .",
    "for example , in the ising model , this overestimation is about 50 per cent @xcite . in mean - field thomas - fermi theory that includes the coulomb interaction de _ et .",
    "@xcite find the peak in specific heat at 10 mev for @xmath37sm . without the coulomb interaction , in bulk matter with the same isospin asymmetry as @xmath37sm , the peak is located at 13 mev .",
    "as will be described in greater detail later , both experimental data and more realistic models point to much lower temperature .",
    "thus in mean - field theory interesting things seem to happen at too high a temperature .",
    "experimentally the following features are well known . at excitation energy @xmath38 1 mev / nucleon ,",
    "successive emissions of particles by evaporation of the compound nucleus or its fission are the basic deexcitation mechanisms .",
    "the picture can be justified by saying that there is enough time between successive emissions so that the nucleus can relax ( @xmath39 ) to a new equilibrium state where @xmath40 is the radius of the compound nucleus and @xmath41 is the velocity of sound . at @xmath38 3 mev / nucleon ,",
    "the time interval between successive emissions is comparable with @xmath42 . at excitation energy",
    "comparable to binding energy @xmath43 mev / nucleon the very existence of a long - lived compound nucleus is unlikely which leads to the scenario of an explosion - like process involving the whole nucleus .",
    "this will lead to multiple emission of nuclear fragments of different masses .",
    "this is what is called `` multifragmentation '' where ` multi ' is more than two .",
    "associated with multifragmentation is a term intermediate mass fragment ( imf ) that we will use often .",
    "this refers to particles with charge @xmath44 between 3 and 20 to 30 .",
    "the lower charge limit is set to 3 because of exceptional binding of the alpha particle .",
    "the upper limit is set not to include fission like fragments ; if the nucleus broke up into several chunks in the spinodal region , we could expect some of them to be imf s . in the mean - field scenario",
    "described earlier , multifragmentation is associated with the co - existence region .",
    "thus , it is considered to be the most promising experimental observable to study the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter . however , while phase transition signals will always be weakened by finite particle number effects , multifragmentation is usually found at the appropriate energy and occurs in nuclear collisions even when the thermodynamic limit is not reached .",
    "thus multifragmentation is a more general process than phase transition .    in the co - existence region ,",
    "light particles such as neutrons , hydrogen isotopes ( p , d , t ) and helium isotopes ( @xmath45he , @xmath46he , @xmath47he ) are considered as gas while the imf s are treated as droplet forms of the liquid . in collisions where larger residues remain , they are the liquid remnants from the original colliding nuclei",
    ". since nuclei are two - component systems consisting of neutrons and protons , the isotopic contents of the gas and the liquid phase will be different .",
    "this is specially so when bound nuclei of smaller sizes are usually found along the valley of stability and have nearly equal number of protons and neutrons .",
    "thus if the initial collisions consist of heavy nuclei which have more neutrons than protons , one would expect the excess neutrons to diffuse out to the gas region resulting in a neutron enriched nucleon gas .",
    "this has already been seen in experiments and will be discussed later .",
    "thus a preliminary glimpse of the phase transition in nuclei suggests a much richer structure than what has been implied by nuclear matter alone .",
    "multifragmentation was seen in high - energy proton - nucleus collisions @xcite before systematic studies were undertaken in nucleus - nucleus collisions . for a proton incident on a nucleus",
    "the picture is as follows . shortly after the collision between the proton and the target nucleus ,",
    "several prompt nucleons leave the system and carry off much of the energy of the collision . at low incident proton energies only remnants near the mass of the target are produced . for incident proton energies around 0.5 gev , the system undergoes fission leaving two large fragments . when the incident proton energies are between 1.0 gev and 10 gev , the cross - section for multifragmentation rises by an order of magnitude .",
    "at energies above 20 gev the cross - section becomes independent of energy , reaching the limiting fragmentation region .",
    "systematic studies of multifragmentation have been undertaken using heavy - ion beams since the mid eighties , when these beams became routinely available and large detection arrays were built .",
    "the production of fragments from central collisions reaches a maximum around 100a mev . in the following section we will examine various aspects of the multifragmentation process , which may be employed to signal the liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "most early multifragmentation experiments are inclusive measurements @xcite , i.e. particles are identified with no requirements that other particles from the same event should be detected in coincidence .",
    "these types of experiments do not provide information about the collision dynamics or properties of the emission sources from the nuclear reaction .",
    "since multifragmentation of spectators , produced in peripheral collisions has different characteristics from fragments emitted from the participant zone formed in central collisions , it is important that the emission sources be identified .",
    "there are both advantages and disadvantages of using central or peripheral collisions to find the signals of phase transition . in this section",
    ", the methods used to select central and peripheral collisions will be discussed .      in central collisions ,",
    "the excitation energy pumped into the participant zone is higher and the source characteristics , i.e. selection of a single source , can be accomplished easily with large detector arrays which provide nearly 4@xmath48 angular coverage .",
    "intuitively , one expects more particles to be produced in violent or central collisions than peripheral collisions .",
    "thus the number of emitted particles can be related to the collision geometry and the simplest observable is the number of charged particles detected , @xmath49 .",
    "there are variations of the observable @xmath49 , such as the hydrogen multiplicity , @xmath50 or light charge particle multiplicity , @xmath51 .",
    "all these observables work reasonably well in distinguishing central collisions with small impact parameters from peripheral collisions @xcite .",
    "however , the neutron multiplicity , @xmath52 @xcite and the imf multiplicity , @xmath53 @xcite do not work as well . aside from multiplicities , there are other observables such as the mid - rapidity charge , @xmath54 , @xcite and the total transverse kinetic energy , @xmath55 , of the identified particles @xcite , which can be used as an impact parameter filter .",
    "@xmath54 is the summed charge of particles with rapidity between that of the target and projectile .",
    "this quantity reflects properties of the participant zone .",
    "the total transverse energy is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 denote the kinetic energy , momentum and emission angle of particle @xmath59 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the most common way to relate an experimental observable to the impact parameter is to assume a monotonic relationship between the observable and the impact parameter @xcite . in general , a reduced impact - parameter scale , @xmath60 which ranges between 0 ( head - on collisions ) to 1 ( glancing collisions ) , is defined as @xmath61dx')^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the normalized probability distribution for the measured quantity @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the maximum impact parameter for which particles were detected in the near @xmath65 detection array .    for illustration of the impact parameter determination",
    ", the top panel of fig.3 shows the charged particle multiplicity distribution of the @xmath66kr induced reaction on @xmath67au at 35 mev per nucleon incident energy @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows the relationship between the reduced impact parameter , @xmath60 , and @xmath49 with a lower cut of @xmath68 applied in the analysis .    0.2 in    = 4.5 in = 5.5 in    0.2 in    fig . 3 : ( top ) charged particle multiplicity distribution of the @xmath66kr induced reaction on @xmath67au at 35 mev per nucleon incident energy .",
    "( bottom ) @xmath60 as a function of @xmath49 @xcite .    0.2 in    while @xmath49 is the most simple observable to measure the impact parameters , it is not very precise due to fluctuations and geometric efficiencies of the detection device . in cases where the single source from the central collision needs",
    "to be better defined or determined , additional constraints are applied . in head - on collisions ,",
    "the angular momentum transfer is zero and all the emitted particles are emitted isotropically in the azimuthal angle @xcite .",
    "thus additional constraints on central collisions can be placed by requiring the detected particles to have isotropic emission pattern .",
    "other constraints include requiring the total charge detected to be a substantial fraction of that of the initial system @xcite , the ratio of total transverse momentum to longitudinal kinetic energy or by requiring the velocity of the emitted particles to be about half of the center of mass velocity @xcite .",
    "obviously , each additional constraint reduces the number of events available for analysis .",
    "too many constraints may reduce the data to the extreme tails of the distributions where large fluctuations of the observable become a problem .    during the compression stage ,",
    "pressure in the central region causes the participant zone to expand @xcite .",
    "thus part of the available energy in central collision is converted to collective energy such as radial flow which expands outward , or transverse flow caused by the spectators being pushed by the participant region to the side , and the squeeze - out of nucleons from the participant region perpendicular to the reaction plane due to blocking by the spectators @xcite",
    ". clearly , all these collective motions strongly affect the signals of the phase - transition observed in central collisions and reduce the amount of excitation energy available for heating up the system .",
    "they must be understood and taken into account in the study of phase transition .",
    "theoretically , spectators should be less affected by the effects of collective motion than the participants .",
    "the collision kinematics focus the emitted fragments from the projectile to the forward direction in the laboratory .",
    "these fragments are generally detected with spectrometers or detectors placed at forward angles and the charges , velocities etc .",
    "are identified .",
    "the decay of a projectile spectator is easier to study experimentally than the target spectator which is emitted backward with very low energy in the laboratory frame .    unlike central collisions",
    ", the impact parameter is strongly correlated with the size of the source in peripheral collisions .",
    "thus the size of the projectile - like residue such as the charge , @xmath69 , provides some indication of the impact parameter @xcite . in the case where most of the projectiles fragment into many small pieces ,",
    "the quantity @xmath70 defined as the sum of atomic numbers @xmath71 of all fragments with @xmath72 has been found to be a good measure for impact parameter @xcite .",
    "it represents the charge of the spectator system reduced by the number of hydrogen isotopes emitted during its decay and thus , it is the complement of the hydrogen multiplicity , @xmath50 . in an experiment where both @xmath70 was measured by the forward spectrometer and @xmath49 was measured by a @xmath65 array in the reaction of au+au at e / a=400 mev , the two observables are anti - correlated @xcite .",
    "thus , like @xmath49 and other observables discussed in previous section , @xmath70 can be used in eq.(4.1 ) to provide a quantitative measure of the impact parameter .",
    "around incident energy of 50a mev , fragment multiplicities increase with the size of the emission source and excitation energy . in examining reactions of xe on various targets , @xmath73c , @xmath74al , @xmath75v , @xmath76cu , @xmath77y and @xmath67au ,",
    "even though the targets span a range of n / z from 1.0 to 1.5 , a near - universal correlation has been observed between the average number of emitted imfs , @xmath78 , and the charge - particle multiplicity , @xmath49 , for non- central collisions @xcite .",

    "large radial expansion velocities are required in addition to the three sources @xcite .",

    "0.2 in      the observation by the purdue group @xcite that the yields of the fragments produced in p+xe and p+kr obeyed a power law @xmath143 led to a conjecture that the fragmenting target was near the critical point of liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the origin of this conjecture is the fisher model @xcite which predicts that at the critical point the yields of droplets will be given by a power law .",

    "but the power law is no longer taken as the ` proof ' of criticality .",
    "there are many systems that exhibit this sort of power law : mass distributions of asteroids in the solar system , debris from the crushing of basalt pellets @xcite and the fragmentation of frozen potatoes @xcite .",
    "in fact , the lattice gas model which has been used a great deal for calculations of phase transitions and multifragmentation in nuclei @xcite gives a power law at the critical point , on the coexistence curve ( that is a first order phase transition provided the freeze - out density is less than the critical density ) and also along a line in the @xmath144 plane away from the coexistence curve .",
    "nonetheless , the occurrence of a power law is an experimental fact and it is therefore desirable that models which aim to describe multifragmentation produce a power law , phase transition or not .    even if we expect to see a phase transition in nuclear collisions it is unlikely that the system dissociates at the critical point .",

    "if the liquid - gas phase transition is of first order , one would expect to see enhanced specific heat @xmath36 corresponding to a plateau region in the caloric curve defined as temperature , @xmath34 vs. heat or excitation energy @xmath35 . aside from the experimental difficulties associated with measuring both quantities",
    "as discussed in sections 7 and 8 , the simple caloric curve of temperature vs. excitation energy with a plateau in the temperature assumes that the pressure is constant @xcite .",
    "there is no experimental evidence that such a condition is met in nuclear collisions .",
    "thus even without introducing the isospin degree of freedom , the caloric curves depend on three variables , pressure , volume and temperature .",
    "such complicated , three - dimensional nuclear caloric curves have been recently calculated @xcite .",
    "different shapes of the caloric curves have been obtained depending on the conditions of the experiments and analysis .",
    "therefore , one - dimensional caloric curves are useful only if the exact conditions can be determined or modeled . by themselves , these curves can be misleading and definitely do not constitute a signature for the liquid - gas phase transition even though the idea is very attractive .",
    "one of the purposes of this review article is to examine the experimental efforts in extracting the liquid - gas phase transition signals .",
    "since many caloric curves have been measured since 1995 , we will discuss the experimentally obtained curves keeping the above  warnings \" in mind .",
    "if the incident energy is assumed to be related to the excitation energy , ( this is particularly true for central collisions ) , then fig.11 , which is a plot of temperature versus incident energy from e / a=30 to 200 mev , is one form of caloric curve .",
    "it shows that the trend depends highly on the specific thermometers chosen to measure the temperature ; the kinetic temperature increases rapidly ( from 12 to 30 mev ) ; the excited states temperatures are nearly constant ( from 3 to 7 mev ) ; the isotope temperatures involving he isotopes increase moderately ( from 4 to 10 mev ) but isotope temperatures involving @xmath123c,@xmath73c stay nearly constant at 4 mev .",
    "fig.11 sums up the most serious experimental problems we are faced with i.e. the discrepancies in the temperature measurements .",
    "however , this figure also shows that the excitation functions of the temperature measurement exhibit a smooth behavior within each class of thermometer .",
    "moreover , the trends are consistent from experiment to experiment since the data shown in fig.11 come from many different sources .    0.2 in = 4.5 in    0.2 in    fig . 13 : summary of caloric curves measured .",
    "the curves in the right panel have been offset by 2 mev for each successive curve , starting with ar+ni .",
    "0.2 in    the more traditional caloric curves which plott temperatures versus the extracted excitation energy are shown in fig.13 . in the left hand panel ,",
    "all the curves are plotted on the same scale .",
    "the temperatures obtained have been extracted using the isotope yield ratios ; t@xmath124(he - li ) are denoted by circles and t@xmath124(he - dt ) are represented by the squares . to avoid confusions ,",
    "all the temperatures plotted are the experimental apparent temperatures since sequential decay corrections are highly model dependent .",
    "sequential decays account for part of the differences between t@xmath124(he - li ) and t@xmath124(he - dt ) and there are empirical correction factors to reduce such differences . however , in this plot , the differences between the curves constructed with t@xmath124(he - li ) or t@xmath124(he - dt ) are much larger than the correction factors .",
    "thus , to keep the discussion simple , only the reported raw data are shown .    in order to view each successive curve better , they are re - plotted in the right panel with a scale compressed by a factor of 2 . each curve is offset from from its predecessor by 2 mev and the corresponding reactions are labelled close to the curves .",
    "the most interesting curve is the one labeled ",

    "it was obtained from the spectator decays of the au+au reaction at e / a=600 mev @xcite .",
    "t@xmath124(he - li ) , remains relatively constant as a function of deduced excitation energy , e*/a , between 3 and 10 mev but increases rapidly at e*/a greater than 10 mev .",
    "the resemblance to the first order phase transition of liquid raises a lot of excitement in the field .",
    "it also resembles the prediction from the statistical model @xcite .    unlike the predicted caloric curves from realistic models which will be discussed in more details in section xii or the temperature excitation functions of figure 11 , the experimental caloric curves depend strongly on the reaction systems and analysis .",
    "( due to the effect of sequential decay , caloric curves determined from the experimentally extracted isotope yields may not resemble the curves of the deduced primary fragments @xcite . ) on the other hand , if one ignores the highest excitation data point in the au+au system , all caloric curves exhibit a smooth increase of temperature with excitation energy .",
    "this trend is very similar to the increase of t@xmath124(he - li ) as a function of incident energy as shown in fig.11 .",
    "however in that case , the excitation function of the t@xmath124(he - li ) is nearly independent of reaction systems , au+au , kr+nb and ar+sc reactions , measured by different experimental groups .",
    "the differences in the curves shown in figure 13 again point to the uncertainties associated with the experimental procedures in extracting temperature and excitation energy .",
    "all the caloric curves measured so far suffer from the same uncertainties in determining the excitation energy .",
    "some data may have better handle on the excitation energy because of better detector coverage or simpler reaction mechanisms .",
    "for example , the caloric curves obtained from the projectile fragmentation of au , la and kr on c , @xcite have been extracted with a time - projection chamber ( eos - tpc ) where a complete reconstruction of the projectile charge can be accomplished .",
    "the curves obtained from au+c and kr+c overlap very nicely with each other even though the la+c system shows lower temperatures measured .",

    "many of the extracted caloric curves do not agree with each other .",
    "part of the differences can be attributed to the energy thresholds applied to extract the isotope yields .",
    "the high energy thresholds used in the a@xmath1100 systems to isolate the prompt component @xcite probably account for the highest temperatures obtained in all the curves . for the au+c , la+c , kr+c , @xcite @xmath45he+au , and @xmath45he+ag @xcite systems ,",
    "assumptions have been made regarding the pre - equilibrium contributions and the missing neutrons .",
    "energy thresholds are used to eliminate pre - equilibrium emissions .",
    "this might account for the relatively high temperatures measured as compared to the temperatures extracted from au+au reaction . in the latter case",

    "calculations predict neutrons and protons to be inhomogenously distributed within the system resulting in a relatively neutron - rich gas and relatively neutron - poor liquid @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature may also be reduced with increasing neutron excess reflecting the fact that a pure neutron liquid probably does not exist @xcite . while , recent calculations suggest that the rather narrow range of isospin values available in the laboratory might not allow us to observe the decrease in critical temperature @xcite , efforts are underway to study the fractionation of the isospin in the co - existence region . as the isospin effects are not large , the influence of sequential decays becomes important and may obscure the isospin fractionation effect one wishes to study . to minimize such problems , isobar pairs , such as ( t,@xmath45he ) , which have the same number of internal excited states",

    "the eos of lgm in mean - field theory in a grand canonical ensemble is done in textbooks @xcite . to obtain clusters in the model an extension of the wellknown model",
    "is necessary .",

    "the latter has been extensively studied and indeed serves as a model for liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "many of the known results of the ising model can be directly applied .",

    "in this configuration each of the @xmath162 nucleons can be given a momentum by monte - carlo sampling of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution at the given temperature .",
    "thus in an event we have nucleons at definite lattice sites with definite momenta .",
    "there may be some isolated nucleons which have no nearest neighbours .",
    "these clearly are monomers .",
    "the next case is when there is a cluster of two nucleons which are nearest neighbours of each other .",

    "it turns out that this prescription which is rigorously correct for a cluster of two also works _ statistically _ for larger clusters .",
    "that is , we can formulate a rule that independent of other neighbours , two nearest neighbours form part of the same cluster if the relative kinetic energy of the two is insufficient to overcome their attraction .",
    "it is obvious that this recipe , introduced in @xcite , reduces the many body problem of recognising a cluster of many nucleons into a sum of independent two body problems . for brevity",
    "we refer to this as pd recipe . to see why this works _ statistically",
    "_ even if not individually let us specifically consider a three body cluster @xcite .    for three particle clusters , nearest neighbours are either linear or l shaped . in either case",
    "there is only one particle which has two bonds ( label this by particle 2 ) and two others ( label them 1 and 3 ) which have one bond each . according to the pd recipe",
    "this will form a three body cluster if @xmath306 and @xmath307 . to check if particle 3 is part of a three body cluster ( similar arguments will be needed for particles 1 and 2 ) we should instead verify if @xmath308 . here",
    "@xmath309 is the relative momentum between the centre of mass of ( 1 + 2 ) and 3 ; @xmath310 is the reduced mass for this relative motion .",
    "thus there may be cases where the pd recipe gives a three body cluster wheras in reality the third one will separate .",
    "but there will also be cases where the pd recipe will deem that the third one will separate whereas in reality it stays attached .",
    "statistically overestimation will cancel out underestimation because for a maxwell - boltzmann distribution all relative motions are also maxwellian at the same temperature .",
    "that is , in monte - carlo simulation , @xmath311 will be as many times below the value @xmath312 as @xmath313 will be .",

    "it can be verified that if @xmath314 and @xmath307 then @xmath315 is always satisfied .",
    "campi and krivine have used a different approach and come to the conclusion @xcite that the pd recipe gives the correct number of particle stable clusters .",
    "recognition of clusters in a many body system is a complicated issue .",

    "once the configuration of @xmath162 nucleons and their momenta are given , the cluster decomposition is immediate .",
    "one may however , starting from this initial condition , switch to a different model .",
    "one may propagate particles using molecular dynamics . at asymptotic times clusters",
    "are easily identified as different clusters will separate from each other .",
    "of course the result will depend upon the interaction potential used for molecular dynamics propagation .",
    "to test the pd recipe one must use an interaction consistent with the assumptions of the lattice gas model .",
    "let @xmath11 be the length of each side of the elementary cubic lattice .",
    "the interaction between particles must become repulsive when the distance between them gets to be less than @xmath11 . at distance",

    "given the same initialisation and such interaction , molecular dynamics produced very similar results as the pd recipe .",

    "the binding energies of these nuclei thus computed were then fitted to a simple liquid - drop mass formula : @xmath328 here @xmath329 is the neutron - proton asymmetry of the nucleus .",
    "the fit of lgm binding energies to this four parameter formula is quite good .",
    "we compare the four parameters deduced from lgm to liquid - drop model values @xcite in the table . considering the simplicity of the model , the agreement is gratifying .",
    "we also notice that the asymmetry parameter @xmath228 is larger than the liquid - drop value .",
    "since @xmath330 is fixed from nuclear matter binding energy , the only way we can bring down @xmath228 is to make @xmath325 and @xmath326 go negative . as explained",

    "we mentioned earlier that the isotopic content of the gas phase can be different from that of the liquid phase .",
    "this comes out nicely in lgm .",
    "fig.26 , taken from @xcite demonstrates this .",
    "here one considers breakup of @xmath67au at different temperatures .",
    "the average value of the charge of the largest residue at each temperature is denoted by @xmath335 .",
    "this will drop in value as the temperature is increased .",
    "also calculated is the average value of neutron content @xmath336 of the largest cluster .",
    "we may regard the largest cluster as the liquid phase and the rest of the nucleons as primarily belonging to the gas phase .",
    "the disintegrating system has @xmath337 . with an isospin dependent lgm",
    ", the @xmath338 is much closer to 1 .",
    "this means the gas phase has a higher @xmath339 ratio , higher than that of the parent system .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the symmetry energy drives the @xmath339 ratio of the largest cluster towards the value unity .",
    "the coulomb effect will offset this as shown in the figure .",
    "the simplest version of the lgm which had no isospin dependence and no coulomb term will keep the @xmath338 at the value pertaining to the disintegrating system .",
    "this is also shown in the figure .",
    "this contradicts experiment .    0.2 in = 3.0 in = 3.0 in    0.2 in    fig.26 the ratio @xmath338 as @xmath335 changes ( because temperature changes ) .",

    "the model has been used successfully to obtain several experimental results , for example , @xmath343 ratios as the isotopic content of the parent system changes @xcite .",
    "some applications were made in @xcite .",
    "the shortcomings of the model for detailed fittings to experimental data are obvious .",
    "the model has cubical symmetry rather than spherical symmetry .",
    "the shell effects are missing although the smooth part of binding energy is approximately reproduced .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the composites is incorrect .",
    "but it has many nice features not present in other models . here",
    "composites are formed directly out of fluctuations .",
    "one starts with interactions between two nucleons .",
    "the inclusion of coulomb effects is precise , though numerical .",
    "best of all , it includes interactions between composites .",
    "a phenomenological droplet model based on homogeneous nucleation theory has also been used to describe mass yields provided in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the nucleation model is an extension of the fisher droplet model which was originally used to describe such yields .",
    "the extension allows for the possibility that supersaturated systems are produced during the brief encounter of two colliding nuclei .",
    "homogeneous nucleation occurs in supersaturated systems when chance collisions of particles in the gas phase yield to local density inhomogeneties .",
    "these inhomogenities are droplets of particles of the liquid phase that will grow in size if the systems lived for a long time .",
    "specifically , in the supersaturated phase , a critical size droplet exists which is determined by the surface tension and the difference of liquid and gas chemical potentials .",
    "droplets larger than the critical size will grow by accumulating nucleons in order to lower the free energy of the system while droplets of smaller size will evaporate nucleons also lowering the free energy of the system .",
    "this behaviour in growth and evaporation reflects itself in a yield distribution which is u - shaped with an initial decrease with @xmath162 until the critical size @xmath344 is reached and then an increase in yield with @xmath162 above @xmath344 . in this nucleation description , the probability of formation of droplets is determined by calculating the change in gibbs free energy with and without a drop at constant temperature and pressure .",
    "for example , if a droplet of size @xmath162 is surrounded by @xmath120 droplets of the gas phase , then @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "here @xmath347 and @xmath348 are the liquid and gas chemical potentials , @xmath40 is the radius of the drop ( with @xmath349 ) and @xmath188 is the surface free energy such that @xmath350 mev at @xmath34=0 .",
    "the @xmath351 term is a term introduced by fisher to account for the power law fall - off of yield distributions at a critical point with @xmath92 a critical exponent .",
    "the probability of forming a drop of @xmath162 nucleons is @xmath352 where @xmath353 .",
    "this gives a cluster distribution @xmath354 , to a constant @xmath355 , @xmath356\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the coexistence curve of a liquid - gas phase transition @xmath357 and @xmath354 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath162 .",
    "for a supersaturated system @xmath358 and @xmath354 has a minimum value at a critical size droplet @xmath344 . neglecting the @xmath359 term , @xmath344 is given by @xmath360 .",
    "the model fits yields of many heavy - ion collisions .",
    "early studies of the liquid - gas phase transition were carried out using a skyrme interaction and focussed mostly on a one component system made of nucleons even though expressions were developed for two component system of protons and neutrons @xcite .",
    "the one component aspects are given in section ii of this review .",
    "the two component aspects will now be discussed in a mean - field approach with this section based mostly on the work of muller and serot @xcite .",
    "extensions of the results of @xcite are now being carried out in @xcite using a skyrme interaction while the muller - serot analysis is based on a relativistic mean - field model .",
    "initial results in @xcite are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite .",
    "both approaches allow a complete calculation various thermodynamic properties , such as the pressure and proton and neutron chemical potentials . in one component systems , the skyrme interaction and the relativistic mean - field model lead to an s - shaped behaviour of pressure versus volume or density at fixed temperature with stable , unstable , supersaturated and supercooled regions .",
    "the standard maxwell construction describes the liquid to gas phase transition with both phases having the same pressure @xmath361 , and the chemical potential @xmath362 .",
    "the equality of chemical potentials of the liquid and gas phases in phase equilibrium is equivalent to equal areas of the regions above and below the maxwell or vapour pressure line in the s - shaped loop in @xmath278 vs. @xmath166 . for two component systems ,",
    "phase equilibrium becomes more complicated since the proton to neutron ratio can be different in the two phases because of the symmetry energy which favours @xmath363 .",
    "since the symmetry energy will be large in the denser liquid phase , the proton - neutron asymmetry will be bigger in the gas phase than in the liquid phase . in two component systems ,",
    "the phase equilibrium conditions consist of setting , at fixed pressure , the proton chemical potentials in the two phases equal to each other and similarly , the neutron chemical potentials are equal in the liquid and gas phases .",
    "the properties of the phase separation boundaries ( binodals ) and instability boundaries ( spinodals ) are studied as a function of a quantity labelled @xmath364 which is the proton fraction , with the neutron fraction given as @xmath365 , and @xmath366 . for two component systems ,",
    "the binodals are now a surface in plots in ( @xmath367 ) space .",
    "by contrast , for one component systems , the binodal is a line for the vapour or maxwell pressure vs. @xmath34 which terminates at the critical temperature @xmath368 .",
    "the line is at @xmath369 in the ( @xmath367 ) space of two component systems .",
    "the two dimensional binodal surface of the phase coexistence boundary now contains a line of critical points for different values of @xmath370 and a line of maximal asymmetry . in a @xmath371 plot of the binodal surface ,",
    "the intersection of a fixed @xmath34 plane with the surface gives a loop of @xmath278 vs. @xmath370 .",
    "the maximal asymmetry point is at @xmath372 and physically corresponds to the smallest proton ratio or the largest neutron ratio on the binodal surface at each @xmath34 .",
    "the critical point is at @xmath373 on this loop .",
    "the loop degenerates to a point at the critical temperature of a symmetric system @xmath369 ( see fig . 7 in @xcite ) . if @xmath34 and @xmath278 are both fixed , the binodal surface has two values of @xmath370 : @xmath374 and @xmath375 corresponding to different values of the proton fraction in the liquid and gas phase .",
    "these different values arise because of the difference in symmetry energy in the liquid and the gas phase .",
    "one of the interesting conclusions of the mean - field two component model of the liquid - gas phase transition is that the first - order transition of a one component system becomes a second - order transition . because of the greater dimensionality in the physical situation , the phase transition is continuous .",
    "the role of dimensionality due to the number of components of the system on the order of the phase transition was also pointed out by glendenning @xcite .",
    "the one common characteristic of all the theoretical models considered so far is that they are static , i.e. , they all assume that equilibrium is achieved and hence laws of eqiulibrium statistical mechanics apply .",
    "a more fundamental calculation would use a transport equation . here",
    "two nuclei approach each other in their ground state . by solving a time dependent equation we see what the final outcomes are .",
    "the buu model does start with two nuclei , in their ground states , boosted towards each other .",
    "one does not have to introduce a temperature .",
    "the model has a mean - field as well as hard collisions and has indeed proven to be highly successful in predicting sideward flow , squeeze - out etc .",
    "while buu is good for predicting expectation values of one - body operators , it does not have fluctuations .",
    "thus it will not produce clusters .",
    "a great deal of effort went into introducing fluctuations in buu type formalism .",
    "a very short list of references are @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , practical calculations are extremely time consuming . in rare cases calculations",
    "have been done to compare with experimental data@xcite but the method has not been pushed to see , for example , the rise and fall of imf production , an accurate estimation of the @xmath92 parameter etc .",
    "maybe , in future such calculations will be done .    while exact calculations for heavy - ion collisions based on quantum mechanics are impossible to carry out , classical calculations for ion - on - ion collisions for @xmath1400 particles are entirely feasible with present day computers .",
    "this requires solving for each particle @xmath376 and @xmath377 . here",
    "@xmath378 is the two body interaction .",
    "one starts at time @xmath379 with initial values of @xmath380 and numerically integrates out time . in a set of three papers @xcite pandharipande and coworkers studied disassembly of hot classical drops as well as collisions between cold charged argon balls containing @xmath381 and @xmath382 particles .",
    "the chosen values of @xmath383 were ( 108,108 ) , ( 200,16 ) and ( 65,65 ) @xcite .",
    "the interaction between atoms was a truncated ( 12,6 ) potential and a coulomb interaction was added .",
    "although this is thirteen years later , the reader will find reference @xcite still very relevant and revealing . as a function of time , the evolution of temperature and density of the central region",
    "is plotted so that one can see under what initial conditions the central region reaches spinodal instability and what the final products are in such cases .",
    "they point out that the mass yields calculated in the disassembly of hot equilibrated drops having 216 particles and density somewhat less than normal density is very similar to mass yield of 108 + 108 collisions .",
    "thus the assumption of statistical equilibrium is valid .",
    "the authors stress that the classical argon balls used in the study are not intended to be mock nuclei , but instead to provide simple systems whose time evolution can be studied exactly by solving newton s equations of motion .",
    "direct comparisons with nuclear data are difficult .",
    "nonetheless , there are many similarities . a power law for fragment yields followed from these calculations , the minimum value being about 1.7 .",
    "another remarkable feature is that the apparent temperature deduced from the fragment kinetic energies is much larger than that of the system .",
    "the large kinetic energies of fragments in the simulation appear to come from collective motion of expansion and coulomb repulsion .    in a later paper ,",
    "the illinois group devised a simple nucleon - nucleon potential for classical calculations of nuclear heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "they did not use this potential to study liquid - gas phase transition but instead used this at bevalac energies to investigate flow angles and transverse momenta .",
    "later , disassembly of a collection of nucleons which start with initial temperature and density of interest in this article , and interact via this potential was considered by other groups @xcite .",
    "pratt et al .",
    "@xcite used a truncated ( 8,4 ) potential to study similar dissociation .",
    "it has not been demonstrated that such simulations apply to nuclear cases very well since actual nuclear data for specific cases have not been compared .",
    "the frankfurt group proposed a simulation which they called quantum molecular dynamics(qmd ) .",
    "this was used for bevalac energies initially .",
    "relativistic versions exist and are in frequent use .",
    "this has also been used for energy region of interest here .",
    "detailed exposition of the model exists @xcite . here",
    "each nucleon is represented by a gaussian in coordinate and momentum space with widths consistent with uncertainty principle .",
    "the centroids of the gaussians move but the widths are kept fixed .",
    "the centroids move under the influence of mean - field except when the centroids move very close to each other ( @xmath384 )",
    ". then they scatter as in two - body scattering .",
    "pauli blocking is taken into account for scattering . because each particle is represented by a centroid in phase space with fixed widths in momentum and coorinate space",
    ", there is fluctuation built into the system and in the final stage one can recognise clusters . in calculations reported in reference",
    "@xcite fragment multiplicities were underpredicted in the energy region of interest here .",
    "the copenhagen group has done simulations using a prescription which they dubbed nuclear molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "this is quite similar to qmd .",
    "all such simulations which provide clusters at the end are quite computer intensive .. the clusters are easily recognised if each event is run until `` asymptotic '' times so that different clusters are well separated from each other .",
    "but that requires considerable computer time .",
    "quite sophisticated algorithms have been introduced for early recognition of clusters @xcite .",
    "this is of practical importance .",
    "many other models are on the market which will simulate ion - on - ion collisions .",
    "they were not necessarily introduced to study liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "some references are @xcite .",
    "phase transition aspects were discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "a very attractive model , expanding emitting source ( ees ) model was proposed by friedman @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that initially the hot system evaporates as well as expands .",
    "for low initial temperature the system will cease expanding and will revert towards normal density .",
    "but beyond a certain temperature at the end of this slow expansion the system will explode .",
    "the relationship of this model to liquid - gas phase transition will be interesting to explore .",
    "the possible links of many experimental observables to expected liquid - gas phase transition in finite nuclear systems continue to be a fascinating story .",
    "much has been learnt and much remains to be learnt .",
    "the topic has forced nuclear physicists to delve into realms that were not familiar to them .",
    "necessity has prompted us to do interesting theoretical work , for example , @xcite in finite - size scaling and in general , about phase transitions in `` small '' systems @xcite .",
    "we are exploring ideas which are of relevance in other fields .",
    "there is a broadening of the horizon which is refreshing .",
    "we foresee substantial effort in several directions , for example , in dynamical models .",
    "just fifteen years ago , multifragmentation was barely mentioned in the literature . however , in the past decade tremendous progress has been made in understanding the multifragmentation process and its relationship to the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter . even though we have not found one definitive experimental signature pinpointing the phenomenon , we know that a mixed phase can be created in the heavy - ion reactions , that multifragmentation occurs within 50 - 200 fm / c after the initial collisions with a freeze - out density of less than 1/3 of the normal nuclear density , and that the freeze - out temperature is probably in the range of 4 - 6 mev . in the near future , experiments will be designed to measure excitation energy , reaction time and freeze - out densities and other observables more precisely .",
    "nonetheless , the availability of comprehensive experimental data has stimulated intense interest on the theoretical front leading to better understanding of the statistical and dynamical nature of nuclear collisions .",
    "more exciting developments will be awaiting in the exploration of the isospin degree of freedom in the liquid - gas phase transition with the availability of high to moderate intensity radioactive beams .    in writing",
    "this article we have also realised that a vast amount of work has been done in this field by groups widely spread geographically .",
    "the literature on this subject is colossal .",
    "our reporting had to be necessarily selective , influenced largely by our own involvement and experience .",
    "we are particularly aware that in writing an article about a subject whose scope is this large we must have left out a significant amount of interesting work .",
    "for example , several review articles can be written on the subject matter of the last section alone .",
    "we finish therefore by apologising for all the omissions that occurred .",
