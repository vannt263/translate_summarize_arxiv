    "since graphene has been discovered  @xcite , many properties of this two - dimensional material have been studied both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite . in a recent experimental research",
    "the dynamic of light atoms deposited on a single - layer garphene has been studied by the mean of transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) technic  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional structure of graphene suggests the possibility of motion with just two degrees of freedom . the free energy surface for a particle moving above a graphene sheet explains different motion - related phenomena at nanoscale as well as the various directed motions on the carbon nanotube - based motors  @xcite .",
    "a net motion can be obtained from a nanoscale system subjected to a thermal gradient  @xcite . recently the motion of an experimentally designed nanoscale motor consisting of a capsule - like carbon nanotube inside a host carbon nanotube has been explained successfully with molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "the capsule travels back and forth between both ends of the host carbon nanotube along the axial direction .",
    "_ have designed an artificial nanofabricated motor in which one short carbon nanotube travels relative to another coaxial carbon nanotube  @xcite .",
    "this motion is actuated by a thermal gradient as high as 1knm@xmath1 applied to the ends of the coaxial carbon nanotubes .",
    "since graphene has a very high thermal conductivity ( 3000 - 5000wk@xmath1m@xmath1  @xcite ) , as high as diamond and carbon nanotubes  @xcite , it is a good candidate for heat transferring designs in nano - electromechanical systems .",
    "because of strong covalent bonds in graphene , thermal lattice conduction dominates the electrons contribution  @xcite . recently yang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the thermal conductivity and thermal rectification of trapezoidal and rectangular graphene nanoribbons and found a significant thermal rectification effect in asymmetric graphene ribbons  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the motion of a nanoscale object , e.g. @xmath0 , on a graphene sheet , in the presence of a temperature gradient .",
    "we show that the graphene is a good two - dimensional substrate for thermal actuation due to its high thermal conductivity , however as it is expected , in the absence of a thermal gradient , the @xmath0 molecule randomly diffuses on the graphene sheet  @xcite . the average velocity along the temperature gradient direction and the free energy change throughout the system are calculated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    "we will introduce the atomistic model and the simulation method .",
    "sec .  3 contains the main results including those for the produced temperature gradient , the trajectory of the @xmath0 molecule over the graphene sheet and the free energy change .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are included in sec .",
    "the system was composed of a graphene sheet as a substrate , with dimensions @xmath25nm@xmath3 and a @xmath0 molecule above the sheet .",
    "the graphene sheet with @xmath4 carbon atoms was divided into 12 equal rectangular segments .",
    "each segment with @xmath5 carbon atoms was arranged in 40 atomic rows ( along armchair or @xmath6-direction ) .",
    "each row has 30 atoms which were arranged along zigzag direction .",
    "the system was equilibrated for 300ps at @xmath7k before the temperature gradient was applied .",
    "once the system was equilibrated , the first ( hot spot ) and last ( cold end ) segments of the graphene sheet were kept at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "a temperature gradient between the two ends was then produced , i.e. @xmath10  ( top panel of fig .  [ figmode ] ) . to make the model more efficient and prevent crumpling ( see fig .",
    "[ figcrump](a ) ) of the ends , we fixed the @xmath11-components of the first atomic row in the first segment and the last row of the last segment ( see fig .",
    "[ figcrump](b ) ) .",
    "bottom : produced four temperature gradients after 450  ps of a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "delta symbols are related to @xmath12  =  100 k , and for square symbols @xmath12  =  80 k , circle symbols @xmath13  =  60 k and for gradient symbols @xmath12  =  40 k , respectively .",

    "the black dots show a typical trajectory of the motion of a c@xmath14 molecule over the graphene sheet from the hot spot toward the cold spot . ]",
    "we carried out md simulations employing two types of the interatomic potentials : 1 ) the covalent bonds between the carbon atoms in the graphene sheet and in the @xmath0 molecule are described by brenner potential  @xcite and 2 ) the non - bonded van der waals interactions between the graphene atoms and those of the @xmath0 molecule .",
    "brenner potential has been parameterized to model @xmath15 covalent bonds in the graphene , carbon nanotube and @xmath0 structures . for the non - bonded potential",
    "a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential gives reasonable results  @xcite .",
    "here we choose the lj parameters as @xmath16mev and @xmath17  @xcite which represent the depth and range of the lj potential energy , respectively .",
    "note that the lj potential is a simple and commonly used potential for modeling the interaction between carbon nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using a velocity - verlet algorithm with a time step @xmath18fs .",
    "the temperature of the hot end ( @xmath8 ) and the cold end ( @xmath9 ) were held constant by a nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "the temperature of the inner segments were not controlled by the thermostat .",
    "periodic boundary condition was applied only in the @xmath19-direction . due to the applied temperature gradient",
    ", the system can no longer be described by equilibrium methods and we shall thus employ nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "a temperature gradient were produced across the system during 450ps and a stationary state was established .",
    "the @xmath0 molecule was put above the second segment at @xmath20  ( here index @xmath21 refer to the center of mass ) .  during",
    "the production runs of 750ps both the @xmath6 and @xmath19 positions of the center of mass of the @xmath0 molecule were recorded .",
    "moreover the temperature of each segment was calculated by measuring the total kinetic energy of that segment . in our simulations",
    "a typical value for the relative standard deviation of the total energy of the extended system is about @xmath22 .",
    "a full simulation run takes about 50h cpu time on a 3.2ghz pentium iv processor with 4 gb ram .    in order to compute the change in the free energy",
    ", one can employ the commonly used thermodynamic integration and perturbation methods  @xcite .",
    "a good estimation for the absolute value of the free energy requires sampling the whole phase space which is not feasible .",
    "jarzynski s method removes this difficulty for nonequilibrium simulations  @xcite .",
    "there is an equality between the change of the free energy @xmath23 and the work @xmath24 applied on the system ( here the @xmath0 molecule )  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the temperature in each segment ) , and the average is taken over different configurations with different initial conditions .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ jeq ] ) connects the change of the free energy ( between two equilibrium state ) and the applied work on the system in a nonequilibrium process .",
    "-component of the center of mass of c@xmath14 molecule over the graphene .",
    "the inset shows the velocity autocorrelation function for the @xmath19-component of the motion as a function of time .",
    "[ figmsd ] ]",
    "the temperature profiles for different temperature gradients with @xmath28k are shown in fig .",
    "[ figmode ] ( bottom panel ) . in this figure ,",
    "the local temperatures of each segment which were obtained by averaging over 500 data are indicated by symbols .",
    "corresponding error bars indicate the statistical errors and are in the range 4 - 6k .",
    "notice that the temperature profiles are nonlinear which is a commonly observed behavior in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation of thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the strong phonon scattering caused by the heat source or heat sink and can be explained by partly diffusive and partly ballistic energy transport along the system  @xcite .",
    "also , ripples in the graphene ( fig .",
    "[ figcrump](b ) ) are the other important source for phonon scattering  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these mechanisms cause a non - linear temperature profile in the middle segments .",
    "molecules and ( b ) the change of free energy during c@xmath14 motion from the hot end to the cold end .",

    "c@xmath14 attempts to find its equilibrium state and looks for the local minimum of the free energy .",
    "in other words , in the presence of a temperature gradient , the phonon waves created in the hot spot travel through the system , interact and transfer momentum to the c@xmath14 molecule which results a net motion  @xcite .",
    "the time series for the @xmath6 and @xmath19 coordinates , separately , are shown in figs .",
    "[ figxt](a , b ) .",
    "the trajectories of the six c@xmath14 molecules ( from the six different simulations ) in @xmath29 plane over a time interval of 750ps are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figxt](c ) . in all three cases",
    "the thick curve is the average of the six others .",
    "the motion along the @xmath6-direction is almost a linear uniform motion with velocities @xmath30 and 63 m/s for @xmath31k respectively ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ figxt](a ) ) .",
    "there are two computational methods that can be used to show that the motion along the @xmath19-direction is diffusive ( fig .",
    "[ figxt](c ) ) .",
    "first , one can use the einstein relation to find the diffusion constant @xmath32 by measuring the slope of the mean square displacement ( msd ) of the @xmath19-components of the position , i.e.  @xmath33 . to show that the motion along the @xmath19-direction is driftless , we look at the msd of @xmath19-component of the position of the c@xmath14 molecule . for a driftless motion",
    "the msd should grows linearly with time , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "we depict the msd in fig .",
    "[ figmsd ] for a long time simulation . as we see from this figure",
    "the slope of the msd is almost one ( after equilibration ) which is a signature of diffusive regime .",
    "alternatively one can use the green - kubo relation which makes use of the velocity autocovariance function ( vacf ) .",
    "more specifically , one can take the integral over the autocovariance of the @xmath19-components of the position of the velocity of c@xmath14 as @xmath35 , which gives the diffusion constant of random walk motion along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ figmsd ] shows the vacf versus time .",
    "we have tested both methods in order to compute @xmath32 .",
    "the result * * f**or the diffusion constant is about @xmath36m@xmath3/s .",
    "the directed motion resulted from the temperature gradient along the graphene sheet , provides a nanoscale motor for the material transferring .",
    "notice that in the absence of temperature gradient , when the system is equilibrated at @xmath27 =  300k , we found a diffusive motion on the graphene sheet  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ figwork](a , b ) show the variation of the total work and the changes in the free energy with time , respectively .",
    "the c@xmath14 loses on average almost 12ev of free energy after 750ps during the motion towards the cooler region .",
    "note that here , the condition @xmath37 is always satisfied which is a well known criterion for a nonequilibrium ( irreversible ) thermodynamics evolution  @xcite .",
    "this method for calculating the change of the free energy is a well known method in computational soft condensed matter  @xcite but it turns out to be useful also for studying various physical properties of graphene , particularly investigating the stability of new designs for nanoscale molecular devices as studied here .",
    "in summary , c@xmath14 moves directly toward the cold end of the graphene sheet when a temperature gradient is applied along armchair direction . it is found that the lateral motion ( along zigzag direction ) is a diffusive motion .",
    "the reduction of the free energy of the system along the molecule motion is an indicative of the drifted motion . comparing the free energy difference with the work performed on c@xmath14 shows that the process is indeed thermodynamically irreversible .",
    "the proposed mechanism for driving nanoparticles on a graphene sheet may be used in the design of novel nanoscale motors .",
