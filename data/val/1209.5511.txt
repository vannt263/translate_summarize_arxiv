    "promises new solutions for many applications in the biomedical and industrial fields .",
    "this new paradigm utilizes various methods to communicate information between nano - scale machines @xcite .",
    "a promising communication method at this scale , is _",
    "molecular communication_. different molecular communication schemes have been proposed that can be categorized based on their effective range of communication , namely short , medium or large @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on a diffusion based communication system for short and medium range nanonetworks . in this system",
    ", molecule concentration represents information .",
    "the transmitter emits molecules whose type and intensity depend on the current input symbol .",
    "these molecules propagate through the environment , with a portion hitting the receiver s surface .",
    "receptors located on receiver s surface form chemical bonds with the incoming molecules , initiating a process that eventually results in decoding of the transmitted information .",
    "different channel models for molecular communication have been developed and their related channel capacities have been evaluated in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite have proposed two modulation methods called concentration shift keying ( csk ) and molecular shift keying ( mosk ) . in these schemes ,",
    "information is encoded in molecule diffusion rate and molecule type , respectively .",
    "both csk and mosk suffer from interference caused by molecules from previous transmissions , hitting the receiver after a long delay .",
    "to control this interference in csk ( where only one molecule type is used ) , the decoding of the current symbol is adapted to the last decoded symbol .",
    "although this helps to manage the interference , it results in an error leakage to the current symbol if the last symbol is decoded incorrectly . using multiple molecule types , mosk is more resistant to interference than csk but it requires complex molecular mechanisms at both the transmitter and the receiver for message synthesis and decoding @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new modulation method based on the idea of using distinct types of molecules for consecutive slots at the transmitter , thus effectively suppressing the interference .",
    "although simple in its formulation , the method outperforms the existing ones . to evaluate the schemes , we propose a new system model for the molecule propagation process and the channel based on the poisson distribution .",
    "this model is more realistic and amenable to analysis than the one proposed in @xcite based on the binomial distribution .",
    "we evaluate and formulate the probability of error for our proposed scheme as well as the previous ones and compare the results . specially , we take into account the dependency of decoding of the current symbol to the last transmitted and decoded symbols to compute these metrics .",
    "numerical results indicate our scheme has a lower probability of error compared to csk and mosk . to understand the efficiency of our proposed scheme , we use information theoretic tools to derive a fundamental limit on the minimum probability of error of an arbitrary scheme .",
    "a comparison indicates that although our scheme outperforms the existing ones , its error exponent ( in terms of transmission power ) is larger than our fundamental lower bound , suggesting room for further improvement .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "proposed modulation scheme and system model are described in section ii . in section iii performance of different modulation techniques are discussed .",
    "also in this section a more general molecular communication system is introduced for which a lower bound on probability of error is computed .",
    "lastly numerical results are presented in section iv .",
    "the concentration shift keying ( csk ) scheme is inspired by the amplitude shift keying ( ask ) used in the classical communication . in this scheme ,",
    "symbols are encoded in the number of molecules that the transmitter diffuses ; this is called _ diffusion rate _ or _",
    "transmission power_. for example , to represent @xmath0 bits , @xmath1 different molecule diffusion rates are utilized . at the receiver ,",
    "the concentration ( number of the received molecules ) is compared with decision thresholds in order to decode the transmitted symbol .",
    "the molecules from the previous symbol in the last time slot may hit the receiver in the current time slot .",
    "thus , to reduce the effect of the interference in this method , decision thresholds for the current symbol need to be adapted to the last decoded symbol .",
    "molecular shift keying ( mosk ) scheme resembles the orthogonal modulation in the classical communications . to transmit @xmath0 bits per time slot ,",
    "@xmath1 different types of molecule are utilized .",
    "the transmitter releases a specified number of molecules of the type corresponding to the current input symbol . to decode the transmitted signal at a certain time slot",
    ", the receiver looks for a unique molecule type whose concentration exceeds a certain threshold @xmath2 .",
    "an error occurs if the concentration of none of the molecule types or more than one molecule type exceeds @xmath2 .",
    "although interference due to the previous transmission in mosk is less than that in the csk , but it still exists . also using different molecule types complicates the hardware structure at both the transmitter and the receiver as the number of molecule types increases exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "the performance of both the mosk and csk schemes is degraded by the interference caused by molecules of previous transmissions .",
    "in addition csk suffers from propagation of errors since the thresholds for each time slot is adapted to the previously decoded symbols .",
    "therefore , if the previous symbol is falsely decoded , its error leaks to the current symbol .",
    "our scheme borrows ideas from csk and mosk . having molecules of types @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the transmitter uses type @xmath3 in odd time slots , and type @xmath4 in even time slots .",
    "the use of two molecule types resembles mosk but the difference is that the molecule type is not used for signalling . to convey information in each time slot ,",
    "different diffusion rates are used ( similar to csk ) .",
    "thus , to match each symbol to @xmath0 bits , @xmath1 different propagation rates are utilized in each time slot . as the molecule types are different in two subsequent time slots , ( i ) the previous symbol interference has almost disappeared ( ii ) the decision threshold of the current symbol is independent of the last decoded symbol . since the data is not encoded in the molecule types ( but in the concentrations )",
    ", the number of molecule types ( and as a result the complexity ) , does not increase with @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to this scheme as molecular - concentration shift keying ( mocsk ) .",
    "in this section we develop a model for a general molecular transmission .",
    "later we use this model to compare probabilities of error of mosk , csk and mocsk .",
    "it is assumed that the symbols are transmitted in equal time slots called symbol duration , @xmath5 .",
    "generally the signal is decoded based on the concentration of molecule types received during a time slot .",
    "we assume that in a time slot three sources contribute to the received molecules of a specific type : ( i ) molecules due to transmission in the current time slot ( ii ) the residue molecules due to transmission in the last time slot ( the residue molecules from two or more earlier time slots are ignored ) ( iii ) the molecules from other sources as the noise of environment .",
    "more precisely , each molecule either misses hitting the receiver , or hits the receiver in the current or next time slot .",
    "let the hitting probabilities in the current and next time slot be @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we assume intra - molecule collisions have little effect on the molecule s movement .    for each molecule type",
    ", the transmitter has a storage .",
    "every storage has an outlet whose size controls how many molecules can exit the storage to be diffused in the environment .",
    "the distribution of the number of molecules that exit from the storage in a time slot is poisson .",
    "this follows from the fact that the number of molecules in the storage is large and probability of each passing through the outlet is small .",
    "we use @xmath9 to denote the number of molecules exiting the storage ( and diffused in the environment ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is called the diffusion rate and is determined by the size of the opening of the outlet .",
    "parameter @xmath10 itself is a random variable that is decided by the transmitter based on the message it wishes to transmit .",
    "assume that the transmitter has chosen diffusion rates of @xmath11 and @xmath12 of a molecule type like @xmath13 in two consecutive time slots in a modulation scheme . also , consider the environmet noise independent of the source signal as a poisson noise with parameter @xmath14 .",
    "considering hitting probabilities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and using the thinning property of poisson and the fact that sum of independent poisson rv s is itself a poission , the number of type @xmath13 molecules received within the current time slot ( denoted by @xmath15 ) follows a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "this poisson model has advantages over the binomial model considered in @xcite : ( i ) the poisson model is more realistic and practical in comparison with the binomial model .",
    "for instance , in binomial model the transmitter needs to count the number of molecules that it diffuses in comparison with the poisson model in which the size of the storage s outlet is controlled ( without counting the exact number of molecule passing through the outlet ) .",
    "( ii ) the poisson model is easier to work with analytically because of the nice properties of poisson ( e.g. thinning property , etc . ) .      in the csk method , only one type of molecule for instance @xmath13 is used in all time slots .",
    "so , the decoding is made by comparing the number of received molecules , i.e. @xmath15 , with the thresholds determined based on the last decoded symbol .    in mosk , as information is encoded in molecule type , if two subsequent symbols are the same , only one molecule type for instance @xmath3 is received , otherwise two molecule types for instance @xmath3 from the current symbol and @xmath4 type from the previous symbol are received . in the former case ,",
    "the symbol is decoded correctly if the total sum of received molecules , i.e. @xmath18 , exceeds the threshold @xmath2 . in the latter",
    ", decision is made based on @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the threshold @xmath2 .    in the proposed mocsk scheme , as stated above , 2 different types of molecules in 2 subsequent time slots are used .",
    "as the receiver knows the type of the current symbol , it needs only to compare the number of the molecules of this type with the thresholds to decode the current symbol .",
    "we now compute the average probability of error for csk , mosk and mocsk .    as in @xcite",
    ", we only consider the class of simple symbol - by - symbol decoders that are practically appealing .",
    "comparisons are made consistently for decoders in this class with the same transmission powers .",
    "for binary csk ( bcsk ) using molecules of type @xmath13 , if the current input symbol is @xmath20 and the last transmitted and decoded symbols are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , the probability of successful decoding is computed as@xmath23where @xmath24 is the decoded current symbol and @xmath25 is the decision threshold corresponding to the value of @xmath22 .",
    "note that in this equation , @xmath22 is not necessarily equal to the previous transmitted symbol , i.e. @xmath21 . in fact , the decision threshold for the current symbol is determined based on the previous decoded symbol regardless of being decoded correctly or not",
    ".    for binary mosk ( bmosk ) , assume molecules type @xmath3 and @xmath4 are sent for 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "for the current transmitted symbol of @xmath20 , probability of successful decoding for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are computed as follows : + @xmath28 for the proposed binary mocsk ( bmocsk ) , if the molecules of type @xmath13 is used in the current slot , the probability of successful decoding can be computed as follows : @xmath29these conditional probabilities for quaternary and higher modulation level cases can be calculated similarly .",
    "let @xmath30 be the error event . for bcsk , the average probability of error is equal to @xmath31 . as the decoding of the current symbol is dependent on",
    "both the last transmitted and decoded symbols in bcsk , we have:@xmath32when @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the probability that the previous symbol @xmath21 is falsely decoded to @xmath22 and can be substituted by @xmath35 .",
    "so when @xmath36 , @xmath34 will be equal to @xmath37 . therefore , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be computed recursively from ( [ eq : a ] ) which is a system of linear equations . for qcsk ( and higher ) levels ,",
    "the probability of error can be computed similarly . for the mosk ,",
    "the decoding of the current symbol is independent of the previous decoded symbol , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 is obtained as @xmath41    for the proposed mocsk , since the decoding of the current symbol is independent of both the transmitted and previous decoded symbols , @xmath40 is computed as follows @xmath42      in order to determine how well the modulation schemes considered above are , we examine a general molecular communication system with two molecule types @xmath3 and @xmath4 and a memory of only one symbol at the decoder ( since we are considering the class of simple and practical symbol - by - symbol decoders only ) .",
    "let @xmath43 be the @xmath44 input symbol ( assumed to be i.i.d . and",
    "uniform rv s over a set @xmath45 ) .",
    "the encoder uses @xmath46 to determine the diffusion rates @xmath47 and @xmath48 of molecules of type @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively at the @xmath44 time slot .",
    "thus the actual number of molecules that are diffused would follow independent poisson distributions with parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 . using the thinning property of poisson , the distribution of the numbers of molecules of type @xmath51",
    ", @xmath52 received at the receiver in the @xmath44 time slot is @xmath53 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath14 are defined in section ii - c .",
    "the current input symbol is decoded as @xmath54 based on the @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( the previous decoded symbol ) .",
    "the average probability of error is : @xmath57using the following lemma , a lower bound on @xmath40 is derived . + * lemma 1 .",
    "* @xmath58 is bounded from above as follows : @xmath59    the following chain of inequalities proves ( [ eq : lemma]).@xmath60    inequality ( a ) holds because @xmath54 is function of @xmath61 ; ( b ) holds as @xmath56 does not provide further information about @xmath62 conditioned on @xmath63 . equality ( c ) holds because @xmath62 is independent of previous message bits .",
    "( d ) holds because of the markov chain @xmath64 .    using the well - known trick of taking a random index @xmath65 uniformly distributed on @xmath66 and independent of previously defined rv s",
    ", one can show @xmath67 , and the statement of lemma 1 for random index @xmath65 instead of fix index @xmath68 .",

    "this inequality gives a lower bound on the average probability of error .",
    "our analysis also extends to @xmath85 types of molecules in a straightforward way ; it is omitted due to lack of space .",

    "this figure shows that bmocsk substantially outperforms the bmosk , with two types of molecules being employed in the two schemes .",
    "for the quaternary level , as expected , mosk with more complicated transmitter and receivers employing four molecule types , yields a better performance compared to the proposed quaternary mocsk ( qmocsk ) that uses only two molecules types .",
