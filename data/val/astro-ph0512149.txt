    "the observations of x - ray flashes ( xrf ) are providing important information for understanding the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "the detailed studies of xrfs started few years ago based on bepposax observations @xcite , but x - ray rich events had already been detected by the @xmath6 satellite .",
    "@xcite reported that soft x - ray emission below 10 kev co - exists with @xmath7-ray emission of grbs .",
    "about 36% of the bright bursts observed by @xmath6 have @xmath0 energy , which is the photon energy at which the @xmath8f@xmath9 spectrum peaks , around a few kev and also show large x - ray to @xmath7-ray fluence ratios @xcite .    the wide field cameras ( wfc ) on - board the @xmath10sax satellite observed 17 xrfs in five years @xcite .",
    "@xcite searched for grbs and xrfs which were observed in both wfc and batse .",
    "the wfc and batse joint spectral analysis of xrfs shows that their @xmath0 energies are significantly lower than those of the batse @xmath0 distribution @xcite .",
    "the systematic study of the spectral properties of xrfs observed by @xmath11 - 2 also supports this result @xcite .",
    "the afterglow detection and the redshift measurement from the host galaxy of xrf 020903 , which is one of the softest xrf observed by @xmath11 - 2 , shows the dramatic progress in understanding the nature of xrfs .",
    "the prompt emission of xrf 020903 has @xmath0 @xmath12 5.0 kev which is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of typical grbs .",
    "the optical transient and the host galaxy of xrf 020903 were detected .",
    "further spectroscopic observation of the host galaxy suggests that the redshift is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath3 and the peak energy at the source frame @xmath4 using the redshift of the host galaxy , and found that xrf 020903 follows an extension of the empirical relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath4 found by @xcite for grbs ( a.k.a .",
    "amati relation ) .",
    "this result provides the observational evidence that xrfs and grbs form a continuum and are a single phenomenon .    in this paper , we report the prompt emission properties of xrf 050416a observed by burst alert telescope ( bat ) on - board the @xmath14 satellite .",
    "the x - ray flash , xrf 050416a , was detected and localized by the @xmath14 @xcite burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) at 11:04:44.5 utc on 2005 april 16 @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 autonomously slewed to the bat on - board position , and both @xmath14 x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and uv - optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) detected the afterglow ( cusumano et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in preparation , holland et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in preparation ) .",
    "the afterglow emission of xrf 050416a was also observed by ground observatories at various wavelengths @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the host galaxy is faint and blue with large amount of the star formation and its redshift is z = 0.6535 @xmath15 0.0002 . throughout this paper ,",
    "the quoted errors are the 90% confidence level and the sky coordinates in j2000 unless we state otherwise in the text .",
    "the bat data analysis was performed using the swift software package ( heasoft 6.0 ) .",
    "the background was subtracted using the modulations of the coded aperture ( mask - weighting technique ) . in this technique ,",
    "photons with energies higher than 150 kev become transparent to the coded mask and these photons are treated as a background .",
    "thus , in this mask - weighted technique the effective bat energy range is from 14 kev to 150 kev .",
    "figure [ fig : bat_lc ] shows the energy resolved bat light curves of xrf 050416a .",
    "it is clear that the signal of the burst is only visible below 50 kev .",
    "the burst signal is composed of two peaks .",
    "the first peak has a triangular shape with the rise time longer than the decay time .",
    "when we calculate the spectral lag @xcite between the 2550 kev and 15 - 25 kev band , the cross - correlation function lag is @xmath160.066@xmath17 second ( 1@xmath18 error ) .",
    "these temporal characteristics are very unusual for the typical grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) , thus , it is difficult to understand them in the frame work of the standard internal shocks models in which the rise time is always shorter than the decay time and the hard emission always exceeds the soft emission ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the 15 - 150 kev band are 2.4 and 0.8 seconds , respectively .",
    "this @xmath19 belongs to the shortest part of the `` long grb '' classification based on the batse duration distribution @xcite .",
    "the fluence ratio between the 15 - 25 kev band and the 25 - 50 kev band of 1.5 makes this burst one of the softest grbs observed by bat so far .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : bat_lc ] shows the count ratio between the 25 - 50 kev and 15 - 25 kev bands .",
    "the spectral softening is clearly visible during the first and the second peak .",
    "as reported by the bat team , we applied the energy - dependent systematic error vector in the spectral files before doing any fitting procedure .",
    "the background subtracted ( mask - weighted ) spectral data were used in the analysis .",
    "the xspec v11.3.1 software package was used for fitting the data from 14 kev to 150 kev to the model spectrum .",
    "table [ table : fluence_peakflux ] shows the fluences and the peak photon fluxes in the various energy bands .",
    "these fluences and peak photon fluxes were derived directly from fitting the time - averaged and 1-s peak spectra respectively assuming the band function with @xmath21 .",
    "table [ table : spec_para ] summarizes the spectral parameters of the bat time - averaged spectrum and the band function ( band ) : @xmath22 , if @xmath23 and @xmath24\\}^{\\alpha-\\beta }   \\exp ( \\beta - \\alpha ) ( e/30)^{\\beta}$ ] , if @xmath25 . ] .",
    "figure [ fig : bat_spec ] shows the time - averaged spectrum , accumulated over the time interval from @xmath160.5 seconds to 3 seconds since the bat trigger time , was fitted with a simple power - law model . the photon index @xmath26 which is much steeper than @xmath27 strongly indicates that the bat observed the higher energy part of the band function @xcite .",
    "motivated by this result , and also by the fact that almost all of grb and xrf spectra are well described by the band function @xcite , we tried to fit the spectrum with the band function assuming the low energy photon index @xmath28 to be fixed at @xmath29 , which is the typical value for both grbs",
    "@xcite and xrfs @xcite .",
    "the fitting shows a significant improvement from a simple power - law model to the band function of @xmath30 of 7.75 for 1 degree of freedom . to quantify the significance of this improvement",
    ", we performed 10,000 spectral simulations assuming our best fit spectral parameters in a simple power - law model , and determined in how many cases the band function fit gives @xmath31 improvements of equal or greater than 7.75 over the simple power - law .",
    "we found equal or higher improvements in @xmath31 in 62 simulated spectra out of 10,000 .",
    "thus , the chance probability of having an equal or higher @xmath32 of 7.75 with the band function , when the parent distribution is a case of a simple power - law model is 0.6% . the observed @xmath33 energy , @xmath0 , is well constrained at 15.6@xmath1 kev , and it confirms the soft nature of this burst .",
    "we also applied a @xmath34 band function fit @xcite to the bat spectrum to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 is consistent with the band function fit of the fixed @xmath28 to @xmath29 : 9.9 kev @xmath12 @xmath0 @xmath12 20.0 kev at the 68% confidence level , 5.1 kev @xmath12 @xmath0 @xmath12 21.8 kev at the 90% confidence level , and @xmath0 @xmath12 23.0 kev at the 99% confidence level .",
    "the low energy response is crucial for the determination of the spectral parameters of an xrf and also , as reported by the bat team , there is a known problem of @xmath35 15% smaller effective area in the crab spectrum below 20 kev when fitting with a pre - launch response matrix . since the post - launch response matrix which we used in the analysis was applying a correction to force the crab spectrum to fit a canonical model from 14 kev to 150 kev , and because we were also also applying the systematic error vectors before performing the spectral analysis , the systematic effect of this low energy problem",
    "is very limited .",
    "however , we investigated the spectrum of xrf 050416a ignoring the spectral bins below 20 kev . even without using spectral bins below 20 kev ,",
    "the photon index of xrf 050416a is @xmath36 , much steeper than @xmath27 ( @xmath37 at the @xmath38 99.99% confidence level ) .",
    "furthermore , we took the ratio of the spectral data of xrf 050416a and the crab nebula observed at a similar incident angle to xrf 050416a .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : crab_ratio ] .",
    "the flattening trend of the photon index below 25 kev is also clear in this figure .",
    "thus , we conclude that the deviation from a simple power - law model below 25 kev is a real features of the spectrum of xrf 050416a .",
    "one of the most important discoveries related to xrf 050416a is the confirmation of the @xmath4  @xmath3 relation @xcite .",
    "we calculate the @xmath33 energy at the grb rest frame , @xmath4 , and the isotropic - equivalent energy ( 1  10@xmath39 kev at the rest frame ) , @xmath3 , using the redshift of the host galaxy ( z=0.6535 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath21 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 of xrf 050416a are 25.1@xmath40 kev and @xmath41 erg , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : epeak_eiso ] shows the data point of xrf 050416a with the known redshift grbs of @xmath10sax and @xmath42 sample @xcite .",
    "xrf 050416a not only follows the @xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath44 relation , but also fills in the gap of the relation around @xmath4 of 30  80 kev .",
    "this result tightens the validity of this relation at five orders of magnitude in @xmath3 and at three orders of magnitude in @xmath4 .",
    "xrf 050416a bridges the gap between xrfs which have @xmath4 of less than 10 kev and grbs in the @xmath4  @xmath3 relation .    the confirmation of @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath3 relation from xrfs to grbs gives us a clear indication that xrfs and grbs form a continuum and are a single phenomenon .",
    "there are several jet models to explain a unified picture of xrfs and grbs .",
    "the off - axis jet model @xcite , the structured jet model @xcite , and the variable jet opening angle model @xcite are the most popular models in this aspect .",
    "on the other hand , there are theoretical models to explain xrfs in the frame work of the internal shock model @xcite and of the external shock model @xcite .",
    "the cited jet models and internal / external shock models not only explain the existences of xrfs , under certain assumptions , but also , in some of their realizations or for some values of their parameters , they can predict the @xmath4  @xmath3 correlation .    according to the xrt afterglow observation of xrf 050416a , the decay slope of the afterglow emission is @xmath35 @xmath45 from 0.015 days to @xmath35 34.7 days after the grb trigger without any signature of a jet break ( cusumano et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in preparation ; @xcite ) .",
    "using @xmath4 and @xmath3 of xrf 050416a measured by bat , we can estimate the jet break time using the relation between @xmath4 and the jet collimation - corrected energy @xmath46 found by @xcite ( ghirlanda relation ) .",
    "however , there is a debate about the assumption of the jet model used by @xcite to derive the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath46 @xcite . based on this argument",
    ", we use the empirical relation between @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the jet break time at the rest frame , @xmath47 , derived by @xcite .",
    "note that there is no assumption of a jet model in the formula found by @xcite , and thus their relation is purely based on observational properties .",
    "when we use the equation ( 5 ) in @xcite , ( @xmath48 , the jet break time in the observer s frame is estimated to be @xmath35 1.5 days after the grb on - set time .",
    "note that this estimated jet break time is consistent with the estimation using the ghirlanda relation assuming the circum - burst density of 3 @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the estimated jet break time using the empirical @xmath4-@xmath3- @xmath47 relation is inconsistent with the null detection of a jet break until more than 34.3 days after the trigger by xrt .    in the off - axis jet model @xcite",
    ", the null detection of the jet break in the xrt data of xrf 050416a could be difficult to explain .",
    "when we assume a bulk lorentz factor of 100 , @xmath4 of 300 kev for an on - axis observer , and a jet opening angle of 2 degrees , the viewing angle from the jet on - axis is estimated to be @xmath35 4 degrees from the observed @xmath4 of 25 kev . according to @xcite , when observing the jet from an angle two times larger than the jet opening angle , we would expect to see a rise in the flux around one day after the burst .",
    "it is possible to increase the bulk lorentz factor and to reduce the off - axis viewing angle to achieve the same doppler factor .",
    "however , in this case , the afterglow light curve should be close to the on - axis case , thus , we would expect to see the jet break around the time we estimated .    on the other hand , the variable jet opening angle model @xcite might work for xrf 050416a if @xmath5 is a constant value .",
    "if we assume the values typical for grbs ( @xmath4 = 300 kev and the jet opening angle of 5 degrees ) , the jet opening angle of xrf 050416a is calculated to be 52 degrees because of the inverse relation between @xmath4 and the jet opening angle in the case in which @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "when we used the formulation of @xcite applying the estimated jet opening angle , the jet break time will be 64 days in the case of the circum - burst density of 10 @xmath49 .",
    "both properties of the low @xmath4 and the null detection of the jet break could be explained in the variable jet opening angle model if @xmath5 is constant .",
    "however , as @xcite showed , @xmath5 is not a constant parameter , but has a good correlation with @xmath4 .",
    "when we applied the ghirlanda relation , @xmath50 , in the variable opening angle model , and re - calculated the jet break time , the break time will be 0.7 days assuming the circum - burst density of 10 @xmath49 . in the variable jet opening angle model",
    ", there is no way to explain both the ghirlanda relation and the null detection of the jet break by xrt simultaneously .",
    "one natural way to explain the non - detection of the jet break feature is that extra components are overlaid around a jet break time period . according to the afterglow calculations in the x - ray band by @xcite ,",
    "there are several possibilities to hide a jet break feature due to some kinds of emission by the external shock .",
    "these are the external shock emission from 1 ) the dense clouds surrounding a grb progenitor ( e.g. @xcite ) , 2 ) a moderately relativistic cocoon component of a two - component jet ( e.g. @xcite ) , and 3 ) a jet with large fluctuations in angular direction ( patchy jets ; ) . on the other hand",
    ", it might be the case that xrfs indeed do not show the signature of a jet break in the afterglow .",
    "indeed although the numbers in the sample are limited , there is no clear observational indication of a jet break in any xrf afterglow light curve so far . if the later case is true , we need to change our view of xrfs completely .",
    "thus , the multi - wavelength observations of the xrf afterglows will be crucial to investigate whether a jet break feature exists in xrfs or not .",
