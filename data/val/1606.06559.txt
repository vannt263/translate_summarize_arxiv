    "speciation requires the evolution of reproductive isolation between initially compatible individuals @xcite .",
    "one of the most accepted mechanisms for the development of reproductive barriers is the geographic isolation of the populations , which can be complete ( allopatry ) or partial ( parapatry ) @xcite . in both cases",
    "the reduction of gene flow between individuals inhabiting different regions facilitates the fixation of local adaptations .",
    "these , in turn , may lead to pre - zygotic or post - zygotic mating incompatibilities and can eventually develop into full reproductive isolation .",
    "sympatric speciation , where new species arise from a population inhabiting a single geographic region , has been highly debated @xcite and its occurrence in nature is documented in only a few cases @xcite .",
    "mathematical models have shown that sympatric speciation is theoretically possible @xcite and the model by dieckmann and doebeli @xcite , in particular , attracted a lot of attention . in their model , speciation results from the interplay between strong competition for resources and the way resources are distributed .",
    "it was shown that , under appropriate conditions , the population will evolve in such a way as to consume the most abundant type of resource , but it will arrive at the corresponding ` optimal ' phenotype in a minimum of the fitness landscape , causing it to split in two",
    ". the resulting system of two subpopulations with different phenotypes would then be at a fitness maximum .",
    "for sexually reproducing individuals the evolution of reproductive barriers between the two nearly split populations would need a further ingredient , assortative mating .",
    "this is tendency of individuals to mate with others that are similar to themselves and prevents the mixing of the two subpopulations . in the model assortative mating",
    "was shown to evolve naturally because only then the fitness maximum could be achieved . in spite of its theoretical plausibility , this and",
    "other models have been criticized for their supposedly unrealistic assumptions @xcite .",
    "more surprising than sympatric speciation under strong selection is the possibility of sympatric speciation in a neutral scenario @xcite .",
    "it was shown by derrida and higgs ( dh ) @xcite that a population of initially identical individuals subjected only to mutations and assortative mating can indeed split into species in sympatry if the genomes are infinitely large .",
    "the hypothesis of genomes containing infinitely many loci , though not new @xcite , raises important questions about the meaning of a locus ( a gene , the position of a base - pair on a chromosome or other replicating molecule ) and the actual number of such loci that would be necessary for speciation to occur , since , after all , genes or base - pairs are always finite .",
    "moreover , the model assumes that all these infinitely many loci are involved in assortative mating , which also needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of the loci .    in this paper",
    "we consider the dh model for finite genomes .",
    "we find that , for the parameters considered in the original paper , speciation occurs only for very large number of loci , of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "we compare the dynamics of the model for finite number of loci with the infinite loci model and show how the broadening of the genetic distribution of genotypes in the finite loci model prevents the onset of speciation .",
    "we also compare the finite loci dh model with a spatial version of the dynamics introduced in @xcite . when space is added and reproduction is restricted by assortative mating and spatial proximity , the minimum number of loci needed for speciation drops by several orders of magnitude and can occur even for as few as 100 loci .",
    "our simulations show that when the number of loci is small species form in well defined spatial regions , with little overlap at the boundaries .",
    "when the number of loci is large , on the other hand , space becomes less important and the species overlap considerably more in space .",
    "the model introduced by derrida and higgs @xcite considers a sympatric population of @xmath1 haploid individuals whose genomes are represented by binary strings of size @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , can assume the values @xmath5 . for simplicity , each locus of the genome will be called a gene and the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 the corresponding alleles .",
    "the number of individuals at each generation is kept constant and the population is characterized by an @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 measuring the degree of genetic similarity between pairs of individuals : @xmath10 if the genomes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are identical @xmath13 whereas two genomes with random entries will have @xmath14 close to zero .",
    "alternatively , the genetic distance between the individuals , measuring the number of genes bearing different alleles , is @xmath15 .",
    "each generation is constructed from the previous one as follows : a first parent @xmath16 is chosen at random .",
    "the second parent @xmath17 has to be genetically compatible with the first , i.e. , their degree of similarity has to satisfy @xmath18 . in other words",
    "parents must have at least @xmath19 genes bearing the same allele to be compatible ( assortative mating ) .",
    "individuals @xmath17 are then randomly selected until this condition is met . if no such individual is found , @xmath16 is discarded and a new first parent is selected .",
    "the offspring inherits , gene by gene , the allele of either parent with equal probability ( sexual reproduction ) .",
    "the process is repeated until @xmath1 offspring have been generated .",
    "individuals are also subjected to a mutation rate @xmath20 per gene , which is typically small .",
    "the model is neutral in the sense that the probability that an individual is chosen as first parent ( @xmath21 ) does not depend on its genome .",
    "however , once the first parent has been selected , the chances of being picked as second parent and produce an offspring does depend on the genome and a fitness measure can actually be defined in association with assortativeness @xcite .    to understand how the similarity matrix changes through generations , consider first an asexual population where each individual @xmath11 has a single parent @xmath22 in previous generation .",
    "the allele @xmath4 will be equal to @xmath23 with probability @xmath24 and @xmath25 with probability @xmath26 , so that the expected value is @xmath27 for independent genes , the expected value of the similarity between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is , therefore , @xmath28 in sexual populations @xmath11 and @xmath12 have two parents each , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , respectively , and since each inherits ( on the average ) half the alleles from each parent , it follows that , on the average , @xmath33 with @xmath34 .    in the limit of infinitely many genes ,",
    "@xmath35 , this expression becomes exact and the entire dynamics can be obtained by simply updating the similarity matrix . if there is no restriction on mating , @xmath36 , the overlaps @xmath14 converge to a stationary distribution centered at @xmath37 .",

    "as discussed in section [ sm ] , the construction of spatial models that converge to the finite dh model as the parameter s becomes large is not straightforward .",

    "the results obtained with this variation are qualitatively identical to those described in sections [ dh ] and [ dhf ] .",
    "this validates the comparison of the dh finite genome model with the spatial model introduced in section [ sm ] .",

    "occurs for any value of @xmath71 , small or large . for small @xmath71 local mating",
    "creates a spatial distribution of genotypes where nearby individuals tend to be similar but different from others located far away @xcite . for finite populations",
    "this genetic gradient is not smooth , but step - like , and prone to break up into genetically isolated groups that are spatially correlated .",
    "speciation happens not because @xmath2 is large , but because @xmath71 is small . for large @xmath71 ,",
    "on the other hand , the mechanism is very different and takes place on the global scale of the population .",
    "the balance between mutations , which generally increases the average genetic distance between two individuals , and sexual reproduction , which mixes the genomes and has the opposite effect , leads to a distribution of genetic distances in the population .",
    "only when this distribution becomes wide enough , as compared with the criterion of assortative mating , the population splits into species .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the resulting populations in each case , where a signature of @xmath71 is clearly seen in the spatial organization of the species .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for the origin of species remain controversial @xcite . among the important questions yet to be fully understood is the role of geography ( allopatric , parapatric and sympatric modes ) and the number of genes involved in the evolution of reproductive isolation .",
    "it has been recently argued that these two points are closely related and that detailed molecular analysis might reveal the geographic mode behind specific speciation events @xcite .",
    "sympatric speciation has been thought to be the most unlikely of the modes , since the possibility of constant gene flow would keep the populations mixed and prevent the evolution of reproductive barriers @xcite .",
    "dieckmann and collaborators have argued that this is not so if competition for resources is strong enough @xcite . in that case",
    "reproductive isolation would not only evolve naturally but would _ require _ sympatry , otherwise competition for local resources would not be intense @xcite",
    ".    surprisingly , derrida and higgs have shown that sympatric speciation may occur even without competition , in a totally neutral scenario , if mating is assortative and if the number of loci in the genome can be considered infinite @xcite .",
    "when loci are interpreted as genes the hypothesis of an infinitely large genome becomes rather unrealistic .",
    "however , at the molecular level , where nucleotide sequences are the units to be considered , infinite loci models become attractive @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , nucleotides can hardly be considered independent and certainly do not segregate in the way as assumed by the dh models .",
    "understanding how many independently segregating loci are necessary for neutral sympatric speciation is , therefore , an important question .",
    "the main parameters controlling the dynamics in the dh model are @xmath105 and the assortativity measure @xmath40 .",
    "the combination @xmath106 also appears in hubbell s neutral theory of biodiversity @xcite and is the _",
    "fundamental biodiversity number _ , since it controls the number of species in a community and the abundance distribution .    in this paper",
    "we have revisited the dh model and simulated it for finite numbers of loci .",
    "we found that , for typical parameters used in the original paper , speciation happens only for very large number of loci , of the order of @xmath0 . when the number of loci is small , the genetic variability within the population is large , hindering speciation .",
    "the histogram of genetic similarity between individuals evolves into a broad peak instead of multiple sharp peaks that represent groups of very similar individuals that are dissimilar among different groups .",
    "as the number of genes increase the peaks become thiner , secondary structures appear and eventually turn into species .",
    "increasing the mutation rate and keeping @xmath56 fixed decreases the minimum number of loci needed and also the time to speciation .",
    "in contrast with the sympatric dh model , the spatial model introduced in @xcite displays speciation with much smaller number of loci . the model considers a population that is uniformly distributed in space , without any explicit separation into demes or subpopulations .",
    "although it falls into the class of parapatric models , it has been termed topopatric to distinguish it from models involving demes or metapopulations @xcite .",
    "mating is restricted not only by genetic similarity but also by spatial proximity , allowing gene flow across the entire population but substantially reducing the speed of the flow .",
    "mutations are transmitted diffusively across the population , and not instantaneously like in the sympatric model , largely facilitating speciation @xcite .",
    "previous studies with metapopulation models ( and infinitely large genomes ) observed similar effects , with speciation occurring for smaller mutation rates due to the isolation of subpopulations @xcite . for small number of genes , of the order of 100 ,",
    "speciation occurs only with severe spatial mating restrictions .",
    "accordingly , the species that form display strong spatial segregation , with little overlap between adjacent species ( figs . [ fighds](b ) and [ fig5](a ) ) .",
    "this type of geographic distribution leads back to question of modes of speciation and suggests that it might happen that species appeared not because the populations were geographically separated ( as in allopatry ) but rather they are geographically separated because they emerged in a homogeneous environment with slow gene flow .",
    "if the number of loci participating in the assortative process is large the spatial restriction on mating can be relaxed . as a consequence , the spatial segregation decreases and the overlap among species increases .",
