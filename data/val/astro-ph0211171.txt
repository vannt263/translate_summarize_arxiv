    "many production sites of the p - nuclei have been proposed : oxygen / neon layers of highly evolved massive stars during their presupernova phase ( arnould 1976 ) and during their supernova explosion ( woosley & howard 1978 ) ; x - ray novae ( schatz et al .",

    "the most promising is the oxygen / neon layers during type ii supernova explosion .",
    "the p - nuclei are synthesized by the photodisintegrations of s - nuclei ( s - process seeds ) produced in the layers during the core helium burning in the progenitor .",
    "photodisintegrate ( @xmath7 ) reactions are followed by ( @xmath8 ) and/or ( @xmath9 ) reactions .",
    "the production of p - nuclei via the subsequent photodisintegrations is referred to as a p - process .",

    "however , the model has a conspicuous shortcoming of underproduction of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "abundant productions of such p - nuclei have been invoked to neutrino processes ( woosley et al .",

    "2001 ) .    during supernova explosion in massive stars , certain fraction of ejected matter is expected to fall back onto a new - born compact object with supercritical accretion rates greater than @xmath15 ( woosley & weaver 1995 , hereafter ww95 ) , where @xmath16 is the critical mass accretion rate given by @xmath17 with the eddington luminosity , @xmath2 .",

    "we propose a ssad as a candidate for the production of p - nuclei . in  2 , we present a model of ssads and a nuclear network to calculate the abundance evolution inside a ssad .",
    "we also discuss possible progenitors for p - process nucleosynthesis inside ssads and the initial chemical abundances of the fallback material far from the central compact remnant . in  3 , we describe abundance distributions of p - nuclei inside ssads , ejected masses of these nuclei from ssads , and effects of proton and helium contamination of the fallback gas via rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "we discuss our results in  4 and finally present concluding remarks in  5 .",

    "it is noted that in ssads with @xmath29 advective cooling dominates over radiative and neutrino cooling ; it balances with viscous energy generation .",
    "a disk is also assumed to be extended from the last stable circular orbit around a black hole to the location of accretion shock @xmath30 ( fryer , colgate & pinto 1999 ; macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ) .",

    ", supernova explosion can not take place and collapsed matter forms a black hole promptly ( f99 ) .",
    "several seconds after the core collapse a quasi - steady accretion disk is formed around the hole if the progenitor has sufficient angular momentum ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , which is in a reasonable range of a progenitor model of heger , langer & woosley ( 2000 ) .",
    "highly variable supercritical accretion with 0.010.1 @xmath55 is maintained for approximately 1020 s ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "for such high accretion rates , however , the accretion disk has enough high temperature ( @xmath56 k ) for accreting gas to contain only protons and neutrons ( popham , fryer & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , the progenitors with @xmath54 is irrelevant for p - process nucleosynthesis inside ssads .    while for progenitors with @xmath57@xmath58 a neutron star is formed soon after the core collapse .",
    "supernova launches outward - going shock successfully but some fraction of supernova ejecta falls back onto the nascent neutron star , which is transformed to a black hole via massive fallback ( f99 ) .",
    "the accreting matter onto the hole forms a disk with @xmath59@xmath60 lasting for hundreds to thousands of seconds ( macfadyen et al .",
    "after most of silicon layers of the progenitors has fallen back into the hole , the accretion rate is declined as @xmath61 ( chevalier 1989 ; macfadyen et al .",
    "2001 ) and compositions of the accreting matter are those of explosively burned oxygen / neon layers via supernova shock . in a @xmath62 progenitor model ( hashimoto 1995 ) ,",
    "the position of @xmath32 ( @xmath63 ) is far from the core and located at @xmath64 , or the oxygen / neon layer , where the peak temperature during the shock propagation is too low to proceed appreciable nuclear burning of s - process seeds ( @xmath65 k ) .",
    "the material still leaves the s - process seeds even after the supernova explosion .",
    "appreciable amounts of the seeds can fall back onto the compact object through the accretion disk . accordingly",
    ", p - process nucleosynthesis operates inside a supercritical accretion disk driven by supernova explosion of the progenitors with @xmath57@xmath58 .",
    "chemical composition of fallback matter depends on masses of progenitors and fallback mechanisms .",
    "because p - process nucleosynthesis inside ssads needs s - process seeds , we set the compositions of the accreting gas at @xmath32 to be averaged compositions of oxygen / neon layers of the progenitors of 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 @xmath66 , whose models are refererred to as m10 , m20 , m30 , and m40 , respectively .",

    "( prantzos , hashimoto & nomoto 1990a ) .",
    "although the progenitors with masses of @xmath67 are unlikely to be relevant for p - process inside a ssad , we also calculate abundances of p - nuclei for m10 because the abundance pattern is different from the others ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that these abundances were also adopted as the seed abundances in the p - process models of rayet et al .",

    "the initial abundances of m30 are in between those of m20 and m40 .",
    "the solar abundances are also depicted with the filled circles ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "compositions of fallback matter are not those of the oxygen / neon layers of the progenitors but those of explosively burned layers because of supernova shock heating . abundances of p - nuclei produced inside ssads depend on amounts of s - process seeds , as we can see later .",
    "the explosively burned layers where the peak temperature of a shock wave is lower than 2@xmath68 still contain comparable s - process seeds to those before the explosion .",
    "accordingly , the initial compositions of the oxygen / neon layers of the progenitors are relevant for our p - process model inside ssads at least for fallback of the layers with relatively low peak temperature @xmath69 .",
    "the compositions of fallback material discussed above are possibly altered when large - scale matter mixing is significant in supernova explosion .",
    "such mixing is probably associated with fallback .",
    "hence , we shall discuss effects of matter mixing on p - process nucleosynthesis in  3.3 .",
    "as fallback material accretes onto a central object , temperature and density of the gas increase ( see equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) and thus abundances of the accreting gas are changed through a sequence of nuclear reactions from an initial composition described in  2.4 . using the nuclear reaction network and the self - similar solution , we can follow the evolution of the chemical composition inside ssads during the infall toward the compact object through post - processing calculations for m10 , m20 , m30 , and m40 .",
    "the calculations are carried out from @xmath32 to @xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that the nuclear energy generation is assumed to be much smaller than the viscous heating .    for disks with @xmath70 ,",
    "the maximum temperature of disks is less than @xmath71 k which is the minimum temperature for the p - process to proceed in the so called _ p - process layers _ ( ppls ) in type ii supernovae ( rayet et al .  1990 , 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , p - process nucleosynthesis does not operate in the disks for such low accretion rates . for higher accretion rates ,",
    "the accreting gas has higher temperature and the p - process can proceed significantly .",
    "the abundance distributions of p - nuclei are similar for the disks with various accretion rates , while the production site of p - nuclei shifts toward the outer part of the disk as the accretion rates increase .",
    "thus , we show the results of @xmath72 as a representative case .",

    ", @xmath76 increases via neutron capture of @xmath81 , contained in the fallback material initially . as the gas moves to the inner part of the disk , the temperature increases and the heavy p - nuclei ( @xmath82 ) , such as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77",
    "are rapidly destroyed through @xmath83 reactions . at @xmath84 ( @xmath85 k ) , however , these isotopes are drastically produced .",
    "this is due to the photodisintegrations of the neutron - rich seed elements when the temperature of the accreting gas attains to @xmath86 k comparable to ppls ( rayet et al .",
    "thus , the p - processes operate efficiently inside the accretion disk as in the ppls .",
    "the intermediate p - nuclei ( @xmath87 ) also enhance via the p - process .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath88 0.11 @xmath89 in this region is comparable to the time - scale of shock propagation through ppls ( rayet et al .",

    "dominate over @xmath83 reactions ; while for the light p - nuclei ( @xmath94 ) , such as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath83 reactions are still dominant processes .",
    "the light p - nuclei are eventually depleted via @xmath92 and @xmath93 reactions near @xmath95 ( @xmath96 k ) .",
    "it is noted that the abundance profiles for all models are similar , while the more p - nuclei are produced the more massive are progenitors because of the richness of s - process seeds ( figure 1 ) .",
    "many astrophysical objects involving an accretion disk are observed to produce jets and/or winds ( e.g. , livio 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "hence , as the accreting gas falls back onto the central object , some fraction of gas is possibly ejected from the disk via jets and/or winds .",
    "the processed material ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath97 is supposed to be ejected .",

    "to calculate @xmath148 for ssads , we need an estimation of the total fallback mass with s - process seeds , @xmath150 .",
    "an amount of fallback material has been estimated by ww95 and f99 through numerical simulations of core collapse and supernova explosion .",
    "amounts of fallback material @xmath151 are presented in table 3 for the fallback models of ww95 and f99 . to operate the p - process in ssads ,",
    "fallback material should contain the s - process seeds .",
    "accordingly , to calculate @xmath150 , besides the amount of fallback matter , both the abundance distribution of the progenitor and the peak temperature of the supernova shock are needed . in table 3 , we also show the mass coordinate of the base of oxygen burning layers , @xmath152 and the mass coordinate where the peak temperature is @xmath71 k , @xmath153 for the progenitor and explosion models with masses of 15 , 20 , 25 , and 40 @xmath0 ( hashimoto 1995 ) .",
    "all s - process seeds are assumed to be destroyed in the region of the mass coordinate @xmath154 and thus disk p - process can operate only for fallback material with @xmath155 . hence we can estimate @xmath150 , which are also presented in table 3 , for ww95 and f99 .",
    "for the fallback model of ww95 , @xmath156 is estimated as 2.41@xmath0 provided that @xmath153 for the 30@xmath0 progenitor is equal to that of the 25@xmath0 progenitor .",
    "for the fallback model of f99 , we set simply @xmath157 $ ] and @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "moreover , some fractions of synthesized p - nuclei inside ssads are ejected from the disks via jets and/or winds as in many objects associated with an accretion disk ( e.g. , livio 1999 ) .",
    "we assume that the ratio @xmath159 of the mass ejection rate @xmath160 to the mass accretion rate is constant in time , or @xmath161 .",
    "hence the total ejected mass is also expressed as @xmath162 .",
    "the ratio @xmath159 are 0.0010.01 ( eggum , coroniti & katz 1988 ) and 0.030.1 ( kudoh , matsumoto & shibata 1998 ) estimated from numerical simulations of jets originated from an accretion disk .",
    "however , @xmath159 may be larger as suggested by observations in x - ray binaries ; ss433 ( kotani 1997 ) and grs 1915 + 105 ( fender & pooley 2000 ; belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) .    using the calculated values of @xmath118 for our ssad models ( table 2 )",
    ", we evaluate @xmath148 as 1.640 @xmath163 and 2.864 @xmath163 with the estimation of amounts of fallback matter of ww95 and f99 , respectively , where @xmath164 .",
    "thus @xmath148 for ssads are smaller than that for supernovae ( @xmath165 ) unless @xmath159 is as large as 0.1 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath148 slightly decreases for a steep imf slope with @xmath166 ( e.g. , kroupta 2002 ) and also reduce by 3050% if @xmath167 .",
    "we proceed the case of fallback with complete proton mixing .",
    "we assume matter contains proton of @xmath123 throughout fallback .",
    "the proton mixing needs the hydrogen envelope of progenitors , which is decreased due to mass loss for massive progenitors ( e.g. , chiosi & maeder 1986 ) .",
    "the upper limit @xmath141 possibly decreases for cases with proton mixing and are taken to be @xmath168 ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "as in the absence of matter mixing , we calculate @xmath148 as 5.027 @xmath163 and 9.583 @xmath163 for the fallback models of ww95 and f99 , respectively . here",
    "we set @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath148 compared with no proton mixing is responsible for the increase in @xmath118 for the models with proton mixing ( table 2 ) .",
    "hence , in the case with complete mixing , the ssads - origin p - nuclei are likely to comparably contribute to the chemical evolution of p - nuclei as the supernovae - origin p - nuclei .",
    "in particular , ssads probably have significant contribution to the @xmath3 evolution .",
    "overproduction of @xmath3 takes place for any @xmath36 ( figures 5 - 7 ) .",
    "accordingly , the overproduction is realized inside ssads throughout the duration in which a large fraction of fallback matter accretes onto a central compact object .",
    "even for the cases of small @xmath131 , @xmath3 is overproduced inside ssads ; this is the case of @xmath170 .",
    "thus , contribution to the @xmath3 evolution is considerable for a small amount of proton @xmath171 mixed into the fallback matter of 0.1 to several @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are overproduced only for the case of @xmath132 .",
    "the accretion rate of fallback matter is declined to relatively small accretion rates @xmath172 at several months after the explosion ( mineshige et al .",
    "1997 ) and large amounts of fallback matter have already accreted onto a central remnant . therefore , only a small amount of fallback matter are processed inside ssads , which are enable to overproduce @xmath4 and @xmath5 .      in ssads , p - nuclei",
    "are mainly produced in the region 2070@xmath173 for @xmath72 ( figure 2 ) where an accreting gas is mainly ejected via winds .",
    "parent nuclei which decay into p - nuclei through @xmath107-decays are also expelled via winds and thus enhance amounts of p - nuclei .",
    "taking into account the @xmath107-decays after freeze out , we estimate abundances of p - nuclei ejected from a ssad . we find that p - nuclei other than @xmath3 , @xmath128 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are not appreciably increased via @xmath107-decays of their parent nuclei ; their ratio after to before @xmath107-decays are 1.100 , 1.215 , 13.77 , and 18.33 , respectively , for m20 . here",
    "all the parent nuclei has been assumed to decay to their daughter p - nuclei . when proton is abundantly mixed into fallback material ,",
    "the abundances of @xmath3 and @xmath128 are not significantly changed but @xmath110 and @xmath111 are largely enhanced . for m20p03 ( @xmath133 ) , the ratio of the abundances of @xmath110 , and @xmath111 after to before @xmath107-decays become 9.797 and 42.41 , respectively .",
    "however , the averaged opfs , @xmath118 , are not appreciably changed because of small opfs of @xmath110 and @xmath111 up to @xmath174 0.07 before @xmath107-decays ( figures 37 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath107-decays after freeze out has only minor effect on estimation of @xmath148 discussed in  4.1 .",
    "if a compact object breaks out a supernova remnant , matter fallback onto the object ceases .",
    "many observations reveal that pulsars have larger space velocities ( 2001000 @xmath175 ) than those of their progenitor ( e.g. , lai et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "such high velocities are invoked to kicks of nascent neutron stars via asymmetric supernova explosions . the supercritical accretion ( @xmath176 )",
    "investigated in the present paper is realized until about 4 years after an explosion ( mineshige et al .",
    "the expansion velocity of the supernova remnant is much larger than the typical kick velocity of pulsars .",
    "the material therefore continues to fall back during the supercritical accretion of our interest .",
    "however , the later expansion of the remnant is decelerated by ambient material from progenitor winds .",
    "the pulsar eventually breaks through the supernova remnant and matter fallback onto it ceases .",
    "we have investigated the p - process nucleosynthesis inside ssads around a compact object of @xmath177 .",
    "supernova explosion of 2040@xmath0 progenitors is probably responsible for the p - process nucleosynthesis inside ssads .",
    "the chemical compositions of the accreting gas far from the central object have been assumed to be those of the oxygen / neon layers of the progenitor in the model of 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40@xmath66 stars .",
    "it is found that when @xmath176 the temperature of the accreting gas attains to @xmath178 k and appreciable nuclear reactions take place to produce the p - nuclei .",
    "we have also estimated the opfs of the p - nuclei in the ejected material from the accretion disks via jets and/or winds to compare the abundances of the ejected matter with the solar abundances .",
    "the resultant p - nuclei profiles have similar features to those for type ii supernovae ( rayet at al .",
    "the light and intermediate mass p - nuclei such as @xmath3 , @xmath128 , @xmath4 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath5 are underproduced .",
    "the amounts of p - nuclei and profiles of the opfs ejected from ssads depend on initial abundance distributions of s - process seeds .",
    "moreover , for investigating the effects of proton and helium contamination via large - scale mixing in a supernova explosion of fallback material on the p - process nucleosynthesis , we have added some fractions of proton or helium to the initial composition for the cases of 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40@xmath0 progenitors and calculated the opfs of the p - nuclei in the ejected material .",
    "it has been found that significant fractions of @xmath135 inclusion cause small changes in the opfs . even for a small amount of proton included in fallback material , p - nuclei",
    "are synthesized through not only photodisintegrations but radiative proton captures .",
    "the most prominent is an enhancement of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath5 is also overproduced for @xmath132 .",
    "if fallback matter includes abundant proton , appreciable amounts of the p - nuclei , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath134 , and @xmath130 , which are deficient in type ii supernovae , can be produced for @xmath132 , though the overall profiles of the opfs becomes worse compared with the solar ones .",
    "we have discussed the contribution from the p - process nucleosynthesis in ssads to galactic chemical evolution of p - nuclei . we conclude that p - process in ssads comparably contributes to chemical evolution of p - nuclei as in supernovae if several percents of fallback matter are ejected from ssads .",
    "in particular the p - process in ssads may be important for the chemical evolution of @xmath3 and possibly compensates the underproduction in type ii supernovae .",
    "contribution from ssads to the chemical evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is unlikely to be significant .",
    "numerical simulations of supernova - driven jets present the peculiar nucleosynthesis of the alpha - rich freeze out ( nagataki et al .",
    "1997 ) : the p - process will be affected by jets as sn1987a .",
    "some gamma - ray bursts are likely to be caused by aspherical jet - induced supernova explosions ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; macfadyen et al .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that in such explosions a ssad is formed around a new - born compact object and a substantial amount of fallback ( @xmath179 ) followed by mixing takes place ( fryer & heger 2000 ; hflich , khokhlov & wang 2001 ) .",
    "hence some gamma - ray bursts possibly accompany with the synthesis of p - nuclei ; our ssad p - process model would be responsible for the synthesis of p - nuclei in these bursts .",
