    "not only are sn ia events of interest as endpoints of stellar evolution , they have taken on a special importance because of their central role as standard candles .",
    "it was with these objects that the acceleration of the universe was first detected and they will likely play a central role in accurately measuring the acceleration parameters over cosmological time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this greater accuracy requires not only a large number of sne ia , but a good understanding of the supernova events .",
    "an important part of the picture is the set of conditions that cause white dwarfs to undergo a sn ia event .    within galaxies ,",
    "close binary systems are rare and they are generally not created through dynamical interaction but are formed with a sufficiently small separation",
    ". however , a different situation occurs in globular clusters because the dynamical interaction time is typically 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 yr .",
    "these interactions cause binaries to harden to the point that the constituent stars become close enough for mass transfer ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when this occurs , the star that expands beyond its roche lobe experiences roche lobe overflow and subsequent mass transfer to the more compact object .",
    "when the compact object is a neutron star , we obtain a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) , which can be quite luminous in x - rays , making them easy to identify .",
    "luminous x - ray binaries are seen in early - type galaxies , and many occur in globular clusters @xcite",
    ".    the rate enhancement of lmxbs in globular clusters may be a critical quantity when estimating the number of ia sne that might be anticipated in these systems @xcite . in the milky way ,",
    "about 1/10 of luminous x - ray binaries are in globular clusters ( typical x - ray luminosities exceeding @xmath2 erg sec@xmath3 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and if one sums the globular clusters by mass @xcite and compares it to the stellar mass for the milky way @xcite , one finds that lmxbs occur about 200 times more commonly than in an equivalent mass of field stars ( the mass fraction in globular clusters is 0.05% based on these resources ) .",
    "a similar enhancement can be determined for early - type galaxies , which are the galaxies considered in our sample .",
    "there is a difference compared to the milky way , because at the distances of even nearby early - type galaxies , the binaries must be significantly more luminous in order to be detectable .",
    "these lmxbs have x - ray luminosities usually exceeding 10@xmath4 @xcite . in these galaxies ,",
    "about half of the x - ray binaries are in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "globular clusters are typically more common in early - type galaxies , relative to the milky way , which can be expressed by the specific frequency of globular clusters , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the specific frequency is 0.5 for the milky way , but is 2.6 for e / s0 in small groups and 5.4 for e / s0 galaxies in virgo and fornax @xcite ; most of the galaxies in the sivakoff sample were in the virgo cluster with the specific frequency in the range 3.5 - 14 . using the data given in the sivakoff sample , for a median @xmath5 = 5 , an order of magnitude greater than the milky way ,",
    "the stellar mass fraction in globular cluster stars is about 0.5% .",
    "for about half of the lmxbs to be in globular clusters , this implies an enhancement rate of about 200 for sources more luminous than @xmath6 erg sec@xmath3 in the 0.3 - 10 kev band .",
    "we conclude that the enhancement rate of producing a lmxb in a globular cluster is about 200 , for x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath2 erg sec@xmath3    if the fraction of sne ia that are hosted by globular clusters was the same as the fraction of lmxbs hosted by globular clusters , we would expect to find about 20 - 50% of sn ia events in globular clusters , which is the proposition that we test here .",
    "the differences between lmxbs and sn ia progenitors are significant in that sn ia events are associated with binaries involving a white dwarf ( or two white dwarfs ) , rather than a neutron star ( or black hole ) plus a non - degenerate star , so the enhancement rate may be very different",
    ". however , the frequency of white dwarf mass - transfer binaries also appears to be enhanced in globular clusters , based on x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "they are fainter than neutron star binaries ( due to the difference in the depth of the potential well ) , but deep observations of nearby galactic globular clusters indicates a large number of hard white dwarf binaries ( cataclysmic variables ) . since globular clusters appear to be factories for the production of mass - transfer binaries , it is only natural to wonder if they might produce a significant fraction of the sne ia seen in early - type galaxies . in this paper",
    "we investigate the frequency with which such nearby sne ia are associated with globular clusters .",
    "we accomplish this by examining the location of these supernovae on _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "images that are sufficiently deep to detect globular cluster in external galaxies . in the next section",
    "we discuss the criteria by which we chose our targets .",
    "the following two sections give a summary of the results and notes on individual objects .",
    "the final section is a discussion of the results and implications for related efforts .",
    "recently , but after our initial presentation of results @xcite , @xcite published a similar effort , which we discuss in more detail in the final section .",
    "in the selection of targets , it is crucial to work with systems that have well - defined positions for the sn .",
    "early - type galaxies , the host sample , often have thousands of globular clusters ( gcs ) so the chance that the sn position will overlap with a random gc ( or background source ) unassociated with the sn becomes significant if the positional uncertainty is @xmath7 ( positional uncertainties were taken from the nasa extragalactic database ) . if there are gcs in the possible region that the sn went off and the error circle is large because of a high positional uncertainty , then the event can at best be considered ambiguous because of the chance of random superposition .",
    "also , the region must have at least two guide stars whose positions are well known so that the hst image can be accurately aligned .",
    "another criteria is that the system has to be close enough that one can detect most of the stars that lie in gcs .",
    "this does not mean that all globular clusters be detected , as the less luminous clusters add little to the total number of globular cluster stars .",
    "for a luminosity function that is log normal , as found for the milky way and m31 , the center of the gaussian is at @xmath8 = @xmath97.5 and with a dispersion of @xmath10 = 1.25 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for these parameters ,",
    "73% of all globular cluster stars are in clusters brighter than @xmath8 = @xmath118 and 93% in clusters brighter than @xmath8 = @xmath97 .",
    "so , if they are brighter than about v = 25 mag , hst can obtain good photometric measurements in modest observing times .",
    "this requirement implies a distance modulus of 32.5 or less , or a distance limit of 32 mpc , which we used as a selection criteria .",
    "ground based images do not have the ability to reach the resolution and magnitude required for galaxies of this distance , making them inadequate for this project .",
    "we note that with sufficient s / n , the extended nature of most gcs will be detected at hst resolution @xcite , subtending @xmath12 in radius .",
    "a third consideration is that the search region of the host galaxy must be suitable for the detection of gcs .",
    "a galaxy with a very high surface brightness will compromise the ability to detect gcs and to determine that they are extended . in practical terms",
    ", one needs to avoid regions where the galaxy surface brightness exceeds 17 magnitudes per square arcsecond , otherwise the s / n of a typical globular cluster ( @xmath13 ) in a typical exposure falls below the detection threshold ( discussed further in section 4 ) . also , the density of gcs increases close to the core approximately like a de vaucouleurs law , so a search region near the core has a much higher chance of superposition and such matches are given as ambiguous detections .",
    "for nearby early - type galaxies , these restrictions mean that there is significant incompleteness for ia sne within about 10 - 20@xmath14 of the galaxy center . unfortunately , this requirement is often at odds with archival hst programs , which generally target the central part of galaxies , although there are a few directed programs to detect particular supernovae .",
    "there were some hst observations to follow the light curve of particular sne , and when there were also pre - sne images ( or 3 + yr post images ) , we could identify the position very accurately and these objects have the smallest error circles , typically 0.3@xmath14 or less ( see below ) .",
    "finally , enough time needs to have passed since the sn ia event so that it is fainter than the globular cluster we are trying to study .",
    "the peak absolute magnitude of a sn ia is about @xmath918 ( in either b , v , or i ) and it has to become fainter than @xmath96 , fading by at least 12 magnitudes .",
    "based on known light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) and extrapolation from the known dimming due to radioactive half lives ( or using the sn 1987a data ) , a dimming of 12 magnitudes occurs in a little less than 3 years in the optical bands .    to sum up",
    ", the important factors governing the selection of targets are :    * positional uncertainty ( @xmath151 arc sec may be ambiguous ) * at least two guide stars in image * galaxy is within 32 mpc * sn ia occurred within suitable location in galaxy : away from high surface brightness regions * the images must have been taken before or at least three years after the sn event occurred .",
    "* the host is an early - type galaxy    with these criteria , we searched all known historical ia sne through 2007 as listed in the iau central bureau for astronomical telegrams , + http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/lists/supernovae.html .",
    "this resulted in the 36 ia sne events listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "of the 36 galaxies that satisfied our target criterion , only 21 had met our observational criteria , including : the sn ia fell within the hst footprint and not in a ccd gap ( this is the primary criteria for excluding 15 events ) ; the observation was taken either before the supernova event at least three years after the event ; astrometric objects are present on the image ; and the supernova position had adequate positional accuracy ( tables 1 , 2 ) . aside from one stis image , where sn 1996x in ngc 5061 was observed in the 50ccd mode ( mirvis spectral element ) , the rest of the images were either from the acs or the wfpc2 ( tables 3 , 5 , 6 ) . for the wfpc2 and stis materials",
    ", we used the data products from the _ hubble legacy archive _ , while for the acs data , we used the standard drizzled image that is one of the data products , available through mast .",
    "see table 3 for exposure times and filters .    to determine whether a sn ia event corresponded to a globular cluster , we needed to align the position of the sn with the hst image by translating and rotating the image so that at least two guide stars matched with positions given in the 2mass survey",
    ". there can be an inaccuracy in the absolute position of an hst image that can lead to improper identifications , so we pursued a few avenues to obtain the best registration of the sn position on the hst image . in a few cases",
    ", there was an hst image in which the sn was visible and another one , usually taken before the sn occurred . in these cases , an alignment to 0.1 - 0.3@xmath14 was achieved , which are our most accurate results ( e.g. , sn 2003hv in ngc 1201 ) .",
    "when two hst images were not available , we had to rely on the accuracy of the optical discovery images , which are often quoted to an accuracy of less than 1@xmath14 . in the discovery images , the positions for some of the sne",
    "are measured relative to the center of the galaxy or to background point sources with known positions .",
    "we checked the accuracy of the galaxy center being used , and when hst images included the galaxy center , we could use this information to position the error circle location .",
    "more often , we performed astrometry corrections to the hst image for the alignment with the optical sn position . for the astrometry",
    ", we used the locations of stars in the field that occur in the 2mass and the usno - b1 catalogue , and the galaxy center , when available .",
    "the size of the resulting error circle is the incoherent sum of the errors from the sne discovery position plus the astrometry uncertainty .",
    "see table 4 for error circle radii .",
    "a source is a non - detection if no point source is found within or on the error circle .",
    "a clear detection would be the result of a single object , detected at above 5@xmath10 , lying within the error circle , with a low probability that this occurs by chance from contaminating sources .",
    "an ambiguous result refers to when either ( 1 ) the source within the error circle is in the 3 - 5@xmath16 range , ( 2 ) there are multiple objects within the error circle , ( 3 ) or when the density of sources is sufficiently high that a object can easily occur within the error circle by chance . with these criteria , in the sample of 21 objects , there were 16 clear non - detections and 5 that were ambiguous .",
    "a more detailed object - by - object discussion is given below .",
    "the limiting magnitudes ( table 4 ) are often dictated by the brightness of the stellar background , which was measured directly from the image local to the sn position .",
    "we calculated the limiting magnitudes by using these backgrounds , along with the exposure time , with the exposure time calculators provided at the hst site .",
    "the median limiting magnitude was 24.4 mag , with a median distance modulus of 31.6 .",
    "we describe each event in our sample , listed chronologically .",

    "the sn has a positional uncertainty ( @xmath191@xmath14 ) , thus our error circle ( 1.8@xmath14 ) encompassed several objects .",

    "not all globular clusters could be detected with the available images due to the depth of the image , which is determined by a combination of the exposure time , filter used , and stellar background , which rises toward the center of the galaxy .",

    ", @xcite also examined the relationship between sne ia and globular clusters .",
    "they included events out to a distance of 100 mpc and performed both a literature search as well as using archival hst data .",
    "they did not restrict their study to early - type galaxies and most of the galaxies in their sample are spirals .",
    "there were 35 sne ia examined , with 18 systems close enough to identify most of the globular clusters .",
    "for the remaining 17 , only the brightest globular clusters would have been visible .",
    "they do not find a globular cluster counterpart to any of the sne ia .",
    "unlike our study , no ambiguous cases are reported .",
    "they present results as a function of galaxy type , so for the early - type galaxies with normal sn ia events , the subsample corresponding to our sample , they have an effective 7.25 objects , and they place an upper limit to the enhancement rate of 46 - 90 ( 90% confidence ) and 82 - 163 ( 99% confidence )",
    ". these results are consistent with ours , although we have a larger sample of sn ia events in early - type galaxies .",
    "our limits on the rate enhancement is much less than that for luminous x - ray binaries ( @xmath47 ) , where the enhancement for globular clusters in early type galaxies is about 200 ( see  1 ) .",
    "if the rate enhancement of 200 also applied to sn ia events , approximately one - third of these supernovae would be associated with globular clusters .",
    "we can compare our results to those from theoretical modeling . in their theoretical stellar evolution modeling of white dwarfs in binary systems ,",
    "@xcite find that globular clusters can produce as many sn ia events as the rest of the galaxy .",
    "for the galaxy and globular cluster parameters chosen , this corresponds to an enhancement rate of about 200 .",
    "@xcite used n - body simulations and found that the double - degenerate channel for sn ia formation would be enhanced in globular clusters by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "@xcite discuss this issue , and based on a variety of calculations , they suggest an enhancement of 10 for the production of sn ia events in globular clusters .",
    "our results are in conflict with a high enhancement rate , such as suggested by @xcite , but are consistent within a rate enhancement of an order of magnitude .",
    "the rate at which sne are associated with globular clusters may depend on radius within the galaxy , which can lead to a bias in our results .",
    "the globular cluster distribution does not necessarily follow the light of the galaxy in the sense that there are relatively fewer globular clusters in the inner region , as is the case in the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 4486 ( m 87 ) , where the core radius for the distribution is 56@xmath14 , compared to 6@xmath14 for the underlying stellar component @xcite .",
    "if the relative deficit of globular clusters in the inner part of early - type galaxies were due to dynamical destruction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a potential sn ia progenitor , originally created in a globular cluster , would appear as part of the underlying stellar distribution .",
    "because the _ hst _ observations exist primarily for the inner 1@xmath48 of the galaxies in our sample , this could lead to an underestimation of the true association rate between globular clusters and sne .    while this might seem like a plausible scenario",
    ", observational tests of globular cluster destruction do not provide support .",
    "destruction mechanisms should act at different rates for low and high mass globular clusters , which should modify the globular cluster luminosity function @xcite .",
    "this would be manifest as a radial change in the luminosity function , but none is seen @xcite .",
    "the other element needed to cause a bias is that globular clusters are destroyed after sn ia progenitors are formed .",
    "however , the typical time since destruction is several gyr while the binary formation mechanism in globular clusters occurs continuously @xcite and on the much shorter relaxation time of 10@xmath49 - 10@xmath50 yr .",
    "we conclude that there is not an obvious central galaxy bias for finding gc - sn associations , but a more definitive statement could be made by accumulating statistics on sn ia events occurring more than 1@xmath48 from the galaxy center , for which there is currently little _",
    "hst _ data .",
    "if globular clusters had proven to be sn ia factories , it would have solved a problem with the production rate of these systems . in his review",
    ", @xcite summarizes the arguments that for sn ia in old populations , the double - degenerate channel is the likely path .",
    "however , the present - day rate for the double - degenerate path in the field stars of early - type galaxies falls an order of magnitude short of the observed rate of sn ia events .",
    "now that we have shown that globular clusters are not responsible for most sn ia events ( barring unforeseen bias effects ) , the difficulty of forming enough of these events persists .",
    "if the enhancement rate for sne ia in globular clusters is about 10 , it should be possible to improve the size of the sample by at least a factor of two and confirm this prediction . within our sample ,",
    "a dozen targets have no image data , and with current instruments on hst , the needed imaging can be accomplished with only modest time investments .",
    "other targets will become available in the near future as the sn ia events fade .",
    "perhaps the most urgent observation is to resolve the tentative association of a supernova with an optical counterpart in ngc 1201 . as this has only a single 160 second exposure ,",
    "substantially improved images can be obtained easily and two - color images would determine the color and morphology of the object . this is a program worth pursuing , because identifying even a single sn ia with a globular cluster gives us the age and metallicity of the progenitor @xcite , information that is otherwise unobtainable .",
    "such information not only gives insight into the formation mechanism of sne ia for old populations , it might help reduce systematics when using sne ia for cosmology .",
