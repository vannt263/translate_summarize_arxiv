    "it should be stressed that our analysis shows that there is serious doubt concerning the conjecture that , in spite of the large values of @xmath55 at low @xmath0 , the conventional three - loop pt predictions for the gls sum rule are reliable ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the proximity of pt predictions in the @xmath27 scheme to predictions obtained in the optimal schemes seems to possess no significance for any process at small momentum transfer and can not be considered a guarantee of rs independence of the results .",
