    "the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) was originally introduced by wigner @xcite in 1951 into physics in order to describe statistics of isolated , high - lying nuclear levels .",
    "a detailed analysis of each state seemed neither possible nor desirable .",
    "statistical properties , on the other hand , were needed for nuclear technology and were well described by the goe .",
    "about a quarter of a century ago there was considerable interest in the so called embedded ensembles and in particular in the two - body random hamiltonian ensemble ( tbre ) @xcite , because it was realized that the goe represented an @xmath6-body interaction in a mean field basis , while it is generally assumed that nuclei can be fairly well described by an effective two - body interaction in this basis .",
    "thus @xmath6-body hamiltonians were constructed from two - body goe s assuming degenerate single - particle states .",
    "the spectral statistics of these two - body random ensembles were analyzed .",
    "the main findings were :    1 .",
    "the level density of the tbre is gaussian @xcite , rather than semi - circular .",
    "the tbre is neither stationary @xcite nor ergodic @xcite .",
    "3 .   unfolding the tbre individually goe statistics is recovered @xcite .",
    "the deviation with respect to goe is due to the variance of average spacings over the ensemble @xcite .",
    "fluctuations at the edge of the spectrum of a tbre are very large @xcite compared to those of a goe and can be roughly described by a brody distribution @xcite of nearest - neighbour spacings with a parameter @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these results , with the exception of the one for the level density , are exclusively numerical .",
    "they were obtained at a time of very limited computer facilities . as a consequence ,",
    "only few particles were treated and the dimension of the tbre matrices was small .",
    "there has been recently a flurry of interest in the tbre regarding properties of wave functions and spectra @xcite - @xcite . in this context",
    "the old work was ignored to a large extent .",
    "yet it seems worthwhile to take it into account , because it is not clear what effects non - ergodicity could have in the new context .",
    "the numerical results can be improved considerably upon and by consequence the old results can be tested .",
    "furthermore it seems desirable to go beyond the tbre to what we may call a realistic two - body random ensemble ( rtbre ) by lifting the degeneracy condition on the single - particle spectrum .",
    "applications in nuclear physics and in other fields certainly require this .    in what follows we",
    "will first fix notation defining the tbre properly and proceed in section 3 to analyze properties in the center of the spectrum . in the fourth section",
    "we consider properties at the edge of the spectrum and we discuss the rtbre which seems to differ mainly there .",
    "conclusions will be given in the last section .",
    "the tbre is defined for a fermionic system of @xmath6 spin @xmath8 particles in three dimensions .",
    "a set of degenerate single - particle states with well defined angular momentum and other quantum numbers is used to construct @xmath6-particle states , that belong to a good total angular momentum @xmath9 , and if we think of a nucleus , also a good isospin @xmath10 . due to the pauli principle and the corresponding blocking of states",
    ", the lowest single - particle states may not enter the picture because we assume them to be filled and inert .",
    "the effective two - body interaction usually used in this context was replaced by a gaussian distributed two - body interaction matrix whose strength is irrelevant as no energy scale is established by degenerate single - particle states .    for our numerical studies",
    "we choose a strength parameter @xmath11 such that the value @xmath12 corresponds to a typical interaction strength in the nuclear @xmath13 shell on which we shall concentrate .",
    "this parameter will be important for the rtbre , where realistic mean field parameters yield the relevant single - particle energies and thus provide an energy scale .",
    "the calculations reported here were mainly carried out for eight particles in the @xmath13 shell .",
    "information about the quantum numbers , dimension of the spectra and the number of matrices of each ensemble used can be found in table [ tabqn ] .",
    "the corresponding shell model calculations were carried out using the code oxbash @xcite .",
    "as far as spectral statistics are concerned we shall mainly consider the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution @xmath14 and the number variance @xmath15 and occasionally the skewness and the excess ; for definitions we refer to a standard book such as mehta @xcite .",
    ".quantum numbers , dimension of the matrices and the number of members for the ensembles analyzed in this paper [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this indicates that the tbre is not ergodic and thus unfolding with the ensemble averaged level density is inappropriate .",
    "we therefore proceed to adjust a polynomial of degree 7 to each spectrum individually and use this individual density for the unfolding procedure .     after each spectrum",
    "is unfolded individually .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the goe .",
    "( b ) number variance @xmath15 for the same case .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves correspond , respectively , to spectral average and ensemble average after re - centering the spectra and normalizing their widths .",
    "the full line is obtained for the goe . ]    figs 2a and 2b show that now @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in good agreement with the goe prediction and figs . 3a and 3b",
    "show a similar agreement     and ( b ) excess @xmath16 for the spectral average of the tbre .",
    "the full line corresponds to the goe . ]    for the skewness and excess .",
    "we should remark that in this case we could increase the energy interval and decrease the degree of the polynomial in order to get the high quality of the result for @xmath15 up to @xmath17 .",
    "we discarded 85 states both at the upper and lower end of the spectra .",
    "these numbers were chosen because omitting fewer states showed significant edge effects while omitting more reduced the range of @xmath18 for which the fluctuations of @xmath15 were acceptable .",
    "we next wish to check whether the variations of the centers and widths of the spectra were alone responsible for the deviations with respect to the goe .",
    "therefore we repeated the calculations with an ensemble unfolding after first re - centering all spectra to the same value or , alternatively , normalizing their width to the same value . the result for the number variance for both procedures",
    "is drawn in fig .",
    "1b . both curves for the number variance represent an improvement but remain very far from goe .",
    "obviously we should apply both corrections , _",
    "i.e. _ both re - center and dilate the spectra such as to correspond to uniform centers and widths before the ensemble unfolding .",
    "the result is such that on the scale of fig . 1b",
    "it is not distinguishable from the goe . the result is therefore plotted in fig .",
    "2b and is comparable to the one obtained by unfolding the individual spectra .    on the average we discarded 105 states at the edges of the spectra and found @xmath19 as the optimum degree for the polynomial in this analysis .",
    "the quality of the energy averaged @xmath15 is only marginally better .",
    "higher moments play a minor role .",
    "we obtained the same result for an ensemble of comparable size and quantum numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "similar agreement was found for @xmath14 , as well as for skewness and excess .",
    "these results seem to indicate that the first and second moments are basically responsible for the non - ergodicity of the tbre , but we have no theoretical argument to support this conjecture , and thus it might not always be true , or break down with higher exactitude .",
    "the above procedure eliminates the large fluctuations in the average density of each spectrum , but it is not totally equivalent to the procedure proposed by french @xcite . in the original paper",
    "the correction he calculated was given for the distribution of widths of @xmath6-th neighbour spacings as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "we translated the correction to one for @xmath15 ( see equations ( 5.3 ) and ( 6.3 ) of reference @xcite ) that reads as @xmath22 \\frac{\\sigma^2}{d^2 } } { 1 - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{d^2 } } % \\sigma^2_e(l ) - \\left [   % \\sigma^2_s(l ) - \\frac{1}{6 } + l^2 % \\right ] \\frac{\\sigma^2}{d^2 } \\ ; , \\label{eqfre}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the ensemble and spectral ( energy ) averaged number variance at distance @xmath18 and @xmath25 denotes the ensemble variance of the spectrally averaged mean level distance @xmath26 .",
    "4 shows @xmath24 as calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eqfre ] ) using the numerical data for @xmath23 .    ) as described in the text ( dashed line ) in comparison with the goe ( full line ) . ]",
    "note that this correction is applied after re - centering the spectra .",
    "this is not explicit in the original paper , but it is the only reasonable way to interpret the basic argument given there .",
    "indeed , application of the formula to non re - centred spectra gives unreasonable results .    for correlations up to about @xmath18=5 and",
    "certainly for the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution the correction works quite well ; at larger distances discrepancies become large , as is to be expected if the aim is to simulate the adjustment of the width of a near gaussian .",
    "the larger the spectra the larger the range on which we expect the correction to work well . in earlier calculations with smaller ensembles",
    "the number variance was not considered at large distances , and thus the deviation could not be detected .",
    "the spectral properties of the rtbre at the center are also found to be of goe type up to some energy range which depends on the subspace defined by the quantum numbers we consider and on the interaction strength .",
    "the fluctuations at the edge of the spectra are of interest because of the comparison with low - lying nuclear states @xcite , and in the context of recent work on the angular momentum dependence of ground states @xcite .",
    "the quantity to consider is the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution .",
    "the old results are fitted with a brody distributions @xcite with parameters around @xmath27 .",
    "recent studies have suggest the use of semi - poisson distributions @xcite , that might be relevant as we are interested in the edge of the spectra .",
    "these distributions have been discussed in relation with triangles with irrational relations between angles @xcite , where the coincidence is spotty .",
    "we shall keep this additional option in mind to expand on the old discussions .    the simplest way to proceed",
    "is to take all spacings between the first and the second level and normalize them to average 1 ( for improved statistics we shall use the corresponding spacings at the upper end of the spectrum also , without mentioning it explicitly each time ) .    ) .",
    "the dashed - dotted line corresponds to the semi - poisson and the dashed line to the best brody fit .",
    "( b ) the same as in ( a ) for the quantum numbers ( @xmath28 ) ]    in fig .",
    "5 we show the spacing distribution obtained in this way , and we find amazingly large spacings up to 8 in the case @xmath29 and up to 6 for the ensemble with quantum numbers @xmath28 . note that the same procedure performed on a goe of the same size leads to a spacing distribution very similar to that at the center of the spectrum .",
    "the semi - poisson distribution does not yield a very convincing fit , but is not worse than the usual brody distribution , despite of the fact that the latter has one free parameter .",
    "normalizing the distances to @xmath30 might seem too nave .",
    "although the polynomial unfolding of the integrated spectrum delivered good results for the analysis of the central region it is not useful at the edges .",
    "therefore we proceed to use a gaussian to unfold each spectrum individually adjusting its parameters .",
    "this procedure has some merit ; a gaussian is the exact result for the ensemble with infinite dimension , though the fact that we have already re - confirmed the non - ergodicity of the tbre casts some doubt on its application to individual spectra .        in fig .",
    "6 we show the spacing distribution between the first and the second states for @xmath29 and @xmath28 unfolded in this way .",
    "the extremely large spacings have disappeared though the result still differs markedly from a goe .",
    "the confidence levels , discussed in @xcite for a brody fit , rely heavily on binning the small intensities in the tail in one large bin and are therefore somewhat arbitrary .",
    "in particular , a few large spacings would not invalidate the fit .",
    "the analysis of the ensemble for @xmath31 delivered qualitatively the same result and they agree substantially with the old results . the semi - poisson distribution drawn in the same picture",
    "gives a surprisingly good fit in fig .",
    "6b and is somewhat worse in fig .",
    "note though that the discrepancies again are considerably smaller for the longer spectrum and are not larger for the shorter one than for the brody distribution with an adjusted parameter .",
    "yet we may ask if the gaussian unfolding is really that meaningful . in this context",
    "two questions arise : first , is the procedure stable ? and second , does it relate to the only experimental data we have ? while the latter point will be discussed later , the former may be considered by using a gaussian multiplied by a polynomial for unfolding",
    ". we may then ask if we find any plateau of the result as a function of the degree of the polynomial .",
    "we considered the brody parameter as a function of the degree of the polynomial and we find that for the short spectrum a polynomial up to degree 2 and for the longer one a polynomial up to degree 4 can be added without a significant change of the brody parameter .",
    "this , combined with the theoretical expectation of a gaussian in the limit of large matrices , gives us some confidence to use the unfolding mentioned and should encourage further analysis as to the significance of the agreement found with a semi - poisson distribution .",
    "we next look at the comparison with the nuclear physics results of ref .",
    "note that here the normalization of the spacings is made as a function of mass number and angular momentum , but in no way is the spectral density further up in the spectrum involved .",
    "we therefore conclude that only a comparison with the simply normalized spacings shown in fig .",
    "5 is legitimate .",
    "yet these data have a very long tail that seems incompatible with the nuclear data . as we discarded a more sophisticated unfolding",
    ", we have to fall back on an alternative option .",
    "obviously the assumption of degenerate single - particle levels is not fulfilled in the nuclear case .",
    "it therefore seems justified to consider realistic splitting of the single - particle levels combined with a realistic interaction strength , i.e. the rtbre . in this case",
    "we must limit ourselves to the spacings at the bottom of the spectrum , as symmetry is destroyed by the single - particle energies .",
    "note that the results we now obtain are dependent on the shell splitting and by no means universal . yet",
    "if we compare these results in fig . 7 with the experimental ones we see less discrepancies .    .",
    "the dashed - dotted line corresponds to the semi - poisson and the dashed curve to the best brody fit . ]",
    "as the nuclear data have poor statistics the agreement is not very meaningful , but at least the few large spacings are consistent and the general shape seems correct . fits with a brody distribution fails in this case and the agreement with a semi - poisson distribution is similarly poor .",
    "comparison with the unfolded tbre for the smaller sample , on the other hand would give a better fit , but has no real foundation .",
    "we may conclude that the phenomenology observed in earlier papers for the tbre is essentially correct when viewed with larger spectra .",
    "the correction formula proposed in @xcite will only correct short - range behaviour if we re - center the spectra previously .",
    "we found that re - centering spectra and normalizing their widths would remove the non - ergodicity at the center of the spectrum to a large extent .",
    "note though , that this non - ergodicity is not really a problem at least if we consider the center of the spectra , because in practice we have to unfold each nuclear , atomic , resonance cavity or whatever spectrum individually , anyway . at the center of the spectrum the fluctuation properties of the rtbre",
    "coincide with those of the tbre on the range determined by the strength of the interaction .",
    "as far as edge effects are concerned , the situation changes .",
    "spectral properties with realistic splitting of single - particle levels differ significantly from those of the tbre .",
    "the rtbre seems to be in better agreement with the nuclear data , but no doubt a new compilation of such data is desirable because the small sample does not allow a detailed comparison .",
    "the unfolding procedures at the edge of the spectrum are quite sensitive , but we have found unfolding with a gaussian to be quite satisfactory both because of its theoretical background and because of its stability .",
    "we certainly confirm earlier findings of large fluctuations , and with the gaussian unfolding we found very reasonable agreement with a semi - poisson distribution for the longest spectrum we have .",
    "we may conclude that future attention should be concentrated on two points : first we should look out for possible effects of the non - ergodicity on wave function properties , and second we should investigate the possible significance of the semi - poisson distribution at the edge of spectra .",
