    "one of classical problems in astronomy and physics is the three - body problem in the newtonian gravity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational three - body problem is not integrable by the analytical method .",
    "as particular solutions , however , euler and lagrange found a collinear solution and an equilateral triangular one , respectively .",
    "the solutions for the restricted three - body problem , where one of three bodies is a test mass , are known as lagrange points @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "_ lagrange s equilateral triangular solution _ has also a practical importance , since it is stable for some cases .",
    "lagrange points @xmath2 and @xmath1 for the sun - jupiter system are stable and indeed the trojan asteroids are located there . for the sun - earth system , asteroids were also found around @xmath2 by the recent observations @xcite .",
    "recently , lagrange points have attracted renewed interests for relativistic astrophysics @xcite , where they have discussed the relativistic corrections for lagrange points @xcite , and the gravitational radiation reaction on @xmath2 and @xmath1 analytically @xcite and by numerical methods @xcite .",
    "it is currently important to reexamine lagrange points in the framework of general relativity . as a pioneering work ,",
    "it was pointed out by nordtvedt that the location of the triangular points is very sensitive to the ratio of the gravitational mass to the inertial one @xcite .",
    "along this course , it might be important as a gravity experiment to discuss the three - body coupling terms in the post - newtonian ( pn ) force , because some of the terms are proportional to a product of three masses as @xmath3 .",
    "such a triple product can appear only for relativistic three ( or more ) body systems but can not for a relativistic compact binary nor a newtonian three - body system .",
    "it was shown by ichita et al .",
    ", including the present authors , that a relativistic equilateral triangular solution does not satisfy the equation of motion at the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) order except for two cases @xcite ; ( 1 ) three finite masses are equal and ( 2 ) one mass is finite and the other two are zero .",
    "hence , it is interesting to investigate what happens at the 1pn level for three unequal finite masses in lagrange s equilibrium configuration . for the restricted three - body problem ,",
    "on the other hand , krefetz found a relativistic triangular solution by adding the corrections to the position of the third body @xcite .",
    "for three general finite masses , we shall look for a relativistic equilibrium solution that corresponds to lagrange s equilateral triangular one .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we take the units of @xmath4 .",
    "first , we consider the newtonian gravity among three masses denoted as @xmath5 @xmath6 in a circular motion . the location of each mass is written as @xmath7 , where we choose the origin of the coordinates as the common center of mass , so that @xmath8 we start by seeing whether the newtonian equation of motion for each body can be satisfied if the configuration is an equilateral triangle .",
    "let us put @xmath9 , where we define the relative position between masses as @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "then , the equation of motion for each mass becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the total mass @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that each body moves around the common center of mass with the same orbital period .",
    "figure [ fig - tri - all ] shows a triangular configuration for general masses .",
    "( [ n - eom ] ) gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the newtonian angular velocity .",
    "the orbital radius @xmath18 of each body with respect to the common center of mass is obtained as @xcite @xmath19 where we define the mass ratio as @xmath20 .",
    "for the restricted three - body problem , an inequilateral triangular solution was investigated @xcite .",
    "hence , for three finite masses , we study a pn triangular configuration .",
    "let us denote each side length of a pn triangle as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the non - dimensional correction at the 1pn order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - tri - all ] ) . here , if all the three corrections are equal ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , a pn configuration is still an equilateral triangle , though each side length is changed by a scale transformation as @xmath41 .",
    "namely , one of the degrees of freedom for ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) corresponds to a scale transformation , and this is unphysical . in other words ,",
    "we take account of only the corrections which keep the size of the system but change its shape . for its simplicity , we adopt the arithmetic mean of three side lengths in order to characterize the size of the system as @xmath45 , \\label{add}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see appendix [ length ] for possible choices of fixing the unphysical degree of freedom ) .",
    "this arithmetic mean of the pn triangle is chosen to be the same as a side length of the newtonian equilateral triangle as @xmath46 = a , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the degree of freedom for a scale transformation can be fixed .",
    "otherwise , a degree of freedom for a scale transformation would remain so that an ambiguity due to the similarity could enter our results .",
    "thus , we obtain a constraint on ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) as @xmath47 hence , we look for the remaining two conditions for determining ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) in the following .      furthermore , @xmath53 and @xmath54 also have pn corrections . however , these corrections multiplied by @xmath42 ( or @xmath44 ) make 2pn ( or higher order ) contributions in eq .",
    "( [ m1-eom - c ] ) and hence they can be neglected .",
    "also in @xmath29 , 1pn corrections to @xmath53 and @xmath54 lead to 2pn , since they are multiplied by 1pn term as @xmath55 .",
    "we obtain the equation of motion for @xmath35 and @xmath36 by cyclic manipulations as @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we obtain the expressions for ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) as @xmath60 , \\label{d12 } \\\\",
    "\\varepsilon_{23 } & = \\frac{1}{24 } \\frac{m}{a } [ ( \\nu_3 - \\nu_1)(5 - 3\\nu_2 ) - ( \\nu_1 - \\nu_2)(5 - 3\\nu_3 ) ] , \\label{d23 } \\\\",

    "substituting eqs .",

    "\\label{omega - pn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using @xmath63 , one can immediately show @xmath64 , so that we find @xmath65 for the same masses and @xmath66 .",
    "in other words , for the same masses and angular velocity , the pn triangular configuration is always smaller than the newtonian one .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the relativistic corrections of the distance between each body for lagrange point @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) of solar system .",
    "here we choose @xmath27 and @xmath35 as the sun and each planet , respectively . in the case of the restricted three - body problem ( @xmath67 ) , it is convenient to use eqs .",
    "( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) rather than eqs .",
    "( [ d12 ] ) - ( [ d31 ] ) , because it is natural to change not @xmath68 but location of @xmath36 .",
    "( [ condition2 ] ) implies that the correction of distance between each planet and lagrange point @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) is approximately @xmath69 of schwarzschild radius of the sun .",
    "hence , we obtain the same values of this correction for earth and jupiter .",
    "the similar corrections are mentioned also in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "the above pn effects , however , are so tiny that they could be neglected in the near - future measurements @xcite .    it is interesting to extend this 1pn work to higher pn orders for the gravitational wave physics ( see @xcite for the equation of motion and compact binaries ) .",
    "we reexamined the post - newtonian effects on lagrange s equilateral triangular solution for three - body problem . for three finite masses",
    ", it was found that a general triangular configuration satisfies the post - newtonian equation of motion in general relativity , if and only if it has the relativistic corrections to each side length .",
    "it was shown also that the post - newtonian triangular configuration is always smaller than the newtonian one for the same masses and angular velocity . studying the correction to stability of this configuration",
    "is left as future work .",
    "this work was supported in part ( k. y. ) by japan society for the promotion of science , grant - in - aid for jsps fellows , no .",
    "in stead of the arithmetic mean of the three side lengths , one might wish to use the geometric mean of them or the triangular area . hence , let us mention briefly these cases .",
    "the geometric mean of three side lengths by eq .",
    "( [ ep ] ) is written up to the 1pn order as @xmath70 + \\mathrm{o}(\\varepsilon^2 ) , \\label{mul}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 denotes the second order of ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , namely at the 2pn order .",
    "this expression is identical with the arithmetic mean by eq .",
    "( [ add ] ) .",
    "in addition , we can obtain the condition that these means are equal to a side length of the newtonian equilateral triangle as @xmath72    next , we consider a pn triangular area . a triangular area @xmath73 is given by heron s formula as @xmath74 where @xmath75 hence , substitution of eq .
