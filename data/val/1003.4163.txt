    "this procedure requires an explicit expression for the action functional which , in turn , is given by the series of all 2pi ` vacuum ' , i.e. , external - leg - less diagrams which can be written down for a given microscopic model .    strong correlations in general require non - perturbative approximations . for the 2pi",
