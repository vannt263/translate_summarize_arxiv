    "quantum graphs became an immensely popular subject in the last two decades not only because of their numerous practical applications @xcite , but also because they are a good laboratory to study properties of quantum systems .",
    "the core of the appeal is that they exhibit mixed dimensional properties being locally one - dimensional , as long as a single edge is concerned , but globally multidimensional of many different types .    a class which attracted a particular attention are the tree graphs .",
    "an important question concerns free propagation of a particle on such graphs , i.e. the absolutely continuous spectrum of the corresponding tree hamiltonians .",
    "it is known , for instance , that the _ ac _ spectral component can survive a weak disorder coming from edge length variation  cf .",
    "ref .   and references therein . on the other hand , it was demonstrated recently by breuer and frank @xcite that the spectrum on radial _ sparse _ graphs in which a subsequence of edge lengths tends to infinity is purely singular .",
    "the last named result was derived for the simplest vertex coupling usually called kirchhoff . in this paper",
    "we address ourselves the question how does the propagation on a radial tree graph depend on coupling at the vertices .",
    "the family we consider is large : out of the @xmath4 parameters admissible at a tree vertex with the branching number @xmath0 by the self - adjointness requirement we will discuss a @xmath5$]-parameter subset .",
    "we will demonstrate that for a large part of it the result of breuer and frank is preserved , however , there are cases of vertex couplings for which the spectrum of the corresponding hamiltonian has an absolutely continuous component or even it is purely absolutely continuous .",
    "the method we are going to use is based on the seminal observation of solomyak and coauthors  cf .",
    "references therein and developments in the subsequent work @xcite  which makes it possible to reduce the problem to study of a family of schrdinger operators on halfline , in our case with suitable generalized point interactions .",
    "what is important is that of all the vertex coupling parameters all but four will show up only at the boundary condition at the halfline endpoint . in analogy with ref .",
    "we will combine such a decomposition with an appropriate modification of a theorem by remling @xcite . as a preliminary we will summarize in the next three sections needed facts about schrdinger operators on metric trees and parametrizations of generalized point interactions . in sec .",
    "5 we will then derive the decomposition mentioned above and in sec .",
    "6 we modify remling s theorem for our purposes , and in the final section we combine these results to state and prove our claims .",
    "basic notions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics on graphs are nowadays well know so we can recall them only very briefly making reference , e.g. , to ref .",
    "and an extensive bibliography in the proceedings volume @xcite . given a metric graph @xmath6 we use @xmath7 as the state hilbert space .",
    "the hamiltonian acts as a one - dimensional schrdinger operator on each edge ; in the particular case when there is no potential it is simply @xmath8 on the @xmath9-th edge . to make this operator self - adjoint suitable coupling conditions have to be imposed at the vertices .",
    "the simplest one are _",
    "free _ conditions ( often also called kirchhoff ) which require function continuity at the vertex together with vanishing sum of the derivatives . below we will introduce a wide family of other coupling conditions we are going to consider in this paper .    by a seminal observation of sobolev and solomyak  @xcite a  schrdinger operator on a  homogeneous rooted tree graph with free coupling conditions at the vertices is unitarily equivalent to the orthogonal sum of operators acting on @xmath10 , namely one - dimensional schrdinger operators with appropriate singular interactions .",
    "we are going to discuss how this result generalizes to a  larger class of coupling conditions , branching numbers , and different lengths of the edges under the assumption that the potential @xmath11 is real , bounded and measurable depending on the distance from the root @xmath12 only .",
    "this equivalence will be subsequently our main technical tool to demonstrate claims about absolutely continuous spectrum of schrdinger operators on such trees .",
    "speaking about tree graphs , we will use a notation similar to that of ref .  .",

    "we say that the vertex @xmath16 of a  tree graph @xmath6 belongs to the @xmath19-th generation if there are just @xmath20 vertices on the shortest path between @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",

    "in general , admissible couplings at a vertex @xmath16 can be characterized by @xmath55 real parameters , or equivalently , by a unitary @xmath56\\times [ ( b_k+1)]$ ] matrix @xcite . in order to construct the unitary equivalence with halfline problems mentioned above",
    ", we have to restrict our consideration to a  @xmath57$]-parameter subset by adopting the assumption that all the emanating edges are equivalent .",
    "moreover , the unitary equivalence requires the parameters of the coupling to be equal for all the vertices of the same generation .",
