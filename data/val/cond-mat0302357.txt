    "recently a new strategy for performing measurements on solid state ( josephson ) qubits was proposed which uses the entanglement of the qubit with states of a damped oscillator  @xcite , with this oscillator representing the plasma resonance of the josephson junction .",
    "this system of a spin coupled to a damped harmonic oscillator ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] ) can be mapped to a standard model for dissipative quantum systems , namely the spin - boson model  @xcite .    .",
    "]    here the spectral function governing the dynamics of the spin has a resonance peak .",
    "such structured baths were also discussed in connection with electron transfer processes  @xcite .",
    "we use the flow equation method introduced by wegner  @xcite to analyze the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , consisting of a two - level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator @xmath0 , which is coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators : @xmath1 with the spectral function @xmath2 . this system can be mapped to a spin - boson model  @xcite @xmath3 where the dynamics of the spin depends only on the spectral function @xmath4 given by @xmath5",
    "using the flow equation technique we approximately diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath6 [ eq.([eq : spin_boson ] ) ] by means of infinitesimal unitary transformations . the continuous sequence of unitary transformations @xmath7 is labelled by a flow parameter @xmath8 .",
    "applying such a transformation to a given hamiltonian , this hamiltonian becomes a function of @xmath8 : @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the initial hamiltonian and @xmath11 is the final diagonal hamiltonian .",
    "usually it is more convenient to work with a differential formulation @xmath12\\quad\\textrm{with}\\quad \\eta(l)=\\frac{du(l)}{dl}u^{-1}(l).\\ ] ] using the flow equation approach one can decouple system and bath by diagonalizing @xmath13  @xcite : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the renormalized tunneling frequency . for the generator of the flow",
    "we choose the ansatz  @xcite : @xmath16 @xmath17 the flow equations for the effective hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : effective_h ] ) ]",
    "then take the following form : @xmath18 the unitary flow diagonalizing the hamiltonian generates a flow for @xmath19 which takes the structure @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 obey the differential equations @xmath23 one can show that the function @xmath21 decays to zero as @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the observable @xmath25 decays completely into bath operators  @xcite .",
    "we integrated the flow equations numerically in order to calculate the fourier transform , @xmath26 , of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath27 @xmath28 can be used to calculate dephasing and relaxation times for measurements on qubits  @xcite .",

    ". additional structure of @xmath30 due to higher order transitions in the term scheme is not seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : j+c ] .",
    "this is due to our ansatz for @xmath19 [ see eq.([eq : sigma_z ] ) ] , which does not include the corresponding higher order terms .",
