    "the behaviour and properties of atoms in strong magnetic fields is a subject of increasing interest .",
    "this is motivated by the astrophysical discovery of strong fields on white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the competition of the diamagnetic and coulomb interaction causes a rich variety of complex properties which are , of course , also of interest on their own .    for a long time the investigations in the literature focused on the hydrogen atom ( for a list of references",
    "see , for example , @xcite ) . as a result of the corresponding investigations",
    "the absorption features of certain magnetic white dwarfs could be understood in detail and a modelling of their atmospheres was possible ( see ref.@xcite for a review up to 1994 and @xcite for more recent references ) .",
    "detailed spectroscopic calculations were carried out recently for the helium atom in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these calculations allow to identify spectra of other , namely helium - rich objects , including the prominent white dwarf gd229 @xcite .",
    "recently a number of new magnetic white dwarfs have been found whose spectra are still unexplained ( see , e.g. , reimers et al @xcite in the course of the hamburg eso survey ) .",
    "investigations on the electronic structure in the presence of a magnetic field appear to be quite complicated due to the intricate geometry of this quantum problem . for the hydrogen atom",
    "the impact of the competing coulomb and diamagnetic interaction is particularly evident and pronounced in the intermediate regime for which the magnetic and coulomb forces are comparable . for different electronic degrees of excitation of the atom the intermediate regime is met for different absolute values of the field strength . for the ground state this regime corresponds to field strengths around @xmath16 ( for the magnetic field strength as well as for other physical values we use atomic units and , in particular , @xmath17",
    ", @xmath18 corresponds to the magnetic field strength @xmath19 t ) .",
    "both early @xcite and more recent works @xcite on the hydrogen atom have used different approaches for relatively weak fields ( the coulomb force prevails over the magnetic force ) and for very strong fields ( the coulomb force can be considered as weak in comparison with the magnetic forces which is the so - called adiabatic regime ) . a powerful method to obtain comprehensive results on low - lying energy levels of the hydrogen atom in particular in the intermediate regime is provided by mesh methods @xcite . for atoms with several electrons",
    "there are two decisive factors which enrich the possible changes in the electronic structure with varying field strength compared to the one - electron system .",
    "first we have a third competing interaction which is the electron - electron repulsion and second the different electrons feel very different coulomb forces , i.e. possess different one particle energies , and consequently the regime of the intermediate field strengths appears to be the sum of the intermediate regimes for the separate electrons .",
    "opposite to the hydrogen atom the wavefunctions of the multi - electron atoms change their symmetries with increasing field strength .",
    "it is well known that the singlet zero - field ground state of the helium atom ( @xmath20 in the hartree - fock language ) is replaced in the high - field regime by the triplet fully spin polarised configuration @xmath21 . for atoms with more than two electrons",
    "the evolution of the ground state within the whole range of field strengths @xmath22 includes multiple intermediate configurations besides the zero - field ground state and the ground state corresponding to the high field limit . in view of the above",
    "there is a need for further quantum mechanical investigations and data on atoms with more than two electrons in order to understand their electronic structure in strong magnetic fields .",
    "our calculations allowed us to obtain the first conclusive results on the series of ground state configurations for the li @xcite and c @xcite atoms .",
    "these results are substantially different from previously published ones @xcite .",
    "the ground state electronic configurations of the beryllium atom for @xmath22 were not investigated so far . a previous work on the beryllium atom @xcite focused on problems associated with the symmetries of the hartree - fock wavefunction of the low - field ground state @xmath23 of this atom . for strong fields the @xmath23 state represents a highly excited state and the electronic ground state configuration of be is , so far , not investigated .    in the current paper we present results of our fully numerical 2d hartree - fock mesh calculations of the beryllium atom and @xmath10 ion in magnetic fields and",
    "obtain for the first time conclusive results on the structure and energy of the ground state configurations of these systems for arbitrary field strengths .",
    "the computational method applied in the current work coincides with the method described in our works @xcite and applied afterwards in @xcite . we solve the electronic schrdinger equation for the beryllium atom in a magnetic field under the assumption of an infinitely heavy nucleus in the ( unrestricted ) hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "the solution is established in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath24 with the @xmath25-axis oriented along the magnetic field .",
    "we prescribe to each electron a definite value of the magnetic quantum number @xmath26 .",
    "each one - electron wave function @xmath27 depends on the variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates the numbering of the electrons .",
    "the resulting partial differential equations for @xmath32 and the formulae for the coulomb and exchange potentials have been presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "these equations as well as the poisson equations for inter - electronic coulomb and exchange potentials are solved by means of the fully numerical mesh method described in refs .",
    "the finite - difference solution of the poisson equations on sets of nodes coinciding with those of the hartree - fock equations turns out to be possible due to a special form of uniform meshes used in the present calculations and in refs.@xcite .",
    "details and discussion on these meshes are presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "our mesh approach is flexible enough to yield precise results for arbitrary field strengths .",
    "some minor decrease of the precision appears for electronic configurations with big differences in the spatial distribution of the electronic density for different electrons .",
    "this results in big differences with respect to the spatial extension of the density distribution for different electrons .",
    "this situation is more typical for the electronic configurations which do not represent the ground state at the corresponding fields ( e.g. @xmath23 at very strong fields or @xmath8 in the weak field regime ) .",
    "the precision of our results depends , of course , on the number of mesh nodes and can be always improved in calculations with denser meshes .",
    "most of the present calculations are carried out on sequences of meshes with the maximal number of nodes being @xmath33 .",
    "along with the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation the key element for solving the problem of the ground state electronic configurations is a proper choice of the configurations , which could potentially be the ground state ones .",
    "an example of solving this problem is presented in @xcite . in that work",
    "we have developed a strategy which enables one to reduce the set of possible ground state configurations which are then subject to a following numerical investigation .",
    "this removes the risk of missing some ground state configurations due to the limited possibilities of performing numerical investigations . with increasing number of electrons the number of configurations which can",
    "not a priori be excluded from becoming the ground state increase rapidly .",
    "a comprehensive numerical investigation of all these configurations is , in general , not feasible .",
    "the above - mentioned strategy to exclude certain configurations is therefore highly desirable .",
    "it is based on a combination of qualitative theoretical arguments and numerical calculations of the energies of electronic configurations . as a first step the set of electronic configurations has to be separated into several groups according to their spin projections @xmath34 .",
    "the following considerations have to be carried out in each subset separately , and are certainly more transparent by starting with the limit of infinite strong fields and analysing the electronic configurations with decreasing field strengths .",
    "the qualitative theoretical considerations mentioned above are based on the geometry of the spatial part of the wavefunction and enable one to determine the ground state for the high - field limit as well as several candidates for the ground state configuration with decreasing field strength .",
    "the numerical calculations then enable us to decide which of these candidates becomes the actual first intermediate ground state and yields the transition field strength .",
    "the knowledge of the first intermediate ground state allows us to repeat the qualitative considerations for the second intermediate ground state to obtain a list of candidates which is then investigated by means of numerical calculations .",
    "repeating this procedure one can determine the full sequence of the ground state configurations for each subset @xmath34 and finally the sequence of ground state configurations for the physical system .",
    "in this section we provide some helpful qualitative considerations on the problem of the atomic multi - electron ground states particularly in the limit of strong magnetic fields .",
    "for the case @xmath35 the ground state configuration of the beryllium atom can be characterised as @xmath37 .",
    "this notation has a literal meaning when considering the atom in the framework of the restricted hartree - fock approach .",
    "the latter is an approximation of limited quality in describing the beryllium atom as it was shown in many fully correlated calculations both for the field - free be atom @xcite and for its polarizabilities in electric fields @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in these works that the be atom is a strongly correlated system and that the hf ground state wavefunction ( i. e. the spherically symmetric @xmath37 ) is not a very accurate zeroth - order wavefunction , especially for calculations of electric polarizabilities .",
    "this is due to a significant contribution of the @xmath38 configuration to the ground state wave function .",
    "the latter configuration is evidently a non - spherical one .",
    "this fact is in agreement with results of ref .",
    "@xcite where the fully numerical 2d unrestricted hartree - fock approach provides the @xmath39 shell stretched along the @xmath25 axis even for @xmath35 . in terms of spherical functions",
    "it is natural to describe this geometry of the @xmath39 shell as a mixture of @xmath40 and @xmath41 functions .",
    "we remark that the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 orbital notation both for @xmath35 and @xmath45 is based on the behaviour of the wave functions in the vicinity of the origin and on the topology of the nodal surfaces , but does not imply any detailed geometry or certain values of the orbital moment @xmath46 .",
    "it is evident that the field - free ground state of the beryllium atom remains the ground state only for relatively weak fields .",
    "the set of one - electron wave functions constituting the hf ground state for the opposite case of extremely strong magnetic fields can be determined as follows .",
    "the nuclear attraction energies and hf potentials ( which determine the motion along @xmath25 axis ) are small for large @xmath47 in comparison to the interaction energies with the magnetic field ( which determines the motion perpendicular to the magnetic field and is responsible for the landau zonal structure of the spectrum ) .",
    "thus , all the one - electron wavefunctions must correspond to the lowest landau zones , i.e. the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath26 are not postive for all the electrons @xmath48 , and the system must be fully spin - polarised , i.e. @xmath49 . for the coulomb central field the one - electron levels form ( as @xmath50 ) quasi 1d coulomb series with the binding energy @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number of nodal surfaces of the wave function with respect to the @xmath25 axis .",
    "the binding energy of a separate electron has the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the energy of the electron .",
    "when considering the case @xmath58 it is evident , that the wave functions with @xmath54 have to be chosen for the ground state configuration . furthermore starting with the energetically lowest one particle level",
    "the electrons occupy according to the above arguments orbitals with increasing absolute value of the magnetic quantum number @xmath59 .",
    "consequently the ground state of the beryllium atom must be given by the fully spin - polarised configuration @xmath8 . in our notation of the electronic configurations we assume in the following that all paired electrons , like for example the @xmath20 part of a configuration , are of course in a spin up and spin down orbital , respectively , whereas all unpaired electrons possess a negative projection of the spin onto the magnetic field direction .",
    "on a qualitative level the configuration @xmath8 is not very different from similar electronic configurations for other atoms ( see ref .",
    "this is a manifestation of the simplification of the picture of atomic properties in the limit @xmath36 where a linear sequence of electronic configurations replaces the periodic table of elements of the field - free case .",
    "the problem of the configurations of the ground state for the intermediate field region can not be solved without doing explicit calculations combined with some qualitative considerations in order to extract the relevant configurations .",
    "in order to determine the ground state electronic configurations of the beryllium atom we employ here the strategy introduced in ref.@xcite where the carbon atom has been investigated .",
    "first of all , we divide the possible ground state configurations into three groups according to their total spin projection @xmath34 : the @xmath3 group ( low - field ground state configurations ) , the intermediate group @xmath4 and the @xmath7 group ( the high - field ground state configurations ) . this grouping is required for the following qualitative considerations which are based on the geometry of the spatial parts of the one - electron wave functions .",
    "in the course of this discussion it is expedient to treat _ local _ ground states for each @xmath34 subset ( i.e. the lowest states with a certain @xmath34 value ) along with the _ global _ ground state of the atom as a whole . for each value of the magnetic field strength one of these local ground states is the global ground state of the atom .    according to the general arguments presented in the previous section we know that the ground state configuration of the beryllium atom in the high field limit must be the fully spin - polarised state @xmath8 .",
    "the question of the ground state configurations at intermediate fields can not be solved without performing explicit electronic structure calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the a priori set of possible intermediate ground state configurations increases enormously with increasing number of electrons and is rather large already for the beryllium atom .",
    "some qualitative considerations are therefore needed in order to exclude certain configurations as possible ground state configurations thereby reducing the number of candidates for which explicit calculations have to be performed . as mentioned in the previous section the optimal strategy hereby consists of the repeated procedure of determining neighbouring ground state configurations with increasing ( or decreasing ) magnetic field strength using both qualitative arguments as well as the results of the calculations for concrete configurations .",
    "the total energies for the considered states and particularly of those states which become the global ground state of the atom for some regime of the field strength are illustrated in figure 1 . in the following paragraphs",
    "we describe our sequence of selection procedure and calculations for the candidates of the electronic ground state configurations .    due to the simplicity of the ground state electronic configurations of atoms in the limit @xmath36",
    "it is natural to start the consideration for @xmath60 with the high - field ground state and then consider other possible candidates in question for the electronic ground state for @xmath7 ( see figure 1 ) _ with decreasing field strength_. the consideration of the high - field ( i.e. the fully spin - polarised ) regime was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite and for this case ( i.e. @xmath7 for beryllium ) we repeat this consideration in more detail .",
    "in particular , we have found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the beryllium atom , opposite to the carbon and heavier elements has only one fully spin - polarised ground state configuration .",
    "all the one electron wave functions of the high - field ground state @xmath8 possess no nodal surfaces crossing the @xmath25-axis and occupy the energetically lowest orbitals with magnetic quantum numbers ranging from @xmath61 down to @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 orbital possesses the smallest binding energy of all orbitals constituting the high - field ground state .",
    "its binding energy decreases rapidly with decreasing field strength .",
    "thus , we can expect that the first crossover of ground state configurations happens due to a change of the @xmath63 orbital into one possessing a higher binding energy at the corresponding lowered field strength .",
    "one may think that the first transition while decreasing the magnetic field strength will involve a transition from an orbital possessing @xmath54 to one for @xmath64 .",
    "the energetically lowest available one particle state with @xmath64 is the @xmath41 orbital .",
    "another possible orbital into which the @xmath63 wave function could evolve is the @xmath40 state .",
    "for the hydrogen atom or hydrogen - like ions in a magnetic field the @xmath65 is stronger bound than the @xmath40 orbital . on the other hand , owing to the electron screening in multi - electron atoms in field - free space the @xmath40 orbital tends to be more tightly bound than the @xmath41 orbital .",
    "thus , two states i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath67 are candidates for becoming the ground state in the @xmath7 set when we lower the field strength coming from the high field situation .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the first crossover of the @xmath7 subset takes place between the @xmath8 and @xmath66 configurations ( figure 1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculations show that even earlier ( i.e. at higher magnetic field strengths ) the global ground state acquires the total spin @xmath4 due to a crossover of the energy curve of the @xmath8 configuration with that of the configuration @xmath68 ( which is the local ground state for the @xmath4 subset in the high - field limit ) . for the fields below this point @xmath69 the ground state electronic configurations of the beryllium atom belong to the subset @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the beryllium atom has only one fully spin polarised ground state configuration ( as mentioned above ) .    the electronic configurations @xmath68 and @xmath8 differ by the replacement of the spin down @xmath63 orbital through the spin up @xmath70 orbital and according to the argumentation presented in the previous section the @xmath68 represents the _ local _ ground state configuration for the subset @xmath4 in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "analogous arguments to that presented in the previous paragraph provide the conclusion , that in the process of decreasing field strength the @xmath68 ground state electronic configuration can be replaced either by the @xmath71 or by the @xmath72 configuration .",
    "the numerical calculations show , that the curve @xmath73 intersects the curve @xmath74 at a higher magnetic field ( @xmath75 ) than @xmath76 crosses @xmath74 .",
    "the difference with respect to the order of the local ground state configurations in the subsets @xmath7 and @xmath4 stems from the difference in the magnetic field strengths characteristic for the crossovers in these subsets . at moderate field strengths ( @xmath4 )",
    "the influence of the coulomb fields of the nucleus and electrons prevails over the influence of the magnetic field and make the energy of the @xmath40 orbital lower than that of the @xmath41 orbital . on the other hand , at stronger fields characteristic for the subset @xmath7 the energies of these orbitals are governed mostly by the magnetic field and , in result , the energy of the @xmath41 orbital becomes lower than the energy of the @xmath40 orbital .    from our simple qualitative considerations we can conclude , that the configuration @xmath71 is the _ local _ ground state configuration of the subset @xmath4 for the weak field case , i.e. for @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , when we construct such a configuration , the first three electrons go to orbitals @xmath70 and @xmath40 forming the @xmath11 configuration with @xmath13 .",
    "the fourth electron must then have the same spin as the @xmath40 orbital electron to obtain the total spin value @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the lowest orbital which it can occupy is the @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , there are two local ground state configurations in the subset @xmath4 and they both represent the global ground state for some ranges of the magnetic field strengths .",
    "the necessary considerations for the subset @xmath3 are quite simple . at @xmath35 and ,",
    "evidently , for very weak fields the ground state of the beryllium atom has the configuration @xmath23 .",
    "we can expect , that when increasing the magnetic field strength , the next lowest state with @xmath3 will be the @xmath71 configuration with opposite directions of the spins of the @xmath40 and @xmath78 electrons . but both contributions , the zeeman spin term and the electronic exchange make the energy of this state higher than the energy of the state @xmath71 with the parallel orientation of the spins of the @xmath40 and @xmath78 electrons ( i.e. @xmath4 ) considered above .",
    "the calculated energies for these states are presented in figure 1 .",
    "thus , the beryllium atom has one ground state electronic configuration @xmath23 with the total spin @xmath25-projection @xmath3 .",
    "this state is the global ground state for the magnetic field strengths between @xmath35 and @xmath79 . above this point",
    "the ground state configuration is @xmath71 with @xmath4 .    summarising the results on the ground state configurations of the beryllium atom",
    "we can state that depending on the magnetic field strength this atom has four different electronic ground state configurations .",
    "for @xmath80 the ground state configuration coincides with the field - free ground state configuration @xmath23 which has zero values for the total magnetic quantum number @xmath81 and spin projection @xmath34 .",
    "the following are two ground state configurations with @xmath4 : @xmath71 ( @xmath82 ) for @xmath83 and @xmath68 ( @xmath84 ) for @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath9 the ground state configuration is @xmath8 with @xmath7 and @xmath86 .",
    "the complete results of the investigations of the sequence of the ground state configurations of the be atom are presented in table [ tab : begrcon ] which contains the critical values of @xmath47 at which the crossovers of different ground state configurations take place .",
    "the next aim of this section is the corresponding investigation of the ground state configurations of the ion @xmath10 .",
    "the field - free ground state of this ion corresponds to the @xmath11 configuration ( @xmath13 and @xmath87 ) . in the opposite case @xmath36 the ground state",
    "is obviously given by the @xmath14 configuration ( @xmath15 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "thus , we need to investigate only two different subsets of electronic ground state configurations : @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "the energy curves which are necessary for this investigation are presented in figure 2 .",
    "the subset @xmath13 contains only two possible ground state configurations @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the latter is the _ local _ ground state configuration for this subset in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "the curves @xmath88 and @xmath89 intersect at @xmath90 and above this point @xmath91 . in the subset @xmath15 we have to consider the configurations @xmath92 and @xmath93 along with the high - field ground state configuration @xmath14 .",
    "but the numerical calculations show that the energies of both @xmath92 and @xmath93 lie above the energy of the @xmath14 configuration at the intersection point ( @xmath94 ) between @xmath95 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the ion @xmath10 has three different electronic ground state configurations in external magnetic fields : for @xmath96 it is @xmath11 ( @xmath13 and @xmath87 ) , then for @xmath97 it is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath82 ) and for all the values @xmath98 the ground state configuration is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "these results are summarised in table [ tab : bepgrcon ] .",
    "the set of the electronic ground state configurations for the @xmath10 ion appears to be qualitatively the same as for the lithium atom @xcite .",
    "the field strengths for the corresponding transition points are roughly two times higher for the @xmath10 ion than for the li atom .",
    "in tables [ tab : beenergy ] and [ tab : bepenergy ] we present the total energies of the four ground state electronic configurations of the beryllium atom and the three ground state electronic configurations of the ion @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these data cover a very broad range of the field strengths from @xmath35 and very weak magnetic fields starting with @xmath99 up to extremely strong fields @xmath100 .",
    "the latter value of the field strength can be considered as a rough limit of applicability of the non - relativistic quantum equations to the problem ( see below ) .",
    "the corresponding data on the @xmath10 ion can be found in tables [ tab : bepgrcon ] and [ tab : bepenergy ] .",
    "so far there exist three works which should be mentioned in the context of the problem of the beryllium atom in strong magnetic fields . ref .",
    "@xcite deals with the @xmath23 state of this atom in fields @xmath101 and ref .",
    "@xcite investigates the ground state energies of atoms with nuclear charge number @xmath102 in the high - field , i.e. fully spin polarised regime .",
    "both these works contain calculations carried out by the method used in the current work and do not represent a basis for comparison .",
    "the comparison of our results with an adiabatic hartree - fock calculation of atoms with @xmath102 @xcite is presented in @xcite and we can briefly summarise this comparison for two values of the magnetic field strengths : for @xmath103 ( i.e. @xmath104 g ) our result is @xmath105kev whereas ref .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath106kev ; for @xmath107 ( i.e. @xmath108 g ) our result is @xmath109kev , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath110kev .",
    "this comparison allows us to draw the conclusion of a relatively low precision of the adiabatic approximation for multi - electron atoms even for relatively high magnetic fields .",
    "in figure 3 we present the ionization energy @xmath111 of the beryllium atom depending on the magnetic field strength .",
    "this continuous dependence is divided into six parts corresponding to different pairs of the ground state configurations of the be atom and @xmath10 ion involved into the ionization energy .",
    "the five vertical dotted lines in figure 3 mark the boundaries of these sections .",
    "the alteration of the sections of growing and decreasing ionization energy originates from different dependencies of the total energies of the be and @xmath10 on the magnetic field strength for different pairs of the ground state configurations of these two systems .",
    "one can see the sharp decrease of the ionization energy between the crossovers ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that @xmath111 is determined in this section by the rapidly decreasing total energy of the state @xmath14 of the @xmath10 ion ( figure 2 ) and by the energy of the be atom in the state @xmath68 which is very weakly dependent on the field strength ( figure 1 ) .",
    "another remarkable feature of the curve @xmath112 is its behaviour in the range of field strengths between the transitions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the ionization energy in this region contains a very shallow maximum and in the whole section it is almost independent on the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the ionization energy is stationary in this regime of field strengths @xmath113  a.u .",
    "typical for many magnetic white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the above - discussed properties are based on the behaviour of the total energy of the be atom and @xmath10 ion . on the other hand , the behaviour of the wavefunctions and many intrinsic characteristics of atoms in external magnetic fields are associated not with the total energy , but with the binding energies of separate electrons ( [ eq : ebin1 ] ) and the total binding energy of the system @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number of electrons .",
    "the binding energies of the ground state electronic configurations of be and @xmath10 depending on the magnetic field strength are presented in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "these dependencies at very strong magnetic fields may illustrate our considerations of the previous sections .",
    "one can see in figure 4 that the high - field ground state @xmath8 is not the most tightly bound state of the beryllium atom .",
    "for all the values of the magnetic fields considered in this paper its binding energy is lower than that of states @xmath71 and @xmath68 and for @xmath116 it is lower than @xmath117 . the latter circumstance can be easily explained by the fact that the @xmath23 configuration contains two tightly bound orbitals @xmath70 whereas the @xmath8 possess only one such orbital .",
    "however , with increasing magnetic field strengths the contribution of the group @xmath118 to the binding energy turns out to be larger than that of the @xmath119 group .",
    "analogously we can expect @xmath120 at some very large fields @xmath121 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is evident that the state @xmath8 must be less bound than @xmath68 because both these configurations are constructed of orbitals with binding energies , logarithmically increasing as @xmath36 , but the @xmath68 contains an additional @xmath70 orbital , which is more tightly bound than @xmath63 at arbitrary field strengths .",
    "the plot for the @xmath10 ion ( figure 5 ) illustrates the same features and one can see in this figure nearly parallel curves @xmath122 and @xmath123 in the strong field regime .",
    "figures 6 and 7 allow us to add some details to the considerations of the previous section .",
    "these figures present spatial distributions of the total electronic densities for the ground state configurations of the beryllium atom and its positive ion , respectively .",
    "these pictures allow us to gain insights into the geometry of the distribution of the electronic density in space and in particular its dependence on the magnetic quantum number and the total spin .",
    "the first pictures in these figures present the distribution of the electronic density for the ground state for @xmath35 .",
    "the following pictures show the distributions of the electronic densities for values of the field strength which mark the boundaries of the regimes of field strengths belonging to the different ground state configurations . for the high - field ground states we present the distribution of the electronic density at the crossover field strength and at @xmath124 . for each configuration",
    "the effect of the increasing field strength consists in compressing the electronic distribution towards the @xmath25 axis .",
    "however the crossovers of ground state configurations involve the opposite effect due to the fact that these crossovers are associated with an increase of the total magnetic quantum number @xmath81 .    in the first rows of figures 6 and",
    "7 one can see a dense core of @xmath20 electrons inside the bold solid line contour and a diffuse distribution of @xmath40 electrons outside this core .",
    "the prolate shape of the bold solid line contour in the first plot of the figure 6 ( @xmath37 , @xmath35 ) reflects the non - spherical distribution of the @xmath40 electrons in our calculations or the admixture of the @xmath125 configuration to the @xmath37 one from the point of view of the multi - configurational approach @xcite .    some additional issues concerning the results presented above have to be discussed .",
    "first , our hf results do not include the effects of correlation . to take into account",
    "the latter would require a multi - configurational approach which goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we , however , do not expect that the correlation energy changes our main conclusions like , for example , the fact of the crossovers with respect to the different ground states configurations . with increasing field strength the effective one particle picture should be an increasingly better description of the wave function and the percentage of the correlation energy should therefore decrease ( see ref.@xcite for an investigation on this subject ) .",

    "the last crossover of the ground state configurations takes place and for @xmath9 the ground state wavefunction is represented by the high - field - limit fully spin polarised configuration @xmath8 , @xmath7 .",
    "for the ion @xmath10 we obtain three different ground state configurations possessing two values of the spin projection . for fields below @xmath90",

    "this sequence does not coincide with any such sequences obtained previously for other atoms and ions and could not be predicted even qualitatively without detailed calculations .",
