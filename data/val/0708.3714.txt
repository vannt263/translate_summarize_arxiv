    "gedanken experiments that aim at probing spacetime structure at very small distances support the idea that noncommutativity of spacetime is a feature of planck scale physics .",
    "they show that due to gravitational back reaction , one can not test spacetime at planck scale .",
    "its description as a smooth manifold becomes therefore a mathematical assumption no more justified by physics .",
    "it is then natural to relax this assumption and conceive a more general noncommutative spacetime , where uncertainty relations and discretization naturally arise .",
    "noncommutativity is the central mathematical concept expressing uncertainty in quantum mechanics , where it applies to any pair of conjugate variables , such as position and momentum .",
    "one can just as easily imagine that position measurements might fail to commute and describe this using noncommutativity of the coordinates .",
    "the noncommutativity of spacetime can be encoded in the commutator[1 - 7 ] @xmath3=i\\theta^{ij}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a real , antisymmetric and constant tensor , which determines the fundamental cell discretization of spacetime much in the same way as the planck constant @xmath5 discretizes the phase space . in @xmath6 , by a choice of coordinates , this noncommutativity can be brought to the form @xmath7 this was motivated by the need to control the divergences showing up in theories such as quantum electrodynamics .",
    "this noncommutativity leads to the modification of heisenberg uncertainty relation in such a way that prevents one from measuring positions to better accuracies than the planck length . in low energy limit",
    ", these quantum gravity effects can be neglected , but in circumstances such as very early universe or in the strong gravitational field one has to consider these effects .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of space noncommutativity on the orbits of a test particle in noncommutative schwarzschild geometry .",
    "the modifications induced by the generalized uncertainty principle on the classical orbits of particles in a central force potential firstly has been considered by benczik _",
    "et al _ [ 8 ] . the same problem has been considered within noncommutative geometry by mirza and dehghani[9]and also by romero and vergara[10 ] .",
    "the main consequence of these investigations is the constraint imposed on the minimal observable length and noncommutativity parameter in comparison with observational data of mercury .",
    "recently , stability of planetary orbits of particles in noncommutative space has been studied both in central force and schwarzschild background by nozari and akhshabi[11 ] .",
    "here we are going to look at the kepler problem in noncommutative schwarzschild geometry from a different viewpoint .",
    "it has been shown that noncommutativity eliminates point - like structures in favor of smeared objects in flat spacetime[12 ] .",
    "the effect of smearing can be mathematically implemented as a substitution rule : position dirac - delta function can be replaced everywhere with a gaussian distribution of minimal width @xmath8 . in this framework ,",
    "the mass density of a static , spherically symmetric , smeared , particle - like gravitational source can be shown by a gaussian profile[13 ] . by adapting such a setup",
    ", we will find a generalized orbit equation .",
    "then we calculate the modification imposed by space noncommutativity on the value of the precession of the perihelion of mercury .",
    "the effect of space noncommutativity on the deflection of light ray in schwarzschild geometry is calculated and its numerical value is obtained .",
    "finally the issue of stability of circular orbits is discussed and the condition for a circular orbit to be stable in noncommutative schwarzschild geometry is obtained .",
    "commutative schwarzschild geometry is described by the following line element @xmath9 were we have set @xmath10 .",
    "we want to consider the effect of space noncommutativity on this line element .",
    "note that it is possible to consider the effects of space noncommutativity on einstein field equations also .",
    "one can argue that it is not necessary to change the einstein tensor part of the field equations , and that the noncommutative effects can be implemented acting only on the matter source[12,13,14 ] . since noncommutativity eliminates point - like objects in favor of smeared objects in flat spacetime , we choose the mass density of a static , spherically symmetric smeared , particle - like gravitational source as[13 ] @xmath11 solving the einstein equations with this matter source , one finds the following noncommutative schwarzschild line element[13 ] @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lower incomplete gamma function defined as ( see appendix ) @xmath14 in the limit of @xmath15 the classical schwarzschild metric is obtained",
    ". using noncommutative schwarzschild line element as ( 4 ) , in the next section we investigate the effect of space noncommutativity on the orbits of a test particle .",
    "along an affinely parameterized geodesic ( timelike , spacelike or null ) the scalar quantity @xmath16 is a constant[15 ] @xmath17 if the proper time or proper distance is chosen for @xmath18 , then @xmath19 for timelike and spacelike intervals . for a null geodesic @xmath20 . using the line element ( 4 ) we find for the timelike geodesics @xmath21 using the euler - lagrange equation @xmath22 for @xmath23 we find @xmath24=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath25    and @xmath26 these three equations along with equation ( 7 )",
    "provide us with the four equations needed for determining the four desired relations , namely @xmath27 one also could find the trajectory of the test particle projected into a slice @xmath28 to do this end , we consider motion in the equatorial plane , @xmath29 . from the equation ( 11 )",
    "we find @xmath30 where @xmath31 is constant of integration .",
    "also , integrating equation ( 9 ) , we get @xmath32 where @xmath33 is constant of integration . substituting ( 13 ) into relation",
    "( 7 ) , we obtain @xmath34 as usual , we define @xmath35 which leads to @xmath36 using relations ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) in equation ( 14 ) , we find the following differential equation for the orbit of a test particle in noncommutative schwarzschild geometry @xmath37 differentiating ( 16 ) we find the second order orbit equation @xmath38 this is the orbit equation in noncommutative schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "if we use the following approximation for incomplete gamma function ( see appendix ) @xmath39 then we can write equation ( 17 ) as follows @xmath40 @xmath41 the first two terms in the right hand side of equation ( 19 ) are the same as usual general relativity result[16 ] , the other terms are noncommutative corrections .",
    "this equation has a complicated solution that can be simplified as follows ( we set @xmath42 ) @xmath43+e\\frac{m^{2}\\sqrt{\\theta}}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}h^{4}}\\cos2\\varphi+\\frac{m^{3}\\sqrt{\\theta}}{6\\sqrt{\\pi}h^{5}}e\\varphi\\sin\\varphi\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a constant .",
    "the last two terms in ( 20 ) show the noncommutative correction and we defined eccentricity @xmath46 as in commutative case",
    ". the general form of this result is in agreement with the one obtained by a different method in reference [ 9 ] .",
    "since noncommutativity parameter is extremely small , the noncommutative corrections will be very small .",
    "however these corrections are important since they are related to the nature of spacetime structure at quantum gravity level .",
    "using the relation @xmath47=\\cos\\varphi+\\alpha\\frac{d}{d\\alpha}\\cos[(1-\\alpha)\\varphi]_{\\alpha=0}\\\\ = \\cos\\varphi+\\alpha\\varphi\\sin\\varphi\\ ] ] for small parameter @xmath48 , one can rewrite equation ( 20 ) as follows @xmath49+e\\frac{m^{2}\\sqrt{\\theta}}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}h^{4}}\\cos2\\varphi\\ ] ] where(@xmath42 ) @xmath50 so the period of the orbit is @xmath51 we have therefore found that , during each orbit of the particle , perihelion advances by an angle @xmath52 this contains an extra precession of the perihelion of the orbit due to space noncommutativity , @xmath53 in newtonian formulation of orbital motion , angular momentum is given by @xmath54 where @xmath46 is the eccentricity and @xmath55 the semi - major axis of the orbit[15 ] . using this relation and transforming ( 26 ) to non - relativistic units we find @xmath56^{3/2}}.\\ ] ] to have an estimation of this extra precession of perihelion , we consider the motion of mercury around sun . in this case",
    "we have @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59(see for example [ 15 ] ) and @xmath60[13 ] , we obtain @xmath61 mercury orbits once every 88 days , so we find @xmath62    we next consider the case of null geodesics to obtain effect of space noncommutativity on the light deflection in schwarzschild geometry",
    ". this can be done by changing the right hand side of equation ( 7 ) to zero @xmath63 using the same method as previous part , we reach at the following second order differential equation for the trajectory of a light ray in noncommutative schwarzschild geometry @xmath64 again using approximation ( 18 ) we can rewrite this equation as @xmath65 where the last two terms in the right hand side are the noncommutative corrections .",
    "the solution of this equation can be written in the following form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the special relativistic solution , @xmath68 and @xmath69 has the following form @xmath70}{d^{3}\\sqrt{\\pi}}.\\ ] ] @xmath71 is a constant with dimension of length .",
    "therefore , the general solution is @xmath72}{d^{3}\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\ ] ] in a commutative space one can find the solution for @xmath73 as[16 ] @xmath74 therefore we can write @xmath73 in noncommutative space as follows @xmath75}{d^{3}\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\ ] ] the last term in this relation is the correction due to space noncommutativity .",
    "we can now find the angle of deflection for a light ray using equation ( 36 ) .",
    "if we take the values for @xmath76 to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 when @xmath79(see for example [ 16 ] ) , then using small angle approximation for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we find the angle of deflection , @xmath82 , as follows @xmath83\\ ] ] again , the second term is the correction due to space noncommutativity . using this relation we try to find a numerical estimation for noncommutativity effect on the deflection of light ray . in non - relativistic units",
    "the contribution of space noncommutativity to the angle of deflection becomes @xmath84 since @xmath85 ( mean radius of sun ) , for a light ray just grazing the sun , the approximate value of the noncommutative correction becomes @xmath86 although this correction is very small , but it is important since it contains information about the nature of spacetime at quantum gravity level .",
    "note that the value of this term is dependent on the value of @xmath87 , the mass of central object .",
    "so for the case of very large masses such as very massive stars it may be large enough .",
    "+ from another view point , equation ( 37 ) could be used to find a limit on @xmath88 using observational data of deflection of light rays around sun .",
    "for noncommutative schwarzschild line element as given by equation ( 4 ) , there exist two killing vectors associated with energy and the angular momentum . in the equatorial plane ,",
    "@xmath89 , the killing vector associated with energy is @xmath90 or @xmath91,\\,0,\\,0,\\,0\\bigg)\\ ] ] and for the angular momentum the killing vector is @xmath92 or @xmath93 so , along the geodesics , the two corresponding conserved quantities are @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are energy and angular momentum of the particle per its unit mass . in the equatorial plane , @xmath89 and using equations ( 9 ) and ( 41 ) we find @xmath98 or @xmath99 where we have defined @xmath100 which is the _ effective potential _ in this noncommutative schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this noncommutative effective potential has been shown in figure @xmath101 in comparison with commutative schwarzschild case .",
    "the divergency around the origin is a manifestation of the existence of minimal length scale which prevents to probe distances smaller than a fundamental distance , for instance , planck length .",
    "the particle could have a circular orbit at @xmath102 if @xmath103 applying this to the effective potential ( 45 ) gives the equation which determines the radius of circular orbits @xmath104 so the condition for the stability of the circular orbits is @xmath105 @xmath106 combining ( 47 ) and ( 48 ) we find @xmath107 @xmath108 this is a complicated relation with no analytical solution for @xmath109 .",
    "instead , we have depicted the left hand side of this relation in terms of radius .",
    "the result is shown in figure @xmath110 . in newtonian mechanics",
    "the circular orbits are stable if @xmath111 . in commutative schwarzschild geometry",
    "this orbits are stable when @xmath112[15 ] .",
    "now we see that space noncommutativity increases the radius of stable circular orbits . as figure @xmath113 shows , in noncommutative schwarzschild spacetime",
    "the condition for stability of circular orbits is given by @xmath114 .",
    "so , the space noncommutativity increases the radius of stable circular orbits and this is a manifestation of smeared picture of objects in noncommutative geometry .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects of space noncommutativity on the orbits of particles in noncommutative schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the effects of space noncommutativity is so that it is not necessary to change the einstein tensor part of the field equation , and one can argue that the noncommutative effects can be implemented acting only on the matter part of einstein s equations . using this picture",
    "we have calculated the noncommutative orbital motion of test particle in noncommutative schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "an extra precession of the perihelion of the orbit due to space noncommutativity has been calculated and its numerical value is estimated using observational data of mercury .",
    "although this noncommutative effect is very small , it is important since reflect the nature of spacetime structure at quantum gravity level .",
