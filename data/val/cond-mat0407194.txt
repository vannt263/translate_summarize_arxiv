    "hybrid structures containing ferromagnetic materials became recently a focus of nanoelectronic research because of their relevance for spintronics applications .",
    "consequently , it is desirable to understand how in the case of a superconductor coupled to a ferromagnetic material superconducting correlations penetrate into the ferromagnet .",
    "a powerful method to treat such problems is the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity developed by larkin and ovchinnikov and by eilenberger @xcite . within this theory",
    "the quasiparticle motion is treated on a classical level , whereas the particle - hole and the spin degree of freedoms are treated quantum mechanically .",

    "first we demonstrate our method for a ballistic heterostructure containing a _ strong _ ferromagnet , for which we chose for simplification a completely polarized ferromagnet , a half metal .",
    "we show results for the modification of the quasiparticle density of states due to the proximity effect in the half - metallic material in a superconductor / half metal / superconductor device ( see fig .",

    "second , we study for a diffusive heterostructure containing a _ weak _ ferromagnet the influence of a domain wall of the bloch type on the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the corresponding setup is shown on the right in fig .",

    "the central quantity in quasiclassical theory of superconductivity @xcite is the quasiclassical green s function @xmath0 that depends on the spatial coordinate @xmath1 and time @xmath2 .",
    "it describes quasiparticles with energy @xmath3 ( measured from the chemical potential ) and fermi momentum @xmath4 moving along classical trajectories with direction given by the fermi velocity @xmath5.@xcite the quasiclassical green s function is a functional of self energies @xmath6 , which in general include molecular fields , the superconducting order parameter @xmath7 , impurity scattering , and external fields .",
    "the quantum mechanical degrees of freedom of the quasiparticles show up in the matrix structure of the quasiclassical propagator and the self energies .",
    "it is convenient to formulate the theory using 2@xmath82 matrices in keldysh space ( denoted by a `` check '' accent ) , the elements of which in turn are 4@xmath84 nambu - gorkov matrices in combined particle - hole ( denoted by a `` hat '' accent ) and spin space .",
    "the structure of the propagators and self energies in keldysh - space and particle - hole space is as follows , @xmath9 @xmath10    the elements of the 2@xmath82 nambu - gorkov matrices are 2@xmath82 matrices in spin space , e.g. @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and similarly for others . in writing eqs .",

    "_ e.g _ for a weak - coupling , @xmath17-wave order parameter the condition reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the strength of the pairing interaction , and @xmath20 denotes averaging over the fermi surface .",
    "the cut - off energy @xmath21 is to be eliminated in favor of the transition temperature in the usual manner .",
    "when the quasiclassical green s function has been determined , physical quantities of interest can be calculated .",
    "_ e.g. _ the equilibrium local density of states at position @xmath1 for quasiparticles with momentum @xmath4 and energy @xmath3 ( measured from the fermi level ) reads @xmath22 .",

    "the above equations must still be supplemented with boundary conditions at the interfaces .",
    "as these conditions are non - trivial in quasiclassical theory , we present these conditions in the following chapter in detail .      in order to formulate the boundary conditions at an interface between two materials , we define first an auxiliary propagator on each side of the interface @xcite . then we relate this auxiliary propagator to the full propagator via a transfer matrix .",
    "this approach is completely equivalent to a full scattering matrix approach as we will show at the end of this paragraph .",
    "however , the repeated andreev scattering processes across the interface complicate the full scattering matrix approach , and we found the current method much easier to implement and numerically more stable @xcite .",
    "we use for the auxiliary propagator the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the upper index @xmath26 determines the side of the interface ( left or right ) .",
    "the lower index denotes the direction of the fermi velocity . _",
    "incoming _ momenta ( index @xmath27 ) are those with a fermi velocity pointing towards the interface , and _ outgoing _ momenta ( index @xmath28 ) are those with a fermi velocity pointing away from the interface .",
    "we formulate here the boundary conditions for clean surfaces , which conserve the parallel component of the fermi momentum , @xmath29 .",
    "the auxiliary propagators as function of @xmath29 , energy @xmath3 , and time @xmath2 are solutions of the quasiclassical transport equation with the _ exact _ self energies , together with the normalization condition , however subject to the _ auxiliary boundary conditions _ , @xmath30 where the following symmetries hold , @xmath31 these boundary conditions are formally equivalent to boundary conditions for an impenetrable interface , however with a surface scattering matrix @xmath32 determined from the reflection amplitudes of the _ full _ scattering matrix as explained below .",
    "once these auxiliary propagators are obtained , the full propagators can be obtained directly , without further solving the transport equation , in the following way .",
    "we define hopping amplitudes @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for the four channels ( left incoming to right outgoing , right incoming to left outgoing , left outgoing to right incoming , and right outgoing to left incoming ) which conserve the momentum component parallel to the interface , @xmath29 . with the help of these amplitudes we solve for the _ transfer matrices _ , @xmath37 , for incoming trajectories from the following equations , @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding transfer matrices for outgoing trajectories are related to the ones for incoming trajectories through the relations @xmath40 particle conservation requires certain symmetries between the hopping elements , which are , @xmath41 consequently , only one amplitude , e.g. @xmath33 , contains free material parameters , the other three amplitudes depend on it .",
    "the hopping amplitudes are defined via the transmission amplitudes of the full scattering matrix as is shown below .",
    "formally , they describe the modifications of the decoupled problem due to virtual hopping processes to the opposite side .",
    "the _ full propagators _ , fulfilling the desired boundary conditions at the interface , can now be easily calculated . for incoming trajectories",
    "they are obtained from @xmath42 and for outgoing trajectories from @xmath43 in this formulation , the boundary problem effectively reduces to calculating the auxiliary green s functions for perfectly reflecting interfaces .",
    "numerically this is an extremely simple task , _",
    "e.g. _ , employing the procedure of riccati parameterization as explained below .",
    "afterwards the boundary green s functions for the partially transmitting interface can be obtained directly from eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) , since solving for the necessary transfer matrices ( [ tmatrix ] ) only involves a matrix inversion .    in the transfer - matrix description ,",
    "the phenomenological parameters containing the microscopic information of the interface are the two surface scattering matrices @xmath44 and the hopping amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "all three quantities are 2x2 matrices in spin space .",
    "as @xmath46 is unitary , it depends apart from the direction of the quantization axis on two parameters , a scalar scattering phase and a spin mixing angle ( or , equivalently , a spin rotation angle ) .",
    "similarly , as @xmath45 is hermitian , it also depends on two parameters , one describing spin conserving transmission and the other spin flip transmission .",
    "all remaining quantities defined above are related to these material parameters by symmetries .",

    "it accounts automatically for the normalization condition .",
    "a corresponding parameterization for distribution functions was applied to the keldysh part of the green s functions .",
    "the combined equations in their general form are @xcite @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath60 thus , the problem is reduced to the solution for two 2@xmath82 matrices in spin space , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . using fundamental symmetries ( particle  hole , retarded ",
