    "@xcite thus , the problem of locating the stationary points of a function is equivalent to the problem of solving @xmath1 equations in @xmath1 variables , and can be tackled analytically or numerically .",
    "a complementary approach for locating the stationary points is to look at the global landscape of the function @xmath0 in @xmath5 .",

    "in addition to explicitly verifying that the action is minimum for the classical world - line , this exercise permits a look at corrections to the action that arise when the trial world - lines deviate from the classical one . due to the global nature of this approach ,",
    "we are able to explore situations in which there are multiple classical world - lines that connect the two given events .",

    "<S> the hamilton action principle , also known as the principle of least action , and lagrange equations are an integral part of intermediate and advanced undergraduate mechanics . although the hamilton principle is oft stated as  the action for any nearby trial world - line is greater than the action for the classical world - line \" , the landscape of action in the space of world - lines is rarely explored . here , for three common problems from introductory physics - a free particle , a uniformly accelerating particle , and a simple harmonic oscillator - we present families of trial world - lines , characterized by a few parameters , that evolve continuously from their respective classical world - lines . with explicit analytical expressions available for the action , they permit a graphical visualization of the action landscape in the space of nearby world - lines . although these trial world - lines form only a subset of the space of all nearby world - lines , they provide a pedagogical tool that complements the traditional lagrange equation approach and is well - suited for advanced undergraduate students . </S>"
