    "the supernova remnant g266.11.2 has been reported as a possible @xmath2-ray source in the 1.156 mev line of @xmath3ti ( iyudin et al .",
    "1998 ) . the short lifetime ( @xmath090 yrs ) of this isotope , and the relatively small angular size of the remnant would imply an age of only @xmath0680 years and a small distance d@xmath0200 pc ( aschenbach et al . 1999 ) . thus g266.11.2 could be the remnant of the closest supernova event to have occurred in recent historical times .    however , _ asca _",
    "observations showed that the x ",
    "rays from the snr shell have a non - thermal spectrum and the fits require a high absorption value ( slane et al .",
    "2001 ) , favoring a distance of @xmath01 - 2 kpc that would place g266.11.2 well beyond the vela snr ( see also mereghetti & pellizzoni 2001 ) .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data revealed also a central point source , , surrounded by diffuse x  ray emission , that was interpreted as the neutron star associated to g266.11.2 .",
    "a _ bepposax _ observation ( mereghetti 2001 ) of the central region of g266.11.2 showed the presence of a second source about 3@xmath4 north of that detected by _",
    "asca _ and with a harder spectrum .",
    "the northern source was named sax  j0852.04615 . since the _ bepposax _ error circle of contained two bright early type stars that might have produced the observed x  ray flux , while no optical counterparts brighter than v@xmath015 were visible for ,",
    "it was unclear which of the two sources was the most likely neutron star candidate .    the puzzle has been recently solved by a _",
    "observation that provided an arcsecond position for ( pavlov et al .",
    "the new error box is incompatible with the two early type stars that were previously considered as possible counterparts , thus confirming that is the most likely neutron star candidate .",
    "was not detected in the 3 ks long _ chandra _ observation reported by pavlov et al .",
    "this might be due to variability , or to the hardness of this source , that was detected with _",
    "bepposax _ only above 5 kev",
    ". a deeper observation with _ xmm - newton _ confirmed the existence of , with a flux about ten times fainter than that of ( aschenbach , this conference ) .",
    "here we present optical observations of the fields of these two x  ray sources .",
    "optical images of the central region of g266.21.2 were obtained through the public archive of the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "these data consist of images in the r and b bands taken with the wide field imager instrument at the la silla 2.2 m telescope on july 30 , 1998 .",
    "we derived an approximate calibration of these data based on a number of stars of the usno catalogue .",
    "figure 1 shows the r band image of the _ bepposax _ error region ( 1@xmath4 radius ) of .",
    "the two early type stars that were previously considered as possible counterparts are the b8 type star hd76060 ( v=7.9 ) , and wray 16 - 30 , a b[e ] star with v=13.8 ( th et al .",
    "1994 ) also detected with iras .",
    "the small circle indicates the new position of determined with _ chandra _ ( pavlov et al . 2001 ) .",
    "no objects , down to limits of r@xmath022.5 and b@xmath023 are present at the _ chandra _ position , besides a star with r@xmath017 on the edge of the error circle . as discussed by pavlov et al .",
    "this object is probably a late type star and can not be the counterpart of the x  ray source .",
    "some diffuse emission is also visible to the west of the _ chandra _ position .",
    "this nebula is better seen in the h@xmath1 image shown in fig.2 .",
    "the brightest part of the h@xmath1 nebula has a roughly elliptical shape with dimensions @xmath040@xmath5@xmath620@xmath5 , and a sharply defined western edge .",
    "some nearly parallel filaments are also visible , one of which seems to be composed by a series of aligned bright spots ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the field of the northern source , , is shown in the r band image of fig.3 .",
    "the brightest stars in the _ bepposax _ error region ( 1@xmath4 radius ) have r@xmath015 , implying a ratio of x  ray to optical flux f@xmath7/f@xmath8@xmath90.1 .",
    "none of the stars in the error region has particularly unusual colors .",
    "the deep optical limits for the possible counterparts of confirm that this is most likely the neutron star remnant associated with g266.11.2 .",
    "an interesting h@xmath1 nebula has also been discovered in the data presented here .",
    "emission in the h@xmath1 has been detected around a few radio pulsars and is thought to originate in the interstellar medium shocked by the relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "these nebulae have either a  cometary  shape with the axis of symmetry along the direction of the pulsar transverse motion ( e.g. , psr b2224 + 65 (  guitar nebula  , cordes et al .",
    "1993 ) or psr b074028 ( stappers et al . these proceedings ) ) or an arc - like shape ( e.g. , psr j04374715 , bell et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the morphology of the diffuse emission shown in fig.1 and fig.2 does not present any obvious connection with the location of the candidate neutron star as determined with _",
    "it is more likely that the nebula is related to the b[e ] star wray 16 - 30 , which is located at the southern end of the nebula .",
    "however , its peculiar morphology and the location close to the center of g266.11.2 make this nebula a potentially interesting target for more detailed investigations .",
