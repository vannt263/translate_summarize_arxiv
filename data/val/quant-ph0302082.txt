    "a central topic in the current studies of collective effects in multi - atom systems are the theoretical investigations and experimental implementation of entangled states to quantum computation and quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "the term entanglement , one of the most intriguing properties of multiparticle systems , was introduced by schrdinger  @xcite in his discussions of the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "it describes a multiparticle system which has the astonishing property that the results of a measurement on one particle can not be specified independently of the results of measurements on the other particles . in recent years",
    ", entanglement has become of interest not only for the basic understanding of quantum mechanics , but also because it lies at the heart of many new applications ranging from quantum information  @xcite , cryptography  @xcite and quantum computation  @xcite to atomic and molecular spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "these practical implementations all stem from the realization that we may control and manipulate quantum systems at the level of single atoms and photons to store and transfer information in a controlled way and with high fidelity .",
    "all the implementations of entangled atoms must contend with the conflict inherent to open systems .",
    "entangling operations on atoms must provide strong coherent coupling between the atoms , while shielding the atoms from the environment in order to make the effect of decoherence and dissipation negligible .",
    "the difficulty of isolating the atoms from the environment is the main obstacle inhibiting practical applications of entangled states .",
    "the environment consists of a continuum of electromagnetic field modes surrounding the atoms .",
    "this gives rise to decoherence that leads to the loss of information stored in the system .",
    "however , it has been recognised that the collective properties of multi - atom systems can alter spontaneous emission compared with the single atom case .",
    "as it was first pointed out by dicke  @xcite , the interaction between the atomic dipoles could cause the multiatom system to decay with two significantly different , one enhanced and the other reduced , spontaneous emission rates .",
    "the presence of the reduced spontaneous emission rate induces a reduction of the linewidth of the spectrum of spontaneous emission  @xcite .",
    "this reduced ( subradiant ) spontaneous emission implies that the multi - atom system can decohere slower compared with the decoherence of individual atoms .",
    "several physical realisations of entangled atoms have been proposed involving trapping and cooling of a small number of ions or neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "this is the case with the lifetime of the superradiant and subradiant states that have been demonstrated experimentally with two barium ions confined in a spherical paul trap  @xcite .",
    "the reason for using cold trapped atoms or ions is twofold .",
    "on the one hand , it has been realised that the trapped atoms are essentially motionless and lie at a known and controllable distance from one another , permitting qualitatively new studies of interatomic interactions not accessible in a gas cell or an atomic beam  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the trapped atoms is that it allows to separate collective effects , arising from the correlations between the atoms , from the single - atom effects .",
    "on the other hand it was discovered that cold trapped atoms can be prepared in maximally entangled states that are isolated from its environment  @xcite .",
    "an example of maximally entangled states in a two - atom system are the superradiant and subradiant states , which correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the atomic dipole moments , respectively .",
    "these states are created by the interaction between the atoms and are characterized by different spontaneous decay rates that the symmetric state decays with an enhanced , whereas the antisymmetric state decays with a reduced spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the reduced spontaneous emission rate of the antisymmetric state implies that the state is weakly coupled to the environment . for the case of the atoms confined into the region much smaller than the optical wavelength ( dicke model ) , the antisymmetric state is completely decoupled from the environment , and therefore can be regarded as a decoherence - free state .",
    "another particularly interesting entangled states of a two - atom system are two - photon entangled states that are superpositions of only those states of the two - atom system in which both or neither of the atoms is excited .",
    "these states have been known for a long time as pairwise atomic states or multi - atom squeezed states  @xcite .",
    "the two - photon entangled states can not be generated by a coherent laser field coupled to the atomic dipole moments .",
    "the states can be created by a two - photon excitation process with nonclassical correlations that can transfer the population from the two - atom ground state to the upper state without populating the intermediate one - photon states . an obvious candidate for the creation of the two - photon entangled states",
    "is a broadband squeezed vacuum field which is characterised by strong nonclassical two - photon correlations  @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental interests in collective atomic effects is to demonstrate creation of entanglement on systems containing only two atoms .",
    "a significant body of work on preparation of a two - atom system in an entangled state has accumulated , and two - atom entangled states have already been demonstrated experimentally using ultra cold trapped ions in free space  @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) schemes  @xcite . in the free space situation ,",
    "the collective effects arise from the interaction between the atoms through the vacuum field that the electromagnetic field produced by one of the atoms influences the dipole moment of the another atom .",
    "this leads to an additional damping and a shift of the atomic levels that both depend on the interatomic separation . in the cavity qed scheme ,",
    "the atoms interact through the cavity mode and in a good cavity limit , photons emitted by one of the atoms are almost immediately absorbed by the another atom . in this case , the system behaves like the dicke model .",
    "moreover , the strong coupling of the atoms to the cavity mode prevents the atoms to emit photons to the vacuum modes different from the cavity mode that reduces decoherence .",
    "recently , the preparation of correlated superposition states in multi - atom system has been performed using a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement technique  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated coherent control of two rydberg atoms in a non - resonant cavity environment . by adjusting the atom - cavity detuning ,",
    "the final entangled state could be controlled , opening the door to complex entanglement manipulations  @xcite .",
    "several proposals have also been made for entangling atoms trapped in distant cavities  @xcite , or in a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite . in a very important experiment , schlosser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite succeeded in confining single atoms in microscopic traps , thus enhancing the possibility of further progress in entanglement and quantum engineering .",
    "this review is concerned primarily with two - atom systems , since it is generally believed that entanglement of only two microscopic quantum systems ( two qubits ) is essential to implement quantum protocols such as quantum computation .",
    "some description of the theoretical tools required for prediction of entanglement in atomic systems is appropriate .",
    "thus , we propose to begin the review with an overview of the mathematical apparatus necessary for describing the interaction of atoms with the electromagnetic field .",
    "we will present the master equation technique and , in addition , we also describe a more general formalism based on the quantum jump approach .",
    "we review theoretical and experimental schemes proposed for the preparation of two two - level atoms in an entangled state .",
    "we will also relate the atomic entanglement to nonclassical effects such as photon antibunching , squeezing and sub - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "in particular , we consider different schemes of generation of entangled and nonclassical states of two identical as well as nonidentical atoms .",
    "the cases of maximally and non - maximally entangled states will be considered and methods of detecting of particular entangled and nonclassical state of two - atom systems are discussed .",
    "next , we will examine methods of preparation of a two - atom system in two - photon entangled states .",
    "finally , we will discuss methods of mapping of the entanglement of light on atoms involving collective atomic interactions and squeezing of the atomic dipole fluctuations .",
    "the standard formalism for the calculations of the time evolution and correlation properties of a collective system of atoms is the master equation method . in this approach ,",
    "the dynamics are studied in terms of the reduced density operator @xmath0 of the atomic system interacting with the quantized electromagnetic ( em ) field regarded as a reservoir  @xcite .",
    "there are many possible realizations of reservoirs . the typical reservoir to which atomic systems are coupled is the quantized three - dimensional multimode field",
    ". the reservoir can be modelled as a vacuum field whose the modes are in ordinary vacuum states , or in thermal states , or even in squeezed vacuum states .",
    "the major advantage of the master equation is that it allows us to consider the evolution of the atoms plus field system entirely in terms of average values of atomic operators .",
    "we can derive equations of motion for expectation values of an arbitrary combination of the atomic operators , and solve these equations for time - dependent averages or the steady - state .",
    "another method is the quantum jump approach .",
    "this is based on the theory of quantum trajectories  @xcite , which is equivalent to the monte carlo wave - function approach  @xcite , and allows to predict all possible trajectories of a single quantum system which stochastically emits photons .",
    "both methods , the master equation and quantum jumps approaches lead to the same final results of the dynamics of an atomic system , and are widely used in quantum optics .",
    "we first give an outline of the derivation of the master equation of a system of @xmath1 non - identical nonoverlapping atoms coupled to the quantized three - dimensional em field .",
    "this derivation is a generalisation of the master equation technique , introduced by lehmberg  @xcite , to the case of non - identical atoms interacting with a squeezed vacuum field .",
    "useful references on the derivation of the master equation of an atomic system coupled to an ordinary vacuum are the books of louisell  @xcite and agarwal  @xcite .",
    "the atoms are modelled as two - level systems , with excited state @xmath2 , ground state @xmath3 , transition frequency @xmath4 , and transition dipole moments @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the atoms are located at different points @xmath6 , have different transition frequencies @xmath7 , and different transition dipole moments @xmath8 .    in the electric dipole approximation , the total hamiltonian of the combined system , the atoms plus the em field , is given by @xmath9   \\ , \\label{t1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the dipole raising and lowering operators , @xmath12 is the energy operator of the @xmath13th atom , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the annihilation and creation operators of the field mode  @xmath16 , which has wave vector @xmath17 , frequency @xmath18 and the index of polarization  @xmath19 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath20 is the mode function of the three - dimensional vacuum field , evaluated at the position @xmath21 of the @xmath13th atom , @xmath22 is the normalization volume , and @xmath23 is the unit polarization vector of the field .    the atomic dipole operators , appearing in eq .

    "therefore , we write the total hamiltonian  ( [ t1 ] ) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hamiltonian of the non - interacting atoms and the em field , and @xmath28 \\ , \\label{t6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the interaction hamiltonian between the atoms and the em field .",
