    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials are one of the most active areas of nanomaterials research due to their potential for integration into next - generation electronic and energy conversion devices @xcite .",
    "graphene , the most widely studied 2d material , is a zero - gap semiconductor with linear dispersion near the dirac points . as a result ,",
    "the charge carriers in graphene behave like massless dirac fermions @xcite . in addition to the extremely high carrier mobilities",
    ", graphene only absorbs 2.3% of visible light @xcite .",
    "thus , graphene may be a viable candidate for applications as a transparent conductor . compared to the traditional indium tin oxide ( ito )",
    ", graphene has several advantages in terms of weight , robustness and flexibility @xcite .",
    "recently , a new type of 2d material , borophene ( 2d boron sheet ) , has been grown successfully on single crystal ag(111 ) substrates under ultrahigh - vacuum conditions , and attracted tremendous interest due to their extraordinary properties @xcite . as scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated , borophene shows anisotropic metallic behaviour .",
    "furthermore , borophene is predicted to have extraordinary mechanical properties , which may rival graphene @xcite .",
    "in addition , borophene has its own advantage over graphene : due to the strongly anisotropic structure , the electronic and magnetic properties of borophene can be orientation controlled for flexible applications @xcite .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive understanding of the electronic , bonding , and thermodynamic properties of borophene is needed for applications in future devices .    inspired by the potential application of borophene , we perform first - principle calculations to study the structural and electronic properties of borophene .",
    "we also investigate the chemical bonding in detail .",
    "finally , the vibrational and thermodynamic properties of borophene are analyzed using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) .",
    "the calculations are performed using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) based on density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy is described by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional @xcite . to correct the intrinsic band problem in dft , hybrid functional methods based on heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06 ) method",
    "are adopted @xcite . in the hse06 method , a fraction of the exact screened hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange is incorporated into the pbe exchange using a mixing parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the wave functions between the cores are expanded in plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev . a 25@xmath115@xmath11 * k*-mesh",

    "then the electronic structure , chemical bonding and optical properties are calculated .",
    "the partial occupancies are treated using the tetrahedron methodology with blchl corrections .",
    "the harmonic interatomic force constants ( ifcs ) are obtained using dfpt within both supercell and linear response approach @xcite .",

    "for light polarized along x , @xmath33 increases rapidly at 2.41 ev , and reaches the maximum at 3.52 ev .",
    "the peaks of @xmath33 at 3.52 ev is probably due to the ` parallel band ' effect along @xmath34-x direction @xcite : when there is a band above @xmath35 that is approximately parallel to another band below @xmath35 , the interband transitions from a large number of occupied @xmath23 states below @xmath35 occur at the same energy , which results in a strong peak . for light polarized along y , the peaks of @xmath33 at 8.14 ev is stronger than other peaks .",

    "two prominent peaks are found at 4.59 ev and 12.85 ev respectively , which correspond to the free electrons plasmon peak .",
    "these represent the energy of collective excitations of the electronic charge density in the crystal . for * e*//@xmath6",

    "[ absorption](a ) , borophene has several absorption regions for * e*//@xmath5 around 3.65 ev and 10.36 ev . for * e*//@xmath6",
    ", three main absorption peaks are observed at about 1.09 , 8.29 and 10.31 ev .    in the visible region ,",
    "the reflectivity of borophene is lower than 30% for * e*//@xmath5 , while higher than 40% for * e*//@xmath6 , indicating that the optical properties of borophene can be orientation controlled .",
    "such properties provide opportunities for applications in display technologies , photovoltaics and flexible electronics .",
    "[ phonon ] presents the phonon spectrum along several high symmetry directions , together with the corresponding projected phonon density of states ( pdos ) .",
    "the primitive cell of borophene contains 2 atoms , corresponding to three acoustic and three optical phonon branches .",
    "similar to other 2d hexagonal materials @xcite , the longitudinal acoustic ( la ) and transverse acoustic ( ta ) branches are linear in the vicinity of the @xmath34 point , while the out - of - plane acoustic branch is quadratic along @xmath34-y direction . however , the za branch has imaginary frequency along @xmath34-x direction .",
    "negative frequency means that the restoring forces can not be generated for the za branch @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the lattice exhibits instability for long - wavelength transverse thermal vibrations , which can explain the observed stripe formation along the @xmath5 direction in the experimental stm images @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent studies have suggested that the tensile strength of borophene is dictated by out - of - plane soft - mode phonon instability under biaxial tension or uniaxial tension along the @xmath5 direction @xcite , and free - standing borophene is instable even under high tensile stress @xcite .",
    "the debye temperature @xmath36 can be calculated from the highest frequency of normal mode vibration ( debye frequency ) @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath40 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the calculated debye temperature for borophene is 863.86 k , which is higher than that of monolayer mos@xmath9 ( 262.3 k ) @xcite and black phosphorene ( 500 k ) @xcite , but lower than that of graphene ( 2,300 k ) @xcite . concerning thermal vibrations , the debye temperature is a measure of the temperature above which all modes begin to be excited @xcite , which will further affect the heat transport in borophene .",
    "we also investigate the vibrational properties of borophene by calculating the pdos for b(x ) , b(y ) , and b(z ) vibrations as shown in fig .",
    "[ phonon ] .",
    "the low - frequency acoustic phonon branches of borophene up to 450 @xmath41 are mainly from the b(z ) vibrations , while the high - frequency optical phonon branches are mainly from the b(x ) vibrations .",
    "the b(y ) vibrations contribute significantly to the phonon dos between 450 @xmath41 and 650 @xmath41 .        furthermore ,",
    "using phonon frequencies in the whole bz , we calculate the thermodynamic properties such as helmholtz free energy @xmath42 , entropy @xmath43 , and constant volume heat capacity @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45,\\ ] ] @xmath46-k_b\\sum\\limits_{\\textbf{q}j}\\ln[2\\sinh(\\hbar \\omega_{\\textbf{q}j}/2k_bt)],\\ ] ] @xmath47 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the partition functionq , * q * is the wave vector , and @xmath49 is the band index .",
    "[ thermal ] shows the temperature dependence of the calculated helmholtz free energy , entropy , and constant volume heat capacity for borophene . the free energy increases with increasing temperature , while the entropy decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "these two terms in fig .",
    "[ thermal ] are zero at 0 k , which is in complete agreement with the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "the heat capacity approaches the dulong - petit classical limit ( 49.88 j / k / mol ) at high temperatures .",
    "in this work , we investigated the electronic structure , chemical bonding , optical and thermodynamic properties of borophene by first - principle calculations .",
    "in contrast to 2d honeycomb materials , borophene has a highly anisotropic crystal structure .",
    "the band structure predicts that borophene exhibits highly anisotropic metallic behaviour .",
    "we also discuss the bond characteristics of borophene . the interatomic bond strength in borophene is stronger than that in buckled silicene , but weaker than that in planar graphene .",
    "the dielectric function , refractive index , conductivity , absorption coefficient , electron energy - loss spectrum and reflectivity are also calculated and discussed .",
    "large optical anisotropy is observed in borophene due to the anisotropic crystal structure .",
    "there is no absorption in the visible region , and the reflectivity is very low . due to the high optical transparency and electrical conductivity , as well as a variety of novel anisotropic properties , borophene can be used as transparent conductors for future applications in display technologies , photovoltaics and flexible electronics .",
    "the phonon spectrum and pdos are calculated using density functional perturbation theory .",
