    "it is well known that an initial impulse applied at one end of a granular chain in the absence of gaps or precompression can result in solitary waves propagating through the medium @xcite .",
    "apart from addressing fundamental problems of pulse dynamics in the presence of highly nonlinear interactions , this scenario also has direct practical application , e.g. , in designing shock absorbers @xcite , sound scramblers @xcite and actuating devices @xcite .",
    "thus , in the recent past pulse propagation in one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains of granules has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "several configurations and parametrizations of the 1d chain have been used to study pulse propagation in the face of dissipation  @xcite and of polydispersity in the structure and mass of the granules  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "polydispersity is frequently introduced in a regular fashion such as in tapered chains ( tcs ) , in which the size and/or mass of successive granules systematically decreases or increases  @xcite .",
    "polydispersity is also introduced by distributing masses randomly  @xcite , by  decorating \" chains with small masses placed regularly or randomly among larger masses  @xcite , and by optimizing grain distribution @xcite for particular purposes . in a recent study",
    "@xcite it was shown that the shock absorbing properties of a granular chain can be enhanced quite dramatically by decorating the chain with smaller granules . to our knowledge , however , most studies on decorated chains have been numerical and hence restricted to specific parameter values .",
    "one exception is the early work of nesterenko and laizardi  @xcite based on a continuum approximation , which is difficult to implement for chains with rapid spatial variations such as are inherently present in decorated chains .",
    "it is clearly desirable to devise new theoretical means to obtain analytic results for these systems .",
    "this is the goal of the present work .    in a recent paper  @xcite we analyzed pulse propagation in a variety of undecorated tcs . using a binary collision approximation , we presented analytical expressions for various quantities that characterize propagation of the pulse or pulse front in 1d tcs .",
    "however , an essential element of the success of this approximation is that a given pair of granules collides only once , that is that there be no rebounds .",
    "this approach is therefore not directly applicable to decorated chains , where one ( or more ) small / light granules between two large / heavy ones will rattle back and forth .",
    "a similar conclusion about the inapplicability of a two - body collision approximation ( different from ours ) to decorated chains was also reached in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the simplicity offered by the binary collision approximation is too tempting to discard it altogether .",
    "instead , we have succeeded in extending this theoretical scheme to decorated chains .",
    "thus , in this work we present such a scheme that allows us to make use of the binary collision approximation for decorated chains in which single small / light granules are placed between large / heavy ones .",
    "the case of more than one small granule placed between large ones is not yet part of our scheme , nor is it in most decorated configurations that have been considered ( numerically ) in the literature .",
    "such a generalization is however entirely feasible .",
    "our approach is based on a mapping of the decorated chain onto an effective undecorated chain .",
    "the effect of small decorating granules is included through a modified interaction between the bigger granules .",
    "this also requires the renormalization of the mass of the bigger granules .",
    "we present a systematic way to carry out this renormalization .",
    "the binary approximation is then used on the effective chain , which allows us to obtain analytical results for the quantities that characterize the pulse front propagation in these chains .",

    "in particular , we attempt to capture the time dependence of the velocity profiles of the granules as the pulse moves along the chain , and the time that it takes a pulse to travel along the chain .",
    "we also try to characterize the frequency of oscillation of the small granules that separate each pair of large granules .",
    "the frequency of oscillation of the small granules can be calculated by considering just a threesome of grains , two large ones with a small one in between .",

    "as noted above , this analysis will tell us something about the frequency of oscillation of the small granule , and it will also allow us to lay out the approximation scheme to be used in longer chains .",
    "the dynamics of the three granules is governed by the equations of motion    @xmath25    to convey the method most clearly , we have here taken the masses @xmath26 of the larger particles to be equal to each other and equal to unity in rescaled variables ; @xmath27 is the mass of the small granule .",

    "the frequency of these oscillations can be expressed in terms of the maximum force that the granule @xmath3 experiences from granule @xmath24 or @xmath23 .",

    "this shows that the pulse will be wider as compared to the monodisperse case .",

    "we have explicitly considered two different chains , simple decorated chains and forward tapered decorated chains . for simplicity , in order to obtain an effective description , we have assumed a fixed size for the small granules .",
    "however the method can be easily applied with little modifications to other more complicated decorated chains where small granules are also allowed to change size .",
    "the method is also implementable to decorated chains with more than one large granule between the small ones .",
    "a more extensive generalization is necessary to deal with decorated chains with more than one small granule between large ones and thence to other size profiles .",
