    "nonlinearity and discreteness in lattices lead to the existence of spatially localized stable solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions , called discrete breathers ( dbs ) , are characterized by time periodicity and a strong spatial localization of energy , on the scale of the lattice constant .",
    "the localized mode can be vibrational or rotational , depending on the lattice and type of excitation . in the second case the db",

    "the latter system is a convenient experimental tool to investigate the existence and dynamics of dbs .",
    "the discrete lattice here is constituted by an array of coupled underdamped small josephson junctions ( jjs ) .",
    "a jj is composed by two superconducting layers separated by a thin tunnel barrier .",

    "the equation for the superconducting phase difference between the two superconductor layers constituting the junction , @xmath0 , is written in the normalized form as    @xmath1    here the time unit is normalized by the inverse of the josephson plasma frequency @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the bias current @xmath4 normalized by its critical value and @xmath5 is the damping .",
    "this equation is formally equivalent to the equation of motion of a weakly damped pendulum in presence of an external torque @xmath3 .",
    "this mechanical analog allows for an easy description of the two possible states of the jj . if we apply a torque @xmath6 the pendulum will start to rotate with an average frequency @xmath7 .",
    "after the pendulum is driven to the rotating state , it will stay in this state , even for @xmath8 , as long as the external torque is large enough to compensate the damping term . so that at some range of @xmath3 both static and rotating states are possible , depending on the initial conditions . by the second josephson equation @xmath9 , these two states are the equivalent , respectively , to the superconducting and resistive states of the jj . in experiment by measuring the voltage on the jj it is possible to distinguish between these two states .",
    "josephson ladders allow for the existence of both oscillatory and rotational localized modes @xcite .",
    "however only the latter ones are easy to detect experimentally .",
    "a rotobreather in the josephson ladder is constituted by some of the jjs in the resistive ( rotating ) state , while the rest of jjs stays in the superconducting ( oscillating ) state .",
    "the rotobreathers were experimentally detected by measuring the @xmath10 characteristics of the jjs in different points of the ladder @xcite and also directly visualized by low temperature scanning laser microscopy @xcite .",
    "josephson ladders can support linear cavity modes that can interact with the localized modes @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the linear modes of the ladder with the localized modes was found to lead to nonlinear features in the characteristic of dbs .",
    "their complex dynamic in the region of the linear cavity resonances was investigated experimentally by the measurements of the @xmath10 characteristics of various dbs @xcite .",
    "single josephson cells have been proposed @xcite to provide an insight into complex discrete breather states of larger systems such as josephson ladders and two dimensional josephson junction arrays .",
    "broken - symmetry states with characteristics similar to those of discrete breathers were proposed to exist @xcite . we will call in the following these broken - symmetry states as _ breather - like _ states .",
    "superconducting loops with three josephson junction have also been recently proposed for the realization of a qubit @xcite .",
    "such a loop has an important property required for the qubit , namely two closely positioned minima in the dependence of its energy on the external magnetic field @xcite .",
