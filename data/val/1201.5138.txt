    "the reionisation of cosmic hydrogen represents a significant moment in the history of the universe .",
    "the appearance of the first stars and quasars heated and ionised the igm , catalysing the transition in which intergalactic hydrogen changed from being predominantly neutral to its present day , highly ionised state .",
    "understanding exactly how and when this phase transition occurred will offer insight into the nature of the first sources of light ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , existing constraints on the timescale and extent of reionisation are currently uncertain ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two primary observations which are used to constrain the epoch of hydrogen reionisation .",
    "the first of these are the absorption spectra of quasars at @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these enable detailed study of the igm ionisation state at high redshift , and indicate that the universe was reionised at @xmath7 ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the second observation is provided by measurements of the thomson optical depth , @xmath8 , to the surface of last scattering , which indicate that hydrogen reionisation could not have ended any earlier than @xmath9 ( @xcite ) . in practice , this constraint is consistent with a wide variety of extended reionisation scenarios .",
    "analytical and semi - numerical models have been confronted with a combination of these and other observations to place more quantitative limits on the reionisation redshift . in particular , studies by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite employ the above observables , alongside the observed distribution of lyman limit systems and constraints on the star formation rate , to model reionisation .",
    "these models can be used to infer constraints on the extent and completion time of reionisation .",
    "however , the lack of direct observational evidence at @xmath10 means that parameters in these models , such as the ionising background intensity and the thermal state of the igm , are relatively uncertain at high redshift .",
    "this implies that , from current observations alone , constraints on the redshift by which reionisation is complete remain loose , and can not be improved beyond @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a promising additional approach comes from measurements of the igm temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively long time scale of adiabatic cooling implies that the low redshift igm still carries the thermal imprint of reionisation heating from much earlier times .",
    "several authors have previously used this fact , combined with temperature measurements at @xmath12 , to constrain the end of the hydrogen reionisation epoch to @xmath13 ( @xcite ) . unfortunately , because the imprint of reionisation heating at @xmath14 reaches a thermal asymptote by @xmath15 these studies are limited by the relatively low redshift at which the temperature measurements were made .",
    "measurements of igm temperature at higher redshift therefore offer a new opportunity to tighten these constraints .",
    "a first step towards this was made by @xcite , who obtained a measurement of the igm temperature at mean density from absorption lines in the near - zone of the @xmath16 quasar sdss j0818@xmath171722 .",
    "although the statistical uncertainty on their single line - of - sight measurement was large , @xcite were nevertheless able to use a simple cooling argument to infer a reionisation redshift of @xmath18 ( to 68 percent confidence ) within the quasar near - zone , assuming hydrogen was reionised by population - ii stars .",
    "recently , @xcite have significantly extended these observational constraints by measuring the igm temperature in the near - zones of six further quasars at @xmath19 . in this work ,",
    "we therefore seek to extend the modelling of @xcite and include all seven near - zone temperature measurements to obtain a limit on the _ reionisation redshift for the general igm .",
    "_ specifically , by using a semi - numerical model to follow inhomogeneous reionisation and photo - heating of intergalactic hydrogen by stellar sources , as well any subsequent photo - heating by the quasar itself , we may calculate near - zone temperatures as a function of spatial position and reionisation redshift .",
    "a comparison of our model with the observational data then allows us to constrain the redshift at which reionisation completed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : semi - numerical model ] by introducing our semi - numerical model of reionisation , and proceed in section  [ sec : nion models ] to give a more detailed description of the modelling of ionising sources . predicted temperatures from the model for different reionisation scenarios are then described in section  [ sec : results ] , and we compare these to the @xcite quasar temperature measurements .",
    "our constraints on reionisation history are then discussed in section  [ sec : constraints ] , where we also assess the prospects for improving on these constraints in the future using additional quasar sight - lines .",
    "conclusions and further directions are then presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout the paper we use @xmath20cdm cosmological parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , consistent with recent studies of the cosmic microwave background ( @xcite ) .",
    "our model of inhomogeneous hydrogen reionisation simulates both the evolving ionisation state of the igm and its thermal history .",
    "the former is calculated using the semi - numerical model developed by @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite for similar approaches ) . the ionisation state derived from this model",
    "is then used to evaluate both the ionising flux and the mean free path at the lyman limit , and to infer a temperature distribution for the igm .",
    "we simulate the igm inside a periodic , cubic grid of side - length @xmath27 , containing @xmath28 voxels per side - length , with an over - density field @xmath29 generated using the transfer function of @xcite .",
    "the calculations detailing the evolution of ionisation structure in this density field ( which is initialised to a neutral state at @xmath30 ) are described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the model evaluates the ionisation fraction @xmath31 of a spherical region of scale @xmath32 around a given voxel at redshift @xmath33 as    @xmath34\\\\ & -&\\alpha_{\\rm b}cn_{\\rm h}^0\\left[1+\\delta_r\\frac{d_1(z)}{d_1(z_{\\rm obs})}\\right ] \\left(1+z\\right)^3q_{\\delta_r , r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the region s over - density , @xmath36 is the case - b recombination coefficient and @xmath37 is the clumping factor . in this work",
    "we shall assume @xmath38 , broadly consistent with recent results from hydrodynamical simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the justification for this choice , as will be discussed in more detail in section [ subsec : current ] , is that it tends to provide the weakest overall constraints on reionisation redshift .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath39 , the number of ionising photons entering the igm per baryon in galaxies , is left as a free parameter , the modelling of which will be described in more detail in section [ sec : nion models ] .    the production rate of ionising photons is then assumed to be proportional to @xmath39 and the rate of change of the collapsed fraction , @xmath40 , in haloes above some minimum threshold mass for star formation ( @xmath41 in neutral and @xmath42 in ionised regions , corresponding to virial temperatures of @xmath43k and @xmath44k respectively , e.g. @xcite ) . the collapsed fraction in a region of comoving radius @xmath32 and",
    "mean overdensity @xmath45 is found using the extended press - schechter model @xcite , which gives    @xmath46},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the complimentary error function , @xmath48 is the variance of the overdensity field smoothed on a scale @xmath32 and @xmath49 is the variance of the overdensity field smoothed on a scale @xmath50 , corresponding to a mass scale of @xmath41 or @xmath42 ( both evaluated at redshift @xmath33 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : history ] ) is solved at every voxel on a range of scales from @xmath51 to @xmath52 at logarithmic intervals of width @xmath53 .",
    "a voxel is then deemed to be ionised if it lies inside a region for which @xmath54 on any scale @xmath32 . by repeating this procedure at successive redshifts",
    ", we obtain our ionisation field as a function of @xmath33 .      in order to compute the heating of the igm",
    ", we must next obtain the ionising emissivity in each voxel of our simulation .",
    "we simulate the ionisation field at 30 regular redshift intervals between an initial redshift , @xmath55 , and the reionisation redshift , @xmath56 .",
    "these are , respectively , the redshifts corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 for the case where equation  ( [ eq : history ] ) is solved at mean density and @xmath60 . at each interval , if a voxel is flagged as ionised , we compute the intrinsic emissivity as the product of @xmath61 and the collapsed fraction above a minimum halo mass , @xmath62 .",
    "using this , the proper ionising photon production rate ( @xmath63 ) in units of photons @xmath64 , at each voxel , is    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the present day critical density , @xmath67 is a proton mass and @xmath68 is the mean molecular weight . in this instance , the smoothing scale @xmath69 used to calculate the collapsed fraction is given by the minimum of the ionised bubble radius and the mean free path at the lyman limit , @xmath70 .",
    "this is related to the ionising emissivity @xmath71 , ( in units of @xmath72 ) above the lyman limit frequency , @xmath73 , by    @xmath74    where we adopt a simple power law spectrum    @xmath75    here @xmath76 is the emissivity at the hydrogen lyman limit . below the ionisation edge , we take a spectral index of @xmath77 characteristic of soft , population - ii stellar sources ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . above @xmath78 , the spectrum is zero in order to enforce the requirement that there be no significant stellar ionisation of he  @xmath79 .",
    "this is necessary for consistency with our semi - numerical reionisation model which only traces the propagation of hydrogen ionisation fronts , and so can not predict the larger , extended fronts resulting from harder ionising photons . on the other hand",
    "this is not an unrealistic requirement , since the double reionisation of helium is thought to not complete until @xmath80 when the number density of quasars is at its peak ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , this assumption rules out the consideration of more exotic ionisation models involving early populations of quasars or population - iii sources , which could produce different thermal histories .",
    "more detailed modelling , which accounts for doubly ionised helium may therefore be performed in the future . in this work , however , we consider _ hydrogen reionisation by population - ii stellar sources only_.      having computed the intrinsic emissivity , the specific intensity , @xmath81 , at each voxel may then be calculated by accounting for the propagation and attenuation of radiation .",
    "this is a complicated calculation since , in general , it depends on the topology of regions around each point in the simulation and the distribution of lyman limit systems .",
    "a full numerical evaluation therefore requires radiative transfer , which is not included in our model .",
    "fortunately , the long - term thermal evolution ( for timescales longer than the local photo - ionisation timescale ) is relatively insensitive to the exact amplitude of @xmath81 , and instead depends primarily on the spectral shape of the ionising radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , to estimate the specific intensity we make the simplifying assumption that the mean free path is much smaller than the horizon scale , and use the local source approximation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the mean free path in two regimes , prior to and following the overlap of regions .",
    "prior to overlap , the mean free path is set by the size of bubbles ( @xcite ) , and may therefore be found by partitioning the ionisation field into approximately spherical regions . to do this",
    ", we smooth over the ionisation field at successive scales , employing the same logarithmic descent as for our density field . at each scale",
    "we calculate the size of discontiguous regions with a standard friend - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm .",
    "the bubble size for each voxel is then the scale of the smallest fof region of which it is part , augmented by the smoothing scale .",
    "this has the effect of dividing bubbles that only barely overlap into separate spheres so that the spherical approximation remains valid to a filling factor of around @xmath82 .",
    "we then assume that the optical depth to ionising photons is infinite beyond the region radius .",
    "lyman limit photons therefore travel one mean free path , corresponding to the region size , before being absorbed .    in the post - overlap case ,",
    "the igm is fully ionised and the mean free path of ionising photons is constrained by the abundance of lyman limit systems rather than the sizes of regions . in this instance , we employ a fit to the mean - free - path at the lyman limit in proper mpc , taken from @xcite :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 denotes the gamma function , and @xmath85 is the power law exponent of the column density distribution .",
    "observationally , the value of this exponent is unconstrained at @xmath10 , however at lower redshift measurements indicate @xmath86 @xcite . since this is roughly constant over the range @xmath87 @xcite , we simply extrapolate to high redshift and adopt @xmath88 throughout .",
    "we note that the column density distribution will change significantly as we enter the reionisation epoch , however as we are primarily interested in the value of @xmath89 in the post - overlap regime , this does not affect our results .",
    "finally , we assume that a given region is in the pre - overlap regime if its radius is less than @xmath90 ( i.e. the mean free path is not set by lyman limit systems ) and is in the post - overlap regime otherwise .    adopting the local source approximation , the ionising background specific intensity in each voxel may then be approximated by    @xmath91    where @xmath92 . prior to overlap",
    "@xmath93 is fixed to the region size , while post overlap it is given by equation  ( [ eq : mfp ] ) .",
    "lastly , note that in both regimes at frequencies above the lyman limit , we have @xmath94 .",
    "this effectively hardens the intrinsic stellar spectrum by @xmath95 , accounting for the additional heating due to filtering of the ionising radiation by discrete , poisson distributed absorbers in the intervening igm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "once the specific intensity at a given voxel is known , the photo - ionisation rates , @xmath96 $ ] , and photo - heating rates , @xmath97 $ ] , for @xmath98=h  @xmath99 , he  @xmath100 and he  @xmath101 , may be calculated via :    @xmath102    @xmath103    where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the photoionisation cross - section and frequency at the ionisation edge for species @xmath98 , respectively . the temperature evolution is then computed by solving :    @xmath106 - 2h(t)t + \\frac{t}{\\mu}\\frac{d{\\mu}}{dt},\\ ] ]    where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 and @xmath20 are the total photo - heating and cooling rates per unit volume , respectively .",
    "we ignore any heating resulting from the growth of density fluctuations as this is a minimal effect throughout the short timescale of reionisation .",
    "our code for solving equation  ( [ eq : thermal ] ) follows photo - ionisation and heating , collisional ionisation , radiative cooling , compton cooling and adiabatic cooling for six species ( h  @xmath100 , h  @xmath79 , he  @xmath100 , he  @xmath101 , he  @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) . the non - equilibrium abundances of these species are found by additionally solving three further differential equations coupled to equation  ( [ eq : thermal ] ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , and taking a uniform clumping factor of @xmath111 for all species .",
    "we use the rates compiled in @xcite with the exception of the case - b recombination and cooling rates of @xcite and the photo - ionisation cross - sections of @xcite .",
    "the gas density , @xmath112 , is evaluated from our linear over - density field using a standard log - normal fit ( @xcite ) , which approximates the real non - linear density for the majority of voxels . whilst this does not adequately reproduce the extreme over - dense and underdense tails of the density distribution ( @xcite )",
    ", its use does not represent a significant source of error since the temperature measurements we compare to are smoothed over the measured quasar near - zones ( @xmath113 proper mpc ) .",
    "inaccuracies in evaluating the thermal history of the small number of regions that fall within these tails are therefore unimportant .    using this prescription , we evolve the temperature of each voxel , independent of all others from an initial temperature @xmath114 and an initially neutral state .",
    "this procedure yields a final temperature distribution over our simulation volume as a function of redshift .",
    "the final part of our model is including the effect of the quasars themselves on the thermal state of the igm in their vicinity .",
    "the ionising flux from a quasar will significantly alter the thermal state of the surrounding igm , as its harder , non - thermal spectrum will also reionise he  @xmath101 ( @xcite ) .",
    "for any given quasar from @xcite , placed in the simulation volume at a random position , we account for this heating by augmenting the specific intensity in each voxel within the quasar proximity zone by an additional term    @xmath115,\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the proper distance from the quasar and @xmath116 is the quasar ionising luminosity , again taken to be a power law spectrum with index @xmath117 .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty concerning the exact value of this exponent towards high redshift .",
    "we therefore allow it to vary over the range @xmath118 , which is consistent with recent indirect estimates from observations of quasar near - zone sizes at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) . to compute the quasar luminosities at the lyman limit",
    ", we take the absolute ab magnitudes from @xcite .",
    "finally , we fix the extent of the region which experiences additional ionisation and heating by each quasar to 5 proper mpc , matching the radius within which the near - zones were analysed in @xcite .",
    "we next discuss the parametrisation of ionising sources in our model , encapsulated by the redshift - dependent parameter @xmath39 , the number of ionising photons entering the igm per baryon in galaxies .",
    "we begin by describing existing observational constraints on the igm ionisation state and then proceed to discuss how these are used to calibrate @xmath39 and its evolution with redshift .",

    "the measured quantity is the mean transmission of ly@xmath126 flux , @xmath127 , along the line of sight , or equivalently the effective optical depth @xmath128 .",
    "with knowledge of the physical properties of the igm , these can be converted into the background photoionisation rate per hydrogen atom ( @xmath129 ) . using full hydrodynamical simulations of the igm , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have measured @xmath119 from the forest opacity at @xmath130 .",
    "their derived values are shown in table [ tab : constraints ] .",
    "these measurements may then be compared to our own simulated ionisation rate , which is calculated using equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "when combined with equations  ( [ eq : ndot1])([eq : flux ] ) , and evaluated for the case of a uniformly ionised igm at @xmath131 this yields constraints on @xmath39 , which are also shown in table [ tab : constraints ] .",
    "the electron scattering optical depth provides an integrated constraint on the igm ionisation state throughout the epoch of reionisation .",
    "we use results from the latest wmap observations , @xmath132 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is related to the ionisation history by    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath135 is the hydrogen number density and @xmath136 is a correction factor due to the presence of ionised helium . in our model",
    ", we assume that the ionisation of traces that of h@xmath137 , whilst is instantaneously ionised at @xmath138 .          using these observations , we may now constrain possible parametrisations of @xmath39 in our model .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty concerning the exact shape of @xmath39 , particularly for @xmath10 , where there are no direct observations .",
    "indeed , several studies ( @xcite ) have found that @xmath61 is effectively unconstrained in the range @xmath139 . to explore the sensitivity of our simulated temperatures to changes in the ionising sources ,",
    "we therefore choose to employ two different models for the redshift evolution of @xmath39 .          the simplest model , and one often used in previous simulations of reionisation ( e.g. @xcite ) , assumes a single , redshift independent parametrisation of @xmath39 .",
    "however , this can not be reconciled with measurements of the photo - ionisation rate from the forest at @xmath140 , so we employ a slight variant on the model .",
    "we take @xmath39 to be a constant up to the reionisation redshift , which is found by solving equation  ( [ eq : history ] ) for a universe that is fully ionised by the desired redshift .",
    "this effectively fixes the reionisation history for any given @xmath141 .",
    "then , to ensure consistency with observations of @xmath119 , we allow @xmath142 to evolve linearly once reionisation is complete in order to best fit the data points at @xmath131 .",
    "this is broadly consistent with predicted increases in the escape fraction towards high redshift ( @xcite ) . as part of our constraint on @xmath141",
    "we impose the resulting electron scattering optical depth as an a  posteriori constraint on @xmath141 alongside the predicted temperatures in section [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "we also explore arbitrary ionisation histories that best match the @xmath8 constraint , by employing a model that is redshift - dependent prior to @xmath141 . to ensure enough freedom to match all constraints , we choose to follow the approach of @xcite and model @xmath39 as a cubic function , allowing for a large variety of different evolutions :    @xmath143 + n_{\\rm 0},\\ ] ]    where we have parametrised by the midpoint @xmath144 , and the peak @xmath145 .",
    "for each reionisation redshift , we fit this curve to the measured electron scattering optical depth and the ionisation rate at @xmath130 . as in @xcite",
    ", we impose a prior on the comoving emissivity of @xmath146 to disallow unphysically large ionising backgrounds .",
    "we stress that this model is not physically motivated and clearly overfits the limited data we use .",
    "however , as we do not seek to exactly find @xmath39 but only to view the effect of different ionisation histories on simulated igm temperatures , this does not significantly impact upon our results .      finally , the best fit evolution of @xmath39 and the filling factor @xmath147 for the cubic and linear models are shown in figure [ fig : nion ] for @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "for both cases , the behaviour of the emissivity matches quite well to results derived elsewhere ( @xcite ) , although note that for early reionisation in the cubic model , star formation switches on later and the filling factor develops more quickly in order to match the electron scattering constraint .",
    "importantly , the two models do provide very different ionisation histories at each @xmath141 and therefore should allow us to probe the sensitivity of our temperature predictions to realistic variations in the ionising background .",
    "we now examine the variation of igm temperature with reionisation redshift using the semi - numerical model described in the previous two sections . for any given @xmath141 , and for each of the two different parametrisations of @xmath39 , we compute an optimal @xmath39 evolution that ensures @xmath58 by @xmath141 .",
    "the resulting ionising background then allows us to calculate the temperature field over the redshift range @xmath150 , when the quasars analysed in @xcite are expected to have had their most recent optically bright phase .",
    "the igm temperatures predicted by our semi - numerical model at @xmath151 are summarised in figure  [ fig : allmaps ] .",
    "the top two rows display the results using our linear @xmath39 model , for reionisation completing by @xmath148 ( first row ) and @xmath152 ( second row ) .",
    "the left hand panels display temperature maps through the centre of the @xmath153 mpc simulation volume .",
    "the corresponding central panels show maps of the voxel ionisation redshifts relative to the redshift at which reionisation completes ( i.e. @xmath154 ) .",
    "we note that the structure of ionised bubbles at fixed @xmath155 is very similar for the early and late models . in the case of late reionisation , the temperature mimics this ionisation structure , with cooler regions centred on the small bubbles that were ionised first , and have thus had more time to cool .",
    "however , regions of the igm ionised during the overlap phase retain a clear imprint of heating .",
    "the situation is very different for early reionisation , where the temperature field shows little correlation with the reionisation topology . instead",
    ", the temperature largely reflects the random gaussian structure of the density field , indicating that even with reionisation occurring at @xmath149 , the temperature has already settled to an almost asymptotic state by @xmath156 .",
    "this asymptotic limit is also clear from the temperature - density relation ( right hand panels of figure  [ fig : allmaps ] ) . for @xmath152",
    ", the relation shows an almost power law dependence with @xmath157 for @xmath158 , characteristic of an asymptotic igm thermal state which is set by the competition between photo - heating and adiabatic cooling @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of late reionisation , the figure shows much wider 68 per cent confidence limits ( dashed lines ) below the highest densities , with an inverted power - law slope of @xmath159 for low densities ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the scatter and anti - correlation between temperature and density , which arises due to the fact that lower density regions tend to be ionised last allowing them less time to cool , is in qualitative agreement with results from previous numerical and analytical studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same set of results can also be seen for the cubic model of @xmath39 in the two lower rows in figure  [ fig : allmaps ] . in this case , the growth of ionised bubbles is significantly different at constant @xmath161 for the two reionisation redshifts . as described in section  [ subsec : parametrising nion ] , late reionisation ( @xmath148 ) is a more gradual process in this model , with ionisation times spread more evenly around the bubbles .",
    "this has the effect of spreading out the igm temperatures , so that regions ionised early tend to be cooler .",
    "similarly , the scatter in the temperature - density relation is increased . on the other hand , for @xmath149 ,",
    "reionisation is far more rapid , effectively occurring over a redshift interval of @xmath162 . despite this difference",
    ", the temperature field evolves , by @xmath156 , to the same asymptotic state as for the linear @xmath39 model ( with a slightly reduced scatter in the temperature - density relation due to the more abbreviated differences in ionisation time ) .",
    "this reaffirms the conclusion that the thermal memory of hydrogen reionisation for @xmath149 is largely erased by @xmath156 .    to see this more clearly , in figure [ fig : tvszplot ] we consider how the mean and standard deviation of the temperature distribution at @xmath156 evolve as a function of reionisation redshift .",
    "we note that the mean referred to here is not directly comparable to the measurements of @xcite as it is averaged over the entire density field in the simulation volume and is not simply the temperature at mean density .",
    "the results are shown for both the linear ( solid red ) and cubic ( dashed blue ) @xmath39 models .",
    "the mean temperature predicted by the two models only varies by several hundred degrees kelvin above @xmath163 , and an asymptotic state is fully reached for @xmath164 .",
    "however , for later reionisation redshifts the temperature distributions vary quite rapidly , and for the linear @xmath39 model at @xmath165 the igm is @xmath166 hotter than the asymptotic value .",
    "this result is slightly more muted for the cubic model , as the elongated reionisation history means that large regions of the igm have longer to cool , thereby reducing the impact of heating on the mean temperature .",
    "however , even allowing for this , unit changes in the reionisation redshift correspond to temperature variations of up to @xmath167 by @xmath156 .",
    "as this is comparable to the standard deviation of the distributions , changes of @xmath168 should be distinguishable on the basis of volume averaged temperature measurements for @xmath169 , but will require very precise data .    finally , note that the standard deviation exhibits a minimum at @xmath170 for both models , but increases to both lower and higher redshift . at @xmath171 ,",
    "this scatter is driven by the large variation in temperatures resulting from recent , inhomogeneous reionisation .",
    "in contrast , the scatter at @xmath172 is instead due to the steepening correlation between temperature and density which establishes itself following reionisation .",
    "both models asymptotically approach a value of @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "prior to the inclusion of quasar heating .",
    "note the results are obtained from the entire @xmath153 comoving mpc simulation box , and the mean is therefore volume averaged over all densities .",

    ", we must therefore also include the effect of photo - heating by the quasars themselves on the igm temperature .",
    "we calculate this heating as follows . at",
    "any given voxel in our simulation volume , we switch on a quasar @xmath182 yrs prior to the redshift at which the quasar is observed , and use the procedure outlined in section [ subsec : quasar heating ] to calculate the surrounding igm temperature .",
    "we then draw 200 random lines - of - sight within a @xmath113 proper mpc region around the quasar , and for each one we measure the temperature - density relation for all voxels .",
    "this relation may then be used to infer a temperature at mean density averaged over all 200 lines - of - sight . repeating this procedure for `` quasars '' centred on all voxels in the simulation box",
    "then gives a distribution for the temperatures around a single observed quasar .    in figure [ fig : tvszplotq ]",
    "we show the mean and standard deviation of the simulated temperature distributions _ at mean density _ for a quasar observed at @xmath175 .",
    "the results for the mean temperature are displayed for both hard ( @xmath177 , upper curves ) and soft ( @xmath176 , lower curves ) quasar spectral indices . the red solid and blue dashed curves again correspond to the linear and cubic @xmath39 models .",
    "these retain all the features of the temperature distributions prior to quasar heating , including the asymptotic behaviour of the mean at @xmath183 , and the minimum in the scatter at @xmath184 .",
    "note , however , the standard deviation tends to be slightly smaller , particularly at large @xmath141 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are now only considering the average temperature at a single ( mean ) density .",
    "we find that the maximum difference in the average temperature at mean density for the cubic @xmath39 model is only @xmath185 for early and late reionisation .",
    "given that the 68 per cent measurement uncertainties on the temperature around individual quasars obtained by @xcite are @xmath186@xmath187 , it is unlikely that a strong constraint can be obtained from any single line - of - sight observation .",
    "however , the combination of all 7 quasars analysed by @xcite reduces the 68 per cent confidence interval on the mean temperature of the quasar near - zones to @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , all seven lines - of - sight will be able , in principle , to distinguish between early and late reionisation scenarios .",
    "it is important to note that the rather uncertain quasar spectral index also introduces additional uncertainties into the interpretation of temperature .",
    "for example , in the cubic model the temperatures obtained for late reionisation combined with a soft quasar spectrum are almost identical to those obtained for early reionisation and a much harder quasar spectrum",
    ". unfortunately , there are no direct observations that constrain high - redshift quasar spectral indices , although a recent study of quasar near - zone sizes at @xmath6 demonstrated that the range @xmath118 is consistent with the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is in agreement with direct observations at lower redshift ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , but in practice the quasar spectral index will remain an uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "when calculating the measured temperature distribution expected around the quasars , we have thus far assumed a random distribution of quasar positions in our simulation volume .",
    "however , quasars and their host galaxies tend to trace high density regions owing to the clustering bias of massive haloes . before calculating the constraints on @xmath56",
    ", we therefore also model the quasar density bias .",
    "we weight the temperature distribution calculated in section  [ subsubsec : comparisons ] by the likelihood @xmath189 of observing a quasar at that location    @xmath190    the likelihood of observing a galaxy , and a corresponding resident quasar , is then estimated from the @xcite mass function as    @xmath191    where @xmath192 $ ] , @xmath193 $ ] , and @xmath194 , @xmath195 are constants .",
    "the results including this density bias within the cubic @xmath39 model are shown by the dot - dashed curves in figure [ fig : tvszplotq ] .",
    "there is a slight flattening of the temperature differences between different reionisation redshifts .",
    "this is due to the relatively early reionisation time of the high density regions where quasars are found , which allows them more time to cool to their asymptotic thermal state . at large values of @xmath141",
    "the temperature is also systematically higher .",
    "this is because the higher recombination rate in higher density regions results in slightly larger thermal energy input from photo - heating .",
    "this increased mean temperature makes it slightly more difficult for measurements of @xmath196 to differentiate between reionisation redshifts .",
    "however , this is a minimal effect which will not strongly affect our constraints on @xmath141 .",
    "in the remainder of the paper we turn to calculating the constraints that recent and possible future igm temperature measurements at @xmath6 impose on the hydrogen reionisation redshift . aside from a number of fixed assumptions including the clumping factor @xmath37 , star formation mass thresholds @xmath197 , the stellar spectral index @xmath179 , and the evolution of @xmath39 , there are two critical free parameters in our model , @xmath141 and @xmath198 . for any combination of these two free parameters , we compute mock observations for each @xmath141 and @xmath198 for the @xmath199 near - zone temperature measurement , @xmath200 . using bayes theorem , we then infer the likelihood for any set of 7 independent sightlines @xmath201 ( corresponding to the 7 measured temperatures from @xcite ) :    @xmath202    where @xmath203 is the combination of observational constraints obtained for @xmath204 , the ionising background and the quasar near - zone temperature measurements , @xmath205 is one of our models for reionisation , and @xmath206 is a normalisation constant",
    ". the likelihood @xmath207 can be easily found from the measured temperature distributions in figure [ fig : tvszplot ] and the measured errors on @xmath204 ( which are taken to be gaussian ) and @xmath208 .",
    "the prior probability of choosing any set of sight lines @xmath209 is calculated from the density bias likelihood in equation  ( [ eq : lh ] ) and the assumption that prior information on our free parameters is uniform over the ranges of interest , @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "redshifts outside this range are not considered as they are effectively ruled out at the lower end by the ly@xmath179 forest data ( @xcite ) and at the upper end by the measurement of @xmath204 ( @xcite ) .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : bayes ] ) , we may then find absolute bounds on the reionisation redshift by summing over sets of possible sightlines    @xmath212,\\ ] ]    where the kronecker delta @xmath213 arises since all seven sightlines are drawn from a single simulation box and correspond to one value of @xmath141 .",
    "we note , however , that the same does not hold true for the quasar spectral indices , as each of the individual quasars may have different intrinsic spectra .",
    "therefore , we only obtain constraints for each quasar spectral index individually :    @xmath214\\ ] ]    equations  ( [ eq : marginalise ] ) and ( [ eq : marginalisealpha ] ) produce model dependent estimates for our parameters of interest .",
    "we note that there are several uncertain aspects of our modelling , which can lead to significant variations in sightline temperature , particularly for late reionisation ( figure  [ fig : tvszplotq ] ) .",
    "to both compare the relative probability of our different models , and also obtain a less model dependent estimate of @xmath141 and @xmath215 , we use a bayesian model comparison to calculate the posterior probability for model @xmath216 given the data @xmath217    @xmath218    here @xmath219 is again a normalisation constant and we assume a priori that all models are equally likely so that @xmath220 is uniform .",
    "model averaging can then be used to infer probabilities of free parameters across all models    @xmath221    which provides a more general set of constraints on @xmath141 and @xmath215 .",
    "these constraints are not completely model independent as the set of models we consider is not complete .",
    "however , as our models bracket most of the physical uncertainties , they should be reliable .          in the upper panels of figure [ fig : zrconstraints ] , we present the resulting probability distribution functions over the parameter @xmath141 for the linear @xmath39 model .",
    "the distributions are computed for the two different sets of measurements presented by @xcite , derived from their fiducial model ( red solid curves ) and a model with additional pressure ( jeans ) smoothing in the igm ( blue dashed curves ) .",
    "the latter effectively lowers the near - zone temperature constraints by @xmath222 .",
    "the upper left panel displays the @xmath223 based on the measured values of @xmath181 , @xmath204 and @xmath208 . for comparison , in the upper right panel",
    "we also plot the individual distributions obtained by alternately considering constraints from either @xmath204 or @xmath196 alone combined with our assumed @xmath39 evolution .",
    "as expected , the measurement of @xmath196 alone does not differentiate between early reionisation redshifts , as for all scenarios the igm has reached an asymptotic temperature . however , the temperature data do provide constraining power for low @xmath141 .",
    "we find that irrespective of which set of temperature measurements from @xcite is considered , very late reionisation is ruled out to high confidence .",
    "this is because the @xmath187 increase in igm temperature for @xmath224 , pushes the mean quasar temperature well above the observations .    in the lower panels of figure [ fig : zrconstraints ] we show corresponding constraints for the cubic model excluding ( lower left panel ) and including ( lower right panel ) the effect of quasar density bias . in this model",
    "the observed value of @xmath204 is used in defining the parameters governing @xmath39 .",
    "it is therefore a much weaker a - posteriori constraint and we can no longer rule out reionisation at high redshift . similarly for low @xmath141 , the smaller temperature differences between reionisation scenarios means that late reionisation can not be excluded with the same confidence .",
    "furthermore , the relatively tight constraints obtained when considering the temperatures derived assuming a larger jeans scale are probably not robust , as the constraints from the fiducial measurements are favoured by a factor of around 3 over these .    the final model averaged distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : constraintsaverage ] , which corresponds to a mix of the fiducial results from the linear and cubic models . even though this largely ignores the models with the tightest constraints , we may still conclude that @xmath4 @xmath5 to 68 per cent ( 95 per cent ) confidence . as a sanity check",
    ", we also verify that the optimal temperatures predicted by our reionisation models match the measurements quite well .",
    "figure [ fig : mapestimates ] shows the predicted sightline temperature distributions for the maximum a - posteriori estimates of @xmath141 and @xmath215 compared to the observed quasar temperatures .",
    "we find that although two thirds of the modelled points lie within the 68 per cent confidence intervals of the observations , the model temperatures of quasars 0 and 1 ( following the numbering in figure [ fig : mapestimates ] ) appear to be systematically too high .",
    "however , for the fiducial @xcite measurements this does not provide a strong constraint ruling out our model , since the observed temperature distributions are both positively skewed and broader than gaussian . therefore , although our model predictions lie on the edge of the 68 per cent confidence interval , they are only about a factor of 1.5 less probable than the peak",
    ". the same does not hold true for the second set of measurements which account for additional jeans smoothing .",
    "these are ruled out with some significance , which may be indicate that the ( conservative ) systematic error due to additional jeans smoothing adopted by @xcite may have been slightly overestimated .",
    "the only real outlier then comes from quasar 5 in the fiducial measurements , which is unsurprising since this provides a significantly higher measurement of proximity - zone temperature .",
    "this may indicate that a quasar spectral index which is harder than the prior we have assumed ( i.e. @xmath225 ) may be required to reconcile this measurement with the simulations .",
    "it is interesting to contrast this result with recent evidence for a decline in the fraction of lyman break galaxies which exhibit strong emission from @xmath226@xmath227 @xcite .",
    "assuming the emission escape fraction does not evolve rapidly , this decline may be attributed to a corresponding decrease in the ionised hydrogen fraction to @xmath82 by @xmath228 , implying reionisation finished late .",
    "in addition , analyses of the size and shape of the near - zone observed in the spectrum of the quasar ulas j1120@xmath170641 are consistent with @xmath229 at @xmath230 ( @xcite ) , assuming the red damping wing is not due to a proximate high column density absorber .",
    "large neutral fractions of @xmath231 per cent at @xmath232 may be difficult to reconcile with our temperature measurements , which indicate @xmath233 @xmath5 to 68 per cent ( 95 per cent ) .",
    "such large neutral fractions could perhaps be reconciled with our constraint if the average quasar spectral index is much softer than we have assumed , resulting in lower temperatures for a given @xmath141 due to less photo - heating . on the other hand",
    "we note that other possible sources of _ hydrogen _ reionisation , such as population - iii stars or mini - quasars , have harder spectra than we consider here .",
    "these would therefore tend to increase the heating immediately following reionisation .",
    "this would then drive igm temperatures too high to match the @xcite observations assuming reionisation completed late .",
    "consequently , sources which have harder spectra than we have assumed would strengthen rather than weaken our conclusion that late reionisation is unlikely .",
    "similar considerations also apply to uncertainties in the clumping factor @xmath37 , briefly mentioned in section [ subsec : ionisation model ] .",
    "this is a highly uncertain parameter , whose impact we did not fully model but instead simply assumed to take on a uniform value of @xmath111 .",
    "the clumping factor has an impact on temperature evolution , since increases in clumping factor tend to increase overall recombination , implying more photons are needed to achieve reionisation .",
    "this results in a corresponding increase in igm heating on the order of @xmath234 for @xmath235 .",
    "however , we note that our choice of clumping factor lies at the low end of possible values derived from simulation ( @xcite ) .",
    "larger values of the clumping factor should then only rule out late reionisation with greater significance for models which have the same @xmath141 .    ,",
    "@xmath204 and @xmath236 when averaged over all our different models of reionisation .",
    "this includes different models for @xmath39 , the bias of quasars to high density regions and the jeans pressure smoothing scale .",
    "model averaging significantly weakens constraints as it adds uncertainties to the temperature , but still rules out late reionisation to @xmath4 @xmath5 at 68 per cent confidence and 95 per cent confidence respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]          in the previous section we presented constraints on the reionisation redshift from the existing measurements of the igm temperature around quasars at @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this work demonstrates the potential of high redshift igm temperature measurements to aid in ruling out very late reionisation , so it is therefore interesting to consider if future progress can be made with further data .",
    "we begin by creating mock catalogues of possible future observations . to do this",
    ", we assume that for a given @xmath141 , ionising source model and density bias model , @xmath237 observations are to be drawn .",
    "for each one , the quasar spectral index is drawn from the uniform prior over @xmath198 and the quasars are assumed to have an optically bright phase which starts at a redshift drawn from uniform distribution in the range @xmath238 .",
    "the median of each new observation is taken at random from our predicted temperature distribution for the chosen @xmath141 , the redshift at which the quasar turns on and @xmath198 .",
    "finally , the errors in the measurement around this median are assumed to correspond to one of the 14 ( 7 fiducial and 7 augmented jeans scale ) observational measurements chosen at random .",
    "once @xmath237 measurements are drawn in this way for each @xmath141 and model , we then use equations  ( [ eq : bayes ] )  ( [ eq : bma ] ) to obtain predicted probability distributions .",
    "this procedure for the generation of mock observations is repeated 100 times , and the resulting distributions are averaged .",
    "we then marginalise over the different ionising source models to obtain a predicted distribution @xmath223 for every @xmath141 from which the measurements are drawn .",
    "this allows us to estimate the confidence with which the reionisation redshift can be measured as a function of the true @xmath141 . for simplicity , we omit the constraints imposed by @xmath239 in order to assess the new information drawn from the temperature observations alone .",
    "we present our results in figure [ fig : confidences ] .",
    "the left panel shows the mode ( solid line ) and confidence intervals ( filled regions ) for @xmath240 , mimicking the constraints of the previous section .",
    "meanwhile , the right panel shows the same results for a large number of observations is a very optimistic scenario .",
    "obtaining one @xmath241 spectrum , even for the brightest known quasars at these redshifts , requires @xmath242 hours of integration on an 8-m class telescope .",
    "] , @xmath243 .",
    "we note that , in both cases , the mode typically recovers the true reionisation redshift in the models well , particularly for small @xmath141 .",
    "however , at no reionisation redshift do we obtain a particularly tight constraint for seven sight - lines only .",
    "for late reionisation , this is primarily due to uncertainties in modelling of both the quasar spectrum and the ionising efficiency .",
    "similarly , if reionisation happened early , we will not be able to distinguish well between different @xmath141 as the igm temperature reaches an asymptotic state independent of when reionisation occurred .",
    "however , increasing the number of observations from 7 to 100 can tighten our constraints on late reionisation considerably , increasing the potential 95 per cent limit on @xmath141 from 6.5 to 8.0 .",
    "improved constraints the average quasar euv spectra index from low redshift data could help to tighten our prior on @xmath198 , and further improve limits at least on late reionisation",
    ". however , to tighten constraints on early reionisation using igm temperature measurements ultimately requires observations which push to even higher redshifts .",
    "current understanding of the reionisation history is primarily built on existing observational evidence comprised of measurements of the gunn - peterson optical depth at @xmath244 , and the electron scattering optical depth of cosmic microwave photons .",
    "these measurements respectively probe only the tail end of the epoch of reionisation , and an integral measure of the reionisation history .",
    "the available constraints therefore permit a wide range of possible histories .",
    "observations of the igm temperature provide an additional complementary probe since the thermal memory of the igm yields information at redshifts beyond the those where observations are made .",
    "measurements of the temperature around high redshift quasars therefore offer a renewed opportunity to constrain the reionisation history of the universe .    in this paper , we have used measurements of igm temperature at @xmath245 ( @xcite ) to constrain the redshift at which the hydrogen reionisation epoch ended .",
    "our analysis employs a semi - numerical model for reionisation and heating , which is constrained to fit the cmb electron scattering optical depth , and the ionisation rate inferred from the ly@xmath179 forest at @xmath246 .",
    "we find that all models which reionise the universe prior to @xmath163 , settle to approximately the same igm thermal state by @xmath247 with relatively little scatter in the temperature at mean density . for late reionisation , ( @xmath248 )",
    ", the situation is different since there is significantly more variance in the igm temperature distribution .",
    "this arises partly from differences in ionisation time , which allow for different cooling times and a greater scatter .",
    "however , we find that there is always a detectable thermal imprint of at least @xmath249 , which differentiates the mean temperature signifying late reionisation @xmath250 from the asymptotic state achieved for @xmath251 .",
    "this implies that measurements of temperature in quasar near - zones can be used to constrain the reionisation redshift if it is sufficiently late .    including observational constraints from the cmb electron scattering optical depth and the forest opacity , we conclude that @xmath233 @xmath5 with 68 ( 95 ) per cent confidence .",
    "the @xmath6 temperature measurements therefore rule out a very late completion to reionisation .",
    "the inclusion of further temperature measurements in the future will tighten these constraints .",
    "if reionisation occurred early , we estimate a sample of 100 quasar spectra would rule out @xmath248 to 95 per cent confidence .",
    "however , in order to push these constraints further , more detailed modelling of the igm thermal evolution will also be required .",
    "in particular , the evolution of the ionising efficiency with redshift will have to be understood in order to narrow the modelling uncertainties for later reionisation scenarios .",
    "including the effect of hydrogen reionisation sources which have harder spectra than we have assumed here will also be valuable .",
