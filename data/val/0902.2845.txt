    "the research field on translationally cold ( @xmath1k and lower ) and ultracold ( @xmath1mk and lower ) molecules is continuously expanding in many directions , involving an increasing number of groups throughout the world .",
    "the availability of gaseous samples of cold neutral molecules opens entirely new avenues for fascinating researches , offering the possibility to control all degrees of freedom of a quantum system .",
    "molecular ions can also be trapped and cooled down inside atomic ion traps behaving like ionic crystals , where each ion is kept at a specific position with a residual motion equivalent to a temperature smaller than 1  k @xcite .",
    "cold neutral molecules brought new perspectives in high - resolution molecular spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the expected accuracy of the envisioned measurements with ultracold molecules makes them appear as a promising class of quantum systems for precision measurements related to fundamental issues : the existence of the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron @xcite related to cp - parity violation @xcite , and the time - independence of the electron - to - nuclear and nuclear - to - nuclear mass ratios @xcite , or of the fine - structure constant @xcite .",
    "various proposals have been suggested for achieving quantum information devices @xcite based on cold polar molecules ( i.e. molecules exhibiting a permanent electric dipole moment ) .",
    "elementary chemical reactions at very low temperatures could be manipulated by external electric or magnetic fields , therefore offering an extra flexibility for their control @xcite .",
    "the large anisotropic interaction between cold polar molecules is also expected to give rise to quantum magnetism @xcite , and to novel quantum phases @xcite .",
    "the achievement of quantum degeneracy with cold molecular gases @xcite together with the mastering of optical lattices @xcite built a fantastic bridge between condensed matter and dilute matter physics .",
    "indeed , the smooth crossover between the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of fermionic atomic pairs and the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) delocalized pairing of fermions related to superconductivity and superfluidity , has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "cold and ultracold neutral molecules can be formed along two paths :    * existing molecules in their vibrational ground state can be slowed down and cooled by various means , such as interactions with external electric and magnetic fields , or by collision with surrounding particles ( see for instance the review articles in refs.@xcite .",
    "this approach concerns a broad variety of small molecules ( oh , nh , no , so@xmath2 , nd@xmath0 , co , ybf , c@xmath3h@xmath4n , h@xmath2co , lih , cah , ... ) , but is currently limited to the production of molecules with a translational temperature around 10  mk . *",
    "pairs of trapped ultracold atoms can be associated using laser fields ( photoassociation , or pa ) @xcite , or time - varying magnetic fields ( magneto- or feshbach- association ) @xcite .",
    "translational temperatures as low as a few tens of microkelvins can be reached , and even lower when quantum degeneracy is achieved .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , these results are up to now limited to alkali diatomic molecules which are most often formed in highly - excited vibrational levels , i.e. with high internal energy .    in the latter case , a breakthrough occurred in 2008 , when the possibility to create ultracold bialkali molecules in the lowest vibrational level of their ground state or their lowest metastable triplet state , has been demonstrated .",

    "samples close to the degeneracy regime of ultracold molecules in the @xmath5 level of their ground state have been observed for cs@xmath2 @xcite , and krb @xcite , and in the @xmath5 level of their lowest triplet state for rb@xmath2 @xcite , using the stirap technique ( stimulated rapid adiabatic passage ) to transfer the population from initial high - lying vibrational levels .",

    "the rate constants have been found independent from the initially populated rovibrational level . a resonant feature observed in the loss rate after collisions between trapped ultracold cs@xmath2 molecules created by feshbach association has been interpreted as cs@xmath7-cs@xmath7 bound states @xcite .",

    "theoretical knowledge of the electronic structure of alkali triatomic systems is strongly needed for theoretical dynamical studies , which would support these experiments .",
    "there has been a significant research activity concerning the theoretical study of the structure and dynamical properties of homonuclear alkali - metal trimers .",
    "non - additive effects in spin - polarized alkali - metal trimers were studied by soldn _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite and the three - dimensional potential energy surfaces for the lowest quartet states were constructed for li@xmath8  @xcite , na@xmath8  @xcite , k@xmath8",
    "@xcite and rb@xmath8 @xcite . these were then used to study the corresponding spin - polarized reactive atom - dimer collisions at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "general trends for the lowest quartet state of homonuclear alkali trimers - correlated to three spin - polarized alkali atoms - have been described by hutson and soldn @xcite .",

    "he concluded that the single - reference coupled - cluster approach , which has been successfully used for homonuclear alkali - metal trimers @xcite , would be for various reasons very difficult to employ for calculations of the potential energy surfaces of heteronuclear alkali - metal trimers , and that an alternative approach to the problem should be sought .    in the present paper",
    ", we present such an alternative approach .",
    "we extend our previous works on effective two - electron diatomic molecules like alkali dimers @xcite and alkali hydrides @xcite to alkali trimers .",
    "we propose a preliminary study of the potential energy surfaces of the heaviest alkali trimer , cs@xmath0 , modeled as an effective three - electron molecule .",
    "our approach is based on large - core effective core potentials ( ecp ) with core polarization potentials ( cpp ) .",
    "we focused our work on two aspects : ( i ) the estimation of repulsion effects between the three cs@xmath9 ionic cores at short distances within the present ecp+cpp approach ; ( ii ) the comparison of the results with the results obtained by the molpro package for _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "the potential energies were calculated making use of the cipsi package ( configuration interaction by perturbation of a multiconfigurational wave function selected iteratively )  @xcite . as in our previous studies on alkali dimers , the alkali atom a is described by an @xmath10-dependent effective core potential ( ecp ) for the ionic core a@xmath9 @xcite including effective core polarization potential ( cpp ) terms @xcite , and by a large set of uncontracted gaussian functions for the valence electron .",
    "the atom is modeled as an effective one - electron system , permitting us to perform full configuration interaction ( fci ) calculations for any alkali dimer or trimer , considered as an effective two - electron or three - electron system , respectively .",
    "as the distance between different cores becomes smaller than the equilibrium distance of the system , it is well known that their electrostatic repulsion is not accounted for by this effective large - core potential . at the same time",
    ", the addition of the cpp term leads to an non - physical attractive behavior at short distances . for diatomic molecules ,",
    "an empirical repulsion term is usually added to the calculation ( see e.g. refs .",
    "if this short - range repulsive interaction in the triatomic molecule can be treated as the sum of pairwise interaction terms , computation of the potential surfaces would be greatly simplified . in order to check if such an approximation could be justified , we calculated the core - core repulsion at the hartree - fock level making use of the molpro 2006.1 quantum chemistry package  @xcite . for lithium and sodium , the all - electron correlation - consistent polarized core - valence quadruple-@xmath11 cc - pcvqz basis sets",

    ", the counterpoise - corrected dimer interaction energies were optimized using an algorithm implemented in molpro . in this algorithm",
    "the interaction energies were calculated at the coupled - clusters level making use of a single - reference restricted open - shell variant @xcite of the coupled cluster method @xcite with single , double and non - iterative triple excitations [ rccsd(t ) ] .",
    "the small - core scalar relativistic effective core potentials ecp46mdf was employed together with its uncontracted valence basis set , which was augmented by one set of diffuse function in an even - tempered manner ( aug - ecp46mdf ) .",
    "all electrons from the `` outer - core '' @xmath12 orbitals were included in the rcssd(t ) calculations .",
    "the full counterpoise correction of boys and bernardi @xcite was applied to all the interaction energies in order to compensate for the basis set superposition errors .",
    "the core polarization potential ( cpp ) is given by  @xcite :    @xmath13    the electric field @xmath14 is the one produced at point @xmath15 by all the other electrons and the ionic cores with static dipole polarizability @xmath16 :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the position vector from core @xmath19 to electron @xmath20 , @xmath21 the one between cores @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",

    "the @xmath24 term contains a purely geometrical part @xmath25 depending only on the relative positions of the nuclei :    @xmath26    for a diatomic molecule , @xmath25 is given by the familiar formula : @xmath27 .",
    "for a triatomic system , we have :    @xmath28    in those formulas , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the net charge and static polarizability of ion core @xmath20 .",
    "this term is independent of the _ ab initio _ calculation itself and is added _ a posteriori_.",
    "the part of the interaction between two nuclei other than the point charge repulsion has been dubbed `` volume effect '' by jeung in his 1997 paper on alkali diatomics  @xcite . here",
    ", we are interested in this volume effect for alkali triatomic systems . more precisely , we investigate whether it can be reasonably approximated as a sum of two - body terms .",
    "the two - body repulsion energies @xmath31 are calculated for all the alkali homonuclear diatomic molecules .",
    "the three - body repulsion energies @xmath32 are calculated for particular geometries , namely for d@xmath33 and d@xmath34 symmetries , to provide a representative investigation .",
    "calculations ar done at the hartree - fock level of theory starting with the orbitals of the free atoms .",
    "those orbitals are kept frozen as the internuclear distance is shortened . in this respect ,",
    "our calculations for the two - body term are similar to those of the `` a '' column from the tables of ref .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : compjeung ] in logarithmic scale . apart from a slight discrepancy in the case of na@xmath7",
    ", there is a good agreement between both calculations , and it is seen that the two - body core repulsion term could be well fitted by an exponential form , as already stated in ref.@xcite .",
    "three - body core repulsion energies have been calculated for all homonuclear alkali trimers at linear symmetric and equilateral geometries according to the schemes of figure  [ fig : geom ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : addlin ] , we compare the three - body core repulsion term for linear geometries @xmath35 ( the internuclear distance @xmath36 being defined in figure  [ fig : geom ] ) , with the sum of two - body term @xmath37 . in the same manner , we compare in figure  [ fig : addequi ] the three - body repulsion term for equilateral geometries @xmath38 to @xmath39 . in both cases",
    ", it is seen that the three - body core repulsion term is well described by a pairwise additive lemma , up to the region where it becomes negligible .",

    "it is worth noting that as the minimum of the quartet potential well is located at shorter distances than the minimum of the cs@xmath2 triplet state , the @xmath32 term indeed contributes to the depth of the well , and not only in the region of the repulsive wall .",
