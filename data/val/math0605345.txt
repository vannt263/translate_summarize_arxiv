    "i thank tony geramita , rick miranda , bernd sturmfels , and seth sullivant very much for their responses to an earlier version of this paper . in particular , they pointed out several very nice papers on secant varieties of which i was unaware . also , their responses raise the question of how the tropical approach relates to the degeneration approach of sturmfels - sullivant and dumitrescu - miranda . this question and the combinatorial - polyhedral problems introduced below",
    "will certainly lead to further research .",
    "finally , i thank hannah markwig for pointing out a gap in the proof of theorem [ thm : characterisations ] in an earlier version of this paper , and marius van der put who pointed out a theorem about affinoid algebras which can be used to fill that gap .",
    "secant varieties are rather classical objects of study in algebraic geometry : given a closed subvariety @xmath0 of some projective space @xmath1 , and given a natural number @xmath2 , one tries to describe the union of all subspaces of @xmath1 that are spanned by @xmath2 points on @xmath0 .",
    "we call the zariski closure of this union the @xmath2-th _ secant variety _ of @xmath0 , and denote it by @xmath3 . to avoid confusion : some authors call this the @xmath4st secant variety .",
    "so in this paper @xmath5 is the variety of secant lines , traditionally called _ the _ secant variety of @xmath0 .",
    "we will refer to all @xmath3 as ( higher ) secant varieties , and to their dimensions as ( higher ) secant dimensions .",
    "the standard reference for secant varieties is @xcite .",
    "already the most basic of all questions about the secant varieties of @xmath0 poses unexpected challenges , namely : what are their dimensions ?",
    "this question is of particular interest when @xmath0 is a _ minimal orbit _ in a representation space of a reductive group .",
    "these minimal orbits comprise segre embeddings of products of projective spaces , plcker embeddings of grassmannians , and veronese embeddings of projective spaces ; see section [ sec : minorbit ] . among these instances , only the secant dimensions of the veronese embeddings are completely known , from the ground - breaking work of alexander and hirschowitz @xcite .",
    "secant dimensions of segre powers of the projective line are almost entirely known @xcite .",
    "this paper introduces a new approach to secant dimensions , based on tropical geometry .",
    "tropical geometry is well known as a tool for transforming algebraic - geometric questions into polyhedral - combinatorial ones .",
    "recommended references are @xcite and the references therein ",
    "however , all background in tropical geometry needed here is reviewed in section [ sec : tropical ] .    in sections",
    "[ sec : join ] and [ sec : secant ] i present the tropical lower bounds on secant dimensions in terms of certain polyhedral optimisation problems . after a review of the necessary tropical geometry in section [ sec : tropical ] we prove the lower bounds in section [ sec : proofs ] . in section [ sec : minorbit ] i recall the notion of minimal orbits , and give two lower bounds on their secant dimensions .",
    "one of them is well known in special cases ; for instance , it uses rook coverings for segre varieties , and a variation of these for grassmannians @xcite . the other seems to be good for segre products of veronese embeddings .",
    "then in section [ sec : applications ] we apply the tropical lower bounds to segre varieties , veronese embeddings , and grassmannians , and show that they are better than the bounds from section [ sec : minorbit ] . as an example",
    ", we reprove the theorem that all but two veronese embeddings of the projective plane are non - defective ; this was proved earlier by hirschowitz @xcite using his `` horace method '' and by miranda and dumitrescu using degenerations ( private communication ) . also , i give a nice proof that the @xmath6-fold segre power of the projective line is non - defective ; this can not be proved using rook coverings alone , and is the first case not covered by @xcite .",
    "finally , seth sullivant and bernd sturmfels pointed out the paper @xcite to me , in which tropical secant varieties of ordinary linear spaces are considered . the precise relation between develin s tropical secant varieties and",
    "the tropicalisation of secant varieties is still unclear to me , though under reasonable conditions the former should be contained in the latter .    in conclusion ,",
    "the tropical approach is conceptually very simple , but shows very promising results when tested on concrete examples .",
    "however , it also raises many intriguing combinatorial - polyhedral optimisation problems ; i do not know of any efficient programs solving these .",
    "rather than projective varieties , we consider closed cones in affine spaces .",
    "so let @xmath7 be an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath8 , let @xmath9 be a finite - dimensional vector space over @xmath7 , and let @xmath10 be closed cones : zariski - closed subsets of @xmath9 that are closed under scalar multiplication .",
    "then we define the _ join _ of @xmath11 and @xmath12 as follows : @xmath13 note that in taking the closure we ignore the subtle question of which elements of @xmath14 can actually be written as @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; in this paper we are only interested in dimensions , and hence there is no harm in taking the closure .",
    "there is an obvious upper bound on the dimension of @xmath14 , namely @xmath18indeed , the summation map @xmath19 is dominant .",
    "we call this upper bound the _ expected dimension _ of @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath14 has strictly lower dimension than expected , then we call @xmath14 _ defective _ ; otherwise , we call @xmath14 _ non - defective_. the difference @xmath20 is called the _",
    "defect_.    taking the join is an associative ( and commutative ) operation on closed cones in @xmath9 , so given @xmath2 closed cones @xmath21 , their join @xmath22 is well - defined .",
    "again , we call this join defective or non - defective according as its dimension is smaller than or equal to @xmath23 .    in particular ,",
    "taking all @xmath24 equal to a single closed cone @xmath11 we obtain @xmath25 , called the @xmath2th _ secant variety _ of @xmath11 .",
    "the defect of @xmath25 , also called the @xmath2-th secant defect of @xmath11 , is defined in a slightly different manner : it is the difference @xmath26 ; hence if @xmath27 , then the difference @xmath28 is the _ sum _ of all @xmath29-defects for @xmath30 .",
    "we call @xmath25 defective if its defect is positive , and non - defective otherwise . finally , we call @xmath11 itself defective if and only if @xmath25 is defective for some @xmath31 , and we call the numbers @xmath32 the _ secant dimensions _ of @xmath11 . the standard reference for joins and secant varieties",
    "is @xcite .",
    "typically , one considers a class of cones ( e.g. , the cones over grassmannians ) , one knows a short explicit list of defective secant varieties of cones in this class , and wishes to prove that all other secant varieties of cones in this class are non - defective .",
    "one then needs _ lower bounds _ on secant dimensions that are in fact _ equal _ to the expected dimensions ",
    "so that one can conclude equality .",
    "our approach towards such lower bounds focuses on the following , special situation : suppose that @xmath21 are closed cones in @xmath9 , and single out a basis @xmath33 of @xmath9 .",
    "the method depends on this basis , but in our applications there will be natural bases to work with .",
    "let @xmath34 be the dual basis of @xmath35 .",
    "assume for simplicity that none of the @xmath24 is contained in any coordinate hyperplane @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , suppose that for each @xmath37 we have a finite - dimensional vector space @xmath38 over @xmath7 , again with a fixed basis @xmath39 of @xmath40 , and a polynomial map @xmath41 that maps @xmath38 dominantly into @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , every @xmath24 is irreducible .",
    "write each @xmath42 , relative to the bases of @xmath38 and @xmath9 , as a list @xmath43 of polynomials @xmath44 $ ] ; the fact that we use the same letter @xmath45 to indicate coordinates on the distinct @xmath38 will not lead to any confusion .",
    "for every @xmath46 and @xmath47 , let @xmath48 be the piecewise linear function @xmath49 defined as follows : write @xmath50 where the sum runs over all multi - indices @xmath51 for which @xmath52 is non - zero ; we view these @xmath53 as row vectors , i.e. , we will tacitly regard @xmath54 as a subset of @xmath55 .",
    "note that this is not an empty sum by the assumption that @xmath24 not lie in @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath48 is defined by @xmath56 where @xmath53 runs over the same domain , where @xmath57 is regarded a column vector , and where @xmath58 denotes the natural pairing between column vectors and row vectors .",
    "thus @xmath48 is a piecewise linear function , whose slopes correspond to the monomials in @xmath59 .",
    "[ thm : join ] the dimension of @xmath22 is at least the ( topological ) dimension of the polyhedral set @xmath60 in @xmath61 .",
    "as it stands , this theorem may not sound very appealing . for a more concrete reformulation",
    "we proceed as follows . for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and",
    "@xmath64 we say that _",
    "@xmath37 wins @xmath65 _ ( or @xmath66 ) _ at @xmath57 _ provided that    1 .",
    "@xmath67 for all @xmath68 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath48 is differentiable ( hence linear ) near @xmath69 .",
    "if this is the case , then we denote by @xmath70 the differential @xmath49 of @xmath48 at @xmath69 ; note that this is given by a row vector of natural numbers .",
    "if , on the other hand , no @xmath37 wins @xmath65 at @xmath57 , then we say that _ there is a tie on @xmath65 at @xmath57_.    for @xmath71 and @xmath46 set @xmath72 and call @xmath73 the _ winning set _ of @xmath37 at @xmath57 .",
    "collect the corresponding differentials @xmath49 in the set @xmath74 called the set of _ winning directions _ of @xmath37 at @xmath57 .    as we shall see in section [ sec : proofs ] , the dimension of @xmath75 in the theorem is equal to the maximum , over all @xmath57 , of @xmath76 this leads to the following corollary .",
    "[ cor : join ] the dimension of @xmath22 is at least the maximum , taken over all @xmath71 , of the sum @xmath76 in particular , if there exists a @xmath57 such that the set of winning directions at @xmath57 of each @xmath37 spans a space of dimension @xmath77 in @xmath55 , then the join @xmath22 is non - defective .",
    "this corollary suggests the following strategy for proving that @xmath22 is non - defective : try and find a point @xmath57 at which each @xmath37 wins a fair share of the basis @xmath33where fair means that the linear forms on @xmath78 by means of which @xmath37 wins its share , span a space of dimension @xmath77 . in the following section we make this strategy more concrete for the case of secant varieties , by making explicit the optimisation problem that needs to be solved to get a good lower bound on @xmath79 .",
    "suppose that we want to find lower bounds on the secant dimensions of a single closed cone @xmath80 , which as before is the closure of the image of a polynomial map @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath47 let @xmath82 be the set of all @xmath53 for which the monomial @xmath83 has a non - zero coefficient in @xmath84 . for @xmath85 , @xmath46 , and",
    "@xmath47 we see that @xmath37 wins @xmath65 at @xmath57 if and only if there is an @xmath86 which has @xmath87 for all @xmath88 unequal to @xmath89 .",
    "the winning set @xmath73 of @xmath37 at @xmath57 is the set of all @xmath66 with this property , and the set @xmath90 of winning directions is the set of all such minimising @xmath53 as @xmath66 runs over @xmath73 .",
    "hence we are led to consider the following optimisation problem , in which we relax the , at this point somewhat unnatural , restriction that all @xmath91 lie in @xmath92 .",

    "the following corollary is immediate from corollary [ cor : join ] .",
    "[ cor : secant ] the dimension of @xmath25 is at least the optimum of @xmath99 .    the bad news is : this lower bound need not be very good .",
    "the good news : we will see in section [ sec : minorbit ] that the bound is not useless  in particular for minimal orbits in representations where all weight spaces are one - dimensional  and in section [ sec : applications ] i give examples where the bound is very good .",

    "hence the lower bound of corollary @xmath106 on the dimension of @xmath25 is @xmath107 for all @xmath108not very good indeed .",
    "[ ex : polst ] let @xmath109_d$ ] be the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath110 in @xmath111 , and let @xmath11 be the cone in @xmath9 of pure powers @xmath112 .",
    "we prove that all secant varieties of @xmath11 are non - defective @xcite . as a parametrisation of @xmath11",

    "the coefficient of @xmath115 in @xmath116 is @xmath117 , so that @xmath91 consists of the vector @xmath118 only .",
    "hence corollary [ cor : secant ] suggests that we compute the optimum of @xmath119 .",
    "-th pure powers in binary forms are non - defective . ]",
    "now suppose first that @xmath120 .",
    "then it is not hard to find a @xmath121 such that @xmath122 contains both @xmath123 and @xmath124 , for all @xmath125 : draw @xmath126 lines @xmath127 in @xmath128 , all through @xmath8 and such that @xmath129 separates @xmath123 from @xmath130 ; and imagine any concave piecewise linear ( continuous ) function @xmath131 on @xmath128 which is non - differentiable precisely in the @xmath129",
