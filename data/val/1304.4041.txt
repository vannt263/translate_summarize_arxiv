    "breast cancer ( bc ) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer after the skin cancers , and the second leading cause of cancer death , following lung cancer among u.s .",
    "women @xcite . in 2012 ,",
    "an estimated 226,870 new cases of invasive bc and 39,510 bc deaths in women are reported in u.s .",
    "in addition , bc incidence and mortality rates have been increasing rapidly in economically less developed countries . according to world health organization , the reference process for breast cancer prognosis is histologic grading that combine tubule formation , nuclei atypia and mitotic counts @xcite .",
    "this assessment of tissue sample is synthesized into a diagnosis that would help the clinician determine the best course of therapy .",
    "several cad solutions exist for the detection of tubule formation @xcite and nuclei atypia @xcite but only few are dedicated to mitotic counts ( mc ) @xcite .    in histopathology",
    ", h&e is a well - established staining technique that exploits intensity of stains in the tissue images to quantify the nuclei and other structures related to cancer developments @xcite . in this context ,",
    "image - processing techniques are devoted to accurate and objective quantification and localization of cancer evolution in specific regions of the tissue such as cytoplasm , membranes and nuclei @xcite . from the chromatic viewpoint ,",
    "nuclear regions are characterized by non - uniform stain intensity and color , thus preventing a trivial classification based on color separation .",
    "in addition , the superposition of tissue layers , as well as the diffusion of the dyes on the tissue surface , may bring the stains to contaminate the background or other cellular regions , which are different from their specific target .",
    "one of the most difficult fields in histopathological dataset analysis is spatial analysis , more specifically automated nuclei detection and classification @xcite .",
    "the objective of nuclei classification is to assign different labels to different type of nuclei as normal , cancer , mitotic , apoptosis , lymphocytes etc .",
    "in addition , quantitative characterization is important not only for clinical applications ( e.g. , to reduce / eliminate inter- and intra - observer variation in diagnosis ) but also for research applications ( e.g. , to understand the biological mechanisms of the disease process ) @xcite .",
    "image analysis in cytology has been studied for years and numerous solutions @xcite have thus been proposed in the literature .",
    "the application of these solutions to histopathology is rather complicated due to the radical differences between the two imaging modalities and to the highly complex image characteristics .",
    "indeed , in the case of histology images , cellular structures and functions are studied embedded in the whole tissue structure , presenting various cells architecture ( gland formation , dcis ) very difficult to handle with usual pattern recognition techniques . nevertheless",
    ", recent work @xcite show great potential for computer assisted diagnostic of histopathological datasets for breast cancer diagnosis .",
    "multispectral imaging ( msi ) has the advantage to retrieve spectrally resolved information of a tissue image scene at specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "msi captures images with accurate spectral content correlated with spatial information and reveals the chemical and anatomic features of histopathology @xcite .",
    "this modality provides option to biologists and pathologists to see beyond the rgb image planes that they are accustomed to .",
    "recent publications @xcite have begun to explore the use of extra information contained in such spectral data .",
    "specifically , there have been comparisons of spectral methodologies which demonstrate the advantage of multispectral data @xcite . the added benefit of msi for analysis in routine h&e histopathology , however , is still largely unknown , although some promising results are presented in @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , there is no existing study of the advantage , or lack of thereof , of msi for automation of mcs in breast cancer histopathology .",
    "we propose here to extend the already successful work of @xcite to support msi and illustrate the advantages , paving the way for a better , automated detection of mcs in bc histopathology .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : previous ] reviews the state - of - the - art multispectral methods , particularly in object or region detection in histopathology , related to this research work .",

    "finally , the concluding remarks with future work are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the main idea for extracting texture features from msi is the use of combined spectral and spatial information for discrimination of regions or objects .",
    "we found few methods in the msi literature for texture characterization of histopathological images . some of them employed single band of msi @xcite and other used multiple bands of msi @xcite .",

    "@xcite coupled high - throughput fourier transform infra - red ( ftir ) spectroscopic imaging of tissue microarrays with statistical pattern recognition of spectra indicative of endogenous molecular composition and demonstrate histopathological characterization of prostatic tissue .",
    "they explicitly defined metrics consisting of spectral features that have a physical significance related to tissue biochemistry and facilitating the measurement of cell types .",
    "recently , masood et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a colon biopsy classification method based on spatial analysis of hyper - spectral image data from colon biopsy samples .",
    "initially , using circular local binary pattern algorithm , spatial analysis of patterns is represented by a feature vector in selected spectral band .",
    "later , classification is achieved using subspace projection methods like principal component analysis , linear component analysis and support vector machine .",
    "recently , wu et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a multilayer conditional random field model using a combination of low - level cues and high - level contextual information for nuclei separation in high dimensional data set obtained through spectral microscopy . in this approach ,",
    "the multilayer contextual information was extracted by an unsupervised topic discovery process from spectral images of microscopic specimen , which efficiently helps to suppress segmentation errors caused by intensity inhomogeneity and variable chromatin texture .",
    "malon et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a segmentation based features with convolutional neural networks using selected focus plane and spectral band for identification of mitotic figures in breast cancer histopathology and achieved best classification accuracy ( f - measure = 59% ) on multispectral dataset during icpr contest 2012 @xcite .",
    "these approaches @xcite are limited to single spectral band by ignoring additional relevant information from other spectral bands .",
    "boucheron et al .",
    "@xcite presented an analysis that the additional spectral bands contain further information useful for nuclear classification in histopathology as compared to the three standard bands of rgb imagery .",
    "using all image bands , they reported @xmath0 improved in performance as compared to next best performing image type .",
    "this method is limited to pixel level features .",
    "one possibility of additional improvement in object classification is multispectral spatial analysis using texture features .",
    "khelifi et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a spatial and spectral gray level dependence method in order to extend the concept of gray level co - occurrence matrix by assuming the presence of texture joint information between spectral bands .",
    "having the fact that some spectral bands have more relevant information for specific object or region classification as compared to other spectral bands .",
    "this approach is limited to single spatial feature as computed from all spectral bands rather than one different spatial feature for each spectral band .",
    "each object or region has different level of relevant information . in the proposed methodology",
    ", we address the shortcomings of previous works , including ( 1 ) comprehensive analysis of multispectral spatial features ( mssf ) in all bands rather than single band @xcite and ( 2 ) extracting mssf in order to discriminate mitotic figures from other nuclei and microscopic objects .",
    "the main novel contributions of proposed work are ( 1 ) selection of z - stack focus planes and multispectral bands for detection of candidates ; ( 2 ) a multispectral spatial and morphology features computation which leverages discriminant information from a given nucleus across bands and ( 3 ) a selection of features from multispectral features vector for classification of mitotic figures in breast cancer histopathological images .",
    "we evaluated the proposed framework on multispectral mitos dataset @xcite a freely available medical mitosis dataset .",
    "the data set is made up of 50 high power fields ( hpf ) coming from five different slides scanned at 40x magnification using a 10 bands multispectral microscope .",
    "there are 10 hpfs per slide and each hpf has a size of @xmath1 ( that is an area of 0.262 mm^2^ ) .",
    "the spectral bands are all in the visible spectrum . in addition , for each spectral band , the digitization has been performed at 17 different focus planes ( 17 layers z - stack ) , each plane being separated from the other by 500 nm . for one hpf , there are 170 gray scale images ( 10 spectral bands and 17 layers z - stack for each spectral band ) .",
    "these 50  hpfs contain a total 322 mitotic figures .",
    "the training data set consists of 35  hpfs containing 224 mitotic figures and evaluation data set consists of 15  hpfs containing 98 mitotic figures @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spectral_bands ] shows the spectral coverage of each of the 10  spectral bands of the multispectral microscope .          in this paper",
    ", we propose a framework for mc in multispectral bc histopathology as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : framework ] .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of all multispectral bands ( 10  bands ) and z - stack focus planes is performed for detection of mitosis candidates .",
    "then candidates are detected using thresholding and morphological operations on selected band and focus plane .",
    "a multispectral features vector is computed for detected candidates having intensity and texture features across all bands of multispectral images . in addition , using segmented regions of detected candidates , morphological features are also computed .",
    "a feature selection algorithm is employed on this multispectral features vector in order to save the computation cost , to discard any redundancy in the data , and to improve classification accuracy .",
    "classification is achieved using bayesian , decision tree ( dt ) , neural network as well as linear and non - linear support vector machine ( svm ) classifiers .",
    "a side advantage of performing the spatial analysis on a multiple band simultaneously is to investigate whether improvement in accuracy can be achieved with carefully selected multispectral features over those methods @xcite which use single band data .",
    "initially , we perform gradient analysis on all the focus planes . planes with lower average gradient ( i.e. out of focus ) are discarded .",
    "we select focus planes 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 ( total 6 focus planes ) . on selected focus planes , we compute the spectral responses of mitotic nuclei and background regions for all the available 10 spectral bands as represented in fig .  [",
    "fig : bands_histogram ] while responses of mitotic and non mitotic nuclei are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mitosis_nonmitosis_histogram ] .",
    "note that spectral band 1 ( white band ) , in nature , is different from others and might serve as reference as it contains all the information that other bands are containing , even if at a lower resolution .",
    "the peaks of the mitotic and non - mitotic nuclei are almost similar .",
    "mitotic nuclei have different peaks than background regions .",
    "multispectral data is thus able to differentiate between different tissue parts but spectral response of mitotic and non - mitotic nuclei is not distinguishable .",
    "the process of cell division has four different stages and each has different shape , size and textures .",
    "this motivates further spatial and morphological analysis on multispectral data to achieve reasonable classification of regions into mitotic and non - mitotic types .    using selected focus plane and spectral band , we eventually perform thresholding followed by morphological processing to eliminate small regions and fill holes and later select the candidates by filtering based on minimum size ( @xmath2 i.e. , 200 pixels ) and maximum size ( @xmath3 i.e. , 5405 pixels ) of mitotic nuclei while keeping the number of candidates to classify lower .",

    ", we also include morphological features ( such as area , roundness , elongation , perimeter and equivalent spherical perimeter ) that are computed from regions segmented during candidate detection .",
    "the morphological features reflect the phenotype information of mitotic nuclei . using spatial information in multispectral bands ,",
    "we compute five intensity - based features including mean , median , variance , kurtosis and skewness for candidate .",
    "this results in 50 multispectral intensity - based features .",
    "haralick co - occurrence ( hc ) @xcite and run - length ( rl ) @xcite features are computed with one displacement vector in four direction @xmath4 for all the spectral bands as in @xcite .",
    "these multispectral textural features are rotationally invariant . so by making average in all four directions , eight hc and",
    "ten rl features are computed for each candidate in each single spectral band .",
    "the resulted multispectral textural features vector consists of 80 hc features and 100 rl features for each candidate .",
    "the final mssf vector contains 235 features for each candidate .",
    "conceptually , a large number of descriptive features are highly desirable for classification of nuclei as mitosis or non - mitosis types .",
    "however , when using all computed features ( i.e. 235 features ) the classification performance is poor .",
    "some features are irrelevant for classification and some features are redundant degrading the classification performance .",
    "the consistency subset evaluation method  @xcite is employed to select a subset of features that maximize the consistency in the class values .",
    "a projection of subset of features is performed on training dataset in order to evaluate the worth of subsets of features by the level of consistency in the class value .",
    "the consistencies of these subsets are not less than that of the full set of features .",
    "later , we used these subsets in conjunction with a hill climbing search method , augmented with backtracking value 5 , which looks for the smallest subset with consistency equal to that of the full set of features .",
    "this procedure achieved 88% reduction in the dimensionality of features set by selecting 28 features .",
    "the selected features contained one morphological , 7  intensity and 20  textural features in different spectral bands except spectral band  5 .",
    "the selected features set is used to train different classifiers like decision tree ( funcational tre - ft ) , neural network ( multilayer perceptron - mp ) , bayesian , linear svm ( l - svm ) and non - linear svm ( nl - svm ) classifiers  @xcite . throughout the experiments , the parameters used in ft classifier are numboostingiterations = 15 and minnuminstance = 15 , in mp are learning rate = 0.3 and momentum = 0.2 , in l - svm classifier are bias = 1 , cost = 1 , eps = 0.01 and kernel = l2-loss svm and in nl - svm classifier are kernel = rbf , degree of kernel = 3 , eps = 0.001 and loss = 0.1 .",
    "the proposed framework is evaluated on mitos multispectral dataset @xcite .",
    "the results of candidate detection and classification methods are compared with ground - truth information provided along with the dataset .",
    "the metrics used to evaluate the mitosis detection of each method include : number of true positive ( tp ) , number of false positives ( fp ) , number of false negative ( fn ) , sensitivity or true positive rate ( tpr ) , precision or positive predictive value ( ppv ) and f - measure .",
    "in addition to mitos contest metrics , the proposed framework is also evaluated with other state of the art method as 5-fold cross validation .      to gain a better understanding of the relative contributions of specific spectral bands ,",
    "we perform candidate detection in all available spectral bands and six selected z - stack focus planes .",

    "<S> accurate detection of mitosis plays a critical role in breast cancer histopathology . </S>",
    "<S> manual detection and counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and intra - reader variations . </S>",
    "<S> multispectral imaging is a recent medical imaging technology , proven successful in increasing the segmentation accuracy in other fields . </S>",
    "<S> this study aims at improving the accuracy of mitosis detection by developing a specific solution using multispectral and multifocal imaging of breast cancer histopathological data . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to enable clinical routine - compliant quality of mitosis discrimination from other objects . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed framework includes comprehensive analysis of spectral bands and z - stack focus planes , detection of expected mitotic regions ( candidates ) in selected focus planes and spectral bands , computation of multispectral spatial features for each candidate , selection of multispectral spatial features and a study of different state - of - the - art classification methods for candidates classification as mitotic or non mitotic figures . </S>",
    "<S> this framework has been evaluated on mitos multispectral medical dataset and achieved 60% detection rate and 57% f - measure . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that multispectral spatial features have more information for mitosis classification in comparison with white spectral band features , being therefore a very promising exploration area to improve the quality of the diagnosis assistance in histopathology .    </S>",
