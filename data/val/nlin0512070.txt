    "in many engineering applications , communications delays between subsystems can not be neglected .",
    "such an example is bilateral teleoperation , where signals can experience significant transmission delays between local and remote sites . throughout the last decade ,",
    "both internet and wireless technologies have vastly extended practical communication distances .",
    "information exchange and cooperation can now occur in very widely distributed systems , making the effect of time delays even more central .    in the context of telerobotics",
    ", @xcite proposed a control law for force - reflecting teleoperators which preserves passivity , and thus overcomes the instability caused by time delays .",
    "the idea was reformulated in  @xcite in terms of scattering or `` wave '' variables .",
    "transmission of wave variables across communication channels ensures stability without knowledge of the time delay .",
    "further extensions to internet - based applications were developed  @xcite , in which communication delays are variable .",
    "recently , @xcite extended the application of wave variables to a more general context by performing a nonlinear contraction analysis  @xcite of the effect of time - delayed communications between contracting systems .",
    "this paper modifies the design of the wave variables proposed in  @xcite .",
    "specifically , a simplified form provides an effective analysis tool for interacting nonlinear systems with time - delayed feedback communications . for appropriate coupling terms , contraction as a generalized stability property is preserved regardless of the delay values .",
    "the result also sheds a new light on the well - known fact in bilateral teleoperation , that even small time - delays in feedback pd controllers may create stability problems for simple coupled second - order systems , which motivated approaches based on passivity and wave variables  @xcite .",
    "the approach is then applied to study the group cooperation problem with delayed communications .",
    "we show that synchronization with linear protocols  @xcite is robust to time delays and network connectivity , without requiring the delays to be known or equal in all links . in a leaderless network ,",
    "all the coupled elements tend to reach a common state which varies according to the initial conditions and the time delays , while in a leader - followers network the group agreement point is fixed by the leader .",
    "the approach is suitable to study both continuous and discrete - time models .",
    "after brief reviews of nonlinear contraction and wave variables , section @xmath0 uses simplified wave variable forms to analyze time - delayed feedback communications .",
    "the same approach is then applied in section @xmath1 to study group cooperation .",
    "concluding remarks are offered in section @xmath2 .",
    "inspired by the use of passivity  @xcite and wave variables  @xcite in force - reflecting teleoperation , @xcite performed a contraction analysis of the effect of time - delayed communications .",
    "as we will discuss in this section , the form of the transmitted variables in  @xcite can be simplified and applied to analyze time - delayed feedback communications .",
    "we first summarize briefly some basic definitions and main results of nonlinear contraction theory  @xcite .",
    "consider a nonlinear system @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 continuously differentiable .",
    "for any virtual displacement as a smooth function of the initial condition @xmath6 and of time , @xmath7 , then @xmath8 . ]",
    "@xmath9 between two neighboring trajectories , we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the largest eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the jacobian @xmath12 .",
    "hence , if @xmath11 is uniformly strictly negative , any infinitesimal length @xmath13 converges exponentially to zero . by path integration at fixed time , this implies that all the solutions converge exponentially to a single trajectory , independently of the initial conditions .    more generally , considering a coordinate transformation @xmath14 with square matrix @xmath15 uniformly invertible ,",
    "we have @xmath16 so that exponential convergence of @xmath17 to zero is guaranteed if the _ generalized jacobian matrix _ @xmath18 is uniformly negative definite .",
    "again , this implies in turn that all the solutions of the original system ( [ eq : nonlinear_form ] ) converge exponentially to a single trajectory , independently of the initial conditions .",
    "such a system is called _ contracting _ , with _",
    "@xmath19 .    in the sequel",
    ", we will also use _ asymptotical contraction _ to refer to asymptotic convergence of any @xmath17 to zero , which implies global asymptotic convergence to a single trajectory .",
    "wave variables  @xcite are used in bilateral teleoperation systems to guarantee the passivity  @xcite of time - delayed transmissions .",
    "the idea was generalized in  @xcite by conducting a contraction analysis on time - delayed transmission channels .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : teleoperation ] , @xcite considers two interacting systems of possibly different dimensions , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are constant matrices and @xmath23 , @xmath24 have the same dimension .",
    "communication between the two systems occurs by transmitting intermediate `` wave '' variables , defined as @xmath25 because of time - delays , one has @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two positive constants .",
    "it can be proved that , if both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are contracting , the overall system is asymptotically contracting independently of the time delays .    note that subscripts containing two numbers indicate the communication direction , e.g. , subscript `` @xmath31 '' refers to communication from node @xmath32 to @xmath0 .",
    "this notation will be helpful in section  [ sec : group - delays ] , where results will be extended to groups of interacting subsystems .",
    "let us now consider modified choices of the transmitted variables above .",
    "specifically , for interacting systems  ( [ eq : two - delay - systems ] ) , define now the transmitted variables as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two strictly positive constants .",
    "consider , similarly to @xcite , the differential length @xmath36 where @xmath37 note that @xmath38 this yields @xmath39 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both contracting with identity metrics ( i.e. , if @xmath40 and @xmath41 are both uniformly negative definite ) , then @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is bounded and tends to a limit .",
    "applying barbalat s lemma  @xcite in turn shows that , if @xmath44 is bounded , then @xmath45 tends to zero asymptotically , which implies that @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 all tend to zero .",
    "regardless of the values of the delays , all solutions of system  ( [ eq : two - delay - systems ] ) converge to a single trajectory , independently of the initial conditions . in the sequel",
    "we shall assume that @xmath44 can indeed be bounded as a consequence of the boundedness of @xmath43 .",
    "this result has a useful interpretation . expanding system dynamics  ( [ eq : two - delay - systems ] ) using ( [ eq : feedback - wave - variable ] ) yields @xmath50 so that the above communications in fact correspond to simple feedback interactions .",
    "if we assume further that @xmath51 and @xmath52 have the same dimension , and choose @xmath53 , the whole system is actually equivalent to two diffusively coupled subsystems @xmath54 note that constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 and thus coupling gains along different diffusion directions can be different",
    ". we can thus state    [ th : two - delayed - diffusion ] consider two subsystems , both contracting with identity metrics , and interacting through time - delayed diffusion - like couplings  ( [ eq : two - delayed - diffusion ] ) .",
    "then the overall system is asymptotically contracting .",
    "_ remarks _    * theorem  [ th : two - delayed - diffusion ] does not contradict the well - known fact in teleoperation , that even small time - delays in bilateral pd controllers may create stability problems for coupled second - order systems  @xcite , which motivates approaches based on passivity and wave variables .",
    "in fact , a key condition for contraction to be preserved is that the diffusion - like coupling gains be symmetric positive semi - definite _ in the same metric _ as the subsystems , as we shall illustrate later in this section .",
    "* if there are no delays , i.e. , @xmath55 , then @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the analysis of the differential length yields that @xmath57 where @xmath58 this implies that @xmath46 and @xmath59 tend to zero exponentially for contracting dynamics @xmath29 and @xmath30 , i.e. , the overall system is exponentially contracting . *",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both contracting and time - invariant , all solutions of system  ( [ eq : two - delayed - diffusion ] ) converge to a unique equilibrium point , whose value is independent of the time delays and the initial conditions . indeed , in a globally contracting autonomous system , all trajectories converge to a unique equilibrium point  @xcite , which implies that if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both contracting and time - invariant , an equilibrium point must exist for system  ( [ eq : two - delayed - diffusion ] ) when @xmath55 . in turn , this point remains an equilibrium point for arbitrary non - zero @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "since the delayed system  ( [ eq : two - delayed - diffusion ] ) also preserves contraction , all solutions will converge to this point independently of the initial conditions and the explicit values of the delays .",
