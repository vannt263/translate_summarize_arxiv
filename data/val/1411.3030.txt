    "recently , a two - solar - mass ( 1.97@xmath70.04 @xmath8 ) neutron star ( ns ) psr j1614 - 2230 has been observed using shapiro delay @xcite .",
    "this new discovery provided a limit for heavy neutron stars and constrains the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "et al . _ have done a systematic study of 240 skyrme eos using the mass of this particular ns as one of the criteria to select the eos .",
    "they found that only five out of 240 eos pass all the criteria @xcite .",
    "we also studied the correlation of the maximum mass and radius of ns with the incompressibility @xmath3 , the symmetry energy @xmath4 , the slope of the symmetry energy @xmath5 and its incompressibility @xmath6 by solving the tov equations for pure neutron matter ( pnm ) with 159 skyrme eos @xcite .",
    "we found that there might be a correlation between the maximum mass and the radius of the ns with @xmath6 .",
    "there are many factors that can affect the maximum mass - radius relation of ns , e.g. the proton fraction in the ns @xcite , hyperons @xcite , three - neutron interactions @xcite , the hadron - quark phase transition ( pt ) @xcite , the strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus , it is difficult to constrain the eos without taking into account all the observations of the ns . in this paper",
    ", we discuss two eos derived from landau s theory ( lt ) : ccs@xmath03 and ccs@xmath05 @xcite and two simple skyrme eos : ck225 and ck225@xmath9 @xcite , which , in principle , do not include any pt at high densities .",
    "we first show that even though the different eos might have the same properties , i.e. same @xmath1 , ground state density @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , for the ground state ( gs ) of symmetric nuclear matter , they result in completely different mass - radius relations for ns . thus fixing the parameters entering the eos on the gs of symmetric nuclear matter is not sufficient to make predictions for ns .",
    "the maximum mass of the ns is the result of the competition between a possible pt and the highest power of density in the eos @xcite .",
    "the ccs@xmath05 eos contains enough free parameters in such a way that we can fix all of them to currently accepted values apart @xmath6 .",
    "we show that by changing this last value we find solutions which are unstable at high densities . in lt",
    "this is the result of a first order pt .",
    "the resulting scenario is that very massive neutron stars are probably in the quark phase ( lt does not tell us what species are involved , but only that there is a pt ) while lighter stars are made of baryons . for intermediate systems ,",
    "the stars are unstable and we associate these to the occurrence of supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "other eos might display instabilities at high densities as well if one opportunely changes the @xmath5 parameter for a given symmetry energy @xmath4 .",
    "in lt , the free energy or eos at zero temperature can be expanded as a function of one or more order parameters @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed the eos of symmetric nuclear matter assuming @xmath10 is an order parameter : @xmath11 where @xmath12 mev is the average fermi energy and @xmath13 are coefficients . @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 is the gs density .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ eosvirial ] ) is the ( non relativistic ) kinetic energy of a free fermi gas which is unimportant at high densities .",
    "the other terms in the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eosvirial ] ) are the contributions from many - body interactions .",
    "the different @xmath17-cutoff in eq .",
    "( [ eosvirial ] ) results in different eos and different number of parameters to be fixed from known properties .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eosvirial ] ) is also referred to a virial expansion of the eos in terms of density .",
    "the difference is that in lt a pt is assumed and the density is an order parameter .",
    "the lt does not specify if the pt is from nuclear to quark phase or hyperons , but simply that there is a pt .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters , the pt could be first , second order or a simple cross - over .",
    "experiments or theoretical considerations should give constraints to the parameter values .",
    "we use the known properties of symmetric nuclear matter at normal density to determine the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eosvirial ] ) , i.e. @xmath18 mev , @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 . when the number of coefficients is more than 3 , we need more conditions to pin down the coefficients . to do that , we assume there is a pt from nuclear matter to quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , or in general from phase a to phase b , at high density with the conditions @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pressure , @xmath23 .",
    "these conditons imply a first ( @xmath24 ) or a second ( @xmath25 ) order pt for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite . in the case of a first order",
    "pt we need to know the critical density otherwise the number of conditions will not be enough to fix the parameters entering the eos .",
    "the choice of a second order pt is just to have enough constraints for the parameters entering eq .",
    "( [ eosvirial ] ) .",
    "if future experimental data or theoretical considerations will point to a different type of pt and critical density , then the parameters might be adjusted to reproduce those results .",
    "when we stop the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eosvirial ] ) at @xmath26 or @xmath27 , we obtain @xmath28 which is unphysical since the matter would collapse at high densities .",
    "we obtain two eos dubbed ccs@xmath03 and ccs@xmath05 when @xmath29 , o(@xmath30 ) , and @xmath31 , o(@xmath32 ) , respectively @xcite . for these values",
    "we have a second order pt for symmetric nuclear matter at different values of the critical density , @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "experimentally , the value of the critical exponent @xmath35 is found .",
    "the ccs@xmath03 gives @xmath36 which corresponds to the `` mean field '' or `` classical '' value and ccs@xmath05 gives @xmath37 closer to experiments @xcite .",
    "we stress that the assumption of a second order pt is for simplicity since it gives enough constraints to determine the values of the parameters entering eq .",
    "( [ eosvirial ] ) and the critical density .",
    "a first order pt requires the knowledge at least of the value of the critical density , thus we need experimental constraints or lattice qcd calculations at high baryonic densities and zero temperature to fix the parameters .",
    "we can generalize lt for asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "for instance , we can define the total symmetry energy as @xmath38 where @xmath17 is a constant connecting with the many - body interaction and @xmath39 is the corresponding symmetry energy per nucleon . for infinite nuclear matter , i.e. assuming a constant density difference , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of nucleons , @xmath42 is the asymmetry order parameter @xcite .",
    "then the symmetry energy per nucleon is @xmath43 when @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the symmetry energy per nucleon is @xmath39 .",
    "if only two - body interactions are important , i.e. @xmath46 , the symmetry energy per nucleon is @xmath47 thus , the usually used form of the symmetry energy is recovered with the definition eq .",
    "( [ sdef ] ) @xcite .",
    "notice that the asymmetry order parameter enters to a higher power than the density order parameter , we will see some consequences of this later .    adopting the symmetry energy per nucleon from eq .",

    "( [ eosvirial ] ) for asymmetric nuclear matter : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are unknowns .",

    "<S> a general formula of the symmetry energy for many - body interaction is proposed and the commonly used two - body interaction symmetry energy is recovered . within landau s theory ( lt ) , we generalize two equations of state ( eos ) ccs@xmath03 and ccs@xmath05 to asymmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the density and density difference between protons and neutrons divided by their sum are order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we use different eos to study neutron stars by solving the tov equations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that different eos give different mass and radius relation for neutron stars even when they have exactly the same ground state ( gs ) properties ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for one eos we change @xmath6 and fix all the other gs parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for some @xmath6 the eos becomes unstable at high density even for neutron matter . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a neutron star ( ns ) can exist below and above the instability region but in different states : a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high density and baryonic matter at low density . </S>",
    "<S> if the star s central density is in the instability region , then we associate these conditions to the occurrence of supernovae ( sn ) .    </S>",
