    "the 4-sphere system is a genuinely three - dimensional billiard where the systematic periodic orbit search is a nontrivial task . in this section",
    "we first develop the symbolic dynamics of orbits and the symmetry reduction using the tetrahedra group , and then discuss the numerical periodic orbit search and the calculation of the periodic orbit parameters .",
    "the 4-sphere system discussed here consists of four equal spheres with radius @xmath1 centered at the corners of a regular tetrahedron .",
    "we choose @xmath2 in what follows .",
    "the system is then solely determined by the center - to - center - separation @xmath3 .",
    "the 4-sphere system with large center - to - center - separation @xmath4 and with touching spheres ( @xmath5 ) are shown in fig .",

    "all combinations of the letters @xmath7 correspond to a physical orbit , with the exception that two consecutive letters in the itinerary code can not be identical and , for short center - to - center - separation @xmath8 , some orbits may be excluded by pruning ( see sec .  [ pruning : sec ] ) .",
    "several itinerary code strings may represent the same periodic orbit or a similar orbit obtained by a symmetry operation , i.e. , rotation or reflection .",
    "for example , the itinerary codes @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to the same periodic orbit by cyclic permutations , and the orbits @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 can be mapped onto each other by rotations .    by using the symmetry properties @xmath0 of the tetrahedron the system can be reduced to its fundamental domain .",
    "the symmetry reduced orbits can be described by a ternary alphabet of symbols ` 0 ' , ` 1 ' , and ` 2 ' , which are the three fundamental orbits , i.e. , the symmetry reductions of the shortest orbits scattered between two , three , and four spheres , respectively .",
    "therefore , we shall use the symbol ` 0 ' for returning back to the previous sphere after one reflection , symbol ` 1 ' for the reflection to the other third sphere in the same reflection plane of the orbit , and symbol ` 2 ' for the reflection to the other forth sphere out of the reflection plane of the orbit .",
    "the reflection plane is defined by the centers of the first three _ different _ spheres toward back in the history of the itinerary code of the orbit .",
    "the primitive periodic orbits of cycle length @xmath14 in the fundamental domain are now given by those periodic sequences of @xmath14 symbols ` 0 ' , ` 1 ' , and ` 2 ' which are free of subcycles ( e.g.  the code @xmath15 with subcycle @xmath16 is not primitive , we will neglect the line indicating periodicity in the following ) .",
    "the periodic orbits do not change by cyclic permutations of the code .",
    "we will choose the code word with the lowest numerical value as the representative ( e.g.  0112 instead of 1120 ) .",
    "with these rules every symmetry reduced periodic orbit of the 4-sphere system is uniquely described by a symbolic code . however , at small separations of the spheres",
    "some physical orbits are pruned as discussed below in sec .",
    "[ pruning : sec ] .    from the @xmath17 code of the symmetry reduced orbits the @xmath7 itinerary code can be obtained as follows .",
    "we choose the plane spanned by the spheres @xmath18 as the initial reflection plane and start the journey with the sequence @xmath19 .",
    "then the rules given above are applied for the symbols 0 , 1 , and 2 to guide the orbit to the subsequent spheres .",
    "note that symbolic codes which contain only the symbols ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' lie in the two - dimensional @xmath18-plane , i.e. , they correspond to the set of orbits with a binary symbolic code , which has been well - established for the 3-disk @xcite and 3-sphere system @xcite .",

    "the semiclassical resonances of the 4-sphere system are given by the poles of the function @xmath27 .",
    "however , it is well known that the periodic orbit sum ( [ g_k ] ) does not converge in those regions where the physical poles are located , and special techniques must be applied to obtain an analytical continuation of the periodic orbit sum ( [ g_k ] ) . for the 3-disk system with large center - to - center separation @xmath28 the cycle - expansion method @xcite and harmonic inversion techniques",
    "@xcite have proven to be powerful approaches for overcoming the convergence problems of the periodic orbit sum , and both methods can also be successfully applied to the 4-sphere system . however , when pruning of orbits sets in at small separations , and in particular in the case of touching disks or spheres , the situation is much more difficult and subtle , since the direct application of the cycle - expansion method fails .",
    "the two - dimensional closed 3-disk billiard is a bound system , where a few semiclassical eigenenergies have been obtained in ref .  @xcite using the cycle - expansion in combination with a functional equation .",
    "this method is not valid for open systems and can not be extended to the 4-sphere system which remains open even in the case of touching spheres @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the harmonic inversion of cross - correlated periodic orbit signals @xcite has been successfully applied to the closed 3-disk system @xcite and this method will also serve as a powerful tool for the three - dimensional 4-sphere system .",

    "the method of semiclassical quantization by harmonic inversion of cross - correlated periodic orbit signals is a generalization of the quantization scheme presented in sec .",
    "[ hi : sec ] .",
    "the idea is to use the classical average values of a set of linearly independent classical observables to construct a cross - correlated signal , whose informational content is significantly increased as compared to the one - dimensional signal , and therefore should lead to semiclassical spectra with improved resolution .",
    "the numerical tools for the harmonic inversion of cross - correlated periodic orbit signals have already been well established @xcite , and therefore we only briefly review the basic ideas and refer the reader to the literature for details . for simplicity but",
    "without loss of generality , we focus on billiard systems , where the shape of the orbits is independent of the energy @xmath42 , and the classical action of orbits reads @xmath43 , with @xmath32 the wave number and @xmath44 the physical length . the starting point is to introduce a weighted response function in terms of @xmath32 @xmath45 where @xmath40 is the eigenvalue of the wave number of eigenstate @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the diagonal matrix elements of a chosen set of @xmath48 linearly independent operators @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",

    "the numerical tool for this procedure is an extension of the harmonic inversion method to the signal processing of cross - correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the cross - correlation approach is based on the realization that the total amount of independent information contained in the @xmath51 signal is @xmath60 multiplied by the length of the signal , while the total number of unknowns ( here @xmath61 and @xmath40 ) is @xmath62 times the total number of poles @xmath40 .",

    "the real parts of the semiclassical resonances agree well with the real parts of the exact quantum mechanical resonances marked by the squares in fig .",
    "the agreement between the imaginary parts is , however , less perfect .",
    "some quantum resonances in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] do not have a semiclassical counterpart .",
    "those resonances with @xmath143 are probably related to the diffraction of waves at the spheres as discussed above , i.e. , they can not be explained without extensions of the semiclassical theories applied in this paper .      for the 4-sphere system as an example of a physical system with three degrees of freedom we now wish to discuss and compare the efficiency of the semiclassical and quantum computations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction ( sec .",
    "[ intro : sec ] ) the efficiency of quantum computations usually decreases rapidly with the number of degrees of freedom of the physical system .",
    "it is an interesting and important question whether semiclassical methods can beat the efficiency of quantum computations with increasing dimension of the problem .",
    "although there is not much hope and evidence that this is generally true , because of the exponential proliferation of periodic orbits in chaotic systems , it can be true for certain specific systems .",
    "an example for the superiority of semiclassical over quantum mechanical calculations is the 4-sphere system with large sphere separation , e.g.   @xmath28 , where semiclassical resonances can easily be obtained even in energy regions which are out of reach for the presently known quantum techniques @xcite . to understand this it is instructive to study the expense and scaling properties of the quantum and classical computations for the 3-disk and 4-sphere system .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ qm : sec ] exact quantum resonances of the 3-disk and 4-sphere systems can be obtained as roots of eqs .",
    "( [ m_3disk ] ) and ( [ m_4sphere ] ) , respectively , with angular quantum numbers truncated at @xmath93 .",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath94 in ( [ m_4sphere ] ) is much more expensive than for the matrix elements @xmath69 in ( [ m_3disk ] ) .",
    "however , the serious problem of solving eq .",
    "( [ m_4sphere ] ) is the scaling of the dimension of the matrix @xmath94 , which is an @xmath51 matrix with @xmath144 , i.e. , @xmath48 scales as @xmath100 for the 4-sphere system , as compared to @xmath101 for the 3-disk system , eq .",
    "( [ m_3disk ] ) . for example , in the region @xmath102 the required matrix dimension is @xmath103 for the 3-disk as compared to @xmath104 for the 4-sphere system . with currently available computer technology",
    "it is , therefore , impossible to significantly extend the quantum calculations for the 4-sphere system to the region @xmath145 using eqs .",
    "( [ m_4sphere]-[c_def ] ) .",
    "note that the cost of the quantum computations does not depend on the separation @xmath3 between the disks or spheres .    the expense of the semiclassical quantization is basically given by the required number of periodic orbits which , in chaotic systems , increases exponentially with the symbolic or physical length of the orbits .",
    "for the 3-disk system the number of symmetry reduced primitive periodic orbits with symbol length @xmath14 is given approximately by @xmath146 whereas it scales as @xmath147 for the 4-sphere system .",
    "contrary to the quantum computations the numerical expense for the semiclassical quantization , i.e. , the required number of orbits depends on the separation @xmath3 between the disks or spheres . for large separation @xmath28",
    "the cycle - expansion method is most efficient for the calculation of a large number of resonances .",
    "the reason is that the assumption of the cycle - expansion that the contributions of longer periodic orbits in the expansion of the gutzwiller - voros zeta function ( [ z_gv ] ) are shadowed by pseudo - orbits composed of shorter periodic orbits is very well fulfilled .",
    "the harmonic inversion method also allows for the calculation of a large number of resonances , but requires a larger input set of periodic orbits .",
    "while for the two - dimensional 3-disk system the semiclassical and quantum computations are very efficient , the semiclassical methods are superior to the quantum techniques for the three - dimensional 4-sphere system .",
    "the semiclassical calculations can easily be extended to the region @xmath148 where no quantum results are available because of the unfavorable scaling of the dimension of the matrix @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ m_4sphere ] ) . of course , a more efficient quantum method for the 4-sphere system than that of ref .",
    "@xcite may in principle exist .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge no such method has been proposed in the literature to date .",
    "the 4-sphere system therefore is an example of a three - dimensional system where semiclassical methods are presently superior to exact quantum calculations .    at reduced separation @xmath105 between the disks or spheres the semiclassical quantization requires an increased set of periodic orbits to achieve convergence of the cycle - expansion or harmonic inversion analysis .",
    "however , for the 4-sphere system the semiclassical methods are still superior to the exact quantum computations , i.e. , semiclassical resonances can be obtained in regions which are unattainable with the quantum methods as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the situation is different for touching spheres , @xmath5 , which is a challenging system not only for the quantum but also for the semiclassical computations .",
    "the construction of a long periodic orbit signal is impossible because orbits with increasing sequences of consecutive ` 0 ' symbols in the code lead to accumulation points in the physical length similar as for the closed 3-disk system @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical calculations for the touching spheres are therefore at least about the same or even more expensive than the quantum computations .",
    "in summary , we have investigated an open system with three degrees of freedom , viz .",
    "the 4-sphere scattering problem with various sphere separations by means of classical , semiclassical , and quantum mechanical methods .",
    "the classical system has genuinely three - dimensional periodic orbits . in the symmetry",
    "reduced fundamental domain , they can be associated to a ternary symbolic alphabet , which allows for a systematic periodic orbit search . for large separations between the spheres ( @xmath150 ) semiclassical resonances",
    "have been obtained by application of the cycle - expansion technique and the harmonic inversion method . for touching spheres ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the symbolic dynamics is pruned and the cycle - expansion does not converge , however , some semiclassical resonances can be revealed by harmonic inversion of a cross - correlated periodic orbit signal .",
    "exact quantum mechanical resonances have also been calculated , however , the quantum computations for the three - dimensional 4-sphere system are much more expensive than for the two - dimensional analogue , viz .  the 3-disk scattering problem .",
    "therefore , the quantum computations had to be restricted to the region with relatively low wave numbers , i.e. , @xmath151 . by analyzing the scaling properties of both the quantum and semiclassical calculations we have demonstrated the superiority of semiclassical methods over quantum computations at least for large sphere separations , i.e.",
    ", semiclassical resonances can easily be obtained in energy regions which at present are unattainable with the established quantum method .",
    "these results may encourage the investigation of other systems with three or more degrees of freedom with the goal of developing powerful semiclassical techniques , which are competitive with or even superior to quantum computations for a large variety of systems .    in those regions where exact quantum results for the 4-sphere system are lacking an assessment of the accuracy of the semiclassical resonances",
    "is presently impossible .",
    "higher - order @xmath127 corrections have been calculated for two - dimensional billiard systems @xcite , however , the extension of the theory to three - dimensional systems is a nontrivial task for future work .",
    "those quantum resonances which are related to diffraction of waves at the spheres have not yet been explained semiclassically . for the 3-disk system",
    "diffractive resonances have been obtained with an extended periodic orbit theory by including the contributions of creeping orbits @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to generalize these ideas to the genuinely three - dimensional 4-sphere system .",
