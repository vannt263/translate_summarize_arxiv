    "the observed rich clusters of galaxies are believed to have formed through the gravitational collapse of the highest local peaks of the initial density field @xcite .",
    "although most of the rich clusters belong to the larger - scale superclusters ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there exist few isolated massive clusters which reside in relatively low - density environments without having any close neighbor clusters . the relative abundance of the isolated clusters should depend on how strong the gravitational clustering is on the largest scale and how frequently the clusters merge into the superclusters in the universe .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the relative abundance of the isolated massive clusters may be useful to distinguish between different candidate dark energy models .    to predict the relative abundance of isolated clusters in different dark energy models ,",
    "however , a theoretical framework is first required within which the number density of isolated clusters can be separately counted .",
    "the standard excursion set formalism has been conventionally employed to analytically calculate the number density of galaxy clusters as a function of mass , i.e. , the mass function of galaxy clusters .",
    "basically , the standard excursion set formalism counts the initial regions whose linearly extrapolated density contrast ( @xmath4 ) exceeds a fixed threshold value ( @xmath5 ) on a certain mass scale @xmath6 , regarding them as the sites which would eventually collapse to form the bound objects of mass @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the density threshold @xmath5 which is often called the _ collapse barrier _ has a constant value of @xmath7 if the gravitational collapse process follows the spherical dynamics @xcite .",
    "@xcite have for the first time introduced the concept of the stochastic collapse barrier to generalize the excursion set formalism . in the light of the numerical result of @xcite , @xcite regarded the collapse barrier , @xmath5 , as a log - normal variable , and showed that in the high - mass limit the collapse barrier has a spherical average of @xmath8 .",
    "very recently , @xcite have made a further refinement of the mass function theory by incorporating the ellipsoidal collapse dynamics into the generalized excursion set formalism .",
    "they extended the generalized excursion set formalism to the case that the mean collapse barrier , @xmath9 , deviates from the spherical average , @xmath7 in the low - mass limit .",
    "the higher collapse barrier than the spherical average , @xmath10 , corresponds to the case that the formation of the low - mass halos experience the disturbing tidal effect from the surroundings .",
    "we note here that the corasaniti - achitouv formalism should be applicable not only to the case that the gravitational collapse occurs non - spherically in the low - mass section but also to the case that the massive halos form in isolated low - density environments .",
    "given that the massive cluster - size halos are likely to form in the highly overdense regions but hardly in the isolated low - density regions , the collapse barrier for the formation of the isolated clusters should be higher than the spherical average . since the corasaniti - achitouv formalism allows the average collapse barrier to deviate from the spherical value of @xmath11 , their formalism may be capable of deriving the mass function of the isolated clusters .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly review the corasaniti - achitouv formalism of the halo mass function . in ",
    "3 we explain how the relative abundance of the isolated clusters can be evaluated by modifying the corasaniti - achitouv formalism and present the results of the numerical tests . in ",
    "4 we show how sensitively the relative abundance of the isolated clusters depends on the dark energy equation of state as well as the other key cosmological parameters .",

    "* ) , the collapse barrier is described not as a constant but as a function of the mass scale @xmath6 ( or equivalently , a function of the rms density fluctuation , @xmath16 ) .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mr10 ) pointed out that not only the constant spherical collapse barrier but also the scale - dependent ellipsoidal collapse barrier is incapable of describing the true nature of the complicated halo formation process and suggested that the collapse barrier @xmath5 should be treated as a stochastic variable .",
    "mr10 derived an analytic expression for the halo mass function by generalizing the excursion set formalism for the case that the collapse barrier is stochastic and the random walk process is non - markovian .",
    "it was shown by mr10 that in the high - mass limit ( @xmath29 ) the average of the stochastic collapse barrier equals the constant spherical value , @xmath8 and its variance is scale - dependent as @xmath30 where @xmath1 is called the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the stochasticity of the collapse barrier is caused by the disturbance from the surroundings and the ambiguity in the halo - identification procedure ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the non - zero value of this drifting average coefficient , @xmath0 , quantifies the degree of the deviation of the average of the collapse barrier from the spherical average @xmath11 , while the non - zero value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 quantifies the degree of the stochasticity of the collapse barrier @xmath5 .",
    "the ca11 multiplicity function @xmath14 was written at second order as @xmath32 where @xmath33,\\\\ \\label{eqn : f1b1 } f^{(1)}_{\\beta}(\\sigma;d_{b})&= & -\\beta\\,a\\,\\delta_{sc}\\left[f^{(1)}_{\\beta=0}(\\sigma)+\\tilde{\\kappa}\\ , \\textrm{erfc}\\left(x\\right)\\right],\\\\ \\label{eqn : f1b2 } f^{(1)}_{\\beta^2}(\\sigma;d_{b})&=&\\beta^{2}a^{2}\\delta^{2}_{sc}\\tilde{\\kappa } \\biggl\\{\\textrm{erfc}\\left(x\\right)+ \\frac{\\sigma}{a\\delta_{sc}}\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2\\pi}}\\biggl[e^{-\\frac{a\\delta_{sc}^2 } { 2\\sigma^2}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-2x\\right)+\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{a\\delta_{sc}^2 } { \\sigma^2}\\gamma\\left(0,x\\right)\\biggr]\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and incomplete gamma function @xmath38 . here",
    ", @xmath39 coincides with the mr10 multiplicity function which has only one parameter @xmath1 .",
    "computing the halo mass functions through equations ( [ eqn : mft])-([eqn : f1b2 ] ) and comparing them with the fitting formula given by @xcite , ca11 have determined the best - fit values of the two coefficients as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "ca11 have also shown how the shape of the halo mass function changes with the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "according to their results , the variation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 alters the high - end slope of @xmath14 while the variation of the drifting average coefficient @xmath0 affects the over - all amplitude of @xmath14 .",
    "now , we would like to confirm the validity of the ca11 mass function by testing it against the high - resolution mice simulations @xcite which traced the evolution of @xmath42 dark matter particles ( each having mass of @xmath43 ) on a periodic box with linear size of @xmath44gpc for a @xmath24cdm cosmology .",
    "we utilize the publicly available catalog of the cluster halos that were identified via the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm .",
    "the catalog provides information on each halo s ( comoving ) position , peculiar velocity and fof mass ( calculated as the sum of the masses of all the dark matter particles belonging to each halo ) at three different redshifts : @xmath45 . for a detailed description of the mice simulations and the cluster catalogs , we refer the readers to @xcite .    binning the logarithmic masses of the cluster halos from the mice catalog and counting the number densities of the cluster halos belonging to each logarithmic mass - bin",
    ", we obtain the numerical mass function of all cluster halos , @xmath46 , at each redshift . fitting the ca11 formula ( eqs [ [ eqn : mft]]-[[eqn : f1b2 ] ] ) to the numerical results from the mice simulations at each redshift , we have determined the best - fit values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the help of the @xmath47 statistics , the results of which are listed in table [ tab : best1 ] .",
    "note that the diffusion coefficient , @xmath1 , has the same best - fit value of @xmath48 at all three redshifts while the best - fit value of the drifting average coefficient , @xmath0 , increases as the redshift decreases .",
    "the result indicates that at earlier epochs the gravitational collapse process is closer to the spherical dynamics than at present epoch .",
    "since a bound halo is harder to form at earlier epochs , those high-@xmath20 halos must correspond to higher peaks in the initial density field . as shown analytically by @xcite ,",
    "the higher a local density peak is , the more spherically its gravitational collapse proceeds .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that our result on the best - fit value of @xmath49 is different from the original value @xmath50 used in the ca11 formalism .",
    "this discrepancy must be due to the fact that we use the fof masses available in the mice catalog while the spherical over - density ( so ) masses were considered in the original ca11 work .",
    "figure [ fig : dndm ] plots the ca11 mass functions with the best - fit values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( solid line ) and compare them with the numerical results from the mice simulations ( square dots ) at @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the top - left , top - middle and top - right panels , respectively .",
    "the jackknife method is employed to calculate the errors : dividing the halos into eight subsamples ( each having the same number of the halos ) and determining @xmath46 separately from each subsample , the errors are calculated as one @xmath16 scatter of @xmath46 among the eight jackknife resamples .",
    "figure [ fig : dndm ] also plots the ratio of the analytic mass function to the numerical result as a function of mass at @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the bottom - left , bottom - middle and bottom - right panel , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the analytical and numerical mass functions agree with each other quite at all three redshifts , except in the high - mass section ( @xmath53 ) where the jackknife errors are very large .",
    "applying the fof algorithm with the linkage length parameter of @xmath54 to the mice cluster catalogs at each redshift , we first find the clusters of clusters ( i.e. , superclusters ) which have more than one neighbor clusters within the fof linkage length , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mean cluster separation .",
    "the _ isolated clusters _ are then identified as those clusters which do not belong to any superclusters . note that the degree of their isolation depends on the value of @xmath54 : the larger the value of @xmath54 is , the more isolated they are . here",
    "we consider the extreme case in which the isolated clusters experience no disturbance from the surrounding large - scale structures and the difference between their fof and so masses is negligible . in this extreme case ,",
    "the value of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath1 , must vanish since the non - zero value of @xmath1 indicates the presence of the disturbance from the surroundings and the existence of the difference between the fof and so masses .",
    "the ad - hoc value of the linkage length parameter for this extreme case is determined to be @xmath57 by the following procedures .",
    "we first investigate how the best - fit value of @xmath1 changes as the value of @xmath54 varies from @xmath58 to @xmath59 in the fof algorithm applied to the mice cluster catalogs .",
    "for each case of @xmath54 , we select the isolated clusters from the mice cluster catalog and obtain the numerical mass function of the isolated clusters .",
    "then , we fit the numerical result to the analytic ca11 formula ( eq.[[eqn : mft]]-[[eqn : f1b2 ] ] ) to determine the best - fit values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 with the help of the @xmath47 statistics .",
    "figure [ fig : bdb ] plots the best - fit value of @xmath1 versus the linkage length parameter @xmath54 .",

    "this result indicates that the ca11 formula with @xmath2 indeed works fairly well for the determination of the mass function of the isolated clusters .",

    "<S> those galaxy clusters which do not belong to the superclusters are referred to as the isolated clusters . </S>",
    "<S> their relative abundance at a given epoch may be a powerful constraint of the dark energy equation of state since it depends strongly on how fast the structures grow on the largest scale in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the mass function of the isolated clusters can be separately evaluated through the modification of the recently developed corasaniti - achitouv ( ca ) theory according to which the stochastic collapse barrier is quantified by two coefficients : the drifting average coefficient ( @xmath0 ) and the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> regarding @xmath0 in the ca formalism as an adjustable parameter and assuming that the formation of isolated clusters corresponds to the case of @xmath2 , we determine the mass function of the isolated clusters by fitting the numerical results from the mice simulations to the modified ca formula . it is found that the best - fit value of @xmath0 changes with redshift and that the ca mass function with @xmath2 agrees very well with the numerical results at various redshifts . defining the relative abundance of the isolated clusters , @xmath3 , as the ratio of the cumulative mass function of the isolated clusters to that of the non - isolated clusters at a given epoch , we finally show how sensitively @xmath3 changes with the dark energy equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> it is also discussed how @xmath3 can help to break the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and the other key cosmological parameters . </S>"
