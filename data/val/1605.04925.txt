    "the host galaxies of superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) type i are generally faint dwarf galaxies @xcite which tend to have low gas - phase metallicities @xcite , and high specific star - formation rates ( @xmath2 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is currently a debate in the literature as to which of these two properties is the key requirement for slsn - progenitor formation .",
    "evidence for _ low - metallicity _ being the primary driver comes from @xcite , who found the host galaxy of sn  2010gx to have a very low oxygen abundance of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 on the @xmath5 scale ) .",
    "the high quality host galaxy spectrum enabled a detection of the [ oiii ] 4363  line , providing a reliable `` direct '' method estimate of the oxygen abundance for the first time for any such slsn host .",
    "this is still the lowest metallicity for any supernova ( or low - redshift gamma - ray - burst , grb ) host galaxy measured to date .",
    "it is known from theory and observation that low - metallicity environments lead to more compact , faster rotating massive stars with weaker stellar winds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may favour magnetar formation , which is a viable proposed central engine model for slsne as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the application of this model shows good quantitative agreement with observations of slsne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a sn associated with an ultra - long grb @xcite . in the first of the large sample papers , @xcite proposed that the hosts of slsne type i share the same low metallicity ( sub - solar abundance ) preference as long - duration grb ( lgrb ) host galaxies .",
    "in fact , slsne type i could require even lower - metallicity environments than lgrbs ( @xcite ) . that the host galaxies of slsne type i are consistently fainter than those of lgrbs is supported by hst imaging @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption features may also indicate different environments for slsne and grbs .",
    "@xcite proposed that high ssfr is the primary driver to produce slsne , and they found that half of their slsn hosts are extreme - emission - line galaxies ( @xmath6galaxies exhibiting emission lines with ew @xmath7 ) .",
    "they suggested that the progenitors of slsne constitute the first generation of stars to explode in a starburst , therefore being even younger and more massive , than the progenitors of lgrbs .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have instead suggested that slsn type i progenitors are older and less massive stars than those of lgrbs .",
    "this is based on the locations of slsne type i within their hosts , which show less of a preference for the brightest regions of the host galaxy when compared to lgrbs .",
    "another potential argument is that some slsn host galaxies have been observed with possible high metallicities , which questions the proposal that low metallicity is a key requirement .",
    "for example , one of the most metal - rich host galaxies of a slsn type i is mls121104 @xcite , with 12 + log ( o / h ) = 8.8 ( @xmath8 scale , @xcite ; hereafter kk04 ) .",
    "however the sn location is clearly offset from the host centre , and further investigation is required to determine if this is indeed the host , or if the metallicity at the sn position is the same as that of the observed galaxy .",
    "also , the metallicity estimate needs verification with the detection of the [ ] @xmath9  line .",
    "we note here that ssfr itself can not be a direct physical cause of slsn progenitor formation , as a star - forming region can not know about the total sfr or integrated star - formation history ( @xmath6@xmath10 ) of the whole host galaxy .",
    "therefore , for this interpretation to be valid , ssfr must instead be indicative of a more physical property .",
    "for example , a high ssfr could indicate a young stellar population , which could therefore contain massive stars capable of forming slsne ( @xmath11as proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , a top - heavy stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has been proposed for star - bursting regions in ultra - compact dwarf galaxies @xcite . this would allow an increased number of massive stars to form in these environments , hence causing the preference for slsn to occur in high - ssfr galaxies .",
    "we would also note that adjusting the imf has no observational support from resolved studies of massive stars in local group or local universe galaxies , across a factors 5 - 10 in metallicity .    in this work ,",
    "we systematically compare the metallicity and star - formation properties of a sample of 16 slsn type i host galaxies against star - forming galaxies in the local universe , in order to better determine which is the most important parameter for producing slsn progenitors .",
    "we have compiled a sample of slsne type i host data either in our possession ( @xcite ; chen et al .",
    ", in prep . ) or published in the literature @xcite for all objects below @xmath12 .",
    "this adds up to a sample of 16 low-@xmath13 slsn type i host galaxies ( and an additional two hosts with only upper limits for their sfr ) .",
    "the sfr and stellar mass have been corrected to the same imf from @xcite .",
    "we have propagated all errors to obtain an overall uncertainty for each property .",
    "we also measure a detection limit for the line where there is no reported detection to estimate an upper limit for the sfr in these cases .",
    "those host properties are summarised in table[tab : host_data ] .",
    "we only consider slsn type i hosts below @xmath14 , with the argument that there should be only minor stellar - mass and metallicity evolution between @xmath15 ( the minimum redshift in our sample ) and @xmath14 .",
    "the difference in the cosmic star formation rate density between @xmath16 and @xmath17 using equation 15 in @xcite is only @xmath18 .",

    "this allows us to better identify the key property required to produce slsne type i. this local universe galaxy survey obtained h@xmath21 images ( @xmath6narrow - band photometry around the h@xmath21 line ) for 436 galaxies , including both dwarf and giant irregular / spiral star - forming galaxies , spanning a wide luminosity range of @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite give the h@xmath21 luminosities for those galaxies , which we use to estimate the sfr .",
    "these luminosities are corrected for milky way reddening but not for internal extinction .",
    "therefore , we have made our own internal dust extinction corrections using the balmer decrement ( h@xmath21/h@xmath23 ) for 13 galaxies @xcite within the 11 mpc catalogue finding a correlation between their average @xmath24 and their observed galaxy h@xmath21 luminosities of @xmath25 ( with a correlation of 0.70 and a @xmath26 scatter in @xmath24 of 0.6 mag ) .",
    "we use this relation to obtain extinctions for the remainder of the 11 mpc sample .",
    "negative values of @xmath24 are set to zero .",
    "we then employ the calibration of @xcite ( which assumes an imf of @xcite ) to estimate galaxy sfr from the extinction - corrected @xmath27 , and apply a further correction to convert to a chabrier imf by multiplying by a factor of 0.63 .",
    "stellar masses for the 11 mpc sample were obtained in a similar way .",
    "taking the stellar masses derived from 3.6um measurements of 210 galaxies within the 11 mpc sample @xcite , we fit our own relation between their metallicity ( n2 scale ) and stellar mass ( ): @xmath28 ( with a correlation of 0.93 and a @xmath26 scatter in @xmath10 of 0.4 dex ) .",
    "this relation is then used to obtain stellar mass estimates for the remainder of the sample .",
    "finally , we calculate the specific sfr for 384 of the galaxies within the 11 mpc sample .",

    "we estimated the ratio of [ n ii ] @xmath316583 and h@xmath21 by applying the theoretical ratio between the [ n ii ] lines at 6548 and 6583 of 1:3 , and then calculated their metallicities with the n2 scale .",
    "[ fig : sfr - z ] shows the relationship between sfr and metallicity ( n2 method ) for 16 low-@xmath13 slsn type i hosts from the literature ( red points , see section[sec : slsn hosts ] ) .",
    "the 11 mpc sample of local - volume galaxies is also shown for comparison ( blue ) .",
    "we use the pp04 n2 metallicity diagnostic for both slsn hosts and the 11 mpc sample in this work , so that we can fairly compare their relative metallicities .",
    "the n2 method is reliable in the low - metallicity regime where our slsn hosts are located .",
    "we can see that the most star - forming slsn hosts have significantly lower metallicities than local galaxies with similarly high sfrs .",
    "no slsn host in our sample has a measured metallicity higher than @xmath32 , which is roughly half the solar oxygen abundance [ assuming @xmath33 , @xcite ] . for comparison , measured oxygen abundances at the sn position of 12 normal type ic sne , and found that the metallicities of those hosts are all above 8.5 dex ( pp04 o3n2 scale , which is similar to n2 scale ) .",
    "[ fig : lum - sfr ] shows the relation between @xmath10 and sfr for the same two samples .",
    "slsn hosts are indeed more star - forming than typical local galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_n2 ] shows that most slsn hosts have comparable or lower metallicities than local galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "these systems are qualitatively consistent with the low - redshift fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr , @xcite ) , which suggests an anti - correlation between sfr and metallicity at low @xmath10 .",
    "however , two of our slsn hosts , ptf10hgi and lsq14mo ( and possibly also sn  2011kf ) , have metallcities _ higher _ than typical galaxies of the same mass ( though still below 8.4 , using the n2 method ) .",
    "this demonstrates that slsn only require progenitors with a metallicity below some _ absolute _ value , regardless of the typical metallicities found in galaxies of the same stellar mass .                turning our attention to the relative significance of low metallicity and high _ specific _ star - formation rate , we present the metallicity - ssfr relation in fig .",

    "even when only considering these low - metallicity systems , slsne still favour lower - metallicity star - forming regions than typically found in local galaxies .",
    "similarly , slsne are preferentially found in the highest ssfr galaxies , even when only comparing to the low metallicity ( @xmath35 dex ) local population .",
    "these two results suggest that slsne do not simply trace star formation in the local universe , but instead prefer both low - metallicity and high - ssfr environments .",
    "the probability ( assuming a binomial distribution ) that all of the 16 low-@xmath13 slsn type i hosts are in the low - metallicity bin simply by chance is only @xmath36 .",
    "the metallicity - ssfr parameter space has also been studied for a sample of @xmath37 emission - line galaxies from the sdss - dr7 by @xcite . while it is problematic to directly compare our slsn hosts with the sdss ,",
    "due to selection effects and differences in the way key parameters are calculated , we _ can _ use such samples to make qualitative statements about the type of galaxies which seem to host slsne .",
    "@xcite show that systems within the same range of ssfr and metallicity as our slsn hosts have low stellar masses , high gas fractions , and young ages , compared to typical star - forming galaxies in the local universe ( see their fig .",
    "from analogy to the munich semi - analytic model of galaxy evolution , l - galaxies , they also show that these systems gas - phase metallicities should be lower than their stellar metallicities ( see panel e of fig .",
    "3 ) , indicating that recent accretion of low - metallicity gas is fuelling current star formation .",

    "[ fig : z - radius ] shows a clear correlation between the host metallicity ( in this case , measured with the kk04 @xmath8 method , since the and [ ] lines are out of the observed wavelength range ) and slsn offset .",
    "more precisely , we can say that there are no slsne found near the centres of high - metallicity galaxies .",
    "systems with disturbed morphologies may contain low - metallicity pockets of gas where slsne could form or the true host galaxy may be kinematically distinct ( as in the case of lsq14mo , chen et al . in prep ) .",
    "@xcite showed that disk abundance gradients in spiral galaxies are common and universal when expressed in terms of effective radius , even down to absolute magnitudes of @xmath48 .",
    "this may also be an indicator that abundance variations are in play in lower luminosity galaxies , and indicates that the metallicity at a slsn site could be lower than the integrated measured value .",
    "therefore , even in galaxies with high integrated metallicities ( such as the host of ps1 - 12bqf at @xmath49 ) , a sub - solar metallicity could still be present at the offset slsn site .",

    ". crucially , there are no systems in the bottom - right region of the plot , indicating that no slsn in our sample have exploded near the centres of high - metallicity galaxies.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] , there are two dominant interpretations of current slsn - host data .",
    "the first is that low - metallicity is the main requirement for slsn formation .",
    "the second is that high ssfr is instead the main requirement . from the data presented in section [ sec : results ] we can not unambiguously distinguish between these two interpretations .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : z - ssfr ] demonstrates that both low metallicity and high ssfr are present in all of the slsn host galaxies sampled here .",
    "however , in this work , we suggest that low metallicity is a fundamental cause , whereas high ssfr is only a consequence of the low metallicity",
    ".    observations show a clear preference for slsne to occur in low metallicity environments , which implies low stellar mass host galaxies through the mass metallicity relation .",
    "we expect that slsne also require massive star progenitors , and thus they are more likely to arise in galaxies with elevated sfrs . combining these two factors",
    "gives rise to the observed high ssfr .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that there are many hosts that have weak ( e.g. the host of sn  2007bi ) , or undetected h@xmath21 lines .",
    "for example , we estimate the detection limit of fluxes from the slsn spectra , and find the host of lsq12dlf to have a detection limit of sfr @xmath51 0.004 yr@xmath52 , the host of sn  2013dg to have a detection limit of sfr @xmath51 0.003 yr@xmath52 , and the host of lsq14bdq to have a detection limit of sfr @xmath51 0.05 yr@xmath52 . these low sfr objects are not shown in figures due to the lack of information of other host properties ( e.g. unknown host metallicities and stellar masses ) .",
    "@xcite argued that mass is the key driver and that slsne type i are the very first stars to explode in a starburst , and thus the progenitors are very massive stars ( for specific object see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our data are not inconsistent with this interpretation , although we would point out that very high masses are not quantitatively constrained in either study .",
    "along with the very young stars that provide the extreme emission line ratios , virtually all hosts have stellar populations up to a few tens of myr old detected , as traced by the uv and optical continuum @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolutions that ground - based spectrographs probe at @xmath53 are typically more than 2 kpc , so a precise determination of the nature of progenitor stars is not yet possible . distinguishing between progenitors of @xmath010 - 20  and greater than 50",
    "is not easily achieved with the data .",
    "slsne are rare , and occur only at a rate of about 1 in 10,000 - 20,000 of the core - collapse population @xcite",
    ". it may be that a combination of very high mass ( as traced by high ssfr ) and low metallicity is required . or it could be that a high ssfr is just a consequence of star formation in low - metallicity environments .",
    "alternative scenarios that could produce low gas - phase metallicities in the slsn region , without requiring low @xmath10 , are ( a ) significant infall of pristine gas onto a previously higher - metallicity host galaxy , and ( b ) variations in metallicity within a host itself ( e.g. low - metallicity pockets or global metallicity gradients )",
    ". crucially , both these scenarios are consistent with the presence of a low integrated ssfr . therefore , with a larger sample of slsn host galaxies with measured ssfrs",
    ", we could break the degeneracy discussed above and confirm our interpretation that low - metallicity is the key driver .",
    "the identification of metallicity as the key parameter for forming slsne type i has important implications for determining the power source underlying the explosion itself .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , the magnetar model is one of the preferred scenarios for producing slsne .",
    "any link between galaxy environment and parameters of the powering mechanism would help elucidate not only progenitor star properties ( e.g. mass or metallicity ) but also the underlying mechanism producing slsne .",
    "we show a possible correlation between host metallicity and magnetar spin - down period in fig .  [",
    "fig : z - spin ] using the available data for eight slsn and their hosts .",
    "the magnetar spin - down period is derived from the slsn bolometric light curve and semi - analytic models for magnetar energy deposition ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two quantities are truly independent measurements .",
    "a simple spearman rank correlation analysis returns a coefficient @xmath54 .",
    "this corresponds to a null - hypothesis probability , that the observed correlation is the result of a statistical fluctuation , of @xmath55 .",
    "this is an unexpectedly clear correlation between two quite independent observational properties .",
    "however measurement uncertainties play an important role and we hence test the significance of the observed correlation using a sample of @xmath56 bootstrapped distributions . here , we vary the host metallicity according to the measurement errors and the spin - down period ( @xmath57 ) by an assumed systematic error of 0.2 dex .",
    "we fit a linear relation to each of the data sets .",
    "the median of the resulting posterior distribution is obtained at @xmath58 .",
    "this best fit , and the area in which 68 per cent of all iterations are located , is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : z - spin ] .",
    "no dependence of spin - down period on host metallicity is observed in only @xmath59 of all cases .",
    "a positive correlation is also found when using the @xmath60 and kk04 @xmath8 metallicity diagnostics , with errors consistent with the n2-metallicity based data , although the relations obtained are somewhat steeper and have a slightly larger scatter .",
    "the relation between the magnetar spin - down period and the host metallicity indicates that faster rotating magnetars reside in more metal - poor environments .",
    "theory predicts that low metallicity massive stars are more compact and have a reduced mass loss , which results in faster rotation @xcite this may lead to chemically - homogeneous evolution which allows massive stars to retain more angular moment and thus rotate faster , even during the wolf rayet stage @xcite .",
    "observationally , massive stars with smc metallicity ( @xmath61 ) appear to rotate more rapidly than those with solar metallicity @xcite and the difference may also be visible at lmc metallicites .",
    "further work needs to be done to determine if stellar structure models including metallicity - dependent rotation can account quantitatively for faster - spinning magnetic neutron stars after core - collapse . if the observed relation shown in fig.[fig : z - spin ] holds true , it would strongly support the magnetar scenario , as it is not clear how the alternative slsn progenitor models could bring about an equivalent relation between host galaxy metallicity , and light curve shape and peak luminosity .",
    "pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) also require low metallicity @xcite , in order to maintain a sufficiently massive helium core to explode in this manner . however , low metallicity is necessary ( but not sufficient in itself ) to interpret slsne as pisne .",
    "most slsne type i show light curves that are clearly inconsistent with being pisn @xcite .",
    "the slowly - declining events , which have been claimed to be pisn candidates @xcite , seem to have similar hosts to the fast decaying events .",
    "they have been interpreted as simply the high - mass counterparts of the fast - declining slsne @xcite and we find no distinction here in their host properties .",
    "the slowly declining objects are sn  2007bi , lsq14an , ptf12dam , and sn  2015bn and these do not appear significantly different to the rest of the sample in any plots .",
    "comparing the metallicity , ssfr and sn offset for a sample of 16 slsn type i host galaxies we have found perhaps the strongest evidence yet that low metallicity is a key parameter for forming slsne type i. if slsne simply followed sfr in the local universe , we would expect to see many more at high metallicity , where the bulk of star formation occurs .",
    "instead , we find that slsn trace regions of significantly lower metallicity and higher ssfr than those typically found in local galaxies .",
    "we suggest that the presence of high ssfr is a consequence of ( a ) the anti - correlation between gas - phase metallicity and ssfr and ( b ) the requirement of on - going star formation for massive stellar progenitors to form and to produce slsne .",
    "we propose that current evidence supports a metallicity cutoff of about @xmath62 , above which we do not find any slsne type i in our sample .",
    "low metallicity may favour a magnetar ( central engine ) model , in which reduced mass - loss helps to maintain high angular momentum at core - collapse .",
    "we find a surprisingly clear trend for the derived magnetar spin period ( from supernova lightcurve fitting ) to be correlated with metallicity .",
    "the slsne from lower metallicity galaxies require magnetars which have shorter spin periods .",
    "while this needs further investigation , the correlation supports both a low metallicity requirement for progenitor stars and the model of magnetar powering .",

    "<S> host galaxy properties provide strong constraints on the stellar progenitors of superluminous supernovae . by comparing a sample of 16 low - redshift superluminous supernova hosts to a volume - limited galaxy population in the local universe , </S>",
    "<S> we show that sub - solar metallicities seems to be a requirement . </S>",
    "<S> all superluminous supernovae in hosts with high measured gas - phase metallicities are found to explode at large galactocentric radii , indicating that the metallicity at the explosion site is likely lower than the integrated host value . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that high specific star - formation rates are a feature of superluminous supernova host galaxies , but interpret this as simply a consequence of the anti - correlation between gas - phase metallicity and specific star - formation rate and the requirement of on - going star formation to produce young , massive stars greater than @xmath010 - 20 . based on our sample </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an upper limit of @xmath1 for forming superluminous supernova progenitors ( assuming an n2 metallicity diagnostic and a solar oxygen abundance of 8.69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that if magnetar powering is the source of the extreme luminosity then the required initial spins appear to be correlated with metallicity of the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation needs further work , but if it holds it is a powerful link between the supernova parameters and nature of the progenitor population .    </S>",
