    "in the description of the fundamental interactions among elementary particles , symmetries play a central role , more important than particles themselves .",
    "the diversity of particles and/or of their interactions can actually be often understood , in a way or another , as a manifestation of the underlying basic symmetries .",
    "as we know , three kinds of symmetries are or may be of relevance in these respects : space - time symmetries , intra - family ( vertical ) symmetries , inter - family ( horizontal or flavour ) symmetries .",
    "there is clear evidence for space - time symmetries , which might include supersymmetry , as there is compelling evidence for the vertical su(3,2,1 ) gauge symmetry . on the contrary , the role and",
    "the nature of flavour symmetries is still controvertial .",
    "unified theories can mostly be viewed as attempts to enlarge the role of these symmetries in the description of elementary particle physics .",
    "there is , in fact , circumstantial evidence in favour of an enlargement of the vertical su(3,2,1 ) gauge symmetry to a more unified group , like su(5 ) or bigger .",
    "such evidence is both of algebric and of empirical nature .",
    "the quantum numbers of the quarks and leptons of one generation fit into simple representations of the unified group , as observed more than twenty years ago  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the more recent precise measurements of the weak mixing angle @xmath0 and of the strong coupling constant @xmath1 indicate their meeting with the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath2 at a large energy scale @xmath3  @xcite , provided the `` low energy '' spectrum includes the new particles implied by supersymmetry  @xcite : to make a larger vertical symmetry working calls for an enlargement of the space - time symmetry , including supersymmetry , as also demanded by the need to stabilize the huge hierarchy between the weak and the unification scales .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , which shows the prediction for @xmath1 as function of an appropriately defined `` mean '' supersymmetric mass  @xcite , @xmath4 , ranging between @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 in the `` natural '' region of parameter space .",
    "the band of the `` susy gut '' prediction corresponds to what i think is a reasonable definition of the theoretical uncertainties associated with physics occurring at the high energy scale , like heavy thresholds  @xcite and/or planck scale non renormalizable effects  @xcite by about @xmath8  @xcite ] .",
    "the agreement of such prediction with the current world average , @xmath9  @xcite , is remarkable . on the other hand",
    ", this figure makes clear that the unification of couplings does not set an upper bound on the scale of supersymmetric particle masses relevant to their foreseable experimental search . on the contrary",
    ", it determines with significant precision the value of the unification scale .",
    "( 15.5,9 )    = 1 ( 0,0 )    ( 0,1 )    fig",
    ". 1 also shows the central value of the `` string theory prediction '' , defined by requiring , with the same spectrum as in the `` susy gut '' case , the meeting of the three couplings at the string scale @xmath10  @xcite with an arbitrary kac moody coefficient for the hypercharge u(1 ) factor . the discrepancy between @xmath11 and @xmath3 , as determined by fig . 1 itself ,",
    "is the source of the problem . by no means",
    ", however , this must be viewed as a conflict between field theory and string theory .",
    "string theory , which actually forces unification of the gauge couplings also with the gravitational coupling , can still require @xmath1 to be in agreement with the observed value in several ways .",
    "at least three such ways have been put forward : i ) a stage of grand unification , in the usual field theory sense , below the string scale  @xcite is the one of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ] ; ii ) a modification of space - time below the gut scale which influences the energy dependence of the gravitational constant but not of the gauge couplings  @xcite ; iii ) the addition of extra matter multiplets at intermediate energies or close to the gut scale  @xcite . in particular",
    "only i ) requires an intermediate stage of field - theoretical grand unification , which , therefore , may or may not be necessary . for model building",
    "it is important to have a view on the relative plausibility of these two alternatives .",
    "of help , to this purpose , it would be to know better which are the consequences , at the large scale , of the non - gut picture , as derived from string theory .",
    "can we distinguish the two alternatives in a phenomenological way other than discussing the unification of couplings itself ?",
    "hereafter , when important , by unification i will mean grand unification .",
    "it is both logical and useful , at this stage , to briefly recall the ways to find an experimental signal of supersymmetry and unification .",
    "they are summarized in table 1 , togheter with a qualification of their significance .",
    "all boxes of this table require , as always , an element of judgement .",
    "let me briefly comment on each of them , not before having noticed that an entry on neutrino masses might have been added to the list .",
    "neutrino masses are indeed generally expected in a unified theory .",
    "the reason for not having such an entry in table 1 is twofold : neutrino masses are not a specific prediction of unified theories only , nor there is a value for neutrino masses that unified theories clearly prefer , at least in my view .",
    "having said that , i will have to defend the insertion of `` non standard fcnc '' in table 1 .",
    "the last part of the talk is devoted to this issue .",
    "._summary of possible signals for supersymmetry and unification . _ [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     some of these new interactions are still controlled by the same cabibbo kobayashi maskawa matrix , @xmath12 , which appears in the standard charged current weak interactions .",
    "the related new effects are there no matter how supersymmetry is broken and are therefore present in any realistic supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "observables that could be affected in a significant way by these new sources of flavour violations , depending on the spectrum of the superpartners , are the inclusive @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite rates . the current experimental average branching ratio for @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath16  @xcite , compared with the pure sm prediction , @xmath17  @xcite , still leaves room for a sizeable new contribution , negatively interfering with the sm amplitude .    in general , however , other sources of fcnc / cp - violations are present , not controlled by the ckm matrix .",
    "a necessary condition for their physical relevance is the non degeneracy , in flavour space , of the supersymmetry breaking masses of the scalar partners of fermions with given charge and chirality .",
    "if supersymmetry and flavour breaking are decoupled , as in `` gauge - mediation - type '' models , no such extra source of fcnc / cp - violation needs to be present . in the opposite case , like in `` supergravity - type '' models , they are present  @xcite and expected to be sizeable if grand unification is realized  @xcite .",
    "in general these effects are described by new unitary mixing matrices occurring in the gaugino vertices , called @xmath18 hereafter , and by some other fcnc / cp - violating parameters in the analytic scalar potential .",
    "generically , these models are actually in serious danger of conflicting with existing observations , or non observations , due to supersymmetric fcnc / cp - violating loop effects  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , several ideas have been recently put forward to avoid this problem , referred to as the `` supersymmetric flavour problem '' . an attempt to summarize them",
    "is made in table 2 , also including the `` universality '' option . given the variety of possibilities , there is a significant amount of arbitrariness in preparing this table . to balance this arbitrariness",
    ", it will be useful to consider the original references and also the discussion given by nir  @xcite at this conference on related matters .",
    "i have already commented upon the `` universality '' case  @xcite , which can certainly be realized in `` gauge - mediation - type '' models  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to get close enough to it even in supergravity , with universal boundary conditions , if no unification is realized , since the flavour - breaking renormalization effects due to the top yukawa couplings , @xmath19 ,  @xcite are small enough and , most importantly , they do not introduce new cp - violating phases nor they affect leptons . maybe a dynamical way of realizing `` universality '' in supergravity exists , using strong renormalization effects which could lead the supersymmetry breaking masses to flavour - universal fixed points  @xcite .",
    "however , i have not yet seen nor have been able to find myself a fully realistic realization of this idea .",
    "the ideas that try to solve the `` supersymmetric flavour problem '' without resorting to flavour - degenerate scalar masses can perhaps be grouped into three distinct categories : i ) alignment ; ii ) heavy @xmath20 ; iii ) non abelian flavour symmetries .    in its simplest version , alignment  @xcite",
    "is the notion that some abelian flavour symmetry may force the yukawa coupling matrix responsible for the down - type quark to be ( approximately ) diagonal with the down s - quark mass matrices in the same superfield basis .",
    "this is as saying that the neutral gaugino interactions of the down quark - squarks will not involve any non trivial @xmath18-mixing matrix , thus keeping under control an otherwise very problematic effect in @xmath21 transitions , especially related to the @xmath22 parameter in kaon physics  @xcite .",
    "one should not forget here that another very stringent constraint on fcnc / cp effects comes from the non observation , so far , of any lepton flavour violating process like @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "to satisfy this new constraint requires an alignment in the lepton sector too .",
    "although this is possible , i do not know how to make all this consistent with unification .",
    "the most likely signatures of alignment are in any case related to the mixing matrices @xmath18 in the up quark - squark sector , i.e. occurring in the neutron electric dipole moment , via the u - quark edm , and in mixing or cp - violation in the charm system .    the fact that the most dangerous fcnc / cp effects come from exchanges of non degenerate scalars of the first and second generations",
    "can be put togheter  @xcite , in an attempt to alleviate the problem , with the observation , mentioned in sect.1 , that these same scalars can be considerably heavier than those ones of the third generation , between 1 and 10 tev , without conflicting with the naturalness constraint  @xcite .",
    "this possibility is called `` heavy @xmath20 '' in table 2 .",
    "although this is enough to suppress the lfv processes , this is not the case for the @xmath22 parameter , which requires a further suppression by about two orders of magnitude , maybe coming from the smallness of the relevant phase(s ) .    finally , is it not possible that the same flavour symmetry that keeps the ckm matrix and the @xmath18-matrices close to @xmath24 , also forces the first and second generation scalars to be degenerate enough to solve the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 problems automatically ? among many different alternatives  @xcite ,",
    "a clear candidate emerges for such a symmetry , which is consistent with unification : a @xmath25 symmetry acting on the three generations of matter fields @xmath26 , as a doublet plus a singlet , @xmath27 and trivially on the higgs fields  @xcite . whereas u(3 ) is the largest flavour symmetry group in presence of full vertical unification and for vanishing yukawa couplings , u(2 ) is the leftover subgroup after taking into account the large @xmath19 .",
    "the key observation is that , in the limit of unbroken u(2 ) , the first two generations of fermions are massless , @xmath28 , the first two generations of sfermions are degenerate , @xmath29 and the ckm - matrix is @xmath30 , as are the @xmath18-matrices .",
    "therefore , a simple pattern of small u(2)-breaking can correlate the small fermion masses @xmath31 and @xmath32 to slightly non degenerate sfermions of the first two generations , @xmath33 , and to small deviations from unity of both @xmath12 and the @xmath18-matrices  @xcite .",
    "the interesting outcome of all this , other than the correlation between fermion masses and the ckm parameters , is that the significant fcnc / cp effects from supersymmetric loops come from the third generation of sfermions not being degenerate with the first two and with @xmath18-mixing angles similar to the corresponding ckm angles . in turn",
    ", this gives effects of naturally similar magnitude as the sm effects both in @xmath22 and in @xmath34 mixing , which all come from top exchanges .",
    "this is consistent with present observations .",
    "it should no longer be , however , after the experiments foreseen in b - physics in the next few years  @xcite .",
    "the u(2 ) symmetry does not give any control on the splitting among the third and the first or second generations of scalars .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , already the renormalization effects due to the large @xmath19 in a unified theory induce splittings of relative order unity both in the s - quark and in the s - lepton case  @xcite .",
    "the splitting among s - leptons is also particularly interesting : it is a fact that third generation s - leptons significantly non degenerate with the first two generations and with @xmath18-mixing angles similar to the corresponding ckm angles give lvf effects , in @xmath23 or in @xmath35 convertion in atoms , close to the current limits for sparticle masses in their full natural range , as defined above .",
    "the same remark applies to the electron edm  @xcite , if the new phase in the relevant @xmath18-matrix is of order unity .",
    "the theoretical case for unified theories is strong and supported by a piece of empirical evidence , the successful prediction of the strong coupling constant .",
    "means exist to establish or strongly indicate supersymmetric unification experimentally , some of which compelling : the searches for supersymmetric particles and for a light higgs , both within reach of facilities now active or under construction . motivated by supersymmetry and unification",
    "are also the searches for proton decay and for dark matter in the form of wimps .",
    "finally , several observables in flavour physics are likely to be affected in a significant way by virtual exchanges of supersymmetric particles .",
    "this will have to be the case , i believe , if unification is realized in the supergravity way , with flavour breaking coupled to supersymmetry breaking . in some cases , like the @xmath22 parameter and mixing or cp violation in the b - system ,",
    "the supersymmetric effects compete with the sm effects , from which they have to be disentangled . in other cases , like in @xmath23 and in the electron and neutron edms",
    ", these effects stand as unambiguous signals of new physics .",
    "their finding , togheter with the study of the ckm parameters , might also shed light on the role , so far elusive , of flavour symmetries .",
    "i consider the experimental effort in these directions very worthful .",
