    "the discovery of the berry phase @xcite revolutionized the study of many quantum mechanical phenomena . to explain this discovery , consider a quantum system with a hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents a vector of _ control parameters _ that can change with time along a prescribed path .",
    "the state of the quantum system is described by a complex valued wave function @xmath2 .",
    "however , the physical state itself only determines its wave function up to a phase because the wave functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 define the same physical state .",
    "we assume that , initially , the wave function is in one of the nondegenerate eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath0 .    if the control parameters @xmath4 change with time adiabatically slowly , then the hamiltonian is explicitly time dependent but the _ adiabatic theorem _ of quantum mechanics @xcite guarantees that the wave function will remain an instantaneous eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath5 during the evolution .",
    "assume also that control parameters are changing along a closed countour in the parameter space , so that at the end of the evolution they return to the initial values , as in fig .",
    "[ contour ] . according to the adiabatic theorem , after completing the cycle ,",
    "the physical state of the system should coincide with the initial one .",
    "this theorem , does not mean that the phase of the wave function returns to the initial value .",
    "careful examination shows @xcite that the phase picked up after a cyclic evolution can be written as a sum of two components @xmath6 where the dynamic phase @xmath7 appears even when parameters are fixed , @xmath8 is time of cyclic evolution , @xmath9 is energy detemined as the instantaneous eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath5 , and we assume that @xmath10 . the second contribution in ( [ gaugepsi2 ] )",
    "is called the _",
    "berry phase_. it has no stationary counterpart and is purely geometrical , in the sense that it depends only on the choice of the hamiltonian and on the path in the parameter space . in particular",
    ", it does not depend explicitly on time of the evolution @xmath8 or on the rate of motion along the contour .",
    "given the dependence of the eigenstate @xmath11 of the hamiltonian on @xmath4 in some gauge , the berry phase is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the contour in the space of control parameters , and @xmath14 is called _ the berry connection _ ( see david j. griffiths @xcite for a pedagogical derivation ) .     a closed contour in a control parameter space.,width=115 ]    the cyclic berry phase is gauge invariant and has measurable effects , which have been confirmed experimentally .",
    "berry s discovery has a rich prehistory .",
    "as berry himself pointed out @xcite , a number of effects in quantum mechanics had been related to the unusual phase evolution of the wave function even before the berry s discovery @xcite .",
    "other historical antecedents can be found , for example , in the first efforts to create a semiclassical theory of the anomalous hall effect @xcite .",
    "however , it was berry s work that unified all these known geometric effects under a universal theoretical framework .",
    "this framework has proved very useful in uncovering new effects and has provided the theoretical groundwork for entire branches of physics such as topological quantum computations @xcite , the quantum theory of polarization @xcite and the theories behind various extraordinary hall effects @xcite .",
    "the berry phase is an example of the _ anholonomy _ effect encountered in the theory of differential equations .",
    "anholonomy can be non - rigorously defined as failure of vectors return to their initial values after a parallel transport along a closed contour .",
    "since there are both quantum mechanical and classical mechanical antecedents of the geometric phase , it is natural to ask whether there are also antecedents in stochastic processes . here , we should point out that there is a fundamental difference from quantum mechanics , which prevents direct analogies .",
    "while the state of a quantum system defines the wave function only up to an overall phase , a classical ergodic stochastic system can be described by a probability vector , without allowing any additional freedom in its definition .",
    "for example , consider a _",
    "markov process _",
    ", i.e a stochastic process whose future evolution depends only on the present state but does not depend on the past .",
    "the evolution of the probability vector satisfies equations which are reminiscent of the quantum mechanical evolution . fig .",
    "[ two - state ] shows the simple example of a 2-state quantum system and its stochastic counterpart . in both cases the evolution",
    "is described by linear differential equations with @xmath15 evolution matrices . in the quantum mechanical case ,",
    "the amplitudes @xmath16 and @xmath17 of two states evolve according to the schrdinger equation @xmath18 while the continuous 2-state markov process , with probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the first and the second states , is defined by differential system @xcite @xmath21 where parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are called _",
    "kinetic rates_. they describe how often a system jumps from one state into the other .",
    "two - state systems : ( a ) quantum ( b ) stochastic.,width=230 ]    in spite of the similarity of eqs .",
    "( [ shrod ] ) and ( [ shrod - stoch ] ) , it is well known that a quantum mechanical , cyclically driven 2-state system can have a nontrivial geometric berry phase , but that is not true for its stochastic counterpart . for given values of parameters ,",
    "an ergodic markov chain has a unique steady state . under slow evolution of parameters",
    ", the probability vector will simply follow the path of instantaneous steady state values , returning to the initial vector after the parameters complete a full cycle .",
    "this example shows that , in an obvious sense , the markov process does not lead to adiabatic geometric phases .",
    "however , this conclusion is restricted only to the evolution of the probability vector for a present state .",
    "there are other characteristics describing stochastic processes .",
    "for example , one can consider stochastic transitions among 3 states in fig .",
    "[ three - state ] and ask what is the probability that the system makes exactly @xmath24 full cycles in a clockwise direction by the given time @xmath25 . in the following sections",
    ", we will derive the evolution equations for similar quantities and show that geometric phases do play an important role in their evolution .     a 3-state markov chain .",
    "this model can be considered as a minimal model to describe the stochastic behavior of a molecular motor in fig .",
    "[ f0f1].,width=172 ]    anholonomies also play a central role in classical thermodynamics .",
    "the carnot cycle is an example of a thermodynamic process exhibiting anholonomy @xcite .",
    "statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium can be specified by a set of parameters , such as the volume , the pressure and the temperature .",
    "slow cyclic changes of these parameters merely produce cyclic changes of the equilibrium properties , so , as in the example of a 2-state markov chain , a driven system returns to the initial state in a statistical sense by the end of a cycle .",
    "however , if one looks at the same process from a more general point of view , namely including effects of this process not only on the given system , but also on systems in contact with it , a cyclic adiabatic evolution of control parameters usually does not lead to the same finite state in the full phase space . the laws of thermodynamics predict that the system converts part of the absorbed energy into production of the work .",
    "moreover , for adiabatically slow evolution , the work produced depends only on the choice of the contour in the parameter space , but depends neither on the rate of motion nor on the mechanism of coupling to the environment .",
    "this means that the work can be expressed as a contour integral over the path in the space of control parameters .",
    "for example , for a gas in a reservoir with variable volume @xmath26 and temperature @xmath8 , the work @xmath27 produced per cycle is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pressure",
    ".    the property of dynamic systems to change their state in response to a periodic perturbation with zero bias has been widely used in control theory @xcite . look e.g. at the simple input / output model described by differential equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 are smooth functions of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 represent control parameters .",
    "one can consider a simple periodic evolution in the control parameter space by setting @xmath34 during an infinitesimal time interval @xmath25 , where @xmath35 is @xmath36 when @xmath37 and @xmath38 otherwise .",
    "after this , one sets @xmath39 during the following time interval @xmath40 , then takes @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and finishes with @xmath43 during @xmath44 .",
    "trajectory of @xmath45 in response to a periodic infinitesimal path in the space of control parameters @xmath46 . ]",
    "an easy perturbative calculation shows that , after one such an infinitesimal evolution in the space of control parameters with zero bias , the vector @xmath32 does not generally return to the initial state but rather acquires an additional correction , namely @xmath47 ( { \\bf x}_0 ) + { \\rm o}(t^3 ) ,    \\label{corr1}\\ ] ] where the operation @xmath48^{i}=(f_1^{j } \\partial f_2^{i}/\\partial x^{j})- ( f_2^j \\partial f_1^i /\\partial x^j)$ ] is called the _ lie brackets _ of the vector fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in general , the the value at @xmath51 of the lie bracket @xmath48 $ ] can even be linearly independent of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this phenomenon is exploited in chow s theorem which , together with the theorem of frobenius , describes the space of configurations that can be reached using only a prescribed set of vector fields to get around @xcite .",
    "although the history of anholonomy effects reaches at least as far back as the 19th century , a complete survey of its development is beyond the scope of this article and we will not pursue it further . instead , we will concentrate on applications of geometric phases to stochastic and dissipative processes .",
    "these topics have attracted attention relatively recently due , in part , to the success of the berry phase in quantum mechanics .",
    "we attempted to make the review accessible to an audience not familiar with the mathematical theory of fiber bundles .",
    "this review is also not about the large body of work related to decoherence effects on quantum mechanical berry phases or on geometric phases in chaotic non - dissipative systems .",
    "the reader should consult @xcite for an introduction to these topics .",
    "the structure of this review is as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews extensions of the berry phase idea to non - unitary evolution .",
    "section 3 describes the theory and applications of geometric phases in dissipative systems with a continuous symmetry of steady state solutions .",
    "one important application is to control of pattern motion in nonlinear media .",
    "section 4 briefly reviews the geometric theory of locomotion of micro - organisms . in section 5",
    ", we introduce the stochastic pump effect and its relation to geometric phases in the evolution of the moment generating functions . in section 6",
    ", we generalize the concept of the geometric phase in stochastic processes to noncyclic evolutions . in section 7 ,",
    "we explain how geometric phases can influence the kinetics of slow variables in a coarse - grained description of a stochastic process with a hierarchy of important time scales .",
    "this is regarded as a stochastic analog of the quantum mechanical born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "we also study stochastic analogs of berry phases from this point of view .",
    "the reader who is not interested in complicated mathematical details might prefer to skip section 7 on a first reading . in section 8 ,",
    "we review the geometric phases in the `` limit cycle '' evolution .",
    "section 9 is about constraints that detailed balance conditions impose on geometric effects in systems near thermodynamic equilibrium . in section 10",
    ", we apply some of the techniques we have discussed to the theory of molecular motor operations . in section 11 , we outline several directions for possible future research .",
    "non - unitary evolution is often considered in quantum mechanical problems , where the coupling to the environment is described phenomenologically by introducing extra parameters in the equations of motion for a density matrix or a wave function . in many physical problems one can encounter evolution equations , similar to quantum mechanical ones but with a non - hermitian operator replacing the hamiltonian .",
    "examples can be found in electronic circuits @xcite , optics @xcite , acoustics @xcite .",
    "the evolution of any dissipative system near a stable point or a limit cycle can be linearized and assume a form similar to the quantum mechanical schrdinger equation for a state vector . motivated by the success of the quantum mechanical berry phase , several studies @xcite were devoted to geometric phases in systems with non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "the models considered could generally be written in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is arbitrary @xmath56 matrix , and @xmath57 is an @xmath58-vector .    imitating the derivation of",
    "the quantum mechanical berry phase in the adiabatic limit leads one to a similar result : if the vector @xmath11 at the initial moment of the evolution is one of the eigenstates of the matrix @xmath59 , i.e. if @xmath60 then after a slow cyclic evolution of parameters , the vector @xmath11 generally returns to the initial one up to a factor @xmath61 which can be separated into dynamic and geometric parts . strictly speaking ,",
    "the values in the exponents in ( [ nonherm3 ] ) are not phases because they are no longer purely imaginary .",
    "however , it is generally accepted to use the term , `` phase '' , because of the strong analogy with quantum mechanical phases .",
    "berry @xcite pointed that it is convenient to express the geometric phase by introducing also the left - eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath59 , such that @xmath62 the eigenvalues for left and right eigenvectors coincide . for a non - hermitian hamiltonian ,",
    "the eigenvalues are no longer real and the components of the left eigenvector are no longer complex conjugates of the right eigenvector . in other respects , there is a strong similarity with quantum mechanical berry phases , e.g. the connection @xmath14 can be written as @xmath63    non - unitary evolution does not necessarily describes a dissipation . the geometric phases with a non - hermitian hamiltonian that realizes transformations of the group @xmath64 ( i.e. transformations that preserve the form @xmath65 of a complex valued 2-vector @xmath66 ) , have attracted considerable attention because of their applications to squeezed states @xcite , and a number of models in classical mechanics and optics @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath64 is a covering group of the 3-d lorentz group .",
    "the corresponding geometric phase is responsible for a variety of relativistic effects , such as thomas precession @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the review @xcite . more important for our subject",
    "is that the group @xmath64 is isomorphic to the group @xmath67 of @xmath15 matrices with real entries and the unit determinant .",
    "the @xmath67 evolution can be used to describe a classical dissipative system .",
    "corresponding geometric phases were studied both theoretically and experimentally in connection with light propagation through a set of polarizers @xcite .",
    "recently , the relation of this geometric phase to the stochastic pump effect was discussed in @xcite .    the geometric phase in eq .",
    "( [ nonherm3 ] ) was generalized to nonabelian and non - adiabatic evolutions @xcite and a number of applications were proposed , e.g. to optically active refracting media @xcite . one interesting property of non - hermitian hamiltonians , not found in quantum mechanics , is the possibility of so - called exceptional points in the spectrum . if a contour encloses such points , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are not single valued along this contour .",
    "a simple example is the following @xmath68 matrix , which depends on a complex parameter @xmath69 and which has @xmath38 as an exceptional point : @xmath70 its eigenvalues @xmath71 are double valued functions on the space @xmath72 .",
    "encircling such points , the eigenvectors acquire a geometric phase of a new type which has been studied theoretically in @xcite and observed in experiments @xcite .    in spite of this progress",
    ", one might think that the geometric phase in dissipative evolution would be insignificant in comparison with the dynamic part in ( [ nonherm3 ] ) on the grounds that the latter becomes either exponentially large or exponentially small with time .",
    "however , not all modes in dissipative evolution grow or decay exponentially since the matrix @xmath55 might also have zero modes , i.e. one or several linearly independent states with a zero eigenvalue . if all other modes decay quickly , according to ( [ nonherm3 ] ) , the evolution of such a dissipative system in the adiabatic limit should instead be governed by the geometric phases .",
    "more generally , geometric phases can also be important when , for fixed values of parameters , a system relaxes to a limit cycle . in that case",
    ", the corresponding eigenvalue is purely imaginary .",
    "in early 1990s , landsberg @xcite , and independently ning and haken @xcite , suggested that geometric phases should generally appear in many classical systems which can be described by a set of nonlinear differential equations with a one - parameter group of symmetry transformations .",
    "in such a system , it is possible to reduce the evolution equations to a form in which one of the variables does not affect the evolution of the others , that is @xmath73 where @xmath74 and the vector @xmath75 represent generalized coordinates of the system while @xmath76 and @xmath77 are nonlinear functions of the coordinate vector @xmath75 , but not of @xmath78 .",
    "assume that the system is initially at the steady state and that the parameter vector @xmath79 changes slowly with time .",
    "landsberg considered the case when the evolution of the variable @xmath75 is dissipative , so that if parameters @xmath79 are time - independent , @xmath75 relaxes to a steady state value @xmath80 . in that case , for adiabatically slow evolution of @xmath79 , @xmath75 simply follows a quasi - steady state trajectory up to a small non - adiabatic correction @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the linearization of the vector function @xmath76 , and @xmath83 is the inverse of the linear function @xmath84 .",
    "however , one should not assume that @xmath78 can be uniquely determined by given values of the control parameters .",
    "due to the symmetry @xmath85 of eq .",
    "( [ eq_lan1 ] ) , where @xmath86 is arbitrary constant , the steady state value of @xmath78 is not specified .",
    "hence @xmath78 does not have to return to its initial value after the parameters @xmath79 complete a full cycle .",
    "landsberg showed in @xcite that , after a cyclic evolution , the variable @xmath78 changes by an amount given by a trivial dynamic part @xmath87 plus a geometric contribution @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the linearization of the function @xmath77 near the point @xmath90 .",
    "suppose , that instead of a vector @xmath75 with discrete set of entries , we deal with continuous systems .",
    "the vector index then becomes a continuous coordinate and @xmath75 is a function of this coordinate .",
    "to generalize ( [ eq_lan2 ] ) to such continuous systems , landsberg considered equations of the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is now a nonlinear operator , which depends on time only through time - dependent control parameters @xmath79 , and where the evolution equation ( [ eq_lan3 ] ) is assumed to be invariant under a continuous group @xmath93 of symmetries , such as the group of translations in the direction of the coordinate @xmath94 .",

    "a number of theoretical and experimental studies of the motion of domain walls in liquid crystals under the influence of periodic perturbations have been performed @xcite , but the role of the geometric phase has not been discussed .",
    "landsberg s theory was aimed at control of wave patterns in nonlinear media .",
    "such control was discussed in more detail for specific applications to nonlinear chemical reactions @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , hydrodynamics @xcite and semiconductor microresonators @xcite . optical applications proposed by ning and haken were extended by toronov and derbov @xcite .",
    "studies of special problems with a mathematical structure similar to the landsberg - ning - haken formalism can be found even prior to refs .",
    "for example , the use of a rotating electric field was suggested as a means of separating chiral molecules in solution @xcite .",
    "recently this idea was extended to the gaseous state , but the proposed effect is expected to be observed in the non - adiabatic regime @xcite .",
    "geometric phases can also contribute to the anomalous shift of the trajectory of a magnetic bubble in a rotating nonuniform magnetic field , which is called the _ skew - deflection effect _ @xcite .",
    "control over the motion of domain walls and other topological defects has been extensively studied in magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "the example of the domain wall shown above demonstrates that the projection of dynamics on the collective degrees of freedom should be performed with extra care to account for possible geometric phase effects .",
    "for example , in the micromagnetics literature , one often finds that the equations of motion for the collective coordinates @xmath124 read @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the generalized force , @xmath127 is the symmetric dissipation matrix and @xmath93 is the antisymmetric gyrotropic matrix .",
    "however , eq . ( [ micromagn ] ) can lead to problems . in the case of a domain wall ( [ dw2 ]",
    ") , one can attempt to work with a single collective coordinate representing the position of the domain wall , and to regard the angle @xmath107 and the size of the domain wall @xmath117 as fast variables .",
    "this choice might seem natural in view of the fact that translation is the only continuous symmetry in the model and should dominate the physics at low energies and under slow perturbations .",
    "however , in the model under consideration , the wall was moving because some parameters became time - dependent . in the static case , there are no forces on the chosen collective degrees of freedom .",
    "( [ micromagn ] ) can acquire extra geometric terms in explicitly time dependent situations , and is therefore not , in itself , sufficiently general even when only slow changes of parameters are considered . as another word of caution",
    ", we note that the translational symmetries in real applications are only approximate for standard magnetic materials because of the presence of impurities and discreteness of the lattice . as discussed in @xcite , this is a serious obstacle to purely geometric control over magnetic defects in practical applications .",
    "one of the first applications of geometric phases in dissipative systems was proposed by shapere and wilczek @xcite in their description of locomotion of microscopic organisms in a viscous fluid .",
    "this theory was based on the well known observation that the motion of living organisms at low reynolds numbers is , in fact , geometrical .",
    "microscopic living organisms propel themselves in a liquid by performing periodic changes of their shapes .",
    "these changes correspond to noncyclic motion in a larger space , whose points describe the shape of the body , its position and its overall orientation .",
    "one can choose a _ gauge _ in this phase space , i.e. a rule to determine the position and the orientation of the body of any given shape with respect to a fixed coordinate system in the 3-dimensional space .",
    "using such a gauge one can characterize the state of the body by a set of coordinates @xmath128 , where @xmath110 is a vector of shape parameters and @xmath129 consists of the position @xmath130 and orientation @xmath131 of the body .",
    "body shapes are assumed to be directly controllable by the organism subject to certain constraints such as conservation of volume , which allow only finite and quasi - periodic changes of @xmath132 .",
    "the body interacts with a high viscosity liquid which is described by the incompressible navier - stokes equation .",
    "this equation should be solved with no - slip boundary conditions at the surface of the organism to guarantee the absence of force and a torque on it . for slow changes of shape , these no - slip conditions are expressible in terms of the first partial derivatives of @xmath94 with respect to time . in particular , they are automatically satisfied by non - moving bodies . after eliminating the degrees of freedom of the liquid by solving the navier - stokes equation ,",
    "the equation that connects changes of @xmath94 and @xmath132 follows from the boundary conditions and has the form @xmath133 where the connection @xmath14 is defined on the space of body shapes .",
