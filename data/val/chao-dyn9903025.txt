    "exponential distribution of escape times from chaotic scattering systems should be expected only if the associated repeller is hyperbolic . for intermittent repellers",
    "one expects asymptotic power law decay@xcite . nevertheless , in numerical simulations one often observes what appears to be a perfect exponential@xcite , and an expected crossover to a power law may be hard to detect , because it may occur after a long time where it is difficult to obtain descent statistics .",
    "the importance of intermittency can not be overemphasized .",
    "a generic hamiltonian system exhibits a mixed phase space structure .",
    "a typical trajectory is intermittently trapped close to the stable islands @xcite .",
    "but even fully chaotic billiards may exhibit intermittency , typically if they have neutrally stable orbits .",
    "popular billiards such as the stadium and the sinai billiards are of this type .",
    "a quantum dot is an open scattering system in two dimensions , obtained by connecting leads to a cavity .",
    "inspired by quantum chaos research , one likes to contrast shapes of the cavity corresponding to chaotic motion , like the stadium , with shapes corresponding to integrable motion , like the rectangle or the square .",
    "both extreme cases are sensitive to naturally occurring imperfections and one naturally ends up with mixed phase space systems where one component hopefully dominates .",
    "consequently , the signals of underlying chaos or integrability do nt show up as clear cut as one would have hoped for .",
    "much of the analysis of these problems has been numerical and heuristic . to strengthen the theoretical analysis",
    "we will , in this paper , apply periodic orbit theory and cycle expansions to make quantitative predictions concerning the asymptotic distribution of escape times from an intermittent map .",
    "we will demonstrate that a _ pre - asymptotic _ exponential escape law is associated with a pair of complex conjugate zeroes of the zeta function beyond its domain of convergence .",
    "this zero will be computed with a simple resummation technique@xcite .",
    "the truly asymptotic escape distribution will be a power law , and is associated with a branch point of the zeta function .",
    "the strength of this power law will also be provided by the resummation scheme , whereas the particular power is known from analytic argument for our particular model system .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the pre - exponential and the power law will yield a good estimate of the cross over time , which will be surprisingly high .",
    "much of the early work on cycle expansion @xcite was concerned with escape from ( hyperbolic ) repellers , so we can follow ref .",
    "@xcite rather closely when deriving the basic formulas relating escape to the periodic orbits of the repeller .",
    "consider a 1-d map , on some interval @xmath0 , with @xmath1 monotone branches @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "each branch @xmath2 is defined on an interval @xmath4 . a generating partition is then given by @xmath5 .",
    "we want the map to admit an unrestricted symbolic dynamics .",
    "we therefore require all branches to map their domain @xmath6 onto some interval @xmath7 covering @xmath8 .",
    "a trajectory is considered to escape when some iterate of the map @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10th level partition @xmath11 can be constructed iteratively . here",
    "@xmath12 are words of length n built from the alphabet @xmath13 .",
    "an interval is thus defined recursively according to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the concatenation of letter @xmath16 with word @xmath12 .",
    "a concrete example will be given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : themap ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : themap ] .",
    "next define the characteristic function for the @xmath10th level partition @xmath17 where @xmath18 an initial point surviving @xmath10 iterations must be contained in @xmath19 .",
    "starting from an initial ( normalized ) distribution @xmath20 we can express the fraction that survives @xmath10 iterations as @xmath21 we choose the distribution @xmath20 to be uniform on the interval @xmath0 .",
    "the survival probability is then given by @xmath22 where @xmath23    assuming hyperbolicity the size of @xmath24 can be related to the stability @xmath25 of periodic orbit @xmath26 according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 , can be bounded close to the size of @xmath0 .",
    "this results from the fact that @xmath29 , the smallness of @xmath30 and the fact that derivatives can be bounded due to hyperbolicity",
    ". we will eventually relax the assumption of hyperbolicity , but for the moment we ll stick to it .",
    "the survival fraction can now be bounded by the periodic orbit sum according to @xmath31 for all @xmath32 . for large @xmath33 ( and assuming hyperbolicity ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be chosen close to unity .    the periodic orbit sum in ( [ eqn : boundhyper ] )",
    "will be denoted @xmath36 @xmath37 and can be rewritten as a sum over primitive periodic orbits ( period @xmath38 ) and their repetitions @xmath39    it is closely related to the trace of the perron - frobenius operator @xmath40    by introducing the zeta function @xmath41 the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 can be expressed as a contour integral @xmath42 where the small contour @xmath43 encircles the origin in negative direction .",
    "the expansion of the zeta function to a power series is usually referred to as a _ cycle expansion_. @xmath44 this representation converges up to the leading singularity , unlike the product representation ( [ eqn : zzdef ] ) which diverges at ( nontrivial ) zeroes .",
    "if the zeta function @xmath45 is analytic in a disk extending beyond the leading zero @xmath46 , then the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 , and hence the survival probability @xmath47 , will decay asymptotically as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the escape rate .",
    "we will introduce intermittency in connection with a specific model .",
    "we then consider an intermittent map @xmath50 with two branches @xmath51 , and where @xmath0 is chosen as the unit interval : @xmath52 the map is intermittent if @xmath53 and allows escape if @xmath54 .",
    "the map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : themap ] , together with some of its partitions .",
    "the right edge of the left branch @xmath55 , denoted @xmath56 , is implicitly defined by @xmath57 .",
    "the particle is considered to escape if @xmath58 .",
    "the intermittent property is related to the fact that the cycle @xmath59 is neutrally stable @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , cycle stabilities can no longer be exponentially bounded with length .",
    "this loss of hyperbolicity makes it difficult to relate the survival probability @xmath47 to the periodic orbit sums @xmath36 . indeed , eq . ( [ eqn : absiq ] )",
    "is brutally violated in some cases , as can been realized from the following example .",
    "the problem of intermittency is best represented by the family of periodic orbits @xmath61 .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : recrule ] ) and ( [ eqn : themap ] ) that @xmath62 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 which should be compared with the asymptotic behavior of the stabilities @xmath65    the difference in power laws seems to spoil every possibility of a bound like ( [ eqn : boundhyper ] ) . however , eq . ( [ eqn : absiq ] ) is not necessary for that purpose .",
    "it suffices if the ratio @xmath66 stays bounded . that it to say that it suffices if the average size of the intervals along a cycle can be related to the stability , rather than each interval separately . here",
    "@xmath67 denotes the shift operator .",
    "we check this numerically on two sequences : @xmath61 and @xmath68 , the former being most sensitive to intermittency .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] .",
    "we note that for both sequences , @xmath69 appear to tend to well defined limits , where @xmath61 lead to the largest deviation from unity .",
    "indeed , it is reasonable to assume that the sequence @xmath61 provides a lower bound @xmath70 in view of this , the numerical results strongly suggest that @xmath69 stays bounded , and that , for this particular system , @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : boundhyper ] ) can be chosen as @xmath72 and @xmath73 presumably close to unity .",
    "this is a surprisingly low price to pay for the complication of intermittency .",
    "the sizes of the intervals @xmath74 has no relation whatsoever to the stability of the cycle @xmath59 , which is unity . we exclude the intervals @xmath74 from our considerations by _ pruning _ the fixpoint from the zeta function @xmath75 the contribution from @xmath74 to @xmath47 can be added separately if required .",
    "since the result rely on summation along periodic orbits , it might break down for some choices of the initial distribution @xmath20 were such a summation is not carried out .",
    "after having argued that the survival probability @xmath47 still can be bounded close to periodic orbit sums @xmath76 we turn to the problem of computing the asymptotics of these periodic orbit sums .",
    "the coefficients of the cycle expansion ( [ eqn : cycexp ] ) for the map ( [ eqn : themap ] ) decay asymptotically as @xmath77 which induces a singularity of the type @xmath78 in the zeta function @xcite .",
    "if @xmath79 is an integer , the singularity is @xmath80 .    to evaluate the periodic orbit sum it is convenient to consider a resummation of the zeta function around the branch point @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82    in practical calculations one has only a finite number of coefficients @xmath83 , @xmath84 of the cycle expansion at disposal . here",
    "@xmath85 is the cutoff in ( topological ) length . in @xcite",
    "we proposed a simple resummation scheme for the computation of the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 in ( [ eqn : genseri ] ) .",
    "we replace the infinite in ( [ eqn : genseri ] ) sums by finite sums of increasing degrees , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and require that @xmath90 one expands @xmath91 in binomial sums ( series ) .",
    "if @xmath92 this leads to a solvable linear system of equations yielding the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is natural to require that @xmath93 so that the maximal powers of the two sums in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : genserf ] ) are adjacent .",
    "if the zeta function is entire in the entire @xmath94 plane ( except for the branch cut ) the periodic orbit sum can be written @xmath95 the sum is over all zeroes @xmath96 of the zeta function ( assuming they are not degenerated ) and the contour @xmath97 goes round the branch cut in positive direction",
    ". if poles and/or natural boundaries are present , expression ( [ eqn : periodic orbit sumsplit ] ) must be accordingly modified .",
    "the leading asymptotic behavior is provided by the vicinity of the branch point @xmath81 , and is found to be @xcite @xmath98    the relevant ratio @xmath99 , obtained from the resummation scheme , versus cutoff length @xmath85 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratconv ] . in all numerical work",
    "we have used the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 . and computed all periodic orbits up to length 20 .",
    "there is also a pair of complex conjugate zeroes , @xmath102 close to the branch cut .",
    "they contribute both to the sum over zeroes and to the integral around the cut in ( [ eqn : periodic orbit sumsplit ] ) .",
    "but since their imaginary part @xmath103 is small , they will , in effect , contribute a factor @xmath104 to the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 .",
    "this zero will dominate @xmath36 in some range @xmath105 before the asymptotic power law sets in .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] we study the convergence of the real and imaginary part of @xmath46 obtained from the resummation scheme above , for different cutoffs @xmath85 .",
    "the zero is computed by newton - raphson iteration of the left hand side of ( [ eqn : genserf ] ) , after the resummation has been done .",
    "again we note that the analytic continuation technique works quite satisfactorily .",
    "the probability of escaping at iteration @xmath10 is @xmath106 we get for this distribution @xmath107 here we have neglected the interval @xmath74 , having the same asymptotic decay law as the periodic orbit sum @xmath36 . due to the uncertainty in the bounds ( [ eqn : boundhyper ] ) it can be neglected .",
    "the crossover @xmath108 takes place when the two terms in ( [ eqn : cross ] ) are of comparable magnitude . for our standard set of parameters ( @xmath101 , @xmath100 )",
    "it is found to be @xmath109 .",
    "the check our predictions we run a simulation of the system .",
    "the result can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : simulation ] ) .",
    "we note that the slope of the exponential , the power and magnitude of the power law , as well as the crossover time agrees very well with our predictions .",
    "a reader still in any doubt on the effectiveness of cycle expansions should consider the following .",
    "the simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] averaged over @xmath110 initial point , yet , in itself the result would not very conclusive . a direct evaluation of the periodic orbit sum up to say @xmath111 would require roughly @xmath112 periodic orbits .",
    "we have not bothered to perform such a cross check ! but a resummed cycle expansion provides reliable answers with a length cutoff as low as @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath114 prime cycles . admittedly , we benefitted from knowing the asymptotic power law of the cycle expansion . however , if this is not the situation , this power law is easily extracted if one uses stability ordering @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a dominating zero beyond the branch point is , in fact , very natural .",
    "consider the one - parameter family of zeta functions . @xmath115 for @xmath116 small enough",
    "there is a leading zero @xmath117 within the domain of convergence @xmath118 .",
    "this is related to the topological pressure @xcite according to @xmath119 .",
    "for instance @xmath120 is the topological entropy . for a certain @xmath116 ( actually the fractal dimension of the repeller ) the zero collides with the branch point @xmath81 , splits into two , and continue to move out beyond the branch point . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] we plot the logarithm of the leading zero ( @xmath121 ) versus @xmath116 .",
    "it is obtained from a resummation analogous to the one discussed above , cf.@xcite .",
    "it can be interpreted as the topological pressure only as long it is real .",
    "the particular form of the distribution of escape times does depend on the initial distribution @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to a uniform initial distribution .",
    "to model chaotic scattering",
    "one must imagine that particles can be injected according to any distribution .",
    "for example , one can construct a chaotic scatterer from a bounded billiard by drilling holes wherever on the boundary and injecting particles from different angles .",
    "this may even effect the asymptotic power law @xcite .",
    "periodic orbit theories can also account for other initial distributions than uniform .",
    "however , the preceding discussions about relating periodic orbit sums to survival probabilities warns us to be cautious when doing so for intermittent systems .",
    "an immediate application concerns conductance fluctuations in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath122 of the correlation function @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the transmission as function of the fermi wave number , can , after several approximations , be related to the escape distribution @xmath125 @xcite @xmath126 if there is a crossover to a power law in @xmath125 there will be an associated crossover in @xmath122 .",
    "for an intermittent chaotic systems , the crossover time may be very long - the quasi regular region component of phase space will not make itself noticed until very long times . if the elastic mean free path of electrons is much shorter than the length corresponding to the crossover time , the quasi regular component will never ve detected in this type of experiments . or the other way around , a small deviation from an integrable structure induces chaotic layers in phase space .",
    "this chaotic layers may lead to exponential escape for small times , and the experimental outcome may very well resemble predictions for fully chaotic systems .    in experiments a ( weak ) magnetic field is a more natural control parameter than the fermi energy .",
    "instead of the distribution of dwelling times one has to consider the distribution of enclosed area , a related but more subtle concept which we plan to address in future work .",
    "one has observed lorentzians shape ( predicted for chaotic systems ) of the so called weak localization peak even in near integrable structure @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to naturally occurring imperfections @xcite and rhymes well with the classical considerations above .",
    "admittedly , we have now moved far from our original intermittent map and entered the realm of speculations .",
    "what we do want to point out in this letter is that these kind of problem are well suited for periodic orbit computations - zeta functions is a powerful tool for making long time predictions , even for intermittent chaos , once the problems of analytical continuation can be overcome .",
