    "in a universe where the bulk of the mass is in the form of collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) , galaxies reside within gravitationally bound halos of cdm particles ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "the motion of these particles is effectively governed by gravity alone , so both the mass function and clustering of dark matter halos are predictable , albeit non - trivial , functions of redshift and cosmological parameters ( e.g. , press & schechter 1974 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ; jenkins et  al .",

    "gravitational collapse results in the growth of dark matter halos over cosmic time while dynamical friction leads to the orbital decay and merging of substructure within halos . as a consequence",
    ", there is the expectation that the galaxies residing within these halos will also grow via mergers .    in a cdm cosmology ,",
    "halos more massive than groups ( @xmath7 ) undergo rapid growth via merging between @xmath3 and the present day .",
    "if the stellar mass within every dark matter halo was always contained within a single central galaxy , we would expect the most massive galaxies to undergo rapid growth via mergers at @xmath8 . until relatively recently , the rapid growth of massive galaxies at @xmath8 was an almost universal prediction of cdm galaxy formation models ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ; de lucia et  al .",
    "2006 ) . however , it is difficult to predict the rate at which substructure merges within halos ( e.g. , taylor & babul 2001 ; benson et  al .",

    "; boylan - kolchin , ma , & quataert 2008 ) and at least some simulations overestimate the rate of galaxy growth via mergers .    as much of the stellar mass within groups and clusters resides within satellites ( e.g. , sandage , binggeli , & tammann 1985 ; lin & mohr 2004 ) and the diffuse intra - cluster light ( icl ; e.g. , kemp & meaburn 1991 ; gonzalez et  al .",
    "2000 ; arnaboldi et  al . 2002 ; feldmeier et  al .",
    "2004 ; zibetti et  al . 2005 ) , not all halo mergers funnel stellar mass directly into central galaxies .",
    "it is thus plausible that massive galaxies do not grow as rapidly as their host halos .",
    "the current generation of cdm galaxy formation models predict a range of assembly histories for massive galaxies , with rates of @xmath8 stellar mass growth varying by up to a factor of 2 ( e.g. , baugh et  al . 2005 ; bower et  al .",
    "2006 ; de lucia et  al .",
    "2006 ; naab et  al .",
    "when plausible models produce widely varying predictions , there is a clear need for robust observations to test these predictions .",

    "lotz et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "while there have been valiant attempts to measure the rate of galaxy growth using catalogs of merging galaxies or galaxy pairs , there are large uncertainties associated with the selection function of such objects and the time - scales for merging . at low redshift , measured rates of red galaxy stellar mass growth via mergers span from @xmath9 per @xmath10 ( e.g. , masjedi et  al .",
    "2006 ; masjedi , hogg , & blanton 2007 ) to @xmath11 per @xmath10 ( e.g. , van dokkum 2005 ) .",
    "although the exact merger rate remains a matter of debate , clearly there is some assembly of red galaxies via merging at @xmath8 .",

    ", their space density will increase with decreasing redshift .",
    "although conceptually simple , in practice such measurements are difficult .",
    "very luminous galaxies are strongly clustered ( e.g. , norberg et  al .",
    "2002 ; zehavi et  al .",
    "2005a ) , so uncertainties are dominated by the sample variance from large - scale structure rather than poisson counting statistics .",
    "the most massive galaxies typically possess strong 4000    breaks and lack strong emission lines , which complicates both optical photometry and spectroscopy of @xmath12 galaxies . despite these difficulties ,",
    "there is increasing evidence that the stellar masses of the most massive galaxies grow by 50% or less at @xmath8 ( e.g. , bundy et  al .",
    "2006 ; cimatti , daddi , & renzini 2006 ; wake et  al . 2006 ;",
    "brown et  al .",
    "2007 ; scarlata et  al . 2007 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "pure passive evolution models without any mergers remain popular ( e.g. , cimatti et  al .",
    "2006 ; wake et  al . 2006 ; scarlata et  al .",
    "2007 ) , as they provide a better _ approximation _ of massive galaxy evolution than many simulations using cdm cosmologies .",
    "however , since there is compelling evidence for galaxy mergers , the rate of stellar mass growth must be non - zero .",
    "measurements of the relationship between galaxy stellar mass and dark matter halo mass provide important clues as to how galaxies grow over cosmic time . for example , if galaxy stellar mass was directly proportional to host halo mass we would expect galaxies to grow as rapidly as their host dark matter halos during mergers . the relationship between galaxy stellar",
    "mass and halo mass has been explored , using various methods for estimating halo mass , including gravitational lensing ( e.g. , hoekstra , yee , & gladders 2004 ; mandelbaum et  al .",

    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ; e.g. , peacock & smith 2000 ; seljak 2000 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; cooray & sheth 2002 ) describes the number and distribution of galaxies within dark matter halos . as the clustering and space density of dark matter halos",
    "are predictable functions of redshift , hod models can be constrained with the observed clustering and space density of galaxies .",
    "hod models combine much of the relevant astrophysics ( e.g. , the halo mass function ) with empirical descriptions of how galaxies reside within dark matter halos .",
    "while such models can not be considered complete descriptions of galaxy evolution , they do provide key insights into how galaxies grow over cosmic time .",
    "for example , if halo mergers efficiently funnel stellar mass into central galaxies , we would expect relatively little stellar mass to reside within satellite galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we determine the hod using the measurements of the luminosity function and clustering of @xmath1 red galaxies selected from the botes field of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) and _ spitzer _ irac shallow survey .",
    "this work builds upon our previous study of the hod of the most massive ( @xmath13 ) red galaxies in botes ( white et  al .",
    "2007 , see  5.3 for a summary ) .",
    "red galaxies are an ideal population for measuring the hod and testing the predictions of galaxy formation models .",
    "as red galaxies have low star - formation rates , the growth of individual galaxies at @xmath8 should be dominated by merging ( via dynamical friction ) rather than star - formation , thus simplifying the comparison of cdm models and data . in cdm models",
    "the most massive halos undergo rapid growth via mergers at @xmath8 , and if this results in rapid growth of central galaxies , then this should be observable within our sample .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of red galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations , so the optical luminosities of @xmath8 red galaxies are tightly correlated with stellar mass . although our halo masses rely upon cdm models of the space density and clustering of halos , we can compare our halo masses with those derived with other techniques ( e.g. , x - ray temperature , weak lensing ) .",
    "in several galaxy formation models virial shock heating ( e.g. , birnboim & dekel 2003 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; khochfar & ostriker 2007 ) or feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; croton et  al .",
    "2006 ; hopkins et  al . 2006 ) truncates star - formation in halos above a critical mass , and this mass scale should be observable with a well constrained hod .",

    "our choice of cosmology is similar to the wmap-3 cosmology ( spergel et  al .",
    "2007 ) and matches the @xmath19 dark matter simulation we used to generate mock galaxy catalogs . for the analytic calculation of the hod (  [ sec : hod ] ) , we define halos as spherical objects where the mean density within the sphere is 200 times that of the background . for the mock catalogs ,",
    "halos are identified using a friends - of - friends algorithm which is discussed in detail in appendix b. we denote base ten logarithms with @xmath20 and natural logarithms with @xmath21 .",

    "the only significant difference between this work and ( 2007 ) is that we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath14 and @xmath22 rather than @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this cosmology matches that of the @xmath25 dark matter simulation we use to generate mock galaxy catalogs ( appendix  [ sec : mock ] ) and is similar to the wmap-3 cosmology ( spergel et  al .",

    "for this paper , we only include objects which are detected within nominal subfield boundaries .",
    "the subfields have small overlaps and we remove duplicate object detections from these regions .",

    "the final sample area is @xmath39 over a @xmath40 field - of - view .",
    "we measured aperture photometry for each object using our own code .",
    "sextractor segmentation maps were used to exclude flux associated with neighboring objects .",
    "we corrected the photometry for missing pixels ( e.g. , bad pixels ) using the mean flux per pixel measured in a series of annuli surrounding each object .",
    "uncertainties were determined by measuring photometry at @xmath41 positions within @xmath42 of the object position and finding the uncertainty which encompassed 68% of the measurements .",

    "we determined redshifts for our galaxies using the empirical annz photometric redshift code ( firth , lahav , & somerville 2003 ; collister & lahav 2004 ) .",
    "annz uses artificial neural networks to determine the relationship between measured galaxy properties and redshift .",
    "it does not use any prior assumptions about the shape of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , though it does assume the relationship between observed galaxy properties and redshift is a relatively smooth function .",
    "the basis of our training set is galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in botes .",
    "the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , c.  s.  kochanek  et  al .  in preparation ) has obtained spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath43 @xmath44 galaxies , while several hundred additional redshifts are available from a variety of programs with 4 and 8  m - class telescopes . at @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "there are relatively few galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , so we added artificial galaxies to the training set by ( at fixed redshift ) interpolating in color and extrapolating in luminosity .",

    "this criterion allows comparison with the recent literature and is similar to the criterion of ( 2004 ) .",
    "we also applied apparent color cuts to remove contaminants while not significantly reducing sample completeness , and these are discussed in detail in ( 2007 ) .",

    "we select our sample using absolute magnitude criteria , so our sample size is 4% larger than that of ( 2007 ) . while these changes are small , they are comparable to our random uncertainties , so we present revised measurements of the red galaxy luminosity function and luminosity density here .",
    "our methodology for measuring the luminosity function is very similar to that of ( 2007 ) .",

    "fractional uncertainties derived from mocks are on the order of 10% , and can be 50% larger than those determined with subsamples .    to quantify the evolution of stellar mass within the red population , we measure the luminosity density ( the luminosity weighted integral of the luminosity function ) . to determine the @xmath75-band luminosity density ( @xmath76 ) we sum over the galaxy catalog ( @xmath77 ) at each redshift bin , apply corrections for sample incompleteness , and divide by the volume of the relevant redshift slice .",
    "galaxies fainter than our magnitude limits contribute up to @xmath78 of the luminosity density , and we include their contribution using an analytic approximation of the hod (  [ sec : analytic ] ) .",

    "the overall evolution of the luminosity function is very similar to that reported by ( 2007 ) and our principal conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "the luminosity density decreases by only @xmath79 between @xmath3 and @xmath80 , while the @xmath75-band luminosity of an aging stellar population fades by a factor of 3 over the same redshift range .",
    "we thus conclude that the stellar mass within the red galaxy population has increased by @xmath81 since @xmath3 .",
    "mergers of red galaxies ( without accompanying star - formation ) do not increase the stellar mass contained within the red population . as there is little star - formation within the red population , the increase in stellar mass must result from stellar mass",

    "2007 ; faber et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "the transfer of stellar mass from the blue galaxy population into the red galaxy population will have little impact on the space density of the most luminous red galaxies unless significant merging takes place , as very massive blue galaxies are rare at @xmath8 ( e.g. , bell et  al .",

    "we thus conclude that there is ongoing assembly of massive galaxies at @xmath8 , albeit at a rate that only increases their stellar masses by @xmath6 between @xmath3 and @xmath80 .",
    "the spatial correlation function of galaxies is one of the principal constraints on the hod . in particular , the clustering of galaxies on scales less than @xmath85 is a strong function of the number of satellite galaxies residing within halos .",
