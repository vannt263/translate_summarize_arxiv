    "it is becoming clear that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the center of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may play an important role in galaxy evolution through a process known as `` feedback '' ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; veilleux et al .",

    "2015 ; nardini et al .",

    "is commonly referred to as `` quasar '' or `` radio '' mode feedback ( e.g. , fabian 2012 ; king & pounds 2015 ) .",
    "however , several fundamental questions are still open : what is the origin of the difference between feedback by radio - quiet and radio - loud agn ?",
    "why and how is the radio - quiet and radio - loud phase linked to the galaxy type and large - scale environment ?",
    "is feedback different for isolated , group or cluster galaxies ?",
    "the investigation of the complex environment surrounding agn may shed light on some of these fundamental issues ( e.g. , ineson et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "absorption from layers of photoionized gas in the circumnuclear regions of agn is commonly observed in seyfert galaxies and quasars .",
    "this material can be observed in the x - ray spectra through blue - shifted absorption lines from various elements over a wide range of ionizations , column densities , and velocities .",
    "the parameters of these winds range from log@xmath5@xmath104  erg  s@xmath7  cm , @xmath13@xmath14  @xmath10 and @xmath11@xmath151001000  km  s@xmath7 for the so - called `` warm absorbers '' ( was ) ( e.g. , halpern 1984 ; nandra & pounds 1992 ; reynolds 1997 ; crenshaw & kraemer 2012 ; tombesi et al . 2013a ; kaastra et al .",

    "the ionization parameter is defined as @xmath5@xmath0@xmath18 erg  s@xmath7  cm ( tarter , tucker & salpeter 1969 ) where @xmath19 is the ionizing luminosity between 1 ryd and 1000 ryd ( 1 ryd @xmath0 13.6 ev ) , @xmath20 is the number density of the material , and @xmath21 is the distance of the gas from the central source . their origin and acceleration mechanisms of these winds are still debated ( fukumura et al .",

    "thus , contrary to the jet dichotomy , it seems that winds may be present in both luminous radio - quiet and radio - loud agn .",
    "indeed , from a theoretical point of view , winds are expected in radio - loud agn as ingredients for jet formation ( blandford & payne 1982 ) and the relativistically moving jet plasma should be enveloped in a sub - relativistic wind , possibly helping the initial collimation of the jet ( mckinney 2006 ; fukumura et al .",

    "moreover , spectral features indicating reflection from the inner accretion disk and the parsec scale torus or broad line region have been identified in some high signal - to - noise spectra of radio galaxies .",
    "they appear to be similar but weaker than in seyfert galaxies , possibly indicating a different disk ionization state , lower column densities , lower covering fraction or a different illumination from the base of the jet ( e.g. , sambruna et al .",

    "the dichotomy between radio - quiet and radio - loud agn is still not fully understood , but it seems that the latter host more massive black holes , and are more preferentially found in elliptical galaxies and mergers ( e.g. , chiaberge et al .  2011 , 2015 ) .",
    "one related possibility is also that the agn is connected through feeding and feedback with the large - scale environment and , therefore , both the black hole and the host galaxy are linked to each other .",
    "for instance , elliptical galaxies are known to possess a hot interstellar medium ( ism ) with temperature of the order of @xmath3@xmath150.11  kev ( werner et al .  2009 ; kim & pellegrini 2012 ) . dozens or more soft x - ray emission lines , particularly a forest of fe l lines ,",
    "is expected to provide the main cooling mechanism ( e.g. , xu et al .",
    "2002 ; werner et al .",
    "the physical properties of such hot ism may be directly related to the formation and evolution of these systems , via star formation episodes , the passive evolution of their aging stellar population , environmental effects such as stripping , infall , and mergers , and the growth of supermassive black holes ( see kim & pellegrini 2012 for a review ) .    for the first time , we show the analysis 150  ks _ chandra _ hetg observation of the blrg 3c  390.3 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the unique capabilities of the _ chandra _ hetg of combining high energy resolution and high sensitivity in the wide e@xmath00.57  kev band are crucial for the detection of emission and absoprtion lines from a wide range of ionization species .",
    "the _ chandra _ hetg observation of 3c  390.3 is composed of three exposures performed within one month in 2014 for a total of 150  ks , see table  1 for details .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the _ ciao _ package v4.7 and the associated caldb ( updated to march 2015 ) .",
    "only the first order dispersed spectra are considered for both the meg ( medium energy grating ) and heg ( high energy grating ) and the @xmath261 orders for each grating were subsequently combined for each sequence .",
    "no significant spectral variability is observed between the three exposures and the spectra are consistent with only minor @xmath14% variations in source count rate .",
    "therefore , the spectra were combined from all three sequences to yield a single 1st order spectrum for each of the meg and heg .",
    "the background count rate is negligible .",
    "the resultant spectra were subsequently binned to @xmath27  and @xmath28  bins for meg and heg respectively , which match their full width half maximum ( fwhm ) spectral resolution .",
    "the meg and heg spectra were analyzed in the observer frame energy intervals e@xmath00.57  kev and e@xmath017.5  kev , respectively .",
    "the analysis of the background subtracted source spectra was performed using _ xspec _ v.12.8.2 and the c - statistic was applied .",

    "a possible soft excess component is also not required by the data .",
    "an inspection of the data in fig .  1 shows the possible presence of emission and absorption residuals in both the soft x - ray and fe k bands    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 we observe three emission features in the energy range between e@xmath00.70.85  kev .",
    "the energy and width of the first emission line at e@xmath1734  ev suggest an interpretation as the doublet fe  xvii 2p@xmath343s at e@xmath0727  ev and e@xmath0739  ev , respectively .",
    "we note that the energy of this feature is also consistent with the o  vii rrc at e@xmath0739  ev ( e.g. , liedahl & paerels 1996 ) . however , this latter interpretation is less likely because there are no other lines detected in the present spectrum that can be associated with o  vii .",

    "however , we note that the apparent absence of a related strong o  viii ly@xmath2 line seem to rule out a significant contribution from o  viii ly@xmath35 . finally , there is indication of a fainter emission feature at e@xmath1808  ev which can be associated with the fe  xvii 2p@xmath343d doublet at e@xmath0802  ev and e@xmath0812  ev , respectively .",

    "the estimates of the bolometric luminosity of the agn and the radio jet power are @xmath109  erg  s@xmath7 and @xmath110  erg  s@xmath7 , respectively ( torresi et al .",
    "therefore , the mechanical power of the wa is negligible , being lower than 0.001% and 0.01% of the bolometric luminosity and jet power , respectively .",
    "therefore , the large - scale wa does not seem to provide a significant agn feedback effect in 3c  390.3 , unless it is interpreted as the remnant of the shock interaction between the disk wind and the interstellar medium ( e.g. , pounds & king 2013 ; king & pounds 2014 ) .",
    "a ufo with velocity @xmath11@xmath10.15c was detected in 3c  390.3 ( tombesi et al .",
    "2010b , 2014 ; gofford et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "the lower and upper limits on the distance , mass outflow rate and mechanical power are @xmath111@xmath10.0020.02  pc , @xmath104@xmath1212  @xmath112  yr@xmath7 and @xmath113@xmath1@xmath114@xmath115  erg  s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we note that the mass outflow rate of the ufo is comparable to that estimated for the wa .",
    "the mechanical power of the ufo is indeed high enough to provide agn feedback in this source , with a value comparable to that of the radio jet ( tombesi et al .",
    "2014 ; gofford et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray emission lines indicate the presence of hot diffuse gas with a temperature of @xmath3@xmath10.5  kev .",
    "this temperature is consistent with the typical value observed for the hot ism in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , werner et al .",
    "2009 ; kim & pellegrini 2012 ) . the normalization of the _ apec _ component is defined as @xmath116 ^ 2)$ ] , where @xmath117  cm is the angular diameter distance to the source .",
    "the emission measure @xmath90 is defined as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the electron and hydrogen number densitites in @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "given the normalization of the _ apec _ component reported in table  3 , we can estimate an emission measure of @xmath121 @xmath91 .",
    "values of the emission measure of order @xmath122 @xmath91 were reported also for several elliptical galaxies observed with the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( werner et al .",
    "assuming that the plasma is fully ionized , @xmath123 , and considering a roughly spherical volume of radius @xmath11.5kpc corresponding to the extension of the region observed with the hetg of @xmath12  , we obtain a number density for the gas of @xmath124  @xmath91 .",
    "the temperature , density and extension of the gas are indeed consistent with the values expected for the hot ism in elliptical galaxies ( xu et al .",
    "2002 ; werner et al .  2009 ; kim & pellegrini 2012 ) .    most elliptical and other early - type galaxies possess a hot and diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the ism temperature ranges from e@xmath10.5 to e@xmath11  kev ( e.g. , matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) so that most of the emission is radiated in the soft x - ray band .",
    "elliptical galaxies , and giant elliptical galaxies in particular , are the most massive and the oldest stellar systems in the universe .",
    "the central regions of elliptical galaxies should exhibit strong cooling flows ( e.g. , nulsen , stewart , & fabian 1984 ) .",
    "however , such cooling flows are hardly observed , indicating that the cooling of the gas is counterbalanced by other mechanisms , possibly related to stellar winds , supernovae or agn wind / jets ( e.g. , xu et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the cooling flow problem in elliptical galaxies can be regarded as a scaled - down version of the similar process in galaxy clusters .",
    "the study of radio galaxies in the x - ray band is therefore an important `` laboratory '' for cluster physics and agn feedback at scales of isolated galaxies or galaxy groups .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity estimated for the hot ism in 3c  390.3 is @xmath125@xmath1@xmath126  erg  s@xmath7 . in order to keep the gas hot and prevent a catastrophic cooling flow",
    ", there must be some source of energy .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the cooling timescale for the hot gas associated with the galaxy can be estimated as @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the internal energy of the gas and @xmath125 is the luminosity .",
    "the internal egergy of the gas is defined as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the total number of particles and @xmath131 is the gas temperature . for a particle density of @xmath132 @xmath133 and considering a spherical region of radius @xmath15@xmath134  kpc and temperature @xmath135  k , then we obtain @xmath136 ergs . considering the luminosity @xmath137 ergs  s@xmath7 for the hot ism , then the cooling time is significantly shorter than a gyr .",
    "even this rough estimate already suggests that an additional source of heating is required to keep the plasma in an approximate equilibrium .",
    "the agn at the center of this galaxy has three possible ways to inject energy in the ism , through the observed warm absorber , the ultrafast outflow and the radio jet .",
    "the kinetic energy of these outflows is in the range @xmath138 erg  s@xmath7 , @xmath113@xmath139 erg  s@xmath7 , and @xmath140  erg  s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the kinetic energy in the warm absorber is at least one order of magnitude below the one required . instead ,",
    "even if just @xmath11% of the energy from the ultrafast outflow or the jet are deposited in the ism , this is enough to counterbalance the cooling .",
    "therefore , it is likely that these two components may provide an important contribution in the balance between heating and cooling in this source .    assuming the possible distance of @xmath151  kpc",
    ", then we derive that the density of the warm absorber material , @xmath141@xmath150.1 @xmath91 , is comparable to the one derived for the emitting ism .",
    "therefore , the fact that the emission component is better described by collisional ionization can be probably attributed to the fact that we are looking directly down the ionization cone of this source and that the agn only photoionizes along the unobscured cone , vertical to the obscuring torus .",
    "this is overall consistent with the angle - dependent unified picture of agn ( e.g. , antonucci 1984 , 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the most intense emission feature in the fe k band at e@xmath16.4  kev is likely associated with the fe k@xmath2 fluorescent line .",
    "the best - fit is provided by a lowly ionized _ xillver _ component with log@xmath5@xmath11.3  erg  s@xmath7  cm , see table  3 . the line is resolved and a broadening of @xmath30@xmath0@xmath88  ev is required .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity broadening of fwhm@xmath0@xmath142  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with the width of the h@xmath2 line in the optical , corroborating the previously suggested origin of this feature as reflection from the broad line region or the outer accretion disk ( e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "2009 ; zhang 2013 ) .",
    "indeed , we note that also the optical h@xmath2 emission line in this source has a broad , complex double - peaked profile with a narrow core and broad wings ( sambruna et al .  2009 )",
    ". the signal - to - noise of the data is not enough to significantly investigate the presence of a possible additional broad reflection component associated with the inner accretion disk .",
    "we find marginal evidence for a fe  xxv emission line indicating the presence of an additional higher ionization component with ionization parameter log@xmath5@xmath13.5 erg  s@xmath7  cm .",
    "increasing evidence for such ionized fe k emission lines has been reported in the spectra of both radio - quiet and radio - loud agn ( e.g. , bianchi et al .  2005 ; tombesi et al .  2010a , b ; patrick et al .",
    "2012 ; lohfink et al .",
    "2012 ; tombesi et al .",
    "the origin of such features is still unclear , possibly being associated with disk winds , extended photoionied gas or disk reflection .",
    "longer exposure observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ will help shed light on these features . a fundamental improvement in the study such narrow fe k features will be provided by future x - ray calorimeter missions ( e.g. , nandra et al .  2013 ; takahashi et al .",
    "we report for the first time the analysis of the 150ks _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of the radio galaxy 3c  390.3 .",
    "the spectrum shows complex emission and absorption features in both the soft x - rays and the fe k band .",
    "in particular , there is evidence for ( i ) a hot emission component likely associated with the hot ism in this elliptical galaxy , ( ii ) a warm absorber located in the range between 0.253.5  kpc , and ( iii ) lowly ionized reflection in the fe k band likely associated with the optical broad line region or the outer accretion disk , with a hint of a higher ionization component .",
    "this is the first case in which these three components have been simultaneously observed in a normal elliptical galaxy hosting a luminous agn with a powerful relativistic jet and accretion disk winds .",
