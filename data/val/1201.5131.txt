    "anisotropic particles are compelling building blocks for self - assembled materials because their directional interactions can be exploited to create complicated and useful patterns @xcite .",
    "one way to create anisotropic building blocks is to self - assemble them from simpler particles , where the building block represents a free - energy minimizing structure .",

    "colloidal spheres are attractive candidates for assembly because they can be made from a wide variety of polymers and metals , and their interaction potentials can be tuned with organic ligands , solvents , and salts .    here",
    "we consider a class of self - limiting , or `` terminal '' , colloidal clusters created by self - assembling a small population of one type of particle , the `` halo '' particle ( hp ) , around a second type of particle , the central particle ( cp ) .",
    "the clusters are terminal because the only attractive interaction is between the hp and cp , which are dilute in the fluid of hp , and therefore steric restrictions among co - adsorbed hps inhibit further growth .",
    "the resulting clusters have structures determined by the interactions among the adsorbed hps , which self - organize around the cp to minimize their free energy .",
    "arrangements of hps on the surface of a cp have been studied extensively by mathematicians in the context of optimal arrangements of points on a sphere@xcite .",
    "the solutions provide a library of anisotropic clusters that can in principle be created with properly designed interactions among the constituent particles . in this work",
    "we study hard sphere hps that are attractive only to dilute cps and not to other hps , thereby producing clusters of hps around a single cp .",
    "the arrangements of these hps bear comparison to a particular set of solutions , the _ spherical codes _ , for certain ratios of particle diameters .",
    "we investigate the self - assembly of these clusters as a function of temperature , where entropy controls the equilibrium structure of the cluster , and in a semi - open system , where hp are free to bind and unbind from the cp surface .",
    "we also consider the effect of temperature on the cluster structures and dynamics at deviations from the perfectly dense packings that correspond to solutions of the spherical code .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "we find that terminal @xmath0-clusters self assemble across a range of diameters and temperatures and the structure of these clusters resemble spherical code solutions .",

    "there are a number of ways the sticky sphere assembly method described above can be extended to create interesting new species of anisotropic particles .",
    "for example , we can now ponder a more general question . given a desired arrangement of points",
    ", what hp - cp interactions and hp - hp interactions will result in self - assembly of the arrangement ?",
    "the analogous mathematical question was posed by l.l .",
    "whyte in 1952 , _ _",
    "`` what spherical arrangements [ of points ] possess extremal properties of any kind?''__@xcite ideally , we seek hp - hp interactions and hp - cp interactions that self - assemble repeatable and desirable patterns of hps on the cp .",
    "cohn and kumar@xcite show that all potential energy functions of distance that are completely monotonic , such as inverse power laws , share a subset of universally optimal solution configurations . if the function is strictly completely monotonic , then the universally optimal solution is also unique . for points on the surface of a sphere ,",
    "the only known universally optimal solutions are @xcite @xmath0 = 1 - 4 , 6 , and 12 ; that is , a single point , antipodal points , points forming an equilateral triangle on the equator , and tetrahedral , octahedral , and icosahedral arrangement of points . for our purposes , this means certain desired point arrangements ( e.g. a ring of 12 points distributed around the equator of a sphere such as modeled in reference @xcite ) are likely to be inherently difficult to achieve from hp - hp interactions . restricting themselves to isotropic pair potentials and identical particles , cohn and kumar@xcite constructed separate decreasing convex potential energy functions that have cubic ( n=8 ) and dodecahedral ( n=20 ) configurations as their minimum .",
    "thus references @xcite imply that to assemble certain clusters , it will be necessary to use more complicated hps with carefully constructed potentials , including non - completely monotonic or anisotropic interactions .",
    "using an alternative approach , complex clusters may also be possible by simply adding stages to the assembly process .",
    "for example , if , after the terminal @xmath0-cluster of fig .  [ makingpatchyparticles ] is created , the bath of hps is replaced by a bath of new hps coated with the same complementary material as the cp , a second shell of spheres can be added to the first .",
    "the structure of this shell will also depend on the entropy and energy of the cluster at a given temperature .",
    "if the hps in the second shell preferentially sit in the interstices of the first shell , the polyhedron they form will be the _ dual _ of the polyhedron of the first shell .",
    "this can make new types of point arrangements possible .",
    "for example , the dual of the octahedron is the cube .",
    "a cubic arrangement of eight points on the surface of a sphere is not found as a minimum among most common spherical surface functions@xcite . a second shell of hps that preferentially assemble the dual of the first shell of hps may be a physically more viable method of assembling a cubic arrangement of spheres without requiring the elaborately constructed hp - hp interaction potential of cohn and kumar@xcite .",
    "the results presented here may also be used to guide the synthesis of reconfigurable @xmath3 clusters . as shown in section [ magic5 ] above ,",
    "a small change in the packing fraction of the @xmath3 cluster introduces a significant change in the structure of the cluster .",
    "thus , changing the effective diameter of the central particle by a modest amount induces a switch between a relatively isotropic disordered cluster and an anisotropic square pyramidal cluster .",
    "there may also be a correspondence between other mathematical sequences of points distributed on a sphere and terminal cluster assembly problems .",
    "for example in reference @xcite , clusters of cones and spheres were shown to form unique and precisely packed clusters arising from free energy minimization subject to a convexity constraint .",
    "the authors find a packing sequence identical to that obtained from minimizing the second moment of the mass distribution of a cluster of particles constrained to a convex hull .",
    "we observe that the packing sequence produced in @xcite also bears a strong resemblance to the distribution of points on the surface of a sphere that maximizes the convex hull @xcite.the authors further showed that sequence successfully describes the polyhedral structures formed by colloidal spheres self - assembling on an evaporating droplet@xcite .",
    "that work serves another example of the correspondence between mathematical solutions of extremal points on the surface of a sphere and cluster structures obtainable in experiments .    another interesting variant to consider is a shaped central particle , as was done in reference @xcite for the thomson problem . considering",
    "the packing of hp around a shaped cp may lead to novel clusters and is a generally unexplored problem .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that hard and sticky spheres can self - assemble into terminal @xmath0-clusters with interesting and , in some cases , unexpected , anisotropies .",
    "these clusters have predictable preferred structures that depend on temperature and sphere diameter ratio .",
    "we find that some clusters exhibit collective particle rearrangements , and these collective modes are unique to a given cluster size .",
    "if assembled directly from a bath at low temperature , certain cluster sizes ( e.g. @xmath196 ) form robustly , while other clusters occur only over small ranges with relatively mobile structures ( e.g. @xmath0 = 7,9,10 ) and still others can not be formed at all ( e.g. @xmath0 = 5,11 ) .",
    "a `` multi - step '' process that assembles the clusters from a bath at a higher temperature , removes the bath , and lowers the temperature may enable these hard - to - form clusters to be formed robustly as well .",
    "it may even be possible to adjust the effective diameter of the hp or cp as a step in the assembly process . our free energy calculations and brownian ( molecular ) dynamics predictions of cluster structure provide a guide for designing such a process for optimal yield of a desired cluster size with a well - ordered structure .",
    "clusters fabricated in this way may find use as building blocks for subsequent self - assembly , as templates for manufacturing precisely placed circular patches on the surface of a spherical particle , creating nanocolloidal cages , or fabricating reconfigurable particles .",
