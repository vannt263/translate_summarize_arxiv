    "ultracool subdwarfs ( ucsds ) are metal - deficient , very low mass stars and brown dwarfs with late spectral types .",
    "they are the metal - poor analogs of ultracool dwarfs ( spectral types m7 and later ) and represent the low effective temperature ( t@xmath0 @xmath1 3000  k ; @xcite ) extensions of the m subdwarf ( sdm ) and extreme subdwarf ( esdm ) classes @xcite .",
    "cool and ultracool subdwarfs typically exhibit halo kinematics , and were presumably formed early in the galaxy s history .",
    "these low mass objects are important tracers of galactic structure and chemical enrichment history and are representatives of the first generations of star formation .",
    "ucsds encompass the new spectral class of l subdwarfs ( sdl ; @xcite ) and metal - poor t dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , reaching masses below the hydrogen burning minimum mass .",
    "this contribution provides an update on the state of ucsd research since a first review was made at cool stars 13 by @xcite . here",
    "i focus on observed spectral properties ( @xmath22 ) , new discoveries ( @xmath23 ) and considerations for spectral classification ( @xmath24 ) , and then briefly touch on other issues under investigation ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "like ultracool dwarfs , ucsds exhibit complex optical and near - infrared spectral energy distributions dominated by strong , overlapping molecular absorption bands ; numerous neutral metal line features ; and red optical spectral continua ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "they are distinguished spectroscopically by signatures of metal deficiency , notably enhanced metal hydride and weakened metal oxide absorption bands @xcite , and blue near - infrared colors resulting from collision induced h@xmath3 absorption @xcite .",
    "these spectral peculiarities are more pronounced in lower metallicity subdwarfs ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the reduction in tio and vo opacity at optical wavelengths allows for the emergence of several weaker lines not generally seen in solar metallicity m dwarfs , including ca  i , ca  ii , rb  i , and ti  i. the smooth continuum opacity of h@xmath3 results in damped h@xmath3o and co bands at near - infrared wavelengths , so the latest - type and most metal - poor ucsds exhibit bland spectral energy distributions longward of 1.5 @xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure 1 ) .",
    "@xcite have recently presented high resolution spectra for ucsds , providing the first rotational velocity and accurate radial velocity measurements for these sources .",
    "the high @xmath5 = 65@xmath615  km / s of the l subdwarf 2mass  j0532 + 8246 @xcite suggests that the lowest mass halo stars may not lose their angular momentum as efficiently as more massive stars .",
    "they also find that one of the first l subdwarfs to be identified , lsr  1610 - 0040 @xcite , has mixed m dwarf and subdwarf spectral features , a conclusion also reached by @xcite on the basis of near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "this source appears to be peculiar , even among the small number of ucsds now known .",
    "@xcite provides a compendium of 16 currently known ucsds , an increase of 60% since cool stars 13 .",
    "this increase has been driven by new proper motion search programs using red optical photographic plate surveys ( e.g. , superblink , @xcite ; and the supercosmos sky survey [ sss ] , @xcite ) and serendipitous discoveries in near - infrared catalogs such as 2mass .",
    "new discoveries include two ultracool extreme subdwarfs @xcite , tripling the number of known ultracool esdms ; and a new l subdwarf , sdss 1256 - 0224 , reported by @xcite .",
    "while red optical proper motion surveys have been successful , the spectral energy distributions of cooler ucsds peak around 1  @xmath4 ( a balance of reduced t@xmath0 and increased absorption by h@xmath3 ; see figure  1 ) , so near - infrared measurements become increasingly useful .",
    "indeed , the ukidss survey with its 1  @xmath4 @xmath7-band should be highly sensitive to ucsds @xcite .",
    "the recent inception of near - infrared proper motion surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ; j.  d.  kirkpatrick , 2007 , in prep . ) will likely expand the known ucsd population substantially in the near term .",
    "spectral types for ucsds are currently based on extrapolations of schemes developed for earlier - type m subdwarfs @xcite , based on tio and cah bands in the 62007300   region .",
    "these features become inadequate in the ucsd regime as tio and cah bands decline due to condensation ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; wide , pressure - broadened na  i and k  i lines suppress adjacent features @xcite ; and the sources themselves become exceedingly faint at optical wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite have suggested the use of the same red optical features used to classify l dwarfs as diagnostics for ucsd classification , and the direct comparison of l subdwarf spectra to l dwarf spectral standards ( see figure  2 ) . at near - infrared wavelengths , useful diagnostics are largely limited to the @xmath8-band region ( figure  1 ) , and work is progressing in this direction ( burgasser et al . , in prep . ) .    an issue to consider in the classification of ucsds",
    "is the division of metallicity classes .",
    "strong , blanketing molecular bands results in greater spectral sensitivity to metallicity and chemistry effects .",
    "the current population of ucsds may already span a fairly broad range of metallicities , as suggested by comparisons to atmospheric models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  2 above ) ; and the metallicities of early - type sdms may not ( and perhaps need not ) correspond to those of late - type sdms and sdls . in addition , even slightly metal - poor ( [ m / h ] @xmath9 -0.5 ) `` mild '' ucsds are spectrally distinct ( figure  1 ) , and a `` d / sd '' designation for these objects has been suggested .",
    "this group would encompass slightly metal - poor t dwarfs , distinguished by depressed @xmath10-band peaks ( due to h@xmath3 absorption ) and enhanced @xmath7-band peaks ( possibly related to the red wing of the k  i doublet at 0.77  @xmath4 ; @xcite ) ; and several recent discoveries of so - called `` blue '' l dwarfs @xcite that may also be metal - poor .",
    "i briefly summarize other issues that have arisen in recent studies of ucsds .",
    "the interested reader is encouraged to examine the literature for further discussion .    _",
    "dust formation : _ one of the defining properties of l field dwarfs is the formation of condensate dust in their photospheres , driving the depletion of gaseous tio , vo , cah , al  i , ca  i and ti  i in the photosphere @xcite .",
    "however , several late - type subdwarfs exhibit features from these species when it is absent in their dwarf counterparts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  2 above ) .",
    "their persistence suggests that condensate formation may be inhibited in metal - poor atmospheres ; chemical modeling of this effect is needed .",
    "_ spectral modeling : _ attempts to derive physical properties for ucsds based on spectral model fits have met with mixed results ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulties stem from the same issues that arise when modeling ultracool dwarf spectra ; e.g. , complex molecular opacities , and chemistry and condensate grain formation .",
    "there are new concerted efforts to develop better metal - poor atmosphere models in the ucsd regime ( @xcite ; schweitzer , hauschildt & wawrzyn , these proceedings ) . _",
    "binaries : _ binary systems are useful laboratories for studying detailed properties , testing formation theories and finding low temeprature sources as companions ( see splinter session overview by h.  bouy ) . there have been a couple of studies targeting m subdwarfs for companions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gelino & kirkpatrick , these proceedings ) with as yet no reported ucsd discoveries .",
    "_ distance measurements : _ these are perhaps the most crucial observations needed , as only two ucsds have reported parallaxes .",
    "such measurements make possible the construction of absolute magnitude , luminosity and t@xmath0 scales , and facilitate comparisons to spectral and structural models .",
