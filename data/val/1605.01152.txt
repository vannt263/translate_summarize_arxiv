    "@xcite for recent reviews ) . based on a recent analysis on the mass distribution of a number of pulsars with secure mass measurement",
    ", it is found that @xmath2 @xmath3 2.1 @xmath4 is an established lower bound value on maximum mass @xmath5 for ns , and the existence of more massive nss with @xmath2 @xmath3 2.5 @xmath4 is , in principle , possible  @xcite .",
    "the evidences of massive ns with accurate measurement , for example , are obtained from the recent observation of pulsar j1614 - 2230 from shapiro delay @xcite with the mass @xmath6 and pulsar j0348 + 0432 from the gravitational redshift of its white dwarf companion @xcite with the mass @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , there are also evidences that some black widow pulsars might have higher masses .",
    "for example , pulsar b1957 + 20 reportedly has a mass of @xmath2 = 2.4 @xmath8 0.12 @xmath4  @xcite , and even gamma - ray black widow pulsar j1311 - 3430  @xcite has higher mass but less accurate mass than that of b1957 + 20 . on the other hand , accurate measurements of the ns radii ,",
    "if existing , would also provide important information .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis methods used to extract ns radii from observational data still have high uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the limits of recent observational radii from different sources or even from the same source are often in contradictory to one another  @xcite .",
    "however , it is remarkable that a neutron star with radius @xmath9 = 10.7 - 13.1 km of canonical mass , is reported to be consistent with other observational analysis and the host of experimental data for finite nuclei  @xcite .    in many works , the mass and radius of neutron stars",
    "are usually used to constrain the equation of state of matter at high densities by assuming the general relativity ( gr ) theory as an ultimate theory of gravitation .",
    "if accurate measurement of ns with the mass of greater than 2.4 @xmath4 is possible in the future , within gr this constraint means the eos of the corresponding ns should be very stiff .",
    "this fact is quite difficult to reconcile with possible existence of exotics such as hyperons in ns core and small measured radius that both favor soft eos .",
    "whereas , all nuclear models that are compatible with the experimental data on hyper - nuclei predict the existence of hyperons in matter at the density of exceeding 2 - 3 times nuclear saturation density ( @xmath10 ) ( see refs .",

    "this problem is known as `` the hyperon puzzle '' ( see ref .",

    "<S> we investigate the mass - radius relation of neutron star ( ns ) with hyperons inside its core by using the eddington - inspired born - infeld ( eibi ) theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state of the star is calculated by using the relativistic mean field model under which the standard su(6 ) prescription and hyperons potential depths are used to determine the hyperon coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> we found that , for @xmath0 , the corresponding ns mass and radius predicted by the eibi theory of gravity is compatible with observational constraints of maximum ns mass and radius . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath1 value is also compatible with the @xmath1 range predicted by the astrophysical - cosmological constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the parameter @xmath1 could control the size and the compactness of a neutron star .    </S>",
