    "local openings of the dna double helix are required in several biological functions , for instance transcription and replication .",
    "these local separations of the two dna strands are mediated by a specific machinery in the cell . in order to deal with such complex processes ,",
    "it is necessary first to understand the interactions keeping together the two complementary strands within a single dna duplex , as well as the properties of fluctuating dna openings in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this fact has been realized long time ago and base - pairing interactions and the thermal stability of the double helix have been conventionally probed by increasing temperature up to the dna denaturation transition @xcite .",
    "base - pair openings ( bubbles ) occur in dna due to thermal fluctuations even at temperatures well below the melting transition .",
    "it has been speculated that they may play a role in the recognition of specific dna sites by dna - binding proteins @xcite .",
    "recent experiments using a novel hairpin quenching technique have been able to show this bubble formation in the pre - melting regime and characterize it quantitatively @xcite . by increasing temperature these bubbles",
    "grow and more bubbles are nucleated , thus leading to the complete separation of the two strands at the denaturation transition .",
    "therefore statistical properties of dna bubbles in a wide temperature regime , extending from biological temperatures up to the melting transition , are of particular interest .",
    "the purpose of this work is the investigation of the distribution of bubble lengths and its temperature dependence for dna sequences containing different percentages of guanine - cytosine ( gc ) base - pairs .",
    "the study is performed in the framework of the peyrard - bishop - dauxois ( pbd ) model @xcite , from where conjectures are drawn about the actual distributions of bubbles in dna .",
    "if our results on the temperature dependence of this distribution , obtained for finite bubble lengths , remain qualitatively valid in the asymptotic regime ( for very large values of bubble lengths ) , then there would be a connection with the ongoing discussion about the interpretation of the dna overstretching observed in force - extension experiments . in this case the possibilities of either a force - induced melting or the existence of a double - stranded elongated dna phase ( the so called s - dna ) have been proposed to explain the abrupt elongation of dna at forces @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is briefly discussed in the concluding section .    in a recent study",
    "we have presented the distribution of bubble lengths in the pbd model of dna at @xmath2k and we found that it can be described by a power - law modified exponential @xcite .",
    "anharmonic interactions between complementary bases forming base - pairs are responsible for the observed non - exponential distribution . the same form of distribution has been derived in the framework of the poland - scheraga model @xcite , which represents a completely different theoretical approach of dna denaturation than the pbd model that we use in our calculations .",
    "this distribution is also found for a primitive version of the pbd model , viz .",
    "the peyrard - bishop model @xcite with linear stacking interactions , but in this case the characteristic values of the parameters of the distribution are different @xcite .    here",
    "we examine how the bubble length distribution varies with temperature and present its complete dependence on both temperature and the gc fraction of the dna segment .",
    "the pbd model @xcite is used for the description of base - pair openings , where a set of continuous variables @xmath3 represent the base - pair displacements from equilibrium distance and the index @xmath4 labels the base - pairs along the dna chain .",
    "the potential energy of the system consists of two parts : the on - site interaction @xmath5 within each base - pair and the stacking interaction @xmath6 between adjacent base - pairs .",
    "a morse potential is used for the on - site energy , @xmath7 where the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 distinguish between gc and at base - pairs ( @xmath10ev , @xmath11@xmath12 for a gc base - pair and @xmath13ev , @xmath14@xmath12 for an at pair ) , while a nonlinear potential describes the stacking interaction , @xmath15 with @xmath16ev / @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19@xmath12 .",
    "we use parameter values from previous works @xcite .",
    "these parameters have been originally obtained from empirical fits to experimental data @xcite and are also able to successfully describe other experimental situations @xcite .",
    "entropic effects of dna are described from the pbd hamiltonian when studying its thermodynamics , leading to an entropy driven melting transition @xcite .    the efficiency of the rather simple pbd model to describe base - pair openings in dna has led to its extensive use in the literature @xcite . in particular",
    ", our choice of the pbd model for the study of bubble length distributions is motivated by the success of the model @xcite in reproducing experimental measurements of bubble formation @xcite , as well as the accurate description at a quantitative level of melting curves in short dna segments @xcite .",
    "the coarse - grained description of the model allows the possibility to perform calculations with long sequences of up to tens of thousands of base pairs @xcite .",
    "moreover , the popular nearest neighbor model @xcite , which is very successful in describing the melting of short oligomers , does not reproduce well experimental data on intermediate states for longer sequences @xcite .",
    "compared to the more conventional modified ising type models used in the study of dna melting @xcite , the pbd model is qualitatively similar : the on - site potential of the pbd model is an extension of the _ magnetic field _ in the ising type models , while the nonlinear stacking potential in eq .",
    "( [ stacking ] ) corresponds to the interaction between neighboring spins and loop entropies in ising models .",
    "we expect our results for the pbd model to hold qualitatively also for the ising type models , since both models yield the same shape for the distribution of bubble sizes @xcite .",
    "considering a random dna sequence of a given gc percentage , @xmath20 , at equilibrium at temperature @xmath21 , we calculate the distribution per base - pair of bubble lengths @xmath22 , @xmath23 , by counting during monte carlo simulations of the dpb model the average occurrences of openings ( base - pair displacements ) larger than a fixed threshold @xmath24 at @xmath22 successive base - pairs . in each simulation a random sequence of 1000 base pairs is used in which the at or gc identity of each base pair is generated randomly under the constraint of a specified gc percentage .",
    "the properties of such random long sequences are not different from natural sequences , as we showed in previous work @xcite comparing the results for a segment from _ escherichia coli _ s _ gal _ promoter with those from a randomly generated sequence with the same gc percentage .",
    "the monte carlo simulation is performed using the metropolis algorithm @xcite , which is used first for thermalization and then for measurement runs .",
    "results are averaged over several realizations using the same random sequence and different initial conditions for the inter - base distance within each base - pair and for the random number generator .",
    "other details of the simulation ( number of realizations and monte carlo steps ) are as in ref . @xcite . since the used sequences are so long , the results are independent of the precise realization of the random sequence",
    ". we have run further simulations with different random sequences to assure this point .",
    "there is an issue about the dissociation observed in the pbd model in monte carlo simulations . in particular , due to the upper bound of the on - site potential for large positive displacements , for long enough simulations a complete dissociation would eventually occur at any temperature , even below the melting transition @xcite .",
    "however , because of the large dna segments considered here , the probability of a complete dissociation during the simulation time is so low that no such events were observed at any of the studied temperatures below the melting temperature .",
    "the threshold value considered for the openings is @xmath25 .",
    "results for different values of this threshold are qualitatively similar .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in dna segments of length 1000 base - pairs ( sufficiently larger than the studied bubble sizes ) and therefore our results refer to internal bubbles in long dna chains .",
    "the results are independent of the length of the studied sequence , provided that it is longer than the longest observed bubbles @xcite .",
    "this has been verified by simulations on dna segments of different length , resulting in the same distributions @xmath23 for the bubble sizes studied here , i.e. with @xmath22 up to about a hundred base - pairs . for short molecules ,",
    "the actual sequence does play a role , since it can trigger local openings in different regions at the end or in the middle of the sequence @xcite . in this case , the border effects associated can not be characterized only by the gc percentage of the short sequence , but this problem is out of the scope of the present work .",

    ", then this may be useful to understand experimental results in force - extension experiments . when performing single molecule experiments , force - extension curves of double stranded dna display hysteresis @xcite .",
    "the hysteresis observed is more pronounced at higher temperatures .",
    "the existence of an elongated double - stranded form of dna , called s - dna , has been proposed to explain the abrupt elongation of dna at a force of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of the force - extension problem @xcite suggest that the existence of s - dna is necessary to explain the temperature dependence of the observed hysteresis . however , an alternative explanation without the appearance of an s - dna phase is possible if the exponent @xmath0 is temperature dependent @xcite .",
    "the order of variation of @xmath0 we find here is in the right direction ( @xmath0 increases with temperature , implying larger hysteresis loops at high temperatures according to the experiments ) and of the necessary magnitude @xcite to explain the hysteresis effects observed . hence ,",
    "if the qualitative behavior of our results is valid in the asymptotic regime , this would have an effect on the ongoing debate about s - dna , favoring force - induced melting as an explanation for the dna elongation over the formation of an s - dna phase .",
    "interestingly , recent experimental results support the force - induced melting explanation @xcite , in agreement with the expectation from the temperature dependence of @xmath0 .    _",
