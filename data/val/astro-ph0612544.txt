    "figures [ fig_b23 ] and [ fig_a6 ] show our new data for slits c and d , respectively .",

    "many of the observed positions on the sky coincide to within @xmath71 pixel ( @xmath75 ) for slits c and d. we overplot the independently reduced spectra , at coincident spatial positions , on figures [ fig_b23 ] and [ fig_a6 ] .",
    "these independently reduced spectra at similar ( within @xmath85 ) spatial positions are the best assessment we can provide of the quality of our data , because we are primarily limited by systematics rather than by signal - to - noise .",
    "we highlight some of our main results in figure [ fig_newa ] .",
    "this figure illustrates two pairs of spectra at similar projected distances ( @xmath13 = 24  25  or @xmath13 = 49 ) from hd 200775 , but in different directions ( east or west ) .",
    "the continuum has been subtracted , by fitting a parabola to points well - separated from spectral emission features .",
    "figure [ fig_newa ] demonstrates that the ll2 spectra east and west of the star have striking differences even at the same projected distance from the star , and at the same gas phase ( neutral or molecular ) .",
    "the two western spectra are in the well - studied northwestern region of ngc 7023 containing narrow , bright filaments marking the pdr front there .",
    "the two eastern spectra are typical of the poorly - studied southeastern region of ngc 7023 , where we recently discovered the 18.9 @xmath0 m interstellar emission feature .",
    "the 16.4 @xmath0 m emission feature has the highest intensity ( in mjy sr@xmath14 ) of any emission feature in the 15  20 @xmath0 m spectra of ngc 7023 ( figs .",
    "[ fig_b15 ] , [ fig_b17 ] , [ fig_b23 ] , [ fig_a6 ] , and [ fig_newa ] ) . the 16.4 @xmath0 m feature emission , however , with its strong spatial correspondence with the northwest filaments in ngc 7023 , has much lower intensity east and southeast of the star .",
    "thus the 16.4 @xmath0 m feature becomes weaker than the 18.9 @xmath0 m feature in the two eastern spectra of figure [ fig_newa ] .",
    "figure [ fig_newa ] shows that the 18.9 @xmath0 m emission feature is very prominent in the eastern spectra , especially when compared to its relative weakness in western spectra at similar @xmath13 .",
    "this difference is observed at the southeast and northwest pdr fronts , as traced by h@xmath11 emission ( @xmath13 = 49 ) , and within the neutral h i gas ( @xmath13 = 24  25 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_newa ] shows that the 15.9 @xmath0 m feature is easily seen at @xmath13 = 49  nw , hinted at in the spectrum of @xmath13 = 24  nw , but is not detected at @xmath13 = 25  ne or @xmath13 = 49  se .",
    "we also conclude from figure [ fig_newa ] that the 17.8 @xmath0 m feature is observed only where the 16.4 @xmath0 m emission feature dominates the spectrum of ngc 7023 : @xmath13 = 24  49  nw . the 17.4 @xmath0 m feature is apparent in all spectra of figure [ fig_newa ] .",
    "its relative strength is difficult to estimate at this spectral resolution , due to strong blending with h@xmath11 , the 17.8 @xmath0 m feature , and probably at least one other feature ( see below ) .    at the spectral resolution of ll2 ( @xmath1 = 80  128 )",
    ", it is difficult to measure the relative strengths of individual emission features , particularly in the crowded 16  18 @xmath0 m spectral complex .",
    "still , there must be additional emission between the 16.4 @xmath0 m emission feature and the 17.4 @xmath0 m feature in order to explain the overall 16  18 @xmath0 m emission complex .",
    "@xcite fit this additional emission in ll2 spectra with a broad ( 1.1 @xmath0 m fwhm ) feature at 17.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "we attempted a similar fit to this additional emission in ngc 7023 , at the resolution of ll2 spectra , and were unable to find a unique fit .",
    "we examine this broad emission , underlying the 15.9 , 16.4 , 17.4 , and 17.8 @xmath0 m features , further in the next section using higher spectral resolution .",
    "we model our sh spectrum , in order to quantify the fwhm of each emission feature .",
    "we use a program called liner @xcite to fit multiple blended gaussians to the sh spectrum we observe .",
    "we illustrate our technique in figure [ shgauss ] .",
    "we also ran fits with lorentzian profiles @xcite , which are similar to the drude profiles used by @xcite ; our conclusions do not depend on whether a gaussian or lorentian profile is used .",
    "first , we use a routine within liner to interactively choose ranges of wavelengths for the continuum , as shown in figure [ shgauss ] .",
    "liner requires a minimum of two wavelength ranges , and a minimum of two wavelength points per wavelength range .",
    "the continuum for liner is equal to a parabolic fit to the spectrum in these wavelength ranges .",
    "second , we use another routine within liner to make initial guesses at the height , width , and center of each gaussian that is used to model each feature within the sh spectrum .",
    "we do not fit profiles to features whose peak intensities are less than 5% of the continuum intensity , taking this as the limit for possible calibration artifacts @xcite .",
    "third , we use an interactive plotting tool within liner to refine our guesses for the gaussian parameters of each feature .",
    "this routine plots the individual gaussians and the sum of the multi - gaussian fit , resulting from our refined guesses , plotted over the data .",
    "this routine also plots the residuals between the data and the fit to highlight where the model needs adjustment .",
    "this routine allows us to modify our refined guesses , by adding or subtracting features , or by changing a feature s central wavelength , peak intensity , or fwhm , in response to the quality of the model fit and its residuals .",
    "it is during this step that broader features , such as the 17.0 @xmath0 m feature , are better defined .",
    "we iterate within this routine , modifying the refined guesses , until we have fit the observed spectrum by eye as well as we can .",
    "fourth , we use a routine within liner which uses standard numerical techniques to search for best fit parameters for each feature ( modeled as a gaussian ) that minimizes the difference between the entire model fit and the observed spectrum , based on the refined guesses we provide .",
    "if the routine does not converge on a solution that is similar to our refined guesses , we repeat the process , modifying our initial and refined guesses , until we and the software concur on the fit .",
    "we show the resulting fit , using this technique , for our sh spectrum in figure [ shgauss ] .",
    "we illustrate the wavelength ranges for the continuum points , the derived continuum , the individual gaussians , the sum of the multi - gaussian fit , and the residuals plotted together with the original spectrum .",
    "the residuals are another measure of the uncertainty in our sh spectrum .",
    "we measure the central wavelength and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of emission features in our sh spectrum ( @xmath1 = 600 ) .",
    "we list these derived properties in table 1 .",
    "all emission features are resolved except for h@xmath11 .",
    "the wavelength calibration is uncertain for our sh spectrum , because it was acquired during pre - nominal operations .",
    "we therefore examine seven sh spectra @xmath158  from position b , from aor key 3871232 ( pid 28 ) .",
    "these spectra , obtained from a spectral map with short integration times per position , are noisier than our sh spectrum and so are not reduced beyond the pipeline products or presented here .",
    "these spectra , however , are sufficient to measure the central wavelengths and fwhms of all emission features except the 18.9 @xmath0 m emission feature .",
    "for the 18.9 @xmath0 m emission feature , we select the ten spectra with the highest signal - to - noise 18.9 @xmath0 m emission feature , from the entire spectral map , to measure the central wavelength and fwhm of the 18.9 @xmath0 m emission feature .",
