    "@xmath3 is the usual single particle tunneling , @xmath4 is the usual onsite interaction , and @xmath5 describe the off - site interaction .",
    "specifically , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the inter - well particle interaction , and @xmath8 is the site dependent effective tunneling .",
    "all these terms show up naturally provided that one expand the field operator in terms of the wannier basis and preserve all the terms . in the standard bose - hubbard model , the terms involving @xmath5",
    "are all neglected . here the inter - well particle interaction ( the last term in eqn .",
    "[ qh ] ) serves as an effective pair tunneling , which is the focus of this work . for ultracold dilute gases with short range interaction ,",
    "the contact interaction captures the essential physics , so we assume @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the @xmath11-wave scattering length , and thus @xmath12 .    below the transition temperature and for large particle number , the quantum model can be approximated by the mft . by replacing the creation and annihilation operators with complex numbers , one obtains the mft hamiltonian , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the ground state of this mean field hamiltonian has been studied in ref .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a pair of canonically conjugate variables , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "we focus on the repulsive interaction case and tune the ratio between pair tunneling and single particle tunneling , @xmath21 . in the weak pair tunneling regime , @xmath22 ,",
    "the ground state is the fixed point @xmath23 , which has equal population and zero relative phase between the wells . in the strong pair tunneling regime , @xmath24 ,",
    "the ground state becomes two - fold degenerate with @xmath25 , which has zero population imbalance but nonzero relative phase between the two wells .",
    "the transition between these two scenarios occurs at the critical value @xmath26 .",
    "our interest is in the connection between the quantum and mean field ground states .",
    "the quantum ground state can be obtained by diagonalizing the quantum hamiltonian eqn .",
    "( [ qh ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the mean field results , the quantum ground state is always real and non - degenerate no matter how strong the pair tunneling is . to elucidate and understand this subtle discrepancy",
    ", it is helpful to observe that the mean field ground state is actually the coherent state @xmath27 in the second quantized language .",
    "this allows us to calculate the inner product @xmath28 between the quantum ground state and the classical one . in usual cases without pair tunneling effect or weak pair tunneling regime ,",

    "the mean field ground state is two - fold degenerate and @xmath30 has two peaks.,width=347 ]    actually this state is the phase space analog of the self - trapping effect in a double - well potential for attractive particle interaction @xcite .",
    "the self - trapping effect occurs when the attraction between particles is strong enough , and then mft predicts that all the particles will spontaneously occupy only one well , breaking the symmetry of the double - well potential explicitly .",
    "the quantum ground state is known as the noon state , an equal superposition of particles occupying both wells , which in fact restores the symmetry . here in our model mft",
    "also gives two degenerate states breaking the symmetry of the potential , and the quantum ground state can be called the noon state in the phase space .",
    "our numerical solution of the quantum model shows when the mean field ground state becomes degenerate , the quantum energy levels exhibit the feature of quasi - degeneracy , where the energy gap between the lowest two states decreases exponentially with particle number ( see fig .",
    "[ low10 ] ) .",
    "the quasi - degeneracy indicates that the quantum ground state is unstable ; very small perturbation will mix up the quasi - degenerate states . for typical cold atomic system with particle number up to @xmath39",

    "@xmath41 decreases exponentially with @xmath42 when the pair tunneling is strong.,width=340 ]    the effective ground state is associated with the experimental observability of a ground state . as there is always all kinds of noise in experiments , what is observed experimentally may not be the true ground state of the system , but the effective one .",
    "a well - known example is the gas to solid phase transition in free space @xcite .",
    "since the center of mass momentum of the particles commutes with the whole hamiltonian , the absolute ground state should be the eigenstate of center of mass momentum , namely , particles should be distributed homogeneously in the whole space .",
    "however , in real world we always observe a localized solid .",
    "this is because the exact ground state is unstable against infinitesimal perturbation in the thermodynamic limit , and it will spontaneously decay into a symmetry - breaking effective ground state .",
    "the quantum time crystal @xcite proposed by wilczek is also such an effective ground state , whose existence needs the breaking of both translational and time reversal symmetries .",
    "suppose that we prepare one effective ground state .",
    "since it is not the true ground state of the system , it will evolve under the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "this process also determines the lifetime of the effective ground state observed in experiments . for this model ,",
    "we find that the effective ground state evolves almost periodically with the period @xmath46 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ evolve ] . as the energy gap @xmath41 between the first excited state and the ground state decreases with particle number @xmath42 as @xmath47",
    ", we have @xmath48 .",
    "so for large particle number , the evolution period is remarkably long , the system will always stay in the effective ground state during the course of experiments .     and @xmath49 . the profile @xmath30 has the same meaning as in fig .",
    "[ theta].,width=340 ]    from this simple model , we see clearly that the two fundamental concepts , ssb and effective ground state , are closely related .",
    "we take this opportunity to discuss their relation . in the perspective of effective ground state , there are two different types of ssb . in the first type ,",
    "the quantum ground state is degenerate ; therefore , the effective ground state is also degenerate . at low temperature",
    ", the system falls into one of the quantum degenerate states , breaking the symmetry .",
    "the well - known ferromagnetic ground state falls into this category .    in the second type of ssb ,",
    "the quantum ground state is unique while the effective ground state is degenerate . in these systems ,",
    "the degeneracy of the effective ground states arises from the quasi - degeneracy of the quantum energy levels : tiny perturbation can mix up these quasi - degenerate quantum states and generate these degenerate effective ground states , which are observed in experiments .",
    "interestingly , this category can be further divided into two subgroups as the quasi - degeneracy has two different origins : ( _ i _ ) the quasi - degeneracy of the quantum energy levels is caused by the large volume size of the system .",
    "the gas - solid transition mentioned above @xcite and the bose - einstein condensation of ideal gas @xcite are typical examples of this case .",
    "the degree of degeneracy in this subgroup is usually infinite .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the quasi - degeneracy of the quantum energy levels is due to the interaction in the system . for systems in this subgroup ,",
    "the energy gap usually decreases exponentially with particle number .",
    "our model belongs to this subgroup along with many other systems reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is a familiar and well - studied concept in condensed matter physics .",
    "however , it is still not fully understood .",
    "wen recently asked ,  what is spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum systems ? \" on a website  @xcite .",
    "this question highlights a dilemma that we all face : on the one hand , ssb can only happen for nonlinear systems ; on the other hand , quantum systems are always linear .",
    "the connection between ssb and effective ground state that we have shown here may provide a fresh perspective into this issue : nonlinearity needed for ssb is rooted in the degeneracy ( or quasi - degeneracy ) of quantum energy levels .",
    "as our system is an interacting boson system , we use the penrose - onsager criterion @xcite to further analyze its quantum ground state . in lattice models ,",
    "the condensed fraction is given by the eigenvalues of reduced single particle density matrix @xmath50 . here for the double - well potential , we have @xmath51\\,.\\ ] ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ fraction](a ) , for strong pair tunneling , both of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are nonzero .",
    "so , the system is in fact a fragmented condensate .    .",
    "( b ) order parameter @xmath52 ( blue solid line ) and pair order parameter @xmath53 ( red dashed line ) as a function of pair tunneling strength for the quantum ground state .",
    "they are rescaled with respect to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "@xmath40.,width=340 ]    the fragmentation of the quantum ground state corresponds to the degeneracy of mean field ground state .",
    "this is a general relation that is also present in other fragmented systems .",
    "for example , in the antiferromagnetic ground state of spin-1 bose gases @xcite , the quantum ground state is unique while its effective ground state has infinite degeneracy due to the intrinsic su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "thus the quantum ground state also corresponds to a fragmented condensate .",
    "fragmented condensate is usually unstable against perturbations and will evolve into one simple condensate , which is one of the effective ground state .",
    "distinct to the bose - hubbard model previously studied , one can define two kinds of order parameters for the quantum ground state in this model .",
    "one is the ordinary single particle order parameter @xmath52 , and the other is the pair order parameter @xmath53 .",
    "both order parameters change with pair tunneling strength ( fig .",
    "[ fraction](b ) ) .",
    "one immediately sees that in the strong pair tunneling limit , the single particle order parameter @xmath52 almost vanishes , while the pair order parameter @xmath53 approaches a saturation value @xmath56 .",
    "this behavior indicates that for strong pair tunneling the condensate is no longer the usual single particle condensate , but a _",
    "pair condensate_. the pair order parameter changes sign during the increase of pair tunneling strength as a result of minimization of the pair tunneling energy . by tuning the ratio of pair tunneling to single particle tunneling ,",
    "the system experiences a quantum phase transition from the single particle condensate to the pair condensate .",
    "the pair condensate defined in this way can be extended into the case of optical lattice with periodic boundary condition , where a _ pair superfluid _ can be defined similarly . in this lattice system ,",
    "the quantum ground state is still unique while the mean field one becomes hugely degenerate due to the large quasi - degeneracy in the quantum energy levels . from the analysis of the double - well model , it is clear that this pair superfluid is unstable and",
    "may decay into one of the mean field ground states , which is a simple superfluid .",
    "among all the mean field ground states , two of them are of special interest . denote the phase difference between two neighboring wells as @xmath57 , and then there are states with consecutive @xmath58 or @xmath59 phase accumulation between neighboring wells , satisfying @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the number of wells , and @xmath62 is the winding number of order parameter ) .",
    "they correspond to superfluids flowing clockwisely or counter - clockwisely .",
    "thus these two ground states carry nonzero mass current , which is unconventional .",
    "note that the meaning of the pair superfluid here is different from that defined in bcs pairing or boson dimer for attractive interaction @xcite .",
    "obviously no bound state or dimer is formed here .",
    "similar order parameter also exists elsewhere @xcite , where a _ trion superfluid _ is defined .",
    "changes with temperature ( in arbitrary unit ) and pair tunneling strength @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath40.,width=340 ]     changes with temperature ( in arbitrary unit ) and pair tunneling strength @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath40.,width=340 ]    with all the information of eigenvalues and eigenstates , one can also obtain the exact phase diagram of the double - well model at finite temperature , as shown in figs .",
    "[ 1op ] and [ 2op ] . at zero temperature",
    ", one can see the signature of quantum phase transition , though here due to finite size effect , the transition becomes a crossover and the critical point also shifts .",
    "the pair condensate can also exist at finite temperature , but is killed along with the single particle condensate at high temperature .",
    "in summary , we have investigated both the quantum and mean field ground states of the extended bose - hubbard model for a double - well potential with pair tunneling .",
    "firstly , we find that when the pair tunneling is strong enough , the mean field ground state of the system becomes complex and two - fold degenerate , while the quantum counterpart is always real and unique .",
    "the quantum ground state can be regarded as a superposition of two mean field states .",
    "secondly , we have also discussed spontaneous symmetry breaking in the perspective of effective ground state .",
    "the model serves as an example where the true ground state ( quantum ground state ) is quite different from the effective ground state ( mean field ground state ) that we really observe in experiments .",
    "we show that the degeneracy of the effective ground state is closely related to spontaneous symmetry breaking , the quasi - degeneracy of the quantum spectrum and the stability of the quantum ground state . for large particle number",
    ", the quantum ground state is very sensitive to infinitesimal perturbations breaking the time reversal symmetry , resulting in one symmetry breaking effective ground state .",
    "finally , we find that in the strong pair tunneling limit , the quantum ground state in fact corresponds to a fragmented condensate . in terms of the defined pair order parameter ,",
    "it is also a pair condensate .",
    "we then provide a complete phase diagram of this model at finite temperature , and predict the instability of the pair superfluid in an optical lattice .",
    "although for usual systems , the pair tunneling is much weaker than the single particle tunneling , their ratio can be tuned experimentally with the method of shaking the optical lattice @xcite .",
    "so the conclusion drawn here can be tested within the current experimental techniques .",
