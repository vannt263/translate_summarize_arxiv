    "the formation of topological defects in phase transition is a very generic phenomenon in physics .",
    "it can be studied experimentally in different condensed matter systems .",
    "it is generally believed that the early evolution of universe undergoes a sequence of phase transitions , and the produced topological defects in these phase transitions may have observable consequences to the properties of the universe today .",
    "for example , the cosmic strings have been suggested as one possible source for the primordial density perturbations that give rise to the large - scale structure of the universe and the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation@xcite@xcite . in particular , in ref.@xcite the effect of the pion string on the primordial magnetic field generation in the early universe has been considered and its cosmological significance is pointed out .",
    "however , in this paper , we will turn from cosmology to laboratory experiments and attempt to study the possible signals of the pion string in the heavy ion collision experiments which have many similarities with the nonequilibrium phenomena that also take place in heavy ion collisions experiments@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is difficult to make experimental tests of our ideas about the formation and evolution of topological defects in cosmology directly .",
    "what we can do is to look for analogous processes in experimentally accessible condensed - matter systems .",
    "fortunately , topological defects are formed at phase transitions in certain condensed matter systems such as super - fluids and superconductors , this phenomenon is theoretically very similar to its cosmological counterpart , and we can use this analogy to do `` cosmology experiments''@xcite . on a more fundamental level , these same experiments can be used to test our understanding of non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories@xcite .    in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , some phenomena which like that happens in the big bang have been observed , this is called the little bang .",
    "thus as hadron momentum spectra correlations provide strong evidence for the existence of the little bang : thermal hadron radiation with t=90 - 100mev and strong 3-dimensional ( hubble like ) expansion with transverse flow velocities 0.5 - 0.55c @xcite .",
    "so the study of little bang from relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions may construct a bridge between high energy particle physics and the cosmology . on the other hand ,",
    "we are not yet in a position to give an evidence that quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) has really been produced .",
    "it turns out to be a difficult task to figure out the theoretical picture of qgp even in equilibrium . beyond the trivial level of the trees and the non - equilibrium properties of the qgp",
    "are essentially unknown .",
    "there is no unique signal of qgp in the understanding of nucleus - nucleus collisions so far . as pointed out by rajantie @xcite , since the heavy - ion collisions experiments are so complicated that the reliable and accurate theoretical calculations are needed in order to confront the experimental results , but our present understanding of the theory is too rudimentary for that .",
    "then the insight provided by condensed systems experiments is therefore likely to be extremely useful . in particular , it is believed that at a certain value of the beam energy , the qgp which is produced in the collision cools through a second - order transition point .",
    "pion strings as well as other topological and non - topological strings are expected to be produced@xcite@xcite .",
    "an early study on the effects of these strings in the case of heavy ion collisions and in the early universe has been performed in ref.@xcite , in their paper , they speculate that formation and subsequent evolution of the network of these string defects can give rise to inhomogeneous distribution of baryons and also the energy density by using the kibble mechanism . in this paper , we extend their works on the formation and evolution of strings and discuss the possible signal of pion strings during chiral phase transition in the high ion collisions .",
    "so far the theoretical scenario what can be applied to study the formation of topological defects in systems with global symmetry is the kibble - zurek mechanism@xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover , according to pisarski and wilczek @xcite the chiral phase transition is expected to be of the second order for two massless flavors , it is customary then in this paper to apply the kibble - zurek mechanism in order to study the formation and evolution of the pion string during pb - pb central collisions at the lhc with energy @xmath1 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give a brief review of the pion string in the linear sigma model in sec.ii .",
    "it is shown how to use the kibble - zurek mechanism to consider the formation of the pion string at lhc in sec.iii .",
    "we discuss the evolution and decay of the pion string and their possible observational consequences at lhc in sec .",
    "v is reserved for summary and discussion .",
    "the linear sigma model which serves as a good low energy effective theory of the qcd was first introduced in the 1960s as a model for pion - nucleon interactions@xcite and has attracted much attention recently , especially in studies involving disoriented chiral condensates@xcite@xcite .",
    "this model is very well suited to describing the physics of pions in studies of chiral symmetry . in",
    "what follows we will review the work of @xcite in which it was shown that below the chiral symmetry breaking scale , the linear sigma model admits global vortex line solutions , the pion string .",
    "we then attempt to use the kibble - zurek mechanism to give out a quantitative description of the formation and evolution of the pion string and their possible observational consequences in heavy ion collisions .    considering a simple case of qcd with two massless quarks @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the lagrangian of strong interaction is invariant under @xmath4 chiral transformation @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "however this chiral symmetry does not appear in the low energy particle spectrum since it is spontaneously broken to the diagonal subgroup formation .",
    "consequently , three goldstone bosons , the pions , appear and the ( constituent ) quarks become massive . at low energy ,",
    "the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry can be described by an effective theory , the linear sigma model , which involves the massless pions @xmath7 and a massive @xmath8 particle . as usual , we introduce the field @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unity matrix and @xmath11 is the pauli matrices with the normalization condition @xmath12 . under @xmath4 chiral transformations ,",
    "@xmath13 transforms as @xmath14    the renormalizable effective lagrangian of the linear sigma model can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16-\\lambda [ \\textrm{tr}(\\phi ^{+}\\phi ) -\\frac{f_\\pi^2 } { 2}]^2\\ ] ] and @xmath17 during chiral symmetry breaking , the @xmath18 field takes on a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value , which breaks @xmath4  down to @xmath19 .",
    "it results in a massive sigma particle @xmath8 and three massless goldstone bosons @xmath7 , as well as giving a mass @xmath20 to the constituent quarks field can be used to represent the quark condensate and the order parameter for the chiral phase transition since both exhibit the same behavior under chiral transformations@xcite , the pions are very light particles and can be considered approximately as massless goldstone bosons . ] .    in the previous paper , two of us ( x.z . and t.h . ) with brandenberger@xcite discovered a type of classical solution , the pion string , in the above linear sigma model .",
    "this pion string is very much like the spin vortex produced at the superfluid transition of the liquid @xmath21@xcite .",
    "similarly to the z string @xcite@xcite in the standard electroweak model , the pion string is not topologically stable , since any field configuration can be continuously deformed to the trivial vacuum in the qcd sigma model . with finite temperature plasma ,",
    "however one of us ( nagasawa ) and brandenberger@xcite argued that the pion string can be stabilized .",
    "they propose that the interaction of the pion fields with the charged plasma generates a correction to the effective potential and this correction reduces the vacuum maniford @xmath22 of the zero temperature theory to a lower dimensional sub - maniford @xmath23 , which makes the pion string stable .",
    "moreover , it has been shown by numerical simulations that semilocal strings , which are also not topologically stable , can be produced at the phase transition@xcite@xcite . in a similar way",
    ", pion strings are expected to be produced during the qcd phase transition in the early universe as well as in experiment of the heavy ion collisions .. the strings will subsequently decay .    the pion string is a static configuration of the lagrangian @xmath24 of eq.([eq1 ] ) . in order to discuss the pion string ,",
    "we define new fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 the lagrangian @xmath27 now can be rewritten as @xmath28 for the static configuration , the energy functional corresponding to the above lagrangian is given by @xmath29.\\ ] ] the time - independent equations of motion are : @xmath30 and @xmath31 the pion string solution with a single winding number extremizing the energy functional in eq.([eq3 ] ) is given by@xcite @xmath32\\exp ( i\\theta ) \\ ] ] and @xmath33 here the coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 are polar coordinates in @xmath36 plane ( the string is assumed to lie along the @xmath37 axis ) , @xmath38 , the energy per unit length of the string is @xmath39\\pi f_\\pi ^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is introduced as a cutoff since for global symmetry the energy density of the string solution is logarithmically divergent .",
    "generally @xmath40 is given by the horizon size or the typical separation length between strings .",
    "the typical distance between strings can be determined by the string number density at the formation which is based on the the kibble - zurek mechanism and the following evolution which is ruled out by the string tension and the interaction between the string and the surrounding matter .",
    "thus the interaction between the strings would not be so significant . in the following numerical calculation",
    ", we take @xmath41 , for other parameters we have @xmath42 , @xmath43mev , @xmath44mev and @xmath45mev@xcite .",
    "the order of the qcd chiral phase transition seems to depend on the mass of the non - strange @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks , @xmath46 , and the mass of the strange quark @xmath47 . at the phase transition temperature on the order of @xmath48mev , heavier quark flavors",
    "do not play an essential role . in the chiral limit , one can use universality arguments to determine the order of the phase transition . according to universality , the order of the chiral transition in qcd is identical to that in a theory with the same chiral symmetries as qcd , for instance , the @xmath49 linear sigma model for @xmath50 massless quark flavors .",
    "this argument was employed by pisarski and wilczek@xcite who showed that for @xmath51 flavors of massless quarks , the transition can be of second order , if the @xmath52 symmetry is explicitly broken by instantons , while for three or more massless flavors , the phase transition for the restoration of the @xmath53 is first order .",
    "so far , the formation of topological defects has been studied in liquid crystal and superfluid experiments@xcite , which are systems with global symmetry .",
    "it is generally believed that the theoretical scenario that can be applied to determine the defects initially formed immediately after second - order symmetry breaking phase transition in this case is the kibble - zurek mechanism .",
    "the basic picture of this mechanism is the following . for a second phase transition , after the phase transition",
    ", the physical space develops a domain like structure , with the typical size of the domain being of the order of a relevant correlation length @xmath54 ( which depends on the nature of the dynamics of the phase transition ) . inside a given domain ,",
    "the broken phase is roughly uniform , but varies randomly from one domain to the other .",
    "the string defects are to be formed in the junction of three or more domains .",
    "it is customary then for us to apply the kibble - zurek mechanism to make an estimate of the density of pion strings during pb - pb central collisions at the lhc with energy @xmath1 . at the initial stage of the collision there exists manifestly partons with very large cross section for gluon scattering , so the gluons will reach equilibrium quickly with an initial temperature at about @xmath55mev corresponding to the time @xmath56fm@xcite . if the entropy of the system is conserved throughout the expansion , using the bjorken model we have that the thermal freeze out of the fireball occurs at @xmath57fm when the temperature reaches @xmath58mev .",
    "the calculation in ref.@xcite shows that the quark - gluon plasma can be formed over very large space - time volumes at the lhc pb - pb collisions .",
    "the hydrodynamic model predicts that the volume of such a plasma region evolves as@xcite@xcite@xcite , @xmath59 where @xmath60@xmath61 , while evolution of the temperature is given by @xmath62 from eqs.([volume ] ) and ( [ temperature ] ) we obtain that the time when the phase transition occurs at @xmath63mev is @xmath64fm , and the volume at the freezing out is @xmath65@xmath61 .    when the lhc pb - pb collisions take place , a big fireball is formed in the central region of the collision with the initial temperature around @xmath66mev at the time @xmath56fm .",
    "the fireball quickly reaches to the equilibrium state and it expands rapidly with the volume and temperature given in eqs.([volume ] ) and ( [ temperature ] ) . during the period when the temperature is higher than @xmath63mev ( before @xmath67fm ) , the fireball is in the qgp phase where the chiral symmetry is unbroken .",
    "when the temperature of the fireball decreases down to the critical point @xmath68mev and its volume is about @xmath69@xmath61 , the fireball undergoes a rapid second order chiral phase transition . at this time the system is in an out of equilibrium dynamical state , and the phase with broken chiral symmetry starts to appear due to the fluctuations of the order parameter simultaneously and independently in many separate regions of the expanding fireball . subsequently during the process with further cooling , these regions grow and merge with each other to realize the new phase with the broken symmetry all over the fireball . at the boundaries where causally disconnected different regions meet ,",
    "the order parameter field does not necessarily match and a domain structure is formed .",
    "this is essentially similar to the process of the defect formation during the cosmological phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "as described by the kibble - zurek mechanism , the transition speed can be given by the quench time @xmath70 @xcite@xcite@xcite , @xmath71 from the ginzburg - landau theory for the second order phase transition , the quench time @xmath72 can be deduced by the order parameter relaxation time @xmath73 with a general form @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the zero temperature limiting value of the temperature dependent coherence length @xmath77 , which in this paper we take @xmath78fm .",
    "when the temperature @xmath79 is close to @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 as the temperature is below @xmath80 the order parameter coherence spreads out with the velocity @xmath82 the pion strings are expected to be produced at the zurek freeze - out time @xmath83 when the causally disconnected regions have grown together and the coherence is established in the whole volume . at the zurek freeze - out temperature @xmath84",
    ", the causal horizon is given by @xmath85 the causal horizon has to be equal to the coherence length @xmath86 , then from eqs.([tau])([xi])([xih ] ) we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath88 due to the kibble - zurek mechanism , a network of pion strings is formed at the zurek freeze - out time @xmath83 with a typical curvature radius and separation of @xmath89 .",
    "after that time , the network of the pion string is going to evolve with the fireball expansions until to the freeze - out time @xmath90 .",
    "similarly to the evolution of the cosmic string in the early universe@xcite@xcite@xcite , when the temperature of the fireball falls down from the zurek temperature , @xmath91mev to @xmath92 , the evolution of the string network would obey the following procedure .",
    "initially , at the zurek time @xmath83 , the pion string has a typical curvature radius and separation of the correlation length @xmath89 , which then increases rapidly and eventually approaches a scaling solution in which @xmath93 . in the case of the pion string in the heavy ion collision experiments ,",
    "since the volume of fire ball obeys the following law @xmath94 , we make the assumption that @xmath95 for our case from time @xmath83 up to @xmath90 .",
    "hence , the correlation length of the pion string at time @xmath90 is @xmath96 the pion string ceases to evolve at the time @xmath90 and decays because of the fireball disappearance .",
    "hence we have to find out the size and number of loops at the time @xmath90 .",
    "note that in our situation , closed string loops have a dominant contribution to the total energy of the string .",
    "this is because at the freezing out , the string evolution is still ruled out by the frictional force by the surrounding matter so that the free motion of the string is not realized .",
    "in addition , the expansion of the system is too rapid that the initial brownian string distribution will be conserved .",
    "then the initial structure of the string network partially remain and the spatial trajectories of strings are very much complicated . thus we take the initial pion string network as that of the brownian one and regard that the distribution of these loops does not change with time , the size of the loops are conformally stretched during the expansion of fireball and a simple scaling can be realized . by using the scale invariance of brownian string described by vachaspati and vilenkin@xcite",
    ", we get the distribution of number density of the pion string with the length between @xmath97 and @xmath98 at the freeze out temperature , @xmath92 , @xmath99 where the parameter @xmath100 is approximately in the range of @xmath101@xcite .",
    "integration of eq.(21 ) over @xmath102 will result in the total number of the string loops .",
    "note that the string width @xmath103 gives a minimum length of the pion string at time @xmath90 , @xmath104fm and the longest string is also constrained by the volume of the system . from eq.([eq01 ] ) we have the total number of pion strings @xmath105 since @xmath100 varies from 0.01 to 0.1 the total number of pion strings varies between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    in the immediate aftermath of the phase transition , when the temperature is still close to @xmath80 ,",
    "the string tension remains small and motion of the strings is heavily damped by the frictional effects of the surrounding high - density medium .",
    "the mechanism of nagasawa and brandenberger implies that pion strings might effectively be stable in this high - density medium until the thermal freeze out time @xmath90 .",
    "after that , the string tension approaches its zero - temperature value and the motion of the strings is effectively decoupled from the surrounding medium , there will not be corrections to the effective potential from the thermal bath and pion strings undergo the second phase transition .",
    "even though pion strings undergo the second phase transition under the temperature @xmath92 , pion strings will not decay immediately and can still survive sometime below the freeze out time @xmath90 , since the pion strings undergo a core phase transition and lose their central structure where the field strength equals to zero but still preserve the winding number of neutral components@xcite . for simplicity",
    "we assume that pion strings can survive after the decoupling time and all pions which are eventually emitted from pion strings will be completely incoherent with the rest of pions.according to the work of ref.@xcite , the produced pions in the interval @xmath108 have time to be thermalized before the freeze out time , they lead to an enhancement of thermal pions , while in the interval @xmath109 the produced pions do not get chance to be thermalized , they result in a nonthermal enhancement of pions with low momentum .",
    "thus it is expected that the resultant pion spectrum with the pion string will contain the nonthermal pions which can be taken as the evidence of the pion string .",
    "all pion strings will decay into the sigma particles and neutral pions . to estimate the numbers of the particle produced we",
    "notice that for the ansatz eqs.([eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , the sigma field in eq.([eq3 ] ) contributes about @xmath110 of the total energy of the string .",
    "due to energy conservation half of the string energy should convert into that carried by the sigma particles .",
    "the remaining @xmath110 of the string energy will go to the neutral pions .",
    "for global string such as the axion string @xcite one expects the mesons produced from the decay of the pion strings with length @xmath97 have a typical momentum @xmath111 . using eq.([eq01 ] )",
    ", we obtain that the total number of sigma particle @xmath112 emitted from pion strings within a fireball is about @xmath113(k=0.1 ) , @xmath114(k=0.05 ) , @xmath115(k=0.03 ) and @xmath116(k=0.01 ) , respectively . and the total number of neutral pions @xmath117 is about @xmath118(k=0.1 ) , @xmath119(k=0.05 ) , @xmath120(k=0.03 ) and @xmath121(k=0.01 ) . as mentioned above it",
    "is expected that the eventually resultant pion spectrum will have a nonthermal enhancement at low momentum region because all produced pions from pion strings are distributed at low momentum .",
    "it can be seen that the most of the sigma particles and the neutral pions have a relatively low momentum and these particles are nonthermal particles .",
    "the momentum distribution of the sigma from the pion string decay is given by @xmath122 where the normalization factor @xmath123 .",
    "the momentum distribution of the neutral pions is given by @xmath124 where the normalization factor @xmath125 .",
    "the averaged momentum of sigma and neutral pion is @xmath126mev .",
    "the neutral pions and sigma particles are dominant in the low momentum region , and the momentum distribution of the pions produced at the decay of the pion string can be taken as a distinctive signal of the formation of the pion string in heavy ion collisions .",
    "s , @xmath127 ) via @xmath18 decay from the pion strings are mostly distributed around @xmath128 . ]",
    "the sigma particles from pion strings will decay equally into neutral and charged pion mesons .",
    "as we know , the @xmath18 particle has a large decay width and it is more complicated issue to get the real distribution of the pions from the @xmath18 meson . in order to get the simplified results , we ignore its large decay width and take it as a stable particle .",
    "since the momentum of the sigma can be approximately neglected , for @xmath129mev these pions from the sigma decay will have momentum around @xmath130mev . in fig.[fig1 ] we plot the distribution of these pions as a function of the momentum together with the thermal pions calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "numerically there are about @xmath131 nonthermal pions mostly distributed at @xmath132mev for @xmath133(in the following discussion , for simplicity , we always take the parameter @xmath133 for the case of the sigma decay . ) .     and",

    "in fact , the @xmath18 particle is a broad resonance and have a decay width , then the narrow peak in fig.[fig1 ] will definitely smoothen out . in order to get a more reality figures , we should take into account the decay width of sigma and redraw the figure .",

    "the nonthermal pions are mainly distributed around @xmath144 . ]",
    "since the string configuration violates the isospin symmetry the direct production of the pions from the pion string decay is only for the neutral pion , not the charged pion . in fig.[fig3 ] we plot these neutral pion distribution together with the thermal pions .",

    "we have investigated the effects of the pion string in the experiment of the heavy ion collisions . following the kibble - zurek mechanism pion strings",
    "are expected to be formed in lhc pb - pb collision at energy @xmath147 tev , then decay after the freezing out time into pions .",

    "the pion enhancement in a small window around the nonthermal momentum @xmath148mev for neutral pions .",
    "while for other nonthermal pions , the situation is completely different .",
    "if we ignore the large decay width of the sigma and take the sigma as a stable particle , there are the pion enhancement in a small window around the nonthermal momentum @xmath149mev , but actually the sigma has the large decay width , then the peak will smoothen out and almost tend to disappear .",
    "so it is difficult to detect this part of nonthermal pions in experiment .",
    "all the resultant pion spectrum depend strongly on how long the pion string can survive below the freeze out time @xmath90 .    in this paper",
    ", we have made the assumption that pion strings can survive after the decoupling time , then both the neutral pions and sigma particles emitted from pion strings do not get chance to be thermalized . on the other hand",
    ", we do not exclude the situation in which part ( even all ) of pion strings will decay into pions and sigma particles when the time is very close to the decoupling time , and such produced pions from pion strings will be thermalized by the final state interactions and the peak in the pion spectra due to the pion string decay will disappear partly ( or completely ) .",
    "however , even though this situation is happened , there still have possible signals of the pion string produced .",
    "then pion string decay can lead to experimentally observable anomlies which are very similar to the dcc(disoriented chiral condensate ) decay .",
    "it is the ratio of neutral to charged pions , @xmath150 , here @xmath151 is the number of neutral pions while @xmath152 is corresponding to charged pions , which is different from what is naively expected ( @xmath153 ) if there are pion strings produced during chiral phase transition .",
    "also enhancement of sigma which in turn decay into pions around the decoupling time will also result in nonthermal pions , though thses nonthermal pions is difficult to be detected because of the large decay width of the sigma .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain more reliable conclusions , we need to know more detail of the process of the pion string decay , the sigma decay and behaviors of the fire - ball at freeze out time in heavy ion collisions .",
