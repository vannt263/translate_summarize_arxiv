    "einstein s 1915 relativistic theory of gravity  general relativity  will soon be a century old .",
    "it is the classical theory of one of the four fundamental forces .",
    "it underlies our contemporary understanding of the big bang , black holes , pulsars , quasars , x - ray sources , the final destiny of stars , gravitational waves , and the evolution of the universe itself .",
    "it is the intellectual origin of many of the ideas at play in the quest for a unified theory of the fundamental forces that includes gravity .",
    "the heart of general relativity is one of the most beautiful and revolutionary ideas in modern science  the idea that gravity _ is _ the geometry of curved four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "general relativity and quantum mechanics are usually regarded as the two greatest developments of twentieth - century physics .    yet , paradoxically , general relativity  so well established , so important for several branches of physics , and so simple in its basic conception  is often not represented anywhere in the undergraduate physics curriculum .",
    "an informal survey by william hiscock @xcite of the course offerings of 32 mid - western research universities found only a handful that offered an intermediate ( junior / senior ) course in general relativity as part of the undergraduate physics curriculum .",
    "this has the consequence that many students see gravity first in the context of planetary orbits in basic mechanics and next , if at all , in an advanced graduate course designed in part for prospective specialists in the subject .",
    "there might have been an argument for such an organization half a century ago .",
    "but there is none today in an era when gravitational physics is increasingly important , increasingly topical , increasingly integrated with other areas of physics , and increasingly connected with experiment and observation . in the author s opinion",
    ", every undergraduate physics major should have an opportunity to be introduced to general relativity .",
    "its importance in contemporary physics is not the only reason for introducing undergraduates to general relativity .",
    "there are others : first , the subject excites interest in students .",
    "warped spacetime , black holes , and the big bang are the focus both of contemporary research and of popular scientific fascination .",
    "students specializing in physics naturally want to know more .",
    "a further argument for undergraduate general relativity is accessibility .",
    "as i hope to show in this paper , a number of important phenomena of gravitational physics can be efficiently introduced with just a basic background in mechanics and a minimum of mathematics beyond the usual advanced calculus tool kit .",
    "other subjects of great contemporary importance such as high temperature superconductivity or gauge theories of the strong interactions require much more prerequisite information .",
    "general relativity can be made accessible to both students and faculty alike at the undergraduate level .",
    "it is probably fruitless to speculate on why a subject as basic , accessible , and important as general relativity is not taught more widely as part of the undergraduate physics curriculum .",
    "limited time , limited resources , inertia , tradition , and misconceptions may all play a role .",
    "certainly it is not a lack of textbooks",
    "@xcite@xcite are a partial list of texts known to the author that treat general relativity in some way at an introductory level .",
    "available time is one of the obstacles to introducing general relativity at the undergraduate level .",
    "the deductive approach to teaching this subject ( as for most others ) is to assemble the necessary mathematical tools , motivate the field equations , solve the equations in interesting circumstances , and compare the predictions with observation and experiment .",
    "this ` math first ' order takes time to develop for general relativity which may not be available to either students or faculty .",
    "this article describes a different , ` physics first ' approach to introducing general relativity at the junior / senior level .",
    "briefly , the simplest physically relevant solutions to the einstein equation are introduced _ first _ , without derivation , as curved spacetimes whose properties and observable consequences can be explored by a study of the motion of test particles and light rays .",
    "this brings the student to interesting physical phenomena as quickly as possible .",
    "it is the part of the subject most directly connected to classical mechanics and the part that requires a minimum of ` new ' mathematical ideas . later",
    "the einstein equation can be motivated and solved to show where the solutions come from . when time is limited",
    "this is a surer and more direct route to getting at the applications of general relativity that are important in contemporary science .",
    "section ii expands very briefly on the importance of general relativity in contemporary physics .",
    "section iii outlines the basic structure of the subject .",
    "sections iv and v describe the ` math first ' and ` physics first ' approaches to introducing general relativity to undergraduate physics majors .",
    "this is not an even - handed comparison .",
    "the ` math first ' approach is described only to contrast it with the ` physics first ' approach which is advocated in this paper .",
    "section vi illustrates how ideas from classical mechanics can be used to calculate important effects in general relativity .",
    "section vii reports the personal experiences of the author in using the ` physics first ' method .",
    "gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces at accessible energy scales .",
    "the ratio of the gravitational force to the electric force between two protons separated by a distance @xmath0 is ( in gaussian electromagnetic units ) @xmath1 gravity might thus seem to be negligible . but",
    "three other facts explain why it is important and where it is important .",
    "first , gravity is a universal force coupling to all forms of mass and energy .",
    "second , gravity is a long - range force in contrast to the weak and strong forces which are characterized by nucleus - size ranges and below .",
    "third , and most importantly , gravity is unscreened .",
    "there is no negative `` gravitational charge '' ; mass is always positive .",
    "these three facts explain why gravity is the dominant force governing the structure of the universe on the largest scales of space and time  the scales of astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the strong and weak forces are short range .",
    "the relatively much greater strength of electromagnetic forces ensures that charges will be screened in an electrically neutral universe like ours .",
    "only gravity is left to operate on very large scales .",
    "relativistic gravity  general relativity  is important for an object of mass @xmath2 and size @xmath3 when @xmath4 neutron stars @xmath5 and black holes @xmath6 are relativistic objects by this rough criterion .",
    "so is our universe @xmath7 if we take @xmath3 to be the present hubble distance and @xmath2 to be the mass within it .",
    "figure 1 displays some phenomena for which relativity is important and ones for which it is not .",
    "= 3.3 in    general relativity can sometimes be important even when @xmath8 is small provided compensating observational precision can be achieved . for the sun @xmath9 , yet the solar system",
    "is the domain of the precision tests that confirm general relativity to as much as 1 part in @xmath10 @xcite . for the earth @xmath11 ,",
    "yet general relativistic effects are important for the operation of the global positioning system ( gps ) @xcite .",
    "relativistic gravity is also important on the smallest scales considered in contemporary physics  those of quantum gravity .",
    "these are characterized by the planck length @xmath12 @xmath13 this is much , much smaller than even the scale of the strong interactions @xmath14 cm . yet",
    ", this is the scale which many contemporary explorers believe will naturally characterize the final theory unifying the four fundamental forces including gravity .",
    "this is the characteristic scale of string theory .",
    "this is the scale that will characterize the union of the two great developments of twentieth century physics  general relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the important point for this discussion is that the last few decades have seen dramatic growth in observational data on the frontier of the very large , and an equally dramatic growth in theoretical confidence in exploring the frontier of the very small .",
    "black holes , for example , are no longer a theorist s dream .",
    "they have been identified at the center of galaxies ( including our own ) and in x - ray binaries .",
    "they are central to the explanations of the most energetic phenomena in the universe such as active galactic nuclei . on even larger scales , it is now a commonplace observation that cosmology has become a data driven science .",
    "cosmological parameters once uncertain by orders of magnitude have been determined to accuracies of 10% @xcite .",
    "adventures into planck scale physics may be mostly in the minds of theorists , but the quest for a unified theory of the fundamental forces including gravity is being pursued with impressive vigor and confidence by a large community .",
    "indeed , at the big bang where large and small are one , we should eventually see direct evidence of planck scale physics .    for these reasons",
    "general relativity is increasingly central to today s physics .",
    "it is increasingly topical , increasingly connected with experiment and observation , and increasingly integrated with other branches of physics",
    "this section sketches a few key ideas in general relativity for those who may not be familiar with the theory .",
    "the intent is not to offer an exposition of these ideas . that , after all , is properly the task of texts on the subject .",
    "rather , the purpose is merely to mention ideas that will occur in the subsequent discussion and to illustrate the simplicity of the conceptual structure of the subject .",
    "it s potentially misleading to summarize any subject in physics in terms of slogans . however , the following three roughly stated ideas are central to general relativity .    *",
    "_ gravity is geometry .",
    "_ phenomena familiarly seen as arising from gravitational forces in a newtonian context are more generally due to the curvature of geometry of four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "* _ mass - energy is the source of spacetime curvature .",
    "_ mass is the source of spacetime curvature and , since general relativity incorporates special relativity , any form of energy is also a source of spacetime curvature . *",
    "_ free mass moves on straight paths in curved spacetime .",
    "_ in general relativity , the earth moves around the sun in the orbit it does , not because of a gravitational force exerted by the sun , but because it is following a straight path in the curved spacetime produced by the sun .    making these ideas more precise and more explicit",
    "is an objective of any course in general relativity .",
    "we mention a few steps toward this objective here .",
    "points in four - dimensional spacetime can be located by four coordinates @xmath15 .",
    "coordinates are arbitrary provided they label points uniquely . generally , several different coordinate patches are required to label all the points in spacetime .    the geometry of a spacetime is specified by giving the _ metric _ , @xmath16 , where the @xmath17 indicates that the metric is generally a function of all four coordinates .",
    "the metric determines the squared distance @xmath18 in four - dimensional spacetime between points separated by infinitesimal coordinate intervals @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , @xmath20 where a double sum over @xmath21 and @xmath22 from 0 to 3 is implied .",
    "integration of the @xmath23 specfied by this expression gives the distance along curves .",
    "metrics satisfy the _",
    "einstein equation _",
    "@xmath24 relating a measure of curvature on the left hand side to the energy - momentum tensor of matter on the right .",
    "this einstein equation comprises 10 non - linear , partial differential equations for the metric @xmath25 .",
    "an important example of a solution to the einstein equation is the schwarzschild geometry giving the metric in the empty space outside a spherically symmetric black hole or star . in standard",
    "schwarzschild spherical coordinates @xmath26 this is @xmath27 where @xmath2 is the mass of the black hole or star .",
    "this , to an excellent approximation , describes the curved spacetime outside our sun .",
    "test particles with masses too small to affect the ambient geometry move on straight paths in it .",
    "more precisely , they move between any two points , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in spacetime on a world line ( curve ) of stationary proper time @xmath30 . the proper time along a world line is the distance along it measured in time units .",
    "thus , @xmath31 .",
    "( the negative sign is so @xmath32 is positive along the world lines of particles which always move with less than the speed of light ) .",
    "curves of stationary proper time are called _",
    "geodesics_. the world line of a particle through spacetime from @xmath28 to @xmath29 can be described by giving its coordinates @xmath33 as a function of any parameter that takes fixed values on the end points .",
    "for instance using the schwarzschild metric , the principle of stationary proper time takes the form : @xmath34^{\\frac{1}{2}}=0 \\label{threefive}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 means the first variation as in classical mechanics .",
    "the variational principle for stationary proper time has the same form as the variational principle for stationary action in classical mechanics .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath37 is the integrand of .",
    "lagrange s equations are the geodesic equations of motion .",
    "their form can be made especially simple by choosing proper time @xmath30 for the parameter @xmath35 . from them",
    "one can deduce the conservation of energy , the conservation of angular momentum , and an effective equation for radial motion in the schwarzschild geometry as we will describe in section vi [ cf . ] . with that , one can calculate a spectrum of phenomena ranging from the precession of planetary orbits to the collapse to a black hole .",
    "when extended to light rays and implemented in appropriate metrics , the geodesic equations are enough to explore most of the important applications of relativistic gravity displayed in table 1 .",

    "the deductive approach to teaching many subjects in physics is to    1 .   introduce the necessary mathematical tools ; 2 .   motivate and explain the basic field equations ; 3 .",

    "this deductive order of presentation is logical ; it is the order used by the great classic texts @xcite ; and it is the order used in standard graduate courses introducing the subject at an advanced level .",
    "but the deductive order does have some drawbacks for an elementary introduction to physics majors in a limited time .",
    "differential geometry is a deep and beautiful mathematical subject .",
    "however , even an elementary introduction to its basic ideas and methods are not a part of the typical advanced calculus tool kit acquired by physics majors in their first few years .",
    "this is ` new math ' .",
    "in contrast , the vector calculus central to electromagnetism _ is _ part of this tool kit .",
    "it is possible at the undergraduate level to give an introduction to the basic mathematical ideas of manifolds , vectors , dual vectors , tensors , metric , covariant derivative , and curvature . indeed , many students feel empowered by learning new mathematics .",
    "but it does take time .",
    "it also must be practiced .",
    "the author s experience is that many students at this level need considerable exercise before they are able to accurately and efficiently manipulate tensorial expressions and feel at home with the four - dimensional mathematical concepts necessary to formulate einstein s equation .",
    "when time is limited , pursuing the deductive order may leave little available for the interesting applications of general relativity .",
    "further , solving the einstein equation to exhibit physically relevant spacetime geometries is a difficult matter .",
    "their non - linear nature means that there is no known general solution outside of linearized gravity .",
    "each new situation , _",
    "e.g. _ spherical symmetry , homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models , gravitational plane waves , is typically a new problem in applied mathematics . deriving the solutions only adds to the time expended before interesting applications can be discussed .",
    "many of the successful introductory texts in general relativity follow this logical order at various levels of compromise . in the author",
    "s opinion , an outstanding example is bernard schutz s classic _ a first course in general relativity _",
    "@xcite . in the next section",
    "we consider a different way of introducing general relativity to undergraduates .",
    "electricity and magnetism are not usually presented in introductory ( freshman ) courses in the deductive order described in the previous section .",
    "specifically , we do not usually first develop vector calculus , then exhibit maxwell s equations , then solve for the fields of charges , currents , and radiation , and finally apply these to realistic electromagnetic phenomena .",
    "rather , the typical course posits the fields of the simplest physically relevant examples , for instance the electric field of a point charge , the magnetic field of a straight wire , and the electromagnetic plane wave .",
    "these are used to build understanding of fields and their interaction with charges for immediate application to demonstrable electromagnetic phenomena .",
    "maxwell s ten partial differential equations and their associated gauge and lorentz invariances are better appreciated later , usually in a more advanced course",
    ".    general relativity can be efficiently introduced at an intermediate ( junior / senior ) level following the same ` physics first ' model used in introducing electromagnetism . specifically :    1 .",
    "exhibit the simplest physically important spacetime geometries _ first _",
    ", without derivation ; 2 .",
    "derive the predictions of these geometries for observation by a study of the orbits of test particles and light rays moving in them ; 3 .   apply these predictions to realistic astrophysical situations and compare with experiment and observation ; 4 .   motivate the einstein equation and solve it to show where the spacetime geometries posited in ( 1 ) come from .",
    "these are essentially the same four elements that comprise the deductive approach described in the previous section , but in a different order .",
    "that order has considerable advantages for introducing general relativity at an intermediate level as we now describe :      _ less ` new math ' up front : _ to exhibit a spacetime geometry , the only ` new math ' ideas required are the metric and its relation to distances in space and time . to analyze the motion of test particles in these geometries , only the notions of four - vectors and geodesics are needed .",
    "these three new mathematical ideas are enough to explain in detail a wide range of physical phenomena , such as most of those in table 1 .",
    "further , these three new mathematical ideas are among the simplest parts of a relativist s tool kit to introduce at an intermediate level .",
    "four - vectors are often familiar from special relativity .",
    "geodesics viewed as curves of extremal proper time are special cases of lagrangian mechanics .",
    "the idea of a metric can be motivated from the theory of surfaces in three - dimensional flat space . a general theory of tensors as linear maps from vectors into the real numbers",
    "is not required because only one tensor  the metric  is ever used .",
    ".13 in _ the simplest spacetimes are the most physically relevant : _    *",
    "the sun is approximately spherical .",
    "* spherical black holes exhibit many characteristic properties of the most general black hole . *",
    "the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic on scales above 100 megaparsecs . *",
    "detectable gravitational waves are weak .",
    "these four facts mean that the simplest solutions of the einstein equation are the ones most relevant for experiment and observation .",
    "the static , spherically symmetric schwarzschild geometry describes the solar system experimental tests , spherically symmetric gravitational collapse , and spherical black holes .",
    "the exactly homogeneous and isotropic friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) models provide an excellent approximation to the structure and evolution of our universe from the big bang to the distant future .",
    "the linearized solutions of the einstein equation about a flat space background describe detectable gravitational waves .",
    "a ` physics first ' treatment of general relativity that concentrates on the simplest solutions of the einstein equation is thus immediately relevant for physically realistic and important situations .",
    ".13 in _ no stopping before some physics : _ students with different levels of experience , preparation , abilities , and preconceptions will take different lengths of time to acquire the basic concepts of general relativity . beginning with the applications",
    "guarantees that , wherever the course ends , students will have gained some understanding of the basic physical phenomena ( table 1 ) which make general relativity so important and not simply of a mathematical structure which is the prerequisite for a deductive approach . .13 in _ more concrete , less abstract : _ beginning with the applications rather than the abstract structure of the theory is easier for some students because it is more concrete .",
    "beginning with the applications is also a surer way of driving home that general relativity is a part of physics whose predictions can be observationally tested and not a branch of mathematics .",
    ".13 in _ fewer compromises : _ the analysis of the motion of test particles and light rays in the simplest geometries can be carried out in essentially the same way as it is done in advanced textbooks . no compromises of method or generality are needed .",
    ".13 in _ flexibility in emphasis : _ beginning with applications allows enough time to construct courses with different emphases ; for instance on black holes , gravitational waves , cosmology , or experimental tests .",
    ".13 in _ closer to the rest of the undergraduate physics curriculum : _ calculations of the orbits of test particles and light rays to explore curved spacetimes are exercises in mechanics .",
    "the symmetries of the simplest important solutions imply conservation laws .",
    "these can be used to reduce the calculation of orbits to one - dimensional motion in effective potentials .",
    "even the content of the einstein equation can be put in this form for simple situations .",
    "this allows the intuition and techniques developed in intermediate mechanics to be brought to bear , both for qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction .",
    "conversely , this kind of example serves to extend and reinforce an understanding of mechanics .",
    "indeed , in the author s experience a few students are surprised to find that mechanics is actually useful for something .",
    "the examples discussed in the next section will help illustrate the close connection between calculating geodesics and undergraduate mechanics .",
    ".13 in _ fewer prerequisites : _ the close connection with mechanics described above and in the next section means that the only essential prerequisite to a ` physics first ' exposition of general relativity is an intermediate course in mechanics .",
    "neither quantum mechanics nor electrodynamics are necessary.some acquaintance with special relativity is useful , but its brief treatment in many first year courses means that it is usually necessary to develop it _ de novo _ at the beginning of an introductory course in general relativity .",
    "intermediate mechanics is thus the single essential physics prerequisite .",
    "this means that an introductory ` physics first ' course in general relativity can be accessible to a wider range of physics majors at an earlier stage than courses designed to introduce students to other frontier areas .",
    ".13 in _ closer to research frontiers : _ beginning with the applications means that students are closer sooner to the contemporary frontiers of astrophysics and particle physics that they can hear about in the seminars , read about in the newspapers , and see on popular television programs .",
    ".13 in _ more opportunities for undergraduate participation in research : _ the applications of general relativity provide a broad range of topics for students to pursue independent study or even to make research contributions of contemporary interest .",
    "more importantly , it is possible to identify problems from the applications that are conceptually and technically accessible to undergraduate physics majors and can be completed in the limited time frame typically available .",
    "problems that involve solving for the behavior of test particles , light rays , and gyroscopes are examples , as are questions involving linear gravitational waves , black holes , and simple cosmological models .",
    "the ` physics first ' approach to teaching general relativity enables undergraduate participation in research because it treats such applications first .",
    ".13 in _ specialized faculty not needed : _ learning a subject while teaching it , or learning it better , is a part of every physics instructor s experience .",
    "the absence of previous instruction means that teaching an introductory general relativity course will often be the first exposure to the subject for many faculty .",
    "the process of learning by faculty is made easier by a ` physics first ' approach for the same reasons it is easier for students .",
    "a wider variety of faculty will find this approach both familiar and manageable .",
    "specialists in gravitational physics are not necessary .",
    "no approach to teaching is without its price and the ` physics first ' approach to introducing general relativity is no exception .",
    "the obvious disadvantage is that it does not follow the logically appealing deductive order , although it can get to the same point in the end .",
    "a ` physics first ' approach to introducing general relativity _ may _ not be indicated in at least two circumstances : first , when there is enough time in the curriculum and enough student commitment to pursue the deductive order ; second , when students already have significant preparation in differential geometry . even then however it is a possible alternative .",
    "a ` physics first ' approach is probably not indicated when the mathematics is of central interest , as for students concentrating in mathematics , and for physics students who study einstein s theory mainly as an introduction to the mathematics of string theory .",
    "this section illustrates how the effective potential method developed in typical undergraduate mechanics courses can be applied to important problems in general relativity . of the several possible illustrations ,",
    "just one is considered here  the relativistic effects on test particle orbits outside a spherical star or black hole .",
    "applications of this include the precession of perihelia of planets in the solar system and the location of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) in an accretion disk powering an x - ray source .",
    "these examples also serve to illustrate how near the calculations of such effects are to starting principles in a ` physics first ' approach to general relativity .",

    "a third integral of the motion @xmath43 arises just from the definition of proper time .",
    "this integral can be combined with the other to to find an effective energy integral for the radial motion :    [ sixone ] @xmath44 where @xmath45    here , @xmath0 is the schwarzschild radial coordinate of the test particle and @xmath30    is the proper time along its world line .",

    "but in general relativity there are _ two _ circular orbits for values of @xmath12 such at that used in figure 2 .",
    "there is a stable circular orbit at the _ minimum _ of the effective potential such as one approximating the orbit of the earth in its progress around the sun .",
    "in addition there is an unstable circular orbit at the radius of the _ maximum _ of the effective potential .",

    "that is because the effective potential is everywhere attractive for low @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to newtonian physics , general relativity therefore implies that there is an _",
    "innermost ( smallest @xmath0 ) stable circular orbit _ ( isco ) whose radius is @xmath47 which is @xmath48 times the characteristic radius of the black hole @xmath49 .",
    "the isco is important for the astrophysics of black holes .",

    "the shape of the line is determined by several factors but importantly affected by the gravitational redshift .",
    "that is maximum for radiation from parts of the accretion disk closest to the black hole , ie from the isco .",
    "this defines the red end of the observed line .",
    "another important prediction of general relativity derivable from the effective potential is the shape of bound orbits such as those of the planets .",

    "when the relativistic term in is absent , @xmath59 for all @xmath39 and @xmath12 .",

    "the relativistic correction to @xmath60 makes the orbit precess by small amount @xmath61 on each pass . to lowest order in @xmath62 this is @xmath63 in the solar system the precession is largest for mercury but still only @xmath64 per century .",
    "the confirmation of that prediction @xcite is an important test of general relativity .",
    "the purpose of this section was not to explain or even emphasize the two effects of general relativity on particle orbits that were described here .",
    "rather it was to show three things .",
    "first , that a standard technique developed in undergraduate mechanics can be used to calculate important predictions of general relativity .",
    "the second purpose was to show how close these important applications can come to starting principles in a ` physics first ' approach to teaching general relativity .",
    "introduce the schwarzschild geometry , use the principle of stationary proper time to find the geodesic equations or their integrals , use the effective potential method to qualitatively and quantitatively understand important properties of the orbits e.g. and .",
    "that is just three steps from the basic ideas of metric and geodesics to important applications .",
    "third , both of the applications treated here can be immediately related to contemporary observation and experiment .",
    "particle orbits in the schwarzschild geometry are not the only important problems in which the effective potential method is useful .",
    "motion in the geometry of a rotating black hole , the motion of test light rays in the schwarzschild geometry , and the evolution of the friedman - robertson - walker cosmological models are further examples where it can be usefully applied .",
    "a one quarter ( @xmath65 28 lectures ) ` physics first ' course in general relativity has been a standard junior / senior elective for physics majors at the university of california , santa barbara for approximately thirty years . in the limited span of a quarter",
    "the author is usually able to review special relativity , motivate gravity as geometry , derive the orbits in the schwarzschild geometry in detail , describe the experimental tests , introduce black holes , and develop the friedman - robertson - walker cosmological models .",
    "a semester provides more opportunities .    at santa barbara this course is routinely taught by faculty from many different areas of physics  general relativity of course , but also elementary particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "it has been taught by both theorists and experimentalists . for some of these colleagues teaching",
    "this course was their first serious experience with general relativity .",
    "they usually report that they were successful and enjoyed it .    in the author s experience students",
    "are excited by general relativity and motivated to pursue it .",
    "often it is their first experience with a subject directly relevant to current research .",
    "it is one of the few contemporary subjects that can be taught without quantum mechanics or electromagnetism .",
    "the author has written a text based on the ` physics first ' approach @xcite which comes with a solutions manual available to instructors for the approximately 400 problems of graded levels of difficulty .",
