    "there is strong theoretical evidence that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high - energy ( or small bjorken-@xmath6 ) leads to a non - linear regime where gluon recombination or unitarity effects become important @xcite , resulting in a saturation of parton densities in hadrons and nuclei .",
    "the quest for experimental evidence of the possible signature of gluon saturation phenomenon has been the program of various past or existing experiments from hera and rhic to the lhc , and future experiments such as an electron - ion collider ( eic ) @xcite and the lhec @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , experimental evidence that can unarguably point towards gluon saturation phenomenon , has been elusive so far .",
    "this is because the experiments currently at our disposal are limited in their kinematic coverage , and often other approaches provide alternative descriptions of the same sets of data .",
    "an effective field theory approach that describes the high - energy limit of qcd is the colour glass condensate ( cgc ) , see the review @xcite . in this formalism , the standard quantum evolution equations ( with large logarithms of @xmath9 resummed ) , lead to a situation in which the occupancy of the slow modes in the hadron is so high than they can be treated classically , with the fast modes considered as sources .",
    "the corresponding renormalisation group equations , known in the limit of scattering of a dilute probe on a dense hadron , are the so - called jalilian - marian - iancu - mclerran - weigert - leonidov - kovner ( jimwlk ) hierarchy of equations @xcite or , in the large @xmath10 limit , the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , presently known to next - to - leading accuracy @xcite .",
    "one of the most crucial tests of the cgc ( or saturation ) approach has been its success in the description of the highly precise combined data of the proton structure at hera @xcite alongside data from exclusive diffractive processes in electron - proton collisions , such as exclusive vector meson production and deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite . nevertheless , the standard dglap - type approaches - without inclusion of any saturation effect - give an equally good description of the same data .",
    "while the cgc description can be considered more economical due to the use of a significantly smaller number of fitting parameters , it is limited to small-@xmath6 data and restricted to the gluon sector . on the other hand , in addition to dis and diffractive processes @xcite",
    ", within the cgc framework it is also possible to simultaneously describe other high - energy hadronic interactions in a regime not currently accessible to approaches that rely on collinear factorisation .",
    "for example , in proton - proton @xcite and nuclear collisions @xcite several observables have been successfully addressed : single inclusive hadron @xcite and prompt photon @xcite production , and semi - inclusive photon - hadron @xcite and dihadron @xcite productions .",
    "for a recent review , see ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "exclusive diffractive vector meson production provides a rich testing ground of many qcd novel properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , by measuring the squared momentum transfer @xmath4 , one can study the transverse spatial distribution of the gluons in the hadron wave function that can not be probed in inclusive dis . in this respect ,",
    "new experimental measurements are under way .",
    "the lhcb and alice collaborations have recently released new data on @xmath0 photoproduction with photon - proton center - of - mass energies up to about 1.3 tev @xcite , the highest energy ever measured so far in this kind of reaction . alongside this",
    ", the h1 collaboration also recently reported some new data for @xmath0 with improved precision @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the recently released high - precision combined hera data @xcite that were not available at the time of previous studies of diffractive processes @xcite , provide extra important constraints on saturation models @xcite .",
    "in this work , we analyse these data on exclusive photoproduction of vector mesons off the proton and provide predictions for the kinematics accessible in future experiments .",
    "we show that the freedom to choose the charm mass in the range consistent with global analysis of inclusive observables , results in sizable uncertainties for the total cross - section of elastic photoproduction of vector mesons . nevertheless , we show that , even with these uncertainties , the recent lhc data @xcite seem to favour the saturation picture .",
    "we systematically study elastic diffractive production of different vector mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 off protons and investigate which vector meson production is more sensitive to saturation physics and what measurement can potentially be a better probe of the signal .",
    "in particular , we study @xmath1 diffractive production by constructing the @xmath1 forward wave function via a fit to the leptonic decay , and we provide various predictions for diffractive @xmath1 production as well as the ratio of @xmath8 at hera and the lhc .",
    "furthermore , we find that the corresponding @xmath4-distributions of differential cross - section may unambiguously discriminate among saturation and non - saturation models .",
    "this is due to the emergence of a pronounced dip ( or multiple dips ) in the @xmath4-distribution of diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons at relatively large @xmath5 ( but within reach of future experiments @xcite ) which is directly related to saturation physics . in this way",
    ", we go beyond existing recent works on @xmath0 and @xmath1 production both in the dipole model @xcite and in pqcd @xcite , and of lighter mesons in the dipole model @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the formulation of the colour dipole approach for calculating exclusive diffractive processes . in section iii , we introduce the ip - sat and b - cgc dipole models . in section iv , we present a detailed numerical analysis and our main results . in subsection",
    "a we first show our results and predictions for the total diffractive cross - section of different vector mesons , while in subsection b we discuss the origin of the dips in the @xmath4-distribution of diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons and provide predictions for future experiments .",
    "we summarise our main results in section v.",
    "in the colour dipole formalism , the underlying mechanism for diffractive production of different vector mesons and for inclusive dis is similar .",
    "namely , one must calculate the probability of finding a colour dipole of transverse size @xmath11 with impact parameter @xmath12 in the wave function of a ( real or virtual ) photon or of a vector meson .",
    "similar to the case of the inclusive dis process , the scattering amplitude for the exclusive diffractive process @xmath13 , with a final state vector meson @xmath14 ( or a real photon @xmath15 in dvcs ) , can be written in terms of a convolution of the dipole amplitude @xmath16 and the overlap of the wave functions of the photon and the exclusive final state particle ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , @xmath17\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}}\\mathcal{n}\\left(x , r , b\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and @xmath4 being the squared momentum transfer . in this equation",
    ", @xmath16 is the imaginary part of the forward @xmath19 dipole - proton scattering amplitude with transverse dipole size @xmath11 and impact parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the fraction of the light cone momentum of the virtual photon carried by the quark and @xmath21 denotes the mass of the quark with flavour @xmath22 .",
    "the above expression can be understood in light front time as distinct chronological subprocesses , namely the @xmath23 first fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( the so - called colour @xmath19-dipole ) which then interacts with the target .",
    "finally the @xmath19 pair recombines to form the final state vector meson . in summations over the quark helicities and over the quark flavour @xmath24",
    "are implicit .",
    "the phase factor @xmath25 in the above equation is due to the non - forward wave - function contribution @xcite . in",
    ", the @xmath26 is the forward overlap wave function of photon and vector meson ( see below ) .",
    "the differential cross - section of the exclusive diffractive processes can then be written in terms of the scattering amplitude as @xcite , @xmath27 with [ eq : beta ] & = & ( ) , + r_g ( ) & = & , + & & , where the factor @xmath28 takes into account the missing real part of amplitude ( notice that the amplitude in is purely imaginary ) , with @xmath29 being the ratio of real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath30 incorporates the skewness effect , coming from the fact that the gluons attached to the @xmath19 can carry different light - front fractions @xmath31 of the proton @xcite .",
    "the skewedness factor given in was obtained at nlo level , in the limit that @xmath32 and at small @xmath4 assuming that the diagonal gluon density of target has a power - law form @xcite .",
    "note that there are uncertainties with respect to the actual incorporation of the skewness correction at small @xmath6 in dipole models by a factor @xmath33 with @xmath34}{\\partial\\ln(1/x)}$ ] .",
    "this is consistent with the prescription given in eqs.([vm ] , [ eq : beta ] ) @xcite . ]",

    "in contrast to diffractive dis , the differential cross - section of elastic proton - proton collisions is not currently computable in the weak coupling regime due to the absence of a large scale , and some phenomenological models are often employed ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases multiple parton interactions or multiple pomeron exchanges seem to play an important role in the appearance of dips in the @xmath4-distribution , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "<S> we systematically study exclusive diffractive ( photo ) production of vector mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) off protons in high - energy collisions and investigate whether the production is a sensitive probe of gluon saturation . </S>",
    "<S> we confront saturation - based results for diffractive @xmath1 and @xmath3 production at hera and @xmath0 photoproduction with all available data including recent ones from hera , alice and lhcb , finding good agreement . in particular , we show that the @xmath4-distribution of differential cross sections of photoproduction of vector mesons offers a unique opportunity to discriminate among saturation and non - saturation models . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the emergence of a pronounced dip ( or multiple dips ) in the @xmath4-distribution of diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons at relatively large , but potentially accessible @xmath5 that can be traced back to the unitarity features of colour dipole amplitude in the saturation regime . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in saturation models the dips in @xmath4-distribution recede towards lower @xmath5 with decreasing mass of the vector meson , increasing energy or decreasing bjorken-@xmath6 , and decreasing virtuality @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide various predictions for exclusive ( photo ) production of different vector mesons including the ratio of @xmath8 at hera , the lhc , and future colliders . </S>"
