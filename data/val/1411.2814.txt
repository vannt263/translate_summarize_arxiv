    "in a previous article@xcite it has been shown , that the shift of the interference pattern in the aharonov - bohm [ ab ] effect@xcite , is due to a nonlocal dynamical exchange of a gauge invariant quantity between the charged particle and the flux line . on a basic level , this relates to the question concerning the role of the electromagnetic potentials in quantum theory .",
    "obviously , the non - gauge - invariant potentials are an auxiliary mathematical tool , with no physical significance .",
    "the quantity in question is modulo velocity or @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the separation between the particle s wave packets , see figure 1 .",
    "the exchange occurs instantly , when the ( imaginary ) line connecting the two wave packets crosses the flux line ( if one ignores the time it takes the wave packets to pass by the flux line ) .",
    "it also occurs non locally , since the wave packets are separated and have not completed a closed loop .",
    "there arises the question , how to translate this into an observable effect ?",
    "the problem is , that one can not measure directly functions of momentum such as @xmath4 since it violates the continuity equation .",
    "thus , one considers the particle s velocity distribution @xmath5 .",
    "one can show that its fourier transform , which is directly related to @xmath2 , changes . by comparison , none of the moments of momentum @xmath6 changes .",
    "however , in order to demonstrate the instantaneous change of the velocity distribution , it is necessary that the velocity may be measured in as short a time as desired .",
    "below , it is shown that the time needed to measure velocity tends to zero in non relativistic theory .",
    "in relativistic theory there is a limitation , and velocity can not be measured in a time shorter than @xmath7 .",
    "still , to a good approximation , this may be considered an instantaneous measurement . since a measurement of velocity",
    "does not change the velocity , an observed shift of the velocity distribution will attest that the change existed prior to the measurement , i.e. , shortly after the wave packets passed by the flux line .    [ [ section ] ]    it is also shown that the application of von neumann s measurement theory@xcite to the measurement of velocity@xcite is straightforward , although the theory applies to canonical variables , while velocity is a non canonical variable . in particular , a measurement of velocity which involves two successive position measurements is considered .",
    "it seems , that in quantum theory such a measurement is impossible , for already the first position measurement changes the velocity in an uncertain way .",
    "however , by applying an additional interaction to the measuring device@xcite@xcite , it is possible to cancel the effect of the measurement on its _ recording _ , so that it monitors the distance that the _ unmeasured particle _ would have travelled during the time of measurement .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    after a brief introduction of von neumann s theory , its application to the measurement of position@xmath8 and to the measurement of velocity@xmath9 , the measurement of velocity by means of two position measurements is described@xmath10 . in section @xmath11 , the ab case is addressed . in section @xmath12 ,",
    "two gedanken experiments are described .",
    "von neumann s central claim was that , not only in classical physics but also in non relativistic quantum theory , any canonical dynamical variable may be measured to any required accuracy and in as short a time as desired , _ without changing it _ , and that this is achieved by using the coupling @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are canonical dynamical variables that pertain to the observed system and measuring device , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the object of the measurement .",
    "@xmath16 is a gate function : @xmath17 in the interval @xmath18 $ ] and equals to zero otherwise .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath19 , while @xmath20 remains finite and , specifically , that @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath16 effects an _ impulsive measurement_. note that @xmath22 is a generalization of the stern gerlach interaction .    [ [ section-2 ] ]    rather than continuing in general terms , let us consider the measurement of a particle s instantaneous position @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", the interaction is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coordinate of the measuring device .",
    "the overall hamiltonian is then @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the masses of the observed particle and the measuring device , and the momenta @xmath29 and @xmath30 are canonically conjugate to the coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the measuring device is very heavy so that its kinetic energy term may be ignored .",
    "we thus consider the hamiltonian @xmath32 the most basic requirement from a measurement is , that there exists a variable of the measuring device , the `` pointer '' , whose change during the measurement is proportional to the quantity that we want to measure . in the present case , @xmath30 is the pointer .",
    "we have @xmath33@xcite .",
    "after the measurement , the pointer s displacement @xmath34 is given by @xmath35\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : ii : i:3}\\ ] ] a result of a measurement is meaningful only if the pointer s displacement is much larger than the error , or , if @xmath36 it is also assumed that the pointer is sharp , i.e. , the uncertainty @xmath37 is small . thus , for a good measurement of the position @xmath38 it is necessary that @xmath39 as well as that the additional third term in the square brackets of @xmath40 may be ignored , i.e. , @xmath41 during the measurement , the observed particle is accelerated by a large , uncertain amount , @xmath42 , which is @xmath43 for an electron .",
    "thus , @xmath44 means that this acceleration may be ignored at the impulsive limit .",
    "alternatively , one can assume that the kinetic energy is negligible compared to the interaction .",
    "either way , the particle s position does not change perceptibly during the time of measurement , which confirms von neumann s claim .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    to conclude , the conditions @xmath45 and @xmath44 guarantee that the particle s instantaneous position at @xmath46 is being measured .",
    "however , after the measurement , the particle s velocity @xmath47 is very uncertain .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    note that to avoid the relativistic domain , the uncertain velocity must satisfy @xmath48 , from which it follows that the uncertainty of the measured position @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the particle s compton wavelength . the duration of the measurement is limited as well , by @xmath51 , @xmath52 sec for an electron . in non relativistic theory defined by @xmath53 ,",
    "the instantaneous position may be measured to any desired accuracy and in as short a time as one may wish .",
    "von neumann s measurement theory applies to the measurement of canonical variables .",
    "velocity , however , is a non canonical variable , since it is defined by hamilton s equation rather than as an independent degree of freedom .",
    "thus , the measurement of velocity involves the hamiltonian @xmath54 where the gate function is defined by @xmath55 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 otherwise .",
    "this definition of the hamiltonian seems to be circular .",
    "however , it is not .",
    "we have for the velocity @xmath63 since all non relativistic hamiltonians , including the unknown @xmath64 , are of second order in @xmath29 at most , the term involving @xmath65 in @xmath66 is of first order in @xmath29 at most .",
    "thus @xmath67 note that this result is independent of the ( possible ) presence of an external vector potential , which has therefore been omitted .",
    "we obtain @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    ". however , with this hamiltonian we have for the pointer @xmath70 .",
    "since we want to measure the observed particle s original , unperturbed velocity , the @xmath25 dependence is undesirable .",
    "it may be eliminated by adding a compensatory interaction .",
    "we finally obtain , @xmath71^{2 } } { 2m}-\\frac{g^{2}(t)q^{2}}{2m}\\,,\\ ] ] where now @xmath72 , as desired .",
    "below , it is shown that it is possible to measure velocity by means of two position measurements .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath73 the two position measurements are separated by an interval @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath74 is a dirac @xmath75 function .",
    "the last term is the compensation term .",
    "the kinetic energy of the measuring device has been ignored also in between the two position measurements .",
    "this entails that @xmath76 .",
    "following the discussion in section @xmath8 , the particle s kinetic energy may be ignored during the interaction times @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "thus , after the measurement , the pointer s displacement is given by @xmath78+aq(0 ) \\nonumber \\\\     & = & g\\frac{p_{y}(0)-g q(0)}{m}t+aq(0 ) \\nonumber \\\\     & = & gtv_{y}(0)\\ ; \\leftrightarrow\\ ; a=\\frac{g^{2}t}{m}\\,.\\label{eq : ii : iii:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the compensation term properly tuned , the measuring device records _",
    "the distance the particle would have traveled if it were not perturbed by the measurement_. in other words , it measures the particle s original velocity .",
    "following @xmath79 we assume @xmath80 .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ] +    after the second `` hit '' , with a reversed force , the particle s velocity returns to its initial value , but with a greatly reduced uncertainty @xmath81 , yet the product of the uncertainties remains @xmath82 after the measurement , the uncertainty of the particle s position is greatly increased .",
    "this is since the particle moves at an uncertain velocity during the measurement .",
    "thus , it is the uncertain vector potential appearing during the measurement , that `` saves '' the uncertainty principle from being violated .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ] +    finally , note that the general measurement of velocity involving the time dependent vector potential , arrived at in section @xmath9 , is equivalent , up to a gauge transformation , to that involving two position measurements described here .",
    "the pertinent gauge transformation is @xmath83 .",
    "thus , all one dimensional von neumann velocity measurements are equivalent to a two - positions - measurement , and share the same characteristic features , namely the reversed forces effective at the beginning and the end and an uncertain velocity in between .",
    "i now relate specifically to the measurement of velocity in the context of the ab set - up .",
    "note that , in order to obtain the velocity distribution , all one needs to do is to repeat the measurement of the velocity for a large number of times @xmath84 , and count the number @xmath85 of times the result @xmath86 is obtained , i.e. , @xmath87 .",

    "@xcite it has been shown that when the line connecting the wave packets crosses the flux line , the fourier transforms for @xmath97 change by @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the magnetic flux in the @xmath101 direction and @xmath102 is the charge .",
    "the velocity distribution is given by @xmath103 .",
    "using ( [ eq : iii:1 ] ) , one obtains that on passing by the flux line , it changes .",
    "thus , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the velocity distribution of a single wave packet .",
    "equation ( [ eq : iii:1 ] ) implies that the evolution of the charged particle in the vicinity of the flux line is essentially a one dimensional problem . in particular ,",
    "the velocity distributions @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath107 , together with position distribution @xmath108 $ ] determine the states up to a choice of gauge .",

    "henceforth , the evolution of the charged particle is given in terms of these two one - dimensional states .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    we now turn to the measurement of velocity . in the present context",
    "we shall use the schr@xmath112dinger picture , where the resolution of the velocity paradox mentioned in the introduction becomes intuitively clear .",
    "let us consider the particle s evolution .",
    "we have , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the state of the entire system , i.e. , measuring device and measured particle .",
    "@xmath115 stands for time ordering .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath116 .",
    "we obtain@xcite @xmath117 provided @xmath118 . @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the wave functions of the measuring device and the measured particle , respectively . since we are interested in the state of the particle after it has passed by the flux line , we substitute @xmath121 .",
    "equation @xmath122 describes the state of the system after the measurement .",
    "the pointer is displaced by an amount that is proportional to the particle s velocity . however , according to the physical interpretation of quantum theory , with the observed system in a state @xmath123 , a measurement of an observable @xmath124 results , with probability @xmath125 , in one of its eigenvalues @xmath126 , with the observed system jumping into the corresponding eigenstate @xmath127 .",
    "thus , with a measurement of the particle s velocity , we have to expand its state in eigenstates of velocity , @xmath128 where @xmath129 , @xmath130 , are the fourier transforms of the wave functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively@xcite . substituting eqn . @xmath133 into eqn .",
    "@xmath122 we finally obtain @xmath134 with the pointer variable @xmath30 sufficiently sharp , its uncertainty @xmath135 a sufficiently accurate measurement of the particle s velocity is possible . for an electron the change of velocity associated with modulo momentum , or the relative phase , is @xmath136 , where we have taken @xmath137 as in the late professor tonomura s sample@xcite .",
    "> from @xmath138 it follows that the pointer is displaced by @xmath139 with probability @xmath140 .",
    "this is exactly the shifted velocity distribution @xmath107 which we set out to measure .",
    "thus , @xmath138 and @xmath141 demonstrate that it is possible to observe the shift of the velocity distribution affected by the flux line .",
    "it is also clear from equation @xmath142 that the measurement did not change the velocity distribution .",
    "this illustrates , in the schr@xmath112dinger picture , the statement that a measurement of an observable @xmath124 should not change it , namely , that it should not change its probability distribution .",
    "clearly , a measurement of velocity could not change any function of velocity such as the projection operator to one of its eigenvalues , regardless of the method by which the velocity is measured .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    note that in the case when there is a relative velocity between the wave packets , as with the superposition @xmath143 $ ] , the velocity distributions of the two wave packets do not overlap and no shift of the velocity distribution is observed .",
    "however , by applying a suitable impulse to the wave packets the relative velocity may be annulled .",
    "the ensuing velocity distribution will display the @xmath144-dependent shift . repeating the experiment _ without _ a flux line will prove that the relative phase existed in the original state , before the forces were applied .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    note also that there is a relativistic limitation on the measurement of instantaneous velocity in the ab case .",
    "since the particle s uncertain intermediate velocity can not exceed @xmath145 , it follows from equation @xmath146 that @xmath147 this is a limitation on measurements in the modulo region .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    to conclude : in the ab effect , the change of the velocity distribution of the charged particle occurs instantly .",
    "however , because of the separation @xmath3 between the wave packets , the duration of the _ measurement _ of the particle s velocity is bounded from below by @xmath148sec .",
    "this gap in time is responsible for a discrepancy which exists in relativistic quantum theory , between what the theory predicts and what is observable .",
    "however , for @xmath149 ( @xmath150 is the travel - time of the particle throughout the ab experiment ) and , in particular , by varying @xmath150 while keeping @xmath151 constant , the abrupt change of the velocity distribution _ in the vicinity of the flux line _ may be convincingly demonstrated .",
    "consider the ab set - up in the charged particle s rest frame , where the flux line moves with velocity -@xmath152 . in this reference frame",
    "the particle experiences only an electric ab effect , with the electric flux being equal to the magnetic flux in the flux line s rest frame .",
    "the particle s velocity is measured twice , before the flux line has crossed the line connecting the wave packets , and immediately afterwards .",
    "two position measurements involving the von neumann coupling @xmath153 and a compensation are used to measure velocity .",
    "thus the abrupt change of the velocity distribution in the ab effect may be experimentally tested .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    alternatively , the gauge invariant non local exchange may be tested by the interference experiment described in figure 2 . here , again , a typical ab set - up , except for a certain modification : initially , no flux is threading the area enclosed by the ( future ) trajectories of the two wave packets . shortly before the wave packets are about to pass by , at a certain @xmath154 , say , the flux line is inserted into that area . immediately after the particle has passed by the flux line , the latter is removed again .",
    "thus , when the wave packets are brought together to interfere , there is no flux within the closed loop outlined by the wave packets .",
    "it seems that @xmath155 , and one may be led to expect no shift of the interference pattern .",
    "however , since the line connecting the wave packets did cross the flux line before it was removed , the exchange must have occurred .",
    "the removal of the flux line does not undo this .",
    "thus , a shift of the interference pattern should occur .",
    "this prediction , if experimentally confirmed , demonstrates that the ab effect is contingent on the gauge invariant non local exchange , and on it alone .",
    "it is shown in this paper that it is possible to verify experimentally the sudden shift of the velocity distribution occurring non locally in the ab effect .",
