    "as opposed to conventional charge density waves , @xcite that are well understood in terms of lattice - driven instabilities of the fermi surface in metallic systems , there is no unified description of the charge ordering ( co ) transitions observed in strongly interacting systems , or `` bad metals '' .",
    "typical examples of such systems are transition - metal oxides , which are invariably characterized by a complex interplay between several microscopic interactions , involving the charge , spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "this complexity seems to preclude the identification of a simple , common , charge ordering mechanism .",
    "still , electron - lattice interactions are always present to some extent , and often play a dominant role in driving the co transition in these systems .",
    "charge ordering phenomena involving a strong electron - lattice coupling have been found in manganites,@xcite nickelates,@xcite layered cobaltates,@xcite magnetite , @xcite vanadates , @xcite oxoborates,@xcite as well as in other inorganic low - dimensional systems.@xcite the lattice degrees of freedom could also be relevant in the charge ordered phases of the so - called `` telephone - number '' ladder compounds,@xcite as well as in two - dimensional organic salts,@xcite although in those cases most theoretical interpretations up to now have focused on models with purely electronic interactions .    in this work we focus on a minimal model which describes charge ordering in the presence of electron - lattice interactions , with particular attention to the polaronic regime obtained at strong coupling .",
    "the model consists of electrons on a bipartite lattice , at a commensurate concentration of one electron on every two sites , interacting locally with dispersionless lattice vibrations .",
    "the electrons also interact mutually via an intersite electrostatic repulsion , which can be thought of as the screened part of the long - ranged coulomb potential .",
    "while this oversimplified model only retains part of the complex physics involved in real systems , its solution can be helpful to clarify certain aspects of the charge ordering phenomena that are common to systems with strong electron - lattice interactions , and that can in principle be identified experimentally . to be specific ,",
    "we solve the model by performing the following approximations :    \\(i ) the magnetic degrees of freedom are taken out of the game by resorting to spinless electrons .",
    "this enforces locally the constraint of no double occupancy characteristic of the limit of strong `` hubbard '' ( on - site ) repulsion .",
    "it is appropriate for our purposes , as long as we do not aim at describing the effects of electronic correlations on the low - energy physics , such as the existence of a quasi - particle peak or the induced magnetic exchange . in principle",
    ", this approximation is viable as long as the magnetic and charge degrees of freedom are governed by different energy scales . in such case ,",
    "the magnetic interactions are not expected to have a strong influence on the charge ordering pattern ( although exceptions do exist @xcite ) .",
    "this separation of energy scales is realized for instance in magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1),@xcite where the co transition occurs within a ferromagnetic phase that preexists at a much higher temperature .",
    "more examples can be found in systems ( such as v@xmath0o@xmath2 @xcite ) where the co transition takes place within a paramagnetic phase , the magnetic order setting in at a much lower temperature .",
    "the spinless approximation is also relevant to half - metals such as the colossal magnetoresistance manganites .",
    "\\(ii ) we consider a single electronic band , which rules out the orbital degrees of freedom and their possible ordering , that is known to play an important role in specific compounds .",
    "\\(iii ) the lattice vibrations are assumed adiabatic , i.e. their characteristic energy is much smaller than the electronic bandwidth , which is typically the case in transition - metal oxides .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is enforced here by treating the lattice degrees of freedom as static variables with a given ( thermal ) statistical distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "the low - energy spectral features that derive from the quantum nature of the phonons are lost .",
    "these would appear at energies comparable to , or below the phonon energies . such features are anyhow of minor quantitative importance in the polaronic regime of interest here , where most of the spectral weight is moved to higher energies , of the order of the polaron binding energy .",
    "the same argument justifies the neglect of low - energy phenomena originating from electronic correlations as discussed at point ( i ) above , in all cases where the polarons set the dominant energy scale .",
    "\\(iv ) we apply single - site dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , appropriately adapted@xcite to account for the charge unbalance between neighboring sites in the charge ordered state .",
    "this approach is known to deal very effectively with local interaction mechanisms , regardless of their strength .",
    "it is therefore expected to give an accurate description of the electron - lattice physics . as was shown in ref .",
    ", this approach correctly describes the crossover between the weak coupling charge density wave regime and strong - coupling polaronic regime , and allows to shed light on the role played by defects of the lattice polarization at the ordering transition .",
    "a lesser accuracy is achieved in treating the inter - site coulomb repulsion , since non - local interactions reduce to the mean - field ( hartree ) level in single - site dmft .",
    "this is however not a primary limitation@xcite in the regime we are mainly interested in , where the physics is dominated by the electron - lattice interaction .",
    "the main result of this work is the identification of qualitatively different behaviors of the electrodynamic response in the two fundamentally distinct regimes of charge ordering , governed by the strength of the electron - lattice interaction . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "the electrodynamic response is dominated by the opening of an energy gap in the excitation spectrum of an otherwise metallic system . at the ordering transition ,",
    "the optical spectral weight is transferred from the drude peak to the region above the gap , and the d.c .",
    "conductivity acquires a semiconducting character . on the contrary , in the strong coupling limit",
    ", charge localization is already present in the normal phase , due to the formation of self - localized polarons .",
    "correspondingly , the low energy spectrum is already strongly depleted by a polaronic `` pseudo - gap '' , and the genuine gap opening occurring at the transition does not give rise to any appreciable depletion or shift of the low frequency spectral weight .",
    "instead , the ordering of polarons results in a global enhancement of the optical spectral weight , which is opposite to what is expected from a conventional charge density wave . the two scenarios described above coexist in the polaronic regime at moderate values of the electron - lattice coupling .",
    "this leads to a complex behavior presenting both a transfer and an enhancement of the spectral weight , resulting in a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the total optical weight within the co phase .",
    "the inclusion of a direct intersite coulomb interaction extends this complex intermediate region to larger electron - lattice interaction strengths .",
    "the solution for the one - particle spectral function has already been published in ref .",
    ", in a model with electron - lattice interactions alone . here",
    "we extend that treatment to calculate the optical and d.c .",
    "conductivity throughout the parameter space , including an intersite coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "we also derive analytical expressions for these quantities that are valid in the polaronic regime , elucidating the role played by charge defects in both optical absorption and charge transport .",
    "it can be noted that an analogous model , without the coulomb interaction term , was studied variationally in ref . .",
    "there , however , the physics of defects was not addressed .",

    "in addition to this electron - phonon interaction _  la holstein _ , the electrons interact mutually via a nearest neighbor repulsion term @xmath9 of coulomb origin .",
    "the scaling of the repulsive term is chosen in such a way that the energy cost for a deviation from perfect charge ordering ( i.e. flipping an occupied and an empty site ) equals @xmath9 .",
    "the scaling of the kinetic term @xmath10 yields a finite free - electron bandwidth in the limit of infinite connectivity ( number of nearest neighbors @xmath11 ) .",
    "we shall consider for simplicity a semi - elliptical density of states ( dos ) of half - width @xmath12 , corresponding to a bethe lattice of infinite connectivity .",
    "nevertheless , the present calculation scheme can be easily generalized to other model dos , to include more realistic band structures as obtained for example from ab - initio calculations of specific systems .",

    "the formalism needed to treat the electron - phonon interaction was set up in ref . by mapping the original lattice problem onto a pair of coupled impurity models . in the limit of infinite connectivity , any additional non - local interaction term self - averages to its mean - field ( hartree ) value .",
    "therefore , the extra coulomb term can be straightforwardly included via a site dependent chemical potential shift in the weiss fields , i. e. the local fields that take into account the effects of the electron itinerancy .",

    "such bell shape originates from the different mechanisms that drive the charge ordering in the two limiting regimes of small and large @xmath34 . at weak coupling ,",

    "a certain number of defects exist within the co phase , in the form of charges localized on the `` wrong '' sublattice .",
    "the existence of such thermally - induced defects is intimately related to the existence of local lattice distortions in the normal phase , i.e. polaron formation.@xcite we can therefore identify the existence of a _ polaronic _ co phase , as opposed to the weak - coupling charge density wave , as the phase in which these defects are present .    the defect phase can be quantitatively characterized by analyzing the sublattice pdf s , which acquire a bimodal structure for sufficiently large @xmath34 .",
