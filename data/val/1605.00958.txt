    "the amplification of the electromagnetic wave is thus the case when the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the phase velocity of the wave , /q|v_dr.[condition ] under this condition the electron flow transmits its energy to the wave and amplifies it ; under the opposite condition the wave transmits its energy to the electron system which leads to an additional damping of the wave and to the electron drag effect ( not studied here ) .",

    "[ fig : abs5],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    finally , we would like to discuss the following point .",
    "the absolute value of the amplification factor @xmath182 was found to be rather small , below @xmath195% , which is mainly due to the low density of electrons in a system which has only one ( structured ) monolayer of carbon atoms . naturally the question arises , whether the factor @xmath182 can be increased by forming a many - layered system of parallel graphene - nanoribbon arrays .",

    "the maximum negative absorption @xmath182 is about @xmath185% .",
    "when @xmath94 increases , the absolute value of @xmath182 first grows with @xmath94 , indeed , but at @xmath196 it reaches a maximum ( @xmath197% ) and then decreases again . such a behavior becomes clear from eqs .",

    "the suppression of the factor @xmath182 at large @xmath94 is thus due to the dielectric function ( [ dielfuncdriven ] ) .",
    "this suppression is unavoidable but may depend on ( and be controlled by ) the specific dielectric environment . by a special design of the environment one can probably increase the absolute value of the amplification factor @xmath182 but this problem is not considered in the present work .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the wave - vector , frequency , dc electric field , scattering rate , electron density , temperature and the number - of - layers dependence of the dynamic conductivity , dielectric function and the absorption coefficient in a direct current driven array of graphene nanoribbons .",
    "the influence of the dc electric field is taken into account non - perturbatively , the influence of the ac field  within the linear response theory , the scattering processes  within the simple relaxation time approximation .",
    "we have shown that , at frequencies satisfying the condition ( [ condition ] ) , the propagating electromagnetic wave can be amplified at the expense of the energy of the direct current source .",
    "we have analyzed the optimal conditions for the wave amplification depending on all system parameters .",
    "we have assumed that the external electric field acting on the system is given by the formula ( [ extfield ] ) but did not discuss how the ac part of this field is created .",
    "this can be done by different means .",
    "for example , the running electric - field wave can be produced by the surface acoustic waves propagating along the surface of a piezoelectric material covered by graphene @xcite , a semiconductor 2d crystal @xcite , or by a graphene nanostructure as considered in this paper . in this case",
    "the phase velocity of the wave is about @xmath201 cm / s ( @xmath202 ) and the required drift velocity and the dc electric field are very low ( @xmath203 , @xmath127 ) , see figure [ fig : aveveloc ] .",
    "another opportunity to create the running electric - field wave ( [ extfield ] ) is to irradiate the graphene - nanoribbon array with an adjacent grating structure by electromagnetic radiation@xcite .",
    "the grating transforms the incident wave to the electromagnetic excitation running along the 2d layer with the phase velocity @xmath204 ( with @xmath205 being the speed of light ) , thus realizing a smith - purcell - type emitter of radiation @xcite . in this case",
    "the phase velocity of the wave can be comparable with the fermi velocity of electrons in graphene , @xmath206 cm / s , which make it feasible to extend the operation frequency range up to terahertz .",
    "attempts to realize such emitters of terahertz radiation have been made in the past on the basis of semiconductor structures @xcite , for reviews see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently it has been proposed to use graphene for this purpose @xcite .",
    "this work thus contributes to the realization of graphene - based voltage - tunable emitters of sub - terahertz and terahertz radiation .",
