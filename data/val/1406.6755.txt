    "invariant set is an important concept in the theory of dynamical systems and it has a wide range of applications in control .",
    "one of the reasons of the interest is due to the fact that invariant sets enable us to estimate the attraction region of a dynamical system .",
    "we consider linear continuous dynamical systems in the form @xmath0 and discrete dynamical systems in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the state variables , @xmath3 are the coefficient matrices , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 indicate continuous and discrete time steps , respectively .",
    "note that equations ( [ dyna1 ] ) and ( [ dyna2 ] ) can be treated as autonomous systems or as controlled systems . in the latter case ,",
    "the coefficient matrix @xmath6 @xmath7 can be represented in the form of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the open - loop state matrix , @xmath10 is the control matrix , and @xmath11 is the gain matrix . for simplicity , we use the term system to indicate dynamical system .    intuitively , a set @xmath12 is called an invariant set for a system , if all the trajectories of the system , which are starting in @xmath12 , remain in @xmath12 .",
    "numerous surveys on the theory and applications of invariant sets are published in the recent decades , see e.g. , blanchini @xcite .",
    "recently , several sufficient and necessary conditions , which are simply refereed to as invariance conditions , are derived to verify if a set is an invariant set for a continuous or discrete system .",
    "various convex sets with different characteristics are considered as candidates for invariant sets .",
    "invariance conditions for polyhedra are given in @xcite .",
    "ellipsoidal sets as invariant sets are analyzed in @xcite .",
    "cones as invariant sets are studied in @xcite .",
    "a novel unified approach to derive invariance conditions for polyhedra , ellipsoids , and cones is presented in @xcite .",
    "although many mathematical techniques are developed to directly solve continuous systems , in practice , one usually solves a continuous system by applying certain discretization methods .",
    "assume that a set is an invariant set for a continuous system , then it should be also an invariant set for the discrete system , which is obtained by the discretization method , i.e. , discretization should preserve the invariance . however , this is not always true for every steplength used in the discretization method , thus it will be convenient if there exists a predictable threshold for valid invariance preserving steplength . the existence of such steplength thresholds of invariance preserving on various sets is thoroughly studied in @xcite . in this paper , we consider three types of discretization methods on polyhedra and we aim to derive valid thresholds of the steplength in terms of explicit form or obtained by using efficiently computable algorithms .",
    "the popularity of polyhedra as invariant sets is due to the fact that the state and control variables are usually represented in terms of linear inequalities .",
    "for taylor approximation type discretization methods , i.e. , the coefficient matrix of the discrete system is derived from the taylor expansion of @xmath13 , we present an algorithm to derive a valid steplength threshold for invariance preserving . in particular , the algorithm aims to find the first positive zeros of some polynomial functions related to the system and the polyhedron . for general rational function type discretization methods ,",
    "i.e. , the coefficient matrix of the discrete system is a rational function with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath14 , we derive a valid steplength threshold for invariance preserving that can be computed by using analogous methods as for the case of taylor approximation type methods .",
    "this steplength threshold is related to the steplength threshold for the forward euler method and the radius of absolute monotonicity of the discretization method .",
    "we note that this result is similar to the one presented in @xcite , where runge - kutta methods are considered .",
    "finally , we propose an optimization model to find the largest steplength threshold for the forward euler method .",
    "we note that some results on the use of the forward euler method to analyze invariance for continuous dynamical systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "_ notation _ : for the sake of simplicity , the following notational conventions are introduced .",
    "a _ nonnegative _ matrix , denoted by @xmath15 , means that all entries of @xmath16 are nonnegative .",
    "an _ off - diagonal nonnegative _ matrix , denoted by @xmath17 , means that all entries , except the diagonal entries , of @xmath16 are nonnegative .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : back ] , some fundamental concepts , theorems , and the key problems in this paper are introduced . in section [ sec : main ] , we present our main results , i.e. , deriving valid steplength thresholds for invariance preserving , for the three types of discretization methods . finally , conclusions are provided in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "we now introduce the definitions of invariant sets for continuous and discrete systems .",
    "[ def1 ] a set @xmath12 in @xmath18 is an invariant set for    * the continuous system ( [ dyna1 ] ) if @xmath19 @xmath12 implies @xmath20 , for all @xmath21 . * the discrete system ( [ dyna2 ] ) if @xmath22 implies @xmath23 , for all @xmath5 .",
    "according to the definitions of invariant sets , we have that an invariant set means that the continuous ( or discrete ) trajectory of the system remains in the same set .",
    "in fact , there is an alternative perspective , see e.g. , @xcite . in that interpretation @xmath12 is an invariant set for ( [ dyna1 ] ) if and only if @xmath24 for any @xmath21 , and @xmath12 is an invariant set for ( [ dyna2 ] ) if and only if @xmath25    in this paper , candidate invariant sets are restricted to convex polyhedron in @xmath18 .",
    "a polyhedron @xmath26 in @xmath27 can be characterized as the intersection of a finite number of half spaces .",
    "a polyhedron @xmath26 in @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31\\in \\mathbb{r}^{n\\times m } $ ] .",
    "two classical subsets of polyhedra are extensively studied in many applications .",
    "one is called polytope , which is a bounded polyhedron .",
    "the other one is called polyhedral cone , a polyhedron with @xmath32 in ( [ poly1 ] ) , and the origin is its only vertex .    given a system and a polyhedron , the invariance condition indicates sufficient and necessary condition such that the polyhedron is an invariant set for the system .",
    "there are many such equivalent invariance conditions , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the most common ones are presented in theorem [ poly ] .",
    "a novel and unified approach to derive these invariance conditions is proposed in @xcite .",
    "the invariance conditions in theorem [ poly ] provide powerful and practical tools to verify whether a polyhedron is an invariant set for a given system .",
    "@xcite _ a polyhedron @xmath26 given in the form of ( [ poly1 ] ) is an invariant set for    * the continuous system ( [ dyna1 ] ) if and only if there exists an @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 * the discrete system ( [ dyna2 ] ) if and only if there exists an @xmath35 , such that @xmath36    from the theoretical perspective , when a discretization method is applied to a continuous system , the invariant polyhedron for the continuous system should also be an invariant set for the discrete system .",
    "this means that conditions ( [ invcont ] ) and ( [ invdis ] ) are satisfied simultaneously , when the system , polyhedron , and discretization method are given .",
    "however , this is not always true . intuitively , the smaller steplength used in the discretization method has larger possibility to yield that the polyhedron is also an invariant set for the discrete system . for the sake of self - contained presentation , the formal definitions of invariance preserving and steplength threshold",

    "this is an important property . in certain cases ,",
    "a discretization method may be invariance preserving on a set in the form of @xmath42\\cup[\\tau_2,\\tau_3]$ ] , where @xmath43 here we are only interested in finding @xmath44 .",
    "we also note that the steplength threshold in definition [ invpre ] is uniform on @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath40 needs to be a valid steplenth threshold for every initial point in @xmath26 .",
    "since a continuous system is usually solved by using various discretization methods in practice , invariance preserving property of the chosen discretization method plays an important role .",
    "further , a larger steplength threshold has many advantages in practice .",
    "for example , for larger steplength , the size of the discretized system is smaller , which yields that the computation is less expensive .",

    "in this section , we present the approaches for computing a valid ( or largest ) steplength threshold such that three classes of discretization methods are invariance preserving on a polyhedron .",
    "these three classes of discretization methods are considered in the following order : taylor approximation type discretization methods , rational function type discretizatin methods , and the forward euler method .",
    "the taylor approximation type represents a family of explicit methods .",
    "the rational function type is an extended family of the taylor approximation type , which also includes some implicit methods .",
