    "the problem of fluctuation statistics in mesoscopic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is a rich one - even , somewhat surprisingly , for the noninteracting bose gas , as well as for the interacting bose gas @xcite .",
    "take , for example , a trapped gas of @xmath0 bosons , and lower the temperature below the critical temperature @xmath1 to form a condensate .",
    "count the number of atoms that are in the condensate .",
    "do this many times at the same temperature and total boson number @xmath0 to get statistics .",
    "what is the distribution of the condensed atoms , and how does it change when moving the temperature through @xmath2 ?",
    "the noninteracting , mesoscopic , bose gas is a problem whose fluctuation characteristics are still not completely understood .",
    "contrary to standard lore , we stress that the fluctuations are not gaussian , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the discussion goes clear back to the uhlenbeck - einstein dilemma @xcite : uhlenbeck s criticism that einstein s expression for the average boson number @xmath3 had an abrupt cusp at @xmath1 .",
    "the manner in which this cusp is smoothed by fluctuations is of great interest for mesoscopic systems , which is one focus of the present paper .",
    "even more subtle is the question of the higher order moments of the condensate fluctuations , especially in the vicinity of @xmath1 .    despite the conceptual simplicity of the above question ,",
    "the fluctuation statistics are not known analytically , because while the canonical ensemble partition function can be formally written , it can be accurately calculated only numerically .",
    "we note that the work by holthaus and kalinowski obtains accurate approximations for the first few moments , employing a refined saddle point approximation of the canonical partition function @xcite",
    ". however , the equation for the saddle point still has to be solved numerically .",
    "the time - dependent master equation is an excellent alternative approach to attack this question , developed in the pioneering papers of scully @xcite ( hereafter referred to as cnb1 ) and kocharovsky , scully , zhu and zubairy @xcite ( hereafter referred to as cnb2 ) .",
    "this approach is capable of investigating dynamical phenomena , as well as being a viable option when we include interactions , or when the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "the master equation approach , within the canonical framework , has successfully calculated moments of the fluctuation distribution to good accuracy . other advantages of this method are that it provides a simple physical picture of the condensation process with a gas of cold atoms via a detailed balance of the elementary processes of heating and cooling , and that the theory shows a vivid analogy between atom bec and the photon laser by demonstrating that the bec and laser master equations are identical .",
    "this analogy can explain the atom - laser linewidth @xcite , and might also be able to explain the transient dynamics of the phase transition to bec . in the master equation approach ,",
    "the cooling of the bec is accomplished by the non - condensate interaction with a thermal environment . in typical bec experiments ,",
    "the cooling is accomplished with evaporative techniques . however , in the experiments by reppy and co - workers @xcite , the bec was cooled by a thermal reservoir associated with the vycor glass host  exactly the situation we presently consider .",
    "the master equation takes a given bath model for the calculation , so one natural question is if a different bath model alters the physics of the bec statistics .",
    "while different models will certainly alter the dynamics of the condensation , we expect the statistics to be robust , just as the analogous partition function is",
    ".    how does all of this relate to traditional statistical physics , in particular the microcanonical , canonical , and grand canonical formalism ? recall that einstein predicted bec by analyzing the grand canonical formula @xcite . both grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble approaches describe the occurrence of bec equally well in the dramatic rise of the mean condensate number @xmath4 in the ground state .",
    "however , near the critical temperature and below , the grand canonical approach gives grossly different results for the variance and higher moments , the so - called `` grand canonical catastrophe '' illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cond]b .",
    "the question of fluctuations in bose - einstein condensation has attracted renewed interest .",
    "grossmann and holthaus @xcite previously obtained an analytical expression for the mean condensate particle number in a harmonic trap for finite @xmath0 using the grand canonical approach .",
    "however , their analytical expression does not show a smooth crossover near @xmath5 .",
    "grossmann and holthaus @xcite and ketterle and druten @xcite found the crossover behavior only by numerical solution of the equation for the condensate particle number .",
    "politzer also obtains an approximate expression for the variance in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to report advances on several fronts .",
    "one goal is to connect the master equation formalism with the partition function analysis in thermal equilibrium . to this end",
    ", we review the master equation formalism , and derive an approximate result for the mean condensate particle number , that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "this result is then connected with standard statistical mechanics by extending the grand canonical approach ( applied to the canonical ensemble problem ! ) to obtain an approximate result for the mean condensate particle number that is quite accurate through the critical temperature .",
    "this is done by deriving a self - consistent equation for the condensate particle number by eliminating the chemical potential",
    ". the equation may be approximately solved , and the solution exactly coincides with the approximate master equation result .",
    "next , we investigate fluctuations , a more subtle problem . the analogous treatment for the variance via the generalized grand canonical analysis works quite well for low temperatures , but fails for temperatures near or greater than the critical temperature . in order to obtain a more accurate analytic result from the master equation approach , we first reformulated the master equation as a stochastic path integral .",
    "the stochastic path integral formalism @xcite allows for an accurate approximation of all cumulants of the fluctuation statistics in terms of elementary functions , by applying the saddle - point approximation , whose large parameter is the number of condensed atoms .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the results , and present the fluctuation statistics of a general boson master equation , with arbitrary heating and cooling coefficients .",
    "finally , by combining the master equation / stochastic path integral predictions with the previous results of v. v. kocharovsky _",
    "based on canonical ensemble quasiparticle formalism @xcite ( hereafter referred to as cnb3 ) , which is very accurate at low temperature , we are able to formulate a hybrid theory , whose results are in near - perfect agreement with exact numerical simulation . the idea is to use the low-@xmath6 results of cnb3 to fix the values of three master equation parameters via the first three moments",
