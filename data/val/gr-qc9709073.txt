    "we shall describe a series of numerical studies of the nature of singularities in cosmological models . since the interiors of black holes can be described locally as cosmological models , it is possible that our methods and results may be useful to the participants in this conference .",
    "the generic singularity in spatially homogeneous cosmologies is reasonably well understood .",
    "the approach to it asymptotically falls into two classes .",
    "the first , called asymptotically velocity term dominated ( avtd ) @xcite , refers to a cosmology that approaches the kasner ( vacuum , bianchi i ) solution @xcite as @xmath0 .",
    "( spatially homogeneous universes can be described as a sequence of homogeneous spaces labeled by @xmath1 .",
    "here we shall choose @xmath1 so that @xmath2 coincides with the singularity . )",
    "an example of such a solution is the vacuum bianchi ii model @xcite which begins with a fixed set of kasner - like anisotropic expansion rates , and , possibly , makes one change of the rates in a prescribed way ( mixmaster - like bounce ) and then continues to @xmath2 as a fixed kasner solution .",
    "in contrast are the homogeneous cosmologies which display mixmaster dynamics such as vacuum bianchi viii and ix @xcite and bianchi vi@xmath3 and bianchi i with a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "jantzen @xcite has discussed other examples .",
    "mixmaster dynamics describes an approach to the singularity which is a sequence of kasner epochs with a prescription , originally due to belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite , for relating one kasner epoch to the next .",
    "some of the mixmaster bounces ( era changes ) display sensitivity to initial conditions one usually associates with chaos and in fact mixmaster dynamics is chaotic @xcite .",
    "the vacuum bianchi i ( kasner ) solution is distinguished from the other bianchi types in that the spatial scalar curvature @xmath4 , ( proporional to ) the minisuperspace ( mss ) potential @xcite , vanishes identically . but",
    "@xmath4 arises in other bianchi types due to spatial dependence of the metric in a coordinate basis .",
    "thus an avtd singularity is also characterized as a regime in which terms containing or arising from spatial derivatives no longer influence the dynamics .",
    "this means that the mixmaster models do not have an avtd singularity since the influence of the spatial derivatives ( through the mss potential ) never disappears ",
    "there is no last bounce .    in the late 1960 s ,",
    "bkl claimed to show that singularities in generic solutions to einstein s equations are locally of the mixmaster type @xcite .",
    "this means that each point of a spatially inhomogeneous universe could collapse to the singularity as the mixmaster sequence of kasner models .",
    "( it has been argued that this could generate a fractal spatial structure @xcite . ) in contrast , each point of a cosmology with an avtd singularity evolves asymptotically as a fixed kasner model .",
    "although the bkl result is controversial @xcite , it provides a hypothesis for testing .",
    "our ultimate objective is to test the bkl conjecture numerically .",
    "the work reported here was performed by using symplectic ode and pde solvers @xcite .",
    "while other numerical methods may be used to solve einstein s equations for the models discussed here , symplectic methods have proved extremely advantageous for mixmaster models and have also worked quite well in the gowdy plane symmetric and polarized @xmath5 symmetric cosmologies @xcite .",
    "consider a system with one degree of freedom described by @xmath6 and its canonically conjugate momentum @xmath7 with a hamiltonian @xmath8 note that the subhamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath10 separately yield equations of motion which are exactly solvable no matter the form of @xmath11 .",
    "variation of @xmath9 yields @xmath12 , @xmath13 with solution @xmath14 variation of @xmath10 yields @xmath15 , @xmath16 with solution @xmath17 note that the absence of momenta in @xmath10 makes ( [ ber - hvsoln ] ) exact for any @xmath18 .",
    "one can then demonstrate that to evolve from @xmath19 to @xmath20 an evolution operator @xmath21 can be constructed from the evolution sub - operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 obtained from ( [ ber - hksoln ] ) and ( [ ber - hvsoln ] ) .",
    "one can show that @xcite @xmath24 reproduces the true evolution operator through order @xmath25 .",
    "suzuki has developed a prescription to represent the full evolution operator to arbitrary order @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath26\\,{\\cal u}_{(2)}(s\\delta t)\\ ] ] where @xmath27 . the advantage of suzuki s approach is that one only needs to construct @xmath28 explicitly .",
    "@xmath29 is then constructed from appropriate combinations of @xmath30 .",
    "the generalization of this method to @xmath31 degrees of freedom and to fields is straightforward . in the latter case , @xmath32 \\to v[\\vec q(\\vec x , t)]$ ] so that @xmath33 becomes the functional derivative @xmath34 . on the computational spatial lattice ,",
    "the derivatives that are obtained in the expression for the functional derivative must be represented in differenced form .",
    "we note that , to preserve @xmath35th order accuracy in time , @xmath35th order accurate spatial differencing is required .",
    "some discussion of this has been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "( diagonal ) bianchi class a cosmologies @xcite are described by the metric @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 defines the bianchi type and @xmath19 is the bkl time coordinate .",
    "einstein s equations can be obtained by variation of the hamiltonian @xmath39 the logarithmic anisotropic scale factors @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are given in terms of the logarithmic volume @xmath43 and anisotropic shears @xmath44 as @xmath45 the momenta @xmath46 , @xmath47 are canonically conjugate to @xmath43 , @xmath44 respectively .",

    "when the potential itself is small ( @xmath61 ) , ( [ ber - h0homog ] ) describes a `` free particle '' in mss and is in fact approximately the kasner solution .    the standard algorithms for solving ode s @xcite often employ an adaptive time step .",
    "the idea is to take large time steps where nothing much happens ( e.g. in the kasner regime ) while taking shorter time steps when the forces are large ( e.g. at a bounce ) .",
    "unfortunately , in mixmaster dynamics , the duration of the kasner epochs increases exponentially in @xmath1 as @xmath62 @xcite while the duration of the bounce itself is in some sense fixed @xcite .",
    "this means that , although huge time steps may be taken in the kasner segments , the time step must become very small at the bounces .",
    "ideally , one would like the time step also to grow exponentially but this can not be done with standard approaches . thus , with a great deal of effort , standard methods can yield about 30 bounces for @xmath63 in about an hour on a supercomputer .",
    "the application of the symplectic method to mixmaster dynamics is straightforward . from ( [ ber - h0homog ] )",
    ", we have @xmath64 with an adaptive step size and a 6th order version of ( [ ber-4thorderu ] ) , one can do slightly better ( approximately a factor of three fewer steps ) than 4th order runge - kutta .",
    "however , it is well known that a bounce off an exponential wall ",
    "the bianchi ii ( or taub @xcite ) cosmology  is exactly solvable .",
    "if we first identify the dominant exponential wall ( say @xmath65 ) , then we find that the symplectic algorithm works for a different split of the hamiltonian into two subhamiltonians @xcite .",
    "let @xmath66 where ( e.g. for bianchi ix ) @xmath67 variation of @xmath68 is exactly solvable as before , while variation of @xmath69 yields equations with solution @xmath70 \\quad ; \\quad 6 p_\\alpha = { { d \\alpha } \\over { dt}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this new symplectic algorithm provides an enormous advantage because the bounce is built in .",
    "the time step can grow exponentially . in a few minutes on a desktop computer ,",
    "one can obtain , e.g. , 268 bounces for @xmath73 .",
    "[ ber - fig1 ] shows a comparison of the new and standard algorithms while fig .",
    "[ ber - fig2 ] shows a typical trajectory .",
    "since @xmath69 is actually the exact hamiltonian almost all the time , the accuracy of the method is much higher than the formal 6th order  we achieve machine precision .",
    "the bkl parameter @xmath74 characterizes the angle in the anisotropy plane of the kasner epoch trajectory . between the @xmath35th and @xmath75st kasner epochs",
    ", we have @xmath76 all numerical studies @xcite and a variety of analytic arguments @xcite have shown that one expects ( [ ber - umap ] ) to become ever more valid as @xmath0 . with our algorithm in a double or quadruple precision code , one can evolve until deviations from ( [ ber - umap ] ) disappear and then use the predicted values of @xmath74 as a test of the accuracy of the code .",
    "for example @xcite , one discovers that the hamiltonian constraint ( ( [ ber - h0homog ] ) with @xmath77 ) must be enforced although not necessarily at every time step .    for our studies of",
    "spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies , it is important to keep in mind that    \\(1 ) between bounces mixmaster dynamics looks like the avtd kasner solution ;    \\(2 ) in a fixed time variable such as @xmath1 , the time between bounces increases exponentially as @xmath62 ;    \\(3 ) extraordinary accuracy can be achieved by symplectic methods when one of the subhamiltonians is dominant ;    \\(4 ) enormous gains in accuracy and computational speed can be made by using a `` custom - designed '' treatment of the bounce .",
