    "it is known that dynamical decoupling@xcite is one of the essential control tools in fighting the decoherence of an open quantum system . in recent years",
    "many methods have been developed to design the decoupling pulses .",
    "those methods are based on the group structure or the geometric perspective of the system environment interaction @xcite .",
    "the effect of a general environment , however , is usually neglected .",
    "dynamical decoupling can be divided into several categories .",
    "it can be deterministic and periodic@xcite , deterministic and concatenated@xcite , or random@xcite .",
    "the strength of the pulses can be unbounded , which is usually termed bang - bang decoupling , or bounded @xcite .",
    "bounded control uses more realistic control resources and is more tolerant against implementation errors .",
    "both unbounded and bounded control attain the desired decoupling in the ideal limit where the period of a single decoupling cycle approaches zero . in practice , however , the duration of the cycle is finite and there will always be residual decoherence . to the best of our knowledge",
    "it is difficult to calculate the exact residual decoherence , especially when the effect of a general environment are taken into account . for",
    "a general configuration the amount of residual decoherence might depend on the shape of the decoupling pulses as well as the spectral density of the environment .",
    "for example , it has been argued that the bang - bang decoupling might be more efficient when the environment is characterized by the @xmath0 noise in stead of an ohmic bosonic environment@xcite .",
    "recently the effect of a general environment is studied , but only unbounded control are investigated@xcite . in other words , a comprehensive study of",
    "the residual decoherence of a system , which is coupled to a general environment and to which a general dynamical decoupling is applied , is still missing .",
    "this is mostly due to the lack of a convenient tool .",
    "an unified framework to investigate these effects is thus much needed .",
    "in this work we develop an unified numerical framework to simulate the renormalization of non - markovian dynamics of a system to which decoupling pulses are applied .",
    "it is capable of handling both unbounded and bounded pulses .",
    "it is also able to capture the effect of a general environment .",
    "such a framework can help us to study the efficiency of a prescribed decoupling pulse in realistic situations .",
    "it might also open new avenues to optimize the decoupling pulses . to see what are the necessary ingredients of such a framework , recall that a quantum system without decoherence obeys schrdinger equation , resulting a coherent , hence non - markovian , dynamics . on the other hand , long time dynamics of an open quantum system in high temperature regime",
    "is typically markovian@xcite .",
    "a successful decoherence control should renormalize the dynamics , moving the system dynamics away from markovian regime and move it into the non - markovian regime .",
    "the residual decoherence , however , prevent us from simply using the schrdinger equation to describe the renormalized dynamics .",
    "it is thus essential that such a framework can describe both the markovian and non - markovian dynamics for an open quantum system coupled to a general environment .",
    "also , for numerical purpose a nonconvoluted master equation is highly desirable comparing to an integral - differential equation .",
    "the nonconvoluted non - markovian master equation @xcite derived from the non - markovian quantum trajectories @xcite formalism naturally provides such a framework .",
    "markovian dynamics and schrdinger dynamics can be seen as two limiting cases of the formalism .",
    "the formalism has been used to study the decoherence of the open quantum system in the non - markovian regime @xcite as well as the non - markovian dynamics of a two - level atom immersed in a photonic band - gap material@xcite . in some cases the stochastic non - markovian quantum trajectories",
    "can be formally averaged , resulting an exact non - markovian master equation .",
    "in general , when the decoupling are applied to the system , an exact non - markovian master equation can not be formed@xcite .",
    "but an approximated master equation can always be derived in the nearly markovian limit@xcite or weak coupling limit@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the resulting non - markovian master equation is valid in a wide range of parameter regime@xcite .",
    "it is this nonconvoluted master equation that will be taken as the starting point of our investigation of the renormalization of the non - markovian dynamics .",
    "the organization of the manuscript is as follows . in section [ sec : nm ] we briefly review the non - markovian quantum trajectory formalism and the resulting non - markovian master equation . in section",
    "[ sec : dd ] we derive the non - markovian master equations when the decoupling pulses are applied . in section [ sec : ou ] we simulate the renormalized dynamics after decoupling of a system which is driven by the ornstein - uhlenbech noise while in section [ sec : sb ] we study the renormalized dynamics of the spin - boson model .",

    "in summary we have developed a numerical framework to investigate the renormalization of the non - markovian dynamics due to the dynamical decoupling pulses . the nonconvoluted non - markovian master equation used in this work",
    "is derived from the non - markovian quantum trajectories formalism .",
    "the resulting master equation is written in a convenient form such that once the decoupling pulses are prescribed , the renormalized dynamic can be readily simulated . in order to validate the framework we have performed a comprehensive simulation of the renormalized dynamics under following scenarios .",
    "we have investigated two different system - environment interactions , namely @xmath54 and @xmath85 .",
    "three representative environmental spectral densities are used , including supra - ohmic , ohmic , and sub - ohmic environment .",
    "two kinds of decoupling pulses are considered .",
    "one is the typical bang - bang decoupling while the other one is the continuous decoupling .",
    "note also that the period of the decoupling cycle , @xmath40 , is finite in all of the simulations .",
    "the numerical results presented in section [ sec : ou ] and [ sec : sb ] clearly demonstrate that the framework is capable of simulate the renormalization of the dynamics of a system coupled to a general environment under the action of a general decoupling pulse .",
    "the renormalized dynamics , in turn , determined the true efficiency of a decoupling pulse .",
    "we observe that different decoupling pulses sometimes give rise to qualitatively different renormalized dynamics , and the difference depends on both the system - environment interaction and the environmental correlation function .",
    "recall that , however , these decoupling pulses are designed solely based on the form of the system - environment interaction , and they all attain the desired decoupling in the ideal limit . to better understand the implication of this observation one should notice that bang - bang decoupling can be viewed as an unphysical limit of the continuous decoupling@xcite . within the framework presented in this work , bang - bang decoupling simply corresponds to a very special envelop function . on the other hand , only one particular",
    "envelop function @xmath75 is used for continuous decoupling in this work . in other words ,",
    "two special envelope function are chosen to carry out the simulations throughout this work . in reality",
    "the real envelop function of the pulse , which might be designed based on other methods , should fall somewhere in between these two limiting cases .",
    "the profound difference in the renormalized dynamics observed in this work thus indicates that the real efficiency depends crucially on the actual shape of the envelop function , the spectral density of the environment , and the nature of the system - environment interaction .",
    "for example , our results show that continuous decoupling is more advantageous in many cases , as can be seem in fig.[fig : ou ] , fig.[fig : sbp ] , fig.[fig : sbszcdd ] , and fig.[fig : sz1f ] .",
    "however when @xmath85 the continuous decoupling will induce mixing between the real and imaginary part of the environment correlation function , making the decoupling less efficient . above observation actually leads to the possibility of further optimizing the decoupling pulses basing on the master equation eq ( [ eq : nm_me_1 ] ) and using techniques such as pulse shaping@xcite .",
    "the framework developed here can server multiple purposes .",
    "the primary goal is to server as a convenient tool in investigating the efficiency of a prescribed decoupling pulse .",
    "although we have only shown the cases where the deterministic , periodic pulses are applied .",
    "the framework can also easily simulate the renormalized dynamics induced by a random decoupling @xcite or a concatenated dynamical decoupling@xcite .",
    "it can also be used as an alternative starting point to design the decoupling pulse .",
    "one can naturally view the non - markovian master equation under decoupling as a dynamical map , whose convergence the ideal fixed point of zero system - environment interaction can be studied .",
    "the framework is not limited to a single two - level system coupled to a general environment .",
    "it is also suitable for studying the renormalized dynamics of a multi - level system .",
    "such a multi - level system can represent a multi physical or logical qubit system .",
    "when necessary , one can unravel the master equation and use the corresponding stochastic schrdinger equation , which is numerically advantageous for a large system .",
    "it is also important to note that if eventually a continuous measurement interpretation of non - markovian stochastic equations is developed , this framework can be adapted to study the error correction and feedback control in the non - markovian regime ."
