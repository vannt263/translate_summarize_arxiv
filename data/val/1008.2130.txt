    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are characterized by short pulse periods ( @xmath4 ) , low spin - down rates ( @xmath5 ) , old characteristic ages ( @xmath6 ) , and weak surface magnetic fields ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . about @xmath8 of the msps",
    "are in binaries , but only @xmath9 of the total pulsars @xcite .",
    "standard models proposed that msps are formed in neutron star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , in which the ns has accreted the mass and angular momentum from its companion , and been spun up to a short spin period @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , mass accretion onto the ns induces its initial magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) to decline to @xmath11 . when the mass transfer ceases , a binary millisecond pulsar ( bmsp ) is formed .",
    "however , the origin of the msps still presents some controversial puzzles .",
    "firstly , can the known ns lmxbs evolve into the observed msps both in the galactic disk @xcite ?",
    "statistical analysises show that the birthrate of lmxbs is @xmath12 order of magnitudes lower than that of msps @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is hard to understand how isolated msps in the galactic disk were formed via the standard recycling scenario .",
    "although evaporation of the donor stars by the high energy radiation of the msps might account for the origin of the isolated msps , the observed time scales for evaporating a companion star seem too long .",
    "thirdly , in standard model the strong tidal effects operating in the binary during the mass transfer serves to circularize the orbit .",
    "however , the discovery of the eccentric ( @xmath13 ) bmsp psr j1903 + 0327 in the galactic plane has challenged the standard scenario @xcite .    as an alternative evolutionary channel ,",
    "bmsp may originate from the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of an accreting white dwarf ( wd ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that aic may occur by thermal time - scale mass transfer in such binaries with orbital periods of a few days .",
    "once the accreting one wd grows to the chandrasekhar limit , the electron capture process may induce gravitational collapse rather than type ia supernova . as a result of angular momentum conservation and magnetic flux conservation ,",
    "an msp with rapid spin and low magnetic field may be produced . to account for its observed characteristics ,",
    "the bursting pulsar gro j1744 - 28 was suggested to be originated from the aic of a massive one wd @xcite .",
    "recently , the estimated birthrates of msps by population synthesis calculations show that the often - neglected aic channel can not be ignored @xcite",
    ".    in the aic channel the puzzles in the standard recycling model mentioned above might disappear .",
    "firstly , the aic of accreting wds has been raised to interpret the birthrate discrepancy @xcite , and the aic process may be associated with the @xmath14-process nucleosynthesis of heavy ( baryon number @xmath15 ) nuclei @xcite .",
    "secondly , a kick velocity caused by asymmetric collapse may be produced during aic of wds .",
    "an appropriate kick can disrupt the binary system , and results in the birth of isolated msps .",
    "otherwise , the binary survives and an eccentric bmsp is formed .",
    "@xcite argued that the aic channel can form bmsps of all of the observed types .",
    "@xcite proposed that the aic of a massive and rapidly rotating wd could produce the observed orbital parameters of psr j1903 + 0327 .",
    "in this work , employing the binary population synthesis approach we attempt to investigate if the aic evolutionary channel can produce a population of eccentric bmsps , as well as isolated msps . in section 2 , we describe the population synthesis approach and the evolution model of msps .",
    "the simulated results by population synthesis are given in section 3 .",
    "finally , we present a brief discussion and summary in section 4 .",
    "using an evolutionary population synthesis based on the rapid binary star evolution ( bse ) code ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we attempt to study the statistical properties ( such as the birth rate , total number , the distributions of orbital period and eccentricity ) of msps formed via the aic process of a massive one wd in the galaxy . in calculation",
    ", we consider the evolution of single stars with binary - star interactions , which includes the mass transfer and accretion via stellar winds and roche lobe overflow , common envelope ( ce ) evolution , supernovae and aic kick , tidal friction , and orbital angular momentum loss containing gravitational wave radiation and magnetic braking .",
    "all stars are assumed to born in binary systems , and start with zero eccentricities and a solar metallicity ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we adopt the following input parameters for the simulation .",
    "( 1 ) a constant star formation rate @xmath17 , which corresponds to that one binary with @xmath18 is born in the galaxy per year ; ( 2 ) the primary mass distribution @xmath19 , in which the initial mass function @xmath20 is given by @xcite ; ( 3 ) the secondary mass distribution @xmath21 , which corresponds to a uniform distribution of the mass ratio @xmath22 ; ( 4 ) a uniform distribution of @xmath23 for the binary separation @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 ( normalization results in @xmath26 ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the input parameter space for the primary mass @xmath27 , the secondary mass @xmath28 , and the separation",
    "@xmath24 are set to be @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively . for each initial parameters @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , and @xmath24 ) ,",
    "we set @xmath34 grid points in logarithmically space , so and have @xmath35 during the evolution , if a binary appears as bmsp , it makes a contribution to the birthrate as @xmath36 if this system lives for a time @xmath37 as a member of bmsps , it makes a contribution to the number @xmath38    during the ce evolution , the parameter @xmath39 describes the efficiency that the orbital energy is transferred to expel the envelope @xcite , here @xmath40 is the total binding energy of the envelope , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the final and the initial orbital energy of the cores , respectively .",
    "there exist some diversity in calculating the initial orbital energy , hence @xcite suggest that in this formulation @xmath43 should be consistent with @xmath44 adopted by @xcite . both the estimated velocity of individual pulsars and the pulsar velocity distribution indicate that the nascent nss should have received a kick velocity , which may root in the asymmetric collapse of massive progenitors of nss @xcite .",
    "the kick plays an important role in determining the fate of binaries , whether surviving or disruptive .",
    "noticeably , it is widely accepted that the ns formed by the aic may receive a lower kick velocity ( e.g. @xmath45 in the standard model of hurley et al .",
    "however , some works presented the opposite point of view @xcite ( see section 4 ) . in our standard model , a relatively stronger kick dispersion for nss by core collapse supernovae is taken to be @xmath46 @xcite , @xcite . ] while @xmath47 ( a ultra - high kick diepersion ) for nss via the aic . to study the influence of aic kick on the formation of msps , other kick dispersion such as @xmath48 are also included .",
    "unless we particularly mention , the bse input parameters in table 3 of @xcite are used .      when the mass of the accreting wd reaches the chandrasekhar limit , the process of electron capture may dominate , and induce the wd to collapse to be an ns or explode as a type ia supernova @xcite , depending on the wd mass and the accretion rate",
    ". @xcite pointed out that , if the accretion rate @xmath49 , an one wd with an initial mass of @xmath50 is very likely to collapse to be an ns rather than experience type ia supernova explosion . by 2.5-dimensional radiation - hydrodynamics simulations of the aic of wds",
    ", @xcite proposed that the spin period of the natal nss are 2.2 - 6.3 ms .",
    "therefore , in our calculations all nss formed by aic are assumed to be rapidly rotating objects with millisecond period , and low magnetic field . in the input parameters , the initial magnetic field strengths of the msp are chosen from a lognormal distribution of mean 9 and standard deviation 0.4 , and its initial spin periods @xmath51 are distributed uniformly between 1 and 10 ms . if the donor star fills its roche lobe after the aic , the ns should appear as an x - ray pulsar @xcite , and radio emission is suppressed .",
    "however , even if for a detached binary with a he star or a massive companion , accretion may occur due to capture of the stellar winds , which may strongly influence the radio emission of msps . based on the simplified version of the theoretical model given by @xcite",
    ", we consider the msp s spin evolution as follows .",
    "\\(i ) radio pulsar phase : after the msp birth via aic , it appears as a radio pulsar due to the rapid rotation , which causes its radiation to be strong enough to expel the winds coming from the he star beyond the radius of the light cylinder @xmath52 or the bondi accretion radius @xmath53@xcite . as a result of magnetic dipole radiation , the spin angular momentum loss rate of the msp is @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the angular velocity , and the magnetic dipole moment of the msp , respectively .    considering the interaction between the magnetic field of the msp and the wind material from the donor star",
    ", @xcite proposed that , if the spin period @xmath57 of the ns is greater than either @xmath58 or @xmath59 the radio phase stops . here",
    "@xmath60 is the rate of mass flow onto the ns , @xmath61is the wind velocity relative to the ns , and @xmath62 is the mass of the msp .    based on the criterion for the radio phase mentioned above , a ns formed via aic is assumed to be a msp until its spin period @xmath63 , or it crosses the so - called `` death line '' , i.e. @xmath64 @xcite , where @xmath65 is the surface magnetic field of the ns .",
    "\\(ii ) propeller phase : with the spin - down of the ns , the light cylinder move outwards , and the magnetosphere radius @xmath66 is less than @xmath52 , and is greater than the corotation radius @xmath67 . subjecting to the centrifugal barrier",
    ", the winds material is assumed to be ejected at @xmath68 , and exerting a propeller spin - down torque on the ns @xcite .",
    "the spin angular momentum loss rate via the propeller effect is given by @xmath69,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the keplerian angular velocity at @xmath68 .",

    "based on the theoretical model described in section 2 , we calculated the evolution of @xmath74 binaries to an age of 12 gyr using the bse code , as well as additions for msp evolution which will affect the lifetime , @xmath75 , used to calculate bmsp numbers ( see eq .   3 ) .",
    "to explore the effect of input parameters , we have calculated the evolutionary results for six models ( see table 1 ) , which is determined by the ce parameter @xmath76 , the kick dispersion @xmath72 of core collapse , and the kick dispersion @xmath73 via aic channel .",
    "we collect the evolutionary stages of msps as follows : ( 1 ) binary msps with a main sequence , red giant , or subgiant companion ( bmsp - mg ) ; ( 2 ) binary msps with a he star companion ( bmsp - he ) ; ( 3 ) isolated msps . in table 2",
    ", we summarize the predicted numbers and birthrates of various types of msps via aic channel in the galaxy .    to evaluate the uncertainties in the birthrates and numbers for various types of bmsps , in table 2 we also present the simulated results for same model under different random number seeds and grid points @xmath34 .",
    "we find that , the predicted numbers have considerable uncertainties , especially the numbers of bmsp - he in models d and f for different random number seeds , as well as the numbers of bmsp - mg in models a , c , and e for different grid points .",
    "however , the birthrates besides bmsp - mg show only small variations ( with uncertainties @xmath77 ) . the uncertainties in the numbers seem to originate from various random number sequences under different seeds or grid points .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "firstly , the random number sequence can influence the kick received by the natal msp , which can affect the evolutionary fate of binaries .",
    "secondly , the spin evolution of msps is related to the distribution of the initial period and magnetic field .",
    "both parameters strongly depend on the random number sequence , which can result in the different evolutionary histories of msps ( see eq .  3 ) .    in model",
    "a , we take a strong kick of @xmath78 for the aic channel , and @xmath79 .",
    "our results show that there exist @xmath80 bmsps , which formed via aic channel . in our standard model ,",
    "bmsps with a he star companion have a number that is @xmath81 times higher than that with a main sequence , red giant , or subgiant companion , and the birthrate also shows the same tendency .",
    "in addition , the aic channel can result in the formation of @xmath82 isolated msps , which is compatible with the estimation by observations @xcite . as a result of large kick , @xmath83 bmsps with an eccentric orbit ( @xmath84 ) is produced .",
    "the results of model b show that , for the same kick , a lower @xmath71 results in fewer bmsps .",
    "other models also have the same tendency .",
    "this difference originates from the influence of @xmath71 on the evolution of close binaries .",
    "a high @xmath71 can prevent coalescence during the ce stage , significantly increasing the formation rate of bmsps @xcite . in model e and f ,",
    "we take a low kick for aic channel , and find that more bmsps are produced , whereas almost no eccentric bmsps are formed .",
    "in addition , most models predict that the number of bmsps with a rg , or sg companion ( no bmsps with ms donor star ) is less than 10 ( besides model a , c , and e when @xmath85 ) , and their eccentricities close to 0 .        in figure 1 , we plot the distribution of bmsp - he binaries in the @xmath86 diagram for models a , b , and c under seed 1 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is seen that in model b most bmsp - he binaries are in tight orbits ( @xmath88 ) with eccentricities @xmath89 . for models a and c",
    ", the binary population seems to be distributed into two regions .",
    "similar to model b , the first group have a short orbital period of @xmath90 and a large eccentricities of @xmath91 . while contrary to the first group , the second are consists of bmsps with a long orbital period of @xmath92 and an eccentricities near 0 .        the distribution of the primordial binary systems forming bmsps in the @xmath93 ( left ) and @xmath94 ( right ) diagrams are shown in figure 2 for models a , and e. one can see that the parameter space of the primordial binaries forming bmsp - he is wider than that of bmsp - mg , and the latter has the rigorous initial parameters . in addition , the initial parameter space of bmsp - he in model a is larger than that in model e , while the tendency is reversed for bmsp - mg .",
    "this difference results from the various effects of the kicks on bmsp - he and bmsp - mg .",
    "the former usually has a narrow orbit , and high kick can prevent the merger of two components .",
    "however , for bmsp - mg with a wide orbit high kick can lead to more binaries to be broken up during the aic .",
    "the difference in the initial parameter space naturally account for the difference of birthrates .",
    "bmsps with a long orbital period ( @xmath92 ) have evolved from primordial binaries with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",

    "the main goal of this work is to explore if the aic channel can form a population of eccentric bmsps . for a massive one wd that accretes material from its donor star , when its mass reaches chandrasekhar limit ,",
    "the process of electron capture may induce gravitational collapse of the wd rather than a type ia supernova explosion . as a result of aic , an msp with a weak surface magnetic field , and low spin - down rate may be formed .",
    "same as the formation of those nss originated from the collapse of massive star , the nascent nss via aic may also receive a kick due to the asymmetric ejection of material or neutrinos from the newborn nss .",
    "our simulated results can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 . for a high kick velocity ( @xmath147 ) during the aic , there exist @xmath148 ( @xmath79 ) or @xmath149 ( @xmath44 ) eccentric bmsps in the galaxy , accompanied by a he star",
    ". however , almost all bmsps are in circular orbits when the natal kick velocity @xmath150 .",
    "the one wd + he star channel play an important role in forming bmsps . except for model d , our predicted number and birthrate of bmsp -",
    "he are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of bmsp - mg .",
    "in fact , this evolutionary channel has been noticed by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the evolutionary channel of co wd + he star to type ia supernovae , and found that this channel can interpret type ia supernovae with short delay times .",
    "it is difficult for the aic channel to produce bmsps with a ms , rg , or sg companion , the number of which is less than 10 , and their eccentricities are near 0 . if the companion of psr j1903 + 0327 is really a ms star , the probability that it originated from the current binary can be ruled out . both the recycled model and the aic channel can not produce this peculiar bmsp with a high eccentricity and a ms donor star , unless the natal ns had possessed a debris disk @xcite .",
    "we expect further detailed multi - waveband observations for psr j1903 + 0327 to constrain the properties of its optical counterpart , and hence its formation channel .",
    "all the models can produce @xmath151 isolated msps in the galaxy , without invoking the evaporation of donor stars by the high energy radiation of the msps @xcite .",
    "in addition , aic of wds may form sub - millisecond pulsars in a quark star regime @xcite , which can hardly be formed in the scenario of normal nss . in particular , the aic channel seems to be related to the discrepancy between the birthrates of msps and lmxbs , the solution of which may need additional mechanisms forming msps @xcite .",
    "certainly , it is interesting to investigate further in this alternative model .",
    "we note that the predicted numbers of various types of bmsps have considerable uncertainties for different random number sequences . however , the birthrates and the numbers for bmsp - he in a given model show little or no variation . since bmsp",
    "- he make a significant contribution to the total numbers of bmsps , our results are reliable in this respect .",
    "perhaps the biggest uncertainty in this work is the kick distribution during the aic .",
    "it strongly depend on the kick velocity if the aic channel can form the eccentric bmsps .",
    "it is usually assumed that the natal ns formed by aic may receive a small kick @xcite .",
    "therefore , the possibility forming the eccentric bmsps via the aic channel can be ruled out .",
    "in addition , even if the natal ns receives a strong kick , mass in the form of neutrinos @xcite . if the ejection of neutrinos is highly asymmetric , a large kick may be produced .",
    "alternatively , during aic a large amount of mass ejection may occur as a result of formation of a low mass bare strange star @xcite , and a large kick velocity may be received . ]",
    "aic channel can also not produce the eccentric bmsps with an orbital period of @xmath152 days , and their companions are he stars .",
    "based on the results by binary population synthesis , we demonstrate that the observed orbital parameters of psr j1903 + 0327 can not be produced by the aic channel .",

    "<S> binary radio pulsars are generally believed to have been spun up to millisecond periods ( i.e. recycling ) via mass accretion from their donor stars , and they are the descendants of neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> however , some studies indicate that the formation of pulsars from the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of accreting white dwarfs ( wds ) can not be excluded . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we use a population synthesis code to examine if the aic channel can produce eccentric binary millisecond pulsars ( bmsps ) in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our simulated results indicate that , only when the natal msps receive a relatively strong kick ( @xmath0 ) , can the aic channel produce @xmath1 eccentric ( @xmath2 ) bmsps in the galaxy , most of which are accompanied by a helium star . such a kick seems to be highly unlikely in the conventional aic process , hence the probability of forming eccentric bmsps via the aic channel can be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> even if a high kick is allowed , the aic channel can not produce eccentric bmsps with an orbital period of @xmath3 days . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we propose that the peculiar bmsp psr j1903 + 0327 can not be formed by the aic channel </S>",
    "<S> . however , the aic evolutionary channel may produce some fraction of isolated millisecond pulsars , and even sub - millisecond pulsars if they really exist .    </S>",
