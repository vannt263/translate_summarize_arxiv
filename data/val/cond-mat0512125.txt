    "the formation of clusters and deposits by irreversible aggregation of particles is an example of a nonequilibrium growth process .",
    "although several mechanisms can be involved in these processes , the most simple models only take into account the effects of thermal diffusion . among these models , the dla ( diffusion limited aggregation ) @xcite and dld ( diffusion limited deposition ) @xcite have been widely used . in dla , particles are released one by one at a distance @xmath3 from a seed particle , and perform a random - walk in a @xmath4-dimensional space .",
    "eventually , the random walker either reaches the aggregate and attaches to it , or moves sufficiently far away from the aggregate to be removed .",
    "dld is a version of dla for the growth of deposits on fibers and surfaces .",
    "@xcite in dld , particles also diffuse randomly through a @xmath4-dimensional space , but attach either to a @xmath5 dimensional substrate or to the deposit . despite being based on a very simple algorithm , these models ( and modifications thereof )",
    "generate very complex patterns and have served as a guideline for the understanding of wide range of phenomena such as electrochemical deposition , viscous fingering , dendritic solidification , dielectric breakdown , etc .",
    "@xcite    at present , there is no theoretical framework to describe the scaling behavior of dla or dld structures .",
    "initially , it was assumed that the structure of the aggregates is homogeneous , statistically self - similar fractal and could be characterized by a fractal dimensionality @xmath6 .",
    "however , this simplified assumption does not fully capture the complexity of dla and dld structures and a better characterization is obtained from the studies of the growth probability distribution .",
    "one can then apply a multifractal scaling analysis to determine the multifractal spectrum of the growth measure , or equivalently an infinite hierarchy of fractal dimensions .",
    "@xcite the remarkable scaling behavior of the growth probabilities @xcite immediately raises the question of their behavior when mechanisms other than the thermal diffusion are included .",
    "it is well known that short - range isotropic interactions do not change the cluster s structure at large length scales . at small length scales , however , a short - range attraction ( repulsion ) promotes the formation of less dense ( more dense ) aggregates but with no change in the fractal dimensions @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite a different picture emerges when long - range , anisotropic interactions are considered .",
    "results for dla of dipolar particles for @xmath7 indicate that @xmath6 decreases from @xmath8 ( the value for pure dla @xcite ) to @xmath9 when the dipolar interaction is increased .",
    "@xcite this is in accordance with the results for cluster - cluster aggregation of dipolar particles @xcite as well as with experimental results for the aggregation of magnetic micro - spheres .",
    "@xcite    in our previous work @xcite we have grown two - dimensional dld clusters consisting of up to @xmath10 dipolar particles , and found evidences of a more complex behavior for the deposits structure .",
    "[ two_deposits ] shows two typical deposits obtained for weak and strong dipolar interactions .",
    "the deposits consist of many tree - like clusters competing to grow .",
    "as the deposition process continues fewer and fewer trees keep on growing",
    ". eventually only a single tree survives . in both cases the height and width of an individual tree of size @xmath11 ( number of particles in the cluster ) can be described by the power - laws @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "@xcite likewise , the average number @xmath14 of trees of a given size scales with @xmath11 as @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite two scaling regimes have been observed : ( i ) for @xmath11 less than the crossover size @xmath16 , the shape and the fractal dimension of the trees @xmath17 are temperature dependent in such a way that @xmath18 and @xmath17 decrease with increasing of the interaction strength .",
    "we call this scaling regime the _ dipolar regime_. ( ii ) for @xmath19 , and for large enough systems , pure dld values of the exponents are observed independently of the interaction strength .",
    "this implies a crossover to the diffusion - driven _",
    "dla scaling regime _",
    ", where the effects of the dipolar interactions are dominated by thermal effects . the dipolar regime corresponds to deposits exhibiting an orientational order of dipoles and the onset of the dla - regime coincides with the disappearance of the orientational order . @xcite more strikingly , it has been found that the value of @xmath6 ( the fractal dimension of the entire deposit ) barely varies with the dipole interaction strength . in the present paper , we will show further evidence of this by analyzing in detail the scaling behavior of the density and a lateral correlation function .        despite having the same fractal dimension , deposits obtained for different strengths of the dipolar interaction ( equivalently , different effective temperatures ) exhibit quite different structures .",
    "this situation resembles that of dla and percolating clusters in @xmath20 , namely they have the same fractal dimensions , although their geometrical structures are quite different .",
    "@xcite in this paper we characterize the deposits of dipoles further by testing a multifractal scaling of the growth probabilities @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the probability that the perimeter site @xmath23 is the next to be added to a cluster .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the model of dipolar dld and describe details of the simulations . in section [ subsec : paco ] ,",
    "the scaling exponents obtained for the density , lateral correlation function , the mean height of the upper surface and the interfacial width are compared with those of dld . in section [ subsec :",
    "mult ] we present the multifractal spectra calculated for strong and weak dipolar interactions , and for several stages of growth .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our findings .",
    "the model and the simulation technique are the same as in our previous works @xcite ; we briefly outline them here , and describe simulation details which allowed us to grow relatively large clusters .",
    "the simulations are performed on a two - dimensional square - lattice with lattice spacing @xmath24 and width @xmath25 .",
    "the adsorbing substrate corresponds to the bottom row ( @xmath26 ) and periodic boundary conditions are applied in the direction parallel to the substrate ( @xmath27-direction ) .",
    "particles carry a three - dimensional dipole moment of strength @xmath28 and interact with other particles through the dipolar pair - potential @xmath29 : @xmath30 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a two - dimensional vector and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are three - dimensional unit vectors in the direction of the dipole moments of particles 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "initially , a particle with random dipolar moment is introduced at the lattice site @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a random integer in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 is the maximum height of the deposit and @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "the particle then diffuses by a series of jumps to nearest - neighbor lattice sites , while interacting with the particles that are already part of the deposit .",
    "eventually , the particle either contacts the deposit ( i.e. , becomes a nearest - neighbor of another particle that belongs to the deposit ) , or attaches to the substrate ( i.e. , reaches the bottom of the simulation box ) , or moves away from the substrate . in the latter case",
    ", the particle is removed when it reaches a distance from the substrate larger than @xmath41 , and a new one is introduced .",
    "once the particle attaches to the substrate or to the deposit , its dipole relaxes along the direction of the local field created by all other particles in the deposit . in all simulations reported here",
    "we take @xmath42 ; larger values of @xmath40 have also been tested and found to give the same results , but with drastically increased computational times .",
    "the effect of the dipolar interaction on the random walk is incorporated through a metropolis algorithm .",
    "the interaction energy of an incoming particle with the deposit is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the particle s position , @xmath45 is the orientation of its dipole moment and @xmath46 is the number of particles in the deposit . to simplify the notation ,",
    "the sum over the periodic replicas of the system is omitted in the last expression . to move the particle",
    ", we select a neighboring site @xmath47 and a new dipole orientation @xmath48 randomly .",
    "this displacement is accepted with probability @xmath49\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is an effective temperature inversely proportional to dipolar energy scale . in the limit @xmath51 ,",
    "only displacements which lower the energy @xmath52 are accepted . on the other extreme , for @xmath53 ,",
    "all displacements are accepted and our model reduces to dld .    one can estimate the number of calculations of @xmath29 , @xmath54 , necessary to grow a deposit of mass @xmath46 on a strip of width @xmath55 in the following way .",
    "since each incoming particle starts its movement at a distance of order @xmath55 from the deposit , it takes roughly @xmath56 steps to reach the deposit .",
    "if there are @xmath57 particles in the deposit , @xmath29 has to be calculated @xmath58 times .",
    "summing this factor over @xmath46 particles gives @xmath59 .",
    "since we have performed simulations for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , these values roughly give @xmath62 , which is about 3 to 4 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values of the largest systems simulated in an equilibrium run of two - dimensional dipolar fluids .",
    "@xcite therefore , to make simulations feasible we rewrite the expression for the incoming particle  deposit interaction energy in a different form . to this aim ,",
    "the dipolar pair potential @xmath29 , eq .  ( [ dipol_inter1 ] ) , is rewritten as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the dipolar field created by the particle @xmath23 at the site occupied by the particle @xmath65 @xmath66,\\ ] ] using eq .",
    "( [ dipol_inter2 ] ) one can write the interaction energy between the incoming particle ( which is at site @xmath67 and has a dipole orientation @xmath68 ) and a deposit formed by @xmath46 dipoles as @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( again , the sum over periodic replicas is omitted ) is the dipolar field created by the deposit at site @xmath67 . during simulations we store the dipolar field @xmath71 at site @xmath67 together with the size of the deposit @xmath72 for which the field @xmath73 is calculated .",
    "the particles in the deposit are ordered according to their arrival `` time '' .",
    "then , the interaction energy is rewritten in the form @xmath74 , which allows to reduce the number of calculations of the dipolar pair - potential from @xmath46 to @xmath75 . at the early stages of growth",
    "most of the lattice sites have not yet been visited by an incoming particle , hence @xmath76 . however , as the deposit grows the number of the lattice sites that have been visited more than once increases . moreover , due to the shadowing effect , the sites close to the tips of the trees become visited more frequently , and thus the overall computation time of the dipolar energies is decreased",
    ". we have performed tests to compare the computation times for calculating the energy between the two methods . for a system of width @xmath60 and @xmath77 particles ,",
    "the storage of the dipolar fields represents gains in computational time of about 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "finally , the long - range of the dipolar interaction is treated by the ewald sum method adapted to the slab geometry of the system .",
    "simulations were carried out using four temperatures , @xmath78 , and four system sizes , @xmath79 with 20 000 , 30 000 , 50 000 , and 100 000 particles per deposit , respectively .",
    "each choice of these parameters corresponds to one of the two regimes of growth .",
    "for instance , the dla regime is never observed for the lowest temperature @xmath80 , while for @xmath81 it is easily reached even for the smallest system size @xmath82 . as we mentioned above",
    ", our previous findings suggest that the fractal dimension of the deposits @xmath6 is the same as for dld even in the dipolar regime .",
    "@xcite to validate this picture , we next examine the scaling behavior of the following quantities : the density of the deposit and the lateral correlation function at a given height ; the mean height of the upper surface for a given number of particles ; the interfacial width at a given height .",
    "all of them are global quantities that characterize the entire deposit , and which do not show any qualitative or quantitative differences between the dipolar and the dla regimes .",
    "a typical plot of the mean density @xmath83 at a distance @xmath84 from the substrate has three regimes separated by two crossover heights , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( see fig .  [ densities ] ) . at early `` times '' the deposit builds up until it reaches a height @xmath85 .",
    "then , there appears a scaling regime during which the density decreases as a power of height , @xmath87 , the exponent @xmath88 being related to the fractal dimension @xmath6 of the deposit by @xmath89 .",
    "@xcite the density stops decreasing and saturates when the lateral correlation length @xmath90 reaches the size of the system @xmath55 . given that @xmath90 grows with height as @xmath91 , then @xmath92 , with @xmath93 .",

    "a linear regression between @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the largest system - size ( @xmath95 ) gives roughly the same scaling exponent @xmath102 , showing no systematic variation with temperature .",

    "in particular , the value of @xmath225 is the same for the biggest and the smallest deposits , ( @xmath228 ) and ( @xmath229 ) , what suggests that the maximum growth probability , within the considered range of @xmath46 , does not depend on @xmath46 . beyond the boundary value @xmath230",
    "there is clear mass dependence .",
    "finally , notice that @xmath189 flattens for larger values of @xmath176 .",

    "for the dla the maximum has been reported to be at the position @xmath232 , ref .  .",
    "with the monte - carlo technique we can not determine such small probabilities .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : mult2 ] demonstrates the convergence of @xmath189 towards the asymptotic behavior which is reached at @xmath239 .",
    "again , like in the case @xmath105 , a region of small @xmath176 s can be identified where the multifractal spectra does not depend on @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , in both regimes we obtain a value of @xmath240 , which is considerably lower than the corresponding value obtained for @xmath105 .",
    "the turning point separating @xmath46-dependent from @xmath46-independent behavior is located at @xmath241 . beyond this point good data collapse",

    "we shall see below how to amend this shortcoming .",
    "the changes in the shape of the @xmath177-spectrum as @xmath46 grows can be interpreted as an increase in the fractal dimension of the screened parts of the deposit , but for the studied range of @xmath176 s , @xmath177 still stays well below the @xmath105 curve . according to the picture developed in section [ subsec : paco ] , the maximum values of @xmath177 should equal @xmath242 .",
    "the figure suggests a further increase in @xmath177 if more probe particles are used to estimate the growth probabilities .",
    "although no conclusive statements can be made regarding this point , we shall see in the next subsection that it is expected that the large @xmath176 parts of the spectra shift upwards once corrections to scaling have been included .",
    "lastly , the elongated appearance of the trees in the dipolar regime resembles that observed in the initial stages of deposits grown at high temperatures in the dla regime .",
    "our data show , however , that the multifractal structure of the dipolar regime is clearly different from those of the initial stages of growth of deposits at higher temperatures , even if the fractal dimensions are similar .",

    "moreover , the subset satisfying @xmath244 has a fractal dimension equal to the information dimension @xmath2 of the multifractal formalism introduced by hentschel and procaccia . @xcite the particles in this subset carry almost all the growth probability , in such a way that @xmath2 is the fractal dimension of the active zone , i.e. the unscreened surface .",
    "the identification of @xmath2 from figs .",
    "[ fig : mult1 ] , [ fig : mult2 ] is troublesome since there is no tangency at @xmath206 .",
    "the use of the corrected expressions ( [ eq : alpha_assympt ] ) and ( [ eq : f_assympt ] ) is therefore called for , but their application immediately poses the problem of computing up to third order numerical derivatives from noisy , scarce simulation data .",
    "we therefore resorted to fitting to the simulation data several functional forms . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrected ] results for the corrected @xmath0 are shown for the particular choice of the fitting function @xmath245 .",
    "the numerical data are fitted only for the values of @xmath176 in the range @xmath246 for @xmath105 , and @xmath247 for @xmath207 . for the larger values of @xmath176",
    "there is a big uncertainty in the numerical data , thus those parts of the @xmath189 curves are excluded from this particular fitting procedure .",
    "we stress that the fig .",
    "[ fig : corrected ] is shown only as a qualitative illustration of the effects of the corrections terms in equations ( [ eq : alpha_assympt ] ) and ( [ eq : f_assympt ] ) .",
    "in particular , the tangency property is restored in every case , while data collapse is preserved . estimating @xmath2 as the value of @xmath167 where the @xmath167-curve has unit slope we obtain @xmath248 for @xmath249 , which is close to the exact result @xmath250 for dla .",
    "@xcite with decreasing @xmath96 we observe the decrease of @xmath2 , namely we find @xmath251 and @xmath252 for @xmath253 ( the corresponding figure is not shown ) and @xmath207 respectively .",
    "other functional forms yield very similar results .",
    "the corrected spectra have other interesting features as compared to the uncorrected ones . at this point",
    ", however , the discussion has to be kept at a qualitative level since at the extreme values of @xmath176 one faces two different numerical problems : i ) on approaching @xmath1 the derivatives of any order of `` true '' spectra @xmath167 diverge ; ii ) on the other hand , large @xmath176 values correspond to data with poor statistics .",
    "some general observations can nevertheless be made .",
    "there is strong indication that , upon incorporation of the corrections terms : i ) the part of the @xmath177-curve corresponding to large @xmath176 shifts upwards for every temperature ; ii ) data collapse emerges for @xmath254 . in particular , for the values of @xmath255 , @xmath0 takes similar values for both values of @xmath96 , a result consistent with the interpretation that the fractal dimension does not depend on the effective temperature . note also that a remarkable improvement in data - collapse can be observed for the case @xmath207 and large @xmath46 .",
    "finally , there is a slight tendency for @xmath1 to move to the right . for @xmath105 the corrected value gets even closer to its dla value whereas for @xmath207 it keeps at @xmath256 .",
    "we stress that on the whole this same behavior carries over to other fitting choices .",
    "we also calculate the corrections to the measured @xmath189 spectrum in the dipolar scaling regime @xmath257 and small values of @xmath258 .",
    "as expected we get the same @xmath1 and @xmath2 as for large @xmath46 , but no concluding evidence that @xmath6 is going to be the same .    according to the turkevich - scher conjecture @xmath259 , @xcite such behavior of @xmath1",
    "would be in contradiction with the fact that @xmath6 does not change with effective temperature ( as concluded in section [ subsec : paco ] ) .",
    "the above mentioned relation between @xmath6 and @xmath1 is obtained using implicitly the assumption that the most extremal sites of the clusters , or tips , are the most active ones , i.e. @xmath260 .",
    "we have checked the location of the sites with maximum growth probability in the clusters of simulations , and found that they often do not coincide with the clusters tips .",
    "thus , @xmath261 and the more general relation @xmath262 , ref .",
    ", applies in this case .",
    "the diffusion - limited deposition of magnetic particles shows a crossover between two regimes , with a crossover size that sensitively depends on the temperature . at the early stages of growth both the fractal dimension of the trees @xmath17 and their size - distribution , as given by the exponent @xmath18 , are temperature dependent and have significantly smaller values as compared with those of pure dld ( dipolar regime ) . as the size of the trees exceeds the crossover value @xmath16 the diffusion - driven dla scaling regime emerges . in this regime @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 have the same values as in dld .",
    "@xcite here , we have provided evidences that the fractal dimension of the entire deposit remains constant as the deposition proceeds .",
    "this has been done by analyzing the density profile of the deposit , the lateral correlation function , and the mean height and the width of the upper surface .",
    "it ensues that @xmath17 and @xmath18 conspire so as to give a fixed value of @xmath6 .",
    "multifractal analysis shows that , for each value of the interaction parameter and at each stage of growth , the normalized distribution of growth probabilities can be scaled onto a single curve using the same scaling form as in dld thereby providing the @xmath0-spectrum .",
    "the features of the @xmath0 spectra allows us to distinguish the structure of the deposits at high and low temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ two_deposits ] ) .",
    "we have found that @xmath1 decreases significantly with decreasing temperature , revealing that the concentration of the growth probability becomes more and more marked when dipolar interactions are increased .",
    "likewise , the fractal dimension of the active zone @xmath2 decreases with decreasing temperature , meaning that for low temperatures less sites are involved in the growth of the deposit . as a consequence , and since @xmath2 and @xmath1 do not depend on the stage of growth , the presence of dipolar interactions reveals in the structure of the deposits by increasing further the probability of growth at `` hotter '' sites and by originating less dense deposits . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 spectra at late stages of growth suggest that the fractal dimension of the deposits does not depend on temperature ( or dipolar interaction ) , corroborating our previous results .",
    "however , our findings also indicate that the @xmath0-spectra in the high- and low - temperature dla scaling regimes are different .",
    "the multifractal spectrum in the dipolar regime ( low temperature at the early stages of growth ) is clearly different from that in the initial stages of growth at high temperature , thus providing evidence that these two situations have to be held distinct .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum obtained for the dipolar regime was , however , not accurate enough to confirm that the fractal dimension of the deposits in this regime is approximately equal to that of later stages of growth .    in a more general perspective",
    ", this work shows that the information dimension @xmath2 and the scaling exponent @xmath1 are much easier to determine through a numerical measurement of the @xmath0 spectrum then the fractal dimension @xmath6 , provided that the corrections of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_assympt ] ) and ( [ eq : f_assympt ] ) are taken into account .",
    "in fact , the low @xmath88 part of a spectrum can be obtained with good statistics using small systems ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : mult1 ] and [ fig : mult2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , our work suggests that the effect of interactions in dla ( or dld ) deposits could be more easily studied through @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "notice that in @xcite : i ) the dynamics of the dipoles is different : the orientation of their dipolar moments does not change between two consecutive steps , but after each accepted step it relaxes along the total field at the arrival lattice site ; ii ) deposition occurs on a single growth site rather than on a line ( slab geometry ) ; iii ) 2d dipoles satisfying 3d electrostatics are used ."
