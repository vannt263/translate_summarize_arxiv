    "entanglement has been considered as one of the most important resources for quantum information processing and quantum communication including quantum key distribution ( qkd ) and quantum secret sharing ( qss ) .",
    "entanglements can be obtained from several methods , one of which is to utilize a projective measurement on multi - particles . if more than two particles can be handled then a projective measurement on multi - particles such as a bell - state measurement allows the state of the particles to be entangled , although the particles have never been entangled with one another .",
    "we now consider the following four - particle state , @xmath0 here the subscript represents the index of each particle , each @xmath1 is an integer running from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 which is one of @xmath6-dimensional bell states .",

    "( [ eq : entanglement_swapping ] ) has mutually entangled particles 1 and 2 , and mutually entangled particles 3 and 4 .",
    "there does not exist any entanglement between particles 1 and 4 , nor between particles 2 and 3 in the state .",

    "( [ eq : entanglement_swapping ] ) becomes a product state of the form @xmath10 , whose particles 1 and 4 , and particles 2 and 3 are mutually entangled , respectively .",
    "this interesting phenomenon is called the _ entanglement swapping _ ( es ) , which was originally proposed by ukowski",

    "furthermore , the generalizations of es for multipartite and arbitrary dimensional quantum systems were also presented @xcite .",
    "these generalizations possess the more significant meaning in view of the fact that quantum communications in higher dimensional quantum systems are more secure than in two qubits @xcite . on this account",
    ", we consider @xmath6-dimensional quantum systems , called qudits , in this paper .",
    "recently , several practical applications of es , such as the purification protocols  @xcite and the cryptographic protocols  @xcite , have been proposed . in particular , the es - based two - party qkd protocol , presented by cabello  @xcite , permits the secure key distribution , whose structure is different from those of the previous qkd protocols  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the es - based multiparty quantum communication consisting of multiparty qkd and qss protocols  @xcite was suggested  @xcite .",
    "however , this multiparty quantum communication can be shown to be insecure by means of a variant of zhang , li , and guo s eavesdropping strategy  @xcite .",

    "cabello  @xcite extended the es - based qkd protocol between two parties  @xcite into multiparty quantum communication . in this section ,",
    "we review the extended protocol for the three - party quantum communication  @xcite .",

    "we now remark the following two formulas for swapping bell states and ghz states : @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 , which is a ghz state .    by exploiting the above two formulas , the process can be described as follows .",

    "for the secure communication , legal users check the eavesdropping by comparing random subsequences of their key strings with the original correlations .",
    "we note that the basic intercept - resend attacks analogous to the attack presented in  @xcite , may destroy the correlations among the keys , since any eve s attempt to acquire the keys may change the result of the public announcement in an unpredictable way",
    ". therefore , cabello s protocol is secure against such kind of attacks .",
    "zhang , li and guo  @xcite proposed a special strategy for eavesdropping , called the zlg - type attack , which shows that the es - based two - party qkd protocol presented by cabello  @xcite is not secure . in this section , we show that the security of cabello s protocol for the es - based multiparty quantum communication can also be threatened by the zlg - type attack .",

    "* after their measurements , eve intercepts the qudits transmitted from bob ( carol ) , and measures the bell state consisting of one of her qudit and the intercepted qudit from bob ( carol ) .",
    "eve performs the suitable local operation on the qudits which she intercepts from alice , according to the measurement result of the ghz state as in the following : if we let @xmath33 be the measurement result of the two bell states , then eve applies the local operation @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the unitary operations defined by @xmath37 + using the following relation @xmath38 the resulting state can be described by @xmath39 , after applying the local operation in ( [ eq : local_operation ] ) . *",
    "eve returns the two qudits to alice after the above operations",

    "( [ eq : original_final_state ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : modified_final_state ] ) , our modified protocol provides legal users with the same correlation as that in the original cabello s protocol .",
    "furthermore , legal users can detect any eavesdropping unless eve knows bob and carol s choices of their operations beforehand .",
    "we are now going to discuss the security of our modified protocol in detail .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , it is impossible for eve to get all information unless she knows bob and carol s decisions beforehand .",
    "more precisely , legal users can detect eve s presence with the probability not less than @xmath52 ^ 2 $ ] for each testing key , since after applying the qft to one qudit of a bell state one can obtain one of bell states as the bell - measurement result with the probability at most @xmath53 . thus if legal users check sufficiently large @xmath54 keys , with the probability not less than @xmath52^{2m}$ ] , eve can be detected .",
    "eve can be detected with the probability , not less than we note that in the @xmath55-party quantum communication the probability to detect eve in the zlg - type attack , is at least @xmath52^{n-1}$ ] for each testing key .",
    "therefore , our modified protocol for multiparty quantum communication is secure against the zlg - type attack .",
    "now , we consider the basic intercept - resend attacks on the protocol . in the three - party quantum communication , the basic intercept - resend attacks can be divided into two cases , one - party attack and two - party attack .",

    "in order to investigate the security of the protocol , we are going to calculate the probability with which legal users can detect eve for each case .",
    "the one - party attack on our modified protocol is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fi3 ] and can be described as follows .",
    "* legal users prepare the same qudits as those in our modified protocol , and eve prepares two bell states to obtain the information on bob s key .",
    "* when alice sends one qudit of her ghz state to bob ( carol ) , and bob ( carol ) sends alice one qudit of his ( her ) bell state , eve intercepts the qudit transmitted from alice to bob and the qudit transmitted from bob to alice , and sends one qudit of her one bell state to alice and one qudit of the other bell state to bob .",
    "bob ( carol ) randomly applies either the qft or the identity operation to the other qudit of his ( her ) bell state .",
    "alice and bob ( carol ) perform bell measurements as in the our modified protocol .",
    "while alice and bob ( carol ) perform bell measurements , eve also performs a bell measurement on the qudit which she intercepts from alice and her qudit of the bell state as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fi3 ] ( b ) . * after bob ( carol ) announces his ( her ) operation chosen in the previous step , eve performs the inverse of his operation and then measures a bell measurement on the state containing the qudit .",
    "finally , legal users check the correlation among their measurement results .",
    "eve s presence can be detected since eve can not fabricate the correlation among the legal users keys without knowing bob and carol s choices of the operations in step ( b ) .",
    "we now remind that if one applies the qft to one qudit of a bell state ( or a ghz state ) then with the probability at most @xmath53 one can get one of bell states ( or ghz states ) using a bell - state measurement ( or a ghz - state measurement ) .",
    "thus , we can easily obtain that the probability of revealing the presence of eve , who attempts the one - party attack , is not less than @xmath56 for each testing key .    in the @xmath55-party quantum communication , the probability to detect eve for",

    "furthermore , we can obtain from these probabilities the fact that the higher the dimension of quantum system is , the more secure the communication becomes .      the two - party attack on our modified protocol is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fi4 ] and is described as follows .    * the initial states of legal users are the same as those in our modified protocol .",
    "eve prepares two bell states and one ghz state .",

    "thus , legal users can detect eve s intervention by publicly comparing a sufficiently large random subset of their sequences of key strings .",
    "we can straightforwardly show that the probability with which eve can be detected in the three - party quantum communication , is at least @xmath58 for each testing key .",

    "thus , employing eq .",
    "( [ eq:3-party_2p_prob ] ) , one can obtain that the probability of detecting eve s presence in the @xmath55-party quantum communication is not less than @xmath60 for each testing key .",
    "it follows from the above probability in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n - party_2p_prob ] ) that as the dimension of the system or the number of parties increases , the multiparty quantum communication including the multiparty qkd and qss is more secure against the two - party attack .",
