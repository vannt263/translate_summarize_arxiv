    "the origin of cosmic rays ( cr ) above @xmath5 ev ( 1 pev ) has been a long - standing problem .",
    "observation of neutral particles , which can be directly traced back to the sources , is a unique way to search for point sources of crs under @xmath6",
    "there are many energetic astrophysical sources such as gamma ray bursts ( grb ) or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "those objects could accelerate particles to ultra - high energy and produce crs , gamma rays , and neutrinos @xcite .",
    "for photons at @xmath7 ev to @xmath8 ev , their attenuation length for interaction with cosmological microwave background photons are approximately 10 kpc , roughly the distance from the solar system to the galactic center .",
    "neutrinos are the only choice for exploring remote cr sources .",
    "observation of ultra - high - energy neutrinos is not only an important proof of their existence but also an orthogonal tool , besides conventional astronomical tools such as optical and radio observation , for studying grbs or agns .",
    "however , because of very weak interaction , neutrino detection requires a huge volume of detector medium . conventional way of neutrino detection is to build or locate a huge volume of target and bury detectors inside so that charged particles as products of interaction between incident neutrinos and target material can be detected . as an example ,",
    "the icecube experiment , located near the geographic south pole in antarctica , uses natural ice approximately 2 km under the surface as the target and strings of uv sensitive optical modules buried in the ice to detect cherenkov light generated by muons and electrons that are produced in interaction of incident neutrinos@xcite . working in the similar principle ,",
    "the antares experiment uses natural water in mediterranean sea instead of ice and sinks strings of similar optical modules down to the sea bed to detect cherenkov photons@xcite .",
    "the main advantage of underwater / ice neutrino detectors is in the ability to collect muons from large distances since muon range is much longer compared to electron or tau range",
    ". for electrons generated by e - neutrino , cascade in the sensitive area of the detector can be reconstructed . for @xmath0 neutrinos in certain energy range , both interaction vertex where",
    "@xmath0 lepton is produced and @xmath0 decay vertex might be contained in the sensitive area so that yields a clear signature of `` double bang '' .",
    "therefore , the detector is sensitive to all species of incident neutrinos with somewhat clear signature for different species . due to a limited attenuation length of cherenkov light , spacing between optical modules must be sufficiently small in order to collect sufficient cherenkov photons that enables reasonable reconstruction of tracks or showers inside the detector .",
    "this is a disadvantage of this type of detector in terms of costs of construction .",
    "it is substantial in the case of neutrino observation with very low statistics , e.g. typically tens of events per year for a scale of experiments such as icecube . to seek some more economic ways to build larger detectors for statistically significant measurements",
    "is in fact essential .",
    "sometimes , one has to sacrifice some performance of the detector to fulfill the goal .",
    "one of many ways to explore economic detection of ultra - high - energy neutrinos is to separate the detector volume from the target volume in which the incident neutrino interacts . by doing so",
    ", the target volume can be as large as a piece of mountain or even a part of the earth shell without putting any detector inside , and the detector volume can be as large as the nearby atmosphere , such as that for the hires experiment@xcite and the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) experiment@xcite , both are primarily designed for detecting cosmic rays above 1eev .",
    "an obvious disadvantage is that the interaction vertex is no longer in the scope of the detector .",
    "a potential difficulty might be that the observation could be contaminated by the cosmic ray background .",
    "there exists a solution to avoid the cosmic ray background by slightly reduce the detector volume with a more dedicated design of configuration that uses the fluorescence / cherenkov telescopes , such as hires / auger telescopes , to watch a volume of a few kilometers behind a mountain and keep the field of view of those telescopes in the shadow of the mountain .",
    "the mountain plays not only a role as a huge target , but also a screen of cosmic rays coming into the field of view of the detector . by mainly collecting cherenkov photons , instead of fluorescence photons , generated in air showers ,",
    "such an array of telescopes can work at energies as low as 1pev , the same energy range as the icecube experiment .",
    "this technique is reasonably inexpensive and the detector aperture can be easily increased in scale to compensate for the disadvantage of this technique only effectively detecting tau neutrinos . in the rest of this paper , we are discussing detailed physics perspectives with one of specific configuration of this type of detector .    before going to more details ,",
    "let us briefly review the principle of the detection method .",
    "incident neutrinos convert into electrons , muons and taus in a mountain through the charged current interaction depending upon their flavor .",
    "electrons will shower quickly inside the target material .",
    "muons travel very long distance before decaying , therefore , they are not easy to be detected using this method .",
    "@xmath0 leptons produced inside the mountain , that have sufficiently long life - time to escape from the mountain , decay and induce showers in the air",
    ". conventional air shower detector , such as fluorescence / cherenkov telescopes , can be used then to detect them .",
    "the cosmic ray tau neutrino telescope ( crtnt ) experiment is designed to detect those neutrino - induced air showers@xcite . to find a suitable site for the experiment is not trivial because it must be sufficiently dry year round and",
    "the mountain must be sufficiently steep so that there is enough space for showers well developed to be detectable . strongly depending upon the specific thickness of the mountain and terrain of the site",
    ", the crtnt experiment needs to be reevaluated for its feasibility with very much updated agn neutrino models and simulation tools . since publication of the reference @xcite which addressed basic principle of the detection , there are many progresses in amandaii data analysis , neutrino models and simulation techniques .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address them in somewhat details .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the configuration of the crtnt detector is described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 details the procedure of @xmath0 neutrino converting into @xmath0 lepton in the mountain and detecting of air shower initiated by the @xmath0 lepton . in sections 4 , 5 and 6 ,",
    "the event rate and sensitivity of the crtnt detector are estimated .",
    "we summarize all results for this study and compare with previous works in the last section .",
    "the proposed crtnt project , which currently has two telescopes as a prototype running at tibet site@xcite and detecting cosmic ray showers that observed by the argo - ybj experiment@xcite , uses fluorescence / cherenkov light telescopes to detect air showers induced by tau neutrinos .",

    "therefore , cutting on both com elevation and number of rows of triggered tubes in a shower as shown in figure7(d ) , i.e. the com elevation must be lower than 10@xmath47 and number of rows must be less than 13 , neutrino events will be picked out .",
