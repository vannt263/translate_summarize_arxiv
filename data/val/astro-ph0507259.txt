    "the x - ray source  ( x1722 - 36 ) was discovered during galactic plane observations made with exosat ( warwick et al .",

    "( 1989 ) proposed that  was a system consisting of a neutron star accreting material from a be star .",
    "additional pulse timing observations were made with ginga by takeuchi , koyama & warwick ( 1990 ) who derived lower limits on the orbital period and mass of the primary star of 9 d and 15 mrespectively .",
    "takeuchi et al . ( 1990 ) also observed x - ray flaring activity on time scales down to a few hours .",
    "in this paper we present the results of extended monitoring scan observations made with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite which reveal the orbital period of the system .",
    "a set of pointed observations was also obtained which provide spectral and pulse timing information .",
    "in addition , utilizing a refined source position obtained by the integral satellite ( lutovinov , revnivtsev & molkov 2003 , revnivtsev et al .",
    "2004 ) we have obtained a long term light curve with the rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) .",
    "the source properties suggest that this system consists of a neutron star accreting from the stellar wind of an early spectral type supergiant companion .",
    "in this paper we present the results of observations of  that have been made with two of the instruments on board rxte ( bradt , rothschild , & swank 1983 ) : the pca and the asm .",
    "the pca is described in detail by jahoda et al .",
    "this instrument consists of five , nearly identical , proportional counter units ( pcus ) sensitive to x - rays with energies between 2 - 60 kev with a total effective area of 6500 @xmath1 .",
    "the pcus each have a multi - anode xenon - filled volume , with a front propane volume which is primarily used for background rejection .",
    "the crab produces 13,000 counts / s for the entire pca across the complete energy band .",
    "the pca spectral resolution at 6 kev is approximately 18% and the field of view is 1  full width half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "not all of the pcus are always operated during an observation and corrections have been made in our analysis , where necessary , for the varying number of pcus operating at any one time .",
    "data extraction , including background subtraction , followed standard procedures for rxte pca analysis described by the rxte guest observer facility .",
    "pca observations of  were obtained in two different ways : + ( i ) a series of scans across the galactic center region has been performed since 1999 ( swank & markwardt 2001 ) and data from the interval february 1999 to october 2003 are presented here .",
    "the observations consist of raster scans of a rectangular region approximately 16@xmath2 16surrounding the galactic center made on a twice weekly basis excluding november , december , january and june when sun constraints prevent observations .",
    "these scans are optimized to detect faint sources and so light curves are constructed using only the top layer of the pca and cover the energy range 2 to 10 kev . with these parameters the crab produces 10,400 counts",
    "/ s for the sum of all 5 pcus .",
    "individual source count rates are modulated by the pca collimator as they pass into and out of the field of view .",
    "light curves , corrected for non - source background , are fitted to a model of known sources plus a model of unresolved emission from the galactic ridge , convolved with the collimator response function .",
    "the nominal @xmath3 sensitivity to variations is approximately 0.51 mcrab in the regions more than a few degrees from the galactic center (  has galactic coordinates of @xmath4 = 351.5 , @xmath5 = -0.4 ) .",

    "another observation , of xtej1723 - 376 for proposal number 40705 ( pi : w. cui ) , occurred in 1999 , during an eclipse of .",
    "xtej1723 - 376 was in quiescence , as indicated by asm and the pca bulge scans , during the observations of .",
    "observations were interrupted because of instrumental constraints such as earth occultations of the source and passages through the south atlantic anomaly when the instruments are not operated , and because observations of other sources were also undertaken during these periods .",
    "the resulting total effective exposure time was 50.9 ks .",
    "all 5 pcus were operating during the 1998 observations and 3 pcus were operating during the 2003 observations .",

    "the light curve from the pointed pca observations of obtained in 1998 is shown in fig .",
    "the asm ( levine et al . 1996 ) consists of three similar scanning shadow cameras , sensitive to x - rays in an energy band of approximately 2 - 12 kev , which perform sets of 90 second pointed observations ( `` dwells '' ) so as to cover 80% of the sky every 90 minutes .",
    "the crab produces approximately 75 counts / s in the asm over the entire energy range .",
    "observations of blank field regions away from the galactic center suggest that background subtraction may produce a systematic uncertainty of about 0.1 counts / s ( remillard & levine 1997 ) .",
    "to extract a light curve from asm observations it is necessary to have an accurate source location and the coordinates reported by lutovinov et al .",

    "we note lutovinov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) give coordinates that are 3  from this location ; this difference is too small to make a large difference to the asm light curve .",
    "the asm light curve of considered here covers approximately 9 years .",
    "the asm data were filtered by excluding all dwells where the modeled background in the lowest energy band was greater than 10 counts / s .",
    "this procedure helps to exclude points where the data are contaminated by solar x - rays .",
    "using the long term light curve obtained from the pca scan observations ( fig .",
    "1 ) a power spectrum was calculated .",
    "the results of this are shown in fig .",
    "a highly significant peak is seen at a frequency corresponding to a period of approximately 9.7 days .",
    "the orbital period determination was refined by undertaking a sine wave fit to the light curve .",
    "this procedure yielded a period of 9.741 @xmath0 0.004 days with epoch of minimum flux of mjd 51218.97 @xmath0 0.22 .",
    "the pca scan light curve folded on this period is shown in fig .",
    "we note the presence of a deep minimum , consistent with an eclipse , at phase 0 .    in order to quantify this eclipse",
    "we fitted the folded light curve with a simple eclipse model consisting of constant flux outside eclipse , constant flux during full eclipse , and linear transitions between these levels during eclipse ingress and egress .",
    "the results of this fit are given in table 1 . as the eclipse profile fit gives a more precise value for the center of the minimum than does the sine wave fit we use the eclipse fit to define `` t0 '' ( eclipse center ) in our following analysis .    from the eclipse profile",
    "fit we find a nominal count rate of -0.3 @xmath0 0.1 counts / s / pcu during the eclipse .",
    "that is , the count rate is consistent with a total eclipse within the errors with a slight systematic underestimate from the fitting process .",
    "we can extrapolate our ephemeris back to the two sets of ginga observations . during the observations reported by tawara et al .",
    "( 1989 ) the flux of  was observed to decline to a very low level on 1987 october 10 ( mjd 47078 ) .",
    "our ephemeris gives a phase of @xmath9 = 0.93 @xmath0 0.17 for the end of this observation . in the light curve presented by takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) a very low flux was observed on 1988 april 3 ( mjd 47254 ) .",
    "our ephemeris gives @xmath9 = 0.92 @xmath0 0.17 .",
    "thus both ginga observations of low flux from  are consistent with these events being associated with an eclipse .",
    "the light curve from the pointed pca observations of  obtained in 1998 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . there is considerable source variability and pulsations are clearly detected at most times . during the interval",
    "mjd 51122.0 to 51122.16 the source flux is observed to be constant at a low level of about 4.9 counts / s / pcu .",
    "this corresponds to phases of 0.006 to 0.022 using our ephemeris from the scan observations and , during this interval , no pulsations are detectable .",
    "the source is thus likely to be completely in eclipse at this time .",
    "is located close to the galactic center at @xmath4 = 351.5 , @xmath5 = -0.3and significant emission from the galactic ridge ( e.g. valinia & marshall 1998 ) , and perhaps other sources , is to be expected within the pca field of view .",
    "the non - zero count rate found in the pointed observations is consistent with the modeled galactic ridge flux used in determining source flux seen in the scans . between mjd 51113.1 to 51113.3 ( phases 0.092 to 0.113 )",
    "the source is seen to be increasing from a low flux level of about 4.9 counts / s / pcu ( fig .",
    "5 ) , consistent with the observation of an eclipse egress .",
    "pulse arrival times were obtained from this light curve by means of a cross - correlation procedure .",
    "the sparse orbital coverage severely limits the constraints which the timing data can place on the orbital parameters .",
    "we fitted a circular orbit with no spin period change , and with the orbital period fixed at the value obtained from our pca scan data .",
    "we conducted a grid search to find the orbital solution with the lowest @xmath10 for the pulse arrival times .",
    "the solution is given in table 2 and plotted in fig .",
    "the best fit for t90 ( the same as the eclipse center for a circular orbit ) agrees with the center of the eclipse in table 1 .",
    "we note that the value for @xmath11sin  @xmath12 is consistent with the constraints obtained by takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for an orbital period of 9.741 d. the overall pulse profile , corrected for the orbital solution is plotted in fig .",
    "7 .      for spectral analysis we divided the pointed pca observations into 18 separate accumulated spectra as specified in table 3 .",
    "one spectrum was accumulated for each `` good time interval '' , i.e. each continuous data collection period between source occultations , south atlantic anomaly passages or observations of other sources .",
    "response matrices were created using version 10.1 of the program `` pcarmf '' .    the light curve from the pointed pca observations ( section 3.1.2 , fig .",
    "2 ) , in particular the significant flux detected during eclipse in contrast to the scan observation indicates significant galactic ridge contamination .",
    "we therefore first fitted the eclipse spectra ( numbers 11 , 12 , and 13 ) to determine the level of this contribution .",
    "following valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) we fitted a model consisting of a raymond - smith plasma and power - law components and this model was found to give a good fit .",
    "the spectral fit is shown in fig .",
    "8 and the best fit parameters are given in table 4 .",
    "this spectrum was included as a fixed component in the models for the spectra of other phases .",
    "the spectra of x - ray pulsars are commonly fit with a model consisting of an absorbed power law spectrum with a high energy cutoff and , in some cases , an iron line near 6.4 kev ( e.g. white , swank & holt , 1983 ) .",
    "such a model was employed by takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to fit the spectrum of , while tawara et al .",
    "( 1989 ) used a simpler model with no high - energy cutoff .",
    "for the pca data ( fitting the 2 - 40 kev range ) we find , however , that not all the rxte spectra of  can be satisfactorily fit with the usual cutoff power - law spectrum . with experimentation , we found that adding a low energy ( 0.85 kev ) blackbody component gave satisfactory fits in those cases , with the exception of spectrum number 1 , which required additional components of an iron line and an additional unabsorbed blackbody",
    ". only for spectrum number 1 was an iron line clearly required and so we did not include this component in the final fits of the other spectra .",
    "the resulting spectral parameters are listed in tables 5 and 6 and the spectra and fits are shown in fig .",
    "we note that the hydrogen column density obtained appears to be relatively constant with the exception of the three spectra obtained during eclipse egress ( 5 , 6 , & 7 ) and the one ( 17 ) closest to ingress ; for these increased absorption is found .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum does vary , but not dramatically , and the source is too faint ( 0.5 - 5 mcrab ) and the observations too incomplete to draw conclusions about the variations .",
    "although spectrum number 1 is the only spectrum that requires additional model components , we find no evidence for any problem , such as excess background , with this particular spectrum .",
    "since the pca has a 1  fwhm field of view , it is possible that a contaminating source present in the field had a flare that affected only this spectrum and not spectrum number 2 which was obtained shortly after spectrum number 1 .",
    "spectrum 17 shows some small but possibly systematic residuals in the vicinity of 6.4 kev .",
    "this may be an indication that the background was somewhat different for this slightly different pointing position .",
    "the mean count rate from  measured with the asm was 0.3 counts / s .",
    "we calculated the power spectrum of the rxte asm light curve of  and found that , although a small peak was present in the power spectrum near the orbital period at 9.738 @xmath0 0.02d ( hwhm ) , it would not have been possible a priori to determine the orbital period of this system from the asm data alone .",
    "this peak is not of statistical significance and is far from the strongest peak in the power spectrum . in fig .",
    "10 we show the asm data folded on the orbital period found from the pca scan data .",
    "it can be seen that the asm data show a very similar overall modulation to that observed with the pca and that the phasing of flux minimum is consistent between the two instruments .",
    "we can thus have reasonable confidence that the asm is indeed measuring flux variability from  in spite of the lack of a significant peak in the power spectrum .",
    "the quality of light curves that can be obtained with the asm depends on the accuracy with which a source position is known .",
    "we note that the integral coordinates given by revnivtsev et al .",

    "x - ray pulsars are generally high mass systems in which the primary is an o or b type star .",
    "this is the case for  as shown by the large mass function obtained from the pulse timing measurements of takeuchi et al .",
    "high mass x - ray binaries can be broadly divided into those systems where the primary star is a supergiant and those where the primary is a luminosity class iii - v be star .",
    "several pieces of evidence indicate that  has a supergiant primary .",
    "the detection of an eclipse indicates a substantial size for the primary star .",
    "the probability of a be star system showing an eclipse is very low due to the small size of the mass donor and , even if an eclipse were to be observed in such a system it would only have a very short duration .",
    "in addition , the values of the pulse and orbital periods are also typical for a supergiant system ( corbet 1986 ) . our orbital solution ( fig .",
    "6 ) has an amplitude of 111.1 @xmath0 0.7 s , which corresponds to a mass function of 15.4 @xmath0 0.1 m. this mass function is comparable with that found for several other supergiant systems ( e.g. van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) , but conclusive determination of system parameters awaits pulse arrival time measurements with more complete orbital phase coverage .",
    "supergiant systems can be further divided into those systems where the compact object accretes from the stellar wind of the primary and those rare systems where mass accretion occurs because the primary fills its roche lobe",
    ".  is likely to be a wind - accretion driven system because its relatively low luminosity and long spin period indicate only modest mass and angular momentum accretion unlike roche - lobe overflow powered systems ( e.g. bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in several cases",
    "our spectral fits require a black body component in addition to the usual cutoff power - law .",
    "soft black body spectral components have been observed in several luminous x - ray pulsars such as smc x-1 and lmc x-4 ( e.g. paul et al . 2002 , hickox , narayan , & kallman , 2004 . and references therein ) .",

    ". it would be valuable to obtain frequent pulse timing measurements of over at least one entire orbital period so that the system parameters including mass function and eccentricity can be precisely determined . as  is an eclipsing binary",
    "there is the promise of determining an accurate neutron star mass for this system . to measure this",
    "it would be very valuable if an optical or ir counterpart can be found and the orbital radial velocity of the counterpart measured .",
    "this identification of a counterpart will likely require a significantly improved x - ray position over the one currently available .",
    "information on the mass - donor star can also be obtained from the precise determination of eclipse ingress and egress times . the determination and monitoring of eclipse times",
    "would also facilitate a search for changes in orbital period .",
