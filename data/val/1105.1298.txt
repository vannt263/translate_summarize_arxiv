    "type ia supernovae ( sneia ) are the most homogeneous type of stellar explosions , and one of the most luminous .",
    "they are used to constrain the energy content of the universe and provided the first direct evidence of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "sneia are not standard candles per se , but they can be standardised ( with a dispersion of @xmath5 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thanks to a rather tight relation between their luminosity and the shape of their light curve .",
    "this was first suggested by @xcite , who parametrised the light curves of sneia based on a single quantity , @xmath6 , the decline of the @xmath7 band magnitude from maximum to 15 days later .",
    "sneia come with a rather large range of luminosities .",
    "their absolute magnitudes range from @xmath8 for the dimmest events like sn1991bg @xcite to @xmath9 for the superluminous ,  super - chandrasekhar \" sne @xcite , but the bulk of spectroscopically normal sne has a smaller spread , between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these are the majority of sne ia . at the luminous end of this range confusion with the spectroscopically peculiar 1991t - like events",
    "may occur , since these show similar decline rates and luminosities as some spectroscopically normal sne ( e.g.  sn1999aa , * ? ? ?",
    "at the dim end , however , peculiar events similar to sn1991bg , with @xmath6@xmath12mag appear to be separated from even the dimmest of the normal sne , such as sne1992a or 2004eo , which have @xmath6 @xmath13mag .",
    "only few sne are known that have intermediate decline rates ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "a classically known example is sn1986 g ( @xmath6@xmath14mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which however shows many properties of the sn1991bg group , in particular the presence of a strong ti  ii  absorption trough between 4000 and 4500  at maximum light and the evolution of the si  ii  absorption velocity @xcite .    since 1991bg - like sneia",
    "are almost exclusively observed in early - type galaxies @xcite the question arises whether they may have entirely different progenitors . for the bulk of sneia a carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf accreting hydrogen in a binary system has traditionally been the scenario of choice , because it is thought to be able to give rise to homogeneous explosions .",
    "the observed range of sn luminosities can be attributed to the synthesis of different amounts of @xmath15ni  in the explosion @xcite .",
    "the most promising way to tune this parameter is given by the explosion scenario known as delayed detonation @xcite , although the details of the transition from subsonic to supersonic burning are not clear .",
    "a recently revived alternative scenario is that some fraction of the sneia come from the merging of two white dwarfs whose combined mass exceeds the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "another scenario is the explosion of a white dwarf with a mass below the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "this is thought to occur if the white dwarf accretes helium from a companion .",
    "the helium shell which builds up is very unstable and can detonate , triggering the explosion of the entire star @xcite .",
    "this scenario was not favoured because it was reported to lead to inconsistent sn spectra @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite present sub - chandrasekhar snia models where the overlying he layer is omitted and suggest that these models reproduce the observed range of light curve properties of sneia ( from intermediate to dim ) , and that spectra obtained from their models also resemble observed spectra .    still , most sneia , excluding perhaps the least luminous , 1991bg - like ones ,",
    "seem to be consistent with the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .    a powerful method of investigating the properties of sn ejecta is late - time spectroscopy , which probes the inner layers of the sn .",
    "@xcite showed that the simultaneous availability of optical and infrared ( ir ) late - time spectra makes it possible to account for all the most abundant elements produced in a sn , and to infer their abundances .",
    "not many late - time ir spectra are available for sneia .",
    "one of the best examples is sn2003hv .",
    "@xcite published ir spectra which @xcite rescaled to match ir photometry taken at an epoch similar to that of a mid - ir spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is not the only thing that makes sn2003hv interesting .",
    "the sn has a decline rate @xmath6@xmath16mag @xcite .",
    "a snia with such a decline rate could be the missing link between spectroscopically normal sneia and underluminous sne of the 1991bg class .",
    "sn2003hv may be the first well - observed sn with this decline rate .",
    "@xcite presented a very good data set covering the post - maximum phase .",
    "additionally , sn2003hv was noted for the peculiar shifts of several nebular ir emission lines , some of which also seem to show flat tops @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that similar displacements are observed in the optical lines of [ fe  ii ] .",
    "this was interpreted as possibly the indication of a high - density neutron - capture region , where stable @xmath17ni  and @xmath18fe  rather than radioactive @xmath15ni  are produced .",
    "this region would peculiarly be displaced from the centre of the explosion @xcite .",
    "this finding led to further work in this direction @xcite , which is however not the subject of the present paper .",
    "* fig.7 ) showed a synthetic optical / near - ir spectrum based on the classical explosion model w7 @xcite .",
    "this is a chandrasekhar - mass model , with kinetic energy @xmath19@xmath20 erg , which was developed to account for the bulk properties of sneia @xcite and has been used as a standard reference to describe this class of sne .",
    "while the overall reproduction of the spectrum is good , they encountered a few problems , which they mentioned and discussed @xcite .",
    "most evidently , the near - ir flux ( @xmath21 ) is overestimated by the model by a factor of a few .",
    "additionally , the ratio of the two strongest optical features , the fe - dominated lines near 4700 and 5200 , is not reproduced . while the bluer feature is dominated by [ fe  iii ] lines ,",
    "the redder one is predominantly due to [ fe  ii ] transitions .",
    "the bluer feature is well reproduced in @xcite , while the redder one is overestimated by about a factor of 2 .",
    "since most of the near - ir lines whose flux is also overestimated are themselves [ fe  ii ] transitions this seems to indicate that the ionization balance in the sn2003hv nebula is different from that predicted by w7 . among other possibilities ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the lack of near - ir flux might be attributed to a sudden onset of an infrared catastrophe in the densest region of clumpy ejecta .",
    "the ir catastrophe ( irc ) is a sudden shift of the nebular emission to mid - ir lines , which occurs when the temperature of the sn nebula becomes sufficiently low @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that an irc may have occurred at earlier times , and that this may be possible if the ejecta are clumpy .",
    "they also find that positrons are likely to be fully trapped .",
    "given the special role of sn2003hv as a possible link between normal and subluminous sneia , and the significance of the late - time data available , we have tried to reproduce these data with our nebular code .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe our nebular code ; in section 3 we show and discuss synthetic spectra obtained adopting different scenarios ; in section 4 we discuss the time evolution of the nebular emission ; in section 5 our results are recapped and discussed .",
    "finally , section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "@xcite present a combined optical , near - ir and mid - ir spectrum of sn2003hv in the nebular phase .",
    "the optical spectrum was obtained at the eso - vlt 320 days after @xmath7-band maximum .",
    "the near - ir spectrum was obtained at subaru 394 days after @xmath7-band maximum @xcite , while the mid - ir spectrum was obtained from _ spitzer",
    "_ 358 days after @xmath7-band maximum @xcite . since the optical and ir data were not obtained simultaneously , @xcite rescaled the optical spectrum and the near - ir spectrum to match the photometry of day 355 after maximum , the epoch of the mid - ir observations .",
    "given the relatively short time elapsed between the optical and near - ir observations , it can be hoped that the spectrum did not evolve much in shape .",
    "we use the data presented in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite .    at these late times",
    ", the spectrum of sn2003hv is dominated by nebular emission .",
    "the gas is optically thin to optical and ir radiation , and it is heated by the deposition of the @xmath22 rays and positrons from the decay of @xmath15co  to @xmath15fe  ( @xmath15ni  has almost completely decayed to @xmath15co ) .",
    "collisional heating is balanced by cooling via emission , and the energy is released in a number of line transitions , most of which are forbidden .",
    "we use a non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) nebular code which was developed by @xcite and is based on ideas of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although a three - dimensional version is available @xcite the code was used in its one - dimensional version here .",
    "our ( one - dimensional ) models consist of about 20 radial shells of varying density and composition .",
    "the emission and deposition of @xmath22 rays and positrons is computed with a montecarlo scheme , following @xcite and @xcite , using effective opacities for @xmath22 rays and positrons .    after energy deposition , an iteration process is initiated .",
    "starting with an initial guess for the ionisation state and the temperature of the gas , non - thermal ionisation and excitation rates are derived using the bethe and the optical approximation respectively @xcite , which have been shown to be accurate to at least 20% for h and he @xcite . for other elements",
    "the accuracy of these approximations is difficult to estimate , since there is a strong dependence on poorly known atomic data .",
    "since our nebular code neglects radiation transport , there is no photo - ionisation .",
    "the collisional ionisation rates are balanced with the radiative and the di - electronic recombination rates taken from @xcite .",
    "charge exchange reactions are not considered . after obtaining the new ionisation state and consequently a new electron density , the level population of each ion",
    "is derived by solving a matrix containing collisional ( de-)excitation and radiative de - excitation rates .",
    "the radiative rates are reduced according to the sobolev optical depths of the corresponding lines .",
    "knowing all the level populations , a radiation field can be generated and can be compared to the total deposited luminosity .",
    "the electron temperature ( and consequently the electron density ) is then adjusted in each iteration step , until the total luminosity of the radiation field has converged to the deposited luminosity .",
    "the code can treat the neutral and singly ionized states of h , he , c , n , o , ne , na , mg , si , s , ar & ca and the singly and doubly ionized states of fe , co & ni . for light and intermediate - mass elements typically the lowest 10 @xmath23 20 levels are taken into account in the excitation calculation . for iron - group elements",
    "roughly the 100 lowest energy levels of each ion are considered .",
    "collisional data are available for several hundred transitions of h , he , c , n , o , ne , na , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , co & ni . most of the collisional data are taken from @xcite or from online databases ( e.g. tiptop , a. pradhanpradhan/ ] ) and are updated frequently .",
    "collisional data are available for the most important forbidden lines , but those for co are unfortunately very poor . if not available , the collision strength of forbidden lines is crudely set to 0.01@xmath24 @xcite , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the statistical weights of the lower and the upper atomic level respectively .",
    "unknown collisional data for allowed transitions are obtained in the @xcite approximation .",
    "although missing collisional data pose a problem for all kinds of nebular calculations , the largest uncertainties in our calculations are caused by neglecting photo - ionization .",
    "it is clear that the neutral species of the iron - group elements are photo - ionized almost completely in sne ia at the epochs of interest ( 200 - 400 days after the explosion ) . to simulate this effect , fe  i , co  i  and ni  i  are not included in our calculation .",
    "the ratio of fe  iii  to fe  ii  is determined by the non - thermal electron ionisation rates , which is a good approximation . for light and intermediate - mass elements",
    "the problem is more serious and it is not clear if we can produce the ionisation state of those elements correctly .",
    "however , since our synthetic spectra are dominated by fe  iiand fe  iii  emission lines , we expect them to be reliable within the uncertainties of the atomic data .",
    "the code has been used to investigate the morphology and composition of the spectra of various sne ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "a 1-zone version makes it possible to derive very quickly the basic properties of the emitting nebula ( mass , energy , composition ) using the maximum observed emission line velocity as an outer boundary . in a more sophisticated stratified version",
    "the density varies as a function of velocity ( which is equivalent to radius in the homologously expanding sn nebula ) and so do the abundances .",
    "these can be modified in order to reproduce the observations , yielding a rather accurate description of the structure of the sn ejecta .",
    "the density structure can be taken from a model calculation ( e.g.  w7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it can also be derived from the emitted luminosity and the line shapes .    for all calculations we adopt for sn2003hv a distance modulus of 31.58 mag @xcite and a reddening @xmath27mag @xcite .",

    "the spectra have been normalised at the peak of the 4700  emission.,width=336 ]",
    "the late - time optical spectra of sneia are dominated by strong emission in forbidden lines at @xmath32 and 5200 .",
    "the features are broadened because they are blends of many lines , so that their width is larger than the real velocity of the emitting gas .",
    "the bluer feature is dominated by [ fe  iii ] lines ( @xmath33 , 4658 , 4667 , 4701 , 4734 , 4755 , 4881 ) , with some [ fe  ii ] lines ( @xmath34 , 4874 , 4890 ) also contributing , while the redder one has comparable contributions of [ fe  ii ] ( @xmath35 , 5159 , 5222 , 5262 ) and [ fe  iii ] lines ( @xmath36 , 5412 ) .",
    "a correlation exists between the width of the features and the luminosity of the sn as described by the light - curve decline paramater @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this is because a more luminous sn burns more of the progenitor white dwarf into @xmath15ni , which is observed at late times as fe emission .",
    "the availability of the near - ir spectrum makes it possible to study all elements that are supposed to be abundantly synthesised in a thermonuclear explosion .    to begin with ,",
    "we compare the optical spectrum of sn2003hv to those of other sneia with similar decline rates .",
    "figure 1 shows the blue part of the nebular spectra of 4 sneia : sn2003hv ( @xmath6@xmath28mag ) , sn1986 g ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6@xmath31mag ) , sn2004eo ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6@xmath29mag ) , and sn1989b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6@xmath30mag ) . with the exception of sn2003hv all spectra are from the asiago database .",
    "they have all been corrected for reddening , and are plotted after normalizing at the peak of the 4700  line .",
    "sn1986 g has the narrowest emission lines , as may be expected given that this sn has the most rapidly declining light curve .",
    "the other 3 sne have all rather similar line width .",
    "sn2003hv stands out for the much higher ratio of the 4700  emission feature with respect to the 5200  one .",
    "we begin with modelling the optical spectrum alone . for this purpose",
    "we use the optical spectrum calibrated to the original photometry of the epoch when it was actually observed , 320 days after maximum , thus avoiding any unforeseen evolution between then and the epoch of the near- or mid - ir spectrum .",
    "we discuss here various models .",
    "we use the one - zone version of the code in order to determine the velocity width of the emitting nebula , assuming that it is spherically symmetric .",
    "the emission lines of sn2003hv can be reproduced for a width of the emitting region of @xmath37 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we also measure the fwhm of the 4700  line , finding a value of @xmath38 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "both of these values are consistent with fig.2 of @xcite , indicating that sn2003hv is located at the edge of the distribution of normal sneia , close to sne 1986 g and 1993l .",
    "the value of @xmath6  that would be obtained from the fit shown in figure 2 of @xcite is @xmath13mag .",
    "the photometric value ( @xmath6  @xmath39mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is different but not inconsistent , given the large dispersion of the relation shown in @xcite .",
    "however , sn2003hv stands out because it shows a much larger ratio of the bluer , fe  iii - dominated line near 4700  over the redder , fe  ii - dominated one near 5200  ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "reddening towards sn2003hv is small .",
    "sne1989b and 1986 g are both highly reddened",
    "( @xmath40 and 0.60mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) , but even when this is corrected for a clear difference remains .",
    "the same is true if we compare sn2003hv with sn2004eo , which has a lower reddening ( @xmath41mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and similar line width .    a reasonable 1-zone model for the optical spectrum of sn2003hv",
    "is obtained for a @xmath15ni  mass of @xmath42 and is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this is actually rather a large value for the sn decline rate : for sn2004eo , with @xmath6@xmath43mag , @xcite found m(@xmath15ni ) @xmath44 .",
    "however , this value is consistent with the estimate of @xcite based on the luminosity at peak .",
    "the main reason for the large @xmath15ni  mass is indeed the need to fit the strong fe  iii  emission .",
    "the large fe  iii / fe  ii  ratio ( @xmath45 ) which characterizes the model is obtained assuming that no stable @xmath18fe  is present in the centre .",
    "this isotope acts only as a coolant and its effect is to reduce the ionization of fe .",
    "not introducing stable fe keeps the ionization ratio high .",
    "co and ni have a similar ionization state as fe .",
    "intermediate - mass elements ( ime ) are more highly ionized .",
    "the mass used in the model within 8000 km  s@xmath2  is only @xmath46 , which is less than in 1-zone models for the other sne ( e.g. , sn2004eo requires @xmath47 within 7300 km  s@xmath2 ) and significantly less than the prediction of w7 ( @xmath48 , * ? ? ?",
    "so , in the 1-zone model , sn2003hv has a small mass at low velocities , and most of it seems to have been burned to @xmath15ni .",
    "although the 1-zone model does a reasonable job of reproducing the optical spectrum , it can be seen to fail already in the reddest part : the [ fe  ii ] emission lines redwards of @xmath49  are overestimated .",
    "this becomes even worse in the near - ir , as is shown in figure 2 .",
    "there are therefore several different lines of evidence indicating that sn2003hv may not conform with the norm of sneia .",
    "this can be further studied using stratified models .          in the stratified version",
    ", our nebular code can be used to test specific explosion models , or , as we do here , to construct a best - fitting density - abundance distribution by fitting observations .",
    "@xcite fitted the late - time spectra of 23 sneia of different luminosities using the density distribution of w7 .",
    "they changed the @xmath15ni  content by modifying the outer extent of this species , as guided by the width of the observed nebular lines of fe .",
    "they found that not only the mass and distribution of @xmath15ni  correlates with the luminosity : evidence that the distribution of ime such as silicon and sulphur is complementary to that of nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) material suggests that most of the material which is not burned to fe - group elements must have been burned to ime .",
    "this supports the notion of a common mass for all sneia , or at least for most of them , excluding perhaps 1991bg - like events @xcite .",
    "here we test whether the w7 density distribution can be compatible with sn2003hv .",
    "the w7 model @xcite was created to fit the basic properties of average sneia .",
    "the underlying assumption is that sneia result from the deflagration of chandrasekhar - mass c - o white dwarfs .",
    "we now know that this is at best a secondary channel to the production of sneia @xcite",
    ". however , the density - velocity distribution of w7 is representative of typical snia explosions : delayed detonation models are indeed very similar @xcite .",
    "using the w7 density structure , and modifying only the abundances as in @xcite , it is possible to get a reasonable fit of the optical spectrum of sn2003hv ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this model has m(@xmath15ni)@xmath50 , similar to the 1-zone model .",
    "@xmath15ni  is located between 2000 and 10000 km  s@xmath2 , with abundances peaking at @xmath51% at 5000 - 7000 km  s@xmath2   ( figure 3 ) .",
    "stable @xmath18fe  is located only in the innermost region , below 4000 km  s@xmath2 : the total mass of @xmath18feis @xmath52 , as in w7 @xcite .",
    "ime must already be present as deep as @xmath53 km  s@xmath2  and become dominant above @xmath54 km  s@xmath2 , otherwise the mass of @xmath15ni  would be too large and the fe lines too broad .",
    "regions above 10000 km  s@xmath2  are not sensitive to the nebular treatment as their density is too low .",
    "the synthetic spectrum basically reproduces the results of @xcite , showing that the two codes give consistent results .",
    "while the blue part of the spectrum reproduces sn2003hv , the emission lines in the red part of the optical spectrum as well as in the near - ir are obviously too strong ( figure 2 ) .",
    "most of the lines in those regions are due to [ fe  ii ] . the strongest features in the bluer part of the optical spectrum , on the other hand",
    ", are either dominated by [ fe  iii ] ( the line near 4700 ) or have a non - negligible [ fe  iii ] contribution ( the line near 5200 ) .",
    "this suggests that the ionization degree of fe is too low in the model .",
    "this can not be improved as long as the high central density that characterizes w7 is kept .",
    "another reason for the low ionization is that in the inner part of the ejecta stable fe - group isotopes dominate .",
    "the role of these isotopes is only that of a coolant . replacing stable fe - group isotopes with @xmath15ni  would increase the ionization because of the added heating , but it would also lead to an increase of the luminosity . replacing them with ime would further increase the [ fe  ii]-[si  i ] line near @xmath55 m , which is already too strong ( figure 2 ) , and replacing them with oxygen would cause an emission line due to [ o  i ] 6300 , 6363  @xcite , which is not observed . in any case",
    ", none of these changes would be justified by explosion physics , since some neutron - rich material should be synthesised at the high central density of a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf .",
    "@xcite suggest that if the inner ejecta were clumped the lack of near - ir radiation may be explained because cooling would be less efficient than in the absence of clumping .",
    "our code allows the simulation of clumping in density : if we define a filling factor @xmath56 , the gas is assumed to be concentrated in clumps which fill a fraction @xmath57 of the volume .",
    "we tested a density clumping scenario with a moderate filling factor of 0.5 , which does not affect the @xmath22-ray deposition .",
    "the result of this is that the higher density in the clumps actually favours recombination , and further decreases the fe  iii / fe  ii  ratio . a model with clumping",
    "is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is still characterised by a high ratio of near - ir to optical flux .",
    "therefore , moderate clumping in density is unlikely to explain the observations of sn2003hv .",
    "since there seems to be no solution for the spectrum of sn2003hv using a w7 density , we next investigate whether different density structures might lead to better results .",
    "the advantage of modelling nebular - phase spectra of sneia is that photoionization can be , to a first approximation , neglected in the iron core ( see section 2 ) .",
    "combined with the homologous expansion of the sn ejecta , this makes nebular spectroscopy a very powerful tool .",
    "if the properties ( density and abundances ) of a certain velocity shell are modified while the rest of the nebula is left unaffected it is possible to derive the properties of that specific velocity shell .",
    "thus we can test in a rather uncomplicated way whether modifications in the density structure can lead to an ionization ratio which favours fe  iii  more than w7 does .",
    "qualitatively , in order to increase the ionization of the gas the recombination rate should be reduced , which could be achieved with lower densities .",
    "alternatively , the ionization rate should be increased , which can be obtained by reducing the ratio of stable versus radioactive nse elements .",
    "this suggests that the density in the regions where the lines are emitted may be smaller than in w7 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that this may best be achieved by reducing the content of stable nse material , as already found in the one - zone model ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "therefore we arbitrarily decreased the w7 density in the inner part of the ejecta , where the emission lines are produced .",
    "this was achieved mostly by removing stable nse material .",
    "the outer layers , which can not be probed in the nebular phase because their density is too low , were left as in w7 . at every step , we also modified the abundances in order to obtain as good a match to the data as possible , both in the optical and , in particular , in the near - ir .",
    "we modelled the optical / near - ir spectrum , now rescaled to a common epoch of day 355 after @xmath7 maximum following @xcite .",
    "the modified model has only @xmath58 of material with @xmath59 km  s@xmath2 . in w7 ,",
    "this is @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting synthetic spectrum is shown in figures 4 and 5 ( red line ) .",
    "as expected , we indeed find that when a reduced density is used the ionization degree is increased with respect to the w7-based model ( fig.4 , green line ) .",
    "this leads to a reduced flux in the red and the near - ir , which is the main result we tried to achieve . at the same time",
    ", the increased ionization causes the [ fe  iii ] 4700  line to become somewhat stronger with respect to the 5200  line , where both [ fe  iii ] and [ fe  ii ] lines contribute .",
    "the ratio of these two fe lines is not perfectly reproduced , as we tried to obtain a synthetic spectrum that reproduced the observed one as well as possible over a wide wavelength range .",
    "a major deficiency is the line near 4300 which is much too weak . a synthetic [ fe  ii ] line at 4416  is present , but it is not very strong .",
    "[ fe  ii ] 6555  is also too weak .",
    "increasing the strength of those lines would lead to the overestimate of other [ fe  ii ] lines , as in @xcite .",
    "the emission line near 1.6@xmath61 m does not show a flat top : this would require a three - dimensional study ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since this and other features characterized by a flat top are peculiarly blueshifted in the data @xcite . in our model @xmath22 rays deposit in the central zone , and",
    "flat tops are not expected .",

    "our model probably somewhat underestimates both the @xmath15ni  mass and the mass at low velocities , for two reasons .",

    "the missing mid - ir flux is probably caused by atomic transitions at energies of about 0.1 ev and less , which are responsible for mid - ir emission but are partially missing in the nebular code . since an increase in flux",
    "can be obtained by increasing either the mass of @xmath15ni  or the total emitting mass ( in both cases the energy deposited in the nebula increases ) , both the @xmath15ni  mass and the emitting mass ( within 10000 km  s@xmath2 ) could be increased by a factor @xmath77 . since our model has an emitting mass of @xmath78 within 10000 km  s@xmath2 , when this correction is applied we get an emitting mass of @xmath79 . as for the @xmath15ni  mass , in our models we obtained @xmath62 .",

    "@xcite suggest various possibilities to explain this discrepancy , including an early near - ir catastrophe which causes the flux to shift to the far - ir .",

    "on the other hand , our model with a reduced mass at low velocity is capable of reproducing the late - time flux for a @xmath15ni  mass similar to what @xcite find from the late light curve .",
    "this leaves open the question of why such different @xmath15ni  masses can be derived from the early and the late data , which usually are in good agreement @xcite .",
    "although arnett s rule may not be highly accurate , a factor of 2 difference is a large discrepancy .",
    "we suggest that a simple solution to the problem can be found if the density in the inner part of the ejecta is reduced .",

    "since we could derive the distribution of @xmath15ni  from the nebular spectra only , we have not included any @xmath15ni  at @xmath121 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "if some @xmath15ni  was present at higher velocities , the rising part of the light curve would be smoother , and the peak may be reached a little earlier .",

    "the reason for the rapid rise is that not only the inner ejecta have low density , and that the total mass of fe - group species is quite small ( @xmath124 ) , which keeps the opacity low .",

    "although what we have used here is by no means a realistic explosion model , the result that we obtained is nevertheless suggestive .",
    "the high ionization and low near - ir flux in the nebular phase of sn2003hv can be best explained if this snia ejected less mass at low velocities than in standard single - degenerate , chandrasekhar - mass explosion models . in particular ,",
    "the mass of stable nse elements is greatly reduced .",
    "the smaller mass may lead to a short rise time , which would also solve the apparent inconsistency between the @xmath15ni  mass derived from the peak of the light curve and the nebular epoch .",
    "therefore , the @xmath15ni  mass obtained from the peak luminosity using a relation which has been calibrated for a rise time of 19 days may be incorrect .",
    "two alternative scenarios exist to the single - degenerate , chandrasekhar - mass one .",

    "this involves a co white dwarf accreting he from a companion and an edge - lit explosion @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated light curves of sub - chandrasekhar models which do not consider how the explosion is triggered .",
    "their more massive models predict risetimes of @xmath126 days .",
    "in those models , however , fe - group elements are much more abundant than in the model we have derived , which is likely to result in a larger optical opacity .",
    "their least massive model ( @xmath127 ) has a risetime of 14 days , which is comparable to our result . in this model",
    "@xmath15ni  is more concentrated towards the centre than the distribution we have derived for sn2003hv ( fig.7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) , and the kinetic energy is smaller ( @xmath128erg compared to @xmath129erg ) .",
    "the diffusion time of optical photons may therefore be comparable in sn2003hv despite the slightly larger mass .",
    "the other scenario is the merging of two white dwarfs @xcite , and in particular the case of dynamical mergers @xcite .",
    "this results in an explosion ejecting at least a chandrasekhar mass , but the two merging white dwarfs had mass smaller than the chandrasekhar mass , and consequently lower central densities .",
    "this is reflected in the density distribution of the sn ejecta .    in fig .",

    "the exact incidence of sne with a non - standard origin is not known . in most sneia",
    ", optical nebular spectra do not suggest a high fe  iii / fe  ii  ratio .",
    "a dominance of fe  iii  over fe  ii  is deduced also in the innermost core of sn1991bg , for which an improved fit to a series of nebular spectra can also be obtained by slightly reducing the mass at low velocities ( mazzali et al .",

    "a possibility is that all sneia at the dim end of the distribution are the result of non - standard explosions , possibly of sub - chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs .",
    "the final question is whether the unexpectedly low near - ir flux , which is one of the characteristics that leads to a low mass estimate for sn2003hv , is typical of other sneia .",
    "late - time near - ir spectroscopy is available only for two other sneia , 2003du and 2005w @xcite .",
    "there are also a couple of photometric observations in the near - ir , for sne2000cx and 2001el @xcite . in both of these cases ,",
    "the ratio of near - ir to optical flux indicated a lower near - ir flux than expected from standard models like w7 .",
    "while it is possible that other sne may be accommodated in scenarios where the inner mass is reduced with respect to classical models based on this evidence , we refrain from making that suggestion here .",
    "near - ir and mid - ir spectrophotometry would be required to be more confident about any such statement .",
    "in particular , sn2000cx was very bright , indicating that most of the inner part of the white dwarf progenitor had been burned to nse .",
