    "recent years have witnessed exciting developments both in the observations and theoretical modelling of the abundance star to star variations within most of the well studied globular clusters ( gcs ) . in most gcscen ,",
    "in which the heavy elements spread and the hr diagram morphologies clearly show that we are dealing with several stellar generations , enriched by the supernova ejecta . ] only the light elements that are susceptible to abundance changes from proton - capture reactions , such as the pp , cn , on , nena , and mgal cycles , exhibit star - to - star abundance variations , far in excess of the modest dispersion seen in halo field stars  see , e.g. , @xcite , kraft ( 1994 ) , sneden ( 1999 ) , @xcite .",
    "observations of these abundance spreads at the turnoff and among the subgiant stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that these anomalies must be attributed indeed to some process of self  enrichment occurring at the first stages of the life of the cluster .",
    "the massive agb envelopes are the ideal place to manifacture elements through nuclear reactions in which proton captures are involved , as , especially for low metallicity , they are subject to hot bottom burning ( hbb ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the convective envelope reaches the hydrogen burning shell , and the products of burning are convected to the surface of the star and are given back to the intracluster medium by means of the stellar wind and the planetary nebula ejection .    today , the most popular explanation of the observed chemical anomalies , first proposed by cottrell & dacosta ( 1981 ) and dantona",
    ", gratton & chieffi ( 1983 ) , and recently adapted , is that these winds , collected in the central regions of the cluster , initiate a second stage of more or less continuous star formation lasting not more than 200myr .",
    "this model , which we will now call the _ standard self enrichment scenario _",
    ", received * an interesting hint * by the interpretation of some peculiar horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies in terms of helium enrichment of the gas from which a fraction of stars were born @xcite .",
    "the chemical anomalies are correlated with the hb morphology ( e.g. catelan & freitas pacheco 1995 ) , and high helium abundances ( which are also found in the envelopes of the massive agbs subject to hbb ) seem to be the best explanation for the hb blue tails and for the peculiar blue main sequences in @xmath2cen @xcite and in ngc2808 @xcite .    in spite of the appealing features of the standard self ",
    "enrichment scenario , a quantitative reproduction of the observed abundance spreads mainly of the oxygen vs. sodium and of the aluminum versus magnesium anticorrelations , for which abundant data are given in the recent astronomical literature is not available @xcite . in the recent literature",
    "indeed it is stated that quantitative considerations reveal a number of serious problems and  the current theoretical yields and chemical evolution models do not favour the agb pollution scenario ( with intermediate - mass agbs ) as the mechanism responsible for star - to - star abundance variations in globular clusters \" @xcite or that  the notion that massive agb stars are the origin of the o  na abundance anticorrelation in gc giants is not consistent with the model predictions of this study \" @xcite .",
    "most of these problems , however , are present in the computations which rest on mlt standard stellar models of low convective efficiency , due to which the hbb temperatures are not large enough to allow efficient on cycling .",
    "the recent models by @xcite , who indeed take care of developping an entire chemical evolution model , fail to reproduce the o ",
    "na anticorrelation and most of the other chemical anomalies mainly due to this choice of convection modelling . by tradition",
    ", our group adopts the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) model by @xcite , whose high efficiency allows strong on cycling .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown in detail that the modelization of the nuclear yields is enormously dependent on the efficiency of the adopted convection model and , indirectly , on the efficiency of mass loss .",
    "some problems of other modellers , e.g. the high increase in the cno total abundances , which _ is not _ found in the observations @xcite , is in fact due to the high number of third dredge up ( tdu ) episodes , due to the comparatively low luminosity of the models with respect to the luminosity of the fst models . in spite of this improvement , our most recent models @xcite reproduce in a satisfactory way the o  na anticorrelation only for a limited range of masses ( 3.5 - 4.5 ) , and are not consistent with the mg - al anticorrelation .    in this paper , we show that we can modify our models in order to solve these problems , and thus we are closer to the complete solution of this appealing conundrum .",
    "the guide - line of this study was to build agb stellar models whose ejecta are consistent with the chemistry of the most contaminated stars within gcs , i.e. : a ) strong enhancement of aluminum and fluorine ; b ) a positive yield of sodium ; c ) a large depletion of oxygen ; d ) a ( c+n+o ) sum increased by no more than a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the correlation of sodium with aluminum , and the anticorrelations of sodium versus oxygen and fluorine , can all be reproduced by assuming a modest extra - mixing from the base of the convective envelope in addition to a very efficient convection model .",
    "we focus our attention on a typical massive agb model , of mass m=5 ; the adopted chemistry is ( z , y)=(0.001,0.24 ) . the complete description of the physics of the models is given in @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of the production of elements during the agb evolution requires computation of complete stellar models including nuclear processing by hbb , coupled with non  instantaneous mixing .",
    "we adopt a network of 30 isotopes from hydrogen to silicon .",
    "the standard cross sections adopted in the code are from @xcite .",
    "the abundances we adopt in the computation are solar scaled , due to the present limitation of opacities and equation of state in our code . actually , the @xmath4 elements in popii stars are enhanced by @xmath5 dex ( e.g. gratton , sneden & carretta 2004 ) , and the initial value of cno abundances affect the detailed nucleosynthesis .",
    "however we have made test models concerning the important oxygen abundance bahaviour , showing that the logarithmic decrease of oxygen abundance is roughly the same .",
    "consequently , if we had started , e.g. , from an oxygen overabundance of + 0.3dex , the final abundance would have been 0.3dex larger than that found in our model .",
    "convection is modelled according to the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) treatment by @xcite , which provides at the bottom of the convective envelopes temperature larger than the corresponding mlt models with @xmath6 @xcite .    the standard mass loss law adopted in our models ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) is from @xcite , who modifies the reimer s formula in order to simulate the strong mass loss suffered by these stars as they climb along the agb .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter in this formulation is set to 0.02 .",
    "the strong depletion of oxygen needed to match the observed abundances of the bulk of the stars showing chemical anomalies in gcs ( @xmath8 dex ) requires very high temperatures at the base of the external envelope , that can be hardly achieved in the framework of the mlt modelling of convection ; the recent observations of giant stars in m4 @xcite , indicating a strong fluorine depletion ( @xmath9 dex ) , also point towards the same direction .",
    "the problem most difficult to overcome is that models depleting oxygen destroy sodium as well @xcite .",
    "when an efficient tdu is invoked , the sodium abundance can increase by even a factor of @xmath10 , that is at odds with the highest observed value in the m13 giants ( @xmath11 dex ) ; besides , in these same models the ( c+n+o ) sum would be much larger than observed . as discussed , the models by @xcite reproduced the oxygen depletion and sodium enhancement only for a small range of masses .",
    "in addition , the range of @xmath12 enhancement was a major problem of these models .",
    "we investigate now the effects that a small amount of extra - mixing from the base of the convective envelope might have on the chemistry of the ejecta , by assuming that convective velocities decay exponentially inwards beyond the formal border fixed by the schwartzschild criterion .",
    "the difference between the present model and the model of the same mass presented in ventura & dantona ( 2005b ) is that the parameter @xmath13 connected with the extra - mixing is not set to zero , but is allowed to vary between @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the value used to simulate overshooting from the border of the convective core of intermediate mass stars during the phase of h - burning , that was calibrated in order to reproduce the observed main sequences of open clusters ( ventura et al .",
    "1998 ) .    figs .",
    "[ ejecta1 ] and [ ejecta2 ] show the evolution ( in terms of variation with mass , that is obviously decreasing with time ) of the surface abundances of some key - elements of 5models calculated with different @xmath13 s .",
    "first , we note that large depletion of oxygen and fluorine can be easily achieved when the fst treatment is used for convection modelling .",
    "we also confirm , ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ ejecta1 ] , solid line ) that sodium can not be produced if a straight schwartzschild criterion is used to locate the base of the surface convection .",
    "conversely , if some extra - mixing is assumed , the surface sodium increases following each tp , due to the dredge - up of @xmath16 , later converted to @xmath17 ; this holds particularly during the latest evolutionary stages , when the temperature at the base of the surface convective region is decreased by mass loss .",
    "another bonus of these models is that the small total number of tps prevents from obtaining a final sodium abundance largely exceeding the initial value .",
    "[ ejecta1 ] ( right panel ) shows that the larger is @xmath13 the larger is the oxygen content of the ejecta , as this latter element can also be dredged - up following each tp if the base of the convective envelope penetrates deeply into the ashes of the former @xmath18 shell .",
    "we find that a value @xmath19 leads to ejecta whose chemical composition is both sodium rich ( @xmath20=+0.4 $ ] ) and oxygen poor ( @xmath21=-0.55 $ ] ) , and can thus take account of the observed anticorrelation sodium versus oxygen .",
    "the use of @xmath22 leads to a dredge - up parameter @xmath23 gradually increasing along the agb evolution , that reaches a maximum value of @xmath24 at the latest tps .",
    "* this , combined with the small number of tps in which tdu is achieved ( @xmath25 ) , makes the mass @xmath26 of the processed material to be @xmath27 ; we therefore expect a negligible effect on the s - process elements abundances . *    the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ejecta2 ] also shows that a strong depletion of fluorine is achieved in all cases ; the mass expelled by the @xmath22 model has @xmath28 \\sim -1.2 $ ] , a result that is in agreement with the analysis by smith et al . ( 2005 ) regarding the fluorine abundance variations in red giants of m4 ( see their fig.4 ) .",
    "the central panel shows that when using the higher limit of the nacre rates for @xmath29 and @xmath30 proton capture reactions it is also possible to achieve a strong @xmath12 production , ( @xmath31 = + 0.7 $ ] ) independently of @xmath13 ; this can not be obtained when we adopt the recommended nacre cross sections ( long - dashed line ) . finally , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ejecta2 ] shows the evolution of the total ( c+n+o ) abundance , with respect to the initial value .",
    "we see that the model calculated with @xmath22 achieves a maximum final abundance increased by a factor of @xmath32 , and the average increase is @xmath33 , that is still consistent with the observations .",
    "* concerning the magnesium isotopic ratios , the ejecta of our model have @xmath34 and @xmath35 , both sensibly greater than the values ( @xmath36 ) observed by yong et al.(2005 ) in the most polluted stars of ngc6752 : we recall , however , that the theoretical estimate of relative abundances of the magnesium isotopes is affected by the uncertainties related to the cross section of the reactions of proton and @xmath4 captures by the heavy magnesium isotopes , and the @xmath4 captures by @xmath16 nuclei . *",
    "in this work we present results of detailed calculations focused on the agb phase of a typical intermediate mass star ( m@xmath37 ) of metallicity @xmath38 .",
    "our main finding is that when the fst model is used to deal with convective modelling , the use of a modest amount of extra - mixing at the base of the outer convective envelope leads to ejecta whose chemical composition reproduces simultaneously most of the chemical anomalies observed in gcs stars .      1 .",
    "oxygen and fluorine are strongly depleted : we find @xmath21=-0.55 $ ] and @xmath28=-1.2 $ ] .",
    "when the high nacre limit for the rates of the proton capture reactions by the heavy magnesium isotopes are used , aluminum can be easily manifactured : @xmath31=+0.7 $ ] .",
    "3 .   a modest amount of extra - mixing at the base of the convective envelope ( @xmath22 , to be compared with the value @xmath15 that must be used in our models to increase the convective core extension during h - burning , to fit the observed open cluster main - sequences ) triggers some @xmath16 to be dredged - up following each tp ; when the pulse is extinguished , this fresh @xmath16 is converted in sodium , that in the latest evolutionary stages , when the temperature at the base of the convective envelope is reduced by mass loss , can survive to proton fusion .",
    "the overall sodium content of the ejecta is @xmath39=+0.4 $ ] 4 .",
    "the total ( c+n+o ) abundance , due both to the small number of tps and to the modest efficiency of the tdu , is increase by only a factor of @xmath33 , that is also consistent with the observations .",
    "the present results give more robustness to the current interpretation that the chemical anomalies among gc stars result from star formation in the intracluster medium polluted by the ejecta of an early generation of massive agbs .",
