    "the search space is large which increases the computational complexity of the matching process .",
    "numerous techniques have been proposed in literature to make the matching process fast .",
    "based on the search accuracy , these approaches may be broadly divided into approximate accuracy and exhaustive accuracy techniques .",
    "the first category obtains fast speedup at the cost of some loss of accuracy and often incorporates one or more approximations . for example",
    ", the search space may be approximated with a smaller search space , the target may be approximated with a simple representation , or the similarity measure approximated with a simpler measure .",
    "the exhaustive accuracy techniques obtain fast speedup without losing accuracy .",
    "this category includes domain transformation techniques using fft and bound based computation elimination algorithms in which unsuitable search locations are skipped from computations . in this paper",
    "we argue on maintaining exhaustive accuracy in the proposed algorithm which skips unsuitable search locations based on bound comparisons . to make the process fast ,",
    "the search image is processed in a controlled way to avoid any loss of accuracy .",
    "bound based computation elimination algorithms are exhaustive accuracy fast template matching techniques . most of these algorithms are based on the sum of absolute differences ( sad ) or the sum of squared differences ( ssd )  @xcite .",
    "elimination algorithms using similarity measures invariant to the intensity and contrast variations such as normalized cross correlation ( ncc ) or correlation coefficient ( @xmath0 ) ( or zero - mean ncc ) are relatively few including  @xcite .",
    "algorithms in this category are the main focus of this paper . in most of the remote sensing applications ,",
    "the images to be matched are acquired at different time of the day , often with significant time lag . therefore simple measures like sad and ssd are more vulnerable to errors as compared to the correlation coefficient .",
    "correlation coefficient @xmath1 ( or zncc ) is more robust to the linear photo - metric variations between the two images to be matched .",
    "correlation coefficient between template image @xmath2 and a location in search image @xmath3 is denoted as @xmath4 and defined as @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the means of @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "if @xmath9 are two shifted blocks in the same image , then @xmath10 in will represent local auto - correlation with a shift @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we use local auto - correlation to speedup the matching process .",
    "local auto - correlation is enhanced by inducing controlled non - uniform image blur in the search images . as a result",
    ", we obtain high matching speed with a robust match measure .    in the category of correlation coefficient",
    "based fast template matching algorithms , we consider transitive algorithm ( tea )  @xcite mainly because this algorithm gives the opportunity to incorporate non - uniform blur to obtain high speed template matching .",
    "also tea has been shown to be faster than the previous algorithms of the same category  @xcite .",
    "however , tea can not be directly used for this purpose because the design parameters of this algorithm are currently user defined .",
    "especially the group size parameter and the initial threshold .",
    "we develop an efficient group size ( egs ) algorithm which maximizes an estimation of the the eliminated computations over group size parameter .",
    "we then incorporate egs algorithm within a novel algorithm for optimization of auto - correlation ( opta ) which computes non - uniformly blurred search image . a scheme for early detection of the high initial threshold is also proposed .",
    "all these algorithms combined with tea make a fast template matching system which has the same accuracy as the original algorithm but obtains significant speedup .",

    "@xmath57 remains fixed for a particular group size @xmath12 and can be reduced by increasing the group size .",
    "this is the cost of computing the correlation at the locations with failed sufficient elimination condition : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the number of retained locations . as the group size increases the within group auto - correlation reduces due to increased distance between @xmath16 and @xmath3 .",
    "as a result , the transitive bound becomes loose , causing the sufficient elimination condition to fail more often and an increase in @xmath60 .",

    ".average percent computation elimination on the si and ai datasets [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : elim ]    the proposed algorithm ( opta ) is also compared with amwu  @xcite . for this comparison , we prepared two new ai datasets with template sizes @xmath230 and @xmath231 , because amwu requires the template dimensions to be in the powers of 2 . for the ai reference of size 1549@xmath1732389 , amwu is more than an order of magnitude slower than our proposed algorithm .",
    "amwu is much efficient on the small search space @xmath232  @xcite , however for the large search space , its performance degrades probably significantly long lists of the temporary winners make the hashing scheme inefficient .    among the two datasets , opta obtained more speed up on the ai dataset mainly because it contains significant details and high frequency contents .",
    "opta was able to induce blurring at most of the ai reference image locations without loss of image quality .",
    "less speedup on si dataset is because a big portion of si reference image is sea , having no details .",
    "opta was not able to blur that portion because blurring caused image quality degradation .    in both datasets ground truth",
    "was manually marked and a match was considered correct if it was within @xmath233 pixels of the ground truth location . using this criterion , opta and egs exhibited 100% accuracy on all datasets while sad has an average accuracy of 81.0% over ai and 76.11% over si datasets .",
    "maximum speedup of opta over sad with sea and pde is 26.93 times .",
    "although more efficient implementations of sad exist , however accuracy of sad can not be improved over the exhaustive accuracy .",
    "a fast template matching system was proposed to find a target in a large search space .",
    "fast match speedup was obtained by inducing non uniform blur in the search space .",
    "exhaustive math accuracy was ensured by maintaining a minimum image quality at all locations .",
    "for this purpose an optimal auto - correlation ( opta ) algorithm was proposed .",
    "opta algorithm was based on efficient group size ( egs ) algorithm which made the transitive elimination algorithm more efficient .",
    "moreover , a technique for early detection of the high initial threshold was also proposed .",
    "the fast template matching system was compared with six existing algorithms on two different datasets .",
