    "domain wall motion in ferromagnetic nanostrips has attracted much attention in recent years due to its potential applications in magnetic memory devices @xcite and magnetic logic gates @xcite .",
    "these applications require a detailed and deep understanding of dw motion so that one could have a better control of magnetization states .",
    "although field driven dw motion have been extensively studied @xcite in the last few decades and lots of interesting phenomena have been found , there are still many fundamental processes poorly understood .",
    "for example , field driven dw dynamics is governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation which has a well - known walker exact rigid - body propagation solution @xcite for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) biaxial wire .",
    "however , simulations or experiments on the field driven dw motion are often not described by the walker solution @xcite . for quasi-1d nanostrips with narrow width",
    ", transverse dw is a preferred low energy state @xcite as shown in figs .",
    "1a and 1b without ( 1a ) and with ( 1b ) the magnetostatic interaction .",
    "the magnetostatic field plays such an important role in the dw structure that the width of dw varies in the transverse direction , leading to a strawberry - like dw ( fig .",
    "although similar shaped dw has already been known numerically @xcite , its consequences and connections with other dw dynamics phenomena such as antivortex generation and reduction of the walker breakdown field have not been thoroughly investigated , and this is the main focus of this work .    in this paper we explore the consequences of the strawberry - like transverse dw on field driven dw dynamics in ferromagnetic nanostrips . when the field is larger than a certain value but substantially below the usual walker breakdown field ,",
    "a series of dw structure transformations , including periodic birth and death of antivortices , is observed and explained .",
    "two types of antivortex evolutions and their causes are identified . a phase diagram in the field - width plane",
    "is also obtained numerically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our model and method is described in the next section .",
    "an explanation of why magnetostatic interaction should give rise to a strawberry - like transverse dw is also provided in section ii .",
    "numerical results on the antivortex generation and its afterward evolution are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in section iv , followed by the acknowledgments .",
    "our model is a head - to - head dw in magnetic nanostrips of @xmath0 nm long , @xmath1 nm thick , and width varying from @xmath2 nm to @xmath3 nm . the magnetization dynamics of nanostrips is governed by the llg equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the unit vector of magnetization @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath8 is the phenomenological gilbert damping constant .",

    "@xmath12 is the effective field measured in the units of @xmath13 , which includes the exchange field described by the exchange constant @xmath14 , crystalline anisotropy field @xmath15 , magnetostatic field @xmath16 and applied field @xmath17 .",
    "the film lies in @xmath18plane with the origin at the center of the strip .",
    "@xmath19 is along the longitudinal direction with @xmath20 in the width ( transverse ) direction and @xmath21-axis along the thickness direction .",
    "permalloy parameters are used in the simulations with @xmath22j / m , saturation magnetization @xmath23a / m and negligible crystalline anisotropy field .",
    "damping constant is chosen to be @xmath24 to accelerate the simulation .",
    "the llg equation is numerically solved by the micromagnetic package oommf @xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "the mesh size is chosen to be 4nm@xmath254nm@xmath254 nm where 4 nm is about 0.7 of exchange length @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the static dw is transverse @xcite for the types of strips in the current investigations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which is numerically obtained from an initial configuration of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 for a head - to - head dw , and parameter @xmath30 is close to the static dw width .",
    "when the magnetostatic interaction includes only the shape anisotropy , but neglects all contributions from the non - uniform magnetization distribution , the final dw is homogeneous in which dw width is @xmath31independent and the net magnetic moments point up ( polarity @xmath32 @xcite ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . when all the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction is included in the magnetostatic interaction , the magnetostatic field generated by the magnetic charges along the edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) shall modify the effective magnetic anisotropy such that a typical dw shape is strawberry - like as shown in fig .",
    "specifically , the @xmath31component of edge charges field tends to reduce the anisotropy field in the direction while its @xmath33component lowers the anisotropy field near upper edge and enhances the @xmath33component of the field near the lower edge .",
    "because the decrease of anisotropy leads to the increase of dw width , this anisotropy modification gives rise to the strawberry - like dw that closely follow the field lines , as shown in fig .",

    "the dw centre line must tilt and stretch due to the speed mismatch and the exchange interaction , creating a large magnetization gradient near the tail of the centre line .",
    "complicated changes could happen such as antivortex generation and reduction of the walker breakdown field .",

    "we use a magnetic strip of width @xmath42 nm as an example to illustrate possible types of field - driven transverse wall motion .",
    "since the only anisotropy comes from sample shape in the model , the walker breakdown field is @xmath43oe @xcite , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are demagnetization factors along @xmath46 and @xmath31directions . for fields below @xmath47oe , the transverse wall propagates eventually like a rigid - body after a short transient process . when the field is greater than @xmath47oe , antivortex is generated and no rigid - body dw propagation is observed .",
    "the possible types of the antivortex evolution depend on field strength . for fields @xmath47oe@xmath48oe ,",

    "[ fig2]b at @xmath54ns after field is turned on , a small antivortex ( blue dot ) is born at the edge defect on the bottom edge , the tail of dw centre line . since the defects are topological objects with well - defined winding numbers @xcite , edge defect of @xmath52 winding number can only give a birth to an antivortex of winding number @xmath34 and change its own winding number to a @xmath55 edge defect@xcite .",

    "this birth - death process of antivortices repeats periodically while the transverse dw propagates along the while with an averaged speed of about @xmath56 m/s .",

    "our study shows that the birth of antivortices arises from the motion of a strawberry - like dw caused by the anisotropy modification due to the magnetic charges of the dw . the uneven energy dissipation in the transverse direction due to the dw width variation leads to an uneven propagation speed along the direction .",
    "as a result , the dw centre line is elongated and tilted . a large magnetization gradient near the tail of the dw centre line",
    "is then produced and this gradient tends to generate antivortices near the tail of the line .",
    "it is clear that the walker rigid - body propagating mode applies only to a transverse dw ( bloch or neel type ) , not for an vortex or antivortex dw .",
    "this is because a vortex tends to move in the transverse direction under a gyrotropic force @xcite .",
    "a transversally moving vortex wall in a nanostrip must modify its own dw structure due to the edge charge effects .",
    "thus , dw propagating speed shall vary with time according to the connection between dw structure and instantaneous dw speed @xcite .",
    "thus , the antivortex birth invalidates the walker rigid - body propagating mode .",
    "this is why the walker breakdown field is substantially reduced in a strip .",
    "the actual amount of breakdown field reduction depends on the geometry and other material parameters . in general , the larger the strip width is , the greater reduction of the walker breakdown field will be .    in conclusion",
    ", we investigate field - driven dw propagation along magnetic strips below the predicted walker breakdown field .",
    "a strawberry - like dw causes reduction of walker breakdown field because of the antivortices generation .",
    "the walker rigid - body dw propagation mode is only possible at weak fields when a propagating dw does not create antivortices .",
    "if external fields are larger than a critical value , this strawberry - like dw generates antivortices at the tail of the dw centre line , and the antivortices move to the other side of strip and reverse the dw polarity .",
    "this process prefers to appear in narrower strips according to our simulation .",
    "if the field is further increased above another critical value , still below the walker breakdown field , the generated antivortex will not be able to reach the other edge of the strip , but detaches itself from the dw and vanishes eventually in a domain through energy dissipation .",
    "the original transverse dw does not change its polarity in this field range .",
    "it is noticed that motion of an inhomogeneous dw generates antivortices even in zero damping case whose details need further investigations .    hyy acknowledges the support of hong kong phd fellowship .",
