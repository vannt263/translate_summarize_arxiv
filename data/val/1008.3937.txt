    "several recent papers have proposed and explored the use of tensor networks to simulate fermionic lattice models in two spatial dimensions,@xcite including algorithms based on the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz@xcite ( mera ) and projected entangled - pair states.@xcite the fundamental ingredient , common to all approaches , is to incorporate fermionic statistics directly into the tensor network by regarding the tensors as linear maps of anticommuting degrees of freedom , an idea recently generalized to anyonic statistics.@xcite the main goal of fermionic tensor network methods is to address strongly correlated fermionic models , which suffer from the negative sign problem in quantum monte carlo.@xcite    fermionic peps were first proposed in ref .   and have been discussed in several other papers.@xcite in ref .",
    "we provided a detailed account of how to adapt existing bosonic peps algorithms to the fermionic case , and we used the fermionic version of the infinite peps algorithms@xcite to obtain benchmark results for three models with nearest - neighbor hamiltonian in an infinite square lattice : ( @xmath2 ) a model of free spinless fermions with a pairing potential , ( @xmath3 ) a model of interacting spinless fermions with a nearest - neighbor repulsion , and ( @xmath4 ) the well - known @xmath0-@xmath1 model . in the first case , a comparison of the numerical results with the exact solution showed that fermionic peps could reproduce ground - state energies and short - range correlators satisfactorily , with a larger degree of accuracy in gapped phases than in gapless ones . for the model of interacting spinless fermions , peps yielded significantly lower variational energies than obtained by mean - field theory ( restricted hartree - fock theory ) , which enabled to determine the phase diagram more accurately . for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ,",
    "peps energies are comparable ( or even better in some cases ) than variational monte carlo based on gutzwiller - projected ansatz wave functions .    as with any new approach ,",
    "systematic benchmarking of fermionic peps algorithms is important in order to establish their range of applicability .",
    "the results of ref .",
    ", while limited to three specific models , were a first step in this direction .",
    "a key question to be addressed is how good a fermionic peps is in practice , as a variational ansatz , at approximately representing the ground state of fermionic models .",
    "of course , the precise answer to this question will depend on the specific model under consideration .",
    "however , insight on how fermionic peps methods generally perform in certain circumstances , e.g. in a given gapped phase , may be obtained from models where an exact solution or previous numerical results by other methods are already available .",
    "such insight is essential in order to subsequently assess the validity of fermionic peps results obtained in more relevant ( and challenging ) scenarios , such as in exploring the ground state phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , which was addressed in ref .  , or of the hubbard model .",
    "thus , one of the main goals of this paper is to further benchmark the performance of fermionic peps algorithms , by considering more complex models than those addressed in ref .  .",
    "specifically , here we will consider the effect of adding nearest - neighbor hopping terms to the three models of ref .  .",
    "recall that in many cases of interest it is desirable to consider a model where fermion particles can hop between nearest - neighbor sites ( with amplitude @xmath0 ) as well as next - nearest neighbor sites ( with amplitude @xmath5 ) .",
    "for example , in effective models of high - t@xmath6 superconductors ( cuprates ) , it is estimated that the ratio @xmath7 is of the order of @xmath8.@xcite a finite @xmath5 can have several important effects on the system .",
    "for instance band - structure calculations@xcite and experimental analysis@xcite suggest that the highest @xmath9 strongly depends on @xmath10 .",
    "previous studies of the hole - doped @xmath0-@xmath5-@xmath1 model revealed that a finite @xmath11 can suppress magnetic order @xcite and enhance or suppress pairing correlations@xcite ( depending on the doping ) .",
    "it was also shown that @xmath5 influences the formation of stripes.@xcite in order to explore how well fermionic peps can reproduce such ground states , we need to extend the fermionic peps algorithm of ref .  ,",
    "based on simulating imaginary time evolution , to the case where the evolution is generated by a hamiltonian that also contains next - nearest neighbor terms .",
    "thus a second main goal of this paper is to explain how this is accomplished .",
    "the simulation of frustrated spin models with next - nearest neighbor terms with peps by imaginary time evolution was considered in ref .  .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , here we will explain how to generalize the so - called _ simple update _",
    "scheme for time evolution to the case of next - nearest neighbor terms ( in addition to accounting for the fermionic character of the peps ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we first explain how to update the peps during an imaginary time evolution in the presence of next - nearest neighbor hamiltonian terms .",
    "then we discuss how to evaluate the expectation value of a next - nearest neighbor operator , as required e.g. in order to compute the energy of a peps in the case of nearest neighbor hopping @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present a series of benchmark results for extensions , containing next - nearest neighbor hopping terms , of the three models addressed previously in ref .  , namely ( @xmath2 ) an exactly solvable model of free spinless fermions with @xmath12 , ( @xmath3 ) the @xmath0-@xmath5-@xmath13 model,@xcite and ( @xmath4 ) the @xmath0-@xmath5-@xmath1 model.@xcite the accuracy and/or apparent convergence ( as a function of bond dimension @xmath14 ) of ground state properties in these models are comparable to those previously obtained for the case @xmath15 . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our findings and conclusions . for completeness ,",
    "appendix [ app : ctm ] provides details on the two different corner - transfer - matrix ( ctm ) schemes used in order to evaluate expectation values from an infinite peps .",
    "as in ref .   for spin systems , we use an infinite peps with bond dimension @xmath14 to approximate the ground state of a hamiltonian defined on an infinite square lattice , by simulating an evolution in imaginary time starting from some ( random ) initial state .",
    "the evolution itself is first approximated , through a trotter - suzuki decomposition , by a sequence of two - site gates.@xcite after applying each two - site gate , the affected bond in the peps has to be truncated , so that the evolved state is again represented by a peps with the same bond dimension @xmath14 .",
    "this truncation implies choosing a @xmath14-dimensional subspace in the vector space associated to the bond index . in ref .",
    "we distinguished between two different truncation or update schemes .",
    "the first consists of choosing the subspace that best supports the wave function .",
    "this requires taking the whole peps wave - function into account during the update , i.e. the _ environment _ has to be computed at every step in the imaginary time evolution.@xcite alternatively , following refs .",
    ", one can update the peps as in the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method in one dimension@xcite by means of a singular value decomposition ( svd ) . in this second , simpler option , referred to as _ simple update _ , instead of considering the full environment , only local weights attached to the bonds of the peps are taken into account .",
    "in one dimensional systems with open boundary conditions , this choice of update is optimal , since the full environment can be encoded in the local weights . in two dimensional systems , however , the simple update is no longer optimal ( a better chose of truncated space can be obtained by considering the whole environment ) but it has a significantly lower computation cost as a function of bond dimension @xmath14 , which allows to consider larger bond dimensions ( in a suboptimal way ) and potentially obtain more accurate results with the same computational cost .    here",
    "we will use the simple update . in this section",
    "we first discuss the additional steps needed to apply the simple update of ref .",
    "in the case of a two - site gate acting on next - nearest neighbor sites .",

    "figure  [ fig : adu ] illustrates the update for the link between tensors @xmath20 and @xmath30 , via the tensor @xmath21 ( including all adjacent diagonal matrices @xmath18 ) .",
    "similarly one could also perform the update for the same link involving the tensor @xmath31 instead of @xmath21 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : otherupdates](a ) . in practice",
    "we apply the square root of the gate to both combinations of tensors , in order to make the update more symmetric . in principle",
    "it is conceivable that also the order in which the singular value decompositions are made plays a role .",
    "however , in the cases studied we have not found a significant difference when changing the order .",

    "firstly , we note that the complexity of the update can be reduced by splitting off the parts of the tensors involved in the update by a singular value decomposition ( see e.g. fig .  32 in ref .  ) .",
    "secondly , the same update may of course be used also for bosonic and spin systems , with the simplification that crossings do not need to be taken into account , since bosonic and spin operators commute . finally , note that an update for next - to - next nearest neighbor interaction can be implemented in a very similar way , since it also involves three peps tensors ( arranged on a line ) .",
    "this case , not further considered in the paper , requires a larger unit cell of size @xmath40 .      in order to compute the expectation value of a next - nearest neighbor operator ,",
    "one proceeds in a similar way as explained in sec .",
    "iii b of ref .   for nearest neighbor operators .",
    "first , one has to compute the environment @xmath41}$ ] for the tensors @xmath42 , which accounts for the infinite lattice surrounding the @xmath43 unit cell formed by these tensors . in ref .",
    "this was done with the directional corner transfer matrix ( ctm ) method.@xcite besides this scheme , in the present work we also use another variant of the ctm approach , as discussed in appendix  [ app : ctm ] .",
    "the ctm algorithm yields the four corner tensors @xmath44 and the eight edge tensors @xmath45 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adham ] , which altogether constitute the environment @xmath41}$ ] .",
    "next , one connects the four tensors @xmath42 together with their complex conjugates to the environment , and joins the physical legs to the operator accordingly , as exemplified in fig .",

    "[ fig : adham ] ) to the physical legs of @xmath16 and @xmath17 accordingly .",
    "finally , the expectation value of the remaining six next - nearest terms can be obtained analogously by first generating the environments for the plaquettes @xmath48 , [ { dc\\atop{ba } } ] , [ { cd\\atop{ab}}]$ ] .",

    "in this section we provide benchmark results for three fermionic models on an infinite square lattice with nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor hopping terms , with amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "each model is an extension of an analogous model with only nearest neighbor hopping term , that is with @xmath15 , previously addressed in ref .  .",
    "as initial condition , the tensors of the infinite peps are chosen randomly . in some cases",
    "we observe that the state resulting from the time evolution depends on the initial condition ( seed ) , which might be due to the local character of the simple update ( cf . sec .",
    "[ sec : simpleupdate ] ) .",
    "we therefore typically run several ( of the order of 10 ) simulations with different seeds , and pick the state with lowest energy . in some cases",
    "a good choice is to initialize a peps from a previously converged peps with smaller @xmath14 , but this does not always lead to the state with lowest energy .",
    "a converged peps for a certain hamiltonian usually provides a good initial condition for simulations with slightly different hamiltonian parameters , provided both states are in the same phase .",
    "evaluating the expectation value of observables requires computing an environment , which in turn requires introducing a second bond dimension @xmath49 associated to additional truncations .",

    "@xcite therefore , a peps is still expected to offer an accurate description of the ground state , provided certain bond dimension @xmath14 , in general larger than in the gapped case , is used .",
    "this category of states includes , for the free spinless fermion model , the gapless p - wave paired phase corresponding to small @xmath62 ; and , for the @xmath0-@xmath5-@xmath1 model , both the antiferromagnetic phase at half - filling and the ( expected ) d - wave paired phase in the doped case .",
    "a remarkable achievement of fermionic peps simulations is that they yield better or comparable energies than the usual gutzwiller projected ansatz wave functions for the doped @xmath0-@xmath5-@xmath1 model for @xmath56 .",
    "however , a larger bond dimension @xmath14 would be needed to attempt to match the energies of state - of - the - art fixed - node monte carlo ( fnmc).@xcite we note that even if the energy in such gapless phases is obtained with a few digits of accuracy ( of the order of @xmath101 for the model with @xmath55 ) , it is still unclear whether the peps reproduces other relevant properties of the ground state accurately . here we found that the correlation function for the free fermion model is satisfactorily reproduced for short - range distances .",
    "however , there are other known cases , e.g. the heisenberg antiferromagnet model , where the accuracy of the order parameter is two orders of magnitude worse than the accuracy of the energy for a @xmath102 peps on an infinite lattice.@xcite therefore , the reliability of peps results must be carefully checked on a case by case basis .",
    "nevertheless , and taking into account that there are no exact methods available to address systems of strongly correlated fermions , we believe that fermionic peps and , more generally , fermionic tensor networks , offer a useful approach to such systems that complements other approaches such as fixed - node monte carlo,@xcite diagrammatic monte carlo,@xcite cluster dynamical mean - field theory,@xcite or gaussian monte carlo.@xcite    _ gapless phases of type ii_.gapless systems with a 1d fermi surface , such as the metal phase of the interacting spinless fermion model , are known to display logarithmic multiplicative corrections to the area law of the entanglement entropy .",
    "this logarithmic violation can not be reproduced with a peps , and it is therefore unclear that fermionic peps methods will be able to accurately describe the ground state of such massively entangled phases . nonetheless",
    ", our results for the metal phase of the interacting spinless fermion model show that , even in this case , peps with increasing values of the bond dimension @xmath14 can be used to obtain systematic improvements on mean - field energies , which in turn question the validity of the mean - field phase diagram .",
    "it might well be , however , that a proper characterization of the ground state of gapless phases with a 1d fermi surface is simply beyond the reach of fermionic peps . in this case other techniques , such as one of the many methods which work particularly well in fermi - liquid type phases at weak coupling ( e.g. refs .  ) , or a specialized tensor network approach,@xcite should be used instead .",
    "we conclude by noticing that a larger bond dimension @xmath14 , and therefore more accurate peps results , may be within reach in subsequent studies .",
    "this larger values of @xmath14 could be accessed e.g. by using more computer resources ( possibly in a parallel architecture ) , by exploiting internal the symmetries of the the fermionic models@xcite ( e.g. particle conservation ) and/or by employing monte carlo sampling techniques.@xcite we also point out that with the same values of @xmath103 used in this paper , more accurate results may be obtained by employing the _ standard update _ instead of the _ simple update _ in the simulations , which , however , comes with a larger computational cost ( cf . ref .  ) .    _",

    "in an infinite system , corner transfer matrix ( ctm ) methods , originally introduced by baxter,@xcite can be used to approximately compute this environment . in this case , the environment is approximated by four corner tensors @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 and eight edge tensors ( or half - row transfer matrices ) @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adham ] .    in the present work we applied two different ctm schemes :",
    "the first is the directional ctm method,@xcite already used in our previous work;@xcite the second scheme essentially corresponds to the ctm renormalization group ( ctmrg ) method from ref .   adapted to the anisotropic case and to a @xmath43 unit cell , with subsequent coarse - graining moves in horizontal and vertical direction as in the directional ctm method .",
    "the main difference is that in the former scheme the four corners in the lattice are renormalized individually ( see refs .   for details ) , whereas in the ctmrg approach the full environment is taken into account in each renormalization step .",
    "figure  [ fig : nctm ] illustrates the left - right coarse - graining move , i.e. where the system size is increased by two lattice sites in the horizontal direction . in a similar way a top - bottom move is performed , which increases the system by two lattice sites in the vertical direction .",
    "these two moves are iterated until convergence is reached .",
    "including more tensors in each renormalization step helps to better determine the relevant subspace to be kept during truncation , since more information about the system is taken into account .",
    "the disadvantage is that this scheme is more strongly limited by the machine precision of the computer .",
    "this can be understood by considering the isotropic case : in the directional ctm of ref .",
    "the spectrum of a single corner matrix @xmath17 is computed , whereas in the present scheme , which involves multiplying all four corner matrices , yields the fourth power of the same spectrum , with singular values ( in this case , eigenvalues ) expanding many more orders of magnitudes , and therefore more vulnerable to errors due to finite machine precision .",
    "we observed that the ctmrg scheme converges better in the case of highly - entangled systems , as for example in the metal phase of the model close to the phase transition . in gapped systems",
    "both methods seem to converge equally well , with the directional ctm yielding slightly better accuracies than the present scheme .",
    "we used the former to address the gapped phase of the model , and the latter in all other simulations .",
