    "media streaming is going to be one of the major applications in wireless networks . for example , it is envisioned that a significant portion of the capacity demand in future wireless systems will come from media streaming applications . in this paper",
    ", we consider media streaming in mimo interference networks whereby multiple bss simultaneously deliver media to their associated users using fixed data rates .",
    "the performance of this system is fundamentally limited by the inter - cell interference from the cross - links . in traditional cellular networks ,",
    "the inter - cell interference is mitigated using frequency planing techniques such as frequency reuse or fractional frequency reuse @xcite . to further improve the spectrum efficiency ,",
    "more advanced techniques such as cooperative mimo ( comp ) @xcite and coordinated mimo @xcite have been proposed for future wireless systems .",
    "the comp technique can transform the cross - link interference into spatial multiplexing gain by sharing both real - time channel state information ( csi ) and payload data among the concerned bss .",
    "however , it requires high capacity backhaul for payload exchange between bss , which is a cost bottleneck especially in dense small cell networks . on the other hand ,",
    "the coordinated mimo is a more cost effective technique as it only requires the exchange of real - time csis among the bss to perform joint precoding .",
    "many mimo precoding optimization algorithms have been proposed for coordinated mimo .",
    "for example , in @xcite , a wmmse algorithm is proposed to find a stationary point of the weighted sum - rate maximization problem for multi - cell downlink systems . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proposed _ polite water - filling _ method for precoding optimization in b - mac interference networks based on the duality principle of interference networks .",
    "although the coordinated mimo requires smaller backhaul capacity , the overall performance is usually much lower than that of comp .",
    "recently , there have been some works conducted on multi - cell coordination with consideration of backhaul limitation . in @xcite , a distributed and hierarchical solution of joint beamforming and power allocation",
    "was proposed to maximize the worst - user sinr in time - division - duplex ( tdd ) multicell downlink systems where only limited inter - cell information exchange is permitted . in @xcite , random matrix theory",
    "is leveraged to design a distributed joint beamforming and power control algorithm that only requires statistical information .",
    "such design reduces the amount of control signaling over the backhaul .",
    "an interesting question is , can we achieve the comp gain with reduced backhaul bandwidth consumption ?",
    "we show that this is possible for media streaming applications by using a novel _ cache - induced opportunistic comp _ scheme proposed in this paper .",
    "specifically , we can opportunistically transform the interference network into a comp broadcast channel by caching a portion of the media files at the bss . as a result , there are two transmission modes at the physical layer , namely , the _ comp mode _ and the _ coordinated mimo mode _ , depending on the cache state at the bss .",
    "if the payload data accessed by each user exists in the cache of the bss , the bss can engage in comp and therefore , enjoy a large performance gain without consuming the backhaul bandwidth .",
    "otherwise , coordinated mimo is employed at the bss to serve the users .",
    "hence , there is a cache - induced topology change in the physical layer ( dynamic comp opportunity ) of the mimo interference network . as such",
    ", a mimo interference network employing the cache - induced opportunistic comp is called a _ cached mimo interference network _ in this paper . with high capacity caches at the bss and a proper caching strategy , the opportunity of comp in the cached mimo interference network can be very large and thus the proposed solution will have a significant gain over the coordinated mimo scheme with even smaller backhaul consumption .",
    "note that in the proposed solution , the reduced backhaul consumption is due to the reduced payload data transmission over the backhaul .",
    "the payload data transmission consumes much more backhaul bandwidth than the exchange of control signaling because the former needs to be done on a per - symbol basis but the latter needs to be done on a per frame basis .",
    "hence the backhaul saving of the proposed solution is much more significant compared to those only reduce the control signaling in the backhaul @xcite . since the cost of hard disks is much lower than the cost of optical fiber backhaul , the proposed solution is very cost effective .",
    "the performance of the proposed solution depends heavily on the dynamic caching strategy ( which affects the opportunity of comp ) and the mimo precoding design .",
    "we study a mixed - timescale joint optimization of mimo precoding and cache control in cached mimo interference networks to minimize the average sum transmit power subject to fixed data rate constraints for all users .",
    "the role of cache control is to create more comp opportunities and is adaptive to long - term popularity of the media files ( long - term control ) .",
    "the role of mimo precoding optimization is to exploit the comp opportunities ( induced by the cache ) to guarantee the individual rate constraints for each user . as such",
    ", it is adaptive to the instantaneous csi and the _ cache state _ at the bss .",
    "there are several first order technical challenges to be addressed .    *",
    "* limited cache size * : the performance gain of the proposed scheme depends heavily on the comp opportunity , which in turn depends on the cache size and cache strategy .",
    "the bss usually do not have enough cache to store all the media files . as will be shown in example [ naive - cahce - scheme ] ,",
    "when brute force caching is used , even if a significant portion of the media files are cached at bss , the comp opportunity can still be very small and this is highly undesirable .",
    "* * non - convex stochastic optimization * : the mixed - timescale joint optimization of mimo precoding and cache control is a non - convex stochastic optimization problem and the complexity of finding the optimal solution is extremely high .",
    "for example , the short - term mimo precoding optimization in the interference networks is well known to be a difficult non - convex problem .",
    "furthermore , the objective function for long - term cache control has no closed form expression because the short - term precoding problem has no closed form solution and the popularity of the media files is in general unknown . * * complex coupling between cache control and precoding * * optimization * : caching has been widely used in fixed line p2p systems @xcite and content distribution networks ( cdns ) @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a femtocaching scheme has also been proposed for wireless systems . however",
    ", these schemes do not consider cache - induced opportunistic comp among the bss .",
    "hence , the cache control in the above works is independent of the physical layer and is fundamentally different from our case where the cache control and physical layer are coupled together . in our case , the cache control will affect the physical layer dynamics seen by * * precoding * * optimization due to different comp opportunities .",
    "on the other hand , the short - term precoding strategy adopted in the physical layer will also affect the cache control due to a different cost - reward dynamic .    to address the above challenges ,",
    "we first propose a novel cache data structure called _ mds - coded random cache _ which can significantly improve the probability of comp .",
    "we then exploit the timescale separations of the optimization variables to decompose the stochastic optimization problem into a _ short - term precoding problem _ and a _ long - term stochastic cache control problem_. we generalize the wmmse approach in @xcite to find a stationary point for the short - term precoding problem . to solve the long - term cache control problem ,",
    "we first show that despite the non - convexity in the short - term precoding problem , there is a hidden convexity in the long - term stochastic cache control problem .",
    "we propose a stochastic - subgradient - like iterative solution and show that it converges to the optimal solution of this long - term stochastic optimization problem .",
    "the proposed solution has low complexity and does not require explicit knowledge of the popularity of the media files .",
    "finally , we illustrate with simulations that the proposed solution achieves significant gain over various baselines under the consideration of overhead in the backhaul .",
