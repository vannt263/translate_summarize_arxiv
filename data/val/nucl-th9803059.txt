    "the goal of relativistic heavy ion collisions is to study the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions , including extremely high density and/or temperature .",
    "this information is important for understanding the physics of the early universe and for studying the dynamic and static properties of stellar objects , like the structure of neutron stars and supernova explosion .",
    "it has been suggested that there may exist various phase transitions in the nuclear matter , such as the liquid - gas phase transition @xcite , the kaon condensation @xcite , the restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite , and the formation of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "these phase transitions , if they do occur in heavy ion collisions , will have significant phenomenological implications .",
    "for example , as a precursor to chiral symmetry restoration , hadron properties are expected to be modified in hot and dense matter @xcite , leading to significant effects on their production rate . to study the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter ,",
    "heavy - ion accelerators have been constructed since mid-70s . at the relativistic energy regime ,",
    "important facilities include the bevalac at berkeley , the sis at darmstadt , the ags at brookhaven and the sps at cern . still under construction are two ultra - relativistic colliders ; the rhic at bnl and the heavy ion program at cern lhc .    to extract information about phase transitions and hadron in - medium properties from heavy ion experiments , different observables that are sensitive to the underlying theoretical parameters have been proposed . among the important ones are the collective flow of various types @xcite and particle production @xcite .",
    "dileptons , because of their relatively weak interaction with the dense environment , are particularly useful for studying the medium effects and phase transitions in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "dielectron production in the energy regime of 1 - 2 gev / nucleon was studied by the dls collaboration at the bevalac in berkeley @xcite . because of the high hadron multiplicity",
    "the heaviest systems measured with dls were reactions involving ca+ca . also , the mass resolution of the dls spectrometer is not sufficient to resolve the @xmath1 and @xmath2 peaks from the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "a second generation detector hades is currently under construction at gsi @xcite . with its high counting rate capability and large geometrical acceptance ,",
    "hades is able to measure dielectron pairs for the heavy system u+u . with an invariant mass resolution",
    "better than 1% , a clear identification of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 peaks can be achieved .    at higher sps energies ,",
    "dilepton spectra have been measured by three collaborations : the ceres collaboration is specialized in the mass region up to about 1.5 gev @xcite , the helios-3 collaboration has measured dimuon spectra from its threshold up to the @xmath4 region @xcite , and the na38/na50 collaboration measures dimuon spectra in the intermediate- and high - mass region @xcite .",
    "recent observation of low - mass dilepton enhancement in heavy - ion collisions by the ceres and helios-3 collaborations has led to the suggestions of various medium effects @xcite , including the dropping of vector meson masses in hot dense matter .",
    "theoretical studies on dilepton production at bevalac energies were carried out by xiong _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and wolf _ et .",
    "they calculated the dilepton yield from proton - neutron ( @xmath5 ) bremsstrahlung , @xmath6 dalitz decay , @xmath7 annihilation , pion annihilation on nucleon , and , in ref .",
    "@xcite , also the @xmath8 dalitz decay .",
    "their results indicate that the @xmath9 dalitz decay dominates the invariant mass spectrum below the pion mass .",
    "the @xmath8 dalitz decay then dominates the spectrum up to an invariant mass of 450 mev . above 500 mev ,",
    "the most important channels are found to be @xmath5 bremsstrahlung and @xmath10 annihilation .",
    "these studies reproduce well the original dls data @xcite .",
    "recently published data from the dls collaboration @xcite show , however , a strong enhancement in the @xmath8 mass region compared with the original data , implying that the @xmath8 yield could be enhanced .",
    "this is , however , in conflict with the @xmath8 yield and spectra measured by the taps collaboration for similar reactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will concern ourselves mainly with dilepton spectra from phi meson decay in heavy - ion collisions at energies available from the sis at gsi , where experimental data will become available in the near future from the hades collaboration .",
    "the study of phi meson in heavy ion collisions is interesting in view of the following considerations :    * first of all , phi meson is a pure @xmath11 state , and its production in hadronic interactions are therefore suppressed by the ozi rule @xcite .",
    "this has led to the suggestion of identifying phi meson enhancement as a possible signature for the formation of the quark - gluon plasma in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . *",
    "phi meson decays chiefly into a kaon - antikaon pair .",
    "since the mass of phi meson is very close to twice the kaon mass ( @xmath12 = 0.032 gev ) , its width in free space is small ( about 4.4 mev ) . in nuclear medium ,",
    "both kaon and phi meson masses may change .",
    "if the decrease of @xmath13 is larger than that of @xmath14 , then the phi meson decay width would increase , leading to a broader phi meson mass spectrum . on the other hand , if the decrease of phi meson mass is larger than that of @xmath15 , its strong decay channel will be prohibited in the medium .",
    "the phi meson mass spectrum from heavy - ion collisions thus provides important information on the medium modification of both kaon and phi mesons .",
    "the suggestion of studying the kaon medium effects from phi meson production in heavy - ion collisions was first proposed by shuryak and collaborators @xcite . * in qcd sum - rule calculations",
    "@xcite , the change of phi meson mass is related to the nucleon strangeness content .",
    "thus , the detection of in - medium phi meson mass is expected to provide indirect information about the nucleon strangeness content . *",
    "experimentally , phi meson can be detected from both its @xmath16 and dilepton decay channels .",
    "the main difference between these two channels is that in the @xmath16 case , the strong kaon and antikaon final - state interactions basically limit the detection of only those phi mesons that decay at and after freeze - out , while from the dilepton channel one can also detect phi mesons that decay inside the initial hot dense matter , i.e. , before freeze - out . therefore , a simultaneous measurement of the phi meson spectra in the @xmath16 and dilepton channels will provide useful information about the relative decay probabilities of phi mesons inside and outside the matter .",
    "phi meson production from heavy - ion collisions has already been studied at various energies . at sps energies",
    "it was measured by the na38 collaboration @xcite and the helios-3 collaboration @xcite via the dimuon invariant mass spectra . a factor of 2 to 3 enhancement in the double ratio @xmath17 was observed .",
    "various theoretical attempts have been made to understand this enhancement @xcite .",
    "in particular , an enhancement of the phi meson yield may be a signature of the formation of a quark - gluon plasma in the collisions @xcite .",
    "however , the enhancement can also be explained in hadronic models if one takes into account the reduced phi meson mass in medium @xcite or the formation of color ropes in the initial stage of the collisions @xcite .",
    "the phi meson yield has also been measured at ags / bnl by the e802 collaboration in central collisions between a 14.6 agev / c si beam and a au target @xcite .",
    "they are identified from the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath18 pairs , and the measured phi meson mass and width are found to be consistent with those in free space .",
    "the ratio of the phi meson yield to the @xmath19 yield is about 10% , which can be understood if thermal and chemical equilibrium with a temperature of about 110 mev are assumed at freeze out @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations based on the coalescence model @xcite , in which the phi meson is formed from the kaon and antikaon at freeze out , underestimate the data by a large factor , indicating that processes other than kaon - antikaon annihilation should dominate phi meson production at these energies .",
    "phi meson production from heavy - ion collisions at sis / gsi energies is being studied by the fopi collaboration @xcite through the @xmath18 invariant mass distribution .",
    "a total of @xmath20 @xmath2 has been reconstructed in the reaction ni+ni at 1.93 gev / nucleon from an event sample of @xmath21 events .",
    "based on these preliminary results it has been concluded that the phi meson yield is about 10% of the @xmath19 yield , which is very similar to that observed at the ags energies . this is somewhat surprising since the sis energies are below the phi meson production threshold in the nucleon - nucleon collision in free space , while the ags energies are well above the threshold . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied phi meson production from heavy - ion collisions at these energies through its @xmath22 decay channel .",
    "comparison of the phi meson yield from the transport model with the preliminary data from the fopi collaboration @xcite seems to indicate that medium effects on phi meson play a non - negligible role .",
    "the present work is a continuation of ref .",
    "our main motivation is to examine the feasibility of detecting directly the reduction of phi meson mass in nuclear medium from the dilepton invariant mass spectrum from heavy ion collisions , which will be measured by hades in the near future @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the dilepton decay of phi mesons in heavy ion collisions at sis energies have been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite by assuming that they are only produced from @xmath23 annihilation .",
    "it was found that for dileptons with invariant mass around @xmath24 , contributions from @xmath10 annihilation and phi meson decay are comparable . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath2 mesons can also be produced from baryon - baryon collisions and pion - baryon collisions .",
    "because of the larger abundance of pions and nucleons than kaons , these two channels were found to be more important than the @xmath25 channel .",
    "one thus expect that including these contributions in the transport model would raise the @xmath2 peak in the dilepton mass spectrum to above the background from @xmath26 @xmath26 annihilation and also other background studied in refs .",
    "in addition , we will also consider the background from direct leptonic decay of rho and omega mesons produced from baryon - baryon and pion - baryon interactions .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the theoretical predictions for the properties of vector mesons and kaon meson in dense matter . in section 3",
    "we discuss the elementary cross sections for vector meson and kaon production in baryon - baryon and meson - baryon interactions .",
    "the results and discussions of dilepton production from heavy ion collisions are then presented in section 4 .",
    "the papers ends with a brief conclusion in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we review briefly various theoretical predictions for the in - medium properties of vector mesons and kaons .",
    "details can be found in a recent review by two of the authors @xcite .      various approaches and models",
    "have been used to study theoretically the vector meson masses in nuclear matter .",
    "these include the scaling anatz of brown and rho @xcite , the qcd sum - rule approach @xcite , the quark - meson coupling model @xcite , and the quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite .",
    "all these studies seem to suggest that decreasing vector meson masses is a generic consequence of chiral symmetry restoration at high densities and/or temperature .",
    "studies on vector meson in - medium masses using the qcd sum rules were first carried out by hatsuda and lee @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the real part of the current - current correlation function is expressed in terms of the scalar quark and gluon condensates after using the operator product expansion(ope ) at short distances .",
    "the imaginary part is , on the other hand , parameterized phenomenologically . using the dispersion relation to relate the real and imaginary parts ,",
    "vector meson masses are found to satisfy certain sum rules involving the quark and gluon condensates . to extend this approach to vector mesons in nuclear medium",
    ", one needs to include not only the density dependence of the condensates but also non - scalar condensates . with a simple delta - function plus continuum for the rho meson spectral function , hatsuda and lee obtained the following results for the in - medium vector meson masses @xcite @xmath27 the uncertainties in the above expressions are due to uncertainties in the density dependence of the condensates . at normal nuclear matter density , @xmath28 , rho and",
    "omega meson masses thus drop by about 20% . for phi meson ,",
    "the in - medium mass depends on the nucleon strangeness content @xmath29 .",
    "taking @xmath30 , the phi meson mass is seen to drop by about 2% at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the qcd sum rules for vector mesons were reanalyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite by assessing the uncertainties of the condensates and other inputs using the monte carlo error analysis .",
    "it was found that at normal nuclear matter density @xmath31 , in agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the assumption that the rho meson spectral function in nuclear medium is the sum of a delta function and a continuum is , however , too simplistic , as the rho meson has a large decay width in free space and it also interacts strongly with nucleons .",
    "an improved qcd sum - rule calculation was carried out by asakawa and ko @xcite using a more realistic rho meson spectral function .",
    "they found a similar decrease of the rho meson mass with density as that of ref . @xcite .",
    "more recently , another realistic study of rho meson spectral function has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is found the rho meson mass does not change but its width becomes larger .",
    "this rho spectral function also satisfies the qcd sum rules . according to liupold _",
    "@xcite , the qcd sum rules do not give a stringent constraint on the rho meson spectral function as they can be satisfied either with a reduced mass and width or a larger width but without much change in its mass .",
    "the quark - meson coupling model has also been used to study the density dependence of hadron masses @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the vector meson is treated as an mit bag with two light quarks which are coupled to the vector and scalar fields generated by the nuclear medium .",
    "it was found that at normal nuclear matter density the rho and omega meson masses drop by about 17% , in agreement with the qcd sum - rule predictions .",
    "various hadronic models have also been used to study the medium effect on vector meson masses .",
    "calculations that only include the polarization of the fermi sea predict that @xmath1 and @xmath3 meson masses either increase or stay more or less the same in nuclear matter @xcite . the effect of vacuum polarization or the polarization due to nucleons in the dirac sea was studied in refs . @xcite and found to dominate over the fermi sea polarization , leading thus to decreasing rho and omega meson masses . for phi meson ,",
    "both nucleon and hyperon vacuum polarization contribute , leading to a reduction of its mass by about 2 - 3% at normal nuclear matter density as in qcd sum - rule studies @xcite . in the vector dominance model ,",
    "inclusion of dropping kaon - antikoan in - medium mass also leads to a decrease of phi meson mass in nuclear medium @xcite .    the results from refs .",
    "@xcite for vector meson in - medium masses are summarized in fig .",
    "[ vmass ] . in this work , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we use the results of hatsuda and lee @xcite for the density dependence of vector meson masses and linearly extrapolate it to high densities .",
    "because of the change in vector meson masses , their decay widths are also modified .",
    "the rho meson decays dominantly to two pions with the following decay width in nuclear matter , @xmath32 where the coupling @xmath33 is determined from its decay width in free space .",
    "the omega meson decays mostly to three pions . without a hadronic model the functional form of the decay width",
    "can not be given .",
    "here we simply assume that its decay width is proportional to its in - medium mass , i.e. , @xmath34 the density dependence of the rho and omega meson decay widths is shown in fig .",
    "[ vwidth ] .      since phi mesons decay predominantly into @xmath35 pairs",
    ", it is necessary to address the issue of kaon medium effects .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the phi meson yield can also be used as a signature for the medium effect on kaons .",
    "a reduced kaon in - medium mass increases @xmath36 , so phi mesons are more likely to decay before freeze out , leading to a lower yield of final phi mesons that can be detected through their decay into @xmath16 pairs .",
    "a cleaner signature can be observed from the width of the phi meson peak in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum .",
    "a significantly broadened peak can be another signature of the kaon medium effect .",
    "since the pioneering work of kaplan and nelson @xcite on the possibility of kaon condensation in nuclear matter , a large amount of theoretical efforts have been devoted to the study of kaon properties in dense matter , using such diversified approaches as the chiral lagrangian @xcite , the nambu@xmath37jona - lasinio model @xcite , and the su(3 ) walecka - type mean - field model @xcite .",
    "although quantitative results from these models are not identical , a consistent picture has emerged qualitatively ; namely , in nuclear matter the @xmath38 feels a weak repulsive potential , whereas the @xmath39 feels a strong attractive potential .",
    "most experimental data for strangeness production and collective flow in heavy ion collisions at sis energies @xcite have been found to support the existence of these medium effects @xcite . the kaon and antikaon potentials also have observable effects on kaon azimuthal distributions @xcite and antikaon flow @xcite .",
    "we will consider two scenarios for kaon properties in nuclear medium , one with and one without medium modification . from the chiral lagrangian the kaon and antikaon in - medium masses can be written as @xcite @xmath40^{1/2 } + b_k \\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41^{1/2 } - b_k \\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 gev@xmath43@xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are two parameters that determine the strength of the attractive scalar potential for kaon and antikaon , respectively .",
    "if one considers only the kaplan - nelson term , then @xmath47 . in the same order , there is also a range term which acts differently on kaon and antikaon , and leads to different scalar attractions .",
    "since the exact value of @xmath48 and the size of the higher - order corrections are still under debate , we take the point of view that @xmath49 can be treated as free parameters and try to constrain them from the experimental observables in heavy - ion collisions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that @xmath50 gev@xmath51@xmath43@xmath44 and @xmath52 gev@xmath51@xmath44 provide a good description of the kaon and antikaon spectra from ni+ni collisions at 1 and 1.8 agev .",

    "the dropping of @xmath54 is apparently more significant than that of @xmath14 .",
    "one of the most important inputs in the transport model for particle production from heavy - ion collisions is the elementary particle production cross section in hadron - hadron interactions . in this section",
    "we shall discuss the vector meson and kaon production cross sections that are used in the present work .",
    "we will also discuss dilepton production cross sections from @xmath5 bremsstrahlung and pion - pion annihilation , as well as the decay widths of vector mesons into dileptons .      in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies ,",
    "the most abundant particles are nucleons , @xmath6 resonances , and pions .",
    "phi meson can thus be produced from reactions such as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , phi meson can also be formed from kaon - antikaon annihilation , which has a cross section of usual breit - wigner form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the invariant mass of the kaon - antikaon pair and @xmath62 is the magnitude of the kaon momentum in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the cross sections for the other processes listed above have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite based on an one - boson exchange model . for the reaction @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes either a nucleon or a @xmath6 resonance , rho meson exchange is used , while both rho and pion exchange are introduced for the reaction @xmath65 .",

    "most cut - off parameters at the interaction vertices aer also taken from the bonn model . since the exchanged rho and pion are virtual , two cut - off parameters at the @xmath68 vertex are introduced , and they are determined by fitting to available experimental data for the reactions @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this model is then extended , without introducing further adjustable parameters , to calculate the cross sections involving baryon resonances .",
    "an important background for the dilepton spectrum around phi meson mass comes from the tail part of the dilepton spectra from the decay of omega and rho mesons , which are produced from baryon - baryon and pion - baryon interactions .",

    "the histogram bin size is taken to be 10 mev , corresponding roughly to the mass resolution of hades in the phi meson mass region .",
    "the major background around phi meson peak comes from @xmath10 annihilation .",
    "the contribution from direct rho meson decay is about a factor of 3 below that from @xmath118 annihilation .",
    "furthermore , the contribution from @xmath5 bremsstrahlung is about one order of magnitude smaller than other background in this mass region . finally , the contribution from direct omega meson decay is insignificant due to its narrow mass distribution .",
    "a well defined phi meson peak is seen in the dilepton spectrum , reflecting its small decay width of about 4 mev .",
    "overall the phi meson peak is about a factor 4 - 5 above the background .",
    "this make its detection relatively easy if the mass resolution is about 1% .    in the second scenario ,",
    "we turn on the kaon medium effects as were required to explain the measured kaon yields and flow @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fiwidth ] , because of the opening - up of the phase space , the phi meson decay width increases substantially in nuclear medium . as a result ,",
    "phi mesons tend to decay faster and therefore less number of phi mesons can be detected via the @xmath16 channel . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that the inclusion of kaon medium effects reduces the phi meson yield determined from the @xmath16 analysis by about a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , the increase of phi meson decay width broadens its mass distribution and results in a large apparent width in the dilepton spectrum .",
    "the results in this scenario are shown in fig .",
    "as medium effects on vector mesons are neglected , the background is the same as in fig .",
    "[ ee ] . because of the increase of phi meson decay width",
    ", the dilepton mass spectrum from phi mesons becomes much broader than in fig .",
    "[ ee ] , with a width of about 30 - 40 mev .",
    "consequently , the height of the peak is substantially reduced , and the phi meson peak is now below the background from @xmath118 annihilation , leading to a broad bump instead of a sharp peak around @xmath24 in the total dilepton spectrum .",
    "the results in the case with both kaon and vector meson medium effects are shown in fig .",
    "the most important background around the phi meson is still from @xmath118 annihilation , which is , however , significantly smaller than in the case without vector meson medium effects .",
    "this is mainly due to the dropping rho meson mass that shifts the strength to masses below @xmath119 .",
    "although the rho meson yield is enhanced due to its dropping mass , they contribute mainly to dileptons with masses below @xmath119 . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution from direct omega meson decay is enhanced in the dropping mass scenario , and it becomes comparable to that from direct rho meson decay .",
    "this is due to the enhanced production of omega meson , and the fact that most omega mesons decay after the freeze - out , when their masses return to the free ones . in this case",
    "the @xmath2 peak is about a factor of 3 - 4 above the background .",
    "furthermore , there appears a shoulder around the invariant mass of 0.95 gev , arising from the decay of phi mesons inside the fireball .",
    "unfortunately , the height of the shoulder is about a factor of 2 below the background . in the total dilepton spectrum , an outstanding and broad peak instead of a weak bump",
    "is seen .    in fig .",
    "[ phiee ] we summarize the dilepton spectra from phi meson decay in the three scenarios discussed above . in the scenario without medium effects , a very sharp phi peak is seen with a width of about 4 mev .",
    "including kaon medium effects that increases the phi meson decay width , the dilepton spectrum from phi meson decay becomes much broader with a width of about 30 - 40 mev , and its height is substantially reduced . in the scenario with both decreasing kaon and vector meson in - medium masses , the dilepton spectrum is also quite broad with a width of about 30 - 40 mev .",
    "its height increases , however , by about a factor of 2 with respect to the second scenario , reflecting the fact that the phi meson yield is increased due to a reduced mass . a shoulder , although not very prominant , also develops around 0.95 gev as a result of the decay of phi mesons inside the fireball .",
    "our studies thus show that it will be quite difficult to isolate or extract from the measured dilepton spectrum the contribution from phi mesons .",
    "it is therefore useful to identify the characteristic differences in the total dilepton spectra from the three scenarios .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ totee ] .",
    "the dotted curves in the figure show the background in the three scenarios , with those of the first and second scenario being the same . with the hades mass resolution of about 1%",
    ", we expect to see a sharp peak in the dilepton spectrum which is about a factor of 5 above the background , if there are no medium effects on both kaon and vector mesons .",
    "on the other hand , a weak bump around @xmath24 would indicate that the phi meson mass distribution becomes broader as a result of kaon medium effects .",
    "finally , if a broad and significant peak is seen around @xmath24 together with a shoulder around 0.95 gev , this could be a good indication for the existence of both kaon and vector meson medium effects .",
    "in conclusion , continuing our previous investigation on phi meson production from heavy - ion collisions @xcite , we studied in this paper the possibility of seeing the phi meson through its dilepton spectrum . to make a quantitative prediction ,",
    "we have included contributions to dileptons with invariant mass around @xmath24 from pion - pion annihilation , @xmath5 bremsstrahlung , and the direct decay of rho and omega mesons .",
    "the most important one is found to come from pion - pion annihilation .",
    "we have considered three scenarios for the kaon and vector meson properties in nuclear medium .",
    "the dilepton spectra from phi meson decays , as well as the total dilepton spectra , in the three scenarios show quite different characteristics .",
    "we conclude that with a mass resolution of about 1% as to be achieved by the hades collaboration , it is possible to determine qualitatively whether there are any medium effect on kaon and/or vector mesons . a quantitative determination of the effective masses of kaons and vector mesons from the dilepton spectrum is found to be difficult",
    ". however , a combination of the information from the dilepton spectra and other observables such as the phi meson yield from the analysis of @xmath16 channels as well as the kaon yields and spectra will definitely provide good constraints on the in - medium properties of kaons and vector mesons .",
