    "frustrated spin  systems have attracted a lot of interest in the last years , because they may possess exotic ground states that are very different from conventional nel  ordered states .",
    "such states are especially intriguing , as connections to high-@xmath2 superconductivity have been put forward  @xcite .",
    "they are usually characterized by a break down of long  range order : the system reorganizes in a quantum state where only local antiferromagnetic correlations are present .",
    "the class of such states , named short range valence bond states ( srvb ) , encompasses a broad range of phases : they range from valence bond crystals ( vbc ) with broken translational symmetry to pure spin liquids that have all symmetries restored .",
    "studies of frustrated systems are especially challenging , because quantum monte ",
    "carlo ( qmc ) studies are hindered by the sign - problem  @xcite and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite investigations are hard to perform for systems with dimensionality larger than one .",
    "other methods that have been developed to take on these systems are , for example , the coupled cluster method  @xcite , dmrg combined with qmc  @xcite and exact diagonalizations within the subspace of srvb  @xcite . in this paper , we would like to give the recently developed peps  algorithm  @xcite a try .",
    "this algorithm has already been successfully applied to the heisenberg antiferromagnet  @xcite , the bose  hubbard model  @xcite and the frustrated shastry  sutherland model  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath3 model .",

    "the peps algorithm is a variational algorithm within the class of _ projected engangled pair states _ ( peps )  @xcite . these states are expedient for a numerical study of many  particle systems : on the one hand , they fulfill the area ",
    "law that is fundamental to non  critical systems . on the other hand ,",
    "they possess a number of parameters that scales polynomially with the system size .",
    "this feature makes numerical simulations feasible .",
    "the structure of peps is inspired from the structure of _ matrix product states _ ( mps )  @xcite that form the basis for the successful dmrg algorithm  @xcite : to each lattice site , a tensor is associated that possesses a physical index and a certain number of virtual indices .",
    "the virtual indices are contracted according to a scheme that mimics the underlying lattice  structure .",
    "the dimension of the physical index equals the physical dimension of the particle residing on that lattice site .",
    "the dimension of the virtual indices , @xmath6 , is the internal refinement parameter of peps : @xmath7 specializes the peps to a product state ; the choice @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 being the total number of lattice sites and @xmath10 the physical dimension of one particle ) enlarges the space of peps to the complete hilbert ",
    "space of the system .",
    "the main idea of the algorithm is to optimize the tensors such that the energy tends to a minimum .",
    "this can be done by sequentially optimizing the tensors or by cooling the system with the simulation of an imaginary time evolution . here",
    ", we follow the latter . time and memory required for this method turn out to be polynomial both in @xmath9 and @xmath6 : time scales as @xmath11 and memory as @xmath12 .",
    "this polynomal scaling allows us to investigate systems of sizes that are out of reach with other algorithms .",
    "we discuss our observations in the following sections .",
    "in the @xmath3 model on a square lattice , frustration is caused by the competition between first , second and third neighbor interactions of magnitudes  @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively :    @xmath16    the phase diagram of this model is involved and still controversal . of special interest are the regimes of maximal frustration that are suspected of having non - classical ground states .",

    "the system possesses four phases , as shown in figure  [ fig : j1j2j3 ] : the usual nel phase , two spiral antiferromagnetic phases ordered at @xmath4 and @xmath5 and a phase consisting of two independent sublattices .",
    "the nel phase is bounded by the _ classical critical line _ @xmath18 .    when quantum fluctuations are taken into account ,",
    "the phase diagram changes considerably  @xcite : the nel phase substantially extends to larger values of @xmath15 , up to the line of maximal frustration @xmath19 . in the vicinity of this line",
    ", it is believed that the classical ordered ground state is destabilized and a singlet ground state is formed  @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of this state is still controversal : suggestions include columnar valence bond crystals  @xcite , plaquette states  @xcite and spin liquids  @xcite .",
    "special attention has been devoted to the end - points of the line : the point at @xmath20 that separates the nel from the spiral antiferromagnetic phase  @xcite , and the tri - critial point at @xmath21 at which @xmath22 phases meet  @xcite .     and @xmath23 .",
