    "in the past decade the magnetism of fine particles embedded in a non magnetic matrix has been a topic of interest because of their uses on chemical catalysis and magnetic recording @xcite .",
    "the appearance of new experimental techniques capable of generating samples with controlled nanostructures@xcite has led to important advances in the preparation and understanding of the behavior of granular materials . however , at the nanometer scale , magnetic systems are not easily reproduced and characterized , introducing difficulties for the investigation of these systems .",
    "experimental and theoretical results over the past years show that there are clearly many factors that influence the magnetic and magnetotransport behavior of these systems , such as the distribution of grain sizes , the average size and shape of the grains and the magnetic anisotropy of the individual grains . also",
    "the role of magnetic interactions among crystallites is a topic full of controversies , despite the intense research on the subject .",
    "one of the most used methods to investigate the role of interactions has been monte carlo simulations .",
    "el - hilo _",
    "et al._@xcite had used it for determining the magnetoresistance dependence on the mean intergranular distance , or rather , the particle concentration , using a simple expression previously obtained by gittleman _",
    "et al._@xcite also garcia - otero _",
    "et al._@xcite analyzed the interplay between anisotropy and magnetic interactions and chantrell _ et al._@xcite calculated the susceptibility and zfc - fc ( zero field cooled - field cooled ) magnetization curves for superparamagnetic particles .",
    "some simple models taking the dipolar interaction into account have been proposed .",
    "for example , mrup and tronc @xcite have formulated a description for weakly interacting particles , and dormann _",
    "et al._@xcite have proposed the dormann - bessais - fiorani ( dbf ) model , valid for weak and medium strength of the interactions .",
    "both models lead to contradictory results , as analyzed in ref .",
    "the discrepancy arises when we try to determine if increasing concentration , the interactions leads to increase or decrease the energy barrier of the system .",
    "more recently , allia _",
    "et al._@xcite have proposed analytical models that take explicitly into account the correlation arising from the dipolar interactions on nearly superparamagnetic systems and pike _",
    "et al._@xcite investigated the role of magnetic interactions on low temperature saturation remanence of fine magnetic particles . from the experimental point of view , while dilute systems are well understood , results for denser ones , where the interactions between particles play an important role , are still not clear .",
    "the main reasons are the unavoidable particle size distribution and difficulties in controlling and replicating geometrical arrangement and orientation of easy axis for higher concentrations .",
    "in particular we can mention that for fe particles embedded in an alumina matrix@xcite and for @xmath0@xcite particles , an increase of the blocking temperature @xmath1 with interaction strength is obtained .",
    "however , also for @xmath0 particles investigated by mossbauer spectroscopy @xmath1 decreases with increasing concentration , as presented in [ 14 ] .",
    "apart from the influence of concentration , or interparticle distance , in systems for which the dipolar interaction may not be neglected , it is important to consider the effect of dimensionality , specially when one deals with systems formed from sequential deposition of layers .",
    "@xcite luis _ et al._@xcite investigated the role of dipolar interactions on the magnetization of co clusters grown in a quasi - ordered layered structure , and showed that the affective activation energy increases linearly with the number of nearest neighbor clusters .",
    "these results have been interpreted in terms of a transition from 2d to 3d collective in ref . [ 15 ] .",
    "et al._@xcite investigated the effect of interactions on a 2d lattice of grains and found a peak on the remanence as a function of temperature , which can be interpreted as an evidence of the existence of two low magnetization states : one due to an in - plane alignment perpendicular to the field direction at low temperatures , and a high temperature disordered state . in this paper",
    "we have extended these results to 3d systems , considering the effect of increasing the number of stacked layers , and lattice geometry .",
    "the hysteresis curves are simulated by means of monte carlo method .",
    "a ferromagnetic particle becomes a monodomain when its linear size is below a critical value @xmath2 determined by the minimization of the total energy , including magnetostatic , exchange and anisotropy contributions.@xcite such monodomain ferromagnetic particles can be viewed as large magnetic units , each one having a magnetic moment of thousands of bohr magnetons . for neighboring particles separated by @xmath3 nm ,",
    "direct and indirect exchange ( like rkky ) can be neglected @xcite , thus , the magnetic properties of such assembly of nanoparticles are determined by the dipolar interaction energy among the particles along with thermal and magnetic anisotropy energies .",
    "the magnetic irreversibility of an isolated nanomagnet is conventionally associated to the energy required for the particle moment reorientation , overcoming a barrier due to shape , magnetoelasticity , and/or crystalline anisotropy.@xcite in the presence of relevant dipolar interactions , this simplified picture no longer holds , as each particle is subject to a complicated energy landscape .    to investigate the magnetic behavior of interacting grains we have examined two simple systems consisting of @xmath4 layers of @xmath5 magnetic 3d monodomain particles .",
    "each layer is parallel to the @xmath6 plane and has free boundary conditions .",
    "two nearest neighbors arrangements were considered , with square and triangular symmetries , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - redes ] .",
    "the distance between particles on each layer is defined by the lattice parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for square lattices , and @xmath9 for triangular lattices , the layers separation is given by @xmath10 . from now on the terms in - plane and out - plane refer to the @xmath6 plane .",
    "planes with rectangular arrangement . in this case",
    "the grains are separated by @xmath7 and @xmath8 along the @xmath11 and @xmath12 axis respectively , separated by @xmath10 on the @xmath13 direction.(b ) @xmath6 planes with a triangular symmetry and nearest neighbor distance @xmath9 are separated by a distance @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig - redes ] ]    the particles have uniform magnetization , @xmath14 , and anisotropy constant , @xmath15 erg/@xmath16 , corresponding to slightly elongated cobalt grains with about 511 atoms and linear dimensions of the order of 20 .@xcite each particle is described by the position of its center of mass and the direction of the randomly chosen 3d easy magnetization axis , @xmath17 , and are coupled by means of dipolar interactions . since we seek to understand the role of lattice geometry , we prefer to control the distance between grains through the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , instead of concentration .",
    "the values of lattices parameters are such that the particles surfaces are more than one cobalt lattice parameter apart .",
    "@xcite the external field is always in the @xmath11 direction .    in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath18 , the total energy of the system is written as @xmath19 \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the volume of each grain .",
    "@xmath22 is the classical dipolar energy between grains @xmath23 and @xmath24 given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the distance between the centers of particles @xmath27 and @xmath24 , and @xmath28 is the unit vector along the direction that connects them . using this expression for the energy we have simulated hysteresis curves for different values of temperature and lattice symmetries .",
    "hysteresis curves correspond to sequences of nonequilibrium states of the system , and therefore depend on the field variation rate . in terms of a monte carlo simulation",
    "this means that we have to avoid equilibrium by a sufficiently fast variation of the field , and the usual mechanism of time averaging instead of ensemble averaging is not valid .",
    "monte carlo simulations were carried out using metropolis algorithm with local dynamics in which the new orientation of the magnetic moment was chosen within a solid angle around the previous moment direction , with aperture @xmath29 .",
    "this method was studied by pereira nunes _",
    "et al._@xcite , applied to the simulation of zfc - fc magnetization curves , which are also a collection of nonequilibrium states , and it is a reasonable approach for a qualitative analysis .",
    "monte carlo simulations of hysteresis curves have been used in a variety of magnetic systems with good qualitative agreement with experimental data , so we believe that , although not specifically created to describe nonequilibrium processes , the method provides a valuable tool for studying the dynamics of complex systems.@xcite for simulating hysteresis , we started at a fixed temperature from a configuration in which the magnetic moment directions were randomly chosen .",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath30 koe in the @xmath11 direction was turned on , one of the grains was randomly chosen , and had its magnetic moment rotated by an angle restricted to a cone , as explained above . the change in energy ( @xmath31 ) was calculated and the rotation accepted with probability @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "this procedure was repeated @xmath33 times , comprising one monte carlo step .",
    "the number of monte carlo steps in nonequilibrium simulations is a rather arbitrary choice , as explained by pereira nunes _ et al . _",
    "@xcite actually , the variation rate of the external field is the important quantity . in this case",
    ", we first fixed the value of the variation step for the external field , @xmath34 , with the objective of having enough points in the region of interest , near @xmath35 , but still being able to bring the system to saturation .",
    "we found that 200 monte carlo steps was a good choice for @xmath36koe , since the system shows hysteresis for some values of temperature , and the area of the hysteresis cycle shows sensitivity to temperature variation .",
    "the virgin curve was then obtained by increasing the field until the magnetization reached at least 99.995% of its saturation value , @xmath37 .",
    "starting from this last value , the field was decreased to negative values at the same rate ( 200 monte carlo steps per @xmath36koe ) .",
    "the whole procedure was repeated 5 to 20 times , depending on the system size , for different random choices of easy magnetization axis directions , the averaged hysteresis curve was calculated , and the remanence , @xmath38 , was determined as the @xmath11 component of the magnetization for @xmath35 .",
    "we start our calculations considering lattices with @xmath4 layers of @xmath39 particles and @xmath40 , as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig - redes ] .",
    "these values of lattice parameter would correspond to a 20% concentration in a simple cubic system .",
    "[ fig - sq1 ] shows the thermal variation of the reduced remanence as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "layers ( full symbols ) , and for a noninteracting system ( open symbols ) . each layer is composed by @xmath39 particles , placed on a square lattice . the interlayer and",
    "intralayer nearest neighbor distance is @xmath41 the lines are guides to the eye .",
    "error bars are smaller than the symbols .",
    "[ fig - sq1 ] ]    one can see from this figure that the remanence of interacting systems exhibits a maximum at low temperatures , which is not present in the noninteracting particles curve . as shown in [ 17 ] for the @xmath42 system , the remanence peak separates distinct states of low magnetization . at low temperatures",
    "the absolute value of the dipolar energy is much larger than the thermal energy and an ordered state , due to the dipolar interaction , appears . in this case ,",
    "magnetization patterns at @xmath35 show a very small contribution of @xmath13 magnetization and antiparallel alignment between lines normal to the previous field direction , the @xmath12-axis in this case .",
    "the energy required to satisfy the dipolar coupling between lines parallel to the @xmath11-axis would be too large and an antiparallel alignment along the @xmath12-direction is favored . at the maximum ,",
    "the two energies are closer , and thermal fluctuations provide enough energy to destroy the low temperature @xmath12 dipolar order . at higher temperatures , the thermal energy dominates , leading to a significant increase of the @xmath13 component of the magnetization , also resulting in a low remanence value .",
    "this behavior is numerically well described by the average values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , defined as @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . at @xmath49k , averaging over 10 samples , we have the values @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , compatible with a mainly in - plane magnetization , with an important @xmath12 contribution due to the antiferromagnetic alignment . at the high temperature region , for example at @xmath53k , the average values are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , showing an increase of the out - of - plane component favored by thermal energy .",
    "the remanence curves for @xmath57 are similar to the @xmath42 curve , with two low magnetization regions , one at low temperatures dominated by the dipolar coupling , in which antiparallel alignment in the directions normal to the applied field is present , and a high temperature disordered state with magnetic moments randomly aligned .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig - sq1 ] that , as @xmath4 increases , for a given temperature the remanence decreases , and the peak slightly shifts to higher temperatures , being the interaction with out - of - plane neighbors the main cause of this behavior .",
    "regarding the ordered low temperature state , the presence of layers below and above a given plane offers an alternative direction for antiparallel alignment leading to a decrease of the remanence . due to the long range character of the interaction , the dipolar energy per particle increases with system size up to a saturation value , therefore",
    ", it is natural to expect that increasing the number of layers , the low temperature ordered state becomes more stable , reflecting in a shift of the peak position to higher temperatures .    in order to investigate the low temperature dependence on @xmath4",
    ", we have examined the magnetization patterns for systems with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig - snapq2 ] illustrates the behavior of the individual magnetic moments at @xmath60k , for surface layers of a @xmath58 system . in this case",
    ", there are two alternative directions for the antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but , as explained above , there is a predominance of the @xmath12 component since the number of neighbors in this direction is larger .",
    "this can be confirmed by looking at the average values of the magnetization components in the @xmath11,@xmath12 and @xmath13 directions . at @xmath61 , considering 10 samples , the average values for the whole lattice are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "clearly an antiparallel alignment on the @xmath68 plane occurs , which is stronger along the @xmath12 direction .     system .",
    "[ fig - snapq2 ] ]    for the @xmath59 system the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are equivalent directions for the antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "the amount of @xmath13 alignment increases at the expense of the @xmath11 contribution as can be seen from the average values for the lattice , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the behavior of the remanence as the values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 are varied .",
    "figure   [ fig - ay ] shows the remanence curves for @xmath42 systems with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . since the antiparallel order in the @xmath12 direction is the main reason for the low value of remanence at low temperatures , as the @xmath12 distance",
    "is increased , the magnetic moments can follow the field more easily , and the remanence increases .     in @xmath78 lattices .",
    "[ fig - ay ] ]    the effect of varying @xmath10 is evident when we compare systems with @xmath58 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 with a @xmath42 system .",
    "figure  [ fig - az ] illustrates the remanence curves for such systems , showing that , as the layers become more separated , the interlayer coupling decreases and the system approaches the @xmath42 behavior .     in @xmath81 lattices .",
    "the curve for a @xmath78 is also shown as a reference .",
    "[ fig - az ] ]      for layers with triangular symmetry , the number of in - plane neighbors is higher , so that any effects related to confinement of the magnetic moments in the @xmath6 plane are enhanced .",
    "figure  [ fig - tr1 ] shows the remanence curves for triangular lattices with @xmath82 , obtained under the same conditions as the curves in fig.[fig - sq1 ] .",
    "layers ( full symbols ) , and for a non interacting system ( open symbols ) . each layer is composed by @xmath39 particles placed on a triangular lattice . [ fig - tr1 ] ]    the remanence values are considerably larger than the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig - sq1 ] , which is compatible with the picture of smaller @xmath13 component .",
    "we also analyzed the magnetization pattern for typical configurations of these triangular systems .",
    "figure [ fig - tr2 ] shows snapshots of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of the individual magnetic moments at @xmath83 for @xmath84 . from this figure",
    "we can see that , at low temperature , the small value of the remanence is mainly caused by an antiferromagnetic ordering along the direction connecting the nearest neighbors clusters of the system .",
    "this effect , due to the predominance of the dipolar interaction , is stronger than in the square lattice since the number of in - plane nearest neighbors , 6 in this lattice , is higher , as compared to 4 in the square lattice .",
    "this behavior is numerically well described by the average values of magnetization components at @xmath85k : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , compatible with a mainly in - plane magnetization along the line joining nearest neighbors . at the high - temperature region ,",
    "the system is disordered and the @xmath13 component of the magnetization increases , leading to a low remanence region .     and",
    "@xmath85k , for a system of @xmath92 particles and triangular symmetry .",
    "the previous direction of the field is indicated by the arrow .",
    "[ fig - tr2 ] ]",
    "the above results confirm the existence of two low - remanence yet distinct behaviors , one at low temperature , where the dipolar energy dominates , and another , at higher temperatures , where the thermal energy is responsible of the magnetic disorder .",
    "the position and height of the peak separating those regimes is related to the strength of the dipolar interactions , and depends on the lattice geometry",
    ". as known , dipolar interactions favor closed circuit alignment , which may result in antiparallel alignments between lines of parallel magnetic moments in rectangular lattices . at low temperatures a small external magnetic field",
    "provides a prefered direction for the parallel coupling , leading to two possibilities of antiparallel alignment in 3d systems . on the other hand , for a 2d system , there is only one possible direction for the antiparallel alignment .",
    "figure [ fig - sq1 ] shows that for systems formed by sequential deposition of layers it is possible to observe a transition from the 2d to the 3d behavior as the number of layers increases . as an alternative direction for antiparallel alignment appears , the height of the remanence peak decreases reflecting the decrease of the magnetization along the field direction . also , for a given number of layers , the variation of the distance between magnetic particles and coordination number can drastically chance the effective dimensionality , as the dipolar interaction is enhanced along certain directions .",
    "figures [ fig - ay ] and [ fig - az ] show this dimensionality transition caused by variation of the lattice parameter , and figure [ fig - tr1 ] by the change in coordination number .",
    "these aspects are responsible for difficulties in the analysis of the hysteresis cycle , specially if one associates the area of the cycle to the stability of the magnetization moment .",
    "larger values of remanence are basically a consequence of a decrease in the number of degrees of freedom , due to the confinement of the magnetic moment to a plane or to a line .",
