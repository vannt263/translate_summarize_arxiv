    "the detected neutrino oscillations in atmospheric , solar and reactor neutrino experiments@xcite implies that neutrino has a non - zero absolute mass .",
    "if the neutrino does have the absolute mass , it will be the lowest energy particle in the extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the determination of the neutrino mass therefore is one of the greatest unsolved problems in modern physics .",
    "however , the neutrino experiments are able to place a lower limit on the effective neutrino mass , which depends on the hierarchy of the neutrino mass spectra@xcite(also see@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the laboratory experiments can not exactly pin down the absolute mass scale of neutrinos .    on the other hand , cosmological constraints on the neutrino mass are highly complementary to particle physics .",
    "cosmology provides a unique laboratory for studying neutrino mass .",
    "the neutrino mass has already been constrained up to an unprecedented accuracy simply by the cosmological probes  @xcite .",
    "it is even more promising that the allowed neutrino mass window could be closed by forthcoming cosmological surveys  @xcite . despite the notable success in this effort ,",
    "the cosmological neutrino constraints are highly model dependent .",
    "the current constraints are usually obtained in the context of a @xmath3cdm model or a dynamical dark energy model  @xcite .",
    "it is important to test the robustness of such constraints against assumptions about the nature of gravity and dark energy .",
    "the observed cosmic acceleration may also be explained without dark energy if our theory of gravity is modified .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to study cosmological neutrino constraints in the framework of modified gravity .",
    "the impact of massive neutrinos on the linear growth history in the @xmath0 gravity has been studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "strong degeneracy has been found between the late time growth of the @xmath0 gravity and the massive neutrinos@xcite .",
    "such degeneracy has also been found at the non - linear level based on n - body simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus , tighter constraints on the neutrino mass can only be achieved if there is an independent constraint on the neutrino mass or the modified gravity models are well constrained by the local tests of gravity .    very recently",
    ", bicep2 group have announced a robust detection on the @xmath4mode power spectrum in the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) at a significance of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the finding provides the long - sought evidence of inflation and the first detection of gravitational waves action on matter .",
    "the detection of gravitational waves also provide an unique opportunity to break the degeneracy between the massive neutrino and modified gravity .",
    "the reason for this is that , as we shall show later in this paper , the @xmath0 gravity has insignificant impact on the evolution of the tensor perturbation .",
    "however , the massive neutrinos contribute directly to the anisotropic stress and has direct impact on the angular power spectra of the b - mode .",
    "the measurement of the b - modes thus can break the degeneracy between the massive neutrinos and modified gravity .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to test the robustness of the measurement of the b - modes from bicep2 in breaking such degeneracy .",
    "we will discuss the tensor perturbation in the @xmath0 gravity first and then constrain the neutrino mass using the observations from bicep2  @xcite , planck  @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) surveys .",
