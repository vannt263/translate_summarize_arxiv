    "the measurement of the @xmath0 boson mass with the cdf detector  @xcite at the fermilab tevatron @xmath1 collider achieves a precision of one part per 10,000 on the measured energy of muons from @xmath0 boson decays  @xcite .",
    "a key component of the momentum calibration is a precise relative alignment of the wires in the cdf drift chamber . in this paper",
    "we describe the alignment technique developed at cdf using cosmic rays collected _ in situ _ with collider operation .",
    "this technique was initiated in 2002 and used to perform the alignment for the first two measurements of the @xmath0 boson mass from the cdf run ii data , based on 200 pb@xmath2  @xcite and 2.2 fb@xmath2  @xcite of integrated luminosity , respectively .",
    "we also present the results from the alignment analysis performed most recently using cosmic rays collected during the entire run ii collider operation , to be used in the next @xmath0-boson mass measurement at cdf .",
    "the momentum calibration  @xcite is performed in two steps .",
    "first , the selected cosmic - ray sample is reconstructed using special pattern - recognition and track - fitting algorithms that reconstruct the complete cosmic - ray trajectory through both halves of the drift chamber .",
    "these algorithms and their performance are described in  @xcite .",
    "this fitted trajectory proves an excellent reference , with respect to which the average hit residuals can be minimized to achieve an internal alignment of the wires .",
    "certain degrees of freedom associated with deformations of the tracker endplates can not be constrained by minimizing residuals with respect to collider tracks .",
    "examples of such deformations are relative rotations of the inner and outer cylinders of the drift chamber , and relative twists of the east and west endplates",
    ". they result in parameter biases in collider track fits but do not result in displaced residuals . on the other hand",
    ", such deformations result in differences between the trajectories on the two sides of the drift chamber of the same cosmic ray , and can be constrained by using the complete two - sided helix fit .",
    "this property is exploited to remove a number of important sources of bias in the measurement of collider tracks .    in the second step of the calibration , @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 mass peaks are reconstructed with the above alignment . using the precisely known masses of these particles , a momentum scale factor and the ionization energy loss model",
    "are tuned simultaneously in the simulation , and then applied to the @xmath0 boson mass measurement  @xcite .",
    "residual misalignments that can not be constrained with cosmic - ray tracks are corrected using the ratio of calorimeter energy to track momentum of electrons and positrons from @xmath0-boson decays  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we describe the procedure and the results obtained from the cosmic ray alignment . in sec .",

    "the central tracking drift chamber  @xcite ( cot ) uses an open - cell geometry with 30,240 sense wires .",
    "its tracking volume extends from an inner radius of 41 cm to an outer radius of 138 cm , with a longitudinal extent of 310  cm .",
    "a superconducting solenoid immediately outside the cot provides a nearly uniform 1.4  t magnetic field in the tracking volume . within",
    "the cot sits a silicon detector to provide precise vertexing information . in the measurement of the @xmath0-boson mass ,",
    "the momentum of the charged lepton produced promptly in the collision is measured using cot information and constrained to the beam collision region in the transverse plane ; silicon detector hits do not improve the precision on the beam - constrained track parameters and are not used .    13.0 cm    a section of one of the aluminum endplates of the cot",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cot ] .",
    "the drift chamber consists of 2520 drift cells , each containing 12 sense wires .",
    "the maximum drift distance is @xmath5  mm .",
    "the cells are arranged in 8 radial superlayers ( sl0 to sl7 ) , with the number of cells per superlayer increasing with radius .",
    "alternating superlayers consist of wires running along the longitudinal axis ( axial superlayers ) and wires with a @xmath6 stereo angle ( stereo superlayers ) .",
    "the stereo angle changes sign from one stereo superlayer to the next .",
    "12.0 cm    the radial spacing between sense wires in a cell is 5.8  mm  @xcite .",
    "the wires are attached at their ends to rigid cards which are precision - mounted on the cot endplates . in the alignment model ,",
    "each cell s profile at the endplates is described by a straight line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cotcell ] ) .",
    "thus , the degrees of freedom to be constrained in order to precisely locate each sense wire at each endplate are the following :    1 .",
    "the transverse @xmath7 coordinates of the center of each cell , at the longitudinal ( @xmath8 ) coordinate @xmath9  cm of the two endplates .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath10 of each cell relative to the radial vector from the transverse origin to the center of the cell at @xmath11  cm .    10.0 cm    we parameterize the former degrees of freedom in terms of symmetrized ( i.e. averaged over the two endplates ) and anti - symmetrized ( i.e. difference between the two endplates ) cell - center coordinates .",
    "the advantage of these definitions is that the symmetrized and anti - symmetrized cell - coordinate residuals are , to a large extent , uncorrelated because of the approximately uniform and symmetric distribution of the cosmic rays in the @xmath8-coordinate .",
    "the symmetrized cell - coordinate residuals are averaged over @xmath8 , while the anti - symmetrized corrections are sensitive to the dependence of the hit residuals on the @xmath8-coordinate .",
    "the cell - tilt angle ( @xmath12 ) is designed to account for the lorentz angle of the drift direction given the magnitude of the electric field , the spectrometer magnetic field and the drift speed .",
    "the alignment corrects for small deviations in the cell tilt .",
    "the corrections are found to be almost the same for the two endplates .",
    "we compute the average correction to the cell tilt since the difference between the tilt corrections for the two endplates has negligible impact on tracking biases .",
    "finally , the functional forms describing the wire shape as a function of @xmath8 , and its variation with azimuth and radius , are also tuned .",
    "these degrees of freedom are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : wireshape ] .",
    "the cosmic ray sample used in this study is collected during collider operation by high-@xmath13  @xcite muon physics triggers , ensuring that the cosmic rays and collider tracks are recorded under the same operating conditions for the drift chamber and the spectrometer . in order to isolate a clean and unambiguous sample of cosmic rays , we require that only one or two tracks be reconstructed in the event , and that at least one of them is tagged as a muon by the presence of a matching track segment reconstructed in the muon detectors .",
    "these criteria efficiently select those cosmic - ray events which coincide in time with beam crossings in which no proton - antiproton collisions occurred .",
    "a display of such a cosmic - ray event is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmicray ] .",
    "after all requirements , a sample of 207,023 cosmic - ray events is selected for the alignment study .    17.0 cm    the spatial and temporal distributions of the cosmic rays are shown in fig .  [ fig : distributions ] .",

    "the residuals with respect to the two - sided helical track fit ( referred to as the `` dicosmic track '' ) are an unbiased measurement of relative misalignments of the sense wires if and only if the true parameters of the cosmic ray trajectory are the same on the two sides of the cot . in this case",
    ", fitting the hits on both sides with a single helix represents a valid model of the muon s trajectory . in practice",
    ", the muon loses on average @xmath14  mev of energy while passing through the silicon tracking detector . as a result ,",
    "the latter half of the trajectory has lower momentum and the hit residuals will be biased with respect to the dicosmic track .",
    "fortunately , this bias is in opposite directions for positive and negative tracks .",
    "we weight the positive and negative muons in inverse proportion to their relative rates such that the average curvature ( defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the charge and @xmath13 is the transverse momentum ) of the reweighted combined sample is zero . as a result",
    ", the average residuals correspond to those of infinite - momentum tracks , and are not influenced by the energy loss .",

    "after seeding and associating hits to the dicosmic track , the dicosmic track fit  @xcite allows the direction of propagation and the time of incidence of the cosmic ray to be free parameters . to ensure full containment in the cot",

    "[ fig : dicosmicnhits ] , the efficiency of associating hits ( from a maximum possible 192 hits ) with the dicosmic track is @xmath18% for this sample .",
    "in addition to the cosmic - ray hypothesis , two additional hypotheses are also tested in the dicosmic fit : a pair of outgoing back - to - back tracks ( as could be produced from a two - body decay at rest ) , and a pair of incoming tracks ( indicating a reconstruction problem in one of the two track segments ) .",
    "we require the cosmic - ray hypothesis to be the @xmath19-minimizing hypothesis .",

    "the starting point for obtaining the alignment correction constants is the cell - position measurements  @xcite made using a coordinate - measuring machine ( cmm ) .",
    "the cell - tilt angles were updated using a calculation  @xcite based on a finite - element analysis ( fea ) which predicted a cell - tilt correction of 1.5 mrad .",
