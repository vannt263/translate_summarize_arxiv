    "the periodic pattern is constructed of pigment cells with different colors .",
    "the different types of pigment cells are mutually competitive .",
    "on the other hand , there are several observations that various types of cells are differentiated during the developmental process , but the number ratio of the different cell types does not change very much as the body size increases .",
    "a typical example is the cellular slime mold dictyostelium discoideum .",
    "the amoebic state changes to the fruiting body via the migrating slug state , if the breeding condition becomes worse .",
    "prespore cells and prestalk cells are differentiated in the process .",
    "the number ratio is kept almost constant even if the body size is changed  @xcite .",
    "the ratio control and the pattern formation are performed in two steps . in an early stage ,",
    "the ratio of the two - type cells is regulated by dif ( differentiation inducing factor ) , and later prestalk cells move into a tip region within the slug through a chemotaxis by the camp  @xcite . the two cell types , i.e. , the prespore and the prestalk are competitive in this system .",
    "another example is the differentiation of blood cells from the stem cells in the bone marrow .",
    "the number ratio of the red blood cells , the white blood cells , and the platelets is kept to be roughly constant .",
    "another typical rule of the cell differentiation is a cascade control of the differentiation process by complicated gene networks . in the segmentation process of the drosophila",
    ", the differentiation proceeds from a large scale to a small scale in a hierarchical manner .",

    "the analyses of the specific gene network and the pattern formation for each system are important in the developmental biology . however , in this paper , we consider a very simple cascade model of competitive reaction - diffusion equations and propose a mechanism of the ratio control from a view point of the nonlinear dynamics .     for eq .",

    "if two cell - types are mutually competitive , only one type of cells are locally activated by the lateral inhibition .",
    "the two cell - types are bistable , and a homogeneous state of one - type cell will appear . however , if some long - range enhancement of the competitive type is included in the system , two types of cells will appear in a large system .",
    "meinhardt and gierer proposed a model of the mutual induction of locally exclusive states , and generated a stripe - like pattern  @xcite .",
    "we study first a simplified version of their model .",
    "the model is written as coupled reaction - diffusion equations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are positive parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 obey the hill type equation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are produced respectively from @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the hill type equation is often used in the biochemistry and the gene regulatory network  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement and the suppression of the reaction are expressed in the numerator and the denominator in the first term of on the right - hand side of the hill equation .",
    "that is , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 acts as activators for themselves by the terms of @xmath20 or @xmath21 , and acts as inhibitors for the other by the term of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "it means that the morphogens @xmath18 and @xmath19 diffuse rapidly and work as long - range activators respectively for @xmath5 and @xmath4 .    there is a uniform solution @xmath30 to eq .",
    "it is expected that @xmath5 is depressed when @xmath4 increases locally and vice versa , because @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mutually competitive . if the perturbation of the form : @xmath31 are assumed owing to the competitive relation , the deviations @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy @xmath34 the eigenvalue @xmath35 can be calculated from eq .",

    "figure 1(b ) shows stationary profiles of @xmath40 ( solid curve ) and @xmath41 ( dashed curve ) at @xmath10 and @xmath36 . a spatially periodic pattern appears , in which the @xmath4-dominant region and @xmath5-dominant region reciprocate spatially . this is a turing pattern in the competitive reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "note that the @xmath42 component with large diffusivity acts as activators for the competitor , and it facilitates the competitor in spatially distant regions .",
    "it is different from the usual turing pattern in usual activator - inhibitor systems , where the inhibitor with large diffusivity inhibits the activator .",
    "the mechansim of the pattern formation by the long - range activation of the competitor is essentially the same as the model proposed by meinhardt and gierer almost 30 years ago  @xcite .",
    "kondo and asai performed a numerical simulation of the usual type of activator - inhibitor system to explain the skin pattern of the tropical fish  @xcite , but our model might be more plausible for the pattern formation , because the pigment cells are mutually competitive .",
    "next , we generalize the model equation ( 1 ) to a model equation in which the whole system is separated into two regions of @xmath4-dominant region and @xmath5-dominant region .",

    "for this initial condition , the whole space is separated into the @xmath4-dominant region at @xmath56 and the @xmath5-dominant region at @xmath57 .",
    "there are domain walls between the two domains .",
    "however , even if the initial condition is random , the whole space is separated into the two regions with the same size , although the position of the @xmath4-dominant region becomes random .",
    "it is because @xmath35 takes a maximum value at @xmath53 .",
    "if the initial condition is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , four domains , i.e. , two @xmath4-dominant regions and two @xmath5-dominant regions appear initially , however , there is an attractive interaction between the domain walls and finally the two - domain structure is obtained as shown in fig.2(c ) .",
    "the time evolution is similar to the coarsening process in the one - dimensional ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation : @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "however , it is different from the gl system in that the final state is a uniform state in the gl system and the final state is a two - domain state in our system .",
    "it is a unique point in our model that the two - domain structure of equal size appears naturally for any system size @xmath59 .",

    "the sizes of the @xmath4-dominant region and the @xmath5-dominant region are not the same in this asymmetric model . however , the maximum and the minimum values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the width of the domain walls are almost the same , which are expressed as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are assumed to takes constant values and @xmath67 , a domain wall between a @xmath4-dominant region and a @xmath5-dominant region moves as the @xmath4-dominant region shrinks , which is similar to the motion of the domain wall in the asymmetric ginzburg - landau equation : @xmath68 .",
    "however , if the @xmath4-dominant region shrinks , @xmath69 decreases and @xmath70 increases in time in our system .",
    "this is due to a negative feedback effect involved in our system .",
    "finally , the domain walls become stationary , when @xmath71 is satisfied .",
    "if the system size @xmath59 is sufficiently large , the ratio @xmath72 of the domain size @xmath73 of the @xmath4-dominated region is evaluated from the condition @xmath71 as @xmath74 because @xmath75 and @xmath76 , if the width of domain walls is not taken into consideration . if @xmath77 , @xmath78 is approximated at @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the size ratio is determined by the ratio of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath61 and does not depend on the system size @xmath59 .",
    "we studied the control of the domain size in the ginzburg - landau type equation in the previous work , which was the same mechanism as the present one  @xcite .",
