    "@xmath0 the transversity function , @xmath1 , may yield nontrivial information on the nucleon structure .",
    "however , such a distribution is quite difficult to determine experimentally .",
    "in fact , in the last years , the problem has been debated at length@xcite ; moreover , the data analysis of the recent hermes experiment@xcite has met serious difficulties . in this situation",
    "any observable sensitive to @xmath1 should be taken into account .",
    "the aim of the present talk is to illustrate one such observable , consisting of a double spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , using a transversely polarized proton and a longitudinally polarized charged lepton .",
    "we shall also review the various methods proposed in the literature for determining @xmath1 , referring in particular to sidis , which presents some advantages over the other kinds of reactions .    in sect .",
    "2 we recall the definition of @xmath1 and illustrate the kind of information we may extract from this function . in sect .",
    "3 we show the difficulties concerning the measurement of the transversity function . moreover we give a short review of the various methods suggested in the literature , referring , in particular , to the sidis single spin asymmetry measured in the hermes experiment@xcite . as an alternative , in sect .",
    "4 , we examine the possibility of a sidis double spin asymmetry .",
    "we consider two different cases , according as to whether the direction of the final hadron is fixed or not .",
    "we treat in detail the former case , suggesting an alternative experiment for extracting @xmath1 .",
    "lastly in sect .",
    "5 we present numerical estimates of the asymmetry illustrated in sect .",
    "4 and give a short summary .",
    "the transversity function@xcite is defined ( see _ e. g. _ , jaffe and ji@xcite ) in terms of the tensor dirac operator @xmath2 . in order to understand the physical meaning of this distribution function ,",
    "it is convenient to decompose the quark field into terms of given transversity . in a reference frame where the proton has a very large momentum directed perpendicularly to its polarization",
    ", it results that , for a given flavor @xmath3 and longitudinal fractional momentum @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the difference between the number density of quarks with spin aligned along the proton spin and the number density of quarks with opposite spin . using different projection operators@xcite , we can establish two important properties of the transversity function , _ i. e. _ , that    \\(i ) @xmath6 is a twist - two distribution function , which amounts to saying that it survives in the scaling limit ;    \\(ii ) @xmath6 is chiral - odd , which makes it difficult to determine experimentally this function , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "this distribution is different from the helicity distribution @xmath7 , for which one has to consider a proton travelling in the direction of its spin .",
    "the reason is that generally a lorentz boost does not commute with a rotation .",
    "this would be the case , and the two distributions @xmath1 = @xmath8 and @xmath9 = @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the fractional charge of the quark ) would coincide , if the dynamics of the quarks inside the proton were non - relativistic .",
    "but we know that it is not so , because of the quark confinement and of the heisenbrg principle ; furthermore some predictions of the non - relativistic quark model fail , like the value of the axial charge .",
    "therefore we may really expect nontrivial information on the nucleon structure from the determination of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , some authors@xcite have stressed the importance of transverse momentum in the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",
    "they have shown , in the framework of the constituent quark model , that the quark tranverse momentum induces nontrivial melosh - wigner rotations , owing to the boost from the proton rest frame to the infinite momentum frame .",
    "this causes a spin dilution both in @xmath9 and in @xmath1 .",
    "this dilution , in turn , may explain@xcite , at least partially , the so - called spin crisis , consisting of a surprisingly small value , found by the emc collaboration in 1987@xcite , of the first moment of @xmath9 . but according to the model the dilution is less marked in @xmath1 than in @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the determination of @xmath1 , compared with @xmath9 , may shed indirectly some light on the spin crisis .",
    "furthermore , this determination could allow an important test for a qcd prediction on the @xmath12 dependence of the two distribution functions .",
    "indeed , while the qcd evolution of the singlet part of @xmath9 is coupled to the gluon polarization , which may produce sensible scaling violations , such an effect should be absent in @xmath1 .",
    "the difficulties in determining the transversity function are connected with its chiral - odd character .",
    "indeed a massless quark conserves its chirality under any type of interactions , either electroweak or strong .",
    "it follows that , if a given asymmetry is sensitive to this function , it must depend on the product of @xmath1 by another chiral - odd function .",
    "therefore we have to consider reactions in which two hadrons are involved , either in the initial or in the final state .",
    "totally inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is by no means suitable for determining @xmath1 .",
    "the double spin asymmetry in drell - yan ( dy ) , with two transversely polarized proton beams , results to be proportional to@xcite @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the longitudinal fractional momenta of , respectively , the active quark and antiquark that annihilate into a timelike photon . here",
    "the drawback is that this asymmetry is quite small ( 1 - 2 % at most@xcite ) , moreover , presumably , @xmath16",
    "@xmath17 @xmath18 , since the antiquark necessarily belongs to the sea .",
    "something we could gain using a polarized antiproton beam@xcite instead of one of the two proton beams , but for the moment this kind of experiment looks quite unrealistic .",
    "more promising look asymmetry experiments based on sidis , that is , on reactions of the type @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a charged lepton and @xmath21 a hadron .",
    "the proton target is polarized , which yields information on the polarization of the initial active quark . if also the lepton beam is polarized@xcite , or if the final hadron is a spinning , unstable particle , whose decay may be detected@xcite , we are faced with a double spin asymmetry .",
    "this allows to get information on the final quark polarization and , in principle , to extract @xmath1 .",
    "but even a single spin asymmetry , _ i. e. _ , with an unpolarized lepton beam , may be sensitive to the the final quark polarization , provided we are able to exploit the so - called collins effect@xcite in the angular distribution of @xmath21 .",
    "a single spin asymmetry is proportional to a mixed product of the type @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the proton spin and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are any two ( non collinear ) momenta of the particles involved in the reaction .",
    "this object is invariant under parity inversion , but changes sign under time reversal . in other words ,",
    "the cross section contains a @xmath26-odd term .",
    "this can only come from the interference between two amplitudes with different phases . in reaction ( [ reaz ] ) , this interference is produced by the final - state interaction between @xmath21 and other hadrons in the final state . therefore in this case it is the fragmentation function of @xmath21 that has a @xmath26-odd part , sensitive to the polarization of the fragmenting quark , as follows from the above mixed product . here",
    "we identify @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the momenta , respectively , of the final quark and of @xmath21 , and approximate the quark momentum by the momentum @xmath27 of the virtual photon",
    ". then the problem amounts to determining the @xmath26-odd part of the fragmentation function .    to this end , consider the transverse momentum dependent ( t.m.d . ) fragmentation function of the final hadron , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the longitudinal fractional momentum and the transverse momentum of the pion with respect to the fragmenting quark .",
    "while the usual fragmentation function , @xmath31 , is obtained simply by integrating @xmath32 over the tranverse momentum , the @xmath26-odd part can be extracted by weighing @xmath32 with the above mixed product , that is , @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the momentum of the hadron @xmath21 .",
    "moreover @xmath35 , the so - called collins angle , is defined as the azimuthal angle between the ( @xmath36 ) plane and the ( @xmath37 ) plane .",
    "notice that the @xmath26-odd fragmentation function is also chiral - odd .",
    "the collins effect has been exploited in the recently realized hermes experiment@xcite , where a longitudinally polarized proton has been used , and it is also invoked for the planned hermes experiment@xcite with a transversely polarized target .",
    "the asymmetries , respectively twist-3 and twist-2 , are both sensitive to the product @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the transversity function may be determined , provided we are able to extract the collins fragmentation function from an independent experiment . in any case",
    ", a confirmation of the effect predicted by collins comes both from hermes data on the sidis single spin asymmetry@xcite and from @xmath39 decay into two jets@xcite .",
    "variants of the collins effect are the jet transversity determination@xcite in dis and the two - pion interference method@xcite , applicable both to sidis and to proton - proton collisions .",
    "alternatively we can , in principle , extract @xmath1 from a sidis double spin asymmetry experiment , employing a transversely polarized proton target and a longitudinally polarized lepton beam , and detecting a pion in the final state .",
    "the asymmetry is defined as @xmath40 where the arrows denote the the proton and lepton polarizations .",
    "two kinds of experiments are possible , that is , fixing the final pion direction , or integrating the cross section over the pion transverse momentum with respect to the fragmenting quark .",
    "the latter possibility has been considered by jaffe and ji@xcite ( jj ) .",
    "the asymmetry they calculate contains twist 3 and twist 4 terms , the latters including the product @xmath41 ; here @xmath42 is the twist-3 fragmentation function of the pion , a chiral - odd function .",
    "therefore , again , the determination of @xmath1 is subordinated to the knowledge , from an independent experiment , of another nonperturbative ( and rather unusual ) function .",
    "if we keep the final pion direction fixed , the asymmetry contains one more twist 3 term , which disappears upon integration over the pion transverse momentum .",
    "this term survives for @xmath43 = 0 , where the other terms - corresponding to the jj asymmetry - vanish . moreover , under this condition , such a term is sensitive to the t.m.d .",
    "transversity function , @xmath44 .",
    "this can be intuitively seen by observing that , in this case , owing to the transverse momentum of the parton inside the hadron , the transverse polarization of the proton induces a longitudinal polarization in the active quark , which may be related to @xmath44 . in principle there could be cancellations due to symmetries ( _ e . g. _ , under rotation , parity inversion , etc . ) , but under the conditions we shall impose this does not occur .",
    "the situation is quite analogous to the one described in ref.@xcite .",
    "there we considered a dy reaction of the type @xmath45 where we assumed to have one transversely polarized proton beam and to detect the longitudinal polarization of one final muon . in that case the asymmetry - which turns out to be the polarization of one of the muons - is non - zero , provided we consider nonvanishing , fixed values of the transverse momentum of the virtual photon with respect to the proton beams in the laboratory frame . since a sidis reaction is kinematically isomorphic to dy , a similar effect occurs in the case considered , as we are going to show .    to this end",
    "we calculate the double spin asymmetry ( [ as0 ] ) , taking @xmath43 = 0 . in one - photon exchange approximation",
    "the differential cross section is of the type @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the leptonic and the hadronic tensor respectively .",
    "the leptonic tensor reads , in the massless approximation , @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are respectively the four - momentum and the helicity of the initial lepton , @xmath52 = @xmath53 the four - momentum of the final lepton and @xmath54 the four - momentum of the virtual photon .      to calculate the asymmetry ( [ as0 ] ) , we substitute eqs .",
    "( [ dsg ] ) to ( [ dens ] ) into that expression , resulting in@xcite @xmath72 here we have set @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are , respectively , the initial and final energy of the lepton .",
    "moreover we have introduced the quantities @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 is the t.m.d .",
    "unpolarized quark distribution .",
    "we have slightly changed our notation , considering separately , for each flavor , the quark ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) and antiquark ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) contribution , the barred quantities being defined analogously to eqs .",
    "( [ qf ] ) and ( [ dqf ] ) .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "\\(i ) invariance of strong interactions under parity , time reversal and rotations ( in particular rotations of @xmath83 around the proton momentum ) implies @xmath84 this relation has two important consequences .",
    "first of all the integral at the r. h. s. of eq .",
    "( [ dqf ] ) vanishes for @xmath68 = 0 , therefore @xmath80 is proportional to the the scalar product @xmath85 . secondly ,",
    "if we consider totally inclusive dis - which amounts to replacing @xmath32 @xmath86 1 - , the integral ( [ dqf ] ) is washed out by integration over transverse momentum .",
    "\\(ii ) it is worth observing that , owing to the non - collinearity of the quark with respect to the proton , the t.m.d .",
    "transversity function includes , unlike @xmath1 , a chiral - even term , which can be calculated by changing the quantization axis from the proton momentum to the quark momentum .",
    "it is just such a chiral - even function that appears in formula ( [ dqf ] ) ; this is why our asymmetry formula ( [ assidis ] ) , unlike the other asymmetries considered in the literature , does not contain any chiral - odd distribution or fragmentation functions .",
    "\\(iii ) gauge invariance implies that qcd first order corrections , in particular graphs with one gluon exchange@xcite , contribute to the above mentioned asymmetry .",
    "however a calculation in the light cone gauge@xcite assures that such contributions are about @xmath87 of the zero order terms .",
    "\\(iv ) lastly the twist-3 character of the asymmetry ( [ assidis ] ) - which can be immediately checked from eq .",
    "( [ dqf ] ) - forces us to pick up not too large values of @xmath12 ( @xmath66 10 @xmath88 ) .",
    "however this is not a serious limitation with respect to the twist-2 azimuthal asymmetries , which are plagued by a strong sudakov suppression@xcite at large @xmath12 .",
    "here we calculate the order of magnitude of the asymmetry ( [ assidis ] ) . to this end",
    "we assume@xcite @xmath78 , @xmath89 and @xmath32 to have a gaussian transverse momentum dependence , with the same width parameter",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ assidis ] ) results in @xmath90 } { \\sum_f e^2_f\\left[q^f(x)d^f(z)+\\bar{q}^f(x)\\bar{d}^f(z)\\right]}.\\label{formu}\\ ] ] taking into account eq .",
    "( [ formu ] ) and the second eq .",
    "( [ assidis ] ) , we see that the optimal conditions for measuring the asymmetry are ( i ) @xmath91 and @xmath29 as close to 1 as possible and ( ii ) the pion transverse momentum relative to the photon parallel to the proton polarization . under such conditions , and taking @xmath92 @xmath71 and @xmath93 = 2.5 @xmath71 , we have @xmath94 , where @xmath95 has been determined by hermes@xcite , @xmath96 .    to summarize , first of all , we have shortly reviewed the methods proposed in the literature for determining @xmath1 .",
    "then we have suggested a sidis experiment , with a longitudinally polarized lepton and a transversely polarized proton , detecting a pion in the final state .",
    "we demand to pick up events such that the lepton scattering plane is orthogonal to the proton polarization ; moreover we select pions produced in a fixed direction and at not too large angles with respect to the virtual photon momentum .",
    "the relative asymmetry is sensitive to the t.m.d .",
    "transversity function , but , unlike the other methods proposed in the literature , it does not involve any other unknown functions .",
    "the t.m.d .",
    "functions @xmath78 and @xmath32 involved in asymmetry ( [ assidis ] ) can be parametrized in a well determined way .",
    "this asymmetry is estimated to be , for not too large values of @xmath12 and under favourable kinematic conditions , at least @xmath97",
    ". the experiment could be performed at some facilities , like cern ( compass coll . ) , desy ( hermes coll . ) or jefferson laboratory , where similar asymmetry measurements have been realized or planned .",
