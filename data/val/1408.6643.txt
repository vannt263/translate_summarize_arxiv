    "figure [ fig : flowmo ] shows the time - integrated flows in the tracer that produces the main fraction of @xmath0mo .",
    "the flow pattern is less complex than in the case of @xmath0nb .",
    "the main contribution to this nuclide ( about 50% ) is through ( @xmath9,n ) sequences coming from the stable mo isotopes with mass numbers @xmath66 . these are mainly producing @xmath63mo , part of which is converted to @xmath0mo through the reaction sequence @xmath63mo(@xmath9,n)@xmath32mo(@xmath9,n)@xmath0mo . the slower reaction in this sequence , determining the flow is @xmath63mo(@xmath9,n)@xmath32mo , leaving an unpaired neutron in @xmath32mo .",
    "the second important path , contributing about 35% , is the sequence @xmath32nb(p , n)@xmath32mo(@xmath9,n)@xmath0mo .",
    "although the magnitude of the ( p , n ) reaction also scales with the proton density , the @xmath32mo(@xmath9,n)@xmath0mo reaction is the faster one again in this sequence at our snia conditions .",
    "finally , the reaction @xmath62nb(p,@xmath9 ) provides a small ( 15% ) , additional contribution to @xmath0mo .",
    "there are only theoretical predictions for the rates that are important , @xmath63mo(@xmath9,n)@xmath32mo , @xmath32nb(p , n)@xmath0mo , and ( with lower impact ) @xmath62nb(p,@xmath9)@xmath0mo .",
    "the @xmath0mo production would scale according to the above weights when new rate determinations become available for these reactions .",
    "the important theoretically estimated rates affecting the production of @xmath0nd and @xmath0mo are summarized in table [ tab : nbmoratio ] . in order to check the uncertainty in our gce calculations at the solar system birth for the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio due to uncertainties in the reaction rates",
    ", we varied the most important rates found above by a factor of two .",
    "calculations with two rate sets were performed , probing the extremal values expected for the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio as indicated in table [ tab : nbmoratio ] .",
    "this leads to a @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio at 9.2 gyr varying from 1.660@xmath30 10@xmath36 for the _ rate set min _ up to 3.118@xmath30 10@xmath36 for the _ rate set max _ ( the results are summarized in the last line of table [ tab : nbmoratio ] ) .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the snia yields calculated here , when folded in a galactic chemical evolution , given nuclear physics uncertainties , we can reproduce the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo and @xmath2sm/@xmath20sm ratios at solar system birth measured in meteorites ( @xmath67 in meteorites _",
    "1.8@xmath68 predicted ; ( @xmath69 in meteorites _",
    "vs_. 7.0@xmath70 predicted ) .",
    "note that the match between predicted and measured ratios requires that the material that made the solar system had not been isolated from fresh nucleosynthetic inputs for some extended time , as is observed for some @xmath6-process short - lived nuclides such as @xmath71i ( qian et al .",
    "these authors concluded that the discrepancy can be solved if some @xmath6-process isotopes are produced in rare events only .",
    "this study supports the view that single - degenerate snia may be important contributors to the nucleosynthesis of @xmath5-process nuclides in the galaxy .",
    "in this work we discuss the production of short - lived radionuclides @xmath0nb , @xmath2sm and @xmath1tc by single degenerate snia stars . using a simple galactic chemical evolution code ,",
    "we show that a significant fraction of @xmath5-process extinct radionuclides @xmath0nb , @xmath2sm , and @xmath38tc in meteorites could have been produced by the @xmath9-process in sneia .",
    "travaglio et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that snia were likely sites for @xmath5-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "in particular , enrichment in @xmath3-seeds during the pre - explosive evolution leads to the production of @xmath0mo , @xmath63mo , @xmath64ru and @xmath17ru , @xmath5-process isotopes that exist in high abundance in the cosmos and are difficult to reproduce in previous nucleosynthesis models . dauphas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) pointed out that a critical test that models of @xmath5-process nucleosynthesis must pass is that they must reproduce the abundances of the short - lived nuclides @xmath0nb and @xmath2sm .",
    "in particular , @xmath0nb provides strong constraints on @xmath5-process nucleosynthesis because it is shielded by @xmath0mo from decays of proton - rich progenitor nuclides and thus can not be produced by processes on the proton - rich side of the nuclear chart , such as the @xmath33- or @xmath72-processes .",
    "we should note that the nature of sn  ia progenitors remains still uncertain .",
    "following the idea of li et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and jimenez et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we supposed that at least 50% of sn  ia are single degenerate standard chandrasekhar mass .",
    "but the reader has to keep in mind that they can be more rare .",
    "referring to ruiter et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and ruiter et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , population synthesis models tells us that sn  ia progenitors come from a ( rare ) sample of common - envelope phase binaries which may or may not undergo some @xmath3-processing before the explosion .",
    "if they do , the outcome would be pretty much the same as in the chandrasekhar mass models and gce results would not change so much with respect to what we presented in this paper .",
    "a detailed analysis of double degenerate scenario as well as mergers as sn  ia progenitors will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    under the above conditions , we show here that sn  ia can reproduce the abundances of both @xmath0nb and @xmath2sm in meteorites within a factor of @xmath432 . the match would be poorer if solar system material had been isolated from fresh nucleosynthetic inputs for a long time .",
    "a detailed investigation of nuclear uncertainties affecting the reaction rates producing and destroying @xmath0nb , @xmath0mo , and @xmath2sm is presented .",
    "we found that the calculated @xmath2sm/@xmath20sm ratio was compatible with the meteoritic value when using a @xmath56gd(@xmath9,@xmath11 ) rate based either on a fit to the somorjai et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( @xmath11,@xmath9 ) cross sections or on the recent rate including an additional reaction channel as presented by rauscher ( 2013 ) .",
    "concerning @xmath0nb , the most important reactions affecting the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio were discussed and the impact of their nuclear uncertainties explored . the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio at 9.2 gyr ranges between @xmath73 and @xmath74 due to the nuclear uncertainties .",
    "this demonstrates that the meteoritic value can be reproduced within these uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that snia can play a key role in explaining meteoritic abundances of the extinct radioactivities @xmath0nb and @xmath2sm but that nuclear uncertainties still have considerable impact .",
