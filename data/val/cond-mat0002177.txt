    "recently , there is much interest in the dynamics of traffic breakdowns behind bottlenecks @xcite . measurements of traffic breakdowns on various freeways in the usa @xcite , germany , @xcite , holland @xcite , and korea @xcite suggest that many dynamic aspects are universal and therefore accessible to a physical description .",
    "one common property is the capacity drop ( typically of the order of 20% ) associated with a breakdown @xcite , which leads to hysteresis effects and is the basis of applications like dynamic traffic control with the aim of avoiding the breakdown . in the majority of cases , traffic breaks down upstream of a bottleneck and the congestion has a stationary donstream front at the bottleneck .",
    "the type of bottleneck , e.g. , on - ramps @xcite , lane closings , or uphill gradients @xcite , seems not to be of importance .",
    "several types of congested traffic have been found , among them extended states with a relatively high traffic flow .",
    "these states , sometimes referred to as `` synchronized traffic '' @xcite , can be more or less homogeneously flowing , or show distinct oscillations in the time series of detector data @xcite . very often , the congested traffic flow is , apart from fluctuations , homogeneous near the bottleneck , but oscillations occur further upstream @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "one finds isolated stop - and - go waves that propagate in the upstream direction with a characteristic velocity of about 15 km / h @xcite . finally , there is also an observation of a traffic breakdown to a pinned localized cluster near an on - ramp @xcite .",
    "there are several possibilities to delineate traffic mathematically , among them macroscopic models describing the dynamics in terms of aggregate quantities like density or flow @xcite , and microsopic models describing the motion of individual vehicles .",
    "the latter include continuous - in - time models ( car - following models ) @xcite , and cellular automata @xcite .",
    "traffic breakdowns behind bottlenecks have been simulated with the non - local , gaskinetic - based traffic model ( gkt model ) @xcite , the khne - kerner - konhuser - lee model ( kkkl model ) @xcite , and with a new car - following model , which will be reported below .    for a direct comparison with empirical data",
    ", one would prefer car - following models . as the position and velocity of each car is known in such models",
    ", one can reconstruct the way how data are obtained by usual induction - loop detectors . to this end",
    ", one introduces `` virtual '' detectors recording passage times and velocities of crossing vehicles and compares this ouput with the empirical data .",
    "because traffic density is not a primary variable , this avoids the problems associated with determining the traffic density by temporal averages @xcite .",
    "the present study refers to publication @xcite , where , based on a gas - kinetic - based macroscopic simulation model , it has been concluded that there should be five different congested traffic states on freeways with inhomogeneities like on - ramps .",
    "the kind of congested state depends essentially on the inflow into the considered freeway section and on the `` bottleneck strength '' characterizing the inhomogeneity .",
    "this can be summarized by a phase diagram depicting the kind of traffic state as a function of these two parameters .",
    "a similar phase diagram has been obtained for the kkkl model @xcite .",
    "the question is , whether this finding is true for some macroscopic models only , or universal for a larger class of traffic models and confirmed by empirical data .    the relative positions of some of the traffic states in this phase space has been qualitatively confirmed for a korean freeway @xcite , but only one type of extended state has been measured there .",
    "furthermore , this state did not have the characteristic properties of extended congested traffic on most other freeways , cf .",
    "e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is an open question to confirm the relative position of the other states .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge , there are no direct simulations of the different breakdowns using empirical data as boundary conditions , neither with microscopic nor with macroscopic models",
    ".    careful investigations with a new follow - the - leader model ( the idm model ) @xcite show that ( i ) the conclusions of ref @xcite are also valid for certain microscopic traffic models ( at least deterministic models with a metastable density range ) , ( ii ) the results can be systematically transferred to more general ( in particular flow - conserving ) kinds of bottlenecks , and a formula allowing to quantify the bottleneck strength is given [ see eq .",
    "( 15 ) ] , ( iii ) the existence of all predicted traffic states is empirically supported , and finally , ( iv ) all different kinds of breakdowns can be simulated with the idm model with _ empirically measured _ boundary conditions , varying only one parameter ( the average time headway t ) , which is used to specify the capacity of the stretch .",
    "the applied idm model belongs to the class of deterministic follow - the - leader models like the optimal velocity model by bando et al .",
    "@xcite , but it has the following advantages : ( i ) it behaves accident - free because of the dependence on the relative velocity , ( ii ) for similar reasons and because of metastability , it shows the self - organized characteristic traffic constants demanded by kerner et al .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , hysteresis effects @xcite , and complex states @xcite , ( iii )",
    "all model parameters have a reasonable interpretation , are known to be relevant , are empirically measurable , and have the expected order of magnitude @xcite , ( iv ) the fundamental diagram and the stability properties of the model can be easily ( and separately ) calibrated to empirical data , ( v ) it allows for a fast numerical simulation , and ( vi ) an equivalent macroscopic version of the model is known @xcite , which is not the case for most other microscopic traffic models .",
    "these aspects are discussed in sec .",
    "ii , while sec .",
    "iii is not model - specific at all .",
    "section iii presents ways to specify and quantify bottlenecks , as well as the traffic states resulting for different traffic volumes and bottleneck strengths .",
    "the analytical expressions for the phase boundaries of the related phase diagram allow to conclude that similar results will be found for any other traffic model with a stable , metastable , and unstable density range .",
    "even such subtle features like tristability first found in macroscopic models @xcite are observed .",
    "it would be certainly interesting to investigate in the future , whether the same phenomena are also found for ca models or stochastic traffic models like the one by krauss @xcite .",
    "section  iv discusses empirical data using representative examples out of a sample of about 100 investigated breakdowns .",
    "thanks to a new method for presenting the cross section data ( based on a smoothing and interpolation procedure ) , it is possible to present 3d plots of the empirical density or average velocity as a function of time _ and _ space .",
    "this allows a good imagination of the traffic patterns and a direct visual comparison with simulation results . in the idm microsimulations",
    ", we used a very restricted data set , namely only the measured flows and velocities at the upstream and downstream boundaries omitting the data of the up to eight detectors in between . although the simulated sections were up to 13 km long and the boundaries were typically outside of congestions , the simulations reproduced qualitatively the sometimes very complex observed collective dynamics .",
    "all in all the study supports the idea of the suggested phase diagram of congested traffic states quite well and suggests ways to simulate real traffic breakdowns at bottlenecks with empirical boundary conditions .",
    "for about fifty years now , researchers model freeway traffic by means of continuous - in - time microscopic models ( car - following models ) @xcite . since then , a multitude of car - following models have been proposed , both for single - lane and multi - lane traffic including lane changes .",
    "we will restrict , here , to phenomena for which lane changes are not important and only consider single - lane models . to motivate our traffic model we first give an overview of the dynamical properties of some popular microscopic models .",
    "continuous - time single - lane car - following models are defined essentially by their acceleration function . in many of the earlier models",
    "@xcite , the acceleration @xmath0 of vehicle @xmath1 , delayed by a reaction time @xmath2 , can be written as @xmath3 the deceleration @xmath4 is asumed to be proportional to the approaching rate @xmath5 of vehicle @xmath1 with respect to the leading vehicle @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the acceleration may depend on the own velocity @xmath7 @xcite and decrease with some power of the net ( bumper - to - bumper ) distance @xmath8 to the leading vehicle ( where @xmath9 is the vehicle length ) @xcite . since , according to eq .",
    "( [ gazis ] ) , the acceleration depends on a leading vehicle , these models are not applicable for very low traffic densities .",
    "if no leading vehicle is present ( corresponding to @xmath10 ) , the acceleration is either not determined @xmath11 or zero @xmath12 , regardless of the own velocity .",
    "however , one would expect in this case that drivers accelerate to an individual desired velocity .",
    "the car - following behavior in dense traffic is also somewhat unrealistic . in particular",
    ", the gap @xmath13 to the respective front vehicle does not necessarily relax to an equilibrium value .",
    "even small gaps will not induce braking reactions if the velocity difference @xmath14 is zero .",
    "these problems are solved by the car - following model of newell @xcite . in this model",
    ", the velocity at time @xmath15 depends adiabatically on the gap , i.e. , the vehicle adapts exactly to a distance - dependent function @xmath16 within the reaction time @xmath2 , @xmath17 the `` optimal velocity function '' @xmath18\\}$ ] includes both , a desired velocity @xmath19 for vanishing interactions ( @xmath20 ) and a safe time headway @xmath21 characterizing the car - following behavior in dense ( equilibrium ) traffic .",
    "the newell model is collision - free , but the immediate dependence of the velocity on the density leads to very high accelerations of the order of @xmath22 . assuming a typical desired velocity of 30 m / s and @xmath23 s",
    ", this would correspond to 30 m / s@xmath24 , which is clearly unrealistic @xcite .",
    "more than 30 years later , bando _ et al .",
    "_ suggested a similar model , @xmath25 with a somewhat different optimal velocity function .",
    "this `` optimal - velocity mdoel '' has been widely used by physicists because of its simplicity , and because some results could be derived analytically .",
    "the dynamical behavior does not greatly differ from the newell model , since the reaction time delay @xmath2 of the newell model can be compared with the velocity relaxation time @xmath26 of the optimal - velocity model .",
    "however , realistic velocity relaxation times are of the order of 10 s ( city traffic ) to 40 s ( freeway traffic ) and therefore much larger than reaction delay times ( of the order of 1 s ) . for typical values of the other parameters of the optimal - velocity model @xcite",
    ", crashes are only avoided if @xmath27 s , i.e. , the velocity relaxation time is of the order of the reaction time , leading again to unrealistically high values @xmath28 of the maximum acceleration .",
    "the reason of this unstable behavior is that effects of velocity differences are neglected .",
    "however , they play an essential stabilizing role in real traffic , especially when approaching traffic jams . moreover , in models ( [ newell ] ) and ( [ bando ] ) , accelerations and decelerations are symmetric with respect to the deviation of the actual velocity from the equilibrium velocity , which is unrealistic .",
    "the absolute value of braking decelerations is usually stronger than that of accelerations .    a relatively simple model with a generalized optimal velocity function incorporating both",
    ", reactions to velocity differences and different rules for acceleration and braking has been proposed rather recently @xcite .",
    "this `` generalized - force model '' could successfully reproduce the time - dependent gaps and velocities measured by a sensor - equipped car in congested city traffic . however , the acceleration and deceleration times in this model are still unrealistically small which requires inefficiently small time steps for the numerical simulation .    besides these simple models intended for basic investigations , there are also highly complex `` high - fidelity models '' like the wiedemann model @xcite or mitsim @xcite , which try to reproduce traffic as realistically as possible , but at the cost of a large number of parameters .",
    "other approaches that incorporate `` intelligent '' and realistic braking reactions are the simple and fast stochastic models proposed by gipps @xcite and krauss @xcite . despite their simplicity , these models show a realistic driver behavior , have asymmetric accelerations and decelerations , and produce no accidents .",
    "unfortunately , they lose their realistic properties in the deterministic limit .",
    "in particular , they show no traffic instabilities or hysteresis effects for vanishing fluctuations .",
    "the acceleration assumed in the idm is a continuous function of the velocity @xmath7 , the gap @xmath13 , and the velocity difference ( approaching rate ) @xmath14 to the leading vehicle : @xmath29.\\ ] ] this expression is an interpolation of the tendency to accelerate with @xmath30 $ ] on a free road and the tendency to brake with deceleration @xmath31 when vehicle @xmath1 comes too close to the vehicle in front .",
    "the deceleration term depends on the ratio between the `` desired minimum gap '' @xmath32 and the actual gap @xmath33 , where the desired gap @xmath34 is dynamically varying with the velocity and the approaching rate .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will study the case of identical vehicles whose model parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are given in table [ tab : param ] . here , our emphasis is on basic investigations with models as simple as possible , and therefore we will set @xmath41 resulting in a model where all parameters have an intuitive meaning with plausible and often easily measurable values . while the empirical data presented in this paper can be nevertheless reproduced , a distinction of different driver - vehicle types and/or a nonzero @xmath42 @xcite is necessary for a more quantitative agreement .",
    "a nonzero @xmath42 would also be necessary for features requiring an inflection point in the equilibrium flow - density relation , e.g. , for certain types of multi - scale expansions @xcite .",

    "one _ idm parameter to the site - specific driver - vehicle behavior , or to explicitely model the bottleneck by on- and off - ramps .",
    "figure [ flugzeug ] shows an example of a more complex traffic breakdown that occurred on the freeway a8 east from munich to salzburg during the evening rush hour on november 2 , 1998 .",
    "two different kinds of bottlenecks were involved , ( i ) a relatively steep uphill gradient from @xmath239 km to @xmath240 km ( `` irschenberg '' ) , and ( ii ) an incident leading to the closing of one of the three lanes between the cross sections d23 and d24 from @xmath21917:40 h until @xmath21918:10 h. the incident was deduced from the velocity and flow data of the cross sections d23 and d24 as described in section iv b. as further inhomogeneity , there is a small junction at about @xmath241 km .",
    "however , since the involved ramp flows were very small , we assumed that the junction had no dynamical effect .",
    "the oct state caused by the uphill gradient had the same qualitative properties as that on the a9 south .",
    "in particular , the breakdown was triggered by a short flow peak corresponding to a velocity dip in plot [ flugzeug](b ) , the downstream front was stationary , while the upstream front moved , and all oscillations propagated upstream with a constant velocity .",
    "the combined hct / oct state caused by the incident had similar properties as that on the a5 south .",
    "in particular , there was hct near the location of the incident , corresponding to the downstream boundary of the velocity plot [ flugzeug](b ) , while oscillations developped further upstream .",
    "furthermore , similarly to the incident on the a5 , the downstream front propagated upstream as soon as the incident was cleared .",
    "the plot clearly shows , that the hct / oct state propagated seemingly unperturbed through the oct state upstream of the permanent uphill bottleneck . the upstream propagation velocity @xmath230 km / h of _ all _ perturbations in the complex state was remarkably constant , in particular that of ( i ) the upstream and downstream fronts separating the hct / oct state from free traffic ( for @xmath242 km at @xmath23717:40 h and 18:10 h , respectively ) , ( ii ) the fronts separating the hct / oct from the oct state ( 35 km @xmath243 40 km ) , and ( iii ) the oscillations within both the hct and hct / oct states . in contrast , the propagation velocity and direction of the front separating the oct from _",
    "free _ traffic varied with the inflow .",
    "we simulated this scenario using empirical ( lane averaged ) data both for the upstream and downstream boundaries .",
    "for the downstream boundary , we used only the velocity information . specifically , when , at some time @xmath244 , a simulated vehicle @xmath1 crosses the downstream boundary of the simulated section @xmath245 $ ] , we set its velocity to that of the data , @xmath246 , if @xmath247 , and use the velocity and positional information of this vehicle to determine the acceleration of the vehicle @xmath248 behind .",
    "vehicle @xmath1 is taken out of the simulation as soon as vehicle @xmath248 has crossed the boundary .",
    "then , the velocity of vehicle @xmath249 is set to the actual boundary value , and so on .",
    "the downstream boundary conditions are only relevant for the time interval around @xmath250 h where traffic near this boundary is congested . for other time periods ,",
    "the simulation result is equivalent to using homogeneous von - neumann downstream boundary conditions .",
    "we modelled the stationary uphill bottleneck in the usual way by increasing the parameter @xmath21 to a constant value @xmath141 in the downstream region . the incident was already reflected by the downstream boundary conditions .",
    "figure [ flugzeug](c ) shows the simulation result in form of a spatio - temporal plot of the smoothed velocity .",
    "notice that , by using only the boundary conditions and a stationary bottleneck as specific information , we obtained a qualitative agreement of nearly all dynamical collective aspects of the whole complex scenario described above .",
    "in particular , for all times @xmath21517:50 h , there was free traffic at both upstream and downstream detector positions .",
    "therefore , the boundary conditions ( the detector data ) did not contain any explicit information about the breakdown to oct inside the road section , which nevertheless was reproduced correctly as an emergent phenomenon .",
    "finally , we consider a 30 km long section of the a5-north depicted in fig .",
    "[ plcmlcemp](a ) . on this section",
    ", we found one or more traffic breakdowns on six out of 21 days , all of them thursdays or fridays . on three out of 20 days , we observed one or more stop - and - go waves separated by free traffic .",
    "the stop - and go waves were triggered near an intersection and agreed qualitatively with the tsg state of the phase diagram .",
    "on one day , two isolated density clusters propagated through the considered region and did not trigger any secondary clusters , which is consistent with moving localized clusters ( mlc ) and will be discussed below . moving localized clusters",
    "were observed quite frequently on this freeway section @xcite .",
    "again , they have a constant upstream propagation speed of about 15 km / h , and a characteristic outflow @xcite .",
    "in addition , we found four breakdowns to oct , and ten occurrences of pinned localized clusters ( plc ) .",
    "the plc states emerged either at the intersection i1 ( nordwestkreuz frankfurt ) , or 1.5 km downstream of intersection i2 ( bad homburg ) at cross section d13 .",
    "furthermore , the downstream fronts of all four oct states were fixed at the latter location .    on august 6 , 1998 , we found an interesting transition from an oct state whose downsteam front was at d13 , to a tsg state with a downstram front at intersection i2 ( d15 ) .",
    "consequently , we conclude that , around detector d13 , there is a stationary flow - conserving bottleneck with a stronger effect than the intersection itself .",
    "indeed , there is an uphill section and a relatively sharp curve at this location of the a5-north , which may be the reason for the bottleneck .",
    "the sudden change of the active bottleneck on august 6 can be explained by perturbations and the hysteresis associated with breakdowns .",
    "the different types of traffic breakdowns are consistent with the relative locations of the traffic states in the @xmath165 space of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] .",
    "three of the four occurrences of oct and two of the three tsg states were on fridays ( august 14 and august 21 , 1998 ) , on which traffic flows were about 5% _ higher _ than on our reference day ( friday , august 7 , 1998 ) , which will be discussed in detail below .",
    "apart from the coexistent plcs and mlcs observed on the reference day , all plc states occurred on thursdays , where average traffic flows were about 5% _ lower _ than on the reference day .",
    "no traffic breakdowns were observed on saturdays to wednesdays , where the traffic flows were at least 10% lower compared to the reference day . as will be shown below",
    ", for complex bottlenecks like intersections , the coexistence of mlcs and plcs is only possible for flows just above those triggering pure plcs , but below those triggering oct states .",
    "so , we have , with increasing flows , the sequence ft , plc , mlc - plc , and oct or tsg states , in agreement with the theory .",
    "now , we discuss the traffic breakdowns in august 7 , 1998 in detail .",
    "figure [ plcmlcemp](b ) shows the situation from @xmath219 13:20 h until 17:00 h in form of a spatio - temporal plot of the smoothed density . during the whole time interval",
    ", there was a pinned localized cluster at cross section d13 . before @xmath21914:00 h , the plc state showed distinct oscillations ( oplc ) , while it was essentially stationary ( hplc ) afterwards .",
    "furthermore , two moving localized clusters ( mlc ) of unknown origin propagated through nearly the whole displayed section and also through a 10 km long downstream section ( not shown here ) giving a total of at least 30 km .",
    "remarkably , as they crossed the plc at d13 , neither of the congested states seemed to be affected .",
    "this complements the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite , desribing mlc states that propagated unaffected through intersections in the absence of plcs .",
    "as soon as the first mlc state reached the location of the on - ramp of intersection i1 ( @xmath251 km , @xmath237 15:10 h ) , it triggered an additional pinned localized cluster , which dissolved at @xmath237 16:00 h. the second mlc dissolved as soon as it reached the on - ramp of i1 at @xmath252 h.    figure [ plcmlcemp](c ) demonstrates that the mlc and plc states have characteristic signatures also in the empirical flow - density diagram .",
    "as is the case for hct and oct , the plc state is characterized by a two - dimensional flow - density regime ( grey squares ) .",
    "in contrast to the former states , however , there is no flow reduction ( capacity drop ) with respect to free traffic ( black bullets ) .",
    "as is the case for flow - density diagrams of hct compared to oct , it is expected that hplcs are characterized by an isolated region , while the points of oplc lie in a region which is connected to the region for free traffic . during the periods",
    "were the mlcs crossed the plc at d13 , the high traffic flow of the plc state dropped drastically , and the traffic flow had essentially the property of the mlc , see also the velocity plot [ plcmlcemp](e ) .",
    "therefore , we omitted in the plc data the points corresponding to these intervals .    the black bullets for densities @xmath253 vehicles / km indicate the region of the mlc ( or tsg ) states .",
    "due to the aforementioned difficulties in determining the traffic density for very low velocities , the theoretical line @xmath254 given by @xmath255 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "[ plcmlcemp](b ) ) is hard to _ find empirically .",
    "_ in any case , the data suggest that the line @xmath254 would lie below the plc region .    to simulate this scenario it is important that the plc states occurred in or near the freeway intersections . because at both intersections , the off - ramp is upstream of the on - ramp [ fig . [",
    "plcmlcemp](a ) ] , the local flow at these locations is lower . in the following , we will investigate the region around i2 . during the considered time interval , the average traffic flow of both , the on - ramp and the off - ramp was about 300 vehicles per hour and lane . with the exception of the time intervals , during which the two mlcs pass by",
    ", we have about 1200 vehicles per hour and lane at i2 ( d15 ) , and 1500 vehicles per hour and lane upstram ( d16 ) and downstream ( d13 ) of i2 .",
    "this corresponds to an _ increase _ of the effective capacity by @xmath256 vehicles per hour and lane in the region between the off - ramp and the subsequent on - ramp .    in the simulation",
    ", we captured this qualitatively by _ decreasing _ the parameter @xmath21 in a section @xmath257 $ ] upstream of the empirically observed plc state . the hypothetical bottleneck located at d13 , i.e. , about 1 km upstream of the on - ramp , was neglected . using real traffic flows as upstream and downstram boundary conditions and varying only the model parameter @xmath21 within and outside of the intersection",
    ", we could not obtain satisfactory simulation results .",
    "this is probably because of the relatively high and fluctuating traffic flow on this highway .",
    "it remains to be shown if simulations with other model parameters can successfully reproduce the empirical data when applying real boundary conditions .",
    "now , we show that the main _ qualitative _ feature on this highway , namely , the coexistence of pinned and moving localized clusters can , nevertheless , be captured by our model . for this purpose , we assume a constant inflow @xmath258 vehicles per hour and lane to the freeway , with the corresponding equilibrium velocity .",
    "we initialize the plc by a triangular - shaped density peak in the initial conditions , and initialize the mlcs by reducing the velocity at the downstream boundary to @xmath259 km / h during two five - minute intervals ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ plcmlcmic ] ) .",
    "again , we obtained a qualitative agreement with the observed dynamics .",
    "in particular , the simulation showed that also an _ increase _ of the local capacity in a bounded region can lead to pinned localized clusters .",
    "furthermore , the regions of the mlc and plc states in the flow - density diagram were reproduced qualitatively , in particular , the coexistence of pinned and moving localized clusters .",
    "we did not observe such a coexistence in the simpler system underlying the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , which did not include a second low - capacity stretch upstream of the high - capacity stretch .    to explain the coexistence of plc and mlc in the more complex system consisting of one high - capacity stretch in the middle of two low - capacity stretches , it is useful to interpret the inhomogeneity not in terms of a local capacity _ increase _ in the region @xmath257 $ ] , but as a capacity _ decrease _ for @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "( for simplicity , we will not explicitely include the 400 m long transition regions of capacity increase at @xmath262 and decrease at @xmath263 in the following discussion . )",
    "then , the location @xmath264 can be considered as the beginning of a bottleneck , as in the system underlying the phase diagram .",
    "if the width @xmath265 of the region with locally increased capacity is _ larger than the width of plcs _ , such clusters are possible under the same conditions as in the standard phase diagram .",
    "in particular , traffic in the standard system is stable in regions upstream of a plc , which is the reason why any additional mlc , triggered somewhere in the downstream region @xmath261 and propagating upstream , will vanish as soon as it crosses the plc at @xmath264 .",
    "however , this disappearance is not instantaneous , but the mlc will continue to propagate upstream for an additional flow - dependent `` dissipation distance '' or `` penetration depths '' . if the width @xmath265 is _ smaller than the dissipation distance for mlcs _ , crossing mlcs will not fully disappear before they reach the upstream region @xmath260 .",
    "there , traffic is metastable again , so that the mlcs can persist . since , in the metastable regime , the outflow of mlcs is equal to their inflow ( in this regime , mlcs are equivalent to `` narrow '' clusters , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the passage of the mlc does not change the traffic flow at the position of the plc , which can , therefore , persist as well .",
    "we performed several simulations varying the inflow within the range where plcs are possible . for smaller inflows ,",
    "the dissipation distance became smaller than @xmath265 , and the moving localized cluster was absorbed within the inhomogeneity .",
    "an example for this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ plcmlcemp](b ) at @xmath237 16:40 h and @xmath266 489 km .",
    "larger inflows lead to an extended oct state upstream of the capacity - increasing defect , which is also in accordance with the observations .",
    "in this paper , we investigated , to what extent the phase diagram fig , [ phasediag ] can serve as a general description of collective traffic dynamics in open , inhomogeneous systems .",
    "the original phase diagram was formulated for on - ramps and resulted from simulations with macroscopic models @xcite . by simulations with a new car - following model we showed that one can obtain the same phase diagram from microsimulations .",
    "this includes even such subtle details as the small region of tristability .",
    "the proposed intelligent - driver model ( idm ) is simple , has only a few intuitive parameters with realistic values , reproduces a realistic collective dynamics , and also leads to a plausible `` microscopic '' acceleration and deceleration behaviour of single drivers .",
    "an interesting open question is whether the phase diagram can be reproduced also with cellular automata .",
    "we generalized the phase diagram from on - ramps to other kinds of inhomogeneities .",
    "microsimulations of a flow - conserving bottleneck realized by a locally increased safe time headway suggest that , with respect to collective effects outside of the immediate neighbourhood of the inhomogeneity , all types of bottlenecks can be characterized by a single parameter , the bottleneck strength .",
    "this means , that the type of traffic breakdown depends essentially on the two control parameters of the phase diagram only , namely the traffic flow , and the bottleneck strength .",
    "however , in some multistable regions , the history ( i.e. , the previous traffic dynamics ) matters as well .",
    "we checked this also by macroscopic simulations with the same type of flow - conserving inhomogeneity and with microsimulations using a locally decreased desired velocity as bottleneck @xcite . in all cases",
    ", we obtained qualitatively the same phase diagram .",
    "what remains to be done is to confirm the phase diagram also for microsimulations of on - ramps .",
    "these can be implemented either by explicit multi - lane car - following models @xcite , or , in the framework of single - lane models , by placing additional vehicles in suitable gaps between vehicles in the `` ramp '' region .    by presenting empirical data of congested traffic",
    ", we showed that all congested states proposed by the phase diagram were observed in reality , among them localized and extended states which can be stationary as well as oscillatory , furthermore , moving or pinned localized clusters ( mlcs or plcs , respectively ) .",
    "the data suggest that the typical kind of traffic congestion depends on the specific freeway .",
    "this is in accordance with other observations , for example , moving localized clusters on the a5 north @xcite , or homogeneous congested traffic ( hct ) on the a5-south @xcite .",
    "in contrast to another empirical study @xcite , the frequent oscillating states ( oct ) in our empirical data did not show mergings of density clusters , although these can be reproduced with our model with other parameter values @xcite .",
    "the relative positions of the various observed congested states in the phase diagram were consistent with the theoretical predictions .",
    "in particular , when increasing the _ traffic flow _ on the freeway , the phase diagram predicts ( hysteretic ) transitions from free traffic to plcs , and then to extended congested states . by ordering the various forms of congestion on the a5-north with respect to the average traffic flow , the observations agree with these predictions",
    "moreover , given an extended congested state and increasing the _ bottleneck strength _",
    ", the phase diagram predicts ( non - hysteretic ) transitions from triggered stop - and - go waves ( tsg ) to oct , and then to hct . to show the qualitative agreement with the data",
    ", we had to estimate the bottleneck strength @xmath147 .",
    "this was done directly by identifying the bottleneck strength with ramp flows , e.g. , on the a5-north , or indirectly , by comparing the outflows from congested traffic with and without a bottleneck , e.g. , for the incident on the a5-south . with oct and tsg on the a5-north , but hct on the a5-south , where the bottleneck strength was much higher",
    ", we obtained again the right behavior .",
    "however , one needs a larger base of data to determine an empirical phase diagram , in particular with its boundaries between the different traffic states .",
    "such a phase diagram has been proposed for a japanese highway @xcite . besides plc states , many breakdowns on this freeway lead to extended congestions with fixed downstream _ and _ upstream fronts .",
    "we did not observe such states on german freeways and believe that the fixed upstream fronts were the result of a further inhomogeneity , but this remains to be investigated .",
    "our traffic data indicate that the majority of traffic breakdowns is triggered by some kind of _ stationary _ inhomogeneity , so that the phase diagram is applicable .",
    "such inhomogeneities can be of a very general nature .",
    "they include not only ramps , gradients , lane narrowings or -closings , but also incidents in the _ oppositely _ flowing traffic . in the latter case , the bottleneck is constituted by a temporary loss of concentration and by braking maneuvers of curious drivers _ at a fixed location_. from the more than 100 breakdowns on various german and dutch freeways investigated by us , there were only four cases ( among them the two moving localized clusters in fig .",
    "[ plcmlcemp ] ) , where we could not explain the breakdowns by some sort of stationary bottleneck within the road sections for which data were available to us .",
    "possible explanations for the breakdowns in the four remaining cases are not only spontaneous breakdowns @xcite , but also breakdowns triggered by a",
    "_ nonstationary _ perturbation , e.g. , moving `` phantom bottlenecks '' caused by two trucks overtaking each other @xcite , or inhomogeneities outside the considered sections .",
    "our simulations showed that stationary downstream fronts are a signature of non - moving bottlenecks .",
    "finally , we could qualitatively reproduce the collective dynamics of several rather complex traffic breakdowns by microsimulations with the idm , using empirical data for the boundary conditions .",
    "we varied only a _",
    "model parameter , the safe time headway , to adapt the model to the individual capacities of the different roads , _ and _ to implement the bottlenecks .",
    "we also performed separate macrosimulations with the gkt model and could reproduce the observations as well . because both models are effective - single lane models , this suggests that lane changes are not relevant to reproduce the collective dynamics causing the different types of congested traffic .",
    "furthermore , we assumed identical vehicles and therefore conclude that also the heterogeneity of real traffic is not necessary for the basic mechanism of traffic instability .",
    "we expect , however , that other yet unexplained aspects of congested traffic require a microscopic treatment of both , multi - lane traffic and heterogeneous traffic .",
