    "the rate of nuclear reactions plays an important role in many fields of astrophysics .",
    "it sets the time scale for various processes , such as energy release in the core of stars .",
    "it is also a crucial factor to determine the fate of accreting white dwarfs in binary systems ( see e.g. isern & hernanz 1994 ) . in dense matter ,",
    "the surrounding ions screen the coulomb barrier between the two reacting nuclei and thus increase the reaction rate compared to the infinitely dilute plasma , as shown originally by schatzman ( 1948 ) .",
    "one usually assumes that the electrons can be treated as a uniform , _ rigid _ background , the so - called one - component - plasma ( ocp ) or binary ionic mixture ( bim ) model .",
    "this approximation has been studied extensively by many authors and for recent discussions see e.g. yakovlev & shalybkov ( 1989 ) , sahrling ( 1994b ) . in general , electron polarization effects are small since the thomas - fermi screening length is larger than the mean distance between the ions .",
    "moreover people have generally concentrated on the so - called classical or zeroth order contribution to the reaction rate ( see for example , mochkovitch & hernanz 1986 , ichimaru & utsumi 1983 , yakovlev & shalybkov 1989 , ichimaru and ogata 1991 , sahrling 1994 b ) , although the quantum mechanical , or higher order , contributions are discussed to some extent in these papers .",
    "sahrling ( 1994b ) found that the quantum corrections give a much smaller contribution to the reaction rate than suggested by some previous calculations .",
    "he also proposed that the electrons would reduce the reaction rate and this could affect the late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "the investigation was based on a mean ( or screening- ) potential that was calculated for only one choice of density , temperature and charge for the ionic plasma . in this paper , we examine in details the effect of electron gas polarization in the high - density regime corresponding to degenerate , relativistic electrons .",
    "we extend the previous calculations to a wider range of densities , charges and temperatures and we calculate the quantum correction to the classical enhancement factor . in sect .",
    "2 we describe how the polarization of the electron gas is taken into account and we derive analytical formulae for the corresponding correction to the reaction rate .",
    "the astrophysical consequences are described in sect .",
    "3 followed by the conclusion in sect .",
    "this section is divided into three subsections . in sect .",
    "2.1 , we briefly review the theory of reaction rates in dense matter and we describe the calculations of the correction arising from the electron gas polarization .",
    "we concentrate on densities and temperatures where the electrons are degenerate and relativistic , since , as we argue below , we expect quantum effects to be most significant in that region .",
    "section 2.2 describes the calculations of the mean potential and analytical fitting formulae for these potentials are given at the end of the subsection .",
    "the enhancement factors due to a polarized electron gas are calculated in sect .",
    "2.3 and analytical fitting formulae are also provided for these factors .      when investigating non - resonant reaction rates in dense matter one usually discusses enhancement factors , where one normalises the reaction rate in the correlated plasma to its value in an infinitely dilute gas .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that the matrix element describing the actual nuclear reaction , which is considered to be independent of the neighbour ions and electrons , is cancelled out and one is left with a simpler expression ( see e.g. alastuey & jancovici 1978 ) .",
    "for a recent discussion of some of the basic approximations and assumptions see sahrling ( 1994a , b ) .",
    "one assumes usually that the electrons are uniformly and homogeneously distributed in the plasma , the so - called rigid background approximation .",
    "this yields the well - studied ocp model ( or bim for a binary mixture ) to describe the thermodynamic properties of dense matter . in this paper",
    ", we examine the case where such an approximation is no longer valid and where the _ inhomogeneous _ electron gas is polarized by the external field due to the surrounding nuclei .",
    "the plasma is described by @xmath0 ions of mass @xmath1 and charge @xmath2 moving in a volume @xmath3 .",
    "the density @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 are such that that the electrons are degenerate and completely stripped off the atoms , so that the electroneutrality condition yields @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of free electrons .",
    "we restrict the present study to the region below the neutronisation threshold .",
    "for ions such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 all these conditions correspond to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the physical state of the one - component - plasma is described universally by two parameters .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath12 is simply the ratio of the mean coulomb energy to the average kinetic energy of the ions , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the wigner - seitz radius @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "above @xmath17 , the crystal becomes stable and the matter is solid ( dubin , 1990 ) .",
    "since we consider presently reaction rates in the fluid phase , we require @xmath18 .",
    "relativistic effects on the electrons velocity are measured by the parameter @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fermi - momentum of the electrons and @xmath21 denotes their mass .",
    "to measure quantum effects we use the parameter @xmath22 , which is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the classical turning point at the gamow peak incident energy for the infinitely dilute plasma .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 corresponds to the more widely used combination @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the penetration probability of the coulomb barrier for the infinitely dilute plasma .",
    "quantum effects become increasingly important as @xmath22 gets larger , i.e. for small temperatures and high densities . in this paper",
    "we will examine densities of the carbon / oxygen plasma where the electrons are highly relativistic ( @xmath27 ) , as commonly encountered in the core of massive white dwarfs .",
    "however , in order to avoid exchange effects between the _ ions _ , we will restrict the calculations to the region in the ( @xmath28)-plane where the ionic thermal de broglie wavelength is smaller than the mean inter - ionic distance , i.e. @xmath29 . in terms of @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath22 this condition can be written , using @xmath30 , @xmath31 for carbon and oxygen ions under white dwarf central density conditions , @xmath32 when @xmath33 so the condition ( 4 ) is valid below the line of solidification , i.e. in the entire fluid phase .",
    "the lowest order correction to the final reaction rate at this limit , in @xmath34 , is about 50% ( sahrling 1994b ) .",
    "the effective interionic potential @xmath35 , which takes into account polarization effects of the electron gas , is given by @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the wavenumber ( hubbard & slattery 1971 ; galam & hansen 1976 ; yakovlev & shalybkov 1989 ; chabrier 1990 ) .",
    "for @xmath38 we use the static dielectric function of relativistic degenerate electrons ( jancovici 1962 ) .",
    "we exclude the vacuum polarization part of @xmath39 since that will not affect the rate by more than a few percent ( gould 1990 ) .",
    "let us now assume that two particles are moving towards each other .",
    "the probability of a nuclear reaction between them is given by the pair distribution function @xmath40 where @xmath41 is of nuclear dimensions . since in coulombic matter",
    "@xmath41 is much smaller than @xmath15 one can evaluate the pair distribution at @xmath42 ( alastuey & jancovici 1978 ) .",
    "if the nuclear reaction itself is independent of the neighbour ions one can normalise the rate to the infinitely dilute plasma .",
    "the enhancement factor @xmath43 is then given by    @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 is the pair distribution function with @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the distance between the reacting particles .",
    "the potential felt by the reacting pair from the neighbour ions is approximated by a mean potential @xmath50 , defined by : @xmath51 { \\diff\\alpha \\diff{\\vec r}\\over v^{n-1}}\\;. \\eqno(9)\\ ] ] where @xmath52 denotes the coordinates of all neighbour ions in the volume @xmath3 and @xmath53 is the center - of - mass coordinate of the reacting pair .",
    "@xmath54 denotes the sum of all pair interactions except the one between the reacting pair .",
    "@xmath55 is the helmholtz free energy of the system .",
    "the accuracy of the mean - potential approach has been explored in details by jancovici ( 1977 ) , alastuey & jancovici ( 1978 ) , jndel & sahrling ( 1992 ) and sahrling ( 1994a ) . the right - hand - side of eqn .",

    "( 10 ) is the same as @xmath59 but for the bare coulomb potential @xmath60 and @xmath48 .",
    "the first term in the integrand of @xmath59 in ( 11 ) is the penetration probability through the combined potential @xmath61 and the second term is simply the thermal weight . for details of the derivation , see alastuey & jancovici ( 1978 ) and sahrling ( 1994a , b ) .",
    "we have calculated the mean potential in eq .",
    "( 9 ) for various combinations of the density and temperature for carbon and oxygen ions .",
    "we employ the monte carlo so - called  minimum - image convention \" ( brush , sahlin & teller 1966 ) . according to this scheme",
    ", a particle in the basic box is allowed to interact only with each of the @xmath62 other particles in the basic box or with the nearest  image \" of this particle in one of the neighbouring cells . in other words ,",
    "each particle interacts with the @xmath62 particles that happen to be located in a cube centered at the particle at any time .",
    "this method is not useful for long - range interactions , such as the bare coulomb interaction . in our case",
    "the _ screened _ effective potential is of yukawa - type , i.e. of short - range type .",
    "we found that we needed at least 2000 particles in the basic monte carlo box in order to avoid border effects for @xmath63 .",
    "in general we require the accuracy in @xmath64 to be better than @xmath65 .",
    "this leads to an uncertainty in @xmath66 less than 20 % . in fig .",
    "1 we show the result for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is too time - consuming to use eq .",
    "( 5 ) explicitly to calculate the interaction between each pair of particles in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "we therefore calculate @xmath35 at 10000 points between @xmath70 $ ] and use the result as an input vector to the monte carlo code where we interpolate the vector linearly .",
    "the accuracy in @xmath64 of this procedure was found to be better than @xmath65 by comparing with runs using 20000 points .",
    "for each combination of density , temperature and charge we used @xmath71 configurations where we started from a random configuration .",
    "we ignored the initial @xmath72 configurations because they have not reached equilibrium .",
    "we also made sure that this number of configurations was adequate by comparing with runs using @xmath73 configurations .",
    "the code we use is based on a code kindly supplied by w.l .",
    "slattery for the ocp ( slattery et al . 1980 ) .",
    "the variation of the mean potential ( 9 ) with @xmath74 is smaller than 10 % for @xmath75 .",
    "there is , however , a strong dependence on @xmath76 which is consistent with the analysis of yakovlev & shalybkov ( 1989 ) .",
    "we have constructed the following fitting formula for the screening potential : @xmath77 where the constants @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are given in table 1 .",
    "the absolute error in the fit is less than @xmath81 above @xmath82 .",
    "below @xmath82 the error is in principle not kown .",
    "yakovlev and shalybkov ( 1989 ) calculated the value of the classical contribution from polarized electrons @xmath83 , using the so - called linear mixing law , whose accuracy has been demonstrated recently ( rosenfeld 1994 , 1996 ; dewitt , slattery & chabrier 1996 ) .",
    "however , yakovlev and shalybkov s calculations are based on an expansion scheme of the free energy due to the electron polarization with respect to the reference rigid background energy , thus reducing the validity of the calculations to the weak screening ( small @xmath74 or @xmath84 ) regime .",
    "chabrier ( 1998 ) extended these calculations to regimes of stronger screening by calculating explicitely the electron contribution from eqn(5 ) .",
    "the equations were solved within the framework of the so - called hyper - netted chain ( hnc ) theory of the n - body problem .",
    "the hnc results are found to agree remarkably well ( @xmath85 ) with the monte - carlo results ( see e.g. chabrier 1990 ; dewitt , slattery & chabrier 1996 ) .",
    "given the rapidity of the hnc calculations compared to lengthy numerical mc - simulations , we were able to explore a wide density- and temperature - range corresponding to different values of the relativistic parameter .",
    "we used these calculations of @xmath83 and the small-@xmath86 behaviour of @xmath35 to calculate @xmath87 .",
    "the constants @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are found by extrapolating the monte carlo results in a way similar to rosenfeld ( 1992 ) and sahrling ( 1994b ) .",
    "the expressions for these constants are quite complicated and will not be given explicitly .",
    "we have calculated the enhancement factors due to the electron gas polarization .",
    "the correction with respect to the rigid - background calculations , for the one - component case , is given by : @xmath91    where @xmath83 denotes the classical contribution from the polarized electrons and the second term is the quantum correction .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( 10 ) to calculate @xmath43 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for the rigid background ( ocp )",
    "result we use a similar expression but with the potentials derived in rosenfeld ( 1992 ; 1994 ) .",
    "for @xmath94 the results calculated at @xmath68 can be parametrized by :    @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98    as mentioned above , the @xmath74-dependence of the screening potential , and thus of @xmath99 is weak over the density - range of interest .",
    "we found that these expressions for @xmath94 are valid in the regime @xmath100 , @xmath101 with an absolute rms - error less than 0.05 .",
    "the functions @xmath102 have been calculated using a root - mean - square fit to 30 points in the interval @xmath103 .",
    "there is actually a weak dependence on @xmath12 in @xmath104 but @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) has been averaged to give a total error in @xmath105 @xmath106 for the density- and temperature - range explored presently . in table 2",
    "we compare these new results for the contribution arising from polarized electrons with the ones obtained in sahrling ( 1994b ) . within the accuracy of the present formulae , the electrons will essentially _ increase _ the reaction rate .",
    "it is clear from the table that the extrapolation error made in sahrling ( 1994b ) is most severe for the charge @xmath76 but also that a careful analysis of different densities and temperatures is important .",
    "it is noteworthy that quantum effects ( high @xmath22 ) act to reduce the enhanced reaction rate caused by the lowering of the coulomb barrier , as given by @xmath94 . for high values of @xmath22 and @xmath12",
    ", quantum effects can be very important for @xmath107 . in all cases ,",
    "the contribution of the electrons to the enhancement factors of nuclear reactions in dense stellar plasmas remains of the order of the unity , at most a factor @xmath108 if quantum corrections are not included .",
    "this is much smaller than the classical _ ionic _ contribution @xmath109 under similar thermodynamic conditions .",
    "confusion had been brought by ichimaru and collaborators ( ichimaru & utsumi 1983 ; ichimaru & ogata 1991 ) who obtained electron enhancement factors of several orders of magnitude .",
    "these results are based on erroneous calculations which involve the difference between two very large numbers ( eqns ( 17 ) and ( 9 ) of the afore - mentioned references , respectively ) , whereas a direct resolution of eqn .",
    "( 10 ) with the potential ( 5 ) can be done easily , as in the present calculations .",
    "in the late stages of stellar evolution for intermediate - mass stars , the core consists of a mixture of carbon and oxygen ions , and degenerate electrons . as density and temperature increase , they will reach eventually thermodynamic conditions where the energy release from the nuclear reactions equals locally the neutrino energy loss .",
    "the points in the @xmath110 plane where this occurs define the carbon ignition curve .",
    "this is of prime importance in particular for accreting white dwarfs , for it determines the fate of the object .",
    "small changes in the enhancement factors of nuclear reactions can make a spectacular difference in the outcome , the star becoming either a type - i supernova or collapsing into a neutron star ( isern & hernanz 1994 ) .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of accurate calculations for these factors . with the enhancement factor @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( 13 ) , the generalisation to mixtures according to rosenfeld ( 1992 ; 1994 ) , the perfect gas reaction rates of caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) and the neutrino rates calculated by itoh et al .",
    "( 1989 ; 1992 ) , one gets the curves shown in fig . 2 for different oxygen abundances .",
    "note that although the expressions for the electron screening differ by up to a factor 2 with respect to the results of sahrling ( 1994b ) , the corresponding change in the carbon ignition curve is only about 10 % at a given temperature around @xmath112 .",
    "note also that the effect of the electron screening on the carbon ignition curve remains small , as expected from the value of @xmath113 close to unity , contrarily to what has been claimed by ichimaru & ogata ( 1991 ) .",
    "these latter calculations were based on the afore - mentioned erroneous electron enhancement factors . as shown on figure 2 , the full and dotted lines ( pure carbon with and without polarization , respectively )",
    "are nearly superimposed . as shown by chabrier ( 1993 )",
    ", quantum effects in the structure of the ionic stellar plasma might also affect the plasma melting curve , and thus the wd cooling and the ignition curve .",
    "work in this direction is under progress .",
    "we have calculated enhancement factors for non - resonant nuclear reaction rates due to polarized electrons over a wide range of temperatures and densities characteristic of dense stellar plasmas .",
    "the calculations have been conducted for large values of the electron relativistic parameter and thus are not restricted to weak screening .",
    "the analysis is based on a new set of mean ( or screening- ) potentials calculated using standard monte carlo techniques and n - body theory calculations .",
    "we have focussed on carbon and oxygen ions since one expects high - order quantum effects to be most important for these nuclei .",
    "the calculations can be easily applied to similar mixtures as oxygen - neon - magnesium for example .",
    "we find that quantum high - order corrections to the classical enhancement factor will be important for low temperatures and high densities and will _ reduce _ the zeroth order ( classical ) contribution . in an earlier work we discussed the possibility that polarized electrons would reduce the nuclear reaction .",
    "this work was based on a mean potential calculated for carbon only and just one density and temperature , so the extrapolation error was expected to be large .",
    "the present work has removed this extrapolation error and we have shown that polarized electrons yield a small ( @xmath114 ) enhancement of the nuclear reaction rate , contrarily to what had been claimed in previous studies .",
    "these results have been used to derive more accurate carbon ignition curves for the ultimate stages of intermediate - mass stars and accreting white dwarfs .",
