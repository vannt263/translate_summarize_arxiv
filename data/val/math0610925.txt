    "we do not consider the critical horizontal ( vertical ) grid line of @xmath90 because that line may now have some more crossings due to expansion of both the edges .    an interesting question is whether faultfree tilings can have crossing number 1 .",

    "the first term is due to convolution ; since @xmath218 considers extensions on both left and right sides , we divide the square of the one - sided generating function @xmath219 by @xmath220 .",
    "also , the base rectangle @xmath184 is considered twice , once by each @xmath213 term .",
    "so we merge the two rectangles into one , decreasing the number of columns by six and the number of tilings of the initial @xmath184 by @xmath216 .",
    "therefore we divide @xmath221 by @xmath222 .",
    "note that the first term in @xmath213 is a multiple of @xmath223 .",

    "either @xmath224 or @xmath225 , we add @xmath213 to this convolution .",
    "once we have @xmath213 , and we can use theorem 7 to determine @xmath218 . we demonstrate the usefulness of the above theorem for the case of tiling @xmath191 , where @xmath30 , faultfreely . here",

    "so , all tilings produced by extending figure 10(b ) are distinct from those produced by extending figure 10(a ) .    the generating function @xmath314 ,",
    "where the coefficient of @xmath301 , where @xmath30 , is the total number of ways of tiling @xmath231 faultfreely , when @xmath233 ( as shown in figure 10(b ) ) is extended only on one side ( either entirely to the left , or entirely to the right ) is ,    @xmath315    so , the generating function @xmath218 , where the coefficient of @xmath301 , where @xmath30 , is the total number of ways of tiling @xmath231 faultfreely , when @xmath233 is extended either only on one side ( either entirely to the left , or entirely to the right ) or on both sides is ,    @xmath316    here , @xmath317 and @xmath318 have been calculated in accordance with theorem 7 .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the number of domino tilings of a given rectangle @xmath52 is more or less than the number of tromino tilings of @xmath52 .",
    "intuitively , one might say that we have more freedom in tiling a rectangle with dominoes than with trominoes , by this we mean that there are possibly more ways of retiling a given area with dominoes than with trominoes .",
    "however , no such comparisons have been reported so far in the literature .",
    "we now present such a comparison , thereby producing an upper bound on the number of tromino tilings of a given rectangle @xmath52 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in order to develop such a comparison",
    ", we first define a _ monodic _",
    "tiling of @xmath52 as a tiling with @xmath98 dominoes and @xmath98 monominoes .",
    "we now construct a one - to - one mapping function from the set of tromino tilings of a rectangle @xmath52 to the set of monodic tilings of @xmath52 . our mapping function is diagramatically explained in figure 17 .",
    "we call a domino with an arrow ( as shown in figure 17 ) a _ directed _ domino .",
    "we call a monodic tiling with directed dominoes as a _ directed monodic tiling_. the conversion from a tromino tiling of @xmath52 to a directed monodic tiling of @xmath52 is clear from the mapping function ( by converting every tromino to a combination of a directed domino and a monomino as shown in figures 17(a)-(d ) )",
    ". we call a directed monodic tiling of @xmath52 as _ valid _ if it was obtained from a tromino tiling of @xmath52 via the mapping function depicted in figure 17 . for the reverse , converting a valid directed monodic tiling of @xmath52 to a tromino tiling of @xmath52 , we simply attach every monomino to the right of the arrow of a directed domino , in a valid directed monodic tiling of @xmath52 , to form a tromino ; thereby constructing a tromino tiling of @xmath52 . the proof that this mapping is one - to - one is easy and",
    "is left to the reader as an exercise .    as depicted in figure 17(1 ) , a tromino tiling of @xmath52 , after being converted to the corresponding directed monodic tiling , decided by the mapping function in figure 17(1 ) ( a)-(d ) , can be _ stretched _ either horizontally or vertically to a domino tiling . by _ stretching _ we double either the length @xmath8 or the breadth @xmath15 of the rectangle @xmath52 . in this process , every monomino gets converted to a domino , and a domino gets converted into either two horizontal dominoes lying side - by - side ( in case of a horizontal stretching of @xmath52 ) , or it gets converted to two horizontal dominoes one lying on top of the other ( in case of a vertical stretching of @xmath52 ) .",
    "this conversion is shown in figures 17(1 ) ( i)-(j ) .",
    "so a tromino tiling of @xmath48 ( as shown in figure 17(1)(e ) ) gets converted to a domino tiling of either @xmath319 or @xmath320 ( as shown in figures 17(1)(g ) and ( h ) ) .",
    "the reader must note that not every domino tiling of @xmath321 is obtained by stretching a monodic tiling of @xmath52 .",
    "note , for example , the domino tiling of @xmath322 shown in figure 17(2 ) .",
    "the reader can verify that this domino tiling can not be obtained by stretching ( either horizontally or vertically ) any monodic tiling of @xmath66 .    by our mapping function ,",
    "every tromino tiling of @xmath52 gets coverted to a unique directed monodic tiling .",
    "if we mutiply the total number of monodic tilings of @xmath52 by @xmath323 , we get the total number of directed monodic tilings of @xmath52 .",
    "first , let us focus only on the case when the stretching done is horizontal . with slight modification",
    ", our streching process can also be converted to a one - to - one mapping function which converts every monodic tiling of @xmath52 to a domino tiling of @xmath321 .",
    "we call a domino tiling of @xmath321 _ valid _ if it was obtained by stretching a monodic tiling of @xmath52",
    ". any valid domino tiling can be converted back to a monodic tiling of @xmath52 simply by _ unstretching _",
    "( i.e. , compressing lengthwise ) the valid domino tiling of @xmath321 .",
    "suppose we have a monodic tiling of @xmath52 .",
    "colour _ this tiling in the following manner , every monomino is coloured _ blue _ and every domino is coloured _",
    "red_. we now stretch @xmath52 length - wise to produce @xmath321 .",
    "the outcome will be a _ coloured _ domino tiling of @xmath321 .",
    "note that the dominoe(s ) produced by the stretching of a coloured monomino ( domino ) will be of the same colour as that of the monomino ( domino ) . and",
    "similarly , we define the unstretching of a coloured domino tiling .",
    "we have the following lemma .",
    "distinct coloured monodic tilings of @xmath52 give rise to distinct coloured domino tilings of @xmath321 .",
    "we prove the above claim by the method of contradiction .",
    "let us assume on the contrary that the above claim is false .",
    "first suppose that two distinct coloured monodic tilings of @xmath52 give rise to the same coloured domino tiling of @xmath321 via stretching .",
    "since the two monodic tilings of @xmath52 being considered are distinct , we know that the position of at least one monomino is different in these two tilings .",
    "this means that the position of a monomino in the first tiling of @xmath52 is covered by a domino in the second tiling of @xmath52 .",
    "let this monomino be @xmath44 .",
    "it can be easily seen that after stretching of @xmath52 , the squares @xmath324 and @xmath325 correspond to the square @xmath44 in @xmath52 .",
    "these two squares in @xmath321 will be covered by a blue domino via the first monodic tiling and a red domino via the second .",
    "but this is impossible because both the coloured monodic tilings of @xmath52 being considered give rise to the same coloured domino tiling of @xmath321 .",
    "thus , we arrive at a contradiction .",
    "now suppose that two distinct coloured domino tilings of @xmath321 give rise to the same coloured monodic tiling of @xmath52 after unstretching .",
    "again , since the two coloured domino tilings are distinct , the position of at least one square @xmath44 ( say ) in one domino tiling is covered by a red ( blue ) domino and which is covered by a blue ( red ) domino in the other .",
    "the reader can see that after unstretching the rectangle @xmath321 , each square @xmath44 in @xmath321 maps to @xmath326)$ ] in @xmath52 ( here [ x ] represents the integer part of x ) .",
    "when we unstretch the two coloured tilings , this means that the square @xmath326)$ ] in @xmath52 , corresponding to the square @xmath44 in @xmath321 , will be red ( blue ) via the first tiling and blue ( red ) via the second tiling .",
    "thus , we again arrive at a contradiction .",
    "so , we conclude that distinct coloured monodic tilings of @xmath52 map to distinct coloured domino tilings of @xmath321 .",
    "we have already shown that not all domino tilings of @xmath321 are valid .",
    "thus , via the two mappings just described above , we have defined an injective function from the set of tromino tilings of @xmath52 to a proper subset of coloured domino tilings of @xmath321 .",
    "the number of coloured domino tilings of @xmath321 is simply @xmath327 times the number of domino tilings of @xmath321 ( since every domino can be coloured either red or blue ) . since the direction of stretching is unimportant in the proofs above , the reader should convince himself that the above claims also hold for vertical stretching of rectangles .",
    "let @xmath328 @xmath329 , denote the number of tromino ( domino ) tilings of @xmath52 .",
    "we summarize our result in the following theorem .    for all rectangles @xmath52 , such that @xmath6 and @xmath7",
