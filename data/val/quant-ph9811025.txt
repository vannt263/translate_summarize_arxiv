    "most semiclassical approaches to the dirac equation so far aimed at an extension of the wkb method , with the expectation that some kind of bohr - sommerfeld quantisation conditions would emerge in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the earliest such approach is due to pauli @xcite , who succeeded in showing that the phase of a wkb spinor is given by a solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation for relativistic point particles .",
    "but he could determine the amplitude of the semiclassical spinor only in some special cases .",
    "although the programme mentioned above has been very successful in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , where it leads to the so - called einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) quantisation @xcite , establishing semiclassical quantisation conditions in the case of the dirac equation was found to be obstructed by the occurence of certain phases .",
    "investigating multicomponent wave equations yabana and horiuchi @xcite noticed that geometric phases play an important rle in this context and have to be incorporated in appropriate quantisation conditions . using path integrals instead of the wkb method , kuratsuji and",
    "iida @xcite realised that an inclusion of the geometric phases in the symplectic form on classical phase space offers a possibility to arrive at quantisation conditions .",
    "a general theory of semiclassical quantisation for multicomponent wave equations in arbitrary dimensions , which derive from classical hamiltonian matrices with no globally degenerate eigenvalues , was developed by littlejohn and flynn @xcite .",
    "this method , however , does not apply to the dirac hamiltonian since the eigenvalues of the associated classical hamiltonian matrix are twofold degenerate .",
    "indeed , emmrich and weinstein @xcite found that in the degenerate case integrability of the corresponding classical dynamics is not a sufficiently strong condition to allow for an extension of ebk quantisation to the case of multicomponent wave equations .",
    "moreover , even if successful , the procedure described above would not apply to systems whose classical limit is nonintegrable . in this paper",
    "we will therefore follow an alternative approach in that we investigate the semiclassical time evolution and then derive a semiclassical trace formula .",
    "this method is in the spirit of gutzwiller s semiclassical treatment of the schrdinger equation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the quantum mechanical density of states is set into relation to a sum over the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system .",
    "the geometric phases mentioned above also appear in our approach in that they represent the spin transport along classical orbits in the trace formula .",
    "the advantage of a trace formula approach is not only that it is applicable to both integrable and chaotic systems , but that it also provides the basis for efficient semiclassical quantisation conditions . in the context of quantum chaos extensive studies in this direction",
    "have been undertaken , see e.  g.  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , semiclassical trace formulae are the primary tools for a semiclassical theory of spectral statistics , see e.  g.   @xcite .",
    "before we go into more detail we want to take the opportunity to clarify our point of view regarding the semiclassical limit on which we base the following investigations . in general we will consider the mathematical limit @xmath0 , with the understanding that in a given physical situation an equivalent limit in terms of physical quantities such as controlable external parameters has to be taken .",
    "the effect of such a limit can then be expressed in terms of the spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian as follows .",
    "the l.h.s .  of the trace formula that we are going to derive reads @xmath1 where the @xmath2 s are the quantum mechanical eigenvalues , which depend on @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denotes a variable parameter .",
    "the smooth test function @xmath5 decreases faster than any power for large arguments so that the main contribution to the sum comes from eigenvalues within an interval of length proportinal to @xmath3 , @xmath6 in the formal limit @xmath0 the weyl law forces the spectral density to increase in such a way that , although the length of the interval ( [ sclimit ] ) shrinks to zero , infinitely many terms contribute to ( [ eq_lhs ] ) .",
    "in other words , the semiclassical limit corresponds to the limit of an increasing spectral density .",
    "the latter can possibly be achieved in a variety of different ways , which sometimes makes it necessary to vary several external parameters simultaneously . in case",
    "the limit @xmath0 is accompanied by further limits , one then has to ensure that asymptotic expansions are uniform in the quantities that are involved in the further limits . throughout this paper",
    "we will understand the semiclassical limit as being involved with the formal asymptotics as @xmath0 . in the last section , where we investigate the nonrelativistic approximation of the results obtained for the dirac equation",
    ", we briefly discuss an example with a second , simultaneous limit .    in the following sections we will develop the steps that are necessary to derive a trace formula for the dirac equation in some detail .",
    "basically we follow the method introduced by gutzwiller @xcite in the case of the schrdinger equation .",
    "it turns out that regarding the translational degrees of freedom gutzwiller s approach can indeed be taken over .",
    "the novel features that arise in the case of the dirac equation derive from the spin degrees of freedom and their coupling to the translational dynamics . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we first fix our notation and recall the basic properties of the dirac equation relevant for the following",
    ". then we review the general rle of periodic orbits in semiclassical trace formulae and introduce a regularisation procedure ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which allows to obtain convergent trace formulae .",
    "we moreover recall how to cut off the essential spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian , which is present in most physically relevant situations and typically covers @xmath7 \\cup [ mc^2,\\infty)$ ] .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the derivation of a semiclassical time evolution kernel in the spirit of the van vleck formula known for the respective kernel for the schrdinger equation . in the present context",
    "we find it convenient to represent the time evolution kernel in terms of an oscillatory integral .",
    "this method was developed for the study of scalar wave equations in the context of microlocal analysis , see e.  g.   @xcite , and subsequently found application to the development of several trace formulae @xcite . in the case of the schrdinger equation it leads to the same result as gutzwiller s original derivation @xcite which employed a stationary phase approximation of a feynman path integral .",
    "the approach that we are going to follow is similar to the usual wkb method and results in equations that determine the coefficients of an @xmath3-expansion of the time evolution kernel .",
    "the presence of spin is reflected in these equations through their matrix character .",
    "to lowest order one obtains as a condition for their solvability two hamilton - jacobi equations , which correspond to the classical dynamics of relativistic point particles with positive and negative kinetic energy , respectively . the condition that arises in next - to - leading order in @xmath3",
    "is usually called transport equation .",
    "the latter can be reduced to two differential equations for @xmath8 matrices describing the transport of the spin degrees of freedom along particle orbits .",
    "the solutions of these spin transport equations as well as the solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equations finally determine the leading order of the semiclassical expansion for the time evolution operator .",
    "it is remarkable that the classical hamiltonians do not include any term corresponding to forces acting on the magnetic moment of the spin .",
    "this fact was already realised by pauli in his wkb treatment of the dirac equation , see also a related discussion in @xcite .",
    "for this reason pauli s method was subsequently criticized by de  broglie @xcite , who argued that electromagnetic moments linked with the spin were classical quantities and therefore should be present in a semiclassical approximation .",
    "this objection was later clarified by rubinow and keller @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the moments of an electron are proportional to @xmath3 so that in leading order as @xmath9 the influence of spin on the trajectories vanishes",
    ". furthermore , they showed how to obtain the equation describing the thomas precession @xcite of a classical spin , which is also known as the bmt - equation @xcite , from the transport equation .",
    "since it only contains the ratio of the magnetic moment and the spin , @xmath3 cancels from the equation of thomas precession which therefore provides the correct description of a classical spin .    in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we analyse the spin transport in more detail , where we mainly focus on two aspects .",
    "we first discuss the geometric terms that accompany semiclassical asymptotics of multicomponent wave equations as they follow from the transport equation .",
    "their structure is of a similar form as discovered by littlejohn and flynn @xcite in the case of wave equations with classical hamiltonian matrices that have no ( globally ) degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "in particular , one contribution is identified as being of the same type as the berry phase @xcite appearing in adiabatic approximations .",
    "however , since in the case of the dirac equation the eigenvalues of the classical hamiltonian matrix are twofold degenerate , the u(1)-holonomy factors of littlejohn and flynn are replaced by corresponding su(2 ) terms .",
    "our results are found to be in accordance with the general discussion of the transport equation for multicomponent wave equations by emmrich and weinstein @xcite .",
    "in addition , these authors revealed the global geometric meaning of all terms that contribute to the total holonomy following from the transport equation .",
    "as a second point we discuss how to express also the spin contributions to the semiclassical time evolution kernel in terms of classical quantities . to this end we introduce a classical spin vector @xmath10 as an expectation value of a time dependent spin operator .",
    "it then follows from the spin transport equation that @xmath10 has to fulfill the classical equation of thomas precession .",
    "thus , up to a phase factor the desired solution of the spin transport equation is determined by the classical spin precession along a given particle orbit .",
    "we also show that the additional phase factor is composed of a dynamical part associated with the energy of a classical magnetic moment in given electromagnetic fields , and a geometric part which is of the type discovered by aharonov and anandan @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec5 ] we derive the semiclassical trace formula for the dirac equation , which is our central result , by fourier transforming from the time domain to the energy domain and by subsequently taking the trace over spatial variables and matrix components .",
    "the periodic orbits that enter the trace formula are determined by the relativistic dynamics of classical point particles without internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the influence of the spin appears through two phase factors every periodic orbit is weighted by .",
    "one of these phases measures the change in the direction of the classical spin after this has been transported along a periodic orbit , whereas the second one contains the phase described above as being composed of a dynamical and a geometric part .",
    "finally , in section [ sec6 ] we consider the nonrelativistic limit of the results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "it turns out that the leading order as @xmath11 coincides with the result of an application of the above programme to the pauli equation .",
    "this equation is also of independent interest because in applications it is often used to investigate spin - orbit coupling .",
    "based on the method developed in @xcite , this important effect is e.  g.  treated semiclassically in @xcite .",
    "frisk and guhr @xcite introduced a trace formula for a nonrelativistic hamiltonian that describes spin - orbit coupling by modifying the berry - tabor trace formula @xcite for classically integrable systems without spin . to be able to use the formalism of @xcite they kept bohr s magneton",
    "@xmath12 fixed as @xmath9 ; otherwise the corresponding classical hamiltonian matrix would have a twofold degenerate eigenvalue .",
    "this procedure is in contrast to our method which allows to treat @xmath3 on the same footing in all terms .",
    "fixing bohr s magneton can be regarded as simultanously performing the limit @xmath9 and the limit of an infinite coupling of spin to the translational degrees of freedom . in the semiclassical expressions",
    "the spin precession then decouples adiabatically from the translational motion .",
    "for the pauli equation that describes a coupling of spin to an external magnetic field we compare two ways of performing the semiclassical limit : ( i ) @xmath13 and ( ii ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 in the first case the nonrelativisitic limit of the result for the dirac equation emerges , where the geometric terms in the spin transport are su(2)-holonomy factors . in the second case the adiabatic decoupling of the spin motion results in geometric terms that yield a u(1 ) holonomy such that the berry phase of a precessing spin is recovered . both results being different implies that the semiclassical limit @xmath9 is not uniform in the magnetic field strength , a result that sheds some light on de  broglie s criticism of pauli s approach .",
    "in this section we will present the basis for our subsequent discussion of semiclassical methods for the dirac equation . in the following our focus will be on relativistic particles of charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 with spin 1/2 in external static electromagnetic fields . thus the relevant dirac equation reads @xmath18 with the quantum hamiltonian @xmath19 which is a matrix - valued differential operator of first order . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the electromagnetic potentials such that the corresponding fields are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the dirac algebra is realised by the @xmath24 matrices @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath27 is the @xmath28 unit matrix ; see @xcite for further details .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ diracham ] ) can be realised as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the symbol matrix , in the sense of weyl quantisation , of the operator @xmath31 ( see e.  g. @xcite ) . in case the potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 satisfy suitable regularity conditions , the dirac hamiltonian @xmath31 , when defined on the domain @xmath32 in the hilbert space @xmath33 , is essentially self - adjoint ; see e.  g.  @xcite . in the following we will always deal with its self - adjoint extension which we also denote by @xmath31 .",
    "solutions @xmath34 of the dirac equation ( [ diraceqn ] ) , with initial conditions @xmath35 , are obtained as @xmath36 .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath37 can then be represented by its schwartz kernel @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 this matrix - valued kernel is obviously required to solve the dirac equation , with initial condition @xmath40 our first major goal , to be dealt with in the next section , will be to derive a semiclassical representation of the time evolution kernel @xmath38 in the spirit of the van  vleck formula for the respective kernel of the schrdinger equation . in the latter case",
    "such a representation is usually derived from a feynman path integral , to which the method of stationary phase is applied @xcite .",
    "here we prefer an alternative semiclassical approach that makes use of a representation of the kernel in terms of an oscillatory integral .",
    "this method has previously also proven useful in the case of the schrdinger equation , see e.  g.  @xcite , in which it served as a basis for a mathematically rigorous proof @xcite of the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite .",
    "we therefore now introduce the matrix - valued oscillatory integral @xmath41 \\ { \\text{d}}^3\\xi\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 are real - valued smooth phase functions that are independent of @xmath3 , and @xmath43 are @xmath24 matrices with semiclassical expansions @xmath44 according to the general theory of schwartz kernels , @xmath38 is a distribution kernel so that the integral ( [ oscillint ] ) has to be interpreted in a distributional sense , see e.  g.  @xcite for details in the scalar case . in order to account for the initial condition ( [ incond ] ) one chooses @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "since the kernel ( [ oscillint ] ) has to solve the dirac equation , one obtains conditions for the phases @xmath42 and the coefficients @xmath47 appearing in the matrix - valued amplitudes @xmath43 .",
    "a detailed discussion of these equations will be postponed to the next section .",
    "here we only remark that the phase functions have to satisfy the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath48 with the classical hamiltonians @xmath49 of relativistic particles with positive @xmath50 and negative @xmath51 kinetic energies , respectively . as can readily be verified , the functions @xmath52 are the two , twofold degenerate , eigenvalues of the symbol matrix ( [ symbmat ] ) .",
    "a posteriori , the occurrence of two hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjg ] ) justifies the choice ( [ oscillint ] ) of the oscillatory integral with two additive contributions .    due to the form ( [ hjg ] ) of the hamilton - jacobi equations and the initial conditions ( [ phiini ] ) ,",
    "the variable @xmath53 can be separated according to @xmath54 so that the functions @xmath55 also solve the hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjg ] ) , but with initial conditions @xmath56 . from general hamilton - jacobi theory ,",
    "see e.  g.   @xcite , it is known that therefore @xmath55 are generating functions for canonical transformations @xmath57 .",
    "for ease of notation we restrict the following discussion to the index @xmath58 .",
    "then @xmath59 are the end points of the solution @xmath60 of hamilton s equations of motion , generated by the hamiltonian @xmath61 , with initial condition @xmath62 .",
    "this means that @xmath63 in order to explicitly incorporate the initial conditions we will also use the notation @xmath64 the fact that @xmath65 is a generating function for the associated canonical transformation moreover implies the relations @xmath66 for sufficiently small times , @xmath67 , the hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjg ] ) are known to possess unique solutions @xmath68 , see e.  g. @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that at some critical time @xmath69 a caustic may arise so that for @xmath70 the solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equations are no longer unique .",
    "the representation ( [ oscillint ] ) of the time evolution kernel for @xmath70 can then only be a local one .",
    "a global object has to be constructed by gluing appropriate local representations together .",
    "this procedure requires consistency conditions , which are reflected by the presence of morse indices in the final semiclassical expression to be derived in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "for the schrdinger equation this was already noticed by gutzwiller @xcite . a mathematically rigorous construction employing the maslov bundle can be found in @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will neglect this problem below in that we continue to work with ( [ oscillint ] ) and only in the end introduce the appropriate phase factors .",
    "since the principal applications of semiclassical trace formulae deal with eigenvalues of quantum hamiltonians , in particular with their semiclassical determination and their statistical properties , respectively , one would like to isolate the point spectrum of @xmath31 from its essential spectrum . in case",
    "the potentials @xmath71 and @xmath21 vanish towards spatial infinity , or under suitably weakened conditions , the essential spectrum is known to be given by @xmath72 , see e.  g.   @xcite , so that for the following we assume @xmath31 to have , possibly infinitely many , eigenvalues of finite multiplicities in the interval @xmath73 .",
    "given any interval @xmath74 that contains only isolated eigenvalues , we introduce a smooth function @xmath75 that is supported in @xmath76 , i.  e. , it vanishes outside of @xmath76 , such that @xmath77 on a suitably large subinterval . in particular , if there is no accumulation of eigenvalues at @xmath78 or @xmath79 , one can achieve that @xmath80 for all eigenvalues @xmath2 of @xmath31 . otherwise , as e.  g.   for the dirac hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom",
    ", one can enlarge the support of @xmath81 arbitrarily towards @xmath82 so that arbitrarily many eigenvalues can be taken into account . then the operator @xmath83 , defined by the functional calculus given by the spectral theorem , is bounded and self - adjoint ; see e.  g.  @xcite for the scalar case .",
    "this operator has a purely discrete spectrum with eigenvalues @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the schwartz kernel @xmath85 of the truncated time evolution operator @xmath86 has a spectral representation @xmath87 in terms of the orthonormal eigenspinors @xmath88 of @xmath31 , where @xmath89 denotes the hermitian adjoint of @xmath88 . according to the definition of the truncated time evolution operator , which implies that @xmath90 the truncated kernel is obtained from the non - truncated one as @xmath91 \\ { \\text{d}}^3\\xi\\ ; \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath83 always acts on functions of @xmath92 . in the framework of weyl calculus one",
    "can identify the symbol of the operator @xmath83 to possess a semiclassical expansion with principal symbol ( leading term ) @xmath93 , see @xcite .",
    "thus , an explicit calculation yields that @xmath94 for any sufficiently regular matrix - valued function @xmath95 and real - valued function @xmath96 .",
    "this calculation is closely parallel to the respective result in the scalar case , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "notice that in @xcite a different quantisation is used which , however , yields to lowest semiclassical order the same result as weyl quantisation .",
    "thus , to leading order in @xmath3 , the truncated time evolution kernel reads @xmath97\\ { \\text{d}}^3\\xi \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] in order to prepare for the semiclassical trace formula to be dealt with in section [ sec5 ] we now introduce a regularisation of the truncated time evolution operator . to this end",
    "consider a smooth test function @xmath98 such that its fourier transform @xmath99 is smooth and compactly supported .",
    "then in particular , both @xmath5 and @xmath100 are test functions from the schwartz space @xmath101 .",

    "one requires that @xmath109 the simplest case of finitely many eigenvalues in the support of @xmath81 obviously poses no problem . if , however , eigenvalues accumulate at some @xmath110 $ ] , the truncation @xmath81 has to be chosen such that @xmath111 and , moreover , @xmath75 vanishes sufficiently fast as @xmath112 in order to fulfill ( [ trconve ] ) .",

    "the details of this procedure will be carried out in section [ sec5 ] .",

    "a comparison with the relations ( [ generfct ] ) now yields the conditions @xmath122 and @xmath123 , so that the stationary points determine periodic solutions , with energy @xmath4 , of hamilton s equations of motion generated by the hamiltonians ( [ classham ] ) .",
    "we denote these periodic orbits by @xmath124 .",
    "their periods , given by the @xmath125-components of the corresponding stationary points , are called @xmath126 . notice",
    "that our requirement on the test function @xmath100 to have compact support implies that only periodic orbits up to some finite period , @xmath127 , contribute .",
    "however , since the support of @xmath100 can be made arbitrarily large one can manage to include as many periodic orbits as desired . as our first observation on the way towards a semiclassical trace formula",
    "we thus now conclude that , apart from terms of @xmath116 , in the semiclassical limit @xmath0 all contributions to the l.h.s .  of ( [ pretrace ] )",
    "are due to classical periodic orbits of energy @xmath4 of relativistic point particles",
    ".    a further observation can be made with ( [ statphint ] ) if the set of stationary points @xmath117 divides into a sequence @xmath128 , @xmath129 , of @xmath130-dimensional smooth submanifolds of @xmath131 such that the phase @xmath132 is non - degenerate transversal to the manifolds @xmath128 .",
    "the latter condition means that the matrix of second derivatives of the phase with respect to @xmath117 has constant rank @xmath133 when restricted to @xmath128 .",
    "the flow generated by @xmath134 is then called clean , see @xcite for further details .",
    "in this situation the set of periods is known to be discrete in @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "thus the periods can not accumulate at some finite value @xmath136 . under these conditions",
    "the method of stationary phase implies that each manifold @xmath128 yields a contribution @xmath137 to ( [ pretrace ] ) . here",
    "@xmath138 is the action of any periodic orbit @xmath124 contained in @xmath128 , which can be computed as the integral of the canonical one - form @xmath139 along any closed path on @xmath128 .",

    "the points @xmath144 are obviously periodic under the flows generated by @xmath134 , with trivial period @xmath145 .",
    "since according to the above non - degeneracy condition we assume that @xmath146 are ( five dimensional ) smooth manifolds , @xmath4 is required to be a regular value for the respective flows .",
    "moreover , the associated leading terms in ( [ genterm ] ) are of the order @xmath147 .",
    "the explicit calculation of @xmath148 will also be performed in section [ sec5 ] . as a final remark",
    "let us mention that in case the dynamics generated by @xmath134 are integrable , phase space foliates into three dimensional invariant tori such that the respective manifolds @xmath128 are given by the rational ones among these tori .",
    "thus @xmath149 so that the leading terms in ( [ genterm ] ) are of the order @xmath150 .",
    "in this section we will determine semiclassical representations for the time evolution kernel @xmath38 and its truncated version @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "in a first step we derive necessary conditions that must be imposed on the matrix - valued amplitudes @xmath43 and on the real - valued phases @xmath42 in order that the oscillatory integral ( [ oscillint ] ) be a possible ansatz for the time evolution kernel . in a second step",
    "we then employ the method of stationary phase to ( [ oscillint ] ) , and from the result we obtain a semiclassical expression in the spirit of the van  vleck formula for the respective kernel of the schrdinger equation .    the requirement",
    "that ( [ oscillint ] ) , together with the expansion ( [ scamplitude ] ) , be a semiclassical representation of the kernel @xmath38 to all orders in @xmath3 means that the oscillatory integral shall fulfill the dirac equation ( [ diraceqn ] ) up to terms @xmath116 .",

    "however , in order to identify the connection on the hopf fibration it turns out that a choice of either @xmath325 or @xmath326 separately is more approppriate . since the north pole of @xmath312 corresponds to @xmath327 and the south pole to @xmath328 , the phase @xmath325 is ill - defined at the south pole , whereas @xmath326 is ill - defined at the north pole . following the procedure well known from the analysis of magnetic monopoles by wu and yang @xcite , we now choose @xmath325 as a fibre coordinate for base points on the northern hemisphere @xmath329 and , correspondingly , @xmath326 for base points on the southern hemisphere @xmath330 .",
    "since the connection we want to identify is fixed by the requirement that the lifted curve on su(2 ) be the solution @xmath313 of ( [ dtranseq ] ) , an explicit expression for the connection coefficients can be derived from the equation @xmath331 that follows from the identification ( [ albeid ] ) .",

    "the latter can be further characterised once one takes into account that @xmath325 is ill - defined at the south pole so that the phase @xmath340 should be used instead of @xmath325 as soon as @xmath10 enters @xmath335 , say , at a time @xmath341 .",
    "one then has to integrate ( [ lambdadgl ] ) with initial condition @xmath342 .",
    "to this end the one - form @xmath343 , which constitutes the geometric part of ( [ etaoft ] ) , has to be replaced by @xmath344 , see ( [ lambdadgl ] ) .",
    "since these two expressions are the gauge potentials of a magnetic monopole , see @xcite , we can now formally identify the geometric part of ( [ etaoft ] ) to be caused by a magnetic monopole of strength @xmath345 situated at the origin of the sphere .",
    "we again emphasize that in the above consideration no adiabaticity assumption was made .",
    "therefore , although the result for the geometric phase is strikingly similar to the berry phase of a precessing quantum mechanical spin @xcite , the geometric part of @xmath325 is rather of the more general type discussed by aharonov and anandan @xcite .",

    "it is then possible to choose a smooth function @xmath360 whose ( connected ) support contains the period @xmath145 , but no further period @xmath361 .",

    "evaluated at @xmath205 , the expression ( [ phaseexp ] ) shows that this yields the condition @xmath372 to be fulfilled by the stationary points @xmath373 .",

    "as a starting point we consider the r.h.s .  of ( [ pretrace ] ) , in which we introduce the semiclassical representation ( [ ksemicl ] ) of the truncated time evolution kernel .",

    "the semiclassical asymptotics ( [ ksemicl ] ) , which was derived with @xmath125 held fixed , can therefore be used in ( [ pocontrib ] ) without running into conflict with a need to perform @xmath351 .",
    "apart from the factors caused by the spin degrees of freedom in ( [ ksemicl ] ) , and from the fact that the two relativistic classical hamiltonians @xmath158 determine the equations of motion for the translational degrees of freedom , the following calculation is closely parallel to the case of the schrdinger equation @xcite .    as implied by the discussion at the end of section [ sec2 ] , the stationary points relevant for the semiclassical evaluation of ( [ pocontrib ] ) , which we now express as @xmath384\\,\\tilde\\varrho(t)\\ , \\left\\ { \\sum_{{\\gamma}_{xx}^+}\\chi(e_{{\\gamma}_{xx}^+ } )       \\operatorname{tr}\\left ( v_t\\,d_+\\,v_0^\\dagger \\right)\\,d^+_{{\\gamma}_{xx}^+}\\ ,       { \\text{e}}^{\\frac{{\\text{i}}}{\\hbar}[r^+_{{\\gamma}_{xx}^+}+et]-{\\text{i}}\\frac{\\pi}{2 }       \\nu_{{\\gamma}_{xx}}^+ } \\right . + \\\\     & \\left .",

    "indeed , the stationary points of the phases appearing in ( [ ksemiinsert ] ) are determined by @xmath385_{{\\vec{y}}={\\vec{x}}}=0 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad -\\frac{\\partial r^\\pm_{{\\gamma}_{xx}^\\pm}}{\\partial t}({\\vec{x}},{\\vec{x}},t ) = e \\ .\\ ] ] the first relation requires that initial and final momenta of those closed trajectories @xmath386 that contribute to the method of stationary phase must coincide , so that these are indeed periodic .",
    "the second condition then picks out those periodic orbits that are contained in the hypersurfaces @xmath358 . at stationary points",
    "the phases then read @xmath387 in order to apply the method of stationary phase to ( [ ksemiinsert ] ) we assume that all periodic orbits are isolated and non - degenerate . strictly speaking ,",
    "one now has to introduce a partition of unity that separates the contributions of the isolated orbits .",
    "since their periods are known not to accumulate at some finite value @xmath136 , this can be done in the same manner as for the trivial period @xmath145 above .",
    "the only difference to the case of the schrdinger equation is caused by the presence of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this is represented through the matrix trace under the integral in ( [ ksemiinsert ] ) . at stationary points , however , @xmath388 and the periodicity implies that @xmath389 .",
    "thus a cyclic permutation under the matrix trace together with the former result ( [ d+result ] ) yields @xmath390 finishing the calculation as in the well known case of the schrdinger equation @xcite finally yields a contribution of @xmath391 for every isolated non - degenerate periodic orbit @xmath124 . here",
    "the amplitude @xmath392 contains only classical information about the periodic orbit , including the contribution of a classical spin precessing along the orbit .",
    "explicitly , the amplitude reads @xmath393 in this expression @xmath394 denotes the primitive period of @xmath124 , i.  e. , the period of the associated primitive periodic orbit .",
    "moreover , @xmath395 is the linearised poincar map ( monodromy matrix ) along the orbit and @xmath396 is its maslov index .    from the gutzwiller trace formula",
    "it is well known that if @xmath124 is not primitive , all quantities that enter ( [ pocont ] ) , apart from the spin contribution ( [ spincont ] ) , can be readily expressed in terms of the respective quantities of the associated primitive periodic orbit . in order to extend this to ( [ spincont ] )",
    "we recall that if @xmath124 is a @xmath188-fold repetition of a primitive orbit , where @xmath397 , the fact that @xmath398 is a holonomy implies that @xmath399 , where @xmath400 denotes the corresponding primitive holonomy .",
    "according to @xcite the trace ( [ spincont ] ) associated with @xmath124 can hence be expressed as @xmath401 where @xmath402 is the @xmath188-th chebyshev polynomial of the second kind in @xmath403 .",
    "thus , if desired , the following trace formulae ( [ semtf ] ) and ( [ denstf ] ) can also be expressed in terms of sums over primitive periodic orbits and their repetitions .    in case",
    "the classical dynamics generated by the hamiltonians @xmath134 have only isolated non - degenerate periodic orbits , the relations ( [ weyl ] ) and ( [ pocont ] ) now enable us to state the following semiclassical trace formula explicitly , @xmath404 the conditions imposed on the test function @xmath5 and its fourier transform ensure that all expressions entering this trace formula are finite .",
    "in particular , due to the compact support of @xmath100 the sum over periodic orbits only includes orbits up to a finite period and since the hamiltonian flow generated by @xmath52 was supposed to be clean the sum is of finite length .",
    "often a semiclassical trace formula is presented for the spectral density of the quantum hamiltonian , see e.  g.  @xcite .",
    "in the present case one can readily obtain such a trace formula for the truncated spectral density @xmath405 from ( [ semtf ] ) .",
    "this reads @xmath406 obviously , the sum over classical periodic orbits in ( [ denstf ] ) does not converge .",
    "this trace formula rather has to be viewed as a distributional identity whose actual meaning is provided by ( [ semtf ] ) .",
    "as compared to the schrdinger equation , the dirac equation takes two generalisations into account .",
    "it first takes care of the spin degrees of freedom and , secondly , describes relativistic dynamics . in many situations of physical interest",
    "it , however , suffices only to include spin and to leave the description of the translational motion on a nonrelativistic level .",
    "as it is well known , this can be achieved by considering the pauli equation , possibly with several additional terms such as one describing spin - orbit coupling . in this section",
    "we therefore want to study particles of charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 with spin 1/2 in a nonrelativistic context . to this end",
    "we compare the semiclassical asymptotics for the pauli equation with the leading order as @xmath11 of the time evolution kernel ( [ ksemicl ] ) for the dirac equation . both approaches , which will turn out to produce identical results , then allow to set up a semiclassical trace formula .",
    "we recall that when one divides a dirac four - spinor @xmath407 into two - spinors @xmath408 according to @xmath409 one obtains from ( [ diraceqn ] ) two coupled matrix differential equations .",

    "we remark that the decomposition of the su(2 ) matrix @xmath228 into a classical spin @xmath10 and an additional phase @xmath325 presented in section [ sec4 ] can be repeated in the present , nonrelativistic , context .",

    "an additional phase , @xmath438 representing the third , nonclassical , degree of freedom of @xmath439 , appears in the same manner as for the dirac equation . this phase is again composed of a dynamical and a geometric part .",
    "a calculation similar to that presented in section [ sec3 ] finally leads to the following semiclassical time evolution kernel for the pauli equation ( for @xmath237 ) , @xmath440 on the r.h.s .",
    "the sum extends over the solutions of hamilton s equations of motion with the classical hamiltonian @xmath428 , which connect @xmath53 and @xmath92 in time @xmath125 .",

    "the factor @xmath443 is defined by @xmath444 since these quantities are already determined by the nonrelativistic classical dynamics generated by @xmath422 , the only difference between ( [ kscpauli ] ) and the respective semiclassical kernel for the schrdinger equation is an appearence of the factors @xmath445 that represent the leading influence of spin .",
    "so far we have examined the propagator that emerges from first taking the nonrelativistic limit of the dirac equation and then constructing a semiclassical time evolution kernel .",
    "we will now compare this to the result that one obtains by first constructing the relativistic semiclassical kernel ( [ ksemicl ] ) and then taking the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "we are thus now interested in the leading order behaviour of ( [ ksemicl ] ) as @xmath446 . to this end we first remark that @xmath447 i.  e. , in leading order the positive and negative kinetic energy parts in ( [ ksemicl ] ) decouple completely .",
    "we therefore have to compare ( [ kscpauli ] ) with the upper left @xmath8 block of ( [ ksemicl ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with ( [ d+pspinor ] ) because this block describes the time evolution of the two - spinor @xmath448 .",
    "we furthermore recall the well known fact that the classical relativistic dynamics described by @xmath253 turns into the nonrelativistic dynamics with the classical hamiltonian @xmath428 as @xmath410 .",
    "this in particular implies that @xmath449 , @xmath450 , @xmath451 and @xmath452 may in leading order be approximated by @xmath453 , @xmath454 , @xmath455 and @xmath456 .",
    "we are therefore only left with comparing the factors @xmath228 and @xmath439 which describe the influence of spin in a relativistic and in a nonrelativistic context , respectively .",
    "as already mentioned below equation ( [ nonrelbmt ] ) @xmath457 leads to a nonrelativistic approximation for both the classical spin dynamics and the nonclassical phase .",
    "thus @xmath439 provides the leading order asymptotical term for @xmath228 as @xmath11 . collecting everything",
    "one observes that in the nonrelativistic limit the upper left block of the semiclassical time evolution kernel ( [ ksemicl ] ) for the dirac equation turns into the respective result ( [ kscpauli ] ) for the pauli equation . in this sense",

    "we now assume that @xmath458 has a pure point spectrum .",
    "otherwise we would have to employ an energy localisation to a gap in the essential spectrum as described in section [ sec2 ] for the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "we then consider a test function @xmath459 with compactly supported fourier transform @xmath100 . applying the procedure of section [ sec5 ] to @xmath458 finally yields @xmath460 where the sum extends over the periodic orbits of the classical dynamics generated by the principal symbol @xmath422 .",
    "in fact , all classical quantities entering ( [ paulitf ] ) refer to this hamiltonian .",
    "as explained in the relativistic case , for such a trace formula to be valid the flow generated by @xmath422 must be clean .",
    "the amplitude associated with each isolated , non - degenerate periodic orbit then reads @xmath461 a different semiclassical approach to the pauli equation has previously been used to investigate spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "the authors of these papers principally base their method on the technique developed by littlejohn and flynn @xcite to treat matrix - valued wave operators with principal symbols that have no ( globally ) degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "below we will derive the time evolution according to the prescription of the semiclassical limit employed in @xcite , however , using the techniques outlined in the previous sections .",
    "for simplicity , and for ease of comparison with our previous semiclassical study of the pauli equation , we will not consider spin - orbit coupling but only a coupling of spin to the external magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the relevant hamiltonian is the one defined in ( [ paulieqn ] ) .",
    "however , a generalisation of the following discussion to arbitrary couplings of the form @xmath462 is straight forward .",
    "following now the philosophy of @xcite , we introduce bohr s magneton @xmath463 and consider it as constant in the semiclassical limit .",
    "thus the hamiltonian @xmath464 arises as a weyl operator associated with the symbol @xmath465 so that no subprincipal symbol occurs . as opposed to the situation analysed at the beginning of this section",

    "obtains the equation @xmath479            + { \\text{i}}{m'}_p^+ ( { \\vec{\\nabla}}_{{\\vec{x}}}s^+,{\\vec{x } } ) \\right ]            \\tilde v^\\dagger = 0 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath480 on the r.h.s . , the factor @xmath481 is the well known expression for the adiabatic connection leading to the u(1)-berry phase of a precessing spin @xcite .",
    "again , the transport equations for @xmath159 will be solved along the classical trajectories @xmath482 following from the hamiltonians ( [ modham ] ) . as suggested by ( [ d+def ] ) and ( [ d+def ] ) , one separates @xmath483 so that along a trajectory @xmath484 the phase @xmath485 has to solve the equation @xmath486 { d'}_+(t ) = 0\\ ,   \\qquad { d'}_+(0 ) = 1 \\ .\\ ] ] as a result , one obtains the well known u(1)-berry phase of a quantum mechanical spin that has been transported adiabatically along the trajectory @xmath484 .",
    "finally , the semiclassical time evolution kernel reads @xmath487 where all classical quantities refer to the dynamics generated by the hamiltonians ( [ modham ] ) and are defined in analogy to the previous cases .",
    "in particular , hamilton s principal functions @xmath488 are related to the analogous quantities @xmath489 that are defined by the hamiltonian ( [ prinsymb ] ) , but here evaluated along the trajectories @xmath490 , through @xmath491 due to the factors @xmath492 in ( [ kpmod ] ) the ` spin up ' and ` spin down ' components of an initial spinor @xmath493 are propagated independently along the corresponding trajectories following from the hamiltonians @xmath494 . here ` spin up ' and ` spin down ' are defined with respect to the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field .",
    "this procedure breaks down at mode conversion points , i.  e. , at points where the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "there the symbol matrix ( [ modsymb ] ) has one twofold degenerate eigenvalue and the level surfaces of the two hamiltonians @xmath494 cross .",
    "moreover , since @xmath495 develops a singularity , the classical trajectories are not smooth when crossing a mode conversion point . in certain situations",
    "this defect can be cured by letting the trajectories cross the two level surfaces , see @xcite , but in general an application of the present semiclassical procedure requires a more refined treatment of mode conversion points , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .    at this place",
    "one could easily establish the corresponding semiclassical trace formula , if one followed the programme outlined in section [ sec2 ] once again .",
    "however , we refrain from doing this here and rather comment on the relation between the two semiclassical approaches to the pauli equation discussed in this chapter , which lead to the two distinct expressions ( [ kscpauli ] ) and ( [ kpmod ] ) for the time evolution kernel . in the first scenario we systematically performed an expansion in @xmath3 and determined the leading order terms for the time evolution kernel and for the classical side of the trace formula .",
    "we observed that to lowest order the translational degrees of freedom decouple from the spin degrees of freedom in that the translational motion experiences no back reaction from the coupling of spin to the external magnetic field . in a certain sense",
    "this decoupling can be seen as an adiabatic one where the translational motion is considered as slow , although this condition is not needed for the formulae to be valid .",
    "this topic was also discussed by balian and bloch @xcite in the context of semiclassical approximations for the green function .",
    "spin enters in next - to - leading order and , among other quantities , determines the amplitudes in the relevant semiclassical expressions .",
    "the leading order of the spin dynamics is given by that of a classical spin precessing along the particle trajectories .",
    "we have repeatedly emphasized that at this stage no adiabatic limit is considered .",
    "in addition , a geometric phase of the type discussed by aharonov and anandan @xcite enters the amplitudes . in the second scenario we considered the double limit @xmath0 , @xmath496 , @xmath467 .",
    "it turned out that in this context the relevant classical translational motion follows from two hamiltonians , taking the effect of a coupling of a ` spin up ' and a ` spin down ' , respectively , to the external magnetic field into account . since in this context , via the expressions @xmath497 in ( [ kpmod ] ) , the spin direction is defined with respect to the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field , the spin degrees of freedom are transported adiabatically along the particle trajectories .",
    "there is no further dynamical equation for a classical spin and , as a consequence of the limit @xmath496 , the berry phase that enters can be viewed as emerging from an adiabatic approximation of the geometric term found in the first scenario .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the remark on the relation of these phases that can be found in @xcite . in order to be more specific concerning the issue of adiabaticity , we introduce spherical coordinates @xmath498 for @xmath499 which allows to obtain an explicit expression for the berry phase emerging from ( [ berryph ] ) .",
    "moreover , we reintroduce @xmath500 for the magneton @xmath501 . using ( [ randr ] )",
    "one thus observes that @xmath502 which can be introduced in ( [ kpmod ] ) .",
    "the first factor on the r.h.s .",
    "is readily identified to arise as an adiabatic approximation to @xmath503 , if the phase ( [ etaoftnr ] ) is evaluated along the trajectory @xmath484 instead of @xmath434 .",
    "thus the spin contributions to ( [ kpmod ] ) are adiabatic approximations to the respective contributions to ( [ kscpauli ] ) .",
    "conversely , one concludes that in the semiclassical time evolution according to ( [ kscpauli ] ) the spin transport is performed non - adiabatically so that mode conversion poses no difficulty . in conclusion , one can consider the two alternative ways of performing the semiclassical limit as being considered with a ` weak ' and a ` strong ' coupling , respectively , of spin to the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "comparing the two results ( [ kscpauli ] ) and ( [ kpmod ] ) for the time evolution kernel one notices that the two approaches yield different results when extended to intermediate couplings . in the first case the translational motion",
    "is not influenced by the spin , whose dynamics in turn is not treated adiabatically . in the second case , however , spin has an effect on the translational motion , but the spin dynamics enters in an adiabatic approximation .",
    "this observation illustrates the fact that the @xmath3-expansions employed are not uniform in the field strength ."
