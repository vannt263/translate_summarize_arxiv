    "lattice qcd calculations of meson - meson interactions have yielded predictions for physical scattering lengths at the few percent level  @xcite .",
    "several reasons underlie this striking accuracy .",
    "firstly , at the level of the lattice calculation , euclidean - space correlation functions involving pseudoscalar mesons have signal / noise ratios that do not degrade , or only slowly degrade with time . therefore , highly accurate fits of both single- and multi - meson properties are possible with currently available supercomputer resources .",
    "recent calculations of multi - meson interactions relevant for the study of pion and kaon condensation have been performed with up to twelve mesons interacting on a lattice  @xcite with no appreciable degradation of signal / noise with time . secondly , and perhaps more importantly ,",
    "qcd correlation functions involving goldstone bosons are subject to powerful chiral symmetry constraints .",
    "since current lattice calculations are carried out at unphysical quark masses , these constraints play an essential role in extrapolating the lattice data to the physical quark masses , as well as to the infinite volume , and continuum limits .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7-pt ) is the optimal method for implementing qcd constraints due to chiral symmetry , and in essence , provides an expansion of low - energy s - matrix elements in quark masses and powers of momentum  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the purely mesonic sector , recent studies of baryon - baryon interactions , the paradigmatic nuclear physics process , have demonstrated the fundamental difficulty faced in making predictions for baryons and their interactions  @xcite . unlike the mesons",
    ", correlation functions involving baryons suffer an exponential degradation of signal / noise at large times   and therefore pose a fundamentally different kind of challenge in extracting signal from data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while baryon interactions are constrained by qcd symmetries like chiral symmetry , the constraints are not nearly as powerful as when there is at least one pion or kaon in the initial or final state .",
    "for instance , there is no expectation that the baryon - baryon scattering lengths vanish in the chiral limit as they do in the purely mesonic sector . in nucleon - nucleon scattering ,",
    "the s - wave interactions are actually enhanced due to the close proximity of a non - trivial fixed point of the renormalization group , which drives the scattering lengths to infinity , thus rendering the effective field theory description of the interaction highly non - perturbative  @xcite .",
    "given the contrast in difficulty between the purely mesonic and purely baryonic sectors described above , it is clearly of great interest to perform a lattice qcd investigation of the simplest scattering process involving at least one baryon : meson - baryon scattering .",
    "while pion - nucleon scattering is the best - studied process , both theoretically and experimentally , its determination on the lattice is computationally prohibitive since it involves annihilation diagrams . at present only a few limiting cases that involve these diagrams are being investigated  @xcite . combining the lowest - lying @xmath8 meson and baryon octets",
    ", one can form five meson - baryon elastic scattering processes that do not involve annihilation diagrams .",
    "three of these involve kaons and therefore are , in principle , amenable to an @xmath8 heavy - baryon @xmath7-pt ( hb@xmath7-pt ) analysis  @xcite for extrapolation .",
    "the remaining two processes involve pions interacting with hyperons and therefore can be analyzed in conjunction with the kaon processes in @xmath8 hb@xmath7-pt , or independently using @xmath9 hb@xmath7-pt .",
    "meson - baryon scattering has been developed to several non - trivial orders in the @xmath8 hb@xmath7-pt expansion in refs .",
    "@xcite , extending earlier work on kaon - nucleon scattering in ref .  @xcite . a very - recent paper  @xcite has reconsidered the @xmath8 hb@xmath7-pt results using a different regularization scheme , and also derived results for pion - hyperon scattering in the @xmath9 hb@xmath7-pt expansion .",
    "these works make clear that the paucity of experimental data make it is very difficult to assess the convergence of the chiral expansion in the three - flavor case .",
    "further , in the pion - hyperon system , the complete lack of experimental data precludes a separate analysis in the chiral two - flavor expansion . a lattice calculation of meson - baryon scattering analyzed using @xmath7-pt is therefore useful not only in making predictions for low - energy scattering at the physical point , but also for assessing the convergence of the chiral expansion for a range of quark masses at which present - day lattice calculations are being performed .",
    "meson - baryon scattering is also of interest for several indirect reasons .",
    "the @xmath10 interaction is important for the description of kaon condensation in the interior of neutron stars  @xcite , and meson - baryon interactions are essential input in determining the final - state interactions of various decays that are interesting for standard - model phenomenology ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an example ) .",
    "finally , in determining baryon excited states on the lattice , it is clear that the energy levels that represent meson - baryon scattering on the finite - volume lattice must be resolved before progress can be made regarding the extraction of single - particle excitations .",
    "the experimental input to existing @xmath7-pt analyses of meson - baryon scattering is extensively discussed in refs .",
    "threshold pion - nucleon scattering information is taken from experiments with pionic hydrogen and deuterium  @xcite , and the kaon - nucleon scattering lengths are taken from model - dependent extractions from kaon - nucleon scattering data  @xcite .",
    "there is essentially no experimental information available on the pion - hyperon and kaon - hyperon scattering lengths .",
    "there have been two quenched lattice qcd studies of meson - baryon scattering parameters : the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated pion - nucleon and kaon - nucleon scattering lengths at heavy pion masses without any serious attempt to extrapolate to the physical point , and ref .  @xcite calculated the @xmath11 @xmath12 scattering length and found a result consistent with the current algebra prediction .    in this work",
    "we calculate the lowest - lying energy levels for five meson - baryon processes that have no annihilation diagrams : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 in a mixed - action lattice qcd calculation with domain - wall valence quarks on the asqtad - improved coarse milc configurations with @xmath13 at four light - quark masses ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 mev ) , and at two light quark masses ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 mev ) on the fine milc configurations with @xmath20 , with substantially less statistics on the fine ensembles .",
    "we extract the s - wave scattering lengths from the two - particle energies , and analyze the five processes using @xmath8 hb@xmath7-pt .",
    "we find a rather conclusive lack of convergence in the three - flavor chiral expansion .",
    "we then consider @xmath0 and @xmath1 using @xmath9 hb@xmath7-pt and find that we are able to make reliable predictions of the scattering lengths at the physical point .",
    "we find @xmath21 where the errors encompass statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the leading order @xmath7-pt ( current algebra ) predictions for the scattering lengths are given by  @xcite : @xmath22    ultimately , either the chiral extrapolation should be performed after a continuum limit has been taken , or one should use the mixed - action extension of hb@xmath7-pt to perform the chiral extrapolations   @xcite .",
    "however , our results on the fine milc configurations are statistics - limited and not yet sufficiently accurate to make this a useful exercise .",
    "further , the explicit extrapolation formulas for the meson - baryon scattering lengths have not yet been determined in mixed - action @xmath7-pt . despite these limitations",
    ", we expect the corrections from finite lattice spacing to be small for two principle reasons .",
    "firstly , the meson - baryon scattering lengths are protected by chiral symmetry and therefore the ( approximate ) chiral symmetry of the domain wall valence fermions used in this work protects the scattering lengths from additive renormalization , which can be explicitly seen in the construction of the mixed - action baryon lagrangian in ref .",
    "the mixed - action corrections do not appear until next - to - next - to leading order in the chiral expansion of the meson - baryon scattering lengths .",
    "secondly , our previous experience with this mixed - action lattice qcd program leads us to expect that discretization effects will be well - encompassed within the overall errors we quote . in our precise calculation of meson - meson scattering , the predicted mixed - action corrections   @xcite were smaller than the uncertainties on a given ensemble  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mbsp ]",
    "we isolate the five meson - baryon processes with no annihilation diagrams that are calculated in this work .",
    "we briefly review the standard lscher method for extracting the scattering amplitude from two - particle energy levels in a finite volume in section  [ sec : finvol ] .",
    "particulars regarding the mixed - action lattice calculation and fitting methods are provided in section  [ sec : madetails ] .",
    "additional details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . mixing between two of the meson - baryon channels with the same quantum numbers",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec : mcham ] . in section  [ sec : su3ce ] we consider chiral extrapolations of the lattice data using @xmath8 hb@xmath7-pt , and in section  [ sec : su2ce ] we analyze the pion - hyperon lattice data using @xmath9 hb@xmath7-pt .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to construct the six scattering channels involving the lowest - lying octet mesons and baryons that do not have annihilation diagrams , and to determine their isospin .   and",
    "@xmath23 systems have the same quantum numbers , and therefore require a mixed channel analysis in order to extract the @xmath23 scattering length .",

    "given the poor convergence seen in the three - flavor chiral expansion due to the large loop corrections , it is natural to consider the two - flavor theory with the strange quark integrated out . in this way , @xmath25 and @xmath26 may be analyzed in an expansion in @xmath27 with no fear of corrections that scale as powers of @xmath28 .",
    "the detailed matching of lecs between the three- and two - flavor theories is described in detail in ref .",
    "we make use of the formulation of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 t - matrices from  @xcite to perform the two - flavor chiral extrapolations for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are two representations of the pion - hyperon scattering lengths that are equivalent up to omitted higher orders in the chiral expansion ; one contains a chiral logarithm , and the other is purely a polynomial in @xmath27 . using both forms provides a useful check on the systematics of the chiral extrapolation .",

    "an analysis of the scattering lengths of these two - body systems using hb@xmath7pt has led us to conclude that the three - flavor chiral expansion does not converge over the range of light quark masses that we investigate .",
    "while the kaon - baryon scattering lengths appear perturbative at nlo , a comparison of nnlo with nlo calls into question the convergence of the three - flavor chiral expansion .",
    "therefore , we do not quote values for the kaon - baryon scattering lengths at the physical point . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering lengths appear to have a well - controlled chiral expansion in two - flavor hb@xmath7pt .",
    "our results , @xmath5 fm , and @xmath6 fm , deviate from the lo ( current algebra ) predictions at the one- and two - sigma level , respectively .",
    "we look forward to confirmation of these predictions from other lattice qcd calculations and possibly from future experiments .",
    "the hb@xmath7pt analyses performed in this work support a general observation about convergence in the three - flavor chiral expansion , at least for the processes studied here . as the pion masses considered in this lattice calculation are comparable to the physical kaon mass , the distinct convergence patterns of the two- and three - flavor chiral expansions found in this work are suggestive that the breakdown in the three - flavor case is not due to the relative largeness of the strange - quark mass as compared to the light quark masses , but rather due to some other enhancement in the coefficients of the loop contributions , possibly related to a scaling with powers of @xmath65 , the number of flavors .",
    "while in this paper we have not considered the lowest - lying baryon decuplet , one interesting process for future study is the @xmath66 system .",
    "it does not involve disconnected diagrams since the pions have no valence quarks with the same flavor as the @xmath67 constituents .",
