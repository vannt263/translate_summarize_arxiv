    "asteroid dynamical families are groups of asteroids in orbital element space ( gradie , chapman & williams 1979 , gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 , valsecchi _ et al .",
    "this clustering was first discovered by hirayama ( 1918 , for a review see binzel 1993 ) , who also proposed that families may be the remnants of parent bodies that broke into fragments .",
    "about half of all known asteroids are believed to belong to families ; recent work ( zappal _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , hereafter z95 ) , applying a hierarchical clustering method to a sample of 12,487 asteroids , finds over 30 families .",
    "the contrast between families and the background is especially strong in the space spanned by the so - called _ proper _ orbital elements .",
    "these elements are nearly invariants of motion and are thus well suited for discovering objects with common dynamical history ( valsecchi _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 , milani & kneevi 1992 , hereafter mk92 ) .",
    "the current asteroid motion is described by _ osculating _",
    "orbital elements which vary with time due to perturbations caused by planets , and are less suitable for studying dynamical families .",
    "asteroid clustering is much weaker in the space spanned by directly observed osculating elements than in the space spanned by derived proper elements .",
    "figure 1 compares the osculating ( top panel , bowell 2001 ) and proper ( bottom panel , mk92 ) orbital inclination vs. orbital eccentricity distributions of 1,720 asteroids from the outer region of the main asteroid belt ( proper semi - major axis larger than 2.84 au ) .",
    "this region contains all three major asteroid families : eos , koronis and themis , with approximate ( @xmath3 ) of ( 3.0 , 0.18 , 0.08 ) , ( 2.9 , 0.03 , 0.05 ) and ( 3.15,0.02 , 0.15 ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath4 is proper semi - major axis , @xmath5 is the sine of the orbital inclination angle , and @xmath6 is eccentricity .",
    "the proper elements are derived from the osculating elements by an approximate perturbation method ( mk92 ) , and it is possible that the overdensities evident in the bottom panel are at least partially created by that algorithm ( valsecchi _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 , bendjoya 1993 ) . a firm proof that families are real therefore requires their confirmation by a method that is _ not _ based on dynamical considerations , for example , that dynamically selected groups have distinctive colors . while there is observational evidence that at least the most populous asteroid families have characteristic colors ( degewij , gradie & zellner 1978 , chapman 1989 ) , even the most recent studies of the colors of asteroid families include fewer than 50 objects per family ( florczak _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , doressoundiram _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , florczak _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . the large number ( about 10,000 ) of color measurements for catalogued asteroids ( bowell 2001 ) recently made available by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) allows a detailed investigation of this question .",
    "the sdss is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey which will cover one quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap and produce a smaller but much deeper multi - epoch survey in the southern galactic hemisphere ( stoughton _ et al .",
    "the survey sky coverage will result in photometric measurements ( smith _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , hogg _",
    "2002 ) for about 50 million stars and a similar number of galaxies , and spectra for about 1 million galaxies and 100,000 quasars .",
    "although primarily designed for observations of extragalactic objects , the sdss is significantly contributing to studies of solar system objects , because asteroids in the imaging survey must be explicitly recognized to avoid contamination of the quasar samples selected for spectroscopic observations ( lupton _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . the sdss will increase the number of asteroids with accurate five - color photometry ( fukugita _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , gunn _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) by more than two orders of magnitude ( to about 100,000 ) , and to a limit more than five magnitudes fainter than previous multi - color surveys ( ivezi _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , hereafter i01 ) .",
    "most of the asteroids observed by the sdss are new detections , because the sdss finds moving objects to a fainter limit ( @xmath7 ) than the completeness limit of currently available asteroid catalogs ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , sdss observations , which are obtained with a baseline of only 5 minutes ( lupton _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , i01 ) , are insufficient to determine accurate orbits , and we consider only objects that have previously determined orbital parameters .",
    "the details of the matching procedure and a preliminary sample are described by juri _",
    "_ 2002 ( hereafter j02 ) .",
    "here we extend their analysis to a significantly larger sample , and introduce a new method for visualizing the distribution of asteroids in a multi - dimensional space spanned by orbital parameters and colors .",
    "the currently available sdss moving object list ( ivezi _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , hereafter sdssmoc ) includes over 58,000 observations ; 10,592 are detections of unique objects listed in the catalog of known asteroids ( bowell 2001 ) , and 2,010 detections are multiple observations of the same objects . for a subset of 6,612 objects from this list ,",
    "the proper orbital elements are also available ( mk92 ) and are analyzed here .",
    "these samples are about an order of magnitude larger than used in previous studies of the colors of asteroids , and also benefit from the wide wavelength range spanned by sdss filters band extends to the near - infrared range and allows efficient recognition of vesta type asteroids ( binzel & xu 1995 ) . ]",
    "( gunn _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "sdss colors can distinguish asteroids of at least three different color types ( i01 , j02 ) . using four of the five sdss bands ,",
    "we construct the color - color diagram shown in figure 2 .",
    "the horizontal axis color . ] is and the vertical axis is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 are the asteroid colors measured by sdss ( accurate to about 0.03 mag ) .",
    "each dot represents one asteroid , and is color - coded according to its position in this diagram ( note that these colors do not correspond directly to asteroid colors as would be seen by the human eye ) . as discussed by i01 ,",
    "the asteroid distribution in this diagram is highly bimodal , with over 90% of objects found in one of the two clumps that are dominated by rocky s type asteroids ( @xmath12 ) , and carbonaceous c type asteroids ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "most of the remaining objects have @xmath14 color similar to s type asteroids , and distinctively blue @xmath9 colors .",
    "they are dominated by vesta type asteroids ( binzel & xu 1995 , j02 ) .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show two two - dimensional projections of the asteroid distribution in the space spanned by proper semi - major axis , eccentricity , and the sine of the orbital inclination angle , with the points color - coded as in figure 2 .",
    "the vertical bands where practically no asteroids are found ( at @xmath4 of 2.065 , 2.501 , 2.825 and 3.278 au ) are the 4:1 , 3:1 , 5:2 , and 2:1 mean motion resonances with jupiter ( the latter three are the kirkwood gaps ) .",
    "figure  5 is analogous to the bottom panel in figure  1 .",
    "a striking feature of figures 3 , 4 and 5 is the color homogeneity and distinctiveness displayed by asteroid families .",
    "each of the three major hirayama families , eos , koronis and themis , and also the vesta family at ( @xmath3 ) of ( 2.35 , 0.12 , 0.09 ) , has a characteristic color .",
    "this strong color segregation provides firm support for the reality of asteroid dynamical families .",
    "the correlation between the asteroid colors and their heliocentric distance has been recognized since the earliest development of asteroid taxonomies ( chapman , morrison & zellner 1975 , gradie & tedesco 1982 , zellner , tholen & tedesco 1985 , gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that this mean correlation ( see e.g. figure 23 in i01 ) is mostly a reflection of the distinctive colors of asteroid families and their heliocentric distribution .",
    "when only orbital elements are considered , families often partially overlap each other ( z95 ) , and additional independent information is needed to improve their definitions . with such a massive , accurate and public database as that discussed here ( sdssmoc ) , it will be possible to improve the classification of asteroid families by simultaneously using both the orbital elements and colors .",
    "for example , the sdss colors show that the asteroids with ( @xmath15 ) about ( 2.65 , 0.20 ) are distinctively blue ( figure 3 ) , proving that they do not belong to the family with ( @xmath15 ) about ( 2.60 , 0.23 ) , but instead are a family in their own right .",
    "while this and several similar examples were already recognized as clusters in the orbital parameter space ( z95 ) , this work provides a dramatic independent confirmation .",
    "figures 3 , 4 and 5 suggest that the asteroid population is dominated by families : even objects that do not belong to the most populous families , and thus are interpreted as background in dynamical studies , seem to show color clustering . using the definitions of families based on dynamical analysis ( z95 ) , and aided by sdss colors ,",
    "we estimate that at least 90% of asteroids are associated with families .    proper orbital elements ( mk92 ) are not available for asteroids with large semi - major axis and orbital inclination .",
    "in order to examine the color distribution for objects with large semi - major axis , such as trojan asteroids ( @xmath16 ) and for objects with large inclination , such as asteroids from the hungaria family ( @xmath17 ) , we use osculating orbital elements .",
    "figure 6 shows the distribution of all the 10,592 known asteroids observed by the sdss in the space spanned by osculating semi - major axis and the sine of the orbital inclination angle , with the points color - coded as in figure 2 .",
    "it is remarkable that various families can still be easily recognized due to sdss color information .",
    "this figure vividly demonstrates that the asteroid population is dominated by objects that belong to numerous asteroid families .",
    "we are grateful to e. bowell for making his astorb file publicly available , and to a. milani , z. kneevi and their collaborators for generating and distributing proper orbital elements .",
    "we thank princeton university for generous financial support of this research , and m. strauss and d. schneider for helpful comments .",
