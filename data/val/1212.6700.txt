    "the lack of compact massive galaxies at low redshift implies significant size evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath15 ( trujillo et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "two popular models for the size evolution have been proposed : ( 1 ) dissipationless ( dry ) minor merger ( naab et al .",

    "2010 ) ; ( 2 ) `` puff - up '' due to the gas mass loss by agn ( fan et al . 2008 , 2010 ) or supernova feedback ( damjanov et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , recent studies found that observed size evolution of the compact massive galaxies at redshift @xmath16 can not be explained well by the present models .",
    "nipoti et al ( 2012 ) constructed a @xmath17cdm - based analytic framework , supported by suites of n - body merger simulations , to predict the evolution of etgs undergoing dry mergers . using a compilation of observations of etgs at @xmath18",

    "ragone - figueroa & granato ( 2011 ) found the mass loss by agn feedback can produce a significant size increase based on the results of numerical simulations .",
    "however , they augued most of the puffing up occurs when the stellar population are much younger than the estimated ages of compact high - z pegs , so that the puffing up due to the gas mass loss may not dominate the size evolution observed so far .",

    ". the large diversity of @xmath20 may be due to the different sample selection criteria ( morphological , color - color or ssfr selections ) and/or partly due to the sparsity of data points at high redshift .",
    "for instance , there are only about ten objects at @xmath23 in damjanov et al . 2012 . using @xmath24 and ssfr selection criteria , szomoru et al .",
    "( 2012 ) selected 21 pegs at @xmath2 in the goods - south field as part of the candels survey .",

    "however , other results with steeper slope had been found from different samples . using optical and near - infrared photometry in the ukirt ultra deep survey and goods - south fields of the candels survey , newman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found the size evolution of quiescent galaxies with redshift could be described as @xmath63 .",

    "damjanov et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found an even steeper value , @xmath66 .",
    "the sizes need to increase by a factor of @xmath67 for @xmath68 from @xmath69 to 0 . while for @xmath70",
    ", the sizes would increase by a factor of @xmath71 during the same comic epoch .",
    "the diversity of observed size evolution with redshift is at least partly due to the sparsity of data points at @xmath2 .",

    "the error bars show the @xmath73 scatter .",
    "the dashed line represents the size evolution with redshift described by @xmath74 .",
    "the other symbols are the same as those in figure 3 . ]",
    "a relevant feature of the data for massive pegs at high redshift is the quite large scatter of the size , as is apparent from figures 3 and 4 .",
    "we plot the @xmath75 size scatter ( @xmath76 ) of two redshift bins in figure 4 .",
    "we find that the size scatter is large at @xmath1 in the combined data .",
    "the values of @xmath76 are 0.22 and 0.34 at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "newman et al . ( 2012 ) showed a very similar result:@xmath77 0.24 and 0.26 at @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively.in figure 4 , the error bars show 1@xmath5 size scatter of two redshift bins and the shaded area reflects the distribution of local sdss galaxies .",
    "compared to the small size scatter of sdss etgs ( @xmath80 at @xmath81 ) , the size scatter also needs a significant evolution with redshift ( about a factor of @xmath82 from @xmath2 ) .",
    "larger size scatter at higher redshift need to be accounted for by galaxy evolution models .",
    "if the observed size evolution with redshift is dominated by the dry minor merger , we will expect that more compact pegs have higher dry merger rates relative to less compact objects at given redshift range .",
    "another possibility is size evolution at @xmath83 could be dominated by agn feedback .",
    "one assumption is that gas will be removed by the strong agn feedback in a short timescale . in this case ,",
    "galaxy structure after agn feedback will relax to the new equilibrium .",
    "another situation for agn feedback mechanism is that the gas removal will not complete in only one single shot .",
    "martizzi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used cosmological simulations to show the effect of agn feedback on the gas distribution in the central regions of cluster galaxies .",
    "they found gas heated and expelled by agn feedback can return after cooling ; repeated cycles could modify the stars and dark matter mass profile . during the cycles",
    ", the observed sizes will oscillate from compact ( all gas is located within the central regions of galaxies ) to normal ( gas is expelled from the galaxy center ) .",
    "this produces the large size scatter observed at high redshift , and the size scatter will be related to agn activities which decrease from @xmath2 to @xmath84 . for agn feedback mechanism , larger gas fraction at higher redshift will also be needed in order to explain the observed size scatter evolution .",
    "most recently , olsen et al . (",
    "2012 ) found the ubiquitous presence of agn in massive , quiescent @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "this result provided observational indications for the important role agn played in explaining the size ( and size scatter ) evolution .",
    "it should be noticed that the lensing magnification correction that we adopted is simple , which may introduce uncertainties as well .",
    "however , the uncertainty on the lensing magnification may not significantly alter our main results above .",
    "the corrected stellar mass is proportional to @xmath85 , while the corrected effective radius is proportional to @xmath86 . as @xmath42 decreases / increases , the location on the size - mass plane will move along the directions shown by arrows in figure 3 .",
    "the arrows ( @xmath87 ) nearly parallel to the local size - mass relation ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "so the uncertainty of @xmath42 will have a small effect on the mass - normalized effective radius .",
    "for instance , the mass - normalized effective radius with @xmath89 will only change by a factor of @xmath90 when @xmath42 increases by a factor of two .",
    "in this letter , we use the clash survey data to select a massive , lensed pegs sample at @xmath1 , based on the sed - fitting ssfr and accurate photometric redshift .",
    "we deduce the optical rest - frame effective radius of these high redshift objects using galfit .",
    "combined with literature data , we find the size evolution of passively evolving galaxies scales with redshift as @xmath91 .",
    "we confirm that their sizes have a large spread .",
    "the 1-@xmath5 scatter @xmath92 of the size distribution is 0.22 and 0.34 at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which is about 1.4 and 2.1 times larger than the local value ( @xmath93 ) , respectively .",
    "the observed large size scatter has to be carefully taken into account in galaxy evolution model predictions .",

    "<S> we also deduce the optical rest - frame effective radius of these high redshift objects . </S>",
    "<S> the derived stellar masses and measured effective radii have been corrected by the lensing magnification factors , which are estimated by simply adopting the spherical nfw model for the foreground cluster lens . </S>",
    "<S> the observed near - ir images , obtained by hst wfc3 camera with high spatial resolution and lensed by the foreground clusters , enable us to study the structures of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> nine out of ten galaxies have on average three times smaller effective radius than local etgs of similar stellar masses , in agreement with previous works at redshift @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with literature data for @xmath2 , we find that the mass - normalized effective radius scales with redshift as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that their size distribution shows a large scatter : from normal size to @xmath4 times smaller compared to local etgs with similar stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> the 1-@xmath5 scatter @xmath6 of the size distribution is 0.22 and 0.34 at @xmath7 and @xmath8,respectively.the observed large size scatter has to be carefully taken into account in galaxy evolution model predictions .
