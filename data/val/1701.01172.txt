    "ghz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources are defined by a spectral turnover at ghz frequencies @xcite .",
    "this class has been reported to represent at least 10% of the bright radio source population @xcite although the more recent study by mingaliev et al .",
    "find that only 1@xmath22% of a sample of @xmath25000 sources with @xmath3200mjy met their criteria for classification as a gps source .",
    "the catalog of labiano et al .",
    "contains 172 gps sources , of which 156 have a flux density ( generally , though not exclusively , at 5 ghz ) above 200mjy .",
    "the class of gps sources contains , amongst others , three distinct sub - classes : ( i ) radio galaxies , at low redshift , ( ii ) quasars at relatively high redshift , ( iii ) flaring active galactic nuclei which temporarily have a peaked spectrum during the spectral evolution of an outburst .",
    "mingaliev et al .",
    "found a quarter of their sample consisted of blazars with spectra that may temporarily had a convex shape while the object was in an active state ( see also lister 2003 ; kovalev 2005 ; torniainen et al .",
    "2008 ) . while all these meet the basic definition of a gps source , we consider `` temporary '' gps sources to be a separate class from `` bona fide '' or persistent gps sources , and focus our interest on these .",
    "in addition to the spectral criterion , all three sub - classes of gps sources above are characterised by compact sub - kpc  scale radio structure .",
    "bona fide gps sources are further characterised by low radio polarisation , and low variability at radio wavelengths .",
    "an observed anti - correlation between turnover frequency and projected linear size @xcite has led to a model in which gps sources evolve into compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources , which are typically less than 20kpc in projected linear size , and possibly then into fr - i and/or fr - ii sources @xcite .",
    "the identification of the gps source pks 2000@xmath0330 with a @xmath43.77 quasar by peterson et al .",
    " at the time most distant source known  led odea to consider the prevalence of gps quasars at high redshift .",
    "although the population of known @xmath13 sources at the time was not large , odea found that about half of the known @xmath13 quasars were gps sources and additionally that about half of the then known gps quasars lay in this redshift range .",
    "more recently , coppejans et al .   identified a sample of 33 megahertz peaked - spectrum ( mps ) sources and determined redshifts for 24 , with an average redshift of 1.3 .",
    "five of the sources had @xmath12 , with four fainter sources for which redshifts could not be found , thought to be at even higher redshifts , suggesting that the mps sources are also good candidates for high - redshift sources .",
    "in contrast , however , mingaliev et al .",
    "reported that there was a deficit of objects at large redshifts with peak frequencies below several ghz .",
    "early studies of the parsec - scale morphology of gps source found that many could be characterised as a `` compact double '' , with two components of comparable flux density separated by up to some tens of milliarcseconds .",
    "stanghellini concluded that gps quasars tend to have core - jet or complex morphologies whereas gps galaxies were more likely to be compact symmetric objects ( cso ) .",
    "data from a multi - frequency , multi - epoch atca survey @xcite was used to search for new gps sources @xcite .",
    "the survey , which was made in conjunction with the vsop survey program @xcite , originally contained 212 sources , however 17 of these were dropped after the first few epochs as it was clear they did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the vsop survey .",
    "the remaining 185 sources were observed at up to 16 epochs between 1996 and 2000 at 1.4 , 2.5 , 4.8 and 8.6ghz .",
    "the multi - epoch observations allowed determination of the variability index , @xmath5 , defined as the r.m.s .  variation from the mean flux density , divided by the mean flux density .",
    "examination of these data resulted in the identification of 9 new southern hemisphere gps candidates @xcite . in this paper",
    "we combine new lba observations at 4.8ghz of the four southernmost gps candidates with published images of the other 5 sources to study the parsec - scale morphologies and the sizes of the compact components in these candidate gps sources , and consider the implications for the sub - categories of gps sources listed above .",
    "in particular , we examine the correlation between narrow spectral width and compact double morphology suggested by edwards & tingay , and the morphology of the high redshift ( @xmath13 ) sub - class of gps sources for insights into the nature of these sources .",
    "we list in table  [ tab1 ] the source classification and redshift , and the 4.8ghz mean flux density , @xmath6 , mean fractional polarization , @xmath7 , and variability index , @xmath8 , from tingay et al .  .",
    "the width is the fwhm of the fitted spectrum in decades of frequency ( see edwards & tingay 2004 for details ) .    the mean variability index at 5ghz for the 185 sources ranged between 0.01 and 0.43 , with a median value of 0.08 ( see tingay et al .",
    "2003a for tabulated values and distributions ) .",
    "the highest observed linear polarisation was 8.19% at 5ghz , with a median level of 2.2% .",
    "twenty - four sources ( 13% of the total ) had polarisation levels below the reliably measurable level of 0.5% .",
    "the nine new gps candidates identified by edwards & tingay showed the expected low variability and low fractional polarization characteristic of the class .    here",
    "we describe lba observations of the four southernmost sources : pks 1619@xmath0680 ( j1624@xmath06809 ) , mrc 1722@xmath0644 ( j1726@xmath06427 ) , pks 1831@xmath0711 ( j1837@xmath07108 ) , and pks 2146@xmath0783 ( j2152@xmath07807 ) .",
    "the other five candidates from edwards & tingay have declinations north of @xmath9 and the results of very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of these sources have been reported previously .",
    "four of the five were observed at 5ghz as part of the vsop pre - launch survey ( vlbapls : fomalont et al .",
    "2000 ) , a companion program to the atca program to derive the final source list for the vsop agn survey @xcite , and the fifth source was studied by tingay & edwards .",

    "the array of telescopes consisted of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) ( 5x22 m ) , mopra ( 22 m ) , parkes ( 64 m ) , hobart ( 26 m ) , and ceduna ( 30 m ) .",

    "b0429@xmath0388 is the only source for which there is not a published vlbi image ( and we note that while the spectrum is curved it has yet to be firmly established that it is in fact peaked ) .",
    "we tabulate the approximate largest angular size of the parsec - scale image , noting that the vlbi images span a range of sensitivities due to both the epoch the observations were made ( more recent observations are generally made with wider bandwidths ) and the observing mode ( some are snapshots , others are dedicated observations ) .",
    "we do not give a las for b1422 + 231 as it is gravitational lensed and the lensed images are subject to a range of amplifications in flux density and scale , though none of the images is larger than several mas in extent @xcite .",
    "only two of the sources are unresolved , and several extend over more than 10mas .",
    "the resolved sources all appear to have a core - jet morphology : orienti et al .   proposed b1614 + 051 as a candidate cso source , however comparison with the subsequent observation of pushkarev and kovalev lead us to tentatively favour a core - jet morphology .",
    "this predominance of core - jet morphologies is in accord with previous reports that quasars are more likely to have core - jet or complex structures @xcite .",
    "we note that the sources in table  [ tab3 ] are compiled from several sources and are subject to their respective selection biases , and reiterate that the vlbi morphologies are based on a heterogeneous set of vlbi observations .",
    "nevertheless , the predominance of cj morphologies , and absence of cd or cso morphologies , is striking and deserves a more systematic follow - up .",
    "edwards & tingay observed that the spectrum of mrc 1722@xmath0644 has a width comparable to the ( narrow ) spectra of the compact double pks 1934@xmath0638 @xcite and the compact symmetric object 0108 + 388 @xcite which led them to predict that mrc 1722@xmath0644 might also display a compact double morphology , which is borne out by our lba observations .",
    "further examples can be found in the sample of dallacasa et al .",
    ": 1518 + 047 and 1607 + 268 are compact doubles with separations of 150 and 60mas respectively , and both have spectral widths of @xmath21.1 decades of frequency .",
    "more recently , callingham et al .   reported that the gps source pks b0008@xmath0421 has the smallest known spectral width of any gps source , and the steepest known spectral slope below the turnover , close to the theoretical limit of synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the vlbi - scale morphology has two components separated by @xmath2120mas .",
    "simplistically , such a correlation seems reasonable : if compact double sources are comprised of two lobes , with the central component either heavily absorbed ( at these frequencies ) or in a quiescent state , it would be quite natural for the superposition of the spectra of the two components to be narrower than the case where an additional , generally flatter spectrum , core component also contributes to the total source spectrum .",
    "however , inspection of other compact double sources indicates that any such correlation is not tight : taylor & peck found pks 2344@xmath0192 ( j2347@xmath01856 ) to be a compact double with a separation of @xmath232 mas , but the source has yet to be established as a gps source ( while the spectrum is curved , it is not clear it is peaked ) . similarly , taylor et al",
    ".   found 1031 + 567 to be a compact double with a separation of @xmath234 mas .",
    "while archival data indicates it has a peaked spectrum , the width is @xmath21.5 decades of frequency , appreciably broader than the examples above .",
    "generally , however , sources with cd or cso morphologies must either be viewed close to side - on , or possess jets where doppler boosting does not play a significant role , if we are indeed seeing two lobes of similar brightness .",
    "strong absorption of the core suggests we are viewing the source side - on , with the absoption in a disc or torus of material surrounding the core .",
    "in contrast , in core - jet sources  assuming jets are intriscially two - sided  we are seeing the doppler boosted jet oriented towards us and not seeing the doppler de - boosted jet travelling in the opposite direction ( although again , absorption could play a role close to the core ) .",
    "variability is a common feature of core - jet sources , amplified by doppler boosting , and so one might expect core - jet sources generally to be more variable , and therefore for the spectra of core - jet sources to evolve away from having gps spectra more quickly than their cso or cd counterparts . compact double sources might then be expected to be less ( or more slowly ) variable , as is the case for 1031 + 567 @xcite and pks 1934@xmath0638 , the primary flux density calibrator for the atca @xcite .",
    "mrc 1722@xmath0644 , which we classify as a cd , has the lowest variability index of the nine candidates ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we have established that one of the candidate gps sources examined shows evidence for sufficient variability to exclude it as a bona fide gps source . the other sources remain good candidates for inclusion in gps catalogues .",
    "multi - epoch , and multi - frequency , vlbi observations in the future would enable the morphologies of the sources to be established more firmly , particular in discriminating between core - jet sources and compact double sources .",
    "on - going montoring to establish the persistence ( or otherwise ) of the peaked spectra is another approach , the utility of which has been demonstrated for pks 1718@xmath0649 by tingay et al .  .",
    "in addition , results at lower frequencies from the mwa gleam survey ( wayth et al .  2015 ; hurley - walker et al .  in preparation ) and the australian ska pathfinder @xcite will extend the frequency range over which the spectra can be determined and monitored .",
    "we have presented the first parsec - scale images of four candidate southern gps sources and considered these alongside published vlbi images of the five other candidate gps sources from edwards & tingay .",
    "we find core - jet or compact double morphologies dominate , with further observations required to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "the sole compact symmetric object , pks 2254@xmath0367 , is a nearby galaxy .",
    "one of the nine candidates , pks 1831@xmath0711 , displays appreciable variability , suggesting its gps spectrum is more ephemeral in nature . although the sample is small , there is some evidence that core - jet sources are more polarised and more variable , and that compact doubles are the least variable .",
    "mrc 1722@xmath0644 , which has the narrowest spectral width of the sample , has a compact double morphology , and while there are other examples of such a correlation it is not universal .",
    "two of our sample have been found to lie among the highest redshift gps sources known .",
    "an examination of the vlbi morphologies of the 15 catalogued high - redshift ( @xmath13 ) sub - class of gps sources suggests that core - jet morphologies predominate in this class , with more systematic follow - up of this apparent trend encouraged .",
    "the anonymous referee is thanked for suggestions which have improved the paper .",
    "the long baseline array is part of the australia telescope national facility which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system , and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "we thank dave jauncey , john reynolds , tasso tzioumis and jim lovell in particular for their efforts in operating and maintaining the lba at the time these observations were made ."
