    "their fluxes are 2.4 and 4.6 mjy respectively ( stocke et al . 1991 ) .",

    "they find a hardness ratio that corresponds to a power - law energy index of 0.52 .",
    "unfortunately the very low exposure ( @xmath24 s ) does not allow a detailed fit to the spectral data .    here , we discuss long exposure ( @xmath25 ksec ) pointed pspc and high resolution imager ( hri ) observations of these galaxies in an attempt to constrain the origin of the powerful x - ray emission , and to investigate possible links between these and the luminous galaxies detected in deep  surveys .",

    "these data were retrieved from the university of leicester ledas  public archive .",
    "data from two  hri pointed observations are used , firstly an on - axis observation of ms1019 + 5139 ( ror rh600125 ) with an exposure of 10924 s , taken between 26th october 1991 and 18th july 1992 and an observation of  obtained on 18th may 1995 with an exposure of 11360 s ( ror rh701844 ) .",
    "in fig . 1 we present the radial count distribution for ms1019 + 5139 from the hri observation .",
    "data were binned into 1 arcsec bins , out to , and including , a radius of 18 arcsec , the radius which encloses @xmath38 per cent of the source photons . to determine an upper limit to the angular size of the object , we modelled the data as a simple gaussian distribution of variable sigma .",
    "an upper limit to the gaussian @xmath39 is found , at the 99 per cent confidence level , to be 3.45  , corresponding to a linear distance , at the redshift of the object ( @xmath17 ) , of 12.8 kpc . for comparison ,",
    "the radial count distribution of an on - axis hri observation of ar lac ( a point source used in calibrating the  hri ) is plotted as a solid line .",

    "it can be seen there is no evidence for short - term variability , however , comparison of the pspc flux ( @xmath41 ) with the hri fluxes ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and the  all - sky survey flux from perlman et al .",
    "( 1996a ) ( @xmath44 ) suggests variability on the long - term ( year ) timescale .",
    "the above fluxes refer to the 0.1 - 2.0 kev band , and were estimated using the best fit power - law model described below .",
    "a  test rejects the null hypothesis of no long - term variability at the 99.99 per cent confidence level .",
    "we note that the observed variability can not be due to uncertainties or variations in the calibration of the pspc and the hri .",
    "hasinger et al .",
    "( 1993 ) present the results of a long term program of calibration observations with the pspc , concluding that over a 3 year period , the count rate of the supernova remnant n132d measured in the pspc was constant within 2 per cent .",
    "similar work using the hri ( david et al .",
    "1996 ) finds that the observed count rate of n132d to vary by @xmath45 per cent over the period 1990 - 1995 .",
    "we also note that there is an excellent agreement ( better than 1 per cent ) between the hri and pspc flux calibration .",
    "this is derived by comparing the pspc and hri flux of the galaxy cluster a2256 ( david et al .",
    "1996 ) , where the count rates are converted to flux using the x - ray spectrum from markevitch & vikhlinin ( 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , the count rate of ms1019 + 5139 in the hri increases by 70 per cent in @xmath46 months and a comparison of the two pspc fluxes shows a 40 per cent decrease between the all - sky survey and the pointed observation .",
    "we choose not to include in our analysis the _ einstein _",
    "ipc measurement obtained about 10 years earlier , due to differences in the calibration of the responses of the two satellites ( fiore et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "spectral fits were made with the simplest possible models : a power law and a raymond - smith hot plasma model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) , both with an absorption component included , having the column density either fixed to the galactic value , or as a free parameter .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "we see that the power law model provides a marginally better fit compared to the plasma model , albeit not statistically significant .",
    "the value for the f - statistic is 0.818 , implying that a power - law model gives a better fit only at the @xmath47 per cent level .",
    "the derived value for the hydrogen column is @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , somewhat above , but within the 90 per cent errors of the galactic @xmath50 value from stark et al .",
    "( 1992 ) of @xmath51 .",
    "the photon index is consistent , within @xmath52 errors , with the photon index from perlman et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , of @xmath53 . the folded spectrum for the best fit power law model , along with the residuals , is given in fig .",
    "we find that the best fit temperature of the raymond - smith model is @xmath54 kev using the galactic absorption column density and the heavy element abundance fixed at 0.3 solar units .",
    "allowing the heavy element abundance to be a free parameter , we find a best - fit value of 0.0 solar units , the 90 per cent upper limit being 0.2 solar units .",
    "the derived temperature is not significantly changed .      the observed radial count distribution from the hri data is given in fig .",
    "4 , together with the radial count distribution found from an on - axis observation of ar lac .",
    "comparison of the  data with the ar lac data gives a  value of 0.8 for 17 degrees of freedom , clearly showing that our object is a point source . using a similar method to determine the radial extension as for ms1019 + 5139 , we found an upper limit of @xmath55 , giving a value for the 99 per cent upper limit to the linear size of the object of 49.5 kpc .",
    "like ms1019 + 5139 , this source is seen to vary on year timescales , ( fig .",
    "5 ) , evidenced by the fluxes found , in the 0.1 - 2.0 kev band , from the pointed pspc observation , the serendipitous observation and the hri data , which are @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the conversion from count - rate to flux was performed using the best - fit thermal model , described below .",
    "no significant variation in flux is seen throughout the duration of each individual observation .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using first a power law model and then a raymond - smith plasma model .",
    "the results are presented in table 2 , and fig .",
    "6 shows the folded spectrum with the best fitting plasma model .",
    "both models give acceptable fits when the column density is a free parameter , although the plasma model does not statistically require an absorption column greater than the galactic value of @xmath57 , ( stark et al .",
    "however , we find the column density derived for the power - law model is substantially higher ( @xmath58 ) than the observed galactic value , and this excess above the stark et al .",
    "value is significant at over the 90 per cent level .",
    "the corresponding photon index is @xmath59 .",
    "when we fix the @xmath50 value to the stark et al .",
    "value we obtain a value of @xmath60 for the power - law index .",
    "the best fit temperature found with the plasma model with fixed column density and the heavy element abundance fixed at 0.3 solar units is 1.8 kev .",
    "the heavy element abundance is not well constrained : the best - fit value is 0.56 solar units with an upper and lower limit of 1.8 and 0.2 solar respectively at the 90 per cent confidence level .",
    "the detection of variability in the  observations immediately discriminates against a thermal origin for the radiation , ruling out emission from hot diffuse gas in an early - type galaxy or a group of galaxies . a hot intergalactic gas origin",
    "is further ruled out by the lack of spatial extension in the hri observations which limits the size of the source to @xmath61 kpc .",
    "hence , the x - ray data favour an agn interpretation .",
    "the absence of strong emission lines in the optical spectrum ( weak [ oii ] and @xmath62 + [ nii ] only are present ) argues against a qso or seyfert source and could suggest possibly a galaxy similar to those found in deep  surveys , or alternatively a bl lac object .",
    "we note however that , the x - ray luminosity of  ( @xmath63 ) is around an order of magnitude brighter than the galaxies found in deep  surveys .",
    "perlman et al . (",
    "1996a ) first suggested a bl lac identification based mainly on the optical spectra and the lack of spatial extension in x - rays .",
    "however , they noted that the equivalent widths of the emission lines are larger than those of x - ray selected bl lacs .",
    "we further note that the x - ray spectrum derived here is well represented by a power - law with @xmath64 , much flatter than the canonical x - ray selected bl lac spectrum of @xmath65 ( padovani & giommi 1996 )",
    ". the detection of  in radio wavelengths adds support to a bl lac scenario , as most x - ray selected bl lacs show strong radio emission ( perlman et al .",
    "indeed , with values of 1.06 and 0.25 for @xmath66 respectively ( stocke et al . 1991 ) , the location of this object on the @xmath67 plane ( optical to x - ray vs. radio to optical spectral index ) is very close to the x - ray selected bl lac region , approximately delimited by the values @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "6 of stocke et al .",
    "we emphasize however that the x - ray data alone can not provide a definitive identification for this object .",
    "further polarization and radio observations are necessary to prove that   is a bl lac object .",
    "the lack of x - ray extension strongly argues against thermal emission from intergalactic gas in a group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "the size of   is @xmath6950 kpc at the 99 per cent confidence level , compared to @xmath3260 kpc for the cluster 0055 - 279 ( roche et al .",
    "1995 ) , which is at similar distance ( z=0.561 ) and has a comparable luminosity , @xmath70 @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , ms1209 + 3917 does not show any evidence for a cluster on deep ccd images in clear contrast with the 0055 - 279 case . thermal emission from a compact group of galaxies is unlikely as the x - ray luminosity of ms1209 + 3917 is that of rich clusters of galaxies , while typical group luminosities are @xmath71 @xmath13 ( e.g. ebeling , voges , bhringer 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , the strongest argument against thermal emission comes from the detection of long - term ( year timescale ) variability between the pspc and the hri observation .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of  is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of the most luminous nearby , optical galaxies observed by _ einstein _ ( fabbiano 1989 ) and about an order of magnitude higher than the galaxies detected in deep   surveys ( griffiths et al .",
    "1995 , moran et al .",
    "all the above strongly suggest the presence of an active nucleus . the optical spectrum , which is unfortunately unpublished yet , holds important clues on the nature of this object .",
    "the absence of emission lines makes a bl lac intepretation a strong possibility . the x - ray spectrum power - law photon index ( @xmath72 )",
    "is similar to the average 0.1 - 2.0 kev photon index of x - ray selected bl lacs ( @xmath73 ) ( padovani & giommi 1996 ) .",
    "we observe significant absorption ( @xmath74 ) above the galactic value of @xmath75 ; such an excess absorption is not atypical in bl lacs ( urry et al .",
    "the bl lac hypothesis is further supported by the broad band spectral indices ( @xmath76 ) , which place  well within the x - ray selected bl lac region on the @xmath67 plane .",
    "we have presented the results of  observations of two x - ray highly luminous galaxies ( ms1019 + 5139 and ms1209 + 3917 ) from the emss , previously classified as cooling flow galaxies , in an attempt to constrain the origin of the powerful x - ray emission .",
    "the hri observations suggest that neither of the two objects shows evidence of spatial extension .",
    "the pspc spectra are consistent with a power - law model , although a bremsstrahlung model can not be strongly ruled out .",
    "finally , long - time variability is clearly detected between the pspc and hri observations in both objects .",
    "the above together with the high x - ray luminosities of these objects strongly rule out a thermal emission model from a normal galaxy or a cluster of galaxies and clearly support an agn interpretation .",
    "the possibility that there is some connection to the non - qso faint sources detected in deep rosat surveys ( e.g. boyle et al .",
    "1995 ) can not be definitively ruled out on the basis of the x - ray data alone .",
    "however , the absence of strong , broad emission lines in the optical spectra as well as the detection of radio emission , possibly favours a bl lac interpretation . of course , further variability and polarization observations in the optical and radio wavebands are necessary to confirm the bl lac hypothesis .",
    "we note that if ms1019 + 5139 is found indeed to be a bl lac then it will be an atypical one both because of its flat x - ray spectrum and its optical emission lines and will be worthy of further study .",
    ".spectral fitting results for ms1019 + 5139 .",

    "the plasma temperature , kt , is in kev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in summary , the   observations provide powerful constraints on the nature of these objects .",
