    "the characterization of states of matter in terms of spontaneously broken symmetries and the corresponding order parameters , known as ginzburg - landau theory @xcite , is one of the most important concepts in condensed matter theory .",
    "perhaps the best known and studied example is that of magnetic order , for instance originating from strong electronic interactions . remarkably , there also exist insulating phases of matter which do not break any symmetries , yet are distinct from simple band insulators .",
    "the first such state to be discovered was the integer _",
    "quantum hall state _ of a two - dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic field @xcite , see @xcite for an introduction .",
    "its quantized hall conductivity ( in two dimensions , conductance and conductivity are identical ) can be explained by the existence of a topological invariant ( the chern number ) calculated from a single - particle hamiltonian @xcite . because this number can not change under adiabatic transformations of the hamiltonian ,",
    "the integer quantum hall state is topologically different from a trivial band insulator . in particular , a transition between these two states can only occur via a closing of the band gap . as a result ,",
    "metallic states emerge at the edge of quantum hall samples @xcite .",
    "moreover , while atomic insulators may be described as product states of completely local electronic wave functions , topological states show a distinct response to boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "haldane @xcite showed that a quantum hall state with broken time - reversal symmetry can not only be achieved with an external magnetic field , but also with a periodic magnetic flux .",
    "_ topological insulators _",
    "( a name apparently first coined in @xcite ) represent another class of states that are topologically distinct from simple band insulators .",
    "they are symmetric under time reversal , and can therefore be realized experimentally without magnetic fields .",
    "topological insulators were first discovered in a theoretical model for graphene @xcite , in the context of the search for an intrinsic quantum spin hall effect .",
    "kane and mele @xcite showed that the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling gives rise to an insulating state with a topological band structure , and a nonzero spin hall response related to metallic edge states that are protected against perturbations by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "topological insulators in three dimensions were predicted soon after @xcite , and are by now well confirmed by experiments @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional topological insulators , or _ quantum spin hall insulators _ , have close conceptual relations to integer quantum hall states : in the simplest case , the theoretical model of kane and mele @xcite is completely equivalent to two decoupled copies ( with opposite chirality for the two spin directions ) of the haldane model for the integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "while the spin - orbit gap in graphene is too small to permit experimental observation ( about @xmath0 mev , see for example @xcite ; an experimentally observable spin - orbit gap has been predicted for silicene @xcite , see @xcite ) for experimental progress with this honeycomb material ) , the quantum spin hall state has been observed in cdte / hgte / cdte heterostructures @xcite .",
    "as first predicted theoretically @xcite , the low - energy physics of this system is determined by the gap at the @xmath1 point .",
    "if the hgte quantum well has a thickness below a critical value @xmath2 of 6.3 nm , the band structure is dominated by the surrounding cdte layers , and the normal regime , with the s ( @xmath3 ) bands lying energetically above the p ( @xmath4 ) bands , is realized .",
    "if the thickness exceeds the critical value , the band structure becomes dominated by that of the quantum well , and band inversion takes place .",
    "bernevig @xcite predicted samples with such an inverted band structure to be quantum spin hall insulators with a band gap of tens of mev , which was soon verified experimentally @xcite .    in the absence of interactions ,",
    "topological insulators can be understood in terms of single - particle hamiltonians , allowing for a full classification based on time - reversal , particle - hole , and chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "recently , an extension to include crystal symmetries has been given @xcite .",
    "this review is primarily concerned with correlation effects , which have been explored in the context of topological insulators in several different settings .",
    "the most direct way to theoretically explore correlation effects is to consider the impact of electron - electron interactions on a noninteracting quantum spin hall state by adding interactions to models with intrinsic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "remarkably , some of these models permit the application of exact numerical methods .",
    "with regard to experiment , such studies are relevant for materials with significant spin - orbit and electron - electron interactions .",
    "this situation is expected to occur in , for example , the transition - metal oxide @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the interplay of strong correlations and spin - orbit coupling in this and other materials may allow for realizations of complex spin models @xcite and hence may provide a route to quantum spin liquids @xcite",
    ".    even in materials with rather weak intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , robust quantum spin hall states can emerge from strong electronic correlations via a dynamically generated spin - orbit coupling that is the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the resulting _ topological mott insulators _ , states with a band gap generated by interactions and edge states protected by time - reversal symmetry , have so far been explored only at the mean - field level . the term topological mott insulator is also used in the literature to refer to exotic states in which the interplay of spin - orbit coupling and electronic correlations leads to spin - charge separation , gapped charge excitations , and a topological band structure carried by low - energy spinon excitations @xcite .",
    "a novel mott state arising from strong spin - orbit interaction has been found experimentally in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a third direction of research is concerned with fractional topological insulators .",
    "the fractional quantum hall state is a famous example of a topological phase emerging from strong electronic interactions ( for a concise introduction see @xcite ) . in the latter , strong repulsion among electrons occupying partially filled ,",
    "flat landau levels leads to intriguing insulating states with quasi - particle excitations that carry fractional charge and have fractional statistics .",
    "fractional quantum hall states have been a major research topic for several decades , with enormous progress in theory and experiment , and potential applications in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "remarkably , much of the physics of the fractional quantum hall effect can in theory also exist in chern insulators @xcite , described by models that break time - reversal symmetry but have zero net magnetic flux , and are hence similar in spirit to haldane s model for the integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "proposals for the experimental realization of fractional chern insulators involve materials with flat bands that allow for an enhancement of electron - electron interactions @xcite . in close analogy to the noninteracting case , _ fractional quantum spin hall insulators _ can be constructed by , in the simplest case , combining two fractional quantum hall states @xcite .",
    "the theory of time - reversal invariant insulators with protected edge states is one of the most active current research areas ( see section  [ sec : bulk : fqhe ] ) .    in the context of correlated electrons ,",
    "the concept of topological order has yet another , important meaning .",
    "quite generally , a topologically ordered state is robust with respect to adiabatic transformations of the hamiltonian . in the case of the @xmath7",
    "topological insulators , as realized for example in the kane - mele model @xcite , this robustness is mathematically expressed by a topological invariant . however , even in the presence of electron - electron interactions , this state  having its origin in a topological band structure  is adiabatically connected to a noninteracting band insulator .",
    "a classification of such states based on chern - simons theory has recently been given @xcite .",
    "topological band insulators are distinct from the class of topological states that emerge from interactions and are not adiabatically connected to a noninteracting state . a particularly fascinating example are quantum spin liquids , which are insulating states  arising from quantum fluctuations  that do not break any symmetries but have highly nontrivial correlations . for the latter , the term _ topological order _ implies @xcite ( i ) the existence of a gap to excited states , ( ii ) a topological ground - state degeneracy in a periodic system ( a torus geometry in two dimensions ) , and ( iii ) the existence of fractional quasi - particle excitations with abelian or non - abelian statistics . whereas ( i ) is also typical of topological band insulators , ( ii ) and ( iii ) are not .",
    "on the other hand , fractional quantum hall liquids and hence also fractional topological insulators possess topological order .",
    "an important recent development is the use of the concept of quantum entanglement to study and classify topological states @xcite .",
    "whereas topological insulators are characterized by short - range quantum entanglement and fall into the class of _ symmetry - protected topological states _",
    "( stable with respect to perturbations that do not break the symmetry that underlies the topological properties ) , fractional topological states and quantum spin liquids have long - range quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "whereas any short - range entangled state can be transformed into a product state by means of _ local unitary transformations _",
    ", such a transformation is not possible in the presence of long - range quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "a classification of topological states , including correlated states , can be obtained by considering local unitary transformations with different symmetries . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional topological insulators are realized by several different materials @xcite .",
    "strong correlation effects haven been argued to play a role in @xmath8 ( a potential topological kondo insulator ) @xcite and in actinide compounds such as @xmath9 ( identified as a @xmath7 topological insulator in theoretical calculations ) @xcite .",
    "a candidate system for a topological mott insulator is @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , experiments for the two - dimensional case are so far restricted to hgte quantum wells @xcite , and do not reveal any substantial electronic correlation effects .",
    "consequently , the study of correlated quantum spin hall insulators has so far been a predominantly theoretical effort .",
    "the search for candidate condensed matter settings is guided by the fact that the spin - orbit coupling increases with the atomic number .",
    "for example , strong and comparable electron - electron and spin - orbit interactions are expected for ir - based transition metal oxides @xcite , with numerical evidence for a strongly correlated quantum spin hall state @xcite , and the possibility of a topological mott insulator phase @xcite .",
    "another useful experimental setting are heterostructures of transition - metal oxides , for example a bilayer of @xmath10 sandwiched between @xmath11 layers @xcite .",
    "such structures provide substantial tunability @xcite , and have been proposed to realize topological phases emerging from either intrinsic spin - orbit coupling @xcite , or from interaction - induced ordering of complex orbitals @xcite .",
    "interaction induced topological phases may also exist in stacked graphene @xcite , whereas the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling may be sufficiently enhanced in decorated graphene @xcite or in molecular graphene @xcite to make a topological phase observable .",
    "although concrete materials for fractional topological insulators have not yet been identified , several candidate systems for chern insulators are known , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "cold atoms in optical lattices , or on atom chips , provide an alternative route toward correlated topological states . using suitable artificial gauge fields @xcite , @xmath7 topological insulators with tunable interactions may be realized @xcite .",
    "the use of rydberg atoms has also been suggested to realize topological mott insulators @xcite and fractional quantum hall states @xcite .",
    "finally , correlated topological states may also be engineered with photons in cavity arrays , see @xcite .    despite the rather short history of topological insulators ,",
    "the literature is remarkably rich .",
    "given the background of the authors , this review aims at providing an overview of work on electronic correlation effects in two dimensions , with a focus on models with intrinsic spin - orbit coupling and numerical studies .",
    "it thereby complements earlier reviews by hasan and kane @xcite , moore @xcite , and qi and zhang @xcite , but omits other fascinating topics such as three - dimensional topological insulators @xcite , topological kondo insulators @xcite , or topological superconductors @xcite . for a self - contained presentation",
    ", it includes an introduction to noninteracting quantum spin hall insulators using the example of the kane - mele model .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : models ] , the most widely used theoretical models are introduced .",
    "a discussion of noninteracting quantum spin hall insulators is provided in section  [ sec : noninteracting ] .",
    "correlation effects on bulk properties are considered in section  [ sec : bulk ] , whereas correlated helical edge states are the topic of section  [ sec : edge ] .",
    "the calculation of topological invariants for correlated systems is reviewed in section  [ sec : index ] , and section  [ sec : conclusions ] gives conclusions and an outlook .",
    "since the proposal by kane and mele @xcite , a number of theoretical models for the quantum hall and spin hall effect have been discovered .",
    "the general structure of such models and possible realizations in semiconductors were discussed , for example , in @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "spinless quantum hall models can readily be generalized to describe time - reversal invariant quantum spin hall states by introducing a spin - orbit gap with a spin - dependent sign . here",
    "the emphasis is on some of the most popular models that support a topological state originating from spin - orbit coupling in the absence of electronic interactions .",
    "overviews of theoretical models can also be found in @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the quantum spin hall models considered here is that the hamiltonians may be expressed in terms of @xmath12 dirac matrices @xcite . given inversion symmetry , such a representation is particularly useful to determine the topological invariant in the absence of interactions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding matrix representations of the km and the bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model can be found in @xcite . to study local , hubbard - type interactions , and also for numerical methods ,",
    "the tight - binding real - space representations are more appropriate .    because of the topological character of the quantum spin hall state , the details of the hamiltonian play a minor role , and different models share similar low - energy physics .",
    "in particular , universal field theory descriptions can be obtained using chern - simons theory for the gapped bulk @xcite , and helical luttinger liquid theory for the gapless edges @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned requirement of at least four orbitals per unit cell ( here the term orbital may also refer to spin or pseudospin ) or , equivalently , four states at a given momentum @xmath13 in the noninteracting bloch picture , can be understood as follows : the two spin directions are related by time - reversal symmetry and hence degenerate .",
    "a band insulator , with a gap between filled valence bands and empty conduction bands and hence not adiabatically connected to the vacuum , then requires two sets of kramers degenerate bands , and hence four bands in total @xcite .    while some features are generic for quantum spin hall models , there are also model - specific aspects related to , for example , the crystal lattice .",
    "an important example is the potential quantum spin liquid phase of the kmh model , which was first reported for the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "this lattice has the smallest possible coordination number @xmath14 in two dimensions , rendering quantum fluctuations particularly important .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is also at the centre of attention in condensed matter physics because of tremendous progress in preparing single layers or bilayers of graphene @xcite .",
    "much of the work reviewed here uses the paradigmatic framework of a local hubbard interaction to study electronic correlation effects @xcite .",
    "this choice , usually motivated by simplicity , is assumed to capture the dominant physics .",
    "models with nonlocal interactions play a key role for topological mott insulators with dynamically generated spin - orbit interactions ( see section  [ sec : bulk : topmott ] ) , and for spinless models of chern insulators ( see section  [ sec : bulk : fqhe ] ) .",
    "nonlocal interactions may also give rise to interesting new physics in helical liquids @xcite .",
