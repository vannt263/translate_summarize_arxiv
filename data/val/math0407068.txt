    "in the late 1990 s , there were some breakthrough ideas for constructing new invariants of legendrian links in @xmath1 .",
    "these invariants came from adapting the techniques of pseudoholomorphic curves , a powerful tool in the study of symplectic manifolds , to the setting of contact manifolds , via contact homology @xcite .",
    "combinatorial ways of calculating these  holomorphic \" invariants were developed from both the lagrangian and the front projections of a legendrian link @xcite .    in this paper , the focus will be to study links in the 1-jet space of the circle , @xmath2 , a manifold diffeomorphic to the solid torus @xmath3 : @xmath4 with contact structure given by @xmath5 .",
    "viewing @xmath6 as a quotient of the unit interval , @xmath7 : 0 \\sim 1 \\ } [ 0,1]/(0\\sim 1)$ ] , we can visualize knots in @xmath2 as quotients of arcs in @xmath8 with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "links in @xmath2 were examined by one of the authors using the technique of generating functions , @xcite . in this paper holomorphic techniques",
    "are developed to study these and other links . in section  [ sec : invariants ] , the theory underlying the holomorphic invariants is developed .",
    "given the `` lagrangian '' @xmath9-projection of a legendrian link in @xmath2 , it is possible to combinatorially define the chekanov  eliashberg differential graded algebra ( dga ) over @xmath10 , in a manner exactly following the definition in @xmath1 from @xcite .",
    "however , as in @xmath1 , it is often more convenient to work in the `` front '' @xmath11-projection rather than the lagrangian @xmath9-projection . to do this",
    ", we introduce a suitable modification of the resolution technique for @xmath1 from @xcite , which produces a lagrangian projection from a front projection . using this resolution , and in parallel to the @xmath1 theory , we can associate to legendrian links in @xmath2 invariants such as poincar  chekanov polynomials , which measure the homology of a linearized version of the chekanov  eliashberg dga , and characteristic algebras , which measure some nonlinear information from the dga .",
    "we also make use of the additional structure on the dga provided by mishachev s homotopy splitting , @xcite . for multi - component links , this results in split poincar ",

    " chekanov polynomial agrees with the negative generating function polynomial , see remark  [ rmk : holo_vs_gf ] .",
    "this gives evidence for the following principle , which seems to hold for other contact manifolds as well :    this principle has been verified for all solid - torus links for which generating function polynomials have been defined . at present , this does not include all solid - torus links , and so there are instances in which the linearized dga is applicable but generating functions are not .",
    "in addition , we will present an example of two links for which the generating function polynomials are defined and equal , but which can be distinguished by the full dga via characteristic algebras .",
    "we now look at some concrete examples of links which can be distinguished by one means or another .",
    "the first example in figure  [ fig : link+knot_flypes ] gives topologically equivalent links that do not have the same polynomials ( generating function or poincar  chekanov ) and are hence not legendrian isotopic .",

    "thus the polynomials of @xmath25 and @xmath18 agree .",
    "however , a calculation of their characteristic algebras shows that these are in fact distinct ; see proposition  [ prop : l_k_1,k_2_vs_l_0,j_2 ] .",
    "a solution to this problem raises some new interesting questions .",
    "for example , a slight modification of the constructions in figure  [ fig : intro_connect_sum ] produces the knots in figure  [ fig : l_2_3 ] that have tamely isomorphic dgas .",

    ", width=384 ]    we include a short appendix which describes a technique , different from the dga or generating functions , which can also distinguish legendrian solid - torus links .",
    "the relevant construction , which we call a legendrian satellite , constructs a link in standard contact @xmath1 from a link in the solid torus .",
    "we show that legendrian satellites can be used to recover some of the results derived in this paper using the dga or in @xcite using generating functions , and can even be applied in cases where neither of the other techniques works .",

    "we also thank the hospitality of the institute for advanced study in 20012002 when further ideas were developed .",
    "as in standard contact @xmath1 , apart from topological type , oriented legendrian links in @xmath2 have two classical contact invariants , rotation number @xmath26 and thurston  bennequin number @xmath27 . these are defined in precisely the same way as in @xmath1 ; for instance , in the `` front '' @xmath11-projection , @xmath28 is the number of cusps oriented downwards minus the number oriented upwards , and @xmath27 is the number of crossings , counted with the usual signs , minus the number of right cusps . in @xcite ,",

    "the cases of interest to us will be knots and particular links for which there is a canonical way to choose auxiliary points .",
    "we address these cases in turn ; the definition of gradings for a general link , which we omit here , can be inferred from the corresponding definition for links in @xmath1 in @xcite . for the front of a legendrian knot in @xmath2",

    "the degree of each right cusp is @xmath0 . for a crossing @xmath63 in the resolved front projection , traverse the knot beginning at the greater - slope strand at the crossing , and ending when the crossing is reached again , and let @xmath64 be the number of cusps traversed upwards minus the number traversed downwards . if @xmath63 is a normal crossing , then @xmath65 ; if @xmath63 is a special crossing , then @xmath66 . by extending degree multiplicatively ( i.e. , @xmath67 )",

    "for each @xmath86 , fix a base point @xmath87 on an initial branch of @xmath88 , and let @xmath89 denote this set of base points .    to each crossing , we associate two `` capping paths '' @xmath90 : @xmath91 is a path from @xmath53 through @xmath84 to a point in @xmath92 while @xmath93 is a path from @xmath53 through @xmath85 to a point in @xmath92 . for each such path @xmath94 ,",

    "it is then easy to check that @xmath99 does not depend on the choice of paths @xmath91 , @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , proposition 5.3 in @xcite shows that a path between any two points in initial branches contains an equal number of up and down cusps .",

    "we then examine several examples for which legendrian satellites can be applied , including a pair of solid - torus knots which can not be distinguished by their dgas but can be distinguished through satellites .",
    "legendrian satellites are the legendrian analogue of satellites in the topological category .",

    "write @xmath489 for the inverse of @xmath488 , and let @xmath38 be the double of the standard unknot in @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : torusgluing ] ) . for @xmath490 ,",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath491 is precisely the oriented whitehead link from @xcite , and that @xmath492 is the same link with one component reversed .",
    "proposition  [ prop : torusgluing ] and ( * ? ? ?",
