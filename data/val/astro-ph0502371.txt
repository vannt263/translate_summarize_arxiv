    "an accretion disk surrounding a neutron star interacts with the magnetic field of the neutron star . in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ,",
    "angular momentum supplied from the accretion disk accelerates the rotation of the neutron star .",
    "these objects are sometimes observed as rejuvenated radio pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . even in isolated radio pulsars , recent observations by the chandra x - ray satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) revealed the existence of disk - like distribution of hot plasmas around the pulsar and the existence of bipolar jets .",
    "magnetic interaction between the neutron star and its surrounding disk can be the origin of jet - like outflows .",
    "the interaction between a magnetized star ( neutron star , white dwarf or a young stellar object ) and its accretion disk has been studied extensively . when magnetic field lines connect the star and its disk , their torque spins up or down the central star ( e.g. , @xcite , , ; @xcite ) .",
    "zylstra ( 1988 ) obtained a sequence of twisted force - free fields around a neutron star and showed that when critical twist is accumulated , loss of equilibrium leads to the expansion of the magnetosphere .",
    "lynden - bell and boily ( 1994 ) used semianalytic techniques for non - relativistic force - free configurations . by studying the evolution of force - free magnetic loops anchored to the star and the disk , they obtained self - similar solutions for it .",
    "they found that twist injection from the rotating disk makes the magnetic loops unstable and inflate and that the loops expand along the direction @xmath1 from the rotational axis of the disk .",
    "lovelace  ( ) applied this mechanism to keplerian disks .",
    "in non - relativistic mhd case , hayashi , shibata , and matsumoto ( 1996 ) carried out two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetic interaction between a star and its disk .",
    "they showed that magnetic reconnection takes place in the current sheet created inside the inflating magnetic loops .",
    "their model can explain the x - ray flares and outflows observed in protostars .",
    "miller and stone ( 1997 ) presented the results of simulation including the rotation of the central star .",
    "goodson  ( 1997 , 1999 ) and goodson and winglee ( 1999 ) carried out longer time scale simulations of star - disk magnetic interaction and demonstrated quasi - periodic formation and destruction of magnetosphere by twist injection from the disk .",
    "kato , hayashi , and matsumoto ( 2004 ) reported the results of mhd simulation of the magnetic interaction between a neutron star and its disk .",
    "they showed that due to the gas pressure external to the expanding loop , magnetic tower ( @xcite ) is formed and that semi - relativistic jet flows out along the magnetic tower .",
    "this mechanism can explain the origin of semi - relativistic jets observed in sco x-1 ( @xcite , ) . in their simulation , however , special relativistic effects were neglected .    in magnetospheres of neutron stars ,",
    "relativistic effects are not negligible .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the disk - star magnetic interaction model to a relativistic regime .",
    "when plasma density is low or magnetic field is strong , the alfvn speed can be close to the light speed .",
    "thus , we need to solve relativistic equations to study the evolution of the magnetosphere . here",
    "we present numerical results for the magnetosphere dominated by the electromagnetic field , which can be described by time dependent relativistic force - free equations .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out simulations of relativistic force - free fields to study the electrodynamics of pulsar magnetospheres and black holes . here",
    "we extend the model for the case including a rotating equatorial disk threading the magnetosphere .    in section @xmath2",

    "the results of simulations are given in section @xmath3 .",
    "section @xmath4 is devoted for summary and discussion .",
    "we use force - free equations ( e.g. @xcite for basic theory of force - free fields ) derived from the special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( srmhd ) equations to simulate the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the force - free approximation is applicable when the electromagnetic energy density is much larger than the energy density of the plasma .",

    ". however , we can assume the existence of the plasma that is frozen to the magnetic fields . if equation ( [ eq : li ] ) is satisfied , the plasma can flow along the magnetic field lines .",
    "we use the hll method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to solve the time dependent equations .",
    "it belongs to the family of an upwind scheme .",
    "in contrast to the roe type scheme which requires eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the characteristic matrix , hll scheme only needs eigenvalues .",
    "we used muscl - type method to attain second order accuracy in space .",
