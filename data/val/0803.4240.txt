    "cellular automata ( cas ) are discrete dynamical systems that have been studied for years due to their architectural simplicity and the wide spectrum of behaviors they are capable of @xcite . here",
    "we study cas that can be said to perform a simple `` computational '' task .",
    "one such task is the so - called _ majority _ or _ density _",
    "task in which a two - state ca is to decide whether the initial state contains more zeros than ones or vice versa . in spite of its apparent simplicity ,",
    "it is a difficult problem for a ca as it requires a coordination among the automata . as such",
    ", it is a perfect paradigm of the phenomenon of _ emergence _ in complex systems .",
    "that is , the task solution is an emergent global property of a system of locally interacting agents .",
    "indeed , it has been proved that no ca can perform the task perfectly i.e. , for any possible initial binary configuration of states @xcite .",
    "however , several efficient cas for the density task have been found either by hand or by using heuristic methods , especially evolutionary computation @xcite .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "all previous investigations have empirically shown that finding good cas for the majority task is very hard .",
    "however , there have been no investigations , to our knowledge , of the reasons that make this particular fitness landscape a difficult one . in this paper",
    "we statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of searching the majority ca landscape .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "the next section summarizes some known facts about cas for the density task .",
    "a description of its fitness landscape follows , focusing on the hardness and neutrality aspects .",
    "next we identify and analyze a particular subspace of the problem search space called the olympus .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and hints to further works and open questions .",
    "the density task is a prototypical distributed computational problem for cas . for a finite ca of size",
    "@xmath0 it is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be the fraction of 1s in the _ initial configuration _",
    "( ic ) @xmath2 .",
    "the task is to determine whether @xmath1 is greater than or less than @xmath3 . in this version ,",
    "the problem is also known as the _ majority _ problem .",
    "if @xmath4 then the ca must relax to a fixed - point configuration of all 1 s that we indicate as @xmath5 ; otherwise it must relax to a fixed - point configuration of all 0 s , noted @xmath6 , after a number of time steps of the order of the grid size @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath0 is set to 149 , the value that has been customarily used in research on the density task ( if @xmath0 is odd one avoids the case @xmath7 for which the problem is undefined ) .",
    "this computation is trivial for a computer having a central control .",
    "indeed , just scanning the array and adding up the number of , say , 1 bits will provide the answer in @xmath8 time .",
    "however , it is nontrivial for a small radius one - dimensional ca since such a ca can only transfer information at finite speed relying on local information exclusively , while density is a global property of the configuration of states .",
    "it has been shown that the density task can not be solved perfectly by a uniform , two - state ca with finite radius @xcite .",
    "the lack of a perfect solution does not prevent one from searching for imperfect solutions of as good a quality as possible . in general , given a desired global behavior for a ca ( e.g. , the density task ) , it is extremely difficult to infer the local ca rule that will give rise to the emergence of the computation sought .",
    "this is because of the possible nonlinearities and large - scale collective effects that can not in general be predicted from the sole local ca updating rule , even if it is deterministic . since exhaustive evaluation of all possible rules is out of the question except for elementary ( @xmath9 ) and perhaps radius - two automata , one possible solution consists in using evolutionary algorithms , as first proposed by packard in @xcite and further developed by mitchell et al .",
    "+ the _ standard performance _ of the best rules ( with @xmath10 ) found at the end of the evolution is defined as the fraction of correct classifications over @xmath11 randomly chosen ics .",
    "the ics are sampled according to a binomial distribution ( i.e. , each bit is independently drawn with probability @xmath3 of being 0 ) .",
    "+ mitchell and coworkers performed a number of studies on the emergence of synchronous ca strategies for the density task ( with @xmath12 ) during evolution @xcite .",
    "their results are significant since they represent one of the few instances where the dynamics of emergent computation in complex , spatially extended systems can be understood . as for the evolved cas , it was noted that , in most runs , the ga found unsophisticated strategies that consisted in expanding sufficiently large blocks of adjacent 1s or 0s .",
    "this `` block - expanding '' strategy is unsophisticated in that it mainly uses local information to reach a conclusion . as a consequence ,",
    "only those ic that have low or high density are classified correctly since they are more likely to have extended blocks of 1s or 0s .",
    "these cas have a performance around @xmath13 .",
    "a few runs yielded more sophisticated cas with performance ( around @xmath14 ) on a wide distribution of ics .",
    "however , high - performance automata have evolved only nine times out of @xmath15 runs of the genetic algorithm .",
    "this clearly shows that the search space is a very difficult one , even there exists some recent works on coevolutionary algorithm @xcite which able to find a number of `` block expanding '' strategies .",
    "these sophisticated strategies rely on traveling signals ( `` particles '' ) that transfer spatial and temporal information about the density in local regions through the lattice , and have been quantitatively described with a framework known as `` computational mechanics '' @xcite .",
    "the gkl rule @xcite is hand - coded but its behavior is similar to that of the best solutions found by evolution .",
    "das and davis solutions are two other good solutions that have been found by hand @xcite .",
    "other researchers have been able to artificially evolve a better ca ( @xmath16 ) by using genetic programming@xcite .",
    "finally , juill _ et al _ @xcite obtained still better cas ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) by using a coevolutionary algorithm .",
    "their coevolved ca has performance about 0.86 , which is the best result known to date .",
    "we call the six best local optima known , with a standard performance over @xmath19 , the _ blok _ ( tab .",
    "[ tab - opt6 ] ) .    in the next section we present a study of the overall fitness landscape ,",
    "while section [ olympus ] concentrates on the structure of the landscape around the _",
    "blok_.    .description in hexadecimal and standard performance of the 6 previously known best rules ( _ blok _ ) computed on sample size of @xmath20.[tab - opt6 ] [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ [ neutral - degree . ] ] neutral degree .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the figure [ fig - neutr]-b gives the neutral degree of solutions from olympus as a function of their performance .",
    "the solutions below performance @xmath21 are randomly chosen in olympus .",
    "the solutions over performance @xmath21 are sampled with 2 runs of a ga during @xmath22 generations .",
    "this ga is based on ga defined by mitchell @xcite where the operators are restricted to olympus subspace and the selection is a tournament selection of size 2 taking into account the neutrality .",
    "this ga allows to discover a lot of solutions between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and justified the useful of olympus runs , average performances are @xmath25 with standard deviation @xmath26 which is higher than @xmath27 of coevolutionary algorithm of pagie @xcite ] .",
    "two important @xmath28 are located around fitnesses @xmath29 and @xmath21 where the neutral degree is over @xmath30 . for solutions over @xmath21 ,",
    "the average of neutral degree is 37.6 which is a high neutral degree .",
    "the landscape has a considerable number of points with performance @xmath29 or @xmath21 which means that investigations based on sampling techniques on the whole landscape are unlikely to give good results .",
    "the neutrality of the landscape is high , and the neutral network topology is not completely random . exploiting similarities between the six best rules and symmetries in the landscape , we have defined the _ olympus _ landscape as a subspace of the majority problem landscape .",
    "this subspace have less solutions with performance @xmath29 and it is easy to find solutions over @xmath23 with a simple ga . we have shown that the neutrality of landscape is high even for solution over @xmath21 .",
