    "the magnetic field was set to zero , which removes the energy splitting of the @xmath15(@xmath16 ) manifold . to achieve the same acceleration on the @xmath40 states as with magnetic field , the detuning of the @xmath37 osg beam was set to @xmath51mhz from the center of the @xmath16 manifold . without magnetic field ,",
    "the spatial splitting between neighboring high @xmath20 states is slightly reduced . to separate these states further than done in the experiment , a larger magnetic field could be used .",
    "the simulation also suggests an alternative osg separation scheme , which is demonstrated in row ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , but which we did not check experimentally . instead of one blue and one red detuned osg beam , the scheme uses two blue detuned osg beams of opposite circular polarization . as",

    "the @xmath52 beam acts mainly on the negative @xmath10-state atoms and pushes them upwards .",
    "since this beam is now blue detuned , it does not act similar to a lens as the red detuned @xmath52 beam used in the experiment and leads to less distortion of the cloud .",
    "three cases of this alternative scheme are shown in row ( c ) , always assuming an even atom number distribution over the @xmath10 states .",
    "case ( ci ) uses @xmath11-beam parameters equivalent to the ones used for the simulations of row ( a ) and @xmath52-beam parameters deduced from those as described above .",
    "in addition the magnetic field is set to zero .",
    "this situation leads to a nearly symmetric separation of positive and negative @xmath10 states , where the symmetry is only slightly broken by gravity .",
    "compared to the situation realized in the experiment , atoms in low @xmath10 states are better separated .",
    "one slight drawback of this scheme is that the application of a magnetic field as used in the experiment will only increase separation of positive @xmath10 states .",
    "the separation of negative @xmath10 states will even be decreased .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in case ( cii ) , where a magnetic field similar to the one used in the experiment is assumed and the detunings of the osg beams changed such that the initial accelerations of the @xmath40 states are the same as in case ( ci ) .",
    "the reason for the decreased separation of negative @xmath10 states is a reduction of the difference in the dipole forces of the @xmath52 beam on neighboring @xmath10 states .",
    "this reduction comes from the zeeman splitting of the @xmath15 @xmath16 level , which will tune transitions with strong line strength farther away from the @xmath52-beam wavelength than transitions with weak linestrength .",
    "the distortions of the density distribution after osg separation can be reduced if more power is available for the osg beams .",
    "then the waist of the osg beams can be made wider in the @xmath17-direction keeping the same potential in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "this leads to a reduction of unwanted potential gradients along @xmath17 , which are the source of the distortions well visible e.g. in ( aiii ) or ( ci ) .",

    "[ fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "the second approach uses the fit of the simulation to the data described above , which takes the distortions of the distribution better into account , but relies on our ability to accurately model the osg separation process .",
    "a systematic effect should be considered in both approaches : the @xmath10-state dependence of the average photon number absorbed by an atom during absorption imaging .",
    "this dependence has its origin in the @xmath10-state dependent line strength of the absorption imaging transition . under our imaging conditions ( probe beam of circularly polarized light on the @xmath5-@xmath23 transition with an intensity of 0.5mw / cm@xmath46 , an angle of 45@xmath54 to the quantization axis given by the magnetic field , and 40@xmath35s exposure time ) in average about 40 photons",
    "are scattered per atom , making optical pumping during absorption imaging important .",
    "we simulate this optical pumping process to obtain an estimate of the number of photons scattered by an atom in dependence of its initial @xmath10 state .",
    "we find that the optical pumping process depends strongly on the detuning of the absorption imaging beam to the closely spaced hyperfine states of the @xmath23 excited state , which are mixed at the 16 g magnetic field applied .",
    "because of this dependence , not only the absolute number of photons scattered per atom depends on the detuning , but also the ratio of the number of photons scattered for different initial states . for atoms starting in the @xmath55 or the @xmath56 state the ratio is highest , about 1.2(2 ) , where the error comes from the uncertainty of the laser detuning used in the experiment .",

    "a disadvantage of this method is that it delivers a reduced signal compared to imaging on the @xmath5-@xmath23 transition , as done after osg separation .",

    "atoms were initially removed from the @xmath62 state by optical pumping , whereas all other @xmath10 states remained populated ( a ) .",
    "after 10s hold at a magnetic field of 5 g ( b ) or 500 g ( c ) no @xmath62 atoms are detectable , showing the low rate of spin relaxation . ]",
    "a low nuclear spin - relaxation rate is an essential requirement to use @xmath0sr for quantum simulation and computation @xcite .",
    "the rate is expected to be small since the nuclear spin does not couple to the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground state . here",
    ", we use our nuclear spin state preparation and detection techniques to determine an upper bound for this spin relaxation rate .",
    "we start with a sample of @xmath66 atoms with near uniform @xmath10-state distribution and a temperature of @xmath67k , confined in a trap with oscillation frequencies @xmath68hz , @xmath69hz , and @xmath70hz , obtained directly after transferring the atoms from the magneto - optical trap to the dipole trap without any further evaporation .",
    "we optically pump all atoms from the @xmath62 state to neighboring states and look out for the reappearance of atoms in this state by spin relaxation during 10s of hold .",
    "the atom number in the @xmath62 state and , as a reference , the @xmath64 state are determined from absorption images . during 10s of hold at a magnetic field of either 5 g or 500 g the number of @xmath62 atoms remains below our detection threshold of about @xmath71 atoms , indicating a low spin - relaxation rate , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . from this observation",
    ", we can obtain an upper bound for the spin - relaxation rate . to obtain a conservative bound",
    ", we assume that the dominant process leading to the creation of @xmath62-state atoms are collisions of @xmath64- with @xmath72-state atoms , forming two @xmath62-state atoms .",
    "since the second order zeeman effect is negligible no energy is released in such a collision and the resulting @xmath62-state atoms will remain trapped .",
    "the number of atoms created in the @xmath62 state by spin relaxation after a hold time @xmath73 is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the atom number in each populated state , @xmath76 the spin - relaxation rate constant , @xmath77@xmath78 the mean density and the factor 2 takes into account that two atoms are produced in the @xmath62 state per collision . from our measurement",
    "we know that @xmath79 , from which we obtain an upper bound of @xmath80@xmath81s@xmath28 for the spin - relaxation rate constant .",
    "this bound for the rate constant corresponds for our sample to a spin relaxation rate which is 2000 times smaller than the elastic scattering rate .",
    "the rate constant could be even orders of magnitude smaller than the already low upper bound we obtained @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated two complementary methods to characterize the spin - state mixture of an ultracold cloud of @xmath0sr .",
    "optical stern - gerlach separation can characterize the spin - state mixture of an evaporatively cooled sample in a single experimental run and is very useful for fast optimization of optical pumping , which we have demonstrated by three examples .",
    "state selective absorption imaging can deliver spatially resolved information about the spin state , also for samples at @xmath35k temperatures . using these methods , we have determined an upper bound for the @xmath0sr spin relaxation rate and have found it to be low , as expected .",
    "these methods will be necessary tools for the implementation of quantum simulations and quantum computation making use of the @xmath0sr nuclear spin .",
