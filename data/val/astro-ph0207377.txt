    "characterizing the large - scale distribution of galaxies and clusters is critical for understanding the formation and evolution of this structure as well as for probing the initial conditions of the universe itself .",
    "the most widely used statistical measure for this purpose is the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) .",
    "this statistic is easily estimated , is simply parameterized , and is well - studied .",
    "the observed correlation function is approximately a power law over a finite range of scales ( totsuji & kihara 1969 ) , and thus can be expressed by two numbers , the power - law slope and the correlation length .",
    "this correlation function statistic has been successfully applied in the cosmological context for more than 30 years , thus its behavior is well understood theoretically .",
    "given a set of cosmological parameters , one can predict the corresponding mass 2pcf @xmath2 on a scale @xmath3 at a redshift @xmath4 using accurate fitting formulae ( e.g. , hamilton et al . 1991 ; peacock & dodds 1996 ) . in principle , the spatial biasing of luminous objects relative to the underlying dark matter may invalidate the straightforward comparison between observations and theoretical predictions .",
    "however , the sdss galaxy sample which we analyze is consistent with a ( practically ) scale - independent linear bias on scales of @xmath5mpc if one adopts the currently popular @xmath0-dominated spatially - flat cold dark mater ( lcdm ) model ( kayo et al .",
    "2002 ) .    while the 2pcf and its fourier transform the power spectrum are the most convenient and useful cosmological statistics , they completely ignore information about the correlations of the phases of the density fluctuations in @xmath6-space . in contrast , the topology of large - scale structure , as measured by the genus statistic ( gott , melott , & dickinson 1986 ) is strongly sensitive to these phase correlations .",
    "one of the minkowski functionals ( mecke , buchert & wagner 1994 ; schmalzing & buchert 1997 ) is closely related to the genus .",
    "other statistics that quantify phase correlations in the data include higher - order n - point correlation functions ( e.g. , peebles 1980 and references therein ) , percolation analysis ( shandarin 1983 ) , minimal spanning trees ( barrow , bhavsar & sonoda 1985 ) , and void statistics ( white 1979 ) .",
    "we focus on the genus mainly because its behavior is well - understood theoretically ; if the primordial fluctuations are gaussian , then the genus in the linear regime has an exact analytic expression ( see eq . [ [ eq : genus_rd ] ] below ) .",
    "the theoretical prediction for a gaussian random field makes it clear that only the amplitude of the genus depends on the 2pcf , while higher order correlations determine the shape as well as affecting the amplitude .",
    "thus , the shape of the genus statistic plays a complementary role to the 2pcf .",
    "in addition to the linear theory predictions , a perturbative expression for the genus in the weakly nonlinear regime has been obtained by matsubara ( 1994 ) and the log - normal model is shown to be a good empirical approximation in the strongly nonlinear regime ( e.g. , coles & jones 1991 ; hikage , taruya & suto 2002 ) .",

    "these investigations generally indicate consistency with the hypothesis that the initial perturbations were gaussian in nature . some departures from gaussianity",
    "have been suggested , but the statistical significance of the results was low due to the small size of the available data sets .",
    "hoyle et al . ( 2002b ) find weak evidence for variation in the genus with galaxy type in the sdss using the 2d genus statistic .",
    "in the present paper , we describe the first analysis of the 3d genus of the sdss early data release galaxy sample .",
    "we evaluate a variety of observational effects using mock catalogs from n - body simulations such as the shape of the survey volume , the redshift distortion effect , and the radial selection function due to the magnitude limit .",
    "to within the uncertainties for this preliminary sample , we find that the lcdm model reasonably reproduces the observed shape and amplitude of the genus of sdss galaxies .",

    "the resulting apparent - magnitude limited sample has a different mix of galaxy types at different redshifts .",
    "we do not consider the effect of this redshift dependence in the following analysis .",
    "note , however , that hoyle et al .",
    "( 2002b ) find a small difference of the two - dimensional genus for the reddest and bluest galaxies .",
    "we estimate the genus for the three - dimensional galaxy distribution in redshift space . for this purpose",
    ", we use the comoving distance computed from the observed redshift @xmath4 ( after correction for the local group motion ) of each galaxy : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the matter density parameter and @xmath20 is the dimensionless cosmological constant . because of this mapping , the density fields , and thus the genus constructed from the observed galaxy distribution , are dependent on the assumed set of cosmological parameters discussed below .",
    "to quantitatively evaluate various observational effects on the genus statistics such as the shape of survey volume , the redshift distortion effect , and the radial selection function , we generate various different mock samples which are summarized in table [ tab : data ] . all the mock catalogs are constructed from a series of the p@xmath21 m n - body simulations by jing & suto ( 1998 ) which employ @xmath22 particles in a @xmath23 periodic comoving box .",
    "these simulations use gaussian initial conditions and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) transfer function ( bardeen et al . 1986 ) .",
    "we neglect the light - cone effect ( hamana , colombi & suto 2001 ) over the survey volume for simplicity , and therefore use the @xmath24 snapshot simulation data in two cosmological models ; standard cdm ( scdm ) with @xmath1 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , and lambda cdm ( lcdm ) with @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the hubble constant in units of 100km / s / mpc , @xmath35 is the shape parameter of the transfer function , and @xmath36 is the r.m.s . mass fluctuation amplitude at @xmath37mpc .    to simulate the effect of the shape of the survey volume , we extract `` wedge(r ) '' samples of dark matter particles from the full simulation cube data in real space so that they have exactly the same volume shape as the northern and southern stripe regions . to construct mock samples that extend beyond the simulation box size",
    ", we duplicate particles using the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the unobserved gap regions are also taken into account . to examine the effect of redshift space distortions ,",
    "we construct `` wedge(z ) '' samples similar to the wedge(r ) samples but in redshift space using the radial peculiar velocity of the simulation particles to perturb the positions along the line of sight .",
    "to include the selection function due to the apparent - magnitude limits , we construct `` wedge@xmath38 '' samples from the wedge(r ) samples by applying the radial selection function expected for our limits @xmath39 and then add the peculiar velocity to each particle , so that the resulting particle distribution matches the redshift distribution of the observed galaxies ( see subsection [ subsec : selection ] ) . note that this procedure implicitly assumes that the luminosity functions constructed for the observed redshifts of objects do not suffer from the redshift - distortion effect . in order to check this , we also constructed the corresponding `` wedge@xmath38 '' samples by directly applying the selection function to the wedge(z ) samples .",
    "reassuringly , the two mock samples constructed from the slightly different procedures turned out to yield almost indistinguishable genus curves .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the luminosity functions are constructed with respect to the mean redshift of objects , and thus the peculiar velocity effect is statistically canceled . finally , we construct `` wedge@xmath40 '' samples that are spatially the same as the wedge@xmath38 samples , but where each simulation particle is weighted by the inverse of the selection function in the analysis so as to correct for the selection function in a straightforward manner .",
    "this yields the same correction to the simulated density field that is applied to the sdss edr galaxies when we compute the genus .",
    ".mock samples and sdss edr data adopted in the present analysis ( for @xmath41 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 100mm,100mm)figure11.eps    to correct for the different volumes of the full and wedge samples , we divide the genus of the full sample by the appropriate volume ratio .",
    "comparison of the genus shows that the wedge(r ) mock samples yield a larger genus amplitude than that of the full simulations , especially for @xmath42mpc .",
    "because the thickness of the wedge survey region of sdss edr is merely @xmath43 mpc at @xmath44 , a large fraction of the smoothing region lies outside the survey boundary , which leads to the unphysical behavior revealed here . in other words , our 3d analysis essentially reduces to a 2d analysis for @xmath42mpc . some of the clustering signal is effectively smoothed to beyond the survey boundary and not taken into account in the analysis which only includes grid vertices within the survey volume . thus the signal - to - noise ratio for structure within the survey",
    "is somewhat reduced",
    ". therefore it may not be meaningful to attempt to understand the detailed behavior of the genus curve on these larger smoothing scales for such a geometry .",
    "nevertheless one can still explore the cosmological implications by comparing the results between the ( final ) mock samples and the observed galaxies , since both data and simulations are treated in the same fashion .",
    "the wedge(z ) samples differ from the wedge(r ) samples only by introduction of the distortion of redshift space caused by peculiar velocities .",
    "this distortion has minimal effect on the genus , consistent with previous results ( matsubara 1996 ; matsubara & suto 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the more important observational effect comes from the apparent - magnitude limit of the sample , which changes the mean galaxy number density with redshift .",
    "appropriate correction for this selection function is necessary to accurately define the isodensity surfaces in apparent - magnitude limited samples .",

    "the plotted error - bars for each model prediction represent the 1 standard deviation computed from 15 independent mock samples . to within these uncertainties , we conclude that the genus for the sdss edr galaxies is consistent with the lcdm model prediction , but does not agree with that of scdm .",
    "galaxy biasing is another source of uncertainty for relating the observed genus curves to those obtained from the mock samples generated from the distribution of dark matter particles ( e.g. , colley et al . 2000 ; hikage , taruya , suto 2001 ) .",
    "if lcdm is the correct cosmological model , then the good match of the genus for mock samples from the lcdm simulations to the observed sdss genus may indicate that nonlinearity in the galaxy biasing is relatively small , at least small enough that it does not impact the genus statistic . in separate work , kayo et al .",

    "the genus as a function of volume fraction , expressed as @xmath61 , is sensitive only to the topology of the isodensity contours rather than evolution with time of the density threshold assigned to a contour .",

    "<S> we present the first analysis of three - dimensional genus statistics for the sdss edr galaxy sample . due to the complicated survey volume and the selection function , analytic predictions of the genus statistics for this sample </S>",
    "<S> are not feasible , therefore we construct extensive mock catalogs from n - body simulations in order to compare the observed data with model predictions . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison allows us to evaluate the effects of a variety of observational systematics on the estimated genus for the sdss sample , including the shape of the survey volume , the redshift distortion effect , and the radial selection function due to the magnitude limit . </S>",
    "<S> the observed genus for the sdss edr galaxy sample is consistent with that predicted by simulations of a @xmath0-dominated spatially - flat cold dark matter model . </S>",
    "<S> standard ( @xmath1 ) cold dark matter model predictions do not match the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how future sdss galaxy samples will yield improved estimates of the genus . </S>"
