    "the ixo payload consists of 1 ) the flight mirror assembly ( fma ) , a large area grazing incidence mirror ; 2 ) four instruments mounted in the mirror focal plane on a movable instrument platform ( mip ) , which are placed in the mirror focus one at a time ; and 3 ) an x - ray grating spectrometer ( xgs ) that intercepts and disperses a fraction of the beam from the mirror onto a ccd camera , operating simultaneously with the observing mip instrument @xcite .",

    "the 1 arcsec pixel size oversamples the beam and thus minimizes pulse pile up .",
    "the wfi s key component is the depfet ( depleted p - channel field effect transistor ) active pixel sensor ( aps ) .",
    "compared with earlier ccd - type detectors , the aps concept has the significant advantage that the charge produced by an incident x - ray photon is stored in and read directly from each pixel , which reduces readout noise , and offers radiation hardness .",
    "prototype depfet devices of @xmath25 pixels have been tested successfully ; an energy resolution at 5.9 kev of 126 ev has been demonstrated .",

    "two viable grating technologies reduces risk .",
    "one utilizes critical angle transmission ( cat ) gratings with heritage from the chandra high energy transmission grating , but substantially higher efficiency .",
    "another approach uses `` off plane '' reflection gratings based on xmm - newton gratings . to give higher performance",
    "the ixo gratings are ruled along the direction of incidence rather than perpendicular to it as on xmm - newton .",
    "the high time resolution spectrometer ( htrs ) will perform precise timing measurements of bright x - ray sources with fluxes of @xmath29  counts per second in the 0.3 - 10 kev band , while providing moderate spectral resolution ( 200 ev fwhm at 6 kev ) .",

    "xpol utilizes a fine grid gas pixel detector to image the tracks of photoelectrons produced by incident x - rays , which convey information about the polarization .",
