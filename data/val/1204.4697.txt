    "classical theory of superconductivity for impure materials deals with average quantities . within the bcs approach",
    "the average fundamental characteristics of s - wave superconductor such as transition temperature , gap , and density of states are not sensitive to potential disorder .",
    "this statement , known as anderson theorem , is , in fact , not rigid at all . in particular , it is enough to introduce in s - wave superconductors some amount of magnetic impurities and they suppress the transition temperature and gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "moreover , in the case of more complex symmetry of the order parameter , even elastic impurities depress superconductivity .",
    "it is worth to note that average parameters do not completely describe properties of impure materials , because , in addition , disorder induces random point - to - point variations of all quantities .",
    "for instance , it is well known since 60 s , that the ldos of normal metal near an isolated impurity experiences so called friedel oscillations at the atomic scale.@xcite    at the end of 70 s  beginning of 80 s the theory of weak localization was developed which described the corrections to _ average _ values of transport characteristics of impure electron systems caused by the quantum interference of electrons due to their multiple impurity scattering.@xcite even though these corrections of quantum origin were found to be small in comparison to the corresponding classical values , it was demonstrated that they have nontrivial dependences on temperature , frequency , and magnetic field , what makes them experimentally accessible . even though the quantum interference itself does not effect the average value of dos",
    ", the nontrivial corrections to this quantity appear when , in addition , the interelectron interaction is taken into account .    during mid 80 s ,",
    "the _ spatial variations _ of the ldos , conductivity and other normal - metal properties have been revisited within the framework of the mesoscopic physics.@xcite it was found that the quantum interference effects also lead to appearance of nontrivial corrections to inhomogeneous characteristics , for instance , to the ldos correlation function.@xcite in contrast to the fast  atomic - scale contribution of the friedel oscillations , the latter manifest themselves in smooth long - range spatial behavior of the ldos correlation function as the slow  power ( or logarithmic in 2d case ) decay on the distances beyond the mean - free path @xmath1 and up to the phase - breaking length @xmath2 ( each of them is much larger than interatomic distances ) .",
    "one can recognize the physical origin of such phenomenon in spirit of the qualitative explanation of the weak localization corrections given in terms of self - intersecting trajectories.@xcite    the electron motion in impure metal has the diffusive character .",
    "for every pair of remote points @xmath3 and @xmath4 with finite probability one can find the self - intersecting quasiclassical trajectory which starts from the point @xmath3 , passes close to the point @xmath5 , and returns back to the initial point .",
    "an important property is the existence of the opposite returning trajectory , which outcomes from the point @xmath5 , passes close to the point @xmath3 , and returns to the point @xmath5 following roughly the same route [ see fig .  [ figdiagram ] ( a ) ] .",
    "these two trajectories have two long joint pieces where the electron motion is accompanied by the multiple scattering on the same impurities .",
    "when time - inversion symmetry is present , particles can move along these trajectories both in the same or in the opposite directions .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ figdiagram](a ) one can see that for each trajectory there are the entry and the exit points of the joint routes ( marked by circles ) separated by the distances @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the trajectory origin .",
    "existence of such diffusive trajectories leads to long - range correlation of different properties , in particular , the local density of states .",
    "quantitatively , this phenomenon can be described by the standard green s function diagrammatic technique .",
    "the diagram describing the long - range correlations is shown in fig . [ figdiagram](b ) .",
    "it contains either two diffusons or two cooperons.@xcite the two - diffuson diagram describes the process in which the particles move in the same direction within the two joint routes , while the two - cooperon diagram corresponds to the motion of particles in the opposite directions .",
    "the cooperon ( diffuson ) as the element of the diagram describes the process of coherent scattering of electrons moving along the joint routes .",
    "the blocks of three green s functions ( two retarded and one advanced , or vice versa ) are known as the hikami boxes .",
    "they describe the incoherent motion of electrons in the domains close to the entry and exit points @xmath3 and @xmath5 , where their routes divaricate .",
    "recently , stm measurements of the ldos spatial variations have emerged as a new powerful tool to characterize intrinsic inhomogeneities in impure superconductors.@xcite these measurements revealed both rapid oscillations with typical wave vectors connecting characteristic points at the fermi surface ( the quasi - particle scattering interference patterns ) and smooth ldos variations . in particular , studying the oscillating contribution provides one of the ways to establish the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter . the available theoretical description of these experiments is mostly based on the single - impurity approximation @xcite , which becomes insufficient at noticeable impurity concentration .",
    "our purpose in this article is to understand the behavior of inhomogeneous ldos of impure superconductors with different order parameter symmetries at the length scales beyond the mean free path .",
    "we develop a theory which properly accounts for the collective effects appearing during coherent quasiparticle scattering on impurities .",
    "we demonstrate that the energy dependence of the long - range correlation function of superconductor is indeed sensitive to symmetry of the order parameter and nature of scatterers .",
    "the inhomogeneous ldos of superconductor can be directly mapped on that one of a normal metal only in the simplest case of s - wave superconductor with elastic scatterers .",
    "presence of magnetic impurities or more nontrivial symmetry of the order parameter results in the considerable complication of the ldos correlation function energy dependence while the spatial variations in all cases do not change .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we start our discussion introducing the green s function formalism for study of the inhomogeneous ldos correlation function and refresh to a reader its properties in normal metal .",
    "section iii is devoted to study of the ldos correlation function in s - wave superconductors and it consists of two subsections treating cases with only elastic and both elastic and magnetic impurities . in section",
    "iv we consider the problem in the case of superconductor with d - wave symmetry of the order parameter and elastic impurities .",
