    "the first notion of fractional excitations in condensed matter physics goes back to the appearance of soliton mid - gap modes in polyacetylene  @xcite , where the effective net charge of one kink excitation is @xmath0 , one half of the electron charge . at a similar time , the field of fractional statistics , founded in the work by leinaas and myrheim  @xcite , attained broad attention due to the work by wilczek in 1982  @xcite . in strongly - correlated many - body systems ,",
    "the phenomenon of fractionalization , where the elementary excitations of the system carry only a fraction of the quantum numbers of the constituents , has become known to occur in a variety of cases .",
    "the first physical system in which fractional excitations and the associated fractional statistics have been discussed on a unified footing is the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite ( fqhe ) .",
    "there , the quantum statistics of the anyonic quasiparticles can be understood in terms of a generalized berry s phase  @xcite , which is acquired by the wave function as quasiparticles wind around each other .",
    "this is a sensible concept in two dimensions only where one can uniquely define a winding number for the braiding . in the fqhe",
    ", the fractional statistics is known to occur in the presence of a magnetic field violating parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetry . in recent years",
    ", there have been tremendous efforts to study the fractional excitations of the fqhe experimentally in order to confirm the prediction from theory and to validate fractional statistics as a concept being realized in nature .",
    "this , however , has remained inconclusive in certain aspects and thus is still a subject of current discussion and work  @xcite .",
    "later , the concept of fractional statistics has been found to occur in one - dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnets , where it can be defined in terms of a generalized pauli principle obeyed by the excitations  @xcite and , as shown recently , by a phase the wave function acquires when two spinons move through each other  @xcite .",
    "the fractional charge of the quasiparticles in the fqhe corresponds to the spin @xmath1 of the elementary spinon excitations in these systems , which is fractional as the hilbert space is built up by spin flips which carry spin @xmath2 .",
    "as one - dimensional systems are amenable to a host of exact methods , many exactly solvable models exhibiting this behavior exist  @xcite . in particular , various properties of fractional excitations in spin chains have been observed experimentally  @xcite .    in general , it appears to be that @xmath3 and @xmath4 violation is intimately related to the occurrence of excitations obeying fractional statistics in two dimensions , which both applies to quasiparticles in the fqhe and spinons in a quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "these symmetries may be explicitly broken as in the fqhe or generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking . for two - dimensional antiferromagnets ,",
    "the concept of fractional excitations is less established than for the one - dimensional case  @xcite . in particular , finding solvable theoretical models in which the phenomenon occurs has been one predominant area of research in the field .",
    "significant progress has been accomplished for dimer models  @xcite .",
    "in addition to important questions with regard to the general principle underlying fractional statistics , two - dimensional spin liquids are of special interest with regard to investigation of the hypothesized link between fractionalization and high-@xmath5 superconductivity  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "in many systems where fractionalization occurs , there is the ambition to use the topological degeneracy contained in these systems for quantum computing , where topological information can serve as a quantum bit with negligibly small local decoherence rates  @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic state for a @xmath6 spin liquid is the chiral spin liquid ( csl ) introduced by kalmeyer and laughlin  @xcite , which is constructed to spontaneously violate the symmetries @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and can be defined on any regular lattice including both bipartite and non - bipartite lattices .",
    "the universality class of chiral spin liquid states , and in particular the order parameter and the topological degeneracy  @xcite , was defined by wen , wilczek , and zee  @xcite .",
    "a csl state has also been constructed by yao and kivelson  @xcite in the kitaev model  @xcite on a fisher lattice , a honeycomb lattice of triangles .",
    "recently , a family of non - abelian csl states  @xcite has been proposed for general spin @xmath7 , whose wave functions correspond to the bosonic read - rezayi series of fqh states  @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian statistics of the spinons has even been conjectured to be a general property of spin @xmath7 antiferromagnets  @xcite .    as in the one - dimensional case mentioned above , the spinons in the csl exhibit quantum - number fractionalization and carry only half the spin of the bosonic spin excitations in conventional magnetically - ordered systems , which carry spin  @xmath2 . whereas the spinon appears to be the fundamental field describing excitations in two - dimensional @xmath6 antiferromagnets in general , an effective description by magnon - like excitations proved rather adequate for the generic model .",
    "the reason for this is that the confinement between the spinons is generically so strong that the underlying excitation structure is mostly suppressed . in the csl",
    ", however , the spinons are deconfined .",
    "the model is hence ideally suited to study fractional quantization of spinons in two - dimensional antiferromagnets . in spite of its promising properties , for nearly two decades since its emergence",
    ", the csl lacked a microscopic model where it is realized .    in this article",
    ", we develop an analytical method for the construction of parent hamiltonians for the csl .",
    "the method relies explicitly on the singlet property of the csl , as this allows for a spherical tensor decomposition of the destruction operator we introduce . from different tensor components , we construct two different parent hamiltonians , which annihilate the csl and",
    "hence have it as a zero - energy ground state .",
    "one of the hamiltonians has been presented in a letter previously  @xcite ; both hamiltonians contain 6-body interactions .",
    "one of the key issues we address here is whether the csl is the _ only _ ground state of these hamiltonians . to answer this question",
    ", we perform exact diagonalization studies of both models for a 16-site square lattice . in particular , we introduce an adapted kernel sweeping method , which allows for an efficient numerical implementation of the complex and technically cumbersome hamiltonians we investigate .",
    "we find that the model we introduced previously has indeed the csl as its ( modulo the two - fold topological degeneracy ) unique ground state .",
    "for the other hamiltonian we present , however , we find that the csl is not the unique ground state .",
    "hence only the former model is useful for further analysis of the spinon spectrum .",

    "we formulate a destruction operator for the csl state in section  [ sec : destruction ] and exploit the spin rotational invariance of the csl state to decompose the destruction operator into its spherical tensor components , which annihilate the csl state individually . the proof that the destruction operator annihilates the csl ground state is given in section  [ sec : proof ] . in section  [ sec : kernelsweeping ] , we introduce a kernel sweeping method to compute the csl hamiltonians .",
    "we present the method in detail and emphasize its applicability to efficiently compute @xmath8-body interactions for finite - size exact diagonalization studies .",
