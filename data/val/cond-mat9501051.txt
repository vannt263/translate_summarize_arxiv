    "polymer networks often provide highly specialized elastic properties to biological systems .",
    "structure of the red blood cell ( rbc ) membrane is typical in this respect @xcite in the sense that it unites the lipid matrix and the ( polymer ) spectrin network into a single `` dressed '' membrane , where the polymer network not only interacts with the underlying lipid surface but is actually anchored to it _ via _ ankyrin molecules .",
    "the polymer network consists of negatively charged spectrin tetramers of @xmath0 nm contour length , with intrinsic persistence length of @xmath1 nm .",
    "the replicating network of spectrin tetramers has a junction functionality of between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the network junctions do not coincide with attachment points ( ankyrin molecules ) .",
    "the contour length of the spectrin tetramers is between @xmath4 times larger then the separation between anchoring points and the whole system thus looks like a crosslinked two dimensional gel where the crosslinks are bound to remain on the supporting lipid surface while the polymers are allowed to stretch into the cytoplasmic ( polymer rich ) solution and away from the lipid surface @xcite .",
    "the problem of elastic properties of a `` dressed '' membrane , where the individual polymer molecules or their junctions are confined to lie on ( or are embedded in ) the supporting surface , motivated by our present understanding of the rbc spectrin network , received recently a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "the method of choice in most of these investigations has been the monte carlo simulations that led to several important insights regarding surface - tethered polymers and/or surface polymer networks .",
    "the analytical limits for these systems have been much harder to come by due to the complicated nature of the polymer network - surface interactions . in this paper",
    "we shall try to fill this gap and establish some approximate limiting analytical results for the elastic properties of a surface polymer network pinned to a supporting flexible membrane surface .",
    "more specifically we shall investigate the modifications in the elastic energy parameters of a flexible membrane wrought by the presence of a surface polymer gel where the crosslinks ( in this case presumed to be sliplinks ) are constrained to lie on the supporting membrane surface .",
    "the parts of the polymeric chains between the junctions are allowed to sample all the configurations on one side of the supporting membrane , _",
    "i.e. _ are constrained to lie in the halfspace defined by the position of the membrane surface ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "several theoretical studies lately addressed the issues pertaining to the modifications of elastic properties of a membrane in contact with a polymer solution that interacts with it @xcite .",
    "though the problem in this case is simpler than in the surface polymer gel case , it appears that certain features of the approach employed @xcite can be generalized to this case .",
    "specifically we shall derive the curvature expansion of the free energy of a surface polymer gel with deformed supporting surface and show that the spontaneous curvature as well as the elastic modulus of the `` dressed '' membrane become functions of the polymer parameters , most notably the monomer - surface interaction and the polymer bulk end - end separation .",
    "we presume that the chains in between the junctions are gaussian and that their interaction with the supporting membrane surface , aside from the sliplinks where they are pinned to the surface , is of a contact type , thus simulating the screened electrostatic or other short range interactions between polymer segments and the membrane surface ( see fig.1 ) . the proposed formulation of the surface gel on a non - planar supporting surface problem is closely related to the formulation of similar polymer problems in the bulk introduced by edwards and freed @xcite and is particularly suited for the application of the balian - bloch - duplantier @xcite multiple surface scattering green function formalism , which gives a local curvature expansion for a helmholtz equation in a region with deformed boundaries .",
    "a major drawback of this approach is that we have been unable to include volume interactions between polymer chains , extensively studied in @xcite , into the formulation in a consistent manner .",
    "however , this drawback is substantially counterbalanced by the fact that first of all analytic results are feasible in this approximation and that the effect of even very complicated polymer - surface interactions , as is the case in this model system , can be readily investigated within the developed formalism .",
    "we define our system as a statistical ensemble of freely mobile sliplinks confined to the supporting surface @xmath5 ( here and below the greek indices stand for coordinates along the supporting surface ) produced after @xmath6 chains @xmath7 monomers long are crosslinked @xmath8 times with functionality four .",
    "following @xcite the crosslinks are taken to be introduced by an external auxiliary field , @xmath9 , that produces polymer chains with green function @xmath10 if the chains are @xmath11 segments long .",
    "one can show through a diagrammatic expansion of this green function that if it is averaged over a gaussian distribution of @xmath9 this operation formally introduces an arbitrary number of cross - links of functionality four , distributed randomly through space and along the chains , with the partition function @xmath12 for @xmath6 chains .",
    "if one now expands the green function in terms of @xmath13 and then averages with @xmath14 , the coefficient of @xmath15 contains all the terms with @xmath8 crosslinks randomly distributed across the space and along the chains .",
    "thus the partition function of a system with @xmath8 crosslinks can be formally written as @xmath16    for the system discussed here the partition function can be obtained along the lines of @xcite , except that the auxiliary field should now be confined to the surface @xmath5 .",
    "this would signify that it should effect not the equation defining the green function itself , but rather its boundary condition at this surface .",
    "also if there exist other interactions between the polymers and the surface , they should also show up only in the boundary condition if their range is short enough .",
    "putting now everything together we derive the partition function of our model system in the following compact notation @xmath17^n \\right>_{\\phi } = { { m!}\\over{2\\pi \\imath } } \\oint_{\\cal c } { { d\\mu}\\over{\\mu^{m+1 } } } \\left < \\xi_{\\phi } ( \\mu , { \\cal n})^n \\right>_{\\phi } ,   \\label{equ1}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the laplace transformed green function of a free flight polymer , satisfying a helmholtz - type equation @xcite @xmath19{\\cal g}_{\\phi}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}';s ) = -\\delta^3 ( { \\bf r } - { \\bf r } ' ) .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath24 and the definition of @xmath25 is obvious . at the supporting membrane surface @xmath5",
    "the green function satisfies @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the strength of the contact membrane surface - polymer interaction",
    ". it can be either repulsive ( @xmath28 ) or attractive ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the last term in the above equation , proportional to @xmath30 , creates at random positions along the supporting surface @xmath5 as well as along the polymer chains junctions of fourfold functionality ( sliplinks ) , of chemical potential @xmath31 per single junction , after the green function is averaged over a gaussian distribution of the auxiliary field @xmath32 @xcite , @xmath33 the averaging over a gaussian distribution of the auxiliary field preserves only terms with even powers of @xmath30 .",
    "we shall now try to obtain an approximate solution of the above model in the limit of @xmath34 while separately @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with the additional proviso that the volume ( or surface ) density of chains @xmath37 depending on the sign of @xmath38 and the surface density of sliplinks @xmath39 are finite ( thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "we first of all cast the model in a form that will be appropriate for later formal developements .",
    "it is easiest to obtain a power series solution of eq.[equ3 ] in terms of the free space solution @xmath40 _ i.e. _ @xmath41 this series has been already derived by balian and bloch in @xcite and we merely quote their result . introducing @xmath42",
    "as @xmath43 one obtains the following expansion for the green function @xmath44 where @xmath45 we might just add here that for a planar surface the normal derivative of the green function , @xmath46 , is zero and thus the expansion eq.[balian ] is basically an expansion in the curvature of the bounding surface .",
    "combining now both eqs.[equ10 ] and [ balian ] we can derive the partition function in a rather transparent form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the volume of the polymer solution with unperturbed boundaries and the operator @xmath49 is obtained as a solution of @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the area element of the surface @xmath52 , and @xmath53 eqs.[equ5 ] and [ equ6 ] represent just a more compact formalisation of the results already derived in @xcite that is conveniently suited for our purposes .",
    "formally the above equations define our model system .",
    "their solution is obviously non - trivial and additional approximations have to be introduced in order to make the problem tractable .",
    "first of all we shall introduce the approxiation of low polymer density that will make the evaluation of @xmath54 average tractable in the form of a power series in the chemical potential of the sliplinks , @xmath31 . next we shall resolve the integration over @xmath31 by reverting to the saddle - point _",
    "ansatz _ and finally we shall use the approximation of the local tangential plane that explicitely introduces the surface curvature dependence of the different green functions to evaluate the different curvature terms in the final expression for the partition function .",
    "starting from eq.[equ5 ] , @xmath55 can be written in the form of a `` virial '' expansion in terms of the polymer volume density . if this density is small enough we can stop at the first order term thus obtaining @xmath56    as we have done before @xcite we now substantially reduce the heavy algebra proceeding from the above equations if we presume that @xmath57 .",
    "first of all we solve eq.[equ6 ] in the form of a formal series in @xmath58 . this series solution of eq.[equ6 ] for @xmath59 can be effectively resummed and averaged over the gaussian distribution of the auxiliary field @xmath60 eq.[equ4 ] .",
    "only even powers of @xmath58 survive this averaging and we can regroup the remaining terms obtaining a power series in @xmath31 . by defining @xmath61",
    "we thus obtain the @xmath62 average of @xmath63 in the form of a series in the chemical potential of the pinning sliplinks @xmath31 @xmath64 where we redefined the chemical potential @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "this relation stemms from the conservation of the degrees of freedom of the chain @xcite . at each order of the @xmath31 expansion",
    "we retain only the largest term while omitting all the additional powers of @xmath67 .",
    "the above expansion in terms of @xmath31 is convergent if @xmath34 , and we can stop at the second order term .",
    "the zero order term in this expansion , eq.[equ8 ] , is exactly the one corresponding to the example treated previously @xcite , which corresponds to the case without any surface pinning of the polymers through the sliplinks .    the approximate form of @xmath68 is thus obtained as @xmath69 where aside from @xmath70 all the other @xmath31 terms in the expansion can be obtained by comparison with eq.[equ8 ] as @xmath71 \\nonumber\\\\ \\xi_1({\\cal n } ) & = & 8~{\\cal l}^{-1}\\left [ { \\rm tr } \\int ds_{\\gamma } \\delta ( { \\bf r}_{\\alpha},{\\bf r}_{\\gamma};s ) w_0 ( { \\bf r}_{\\gamma},{\\bf r}_{\\beta};s ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\xi_2({\\cal n } ) & = & 64~{\\cal l}^{-1}\\left [ { \\rm tr } \\int\\!\\!\\int ds_{\\gamma}ds_{\\epsilon } \\delta ( { \\bf r}_{\\alpha},{\\bf r}_{\\gamma};s ) \\delta ( { \\bf r}_{\\gamma},{\\bf r}_{\\epsilon};s ) w_0 ( { \\bf r}_{\\epsilon},{\\bf r}_{\\beta};s ) \\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ ~ \\label{equxi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 = v$ ] .",
    "the final @xmath31 integration in eq.[equ7b ] is now of the form @xmath73 which is amenable to an analytic treatment through the saddle - point approximation in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath35 and @xmath74 , yielding an approximate result @xmath75 , where to the lowest order we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "the saddle - point free energy @xmath77 is thus obtained as ( @xmath78 ) @xmath79    following the expansion of the statistical sum in terms of the relative number of sliplinks , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath80 , we now additionally presume that the supporting surface @xmath5 is deformed and we investigate the lowest order expansion of the free energy in terms of the local curvatures of the deformed surface .",
    "we approach this problem by the balian - bloch - duplantier method @xcite as was explained in detail for a somewhat simpler case of polymer - surface interactions @xcite .",
    "the principle of the curvature expansion is simple .",
    "first of all we note that the partition function eq.[equxi ] contains different surface integrals of either @xmath81 , @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "since all these quantities depend only on the difference of the surface coordinates in the arguments we can expand them around the local tangential plane up to the second order in the deviations from that plane and then evaluate the surface integrals explicitely .",
    "this expansion in terms of the deviations from the local tangential plane is valid only as long as the green function is of a range smaller than the local curvatures .",
    "practically this would mean that one can always find a range of curvature values where the expansion of a yukawa - type green function eq.[green ] in the vicinity of a local tangential plane of a non - planar surface is justified .",
    "we write the equation of the bounding surface @xmath5 in the reference frame of the tangential plane at @xmath84 as @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the two principal radii of curvature at the point @xmath84 on the bounding surface .",
    "we can now straightforwardly derive the form of the curvature dependence up to and including second order of the green function by expanding the coordinate dependence in the vicinity of tangential plane for each point along the bounding surface .",
    "the only non - zero terms in the expansion of @xmath81 are the zero and the second order , thus giving @xmath88 where the superscript @xmath89 stands for planar ( i.e. zero curvature ) approximation of the superscripted quantity .",
    "furthermore @xmath90 obviously has only odd terms in the expansion starting with @xmath91 since the local normal is defined as @xmath92 .",
    "the third origin of the curvature dependence is the surface area element @xmath51 itself in eqs.[equ10 ] and [ equ9 ] @xmath93 finally expressions eqs.[equtop ] , [ equbot ] and [ equzad ] have to be averaged locally over all the directions of the principal curvature axes .",
    "these fundamental dependencies of the green function @xmath81 and its normal derivative on the local curvature now generate the corresponding functional dependence for the surface green function @xmath94 through the defining equation eq.[equ10 ] and for @xmath95 that can be written in an alternative form @xmath96 \\nonumber\\\\ ~ \\label{equtra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the curvature dependence transpires more directly . with all these provisos",
    "we can now evaluate the surface integrals in the defining equations eq.[equ9 ] explicitely order by order in the inverse curvature @xcite . though this procedure is tedious",
    "it is nevertheless straightforward .",

    "it is clear that the fourth term in the free energy eq.[equ16 ] corresponds to the statistically averaged contact excluded volume interaction of the polymer solution with the deformed boundary , as the limit @xmath120 assumed in deriving this result essentially reduces to the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "we shall referr to this term in the free energy as the contact term .",
    "the term linear in @xmath39 is the only one that vanishes completely for a flat surface and is formally analogous to an effective polymer adsorption term @xcite .",
    "as it is non - zero only for a rough surface it stemms from the `` in plane bridging '' ( see ref.@xcite ) provided by the segments of the polymers between different sliplinks .",
    "obviously it tends to curve the surface towards the polymer rich side and thus acts in opposition to the contact term .",
    "the last term in eq.[equ16 ] , being of the second order in @xmath39 , corresponds to the free energy of chain segments caught by the sliplinks and thus brought in the immediate vicinity of the repulsive surface .",
    "its zero and first order curvature terms are both negative , reflecting the predominant influence of the deminished entropy over the interaction energy ( @xmath121 per link ) of the chains meeting at the sliplink confined to the supporting surface .",
    "this term acts to expose a larger area to the polymer rich side , thus tending to curve the supporting surface away from it in concert with the contact term .",
    "it is also the only term in the energy expansion that does not effect the curvature modulus at all .",
    "the final rescaling of the curvature modulus and spontaneous curvature in this limit then assume the form @xmath122 and @xmath123 where we introduced the radius of gyration , which in appropriate units assumes the form @xmath124 and the volume density of polymers @xmath125 .",
    "the free energy of the system in the limit of @xmath126 thus emerges as being composed of three decoupled terms : the surface energy of the bulk polymer solution due to the repulsive interaction of the polymers with the surface , the energy of those polymer chains that happen to join different sliplinks and lie in the plane of the unperturbed surface , and the surface energy of sliplinks themselves , since at the points of crosslinking different segments of the chains make contact with the ( repulsive ) surface . after relaxing the limit",
    "@xmath34 we can presume , that only the last two mechanisms will remain in making a substantial contribution to the total free energy .",
    "unfortunately the relaxing of this limit makes the whole calculation much more demanding , probably due to the fact that the system goes through a surface gelation transition .    in the case of attractive interactions between the chains and the surface",
    "the third term corresponds to the free energy of a polymer bound to a deformed surface with energy @xmath27 per surface area .",
    "the first term in the parenthesis is simply the adsorption energy @xcite . the term linear in curvature preferrs bending towards the polymer rich side and thus acts exactly in the opposite direction as the analogous term in the contact term eq.[equ16 ] .",
    "this is also the only term in the whole free energy expression that is linear in curvature .",
    "the rescaling of the curvature modulus obviously stemms in this case from three different mechanisms which interestingly enough all act in the direction of destabilizing the curvature modulus .",
    "the first contribution , being linear in @xmath127 comes from the adsorption energy and is of the same form as in the case when no pinning to sliplinks is present @xcite .",
    "the second and third contributions , being linear and quadratic in @xmath128 respectively , are obviously due to the presence of surface - bound sliplinks .",
    "the linear term is due to the energy difference in the pinning at the sliplink as compared to the soft adsorption while the third term is due to the energy difference of an adsorbed portion of the chain when it is pinned by two sliplinks , at the beginning and at the end , and when it is softly adsorbed .",
    "the modifications in the gaussian modulus are important because they extend only over the area occupied by polymers and are thus position dependent ( otherwise they would make no contribution to the equations determining the shape of the `` dressed '' membrane ) . in the case of repulsive polymer - membrane interactions , _",

    "the gaussian curvature modulus has a very simple dependence on the polymer parameters @xmath132 that in conjunction with eq.[prut ] favours the proliferation of handles .",

    "<S> a microscopic model of a surface polymer network - membrane system is introduced , with contact polymer surface interactions that can be either repulsive or attractive and sliplinks of functionality four randomly distributed over the supporting membrane surface anchoring the polymers to it . for the supporting surface perturbed from a planar configuration and a small relative number of surface sliplinks , we investigate an expansion of the free energy in terms of the local curvatures of the surface and the surface density of sliplinks , obtained through the application of the balian - bloch - duplantier multiple surface scattering method . as a result , the dependence of the curvature elastic modulus , the gaussian modulus as well as of the spontaneous curvature of the `` dressed '' membrane ,  _ i.e. _ polymer network plus membrane matrix , is obtained on the mean polymer bulk end to end separation and the surface density of sliplinks .    0.5 cm    pacs . </S>",
