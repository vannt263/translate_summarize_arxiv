    "the exotic @xmath1 baryon , after its first discovery @xcite and confirmations in subsequent experiments @xcite , has brought huge excitements in hadron physics .",
    "it is a narrow resonance containing 5 quarks , @xmath4 , that has not been observed before .",
    "though not confirmed , it is believed to be an isoscalar with spin @xmath5 , forming a flavor @xmath6 .",
    "na49 collaboration @xcite later reported the observation of the narrow resonance , @xmath7 , which could be another member of the same multiplet @xmath6 .",
    "the observation of the anti - charmed pentaquark @xmath8 in the @xmath9 invariance mass spectrum has been recently reported by h1 collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "it is anti - charmed analogue of the @xmath1 and has the quark content @xmath10 .",
    "the pentaquark with one heavy anti - quark was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in a quark model .",
    "then it has been studied in quark models @xcite and skyrme models @xcite and attracts recent interests  @xcite motivated by the current experimental activities .",
    "thus , the pentaquarks are becoming a solid member in hadron spectroscopy and await a systematic compilation of their properties .",
    "one interesting model for the pentaquark is the diquark - diquark - antiquark picture of jaffe and wilczek ( jw ) @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "@xmath1 is composed by the constituent quarks , @xmath11-@xmath11-@xmath12 .",
    "the two diquarks @xmath11-@xmath11 are identical and the boson symmetry restricts them to be in a relative @xmath13-wave .",
    "thus , the two diquarks combined with an @xmath14-wave antiquark lead to even parity for @xmath2 .",
    "the positive parity is also supported by the triquark - diquark picture @xcite , the soliton model prediction @xcite , the quark potential model calculations @xcite and quenched lattice calculation @xcite . however , dynamical calculations based on qcd sum rules @xcite or lattice calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite support the negative parity of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 parity is an important issue to be settled and should be determined eventually from reaction mechanisms . indeed , various reactions have been suggested to determine the @xmath2 parity .",
    "several proposals are based on the order of magnitude of cross sections and polarization observables in the reactions including @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19  @xcite .    among various qcd sum rule calculations for @xmath2 @xcite ,",
    "the approach proposed by sugiyama , doi and oka ( sdo ) @xcite is particularly interesting . here",
    ", the interpolating field for @xmath2 is constructed by mostly following the jw picture except for the fact that all the quarks are placed locally .",
    "the same current has been used in the lattice calculation @xcite . since qcd sum rules deal with _ current quarks _ , one can certainly form two different diquarks ( with opposite parity ) from the @xmath11 system and the boson symmetry no longer applies to the two - diquark system .",
    "nevertheless , the two - diquark system still has odd parity as in the jw picture .",
    "the qcd sum rule of sdo has some interesting features . in the operator product expansion ( ope ) , each diquark propagates only to the diquark and the two diquarks with different parities do not mix each other .",
    "this feature is quite welcomed because the diquarks are expected to be a tightly bound system and hence they may not be easy to diffuse to the others in their propagations .",
    "the @xmath2 properties in the sdo sum rule are mainly determined by the nonperturbative effects coming from the anti - strange quark .",
    "in particular , the negative parity , which is opposite to the jw prediction , is mainly driven by the quark - gluon mixed condensate , @xmath20 , which is proportional to the average quark virtuality in the qcd vacuum . when the quark mass becomes heavier ( like in the constituent quark picture ) , such a virtuality should become smaller and it may be possible to flip the parity .    thus , the extension to the charmed analogue @xmath0 provides an interesting test for the sdo sum rule and lattice calculations @xcite . here , the charm quark is quite heavy so that the constituent - quark picture may fit well and the jw prediction for the parity is expected to be reproduced from qcd .",
    "in fact , quenched lattice calculation finds the parity of @xmath0 to be positive @xcite . in the extension to the @xmath0 sum rules ,",
    "there are two important aspects , which make this sum rule different from the sdo sum rule .",
    "first of all , since the charm quark is too heavy to form quark condensate , it gives non - perturbative effects only by radiating gluons .",
    "the quark - gluon mixed condensate @xmath20 , which was the important contribution in the @xmath2 sum rule , is replaced by gluonic operators in the heavy quark expansion that are normally suppressed . secondly , the charm quark mass has to be kept finite in the ope , which can be done by using the momentum space expression for the charm - quark propagator .",
    "this is different from the light - quark sum rule where the calculation is performed in the coordinate space and all the quark propagators are obtained based on the expansion with the small quark mass .",
    "keeping these two aspects in mind , we construct qcd sum rules for @xmath0 and see how they are different from the @xmath1 sum rule .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the interpolating field for the @xmath3 and show that it transforms properly under parity .",
    "section iii gives the phenomenological side and section iv gives the ope side .",
    "the qcd sum rules for @xmath3 and their analysis are given in section v.",
    "in our sum rules , we use the following interpolating field for @xmath3 , @xmath22 here roman indices @xmath23 are color indices , @xmath24 denotes charge conjugation , @xmath25 transpose .",
    "note that we have introduced the @xmath26 matrix @xmath27 in front of the antiquark , which is to be determined from parity consideration below .",
    "the @xmath28 satisfies the charge - conjugated dirac equation and represents the anti - charm quark .",
    "the diquarks , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are isoscalar with spin 0 . due to the @xmath31 difference ,",
    "the two diquarks have opposite parities . to make a local interpolating field ,",
    "all the quarks are defined at the same space - time .    to determine @xmath27",
    ", we consider the parity transformation of @xmath3 , @xmath32 this parity transformation must be recovered when each quark ( and the antiquark ) in @xmath3 transforms similarly , namely @xmath33 this constraint in fact leads to the usual nucleon interpolating field @xcite commonly used in nucleon qcd sum rules . under this quark transformation ,",
    "the two diquarks transform @xmath34 the anti - quark is transformed accordingly as @xmath35 substituting these into the interpolating field eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) and demanding the consistency with eq .",
    "( [ parity ] ) , we find @xmath36 . this type of interpolating field with @xmath37 has been used to investigate the properties of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules for the @xmath3 are constructed from the following correlation function , @xmath38 where eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) with @xmath36 is used as the interpolating field . to construct the phenomenological side",
    ", we note that the @xmath3 interpolating field can couple to both parities @xcite . for the positive parity state , the interpolating field couples through @xmath39 while for the negative parity , it couples through @xmath40 here , @xmath41 denotes the coupling strength between the interpolating field and the physical state with the specified parity . using this",
    ", we obtain the phenomenological side of eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) separated into chiral even and odd parts , @xmath42 where the plus ( minus ) sign in front of @xmath43 is for positive ( negative ) parity .",
    "the dots denote higher resonance contributions that should be parametrized according to qcd duality .",
    "it should be noted however that higher resonances with different parities contribute differently to the chiral - even and chiral odd parts @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath44 and @xmath45 constitute separate sum rules .",
    "the spectral density is given by @xmath46 we notice that the chiral - odd part has opposite sign depending on the parity while the chiral even part has positive - definite coefficient .",
    "thus , the chiral - odd part from the ope side can determine the parity .",
    "in the ope side , we calculate the five diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . to keep the charm quark mass finite",
    ", we use the momentum - space expression for the charm quark propagators . for the light quark part of the correlation function , we calculate in the coordinate - space , which is then fourier - transformed to the momentum space in @xmath47-dimension .",

    "the values for the quark and gluon condensates are rather standard in baryon or meson sum rules . for the charm quark mass",
    ", other values can be found in the literature , 1.1 gev for its running mass and 1.5 gev for the pole mass  @xcite .",
    "these fit the open charm mass @xmath66 in the sum rule of pseudoscalar correlator .",

    "( [ even ] ) is consistently positive .",
    "our result in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) indeed shows that the rhs satisfies this constraint . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , we plot the rhs of the chiral - odd sum rule ( [ odd ] ) . here , we see that the rhs is positive suggesting that the parity of @xmath3 is positive .",
    "this positive parity agrees with the quenched lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "the two observations do not change as we vary the continuum threshold from @xmath67 to 3.6 gev .",
    "the main contribution from the ope is from the perturbative part [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] and the gluon condensate coming from the light quark [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "the contribution from @xmath70 and @xmath52 is found to be small and therefore the uncertainties in these parameters affect the result marginally .",
    "other values for @xmath54 ranging from 1.1 gev to 1.5 gev are found to yield somewhat different curves but all of them have the same sign again supporting the positive parity .",
    "our result favoring the positive parity is consistent with the expectation from the constituent quark model picture with diquark correlations by jaffe and wilczek  @xcite .",
    "namely , in the jaffe - wilczek picture , the two - diquark system has negative parity and , combining with the anticharm quark with intrinsic negative parity , the pentaquark has the positive parity in total .",
    "note , in the sdo sum rule for @xmath2 @xcite , this picture was not met by the large contribution from the quark - gluon mixed condensate , @xmath20 , which is proportional to the quark virtuality .",
    "this mixed condensate is now replaced by fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) through the heavy quark expansion , whose contribution to the ope becomes marginal in our @xmath3 sum rule .",
    "this constitutes the main mechanism for yielding positive parity in this heavy - light pentaquark system .",
    "therefore , we have an interesting crossover from the strange sector to the charm sector in the pentaquark parity .      1 .",
    "we take derivative of the chiral even sum rule ( [ even ] ) with respect to @xmath71 and divide the resulting equation by eq .",
    "( [ even ] ) . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ even ] ) , this step leads to @xmath72 in the lhs . the mass is then obtained by taking negative square root of the resulting rhs .",
    "2 .   the same method as 1 applied to the chiral - odd sum rule , eq . ( [ odd ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the two cases . at the continuum threshold",
    "@xmath73 gev , both sum rules yield the @xmath3 mass to be around 3.06 gev and the result is practically independent of the borel mass @xmath74 . changing the charm quark mass to a lower value of 1.1",
    "gev leads to 3.02 gev . for a much higher value of @xmath75 gev , we have 3.14 gev at the stable borel region .",
    "so the extracted mass is slightly sensitive to the charm quark mass .",
    "the extracted mass is more sensitive to the continuum threshold .",
    "as we increase the continuum threshold , the result increases slightly also . at the large threshold of @xmath76 gev",
    ", the predicted mass is around 3.4 gev .",
    "thus , our sum rules give the @xmath3 mass that qualitatively agrees with the experimental value of 3.099 gev .",
    "to summarize , we have constructed qcd sum rules for the recently discovered anti - charmed pentaquark @xmath0 .",
    "the charm quark mass is kept finite in the ope while for the light quark propagators we use the coordinate space expressions obtained from the expansion in the small quark mass .",
    "our sum rules suggest that the parity of @xmath3 is positive , which is opposite to that of @xmath1 determined from qcd sum rules .",
