    "in order to satisfy the rapidly increasing demands on higher network performance , e.g. , in terms of higher quality - of - experience ( qoe ) @xcite , quality - of - service ( qos ) @xcite , and greater mobile data traffic @xcite , wireless communications using @xmath0 ghz radio ( often referred to as millimeter wave : mmwave communication system ) is proposed as a promising alternative to the existing lower band ( around 2 ghz ) communication . to date , there have been several academic and industrial bodies participating in the standardization of mmwave technology , e.g. , ieee 802.11ad task group , ieee 802.15.3 task group 3c , and wireless gigabit alliance ( wigig ) .",
    "there are also numerous efforts in academia that are dedicated to network design and related applications for the next generation wireless communications . however , due to the severe path loss and high oxygen absorption effect in the @xmath0 ghz radios @xcite , it is not yet clear if such networks can meet the desired delay and reliability requirements . furthermore , performance evaluations for the @xmath0 ghz wireless networks are of great importance in the system design , optimization and implementation , if the performance requirements , by the end users , are to be guaranteed . unfortunately , the traditional performance analysis methodologies , e.g. , classical queuing theory , may not be useful in analysing such networks unless some conformity assumptions on the arrival and service process are enforced .",
    "such assumptions may jeopardize the integrity of the obtained results in reference to the real system .",
    "to date , most of related study regarding the performance of @xmath0 ghz wireless networks departs from the perspective of physical layer ( phy ) , where a series of phy techniques , e.g. , signal modulation , channel coding and beamforming , were discussed @xcite .",
    "however , a network layer delay and backlog analysis of @xmath0 ghz wireless communications in terms of the channel parameters , which is crucial in evaluating the performance of qoe- or qos - driven wireless communications , does not exist .",
    "this motivates us to develop an analytical model and methodology to analyze the performance of such networks .",
    "we propose an alternative and more suitable methodology to analyze the performance of 60 ghz networks based on a network calculus approach .",
    "this approach was originally proposed by cruz @xcite for worst - case analysis of deterministic networked systems .",
    "network calculus is a system theoretic approach for the analysis of communication networks , where the network operation is described using the @xmath1  algebra .",
    "a network service element , e.g. , a wired or wireless link , is modelled as a @xmath1  linear , time - invariant ( lti ) system and the input / output relationship is governed by the lti system theory in the @xmath1  algebra . meanwhile",
    ", the original theory for deterministic systems analysis has been extended to probabilistic settings in order to model and analyze stochastic networks @xcite .",
    "one approach to extend network calculus to stochastic settings is the mgf - based network calculus that was proposed by @xcite which extends initial results regarding the mgf arrival and service curves suggested in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a wireless network calculus based on the @xmath2  algebra was proposed @xcite . in this approach , in order to simplify an otherwise intractable analysis , the network model is transferred into an alternative analysis domain ( referred to as snr domain ) by using the exponential function .",
    "probabilistic end - to - end performance bounds are provided for homogeneous multi - hop channels and numerical results for the case of multi - hop rayleigh fading channels is presented .    the mgf - based network calculus @xcite was originally developed to enable the modelling of the multiplexing gain of many independent stochastic flows .",
    "it was later used in the analysis of wireless systems by characterising the system s service process in terms of the mgf of a markov channel model of the wireless link @xcite .",
    "although network calculus has been around for some years , its applications to wireless networks are fairly recent , and the investigated scenarios are limited to rayleigh fading channels .",
    "in contrast to the existing work on analyzing the performance of wireless networks , the @xmath0 ghz radio channel present several challenges .",
    "first , unlike conventional wireless communications in the bands below @xmath3 ghz , which experience small - scale fading effects @xcite , the @xmath0 ghz fading channels mainly experience log - normally distributed shadowing fluctuations @xcite .",
    "second , due to the particular fading characteristic of @xmath0 ghz channels , the @xmath4  based wireless network calculus presented in @xcite is not applicable to the analysis of this network algebra in snr domain , which is transferred from the bit domain , is not feasible . ] .",
    "therefore , we opt to use the mgf - based network calculus instead .",
    "finally , the service process characterization of the 60 ghz channel , i.e. , computing the mgf of the channel capacity , is generally intractable which makes it difficult to obtain a closed - form exact solution .",
    "we use clever manipulations and bounding of the resulted expression to obtain a tractable bound on the desired service process . in this work ,",
    "we provide analytical probabilistic backlog and delay bounds for the @xmath0 ghz wireless access network .",
    "this in turn corresponds to networked applications with loss- and latency - sensitivity respectively . to do that , we first derive a simplified closed - form expression for the network service curve , in terms of the fading model and parameters of the @xmath0 ghz channel .",
    "we then evaluate the performance of the proposed model using the mgf - based network calculus approach and derive the desired probabilistic bounds .",
    "finally , we discuss the impact of a series of factors , such as arrival rate , system gain and channel fading characteristic , on network performance .",
    "our novel application of mgf - based network calculus to the analysis of 60 ghz wireless networks reveals useful insights for the network operation and the effect of different channel parameters on network performance .",
    "it also demonstrates the ability of such networks to satisfy the stringent service requirements of modern networked applications .",

    "this envelope was later extended to probabilistic settings as the @xmath33 traffic envelope @xcite , in the sense that it provides , for a given @xmath34 , a linear bound on the @xmath35 mgf of the arrival process , i.e. , @xmath36 \\le \\rho(\\theta)\\cdot ( t - s)+ \\sigma(\\theta).\\ ] ] the cumulative arrival and service processes are given in terms of their instantaneous values , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively during the @xmath39 time slot , as @xmath40 and @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",

    "the backlog @xmath49 and virtual delay @xmath50 in a first - come - first - serve ( fcfs ) scheduling system are respectively given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 where the inequalities are obtained by substituting in the above expressions and then using the definitions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in deterministic network calculus , only the worst - case upper bound is considered @xcite which result in pessimistic performance bounds that does not capture the multiplexing gain effect in packet networks .",
    "furthermore , deterministic analysis can not be used for wireless network performance analysis since @xmath53 is the only possible deterministic lower service curve due to the possibility of outage in wireless networks . the stochastic analysis on the other hand , can surpass the above limitations . in the probabilistic",

    "we first obtain a service process characterization for the 60 ghz channel based on a well accepted fading model in the literature , then apply the mgf - based network calculus to obtain the desired bounds .",
    "the @xmath0 ghz communication system can be used as an access network to provide high rate data communication for the end users .",
    "although such an application is theoretically possible , the user mobility and the line - of - sight requirement for the 60 ghz communication makes it impractical for now .",
    "alternatively , it can be used as part of a multi - hop backhaul network whenever the wired alternatives , e.g. , fibre optics , are too expensive or are not possible , perhaps due to difficult terrains and logistical issues . in such networks , the system in fig .",

    "[ sec : ii ] for he remainder of this section .",
    "the small - scale fading effect in the @xmath0 ghz communication system is negligible @xcite .",

    "many research efforts have been devoted to characterize the indoor @xmath0 ghz wireless personal area networks ( wpan ) and outdoor measurements @xcite , where a large amount of experimental results regarding this channel have been reported . in the light of above , a general expression for the channel gain ( in db ) , for either indoor or outdoor scenarios , can be summarized as @xmath75=-\\left(\\alpha + 10\\beta \\log_{10 } ( l)+\\xi\\right),\\ ] ] where , the separation distance @xmath72 is given in meters , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the least square fits of floating intercept and slope of the best fit , and @xmath78 corresponds to the log - normal shadowing effect with variance @xmath79 .    using friis free space transmission formula and the channel gain in , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , denoted by @xmath80 during time slot @xmath81 , can be expressed as @xmath82 where the constant prefactor @xmath83 represents the deterministic component of the system gain , which is determined by network configurations , including the transmit power @xmath84 , background noise power @xmath85 , antennas gains @xmath86 and @xmath87 and their separation . in this work",

    "<S> to meet the ever - increasing demands on higher throughput and better network delay performance , @xmath0  ghz networking is proposed as a promising solution for the next generation of wireless communications . to successfully deploy such networks , its important to understand their performance first . however , due to the unique fading characteristic of the @xmath0  ghz channel , the characterization of the corresponding service process , offered by the channel , using the conventional methodologies may not be tractable . in this work , we provide an alternative approach to derive a closed - form expression that characterizes the cumulative service process of the @xmath0  ghz channel in terms of the moment generating function ( mgf ) of its instantaneous channel capacity . </S>",
    "<S> we then use this expression to derive probabilistic upper bounds on the backlog and delay that are experienced by a flow traversing this network , using results from the mgf - based network calculus . </S>",
    "<S> the computed bounds are validated using simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we provide numerical results for different networking scenarios and for different traffic and channel parameters and we show that the 60 ghz wireless network is capable of satisfying stringent quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements , in terms of network delay and reliability . with this analysis approach at hand , a larger scale 60 ghz network design and optimization is possible .    @xmath0 ghz ; moment generating functions ; backlog ; delay ; upper bound . </S>"
