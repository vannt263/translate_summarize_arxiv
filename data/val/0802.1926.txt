    "codex (= cosmic dynamics experiment ) is a concept for an extremely stable , high - resolution optical spectrograph for the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) .",
    "the science case for codex encompasses a large range of topics , including the search for exo - planets down to earth - like masses , primordial nucleosynthesis and the possible variation of fundamental constants . however , its prime science driver is the exploration of the universal expansion history by detecting and measuring the cosmological redshift drift using qso absorption lines .",
    "this is also one of the 9 ` prominent ' science cases chosen by the e - elt science working group to be among the highlights of the entire e - elt science case .",
    "a description of the codex project as a whole was given by @xcite .",
    "the recognition that an ultra - stable , high - efficiency , high - resolution optical spectrograph would not only be an extremely valuable instrument for the e - elt but also for the vlt led to the development of the espresso concept (= echelle spectrograph for precision super stable observations , see l.  pasquini s contribution to these proceedings ) .",
    "again , there are a large number of applications for such an instrument , as several other contributions to these proceedings have highlighted .",
    "hence , there is also a very strong science case for espresso , including e.g.  detailed studies of the intergalactic medium and of stellar abundances .",
    "however , apart from these scientific drivers , espresso will also fulfil another role : codex will represent a major development in high - resolution optical spectrographs compared to existing instruments such as uves and harps . in order to achieve its science goals codex will have to deliver an exceptional radial velocity accuracy and stability , i.e.  @xmath0  cm  s@xmath1 over a timescale of @xmath2  yr .",
    "although the basic design concepts are already in place , several of the sub - systems needed to achieve the codex requirements do not currently exist .",
    "however , they will be implemented in espresso for the first time .",
    "hence , in many respects espresso will be a codex precursor instrument that will allow us to test and gain experience with the novel aspects of these instruments . here",
    "we will discuss espresso in the context of its codex precursor role , both in a technical sense as well as with respect to the main codex science driver , which we briefly describe next .",
    "the discovery from type ia sne that the universal hubble expansion appears to have begun accelerating at a relatively recent epoch , and its profound implications for fundamental physics have sparked an intense interest in the observational exploration of the universe s expansion history .",
    "several methods for measuring the hubble parameter @xmath3 already exist but all of them are either geometric in nature or use the dynamics of localised density perturbations .",
    "the simplest , cleanest and most direct method of determining the expansion history , however , is to observe the dynamics of the global robertson - walker metric itself .",
    "one way to achieve this is by measuring the so - called redshift drift , i.e.  the tiny , systematic drift as a function of time in the redshifts of cosmologically distant sources ( fig.[vdot ] ) .",
    "this effect is directly caused by the de- or acceleration of the universal expansion and can hence be used to determine its history .",
    "a measurement of this effect would be able to provide evidence of the acceleration that is entirely independent of the snia results or any other cosmological observations , and that does not require any cosmological or astrophysical assumptions at all .",
    "it would also provide @xmath3 measurements over a redshift range inaccessible by other methods .",
    "recently , @xcite found that a @xmath4-m telescope would indeed have the photon collecting power to detect the redshift drift by monitoring the redshifts of qso absorption lines over a timescale of @xmath2 years ( fig .",
    "[ vdot ] ) , providing a strong motivation for a codex - like instrument at the e - elt .",
    "the uves and harps experiences have allowed us to identify a number of properties that a spectrograph must feature in order to deliver exceptional radial velocity accuracy and long - term stability , including : simultaneous wavelength calibration , a fully passive instrument with zero human access , located inside a vacuum tank which is itself located inside a nested environment in an underground facility that allows progressively more precise temperature and pressure control , and the flux - weighted timing of observations with sub - second precision .",
    "temperature control of the ccd will be particularly important , while high system throughput will also be of the essence .",
    "some of these concepts are already established .",
    "however , two of the most critical aspects are also those requiring the most r&d : light scrambling and wavelength calibration .    at a resolution of @xmath5 a typical pointing accuracy of @xmath6  arcsec corresponds to an error of @xmath7  m  s@xmath1 necessitating a scrambling gain of @xmath8 in order to reach @xmath0  cm  s@xmath1 accuracy . hence , in addition to any fibre we will require a dedicated scrambling device to ensure that a photon s position on the ccd only depends on its wavelength but not on its position on the entrance aperture .",
    "current wavelength calibration sources such as thar lamps and i@xmath9 cells are sub - optimal in several respects , their non - uniformity and lack of long - term stability being among the concerns . however , a new concept for wavelength calibration has recently emerged . a ` laser frequency comb '",
    "system provides a series of uniformly spaced , very narrow lines whose absolute positions are known a priori with a relative precision of @xmath10@xmath11 ( see a.  manescau s contribution ; @xcite ) .",
    "neither of the two systems above currently exist , but they would be developed for espresso .",
    "being able to test and validate them ` on the sky ' would provide valuable experience and input for further improvements .",
    "the scientific goals of codex are sufficiently removed from current observational reality to require validation and demonstration of feasibility of all aspects of data handling and analysis .",
    "this includes data acquisition strategies ( e.g.  minimum and maximum viable exposure times ) , the tracking of ccd distortions , and the accuracy of flat - fielding , sky subtraction and scattered light corrections .",
    "the extraction of the cosmological signal from the data will also require testing .",
    "issues include how to deal with qso variability and the accuracy of the conversion to the cosmological reference frame .",
    "in addition espresso will allow us to determine the currently unknown intrinsic widths of the narrowest metal absorption lines in order to reassess their usefulness for the drift experiment , and to look for any sources of astrophysical noise so far overlooked .",
    "data on qsos collected with espresso for other scientific purposes would allow us to address all of the above issues .",
    "we estimate that @xmath12 hours of observations of the brightest known qsos would provide an end - to - end system verification , from data acquisition to signal extraction , at the level of @xmath13@xmath14  cm  s@xmath1 .",
    "since espresso will have characteristics similar to those of codex the question arises whether espresso can be used to make a start on the redshift drift experiment .",
    "the idea is that since espresso would be available several years before codex data appropriately collected with espresso could serve as a ` zeroth ' epoch measurement , effectively extending the time baseline of the experiment for a few years , thereby improving the final result without delaying it .",
    "[ ol_om ] shows the comparison of the cosmological constraints in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane expected from a drift experiment using codex only ( coloured ellipses ) and codex + espresso ( solid contour ) , where we have assumed that espresso would take up operation @xmath18 years before codex .",
    "evidently the extension of the time baseline by @xmath18 years is not enough to offset the lack of the vlt s photon collecting power compared to the e - elt : the improvement of the constraints is only quite modest , with the lower limit on @xmath16 increasing by @xmath2 per cent ."
