    "we have focused on the regime immediately below the critical temperature .",
    "we compared our results with those of old experiments in this regime , and the agreement is poor .",
    "the lack of agreement was expected and does not arise from the way we have treated fluctuations , but rather from tdgl itself ; no available theory reproduces the experimental data in this regime ( although the hartree approximation has been successful in situations in which fluctuations may be regarded as effectively one - dimensional @xcite ) .",
    "our method enables us to deal with wires with nonuniform cross section .",
    "in particular , we studied the influence of fluctuations and constrictions on the presence and behavior of phase slips .",
    "when a constriction is present , phase slips appear at lower currents .",
    "our formalism can be easily generalized to more complex situations , such as multiply connected topologies where non - integer fluxes are enclosed , time - dependent applied voltages or currents , moderate variations in temperature , or different evolution equations that can be cast in the form of dissipative equations .",
    "generalization to models that are not purely dissipative ( e.g. @xcite ) is not immediate .",

    "i am grateful to jens - peer kuska and aaron suggs for teaching me how to include fonts in the figures and to alexey nikulov , jacob rubinstein and boris shapiro for useful comments .",
    "a well - known difficulty in the solution of partial differential equations by means of euler iterations is that convergence requires quadratically small time steps as the computational grid becomes dense .",
    "the standard way for overcoming this difficulty is the crank - nicolson implicit scheme .",
    "however , we did not find that this scheme is useful when stochastic noise is present .",
    "our general strategy was to perform analytically the most important parts of the iteration and then add a simple euler iteration for the remaining part .",
    "our final algorithm was remarkably stable and enabled us to vary practically all the parameters in our model over several orders of magnitude .      for a dense computational grid @xmath153 and",
    "the inter - cell interaction becomes the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ ggltil ] ) .",
    "we treat this term separately . regarding @xmath154 as a vector",
    ", we have to leading term = * m * , [ veceq ] where the matrix @xmath155 has the elements @xmath156 along the diagonal , @xmath157 when the column and the row number differ by 1 , and zeros everywhere else .",
    "the first and the last rows of @xmath155 depend on the boundary conditions ; for instance , for periodic boundary conditions @xmath158 , whereas for neumann conditions @xmath159 and @xmath160 . ignoring the other contributions , eq .",
    "( [ veceq ] ) can be integrated to give ( t+)=(*m*)(t ) .",
    "[ matrixev ] @xmath155 has eigenvalues that are either negative or zero , so that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath161 is 1 .",
    "we can therefore follow the evolution of @xmath83 by means of steps that consist of three stages .",
    "the first stage is described by eq .",
    "( [ matrixev ] ) and the other two are as described at the end of sec .",
    "[ gi ] . when considering the contribution of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) , the leading term is dropped , since it has already been taken into account .",
    "the matrix @xmath161 is the same for every step , so that it has to be calculated just once .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ dpsibeta ] ) contains two contributions to @xmath162 : an  internal \" contribution @xmath163 , that will be considered here , and an  external \" contribution due to the interaction with the neighboring elements @xmath164 , that was considered above .",
    "if only the internal contribution is considered , the evolution equation can be integrated and gives @xmath165 ) ^{1/2}\\ps_{\\beta k}(t)$ ] . substituting this expression by a computationally less expensive pad approximant",
    "we obtain the algorithm ps .",
    "k [ algointern ] that takes into account the internal contribution .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath106 .",
    "for the validity of the algorithm ( [ algo ] ) we require @xmath166 .",
    "we make the estimates @xmath167 and @xmath168 . on the other hand , the fluctuations of @xmath169 , that were estimated in sec .",
    "[ vol - cur1 ] , have to be small compared to @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 has to be in the range 400/n_avl^-4 .",
    "[ rangepsi ] similarly , we require @xmath171 and @xmath172 has to be large compared to the johnson noise . from here we obtain 800/n_avn/^4 .",
    "[ rangea ] in addition , we require @xmath173 .",
    "our analysis for @xmath174 is similar to that leading to eqs .",
    "( [ rangepsi])-([rangea ] ) , but now we use the estimate @xmath175 .",
    "( [ 44 ] ) is still qualitatively true , as shown in fig .",
    "[ psisq ] . with these estimates",
    "we obtain @xmath176",
    "in this appendix we estimate the characteristic size of supercurrents in the absence of voltage .",
    "let us consider a wire with uniform cross section with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the average of the supercurrent along the wire is i_sc=_j=1^n i m , [ sc1 ] which can also be written as i_sc=-_n=0^n-1 |_n|^2 .",
    "[ sc2 ]    the ensemble average of @xmath169 is zero .",
    "its variance is obtained from the square of eq .",
    "( [ sc2 ] ) , i_sc^2=_n , n|_n|^2|_n|^2 .",
    "[ scsq ] the expression for the variance is simplified by substraction of the null quantity @xmath177 and noting that for @xmath178 @xmath179 , whereas @xmath180 .",
