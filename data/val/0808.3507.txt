    "one restricts the many - body wave - functions to a subset of the hilbert space on the one hand and guess a nuclear edf on the other hand .",
    "a commonly used technique is to break symmetries to enrich the variational sub - space and improve the description of nuclear structure . as an example",
    ", breaking gauge invariance associated to particle number conservation yields the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "this technique allows for the description of superfluidity in ground states of open - shell nuclei .",
    "extensions to treat collective excitations in the presence of pairing correlations are possible in the framework of the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) which has been widely used in nuclear structure studies  @xcite .",
    "this approach and its zero pairing counterpart ( rpa ) give reasonable estimates of giant resonances though improvements are necessary to reproduce fine structures  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the qrpa can be obtained from the linearization of the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) equation which provides a self - consistent evolution of an independent quasiparticles state .",
    "there is a consistency requirement that qrpa and the static limit of tdhfb should use the same effective interaction .",
    "this is a natural feature of tdhfb that the same edf can be easily used in the static and dynamical calculations thanks to the structure of the tdhfb equation .",
    "this is not always the case in ( q)rpa calculations where spin - orbit and coulomb parts of the residual interaction are often omitted ( see discussion in  @xcite and references therein ) , which may affect collective modes  @xcite .    unlike in condensed matter",
    "where , for instance , tdhfb has been applied to study dynamics of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , explicit time evolutions of nuclei including pairing are sparse and usually limited to the bcs ansatz of superfluidity with simple functionals  @xcite or to simple systems  @xcite . only recently , a numerical method of solving tdhfb with the gogny interaction  @xcite has been proposed to study quadrupole oscillations using a harmonic oscillator basis  @xcite . at the limit where pairing is neglected ,",

    "for instance , tdhf has been used to study anharmonicities in collective motion which are beyond the rpa range of applications  @xcite .",
    "it is then an appealing challenge to repeat these works using tdhfb to investigate the role of pairing correlations in nuclear dynamics .",
    "in particular ,  how do they affect low - energy reaction mechanisms  ?  is still an open question .",

    "these modes can be viewed as coherent sums of two - quasiparticle excitations across a major shell .",

    "for the normal part of the energy density functional , we used the sly4 skyrme functional . for its pairing part",
    ", we chose a local density dependent functional .",
    "special care has been taken regarding the convergence of the static hfb solutions and the energy and particle number conservations in the tdhfb calculations .    as a first application",
    ", we studied @xmath110 pairing modes excited by a two - neutron pair transfer type operator .",
    "the linear response theory has been used to compute the strength distributions of this operator in @xmath0o and @xmath1ca nuclei . both transitions to bound states and to the continuum are observed in all nuclei . in particular , the gpv is observed in all oxygen isotopes whereas no significant enhancement of the strength due to dynamical pairing correlations appears in the continuum of the studied calcium isotopes . in the latter , the @xmath160 quasiparticle excitations are not collective enough to generate a gpv .",
    "a detailed comparison with previous qrpa calculations have been performed in the oxygen isotopes .",
    "though there is a good agreement for the most stable isotope , we find slightly higher energies for the pairing vibrations when going to more neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "different pairing schemes and implementations of the residual interaction in both calculations are invoked to explain these differences .",
    "in addition , there is room for a better treatment of the continuum , for instance in the spirit of continuum - qrpa calculations , but such an improvement is not straightforward .",
    "indeed , one can not extrapolate the absorbing boundary conditions used in tdhf calculations to the tdhfb case because of the delocalized upper components of the bogoliubov spinors .",
    "finally , tdhfb calculations are much more demanding in terms of computational time than standard tdhf calculations , by about two orders of magnitude in the one dimensional case .",
    "however , thanks to recent increase of computational power , some of the standard tdhf applications to nuclear structure and reactions should be repeated with the inclusion of dynamical pairing correlations in the framework of tdhfb .",
