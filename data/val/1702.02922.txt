    "owing to interferometric imaging with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) and european vlbi network ( evn ) observations , frb 121102 was recently localized to @xmath9 mas and @xmath10 mas precisions @xcite .",

    "different from thermal phenomena , non - thermal emission from pulsars should have both on- and off - pulse phases in a rotation period .",
    "the non - thermal emissions are produced during particle acceleration and creation in some limited regions in the magnetosphere such as polar cap ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "hence , in grp - like emission model , the pulse width of frbs gives the lower limit on the rotation period .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the grp - like pulsed emission model for the repeating frb 121102 . in section 2 , we give the constraints on the spin - down luminosity and the rotation period from the observed luminosity and the pulse width , respectively .",
    "we also discuss prediction for the flux evolution , the constraints from the propagation effects , and possible ns formation scenarios for the source of frb 121102 in section 3 .",

    "we use fiducial radius and moment of inertia of a ns at @xmath17 km , and @xmath18 g @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "since we focus on a very young ns whose age ( @xmath20 yr ) is much shorter than the decay timescales of dipole magnetic field in interior of a ns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we neglect the temporal evolution of the dipole field .",
    "the propagation effects on the radio emission and the possible association of persistent radio source could give significant constraints on the model for frb 121102 @xcite .",
    "for example , if the injected energy from a ns changes the dynamics of surrounded materials , the observed dm could give constraints on the ns parameters .",
    "however , the dm is highly sensitive to the unknown ejecta properties such as non - uniformity , composition , and ionization state of circumburst materials .",
    "the detected persistent radio source could be interpreted by a low - luminosity agn @xcite , so that the persistent source may not be directly related to the frb source .",

    "we consider two conditions to produce the repeating frbs 121102 via grp - like emission model .",

    "we use the burst with an isotropic luminosity of @xmath38 erg s@xmath15 @xcite detected at @xmath394 yr after the first burst detection .",
    "second , the pulse width @xmath40 has to be shorter than the rotational period @xmath41 for grp - like emission . if the emission pattern is beamed , the pulse width relative to the rotation period should be short compared with the isotropic emission case . using the beaming fraction @xmath42 ,",
    "the condition on the rotation period is @xmath43 unless all three axes , magnetic axis , rotation axis , and line - of - sight are nearly aligned .",
    "the temporal evolution of the rotation period is described by @xmath44 the observed gaussian fwhm is @xmath8 ms for 17 bursts @xcite .",
    "although the widest observed pulse width was @xmath45 ms for burst number 5 in @xcite , this pulse seems to be split into two components .",
    "here , we adopt the second widest width @xmath46 ms for burst number 10 in @xcite , though the following results would be almost comparable . note that the width in the source rest frame is @xmath47 times shorter than the observed one .",

    "each panel shows the case with different parameter sets ( @xmath42 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 ) . since first burst of frb 121102 were detected in 2012 @xcite , the ns age at which the strongest burst were detected @xcite is @xmath48 yr in the source rest frame .",

    "allowed ranges of parameters are very limited , @xmath52 g and @xmath53 ms .",
    "such a ns with short @xmath34 is very rare from the initial period distribution obtained by pulsar population studies @xcite , the associated supernova remnants @xcite , and the total injected energy of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the observed frb luminosity is almost comparable to the spin - down luminosity in the allowed parameter region , the conversion efficiency from spin - down flux to the frb flux should be an order of unity at @xmath51 yr .",
    "then , the observed frb flux density at 1.4ghz will rapidly decay toward @xmath54 jy because the ns age in the allowed region is already @xmath55 .",
    "figure [ limit ] ( b ) shows the allowed parameter region in the anisotropic emission case , @xmath56 . since the intrinsic frb luminosity is lower than the isotropic case , the allowed parameter region from the luminosity condition ( [ luminosity_condition ] ) becomes larger than the fiducial case ( figure [ limit ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the upper limit on the magnetic field is @xmath57 g. the fraction @xmath58 should also reduce in the anisotropic emission case , so that the lower limit on the magnetic field becomes high at @xmath59 compared with the fiducial case . as a result",

    "the allowed range of the initial period becomes large , @xmath60 ms .",

    "derived from condition ( [ period_condition ] ) is @xmath67 .",
    "from the two constraints on the dipole magnetic field , we obtain the constraints on the age of the ns @xmath26 in the source rest frame , described by @xmath68 note that there is no allowed parameter region at @xmath62 if condition ( [ age_constraint ] ) are not satisfied . at @xmath69",

    "the upper limit on the age ( inequality [ age_constraint ] ) does not depend on the beaming fraction @xmath42 and the braking index @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , if the origin of frb 121102 is the grp - like emission from a very young ns , the ns was born in a short time before the first detection at 2012 and frb signal with flux density @xmath70 jy will not be able to be detected after 2017 .",
    "we investigate the grp - like emission model for an origin of repeating frb 121102 to give constraints on the ns parameters from the observations .",
    "in addition to the luminosity condition that ( a ) the intrinsic luminosity of frbs is lower than the spin - down luminosity , we consider that ( b ) intrinsic pulse width of frb is shorter than the rotational period .",
    "two conditions do not depend on the environment of the source . in order to explain the observed highest luminosity and the widest pulse width from frb 121102 simultaneously ,",
    "the dipole magnetic field is @xmath52 g and the initial period @xmath53 ms in the grp - like model if the emission is isotropically emitted @xmath71 and temporal evolution follows the dipole radiation formula @xmath72 . since @xmath73 for the ns in the allowed region , the conversion efficiency from the spin - down luminosity to the frb luminosity",
    "should be an order of unity .",
    "the allowed dipole magnetic field becomes high for the anisotropic emission case ( @xmath74 ) , and low for small braking index @xmath75 , although the allowed range @xmath76 does not depend on @xmath42 and @xmath27 .",
    "the maximum initial period becomes long for the anisotropic emission case , @xmath77 .",
    "the observed flux of repulsive bursts from frb 121102 have not shown apparent temporal evolution since the first detection @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - down luminosity is expected to already decay as @xmath78 at @xmath79 yr ( i.e. , the allowed region in figure [ limit ] satisfies at @xmath80 ) .",
    "if the radio efficiency , @xmath81 , is constant , such behaviors are inconsistent .",
    "note that the radiation efficiency of grp has been poorly understood @xcite .",
    "the radio efficiency of normal pulse increases as the spin - down luminosity decreases in galactic pulsars whose ages are older than the spin - down timescale @xcite .",
    "if the radio efficiency of grp ( and frb ) has the similar to that of normal pulse , the flux may show no apparent temporal evolution until @xmath79 yr .",
    "however , once the radiation efficiency reaches to the maximum value @xmath82 at the age @xmath79 yr which does not depend on @xmath42 and @xmath27 ( inequality [ age_constraint ] ) , the observed radio flux density will rapidly decay ( @xmath3 jy ) as the evolution of the spin - down luminosity even if the radiation efficiency keeps to be an order of unity at @xmath83 yr .",
    "if frbs with flux @xmath84 jy will be detected from repeating frb 121102 after 2017 ( i.e. , @xmath83 yr ) , we need to consider an alternative model , such as the magnetically powered flare from a magnetar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that condition ( [ period_condition ] ) is also working if the frb emission occurs in the magnetar magnetosphere for the magnetically powered flare model .    observed dm and its time - derivative could give significant constraints on the origin of the frb @xcite .",
    "since a ns is formed as a result of core - collapse supernova , a young ns is generally surrounded by the dense ejecta . for simplicity , a dm through the ejecta may be described by dm@xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the mass and velocity of the ejecta which mainly consist of @xmath88-elements , @xmath89 is the ionization fraction , and @xmath90 is a proton mass .",
    "we assume singly ionization state for elements with the mean atomic mass number @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 . a ns which resides the allowed range in figure [ limit ] has huge initial rotation energy @xmath93 erg compared with conventional supernova explosion energy ( @xmath94 erg ) .",
    "since the age is @xmath55 , the significant fraction of the rotation energy would be converted to the ejecta kinetic energy , @xmath95 . using the constraints",
    "@xmath96 @xmath6 pc yr@xmath15 for frb 121102 estimated by @xcite , the maximum ejecta mass is estimated as @xmath97 , much lower than the conventional core - collapse supernova case ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the ns would be formed with low mass ejecta , compared with the conventional core - collapse supernovae , such as accretion - induced collapse ( @xmath99 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "then , the dm and its derivative through the propagation of such low - mass ejecta may be consistent with the observed values .",

    "if a frb emitting ns is born after the binary ns merger with low - mass ejecta case ( @xmath101 ) , it is important to detect the electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational wave sources because the macronovae are too dim to detect by current observations for such low - mass ejecta case ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a possible solution to resolve the discrepancy between the constraints from dm and",
