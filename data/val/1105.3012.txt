    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts )  @xcite is one of the most intriguing research subjects in condensed matter physics .",
    "a qpt occurs at absolute zero due to quantum fluctuations in a variety of quantum many - body systems . in the conventional landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm ,",
    "a phase transition accompanies spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )  @xcite that is characterized by a local order parameter .",
    "however , it now becomes clear that not all qpts fall into this category  @xcite .",
    "in fact , topological phase transitions do not involve any ssb .",
    "this even dates back to the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition  @xcite , first discovered for two - dimensional classical @xmath1 model . actually , the kt transion is ubiquitous in one - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "it describes the instability of the luttinger liquid under a marginal perturbation . normally , it is not an easy task to determine whether or not the kt transition occurs in a specific system , because there are pathological problems to analyze the kt transition numerically .",
    "one of these problems is that the finite size scaling technique  @xcite , which is successful for second order qpts  @xcite , can not be applied to the kt transition  @xcite , since there are logarithmic corrections from the marginal perturbation .",
    "recently , a novel approach to qpts in quantum many - body lattice systems has been put forward  @xcite , which is based on fidelity , a measure of quantum state distinguishability , in quantum information science . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ground - state fidelity per lattice site is able to capture quantum criticality underlying many - body physics in condensed matter .",
    "this fact , combining with a practical means to compute the ground - state fidelity per lattice site for infinite - size quantum lattice systems , make it practical to investigate critical phenomena in quantum many - body systems .",
    "coincidentally , recent developments in the context of the tensor network ( tn ) algorithms for translation - invariant quantum lattice systems offer such a practical means . here , we mention the infinite matrix product state ( imps ) algorithm  @xcite in one spatial dimension and the infinite projected entangled - pair states ( ipeps )  @xcite in two or higher spatial dimensions .",
    "these algorithms exploit the translation invariance of the system and parallelizability of a tn representation of quantum many - body wave functions , which provides an efficient way to classically simulate quantum many - body lattice systems .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite , we have succeeded in applying the fidelity per site approach to study the kt transition in both the one - dimensional spin @xmath0 xxz model and the spin 1 xxz model with uniaxial single - ion anisotropy .",
    "this results in the introduction of a novel concept-_pseudo _ ssb , offering a novel perspective to understand the kt transition , in the conventional landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm , from the imps representation . as such",
    ", it resolved the controversy regarding whether or not the ground - state fidelity is able to detect the kt qpts  @xcite .",
    "however , more work is needed to clarify if such an approach is applicable to the kt transition in other quantum many - body lattice systems .    .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 represents the ratio between the nnn coupling and the nn coupling .",
    "the dash - line box indicates the unit cell.,width=268 ]    in this paper , we propose an imps algorithm , a generalization of the infinite time - evolving block decimation algorithm  @xcite , which allows us to accommodate both the next - to - the - nearest - neighbor interaction and spontaneous dimerization .",
    "it is found that , in the critical regime , the algorithm automatically leads to infinite degenerate ground - state wave functions , due to the finiteness of the truncation dimension .",
    "this results in _ pseudo _ symmetry spontaneous breakdown , as reflected in a bifurcation in the ground - state fidelity per lattice site .",
    "in addition , this allows to introduce a pseudo - order parameter to characterize the kt transition , which must be scaled down to zero in order to be consistent with the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite .",
    "suppose the model hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath3}$ ] , with @xmath4}$ ] being the sum of the nearest - neighbor and the next - to - the - nearest - neighbor three - body hamiltonian density .",
    "a realization of such a model hamiltonian in the zigzag chain is shown in fig .",
    "[ zigzag ] . to take account of a possible dimerization arising from the competition between quantum fluctuations and geometric frustration , we choose four sequential sites @xmath5 as a unit cell .",
    "starting with a randomly chosen initial state @xmath6 , which is not orthogonal to the genuine ground state , a ground - state wave function can be computed by the imaginary time evolution @xmath7 .",
    "to realize the imaginary time evolution operation , the imaginary time @xmath8 is divided into many small slices @xmath9 to approximate the continuous time evolution by a sequence of small gates .",
    "meanwhile , the time evolution operator is expanded to a product of evolution operators acting on three sites : @xmath10 } \\delta \\tau ) $ ] with @xmath11 , as follows from the suzuki - trotter decomposition  @xcite .",
