    "in the standard picture of low mass star formation ( e.g. , shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) , class  i protostars are young sources ( age @xmath0 years ) that are still surrounded by massive ( @xmath1 ) circumstellar disks and partially obscured by their natal envelopes .",

    "the basic model consists of a dusty infalling envelope with cavities carved by the energetic outflows associated with this phase of star formation .",

    "we demonstrate that including the effects of multiple illumination sources , multiple outflow cavities , and mis - aligned circumstellar disks can explain the observed scattered light patterns much more fully than has been possible with 2-d modeling efforts hitherto . we have not undertaken an exhaustive search of parameter space when modeling the two objects as such investigations",

    "the effects of changing the evnelope parameters ( e.g. , accretion rate , centrifugal radius , inclination ) have been described in the aforementioned papers and our focus is on the departures from axisymmetry required to obtain a better match between the scattered light models and data .",
    "furthermore , since we view our models as a first step towards unravelling the complexities of the scattered light patterns , we have not attempted to quantify any figure of merit for model fits to the data .",

    "the reduced and psf - subtracted f555w image of t  tau was provided to us by karl stapelfeldt . for iras  04016 + 2610",
    "the nicmos data were obtained from the hst archive and were re - reduced using the iraf stsdas package with the most recent set of reference files available .",
    "we created bad pixel masks using the data - quality frames associated with each image , manually masking transient bad pixels , and we also manually masked the bad column 128 ( bergeron & skinner 1997 ) .",

    "the deconvolution was performed within iraf using the stsdas lucy task , which uses a richardson - lucy based algorithm .",

    "for iras  04016 + 2610 we also obtained an @xmath5 band image using the wiyn telescope s ccd imager .",
    "the wiyn observations were obtained on 13/14 december 1995 using the wiyn imager camera , as part of a feasibility study conducted under the wiyn queue observing program .",

    "in this section we present the basic ingredients of the 3-d radiation transfer code used to model t  tau and iras  04016 + 2610 .",
    "the code is comprehensive , and necessarily involves a large number of parameters that in principle can be tuned to match observations . wherever possible , we constrain our model parameters based on known properties of the sources .    the basic geometry we consider consists of an infalling envelope with bipolar cavities , illuminated from within by a single source or a binary system . for binary illumination ,",
    "the two components possess circumstellar disks that are not necessarily aligned with one another or with the envelope s rotation axis .",
    "of the two sources we model in this paper , t  tau is a known binary ( dyck , simon , & zuckerman 1982 ) and iras  04016 + 2610 shows evidence for binarity with possibly two bipolar outflow cavities ( lucas & roche 1997 ) . despite the binary nature of the sources , we adopt the rotational collapse geometry of terebey , shu , & cassen ( 1984 , hereafter tsc ) developed for single star systems .",
    "we thus in effect assume that the circumbinary density is given by the tsc solution and neglect the effects of binary motion on the envelope structure .",
    "the focus of our present study is the 3-d nature of the cavities and envelope illumination ; future studies may include circumbinary density distributions predicted from binary star formation models .",
    "the tsc envelope density used in our simulations is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass infall rate , @xmath8 is the centrifugal radius , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is determined by @xmath11 for our models , we vary @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in the range @xmath12yr@xmath13 and @xmath14au ( strom 1994 ; kenyon et al . 1993b ; whitney , et al .",
    "our radiation transfer code uses a linear cartesian grid (   3.5 ) and in order to resolve the tsc density structure we adopt an outer radius for the envelope of 1500au .",
    "we note that in the models of whitney & hartmann ( 1993 ) and whitney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , outer radii of around 10000au were adopted .",
    "we have found that while our smaller envelopes can reproduce the overall morphology of the scattered light images , larger envelopes produce redder colors ( see the iras  04016 + 2610 models in  4.2 ) .",
    "we explore three dimensional geometries by carving cavities in the axisymmetric tsc envelope . by virtue of being 2-d , previous modeling ( e.g. , whitney & hartmann 1993 ;",
    "whitney et al . 1997 ; lucas & roche 1997 ; stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) used bipolar cavities that were aligned with the envelope s rotational axis . in our models",
    "we adopt the same cavity shapes as used previously , but now allow the cavities to be offset from the envelope s symmetry axis and also allow for the existence of multiple sets of cavities , as might result in a binary system .",
    "we consider three cavity shapes in our modeling : streamline , cylindrical , and curved . in the streamline cavity shape , the cavity walls trace out the trajectory of an infalling particle as given in the tsc envelope solution .",
    "this cavity shape is approximately conical at large radii , but at small radii becomes more curved .",
    "the curvature increases the cross - section of the cavity walls exposed to direct starlight and results in more scattering than a purely conical shape and consequently a brighter cavity ( see whitney & hartmann 1993 ) .",
    "cylindrical cavities have straight walls parallel to the outflow axis .",
    "curved cavities take the form @xmath15 ( e.g. , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998b ) , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are parameters that can be adjusted to provide a good match to the data or to approximate an opening angle of a molecular outflow .",
    "we also allow for the presence of dust within the cavities .      as stated earlier , t  tau is a binary and there are indications that iras  04016 + 2610 may also be a binary",
    ". therefore we assume the illumination is by binary star  +  disk systems as used by wood , crosas , & ghez ( 1999 ) in their scattered light model of gg  tau s circumbinary disk . in this model",
    "we assumed two point sources of illumination , but with the radiation angular distribution of a star  +  disk system . in this approximation",
    "we do not explicitly treat the radiation transfer through the circumstellar disks , but assign an angular distribution for the flux emerging from the star+disk systems .",
    "the angular dependence of the illumination of these `` star  +  disk '' systems is displayed in figure  1 , showing the small emergent flux level at high inclinations due to the dense equatorial disk ( whitney & hartmann 1992 ) .",
    "the angular distribution of the illuminating sources was set up so that the sources would be at the center of the cavities , with the polar direction of the illumination pattern aligned with the cavity axis .      as with previous modeling of taurus protostars ( kenyon et al .",
    "1993b ; whitney et al .",
    "1997 ; wood et al .",
    "1998 ) we adopt the albedo , opacity , and scattering parameters for a kim , martin , & hendry ( 1994 , hereafter kmh ) grain mixture , typical of grains in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the scattering phase function is assumed to be a henyey - greenstein phase function ( henyey & greenstein 1941 ) with asymmetry parameter @xmath19 . in more evolved disk systems",
    "the spectral index and level of the long wavelength continuum emission provides strong evidence for dust grains that are larger than ism grains ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . however , whitney et al . ( 1997 ) found that the kmh parameters gave a good match to the colors and sizes of images class  i sources , but that they underestimated the polarization level .",
    "the kmh wavelength dependent opacity and scattering parameters we adopt in this paper are presented in table  1 .",
    "we perform the radiation transfer with a monte carlo code that allows for arbitrary sources of emission and multiple scattering within an arbitrary geometry .",
    "the scattering code is based on that described by code & whitney ( 1995 ) , but has now been modified to run on a three dimensional linear cartesian grid ( wood & reynolds 1999 ) and includes forced first scattering ( witt 1977 ) and a `` peeling off '' procedure ( yusef - zadeh , morris , & white 1984 ) .",
    "these modifications enable us to construct model images of three dimensional systems from specified viewing angles very efficiently .",
    "we have tested our 3d code against results from the axisymmetric code of whitney & hartmann ( 1993 ) , finding excellent agreement between the two codes .",
    "the output of each monte carlo simulation is a two dimensional image including the spatially resolved polarization ( stokes @xmath5 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 images ) . in order to compare our models with the observations we convolve our high resolution models with appropriate psfs using the tinytim software ( krist 1995 ) . from these images",
    "we calculate the integrated polarization and by combining simulations at different wavelengths we calculate colors for comparison with observations .",
    "the colors we compute are subject to a normalization set by the intrinsic color of the illuminating source(s ) . the observed color is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the source color and @xmath24 is the color of the monte carlo simulation . in their simulations ,",

    "( 1994 ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in our models of iras  04016 + 2610",
    "we adopt the same source colors .",
    "however , for t  tau the spectral type is k0 or earlier and since we are modeling only the wfpc2 f555w image the intrinsic source colors are not required .",
    "in this section we present our models for t  tau and iras  04016 + 2610 . as our aim in this paper",
    "is to demonstrate the usefulness of our 3-d modeling method , we report here on those models that best reproduce the observed scattered light images , and discuss the salient properties of those models .",
    "as we discuss in detail for each source , we constrain the parameters of our models based on the available data from the literature . nonetheless , the uniqueness of the models presented is not demonstrated .",
    "these models should be regarded as existence proofs and as suggestions for more detailed 3-d investigations of these and other class  i sources in the future .",
    "t tau is a binary star with one component seen directly and the secondary ( @xmath27 arcsec distant ) only detected at ir and longer wavelengths ( dyck , simon , & zuckerman 1982 ; ghez et al .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of the sources are estimated to be @xmath28 for the primary ( ghez et al .",
    "1991 ) and up to @xmath29 for the secondary ( cohen , emerson , & beichman 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , although undetected at optical wavelengths , the secondary may be emitting a lot of radiation which we only observe when it is scattered into our sightline .",
    "the optical light of the secondary may be obscured by either its location within a dense circumbinary envelope , or occulted by its own circumstellar disk edge - on to our line of sight .",
    "the wfpc2 scattered light pattern shows departures from axisymmetry with one side of the cavity appearing brighter than the other ( figure 2a ; stapelfeldt et al .",
    "a similar asymmetric scattered light pattern is seen in the near - ir adaptive optics images of roddier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    the radial distribution of the near - ir scattered light surrounding t  tau ( weintraub et al .",
    "1992 ) was modeled by whitney & hartmann ( 1993 ) adopting a near pole - on orientation of a tsc envelope ( @xmath30yr@xmath13 , @xmath31au ) and evacuated bipolar cavities .",
    "they found that cavities with streamline shapes give too steep a gradient in the radial distribution of the scattered light and suggested that curved cavities could provide a better fit to the data .",
    "stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1998b ) modeled t  tau s scattered light pattern assuming single scattering in a tsc envelope and investigated what viewing angle and cavity curvature is required to match their hst images .",
    "they estimated the inclination of the system to be in the range @xmath32 to @xmath33 with curved cavities ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "figure 2b shows the axisymmetric single source model of stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "the scattered light distribution in the model is necessarily symmetric , and does not reproduce the strong asymmetry observed in the wfpc2 image .      a binary system with shadowing caused by misaligned circumstellar disks may yield a scattered light pattern such as that observed in t  tau",
    ". indeed , stapelfeldt et al . ( 1998b ) suggested that the unseen secondary may play an important role in forming the scattered light pattern .",
    "we have therefore constructed a scattered light model for t  tau incorporating illumination from a binary star system and allowed the alignment of the circumstellar disks to depart from coplanarity .",
    "our modeling of t  tau begins with the axisymmetric tsc envelope model of whitney & hartmann ( 1993 ) with the curved cavities derived by stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , and we adopt @xmath37 which results in a visual extinction through the envelope to the primary of @xmath38 , close to the observed value .",
    "however , in our model the axisymmetry is broken by the illuminating sources .",
    "the illumination is by a binary star  +  disk system where the primary source is aligned with the rotational axis of the envelope and the secondary ( larger bolometric luminosity ) has its disk aligned so that its polar axis points towards one side of the cavity wall .",
    "the direction of the secondary s axis is chosen to agree with the large outflow discovered by reipurth , bally , & devine ( 1997 ) , which is believed to originate from the secondary .",
    "we assume the secondary emits 1.5 times more photons than the primary , based on their estimated bolometric luminosity ratio .",
    "the secondary is located 90au from the primary in the envelope s equatorial plane with its disk rotational axis at @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the usual polar coordinates ) . for our adopted viewing angle",
    "the secondary disk is edge - on to our line of sight and consequently its direct light is highly extincted at optical wavelengths , consistent with its very red spectral energy diistribution .",
    "furthermore the disk orientation blocks the light from the secondary from reaching one side of the cavity . in this model",
    "we assume the primary and secondary are within the same cavity , created by a combination of outflows from both sources .    in figures 2c and 2d we show new 3-d scattered light models that better reproduce the observed scattered light image of t  tau .",
    "we rotated these model images by @xmath43 to allow for comparison with the wfpc2 data .",
    "the model in fig .",
    "2c shows the scattered light pattern when the illumination is by misaligned circumstellar disks where the angular dependence of the illumination for each star  +  disk system is that of the wh92 model in fig .  1 .",
    "the non - axisymmetric illumination yields an asymmetric nebula with one side brighter than the other , similar to what is observed .",
    "direct light from the secondary is blocked due to our adopted edge - on orientation of its circumstellar disk , consistent with the lack of observed optical light from the secondary .    in fig .",
    "2d we allowed the secondary s illumination pattern to depart from that of the wh92 star  +  disk of fig .  1 in order to investigate whether we could increase the asymmetry in our scattered light models .",
    "in this model , the illumination pattern from the secondary is more concentrated towards the polar regions ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "such an illumination may arise if the secondary s circumstellar material is arranged in a highly flared disk ( e.g. , chiang & goldreich 1999 ) or a small envelope ( roddier et al . 2000 ) . with the more extreme illumination pattern ,",
    "the asymmetry of the model scattered light nebula is enhanced .      our model for t",
    "tau resembles the wfpc2 image in that it reproduces the asymmetry in the scattered light nebula .",
    "support for our model may be found in observations which show a very complex pattern of outflows in co ( schuster , harris , & russell 1997 ; leverault 1998 ) and molecular hydrogen ( herbst , et al .",
    "1996 ; van langevelde et al . 1994 ) . as with iras  04016 + 2610 ( see below ) , the plethora of emission knots and filaments is suggestive of a precessing jet and/or multiple outflow sources .",
    "the most compelling support for the orientation of the secondary in our models is that its disk axis is aligned with the direction of the outflow discovered by reipurth et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and attributed to the secondary .    in our model the circumstellar disk axes are offset from one another , the primary viewed at a low inclination and the secondary oriented close to edge - on to our line of sight .",
    "this is not an unreasonable assumption , given the fact that the secondary in the t  tau system is undetected at optical wavelengths .",
    "also , a system with such a geometry has been observed in the binary hk  tau where the primary is seen directly and the secondary s scattered light nebula indicates a highly inclined circumstellar disk ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998a ; koresko 1998 ) .",
    "the inclusion of a secondary source not only breaks the asymmetry in the scattered light image , but also increases the contrast between the bright cavity walls and the region interior to this . in their axisymmetric modeling , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1998b ) produced a contrast no greater than about two between the nebular arc and the inner region , whereas the wfpc2 image shows a contrast in excess of four .",

    "the nicmos images of padgett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and centimeter observations of lucas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did not resolve a binary companion .",
    "we also constucted a model with the two outflow cavities described above , but illumination from a single source . because the disk sources depart from isotropy only along equatorial directions ( fig .  1 )",
    ", we found that the scattered light pattern from a single source is not distinguished from that of the unresolved binary model of fig .",
    "4 . therefore ,",
    "unlike our t tau model , we infer that for iras  04016 + 2610 it is the envelope structure that is most important in producing the image morphology and not asymmetric illumination .",
    "our model reproduces the overall size and morphology of the wiyn and nicmos images very well . in the @xmath5 band model ,",
    "the envelope is optically thick and it is the cavities that dominate the image morphology .",
    "however , at optically thinner longer wavelengths the envelope structure is important in shaping the resulting image .",
    "our model has a single tsc envelope with the primary cavity along the rotation axis and the second cavity almost perpendicular to this .",
    "if the source is indeed a binary then the envelope geometry is likely different from tsc .",
    "indeed , recent modeling of imaging spectroscopy by hogerheijde ( 2001 ) adopted a 2000au radius axisymmetric rotating disklike structure .",
    "such a `` disk '' should not be confused with the smaller circumstellar disks we adopt and are seen in other classical t tauri stars ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "1996 ; padgett et al .",
    "the tsc rotational collapse geometry produces a large equatorial density enhancement which may correspond to hogerheijde s parameterized equatorial structure . as such , the equatorial enhancement of tsc and hogerheijde s `` disk '' represent a different evolutionary stage from disks around classical t  tauri stars ( shu et al .",
    "a more detailed model of iras  04016 + 2610 than we have undertaken should simultaneously address the envelope geometry and velocity structure . nevertheless , our models which incorporate the tsc parameters determined by kenyon et al .",
    "( 1993b ) and whitney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provide support for lucas & roche s ( 1997 ) dual bipolar cavity interpretation of their imaging polarimetry .",
    "our model colors are @xmath54 , @xmath55 giving actual colors of @xmath56 , @xmath57 when combined with the adopted intrinsic colors (   2.5 ) .",
    "the observed colors for iras  04016 + 2610 are @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( kenyon & hartman 1995 ; whitney et al .",
    "the failure of both our models and those of whitney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to reproduce these colors ( both models predict @xmath60>[h - k]$ ] ) may indicate that the intrinsic source colors are different than those we have adopted .",
    "while we have been succesful at reproducing the image morphology , our models suffer from the same problem as those of whitney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in that they predict lower polarizations than observed .",
    "whitney et al .",
    "attribute this to the low intrinsic polarization of the kmh grains . in our case ,",
    "the resolved polarization is lower than observed due to the dust grains , but we also find much lower levels for the total unresolved polarization in our models .",
    "we typically predict an integrated polarization of around 3% in the near - ir , whereas the observed polarization ranges from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ( whitney et al .",
    "another problem is that neither our models or those of whitney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) can reproduce the observed pattern of polarization vectors close to the source(s ) .",
    "so , while the dual cavity scenario proposed by lucas & roche ( 1997 ) gives a good match to the overall image morphology , its failure to reproduce the observed polarization level and pattern in iras  04016 + 2610 indicates that the details of the model need to be refined .",
    "in particular , polarization due to scattering off aligned grains can yield larger polarization values and we are investigating grain alignment in protostars to reconcile models with the large observed polarizations ( whitney & wolff 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have constructed 3d models for the scattered light nebulae associated with iras  04016 + 2610 , and t  tau .",
    "our models assumed an axisymmetric infalling circumstellar envelope , but the axisymmetry was broken by multiple outflow cavities and non - axisymmetric illumination from binary stars .",
    "the asymmetry seen in the nebula surrounding t  tau was modeled by introducing a secondary star+disk system with its rotation axis misaligned from the axis of the tsc envelope .",
    "the orientation of the secondary was chosen so that its disk was oriented almost edge - on to our line of sight , and was selected to be perpendicular to the herbig - haro outflow attributed to the secondary ( reipurth et al .",
    "this orientation results in the secondary being undetected in our scattered light models as its disk extincts the direct optical light .",
    "we reproduced the scattered light pattern associated with iras  04016 + 2610 with a model which had two sets of bipolar outflow cavities in the tsc envelope .",
    "this model affirms the notion of lucas & roche ( 1997 ) , who interpreted their near - ir imaging polarimetry as arising from scattering in an envelope with orthogonal bipolar cavities .",
    "further evidence for multiple cavities in the envelope is found in the complex pattern of outflow emission knots surrounding this source ( gomez et al .",
    "our model fails , however , to reproduce the level and pattern of the near - ir polarization and we suspect that a more accurate treatment of polarization from scattering off aligned grains may provide a better match to the observations ( whitney & wolff 2001 , in preparation ) .    in the models presented in this paper",
    ", we adopted the axisymmetric tsc solution for the circumstellar envelopes .",
    "this may not be appropriate as t  tau is a known binary and iras  04016 + 2610 shows strong evidence for binarity .",
    "also , other studies indicate that protostellar environments have material arranged with a shallower radial gradient than tsc ( e.g. , barsony & chandler 1993 ) .",
    "the extension of our monte carlo scattering codes to three dimensions now enables us to incorporate more complex circumstellar envelope structures , such as those predicted from binary star formation models .",
    "however , this is among the first modeling investigations to explore the effects of three dimensional cavity structures and illuminations and has proved successful in reproducing the scattered light morphologies and in testing several scenarios proposed by others to explain the observations .",
    "while we have been fairly succesful in reproducing the scattered light morphologies , spectral energy distribution modeling incorporating the 3d structures will provide a crucial test of our models .",
    "this requires current axisymmetric radiation transfer radiative equilibrium codes to be extended to three dimensions and we are developing such techniques ( bjorkman & wood 2001 ) .",
