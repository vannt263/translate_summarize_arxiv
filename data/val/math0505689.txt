    "a flat of a matroid is _ cyclic _ if it is a ( possibly empty ) union of circuits .",
    "cyclic flats have played several important roles in matroid theory , starting with the theory of transversal matroids ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the cyclic flats of a matroid @xmath2 , ordered by inclusion , form a lattice , @xmath3 : the join of two cyclic flats @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath3 is @xmath6 and their meet is the union of all circuits contained in @xmath7 .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : lattice ] . )",
    "this paper studies the lattice of cyclic flats and offers insights into some topics in matroid theory from this perspective .",
    "figure  [ fig : lattice ] shows that properties of the lattice of flats , such as being graded , may fail in the lattice of cyclic flats .",
    "indeed , in  section  [ sec : basic ] we prove that every lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of cyclic flats of some matroid .",
    "figure  [ fig : lattice ] also shows that the collection of cyclic flats alone does not determine the matroid .",
    "however , the cyclic flats together with their ranks determine the matroid  ( * ? ? ? * proposition  2.1 ) .",
    "section  [ sec : axioms ] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a collection @xmath0 of sets and a function @xmath1 to be the lattice of cyclic flats of a matroid and the restriction of the corresponding rank function to @xmath0 .",
    "this axiom scheme for matroids is used in section  [ sec : free ] to give a simple , alternative perspective on the free product  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : cw ] introduces the concept of cyclic width and shows that the class of matroids of cyclic width @xmath8 or less is closed under minors and duals .",
    "we explore these classes for small values of @xmath8 .",
    "the final section contains open problems .",
    "we assume familiarity with matroid theory .",
    "we follow the notation of  @xcite .",
    "we call a matroid _ bitransversal _ if it is both transversal and cotransversal ( or a strict gammoid ) . recall that the free extension @xmath9 of @xmath2 by @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , is the matroid on @xmath12 whose circuits are the circuits of @xmath2 together with the sets @xmath13 for bases @xmath5 of @xmath2 .",
    "free coextension is the dual operation , @xmath14 .",
    "our lattice theory notation follows  @xcite except that we use @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the least and greatest elements of a lattice @xmath0 . as is true of a lattice of flats and a lattice of cyclic flats , the elements of most lattices in this paper are sets and the order relation is containment",
    "; we use the term _ lattice of sets _ for such a lattice .",
    "the meet and join operations of a lattice of sets need not be intersection and union .",
    "all lattices considered in this paper are finite .",
    "we close this introduction by recalling that cyclic flats link two notions of duality .",
    "since cyclic flats are unions of circuits as well as intersections of hyperplanes , @xmath17 is a cyclic flat of @xmath2 if and only if @xmath18 is a cyclic flat of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , as noted in  @xcite , @xmath20 is isomorphic to the dual ( as a lattice ) of @xmath3 .",
    "by considering matroids in which every element is in a nontrivial parallel class , it follows that every geometric lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of cyclic flats of some matroid .",
    "the main result of this section is that for any lattice @xmath0 , there is a matroid @xmath2 ( in fact , a bitransversal matroid ) for which the lattice @xmath3 of cyclic flats is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that the counterpart of this result does not hold for matroids that are representable over a fixed finite field .",
    "we will use fundamental transversal matroids and their simplex representation ( @xcite or  ( * ? ? ? * section  12.2 ) ) .",
    "a _ fundamental _ ( or _ principal _ ) _ transversal matroid _ is a matroid @xmath2 that has a basis @xmath5 such that each cyclic flat of @xmath2 is spanned by a subset of @xmath5 . to construct a geometric representation of @xmath2 ,",
    "let @xmath5 be @xmath21 and put @xmath22 at the @xmath23 vertices of an @xmath23-simplex in @xmath24 .",
    "for each @xmath25 in @xmath26 , place @xmath25 freely in the ( possibly empty ) face of the simplex spanned by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fundamental circuit of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath5 . note that if @xmath17 is a rank-@xmath8 cyclic flat of @xmath2 , then @xmath17 consists of the points in a @xmath29-dimensional face of the simplex .",
    "conversely , any matroid with a geometric representation on a simplex that has elements at each vertex and for which each rank-@xmath8 cyclic flat consists of the points in a @xmath29-dimensional face of the simplex is a fundamental transversal matroid .",
    "fundamental transversal matroids are indeed transversal matroids ; in fact , every transversal matroid is a deletion of a fundamental transversal matroid .",
    "it is well known that these matroids are bitransversal .",
    "we are ready to treat the main result of this section .",
    "[ thm : alllattices ] every lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of cyclic flats of a bitransversal matroid .",
    "let @xmath0 be a lattice .",
    "we construct a fundamental transversal matroid @xmath2 for which @xmath3 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "we first realize @xmath0 as a lattice of sets .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of elements in @xmath0 other than @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath30 in @xmath0 , let @xmath31 be @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 .",
    "the map @xmath34 is an isomorphism between @xmath0 and the lattice of sets @xmath35 since it is a bijection and @xmath36 in @xmath0 if and only if @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the following fundamental transversal matroid on @xmath38 .",
    "place the elements of @xmath5 at the vertices of a @xmath39-simplex in @xmath40 and , for each @xmath30 in @xmath0 , put @xmath41 freely in the face spanned by @xmath42 . by construction , @xmath42 spans a cyclic flat of @xmath2 , namely , @xmath43 . with the isomorphism above , the theorem follows upon showing that these are the only cyclic flats of @xmath2 .",
    "assume the subset @xmath44 of @xmath5 spans a cyclic flat @xmath45 of @xmath2 .",
    "for any @xmath41 in @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 .",
    "also , each element @xmath48 of @xmath44 is in such a fundamental circuit , for if @xmath48 were not , then all elements of @xmath46 would be in @xmath49 , so @xmath50 would be a flat , contrary to @xmath45 being cyclic .",
    "thus , @xmath45 is the closure of @xmath51 .",
    "note that @xmath52 , so @xmath45 is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "thus , as needed , the cyclic flats of @xmath2 are the sets @xmath56 .    after ( re)discovering theorem  [ thm : alllattices ] , we learned of the work of sims  @xcite extending dilworth s embedding theorem  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 14.1 ) to rank - finite independence spaces and lattices of finite length .",
    "her approach has much in common with dilworth s and gives the lattice of cyclic flats as a sublattice of the lattice of flats .",
    "dilworth s proof was very influential in the development of the theory of submodular functions .",
    "we note that a minor modification of the proof above gives a short , geometric proof of a strengthening of dilworth s theorem : for each finite lattice @xmath0 , there is a transversal matroid @xmath2 for which ( i ) @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath3 and ( ii ) @xmath3 is a sublattice of the lattice of flats of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , adapt the construction as follows : for each @xmath57 , instead of putting one point freely in the flat spanned by @xmath42 , put a set @xmath58 of @xmath59 points freely in this flat , where @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and then delete @xmath5 to get a transversal matroid @xmath2 .",
    "the cyclic flats of @xmath2 are the sets @xmath62 ; also , @xmath63 , so the meet in @xmath3 is that of the lattice of flats ; the joins in these lattices always agree , thus giving the sublattice assertion .",
    "since transversal matroids are representable over the reals , the counterpart of theorem  [ thm : alllattices ] holds for real matroids . it is natural to ask what other classes of matroids have a counterpart of this result .",
    "our next goal ( theorem  [ thm : gfqdonotcover ] ) is to show that matroids representable over @xmath64 do not have this property .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : gfqdonotcover ] uses the class of nested matroids , which also appears in section  [ sec : cw ] .",
    "nested matroid _ is a matroid that can be obtained from the empty matroid by iterating the operations of adding isthmuses and taking free extensions .",
    "nested matroids have appeared several times in the literature ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) for references ) .",
    "they are a subclass of bitransversal matroids .",
    "the following observations about the operations used to construct nested matroids will be useful . for a single - element extension @xmath65 of @xmath2 , the lattices @xmath3 and @xmath66 are equal if and only if the element of @xmath67 is an isthmus of @xmath65 .",
    "the lattice @xmath68 of the free extension of @xmath2 is formed from @xmath3 by removing @xmath69 , if it is in @xmath3 , and adjoining @xmath12 to @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath0 is the lattice of cyclic flats of some matroid and @xmath70 is disjoint from @xmath16 , then the following construction gives all matroids @xmath2 for which @xmath3 is @xmath71 :    * start with any matroid @xmath72 for which @xmath73 is @xmath16 and @xmath74 is @xmath0 , * partition @xmath70 into two nonempty subsets @xmath75 and @xmath76 , * take the direct sum of @xmath72 and the free matroid on @xmath75 to get @xmath77 , * take free extensions of @xmath77 by the elements in @xmath76 to get @xmath78 , and finally * let @xmath2 be the direct sum of @xmath78 and any free matroid .    note",
    "that in steps ( 2)(4 ) , only the cardinalities @xmath79 and @xmath80 , not the elements in these sets , matter .",
    "these observations give us the following result , which is essentially lemma  2 of  @xcite .",
    "recall that a chain is a linearly ordered set .",
    "[ lem : nested ] a matroid @xmath2 is nested if and only if @xmath3 is a chain .",
    "we now show that some lattices do not arise as the lattice of cyclic flats of any matroid that is representable over @xmath64 .",
    "[ thm : gfqdonotcover ] for a prime power @xmath81 , if @xmath3 is a chain with @xmath82 or more elements , then @xmath2 is not representable over @xmath64 .",
    "we show that if @xmath3 is a chain with @xmath83 elements , then @xmath2 has @xmath84 as a minor ; thus if @xmath85 , then @xmath2 is not representable over @xmath64 .",
    "let the cyclic flats of @xmath2 be @xmath86 .",
    "by lemma  [ lem : nested ] , @xmath2 is a nested matroid , so @xmath87 , for @xmath88 , is obtained by partitioning @xmath89 into nonempty sets @xmath90 and @xmath91 , taking the direct sum of @xmath92 and the free matroid on @xmath90 , and then taking free extensions by the elements in @xmath91 .",
    "therefore the minor @xmath93 has just two cyclic flats , namely , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and so is a uniform matroid ; that the rank and nullity of this uniform minor are at least @xmath8 and @xmath96 , respectively , completes the proof .",
    "in this section we formulate the definition of a matroid using cyclic flats and their ranks .",
    "the mixed character of this axiom scheme sets it apart from most others : it is built jointly on lattice properties ( but using only some of the flats ) and partial information about the rank function .",
    "we will use the following characterization of independent sets and circuits in terms of cyclic flats and their ranks .",

    "statement ( i ) is immediate . as the minimal dependent sets ,",
    "the circuits are the minimal sets @xmath100 with @xmath103 for some cyclic flat @xmath17 ; since @xmath17 can be @xmath104 , this property can be replaced by the simpler one in statement ( ii ) .    to motivate our main result ,",

    "next , if @xmath17 and @xmath109 are in @xmath3 and @xmath110 , then @xmath111 since @xmath112 has no isthmuses . finally ,",
    "since for cyclic flats @xmath17 and @xmath109 we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 , we get the following specialization of semimodularity : @xmath115 we next show that these properties give an axiom scheme for matroids .",
