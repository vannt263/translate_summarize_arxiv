    "deuteron ( @xmath2 ) scattering from a nucleus @xmath3 , consisting of @xmath3 nucleons , microscopically is an @xmath4 body problem .",
    "while various @xmath5 cases have been considered using approximate methods @xcite , a rigorous solution of exact scattering equations @xcite has been achieved so far for three- and four - body systems only @xcite .",
    "in addition , there exist also numerous approximate treatments for three - body reactions @xcite .",
    "to apply the available three - body techniques to deuteron - nucleus scattering , this process is often approximated by a three - body problem where the nuclear core @xmath3 is treated as a structureless particle whose interaction with the proton ( @xmath6 ) and the neutron ( @xmath7 ) is given by complex or real potentials . in some cases",
    "this may be a reasonable approach , but in others it is necessary to go beyond the picture of an inert core @xmath3 and take into account its internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been shown in several works @xcite that the excitation of the core may be an important reaction mechanism and needs to be taken into account .",
    "there are several formulations of rigorous three - body scattering equations including core excitation ( cex ) @xcite , however , numerical results were obtained only in ref .  @xcite . as dynamic input",
    "these calculations use nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) and nucleon - core ( @xmath9 ) interactions .",
    "there is a number of standard parametrizations for @xmath9 optical potentials ( op ) without cex .",
    "the cex is usually included by deforming these standard potentials to allow the coupling between ground ( @xmath3 ) and excited ( @xmath10 ) states of the core . however , this way the additional @xmath11 component in the two - body scattering equation together with the potential deformation distort the elastic @xmath9 amplitude that deviates from the original elastic amplitude calculated using standard potential without cex .",
    "the latter is usually fitted to the @xmath12 elastic experimental data , thus , the description of the data gets destroyed when including the cex via the simple deformation of the potential .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath13 coupling potential was fitted to the inelastic @xmath14 data using the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) which is the usual case , the fit to @xmath14 data is lost as well .",
    "thus , an additional adjustment of the op parameters needs to be performed to restore the description of @xmath9 elastic and inelastic scattering data .",
    "this implies a new fit procedure for each nucleus at each energy , which may be quite tedious . on the other hand",
    ", one may take the advantage of already existing fits to the experimental data obtained using dwba and standard op .",
    "for this a @xmath9 potential with cex is needed that , when inserted into the exact two - body multichannel lippmann - schwinger equation , yields the standard op results for the @xmath12 elastic scattering and dwba results for the @xmath14 reaction . in the present work",
    "i propose a method for achieving this goal , i.e. , i construct a @xmath9 potential with cex that at a given energy exactly reproduces the standard op and dwba amplitudes for @xmath12 and @xmath14 scattering processes , respectively .",
    "thus , the desired consistency with the @xmath9 experimental data is ensured . in case",
    "there are no data available , this approach still allows for a more precise evaluation of the cex effect , not affected by the op mismatch . in three - body systems",
    "i aim to study the changes in observables caused by this improvement of the op .",
    "i therefore reanalyze the reactions calculated in ref .",

    "i employ the extended hilbert space @xmath18 where the two sectors correspond to the core being in its ground ( g ) or excited ( x ) state @xcite .",

    "i emphasize that the extended free hamiltonian @xmath26 besides the kinetic energy operator contains also the internal core hamiltonian whose contribution vanishes for @xmath27 but is equal to the core excitation energy @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",

    "the particles are represented by vertical lines , the core in its excited state is distinguished by thick lines , the potential by horizontal dashed lines . the diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) correspond to @xmath19 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath20 . ]    at energy @xmath32 the component @xmath33 describing the @xmath9 elastic scattering is demanded to reproduce the transition matrix @xmath34 obtained with the @xmath9 potential @xmath35 not including cex , usually taken from one of the standard parametrizations .",
    "there is no such demand for @xmath36 due to the lack of the experimental data for the @xmath11 elastic scattering .",
    "the respective transition matrix for the core in its excited state but without coupling to the ground state @xmath37 is obtained with the @xmath11 potential @xmath38 that is not constrained by the data but is usually taken from the same standard op parametrization as @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath32 i also require @xmath39 to reproduce the dwba amplitude @xmath40 the potential @xmath41 coupling the two hilbert sectors @xmath27 and @xmath29 usually is obtained by deforming the central part of @xmath35 . in the rotational model @xcite",
    "one assumes that the core has a permanent quadrupole deformation and replaces in @xmath35 the nuclear radius @xmath42 by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the quadrupole deformation parameter and @xmath45 describes the internal core degrees of freedom in the body - fixed frame . if the central part of @xmath35 is a function of @xmath46 , e.g. , the woods - saxon function , @xmath41 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the respective projectors and @xmath49 is the deformation length .    to fulfill the above demands , @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) is resolved as @xmath50 and used in this for the @xmath33 component , leading to @xmath51 furthermore , i make use of the identity @xmath52 obtained from eq .",

    "thus , the essential idea of the present method is subtracting from the elastic amplitude the contributions that are explicitly generated in the scattering equations by the coupling to the core excited state .",
    "for this reason it is called the subtraction method .",
    "the subtracted contributions at the two lowest orders are diagrammatically represented in fig .",

    "note that a similar subtraction method has been used in the past to readjust the purely nucleonic part of the two - nucleon potential with explicit @xmath57-isobar excitation @xcite , thereby improving the fit of the elastic two - nucleon scattering data .",
    "the present method is more general in the sense that it also fixes the inelastic amplitude .",

    "they acquire the standard form of the ags integral equations for three - body transition operators @xmath58 that couple the two sectors @xmath27 and @xmath29 much like the two - body transition operators @xmath59 in eq .",

    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 cores the ground ( first excited ) states have spin and parity @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , while the respective excitation energies are 3.368 and 1.369 mev .",
    "the main goal is to evaluate the changes in the observables due to the use of the improved nucleon - core potential including the cex with subtraction .",
    "i present three types of calculations .",
    "all of them use a realistic cd bonn potential @xcite for the @xmath66 pair , but differ in @xmath9 interactions : ( i ) single - particle ( sp ) model for the core , i.e. , neglecting cex in @xmath9 potentials , labeled as sp in the following ; ( ii ) including cex via simple deformation of the sp potential without subtraction and readjustment , labeled cx(no subtr ) in the following ; and ( iii ) including cex using improved @xmath9 potentials with subtraction and proper readjustment as described in sec .",

    "thus , the difference between cx and sp will yield the the cex effect , while the difference between cx and cx ( no subtr ) will evaluate the importance of the potential improvement .",

    "@xcite , but cx(no subtr ) was labeled simply cx in ref .",
    "i therefore only have to describe the calculations cx with subtraction . for the @xmath67 pair in the partial waves with @xmath68 bound states",
    "i take over the real binding potentials from ref .",
    "@xcite since they are already adjusted to experimental binding energies and need no subtraction .",
    "depending on the partial wave , these potentials may support deeply bound states @xmath69 that are pauli forbidden and therefore have to be projected out ; this is achieved by adding a separable term @xmath70 with @xmath71 gev to the local @xmath67 potential and thereby moving the pauli forbidden state @xmath69 to a large positive energy @xcite . for @xmath67 in other partial waves and for @xmath72 in all partial waves i take the potentials including cex with subtraction ; they are derived from the ch89 parametrization unless explicitly stated otherwise .",

    "however , if the @xmath67 potential is complex in all partial waves as in the case of the present @xmath17 calculations , the @xmath76 channel is absent and therefore the @xmath72 potential is taken at @xmath77 as well .",
