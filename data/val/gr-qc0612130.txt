    "thermal fluctuations of mechanical systems are considered the most relevant limitation of ground based interferometers for gravitational waves detection in the low frequency region , where several gravitational wave signals are expected@xcite .",
    "the statistical behavior is well described by the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , which states a general relationship between the response of a given system to an external disturbance and the internal fluctuation of the system in the absence of the disturbance .",
    "such a response is characterized by a response function or equivalently by an admittance , or an impedance @xcite .",
    "the test masses for gravitational wave interferometer are complex mechanical systems where contributions to the thermal noise come from different elements of the structure : the suspension wires of the mirror , the mirror bulk and the mirror coating , which is considered one of most severe thermal noise source for the present and near future detectors , just to mention a few of them .",
    "measurements devoted to the evaluation of different dissipation mechanisms and of the parameters describing them , are often performed on resonance .",
    "just a few experimental apparatus have been conceived to measure the thermal noise spectrum out of resonance and in the frequency region above @xmath6 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the low frequency facility ( lff ) is the test bench on top of which the italian r&d program of the virgo experiment is based on .",
    "its main purpose is the relative displacement measurement of two suspended mirrors forming a high finesse fabry - perot cavity suspended from a seismic isolation system and the study of the thermal noise spectrum in the region starting from @xmath7 @xmath1@xcite .",
    "this is made possible by a superattenuator ( sa ) , very similar to the ones installed in virgo , at the infn pisa laboratory .",
    "care has been used in designing and assembling this experiment in order to keep the experimental apparatus as close as possible to the virgo s suspensions . moreover , since the seismic noise reduction to the payload level is very large , the lff represents also an independent benchmark of the virgo suspension behavior in the low frequency region .",
    "recently , data collected at the lff has shown the presence of an optical spring due to the radiation pressure noise of the system @xcite . within the frequency band",
    "@xmath8 @xmath1 this thermal - noise dominated system is unique as well as the presence of the optical spring acting between two mirrors of the cavity .",
    "the first section of this paper shortly describes the experimental apparatus .",
    "an introduction of the mechanical model reproducing the experimental measurements is presented in the second section . within the third section",
    "is focused on the evaluation of the main noise coming from external sources in lff . in the last section , before the conclusions , a general overview on the measured spectra is given , paying particular attention to the main characteristics of the thermal noise driven mechanisms .",
    "then the absorption coefficients found fitting the data with the model are discussed .",
    "last stage of the experimental apparatus is sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : eletmec ] while a more detailed description can be found in references @xcite .",
    "the reflectivity , transmission and loss ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 respectively ) of the two mirrors used in our set - up are given in table [ table_optics ] together with the nominal cavity finesse and the laser input power .",
    "rfc ( reference cavity ) and the suspended mirrors ( enclosed in figure in grey boxes ) are in vacuum",
    ".    .optical parameters of the cavity [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the system is affected by different noise sources entering through different dissipation mechanism , fig .",
    "[ fig : feed ] shows the control loop , the acquired signals and the external noises entering in the system .",
    "this implies that the model should account for the possibility of changing the entering position of the noise sources ( physically resembling the different sources affecting different stage of the electro mechanical system ) . in particular , the critical points are suspension , mirror , electronic noise of the dsp and coil driver . + the thermal noise of a mechanical system can be calculated using the fluctuation dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "the theorem defines a relation between the frequency distribution of thermal noise in a system and the mechanical admittance @xmath13 , which is the ratio between the resulting velocity and the applied force ( i.e. the transfer function of the velocity as a function of the applied force ) : @xmath14 specifically , the displacement spectral density is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath17 the temperature and @xmath13 the admittance , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the frequency . in our case @xmath20 is the distance from the resonance point of the cavity , as well as the relative motion of the two mirrors of the cavity , also called error signal of the feed - back longitudinal control loop .",
    "the model takes into account the rotational degree of freedom that can be excited by an off - axis beam , necessary since the beam hits the mirror few millimeters far from the center .",
    "this has been done by adding a single equation to the model , thus considering the flat mirror as a single oscillator of given momentum of inertia and a proper frequency around @xmath4 @xmath1 , as experimentally observed .",
    "this approximated models held because the proper frequencies of multi - pendulum suspension are well below the range analyzed in this context .",
    "the elastic constant of the rotation is @xmath21 @xmath22 , with a inertial moment of the mirror @xmath23 @xmath24 , the misalignment between the vertical rotational axis of the ax mirror and the point where the radiation pressure force is applied is @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "+ to take into account the losses we add inside the equation of motion a term proportional to the velocity ( viscous damping ) or we multiply the spring constants by @xmath27 ( structural damping ) , where @xmath28 is the loss angle ( usually considered constant and smaller than @xmath29)@xcite .",
    "+ in the model only two dissipation terms have been considered : pure viscous damping acting on the longitudinal degree of freedom , and the other acting on the rotational one of the ax mirror .",
    "this simple choice is based on the fact that the ax pendulum has larger thermal noise , since its mass is @xmath6 times lighter than the other .",
    "moreover we can assess which dissipation mechanisms is dominant by analyzing the different frequency behavior , under the assumption that the absorption parameters are constant with the frequency .",
    "+ assuming that the control loop does not introduce noise @xcite , the model evaluates the thermal noise contribution to the relative motion @xmath20 of the mirror of the cavity in the following way :    * in the open loop case , the mechanical impedance is evaluated by applying two equal and opposite forces to the two mirrors of the cavity , in the model the optical spring is described by a standard stiffness * the thermal noise power spectrum of @xmath20 is evaluated by using f - d - t * the stochastic forces are evaluated by the thermal noise power spectrum of @xmath20 and the model * the closed loop motion , to be compared with the measurement , is evaluated by applying the thermal stochastic forces to the mirrors in the closed loop equations * free parameters are the absorption coefficients and the optical spring stiffness , which are derived by fitting the data with the model .",
    "figure  [ fig : thermal_all ] shows the thermal noise spectra in the following cases : open loop with and without optical spring and the closed loop with optical spring ( using the typical feed - back parameters used in the runs which have been analyzed ) .",
    "few peaks are evident in the spectrum : the @xmath30 @xmath1 peak is related to the existence of the small clamp @xmath31 , all the others have not been identified .",
    "some of the peaks are not stationary ; comparing the data of two different time periods of a single acquisition run , it has been checked that the peak heights are enhanced while the noise floor remain unaffected @xcite .",
    "for this reason those peaks are not crucial for the comprehension of the noise floor ; they are related even to the excitation of degrees of freedom orthogonal to the longitudinal one , or through the input beam which is in air , or to spurious electromagnetic couplings . + in the following the measured power spectrum will be compared with all the external noise sources .",
    "thanks to the fact that the measurement is stationary , all not stationary noise sources ( as doppler shift due to the jitter of the injection beam , excited by seismic noise or by fluctuations of the air pressure induced by sound ) are ruled out .",
    "as earlier mentioned , the different noise sources enter the system at different points , see fig .",
    "[ fig : feed ] .",
    "while seismic noise enters only through the suspension , electronic noise comes in through several ports : the laser ( frequency and amplitude jitters ) , the mixer , the photodiode , the adc , the dac and the coil drivers .",
    "direct measurement of the electronic noise has shown that the main contributions come from adc and dac .",
    "the electronic noise of the dac and the driver can not produce the measured spectrum . in order to produce a power spectrum similar to the measured one , the noise of the dac should be @xmath32 @xmath33 , which is more than a factor @xmath6 higher that the measured dac noise .",
    "+ signals are acquired just before the dac ( coil2 ) and after at the level of the coil ( probe , current flowing in the coil ) ; the coherence of the signal coil2 with the signal probe is very high , over @xmath34 above @xmath7 @xmath1 : this confirms that the dac noise is negligible .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : tfmn ] shows the ratio between a noise injected before the dsp filter ( as noise from the laser , mixer , photodiode and adc noise ) and the error signal ; fig .",
    "[ fig : tfmn ] shows that a white noise would not reproduce the data in the frequency band @xmath0 @xmath1 .        in order to match the @xmath35 @xmath1 peak a noise with a spectral density of @xmath36 @xmath33",
    "should be injected . on the other hand",
    "the adc noise spectrum is white and its value is a factor @xmath6 lower . + the frequency jitter of the nd - yag laser is one of the most important noise sources .",
    "for this reason , as we said before , we set -up a laser frequency stabilization loop which should limit the fluctuations at the @xmath37 level . however , since we havent an independent reference cavity to perform a direct measurement of the residual noise , we have a strong evidence that this noise source does not contribute significantly to the noise floor of our set up . first all we notice that , in order to reproduce the measured power spectrum level around the optical spring resonance , we need a noise frequency jitter of @xmath38 @xmath39 . this value is just a factor @xmath40 below the measured laser frequency jitter in absence of stabilization .",
    "moreover , we were able to evaluate an upper limit for the integrated frequency jitter with the following independent measurement . before the runs , for calibration purposes ,",
    "the p - d - h reflected signal was recorded , at @xmath41 @xmath42 acquisition rate , with the cavity out of lock .",
    "each point taken in the linear region of the p - d - h signal has an error due to the frequency and amplitude jitter of the laser , and any other possible noise source , integrated from @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xmath42 . among all the recorded data",
    "an event has been selected , with over @xmath45 points in the linear region : the cavity was moving slowly and with constant speed .",
    "thirty six points have been recorded close to the linear region or the p - d - h signal , the data have been fitted with a polynomial up to ninth order .",
    "the difference between the points and the polynomial is a estimation of the noise affecting the measurement integrated from zero up to @xmath44 @xmath42 .",
    "the standard deviation of this noise is @xmath46 @xmath47 , incompatible with a power spectrum density of @xmath48 @xmath33 . in figures  [ fig : freq ] the data ,",
    "the residuals of the fit are shown .",
    "+ a detailed analysis of the seismic noise contamination can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we recall that the contamination of seismic noise at @xmath7 @xmath1 is below @xmath49 @xmath50 for the virgo interferometer test masses .",
    "the study presented here is based on a set of data collected in different working conditions but with similar control loop gain and the test performed confirms compatibility of the data with the thermal noise prediction . as mentioned in a previous paragraph",
    "the most important signal used in our analysis is that related to the cavity de - tuning ( closed loop error signal ) obtained by reconstructing the signal output of the dsp ( coil2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : eletmec ] ) .",
    "indeed , this signal is acquired after a two poles butterworth filter , which selects the frequency range @xmath51 @xmath1 .",
    "the region of the spectrum below @xmath4 @xmath1 is dominated by the seismic noise and it has been cut off by an other high pass filter applied to the data .",
    "+ by means of the horde software routine of the matlab software package , we checked that data follow the gaussian statistical distribution , while the data stationary has been checked by looking at the time - frequency spectrograms of the data .",
    "+ according to the reference @xcite an independent check of the data stationary for a thermal noise dominated system can be evaluated averaging the product between the speed and the acceleration of the observed system ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the speed and the acceleration ) .",
    "this parameter should vanish if the system is thermal noise dominated .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig : speedacc ] shows the distribution of the mentioned parameter ( the average of the product between the speed and the acceleration of the system ) averaged on increasing time interval and for frequencies below @xmath6 @xmath1 .",
    "the speed and the acceleration have been obtained differentiating the displacement measurements .",
    "+ as stated by the boltzman s law , the distribution of the speed @xmath55 for an oscillator excited by the thermal noise should be : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the oscillator mass , @xmath58 is the boltzmann s constant and t the absolute temperature .",
    "moreover , the variance @xmath59 of the distribution @xmath60 for a free oscillating system ( not feedback controlled ) is defined by the mechanical parameters .",
    "our measurements have been performed with an active feedback loop which does not influence the distribution of the data but changes the absolute value of the variance itself . in principle",
    "the variance @xmath59 , for a closed loop case , could be reconstructed integrating the expected power spectrum all over the frequency band .",
    "the comparison between the measured spectrum and the predicted one , is the most reliable method to prove that the data are thermal noise dominated .",
    "thus , we checked that the energy associated with the mirror ax , integrating the power spectrum between @xmath4 and @xmath6 @xmath1 , is below @xmath61 ( @xmath62 k ) .",
    "kubo@xcite states that for a system at the thermal equilibrium the admittance @xmath13 can be evaluated by the fourier transform integrated from zero to infinity of the autocorrelation function of the speed . from the knowledge of @xmath13 it is possible to reconstruct the power spectrum from the fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "let @xmath63 be the displacement filtered by the feedback loops and by the filters of the acquisition system .",
    "the following relation held for the power spectrum of @xmath63 : @xmath64 + in fig .",
    "[ fig : kubo ] the @xmath65 is evaluated both directly from the data and applying the above equation .",
    "the agreement is good in particular in the region of the optical spring resonance and at higher frequencies . at lower frequency",
    "the stretch of data is too short to be used for deriving a significant estimation of the power spectrum on the base of the formula reported above .",
    "the good agreement shown is not sufficient to demonstrate that our measurements are thermal noise dominated .",
    "it represents just an efficient cross - check performed using uncalibrated and unfiltered data .",
    "+ to evaluate the thermal noise contribution to the data we used our model to best fit the data . first all , we derived the absorption coefficient @xmath66 @xmath67 , associated to the longitudinal motion of ax , by fitting the data selected around the optical spring resonance @xmath68 @xmath1 , while the other @xmath69 @xmath67 is found by fitting the data in the interval @xmath70 @xmath1,where there is the anti - resonance .",
    "+ in the figure  [ fig : mismatch ] we show the measured spectrum and the thermal noise contribution estimated by best fitting the data with the model for an optical gain @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "similar results have been obtained by analyzing the data of independent runs .",
    "+ it has been also checked that present measurement is not compatible with the structural damping .",
    "as it is shown in figure [ fig : mismatch ] , the result of the fit and the data well agree below @xmath5 @xmath1 , at higher frequency the higher order modes are relevant , and the model can not reproduce the data .",
    "+ the mirrors are attached through wires , with diameter @xmath75 @xmath76 , which in principle should be treated in the model as continuous system .",
    "the family of transversal modes of the wires ( violin modes ) starts around @xmath6 @xmath1 .",
    "it has been checked with the model that higher internal modes of the mirrors and violin modes of the wires , change the slope of the power spectrum above @xmath6 @xmath1 , and increases the level at lower frequency .",
    "the present set of data shows the power spectrum below @xmath77 @xmath1 and it is impossible to further constrain the model by adding higher order modes , since the high frequency resonance can not be identified .",
    "as far as the frequency region below @xmath4 @xmath1 is concerned , we said before that we did not include in the model the super attenuator oscillation modes .",
    "however , a more detailed model would not improve the analysis , since this part of the spectrum is contaminated by seismic noise .",
    "+ we notice that the absorptions coefficients are about @xmath7 times larger than those measured in virgo .",
    "the lff apparatus is not as performing as virgo from the point of view of the losses due by mechanical dissipation .",
    "in fact , the lff apparatus has not been constructed with all the care used for the virgo antenna ; for example three wire loops are attached to the ax mirror , the wires diameter is rather large ( @xmath78 @xmath79 ) , the two wire loops holding the mirror are attached to a motor used to align horizontally the cavity . due to the fact that the difference in length of the two wires loop , only @xmath4 @xmath26 apart , was causing a large vertical misalignment ,",
    "it has been necessary to change the length of one of the two wires loops by using a clamp , which is attached directly to the wires of one of the two loops .",
    "this clamp consists of two pieces and a screw , which changes the distance between the two pieces , and accordingly the effective length of one of the two wires loop , thus making it possible to bend the ax mirror . + in the model the losses are associated to the ax mirror motion , and the higher order mechanical modes of the system are not taken into account .",
    "indeed we checked that higher order modes can contribute in decreasing the absorption coefficients .",
    "+ moreover , we notice that the the values of the two @xmath80 coefficients resulting from the data fit depend also on the absolute calibration : in particular they decrease when the optical gain is increased . for example , assuming a optical gain @xmath81 @xmath72 , the fit gives @xmath82 @xmath67 and @xmath83 @xmath67 .",
    "the calibration of the lff apparatus so far relies on measurements taken when the cavity feedback is off ( open loop condition ) .",
    "the actuator system is calibrated applying a slowly increasing voltage to the coil drivers and we count the number of free spectral ranges transmitted by the cavity . in practice ,",
    "the optical read out is calibrated by looking at the pound - drever signal ; the two sidebands @xmath84 @xmath85 apart , set the scale for the absolute calibration . in order to improve the calibration accuracy of the measurement",
    ", it would be necessary to have an independent system pushing the mirror of a know amount during the data taking based for example on the radiation pressure effect of an independent laser light , amplitude modulated at a fixed frequency impinging on the ax mirror . would move the ax mirror of @xmath86 @xmath57 , at @xmath44 @xmath1 , if the optical spring is @xmath87 @xmath74 . with the use of this calibrator it would be possible to directly excites the system for a direct measurement of the absorption mechanisms , on resonance and outside resonance .",
    "a @xmath2 @xmath3 fabry - perot cavity is suspended using a super attenuator chain equal to the ones used for the virgo antenna .",
    "this cavity has been locked for several hours , and the data analyzed off-line.the output signal exhibits a statistical behavior a displacement power spectrum compatible with the condition of a system at its thermal equilibrium .",
    "we developed a simple opto - mechanical model which include the various noise sources of the system and we evaluated the thermal noise contribution applying the fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "two viscous dissipation coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 , constant in frequency , associated with the longitudinal and rotational motion of the lighter test mass of @xmath90 @xmath91 , are used in the model to fit the data ; the fit results gives @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath69 @xmath67 .",
    "different runs give similar results .",
    "in particular the measured power spectrum is reproduced in the region @xmath8 @xmath1 under the hypothesis that it is thermal noise dominated .",
    "we checked that the measured power spectrum can not be produced by external noise sources , as noise of the laser and electronics and that the other noise source in the control loop are not contributing significantly .",
