    "these notes are a somewhat expanded version of lectures given at the epf lausanne under the troisieme cycle de la suisse romande programme in november 1998 , and later at the 12th chris engelbrecht summer school held at stellenbosch in january - february 1999 .",
    "the lectures were intended to provide a pedagogical introduction to the abelian sandpile model and related models .",
    "here , i have tried to fill in some of the details left out in the oral presentations .",
    "even so , the treatment is not self- contained , and algebraic details have sometimes been omitted in favor of citation to original papers .",
    "it is hoped that these notes will be useful as a starting point for students wanting to learn about the subject in detail , and also to others only seeking an overview of the subject .    in these notes ,",
    "the main concern is the analysis of a particular model of self - organized criticality ( soc ) : the so - called abelian sandpile model ( asm ) , and its related models : the voter model , the @xmath0 limit of the @xmath1-state potts model , scheidegger s model of river networks , the eulerian walkers model , the abelian distributed processors model etc .",
    "the main appeal of these models is that they are analytically tractable .",
    "one can explicitly calculate many quantities of interest , such as properties of the steady state , and some critical exponents , without too much effort . as such , they are very useful for developing our understanding of the basic principles and mechanisms underlying the general theory .",
    "a student could think of the asm as a ` base camp ' for the explorations into the uncharted areas of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the exact results in this case can also serve as proving grounds for developing approximate treatments for more realistic problems .    while these models are rather simple to define , and in some sense soluble , they are non - trivial , and can not be said to be well - understood yet .",
    "for example , it has not been possible so far to determine the critical exponents for avalanche distributions for the undirected sandpile model in two or three dimensions . the fairly large analytical and numerical effort devoted to this question in two dimensions",
    "has produced only partial results .",
    "there are many questions still unanswered .",
    "( some will be discussed later in the lectures . )",
    "one may hope that these lectures will encourage further work in this area , which will lead to a better understanding of some of them",
    ".    our focus here will be on the mathematical development of these models . however , it is useful to start with a brief discussion of their origin as simplified models of physical phenomena .",
    "the term soc was first coined by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) in their well - known paper in 1987 @xcite .",
    "they observed that many naturally occuring phenomena display fractal behavior .",
    "examples include mountain ranges , river networks , coastlines , etc .",
    "the word ` fractal structure ' here means that some correlation functions show non - trivial power law behavior .",
    "for example , in the case of mountain ranges , the irregular height profile can be characterized by how the difference of height @xmath2 , between two points separated by a distance @xmath3 varies with @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that @xmath4 ^ 2\\right > \\sim r^x\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes averaging over different spatial points at the fixed horizontal separation @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is some non - trivial power . from simple physical considerations ,",
    "we see that @xmath7 . when measured , the exponent @xmath6 seems to vary little between one mountain range and another .    in the case of river networks ,",
    "the fractal structure can be characterized in terms of the empirical hack s law @xcite .",
    "this law describes how the catchment area of any particular stream in a river basin grows as we go down - stream along the river .",
    "if @xmath8 is the catchment area , and @xmath9 is the length of the principal stream up to this point , hack s law states that on the average @xmath8 grows as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is some exponent , @xmath12 .    in other examples the fractal behavior",
    "is found not in the spatial structure itself , but is manifest the power - law dependence between some physical observables .",
    "for example , in the case of earthquakes , the frequency of earthquake of total energy @xmath13 is found to vary as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a number close to 2 , for many decades of the energy range .",
    "( this is the well - known gutenberg - richter law @xcite ) .",
    "an example in a similar spirit is that of fluid turbulence where the fractal behavior is observed in the way mean squared velocity difference scales with distance , or in the spatial fractal structure of regions of high dissipation . many time - series like electrical noise , stock market price variations etc .",
    "show power - law tails in their power spectra [ ` @xmath16 ' noise ] .",
    "for an overview of application of the soc idea to different natural systems , see @xcite .",
    "systems exhibiting such correlations with power law decay over a wide range of length scales are said to have critical correlations .",
    "this is because correlations much larger than the length - scale of interactions were first studied in equilibrium statistical mechanics in the neighborhood of a critical phase transition . in order to observe such critical phenomena in equilibrium systems",
    ", one needs to fine - tune some physical parameters ( such as the temperature and pressure ) to specific critical values , something rather unlikely to occur in a naturally occuring process such as the growth of a mountain range and its erosion .",
    "the systems we want to study may be said to be in a steady state as while there is variation in time , average properties are roughly unchanged with time .",
    "however , these systems are not in equilibrium : they are open and disssipative systems which require input of energy from outside at a constant rate to offset the dissipation .",
    "we define such states to be _ non - equilibrium steady states_.    btw argued that the dynamics which give rise to the robust power - law correlations seen in the non - equilibrium steady states in nature must not involve any fine - tuning of parameters",
    ". it must be such that the systems under their natural evolution are driven to a state at the boundary between the stable and unstable states .",
    "such a state then shows long range spatio - temporal fluctuations similar to those in equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "al . proposed a simple example of a system whose natural dynamics drives it towards , and then maintains it , at the edge of stability : a sandpile .",
    "it is observed that for dry sand , one can characterize its macroscopic behavior in terms of an angle @xmath17 , called the angle of repose , which depends on the detailed structure ( size , shapes and roughness etc . ) of the constituting grains @xcite . if we make a sandpile in which the local slope is smaller than @xmath17 everywhere , such a pile is stable .",
    "on such a pile , addition of a small amount of sand will cause only a weak response , but adding a small amount of sand to a configuration where the average slope is larger than @xmath17 , will often result in an avalanche whose size is of the order of the system size . in a pile where the average slope is @xmath17 ,",
    "the response to addition of sand is less predictable . it might cause almost no relaxation , or it may cause avalanches of intermediate sizes , or a catastrophic avalanche which affects the entire system .",
    "such a state is critical .",
    "btw observed that if one builds a sandpile on a finite table by pouring it very slowly , the system is invariably driven towards its critical state , and thus organizes itself into a critical state : it shows soc .",
    "the steady state of this process is characterized by the following property : sand is being added to the system at a constant small rate , but it leaves the system in a very irregular manner , with long periods of apparent inactivity interspersed by events which may vary in size and which occur at unpredictable intervals ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    [ sandsch ]",
    "a similar behavior is seen in earthquakes , where the build - up of stress due to tectonic motion of the continental plates is a slow steady process , but the release of stress occurs sporadically in bursts of various sizes .",
    "some people have objected to the term soc , arguing that in fact self - organized systems are not so different from ordinary critical systems , because here the driving rate is the parameter which is being fine - tuned to zero . we need not worry too much about this terminological dispute , and prefer to adopt the point of view that fine tuning to zero is not ` unnatural ' , is easily realized experimentally , and often occurs in nature",
    ".    the first step in the study of soc would be the precise mathematical formulation of some simple model which exhibits it .",
    "from this introduction it follows that such a system should have the necessary features of soc systems : it should be _ extended , open , dissipative and non - linear_. all these properties makes such systems hard to treat analytically using the tools familiar to theoretical physicists .",
    "in their original paper @xcite , bak tang and wiesenfeld also proposed a simple cellular automaton model of sandpile growth .",
    "the model is defined on a lattice , which we take for simplicity to be the two dimensional square lattice .",
    "there is a positive integer variable at each site of the lattice , called the height of the sandpile at that site .",
    "the system evolves in discrete time .",
    "the rules of evolution are quite simple : at each time step a site is picked randomly , and its height @xmath18 is increased by unity . if its height is then larger than a critical height @xmath19 , this site is said to be unstable .",
    "it relaxes by toppling whereby four sand grains leave the site , and each of the four neighboring sites gets one grain .",
    "if there is any unstable site remaining , it too is toppled . in case of toppling at a site at the boundary of the lattice ,",
    "grains falling ` outside ' the lattice are removed from the system .",
    "this process continues until all sites are stable .",
    "then another site is picked randomly , its height increased , and so on . to make the rules unambiguous , the toppling of sites which were rendered unstable during the same time step is defined to be carried out in parallel .",
    "it is easy to show that this process must converge to a stable configuration in a finite number of time steps on any finite lattice using the diffusive nature of each relaxation step ( proof omitted ) .",
    "the following example illustrates the toppling rules .",
    "let the lattice size be @xmath20 , and suppose at some time step the following configuration is reached : @xmath21 we now add a grain of sand at a randomly selected site : let us say the site on the second row from the top and the third column from the left .",
    "then it will reach height 5 , become unstable and topple to reach @xmath22 and further toppling results in @xmath23    in this configuration all sites are stable .",
    "one speaks in this case of an event of size @xmath24 , since there were 4 topplings .",
    "other measures of event size are the number of distinct sites toppled ( in this case also 4 ) , the number of time steps needed ( 3 in this case ) , and the diameter of the affected area ( 3 ) .",
    "suppose that one measures the relative frequency of event sizes .",
    "a typical distribution would be characterized by a long power law tail , with an eventual cutoff determined by the the system size @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ distsch ]    for readers who may like to write their own simulation program , we add some tips here : to get good statistics , one needs to minimize the finite - size effects .",
    "avalanches that start near the boundary have a different statistics than those that start away from it ( in bulk ) . in the limit of large sizes",
    ", the contribution of boundary avalanches to total goes to zero as @xmath26 . in simulations , one gets much better convergence if the avalanches that start near the boundary are excluded from the data .",
    "else , the distributions for different sizes converge very slowly with @xmath25 even for small avalanche sizes . in fig .",
    "3 , i used a cylinder of size @xmath27 , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath11-direction , and open boundary conditions in the x - direction .",
    "particles were not added with uniform probability everywhere .",
    "the odd - numbered particles were added only along the middle ring away from the boundaries , with all sites on the ring equiprobable .",
    "even - numbered particles were added anywhere on the lattice .",
    "only avalanches resulting from the odd - numbered particles were used for determining the avalanche distributions .",
    "[ we shall show later that this does not affect the answer .",
    "] imposing cylindrical boundary conditions avoids corners , and consequent corrections to bulk behavior .",
    "it is easy to see that in this model , events involving many topplings must occur with significant probability .",
    "since every particle added anywhere in the system finally leaves the system , and on the average it must take at least order @xmath25 steps to reach the boundary , we see that the average number of topplings per added particle is at least of order @xmath25 . in other words ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is some constant @xcite . for large @xmath25 , this tends to infinity .",
    "such a diverging expectation value can not be generated by any distribution for which the probability of avalanches of size _ larger than _ @xmath30 decreases with @xmath30 faster than @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is any positive power .",
    "thus the distribution must be of the type sketched in fig .",
    "3 with a small enough decay exponent .",
    "this argument suggests that so long as sand can leave the system only at the boundaries , the distribution of avalanches must have a power law tail .",
    "in fact , careful experiments with real sand do not see such a tail .",
    "how to reconcile this with the rather robust argument given above ?",
    "it seems that the hypothesis of a single angle of repose is not quite correct .",
    "there are at least two angles : an angle of stability @xmath33 , and an angle of drainage @xmath34 , with @xmath33 greater than @xmath35 by about a couple of degrees .",
    "as we add sand , the slope slowly increases from @xmath34 to @xmath33 , and then there is a single big avalanche and the net slope decreases to @xmath34 . in such a `` charge and fire",
    "'' behavior , the big avalanches are nearly periodic .",
    "speaking mathematically , one can have diverging first moment of a distribution with no power law tail , if the distribution consists of two parts : a small events part which has almost all the weight of the distribution , and a small weight ( of order @xmath36 ) at a rather large value of @xmath37 .",
    "as one needs to build up @xmath38 particles to increase the slope by a finite amount , and in a big event , a particle will move by an amount of order @xmath25 , this corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "of course , the existence of large events does not _ exclude _ a weak power law tail in the small events .",
    "whether real granular media show soc or not seems to depend on the shape of grains .",
    "the scenario outlined above seems to describe sandpiles with roughly spherical grains .",
    "however , if the grains are very rough and of large aspect ratio , they behave differently . in a beautiful series of experiments , frette et al have shown that piles formed of long - grain rice do show soc behavior @xcite .    the btw model is not a very good model of real sand . for realistic modelling of sand , the instability condition should be about a maximum value of the slope , not a maximum value of the height .",
    "such critical slope models are easily defined , but not very tractable analytically . as a pedagogical model to illustrate the basic ideas of soc ,",
    "the critical height model is much better .",
    "the bounded height variables in the btw model may be better viewed as fluctuations about the space - dependent mean height of the pile .",
    "the analytical tractability of the model has led to a lot of interest in the model , and by now there is a fairly large amount of work dealing with this model . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the btw model has an important abelian property that simplifies its analysis considerably . to bring out this abelian property in its full generality ,",
    "it is preferable to work with a generalized sandpile model to be called the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) defined as follows  @xcite :    we consider the model defined on a graph with @xmath40 sites labeled by integers @xmath41 [ fig.4 ] . at each site @xmath42",
    ", the height of the sandpile is given by a positive integer @xmath18 .",
    "at each time step , a site is chosen at random from a given distribution , the probability of site @xmath42 being chosen being @xmath43 .",
    "its height is increased by 1 from @xmath18 to @xmath44 .",
    "we are also given an integer @xmath45 matrix @xmath46 , and a set of @xmath40 integers @xmath47 , @xmath48 to @xmath40 .",
    "if for any site @xmath42 , @xmath49 then the site is said to be unstable , and it topples . on toppling at site @xmath42 , all heights @xmath50 are updated according to the rule    @xmath51    without loss of generality we may choose @xmath52 ( this amounts to a particular choice of the origin of the @xmath18 variables ) . in this case",
    ", the allowed values of @xmath18 in a stable configuration are @xmath53 .",
    "evidently the matrix @xmath46 has to satisfy some conditions to ensure that the model is well behaved .",
    "1 .   @xmath54 , for every @xmath42 .",
    "( otherwise topplings never terminate . ) 2 .   for every pair @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "( this condition is required to establish the abelian property , as will be shown shortly . )",
    "@xmath57 for every @xmath42 .",
    "( this condition states that sand is not generated in the toppling process . )",
    "there is at least one site @xmath42 such that @xmath58 .",
    "such sites are called dissipative sites .",
    "in addition , the matrix @xmath46 is such that in the corresponding directed graph , there is a path of directed links from any site to one of the dissipative sites .",
    "this condition ensures that all avalanches terminate in a finite time .",
    "let @xmath59 be a stable configuration , and define the operator @xmath60 such that the stable configuration @xmath61 is the one achieved after addition of sand at site @xmath42 and relaxing .",
    "the mathematical treatment of the sandpile models relies on one simple property they possess @xcite : the order in which the operations of particle addition and site toppling are performed does not matter .",
    "thus the operators @xmath60 commute , _",
    "i.e. _ ,    @xmath62    to prove this we start by noting that if we have a configuration with two or more unstable sites , then these sites can be relaxed in any order , and the resulting configuration is independent of the order of toppling .",
    "consider two unstable sites @xmath42 and @xmath63 .",
    "if we topple at @xmath42 first , this can only increase the value of @xmath64 ( by condition 2 ) , and site @xmath63 remains unstable . after toppling at @xmath63",
    "also , the height at any site @xmath65 , as a result of these two topplings , undergoes a net change of @xmath66 . clearly toppling first at @xmath63",
    ", then at @xmath42 gives the same result . by a repeated use of this property",
    ", any number of unstable sites in a configuration can be relaxed in any order , always giving the same result .",
    "also , the operation of toppling at an _ unstable _ site @xmath42 , commutes with that of adding a particle at some site @xmath63 , for if the site @xmath42 is unstable and topples , it will do so also if the addition at site @xmath63 was performed first . by a repeated use of the property that the individual operations of addition and toppling commute with each other",
    ", the abelian property of @xmath67 follows .",
    "while this property seems very general , it should be noted that it is not shared by most of the other models of soc like the forest - fire model @xcite , or even other sandpile models , such as the critical slope model where the toppling condition at site @xmath42 depends on the height at other sites , or the zhang model @xcite in which the amount of sand transferred depends on the amount by which the local height exceeds the critical value .      the operators @xmath67 satisfy additional relations .",
    "for example , on the square lattice , if one adds 4 particles at a given site , the site is bound to topple once , and a particle is added to each of its nearest neighbors .",
    "thus ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 are the nearest neighbors of @xmath63 [ fig . 5 ] .",
    "in the general case one has instead of ( [ gen4 ] ) , @xmath70    using the abelian property , in any product of operators @xmath67 , we can collect together occurences of the same operator , and using the reduction rules ( [ gen ] ) , we can reduce the power of @xmath60 to be always less than @xmath71 . the @xmath67 are therefore the generators of a finite abelian semi - group ( the associative property follows from the definition ) , subject to the relations ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "these relations define the semi - group completely .",
    "let us consider the repeated action of some generator @xmath72 on some configuration @xmath59 .",
    "since the number of possible states is finite , the orbit of @xmath72 must at some stage close on itself , so that @xmath73 for some positive period @xmath74 , and non - negative integer @xmath75 .",
    "the first configuration that occurs twice in the orbit of @xmath72 is not necessarily @xmath76 , so that the orbit consists of a sequence of transient configurations followed be a cycle ( see fig .",
    "if this orbit does not exhaust all configurations , we can take a configuration outside this orbit , and repeat the process .",
    "thus the space of configurations is broken up into disconnected parts , each containing one limit cycle .",
    "[ cycle ]    under the action of @xmath72 the transient configurations are unattainable once the system has reached one of the periodic configurations . in principle these states might still be reachable as a result of the action of some other operator , e.g. @xmath77 .",
    "however , the abelian property implies that if @xmath76 is a configuration which is part of one of the limit cycles of @xmath72 , then so is @xmath78 , since @xmath79 implies that @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the transient configurations with respect to @xmath72 are also transient with respect to other operators @xmath81 , and hence occur with zero probability in the steady state of the system .",
    "the abelian property thus implies that @xmath77 maps cycles of @xmath72 to cycles of @xmath72 , and moreover , that all these cycles have the same period .",
    "we can now repeat our previous argument , to show that the action of @xmath77 on a cycle is finally closed on itself to yield a torus , possibly with some transient configuration , which may be also discarded . repeating this argument for the other generators leads to the conclusion that the set of all recurrent configurations forms a multi - dimensional torus under the action of the @xmath82 s .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the set @xmath83 of recurrent states , we can define inverse operators @xmath84 , for all @xmath42 as each configuration in a cycle has exactly one incoming arrow corresponding to operator @xmath60 .",
    "thus the @xmath82 operators generate a group .",
    "the action of the @xmath82 s on the states corresponds to translations on the torus . from the symmetry of the torus under translations ,",
    "it is clear that all recurrent states appear in the stationary state with equal probability .",
    "this analysis , which is valid for every finite abelian group , leaves open the possibility that some configurations are not reachable from each other , in which case there might be several different mutually disconnected tori .",
    "however , such a situation can not happen in the asm if we allow addition of sand at all sites with nonzero probabilities ( all @xmath85 ) . then , the configuration @xmath86 , in which all the sites have their maximal height is reachable from every configuration , and is therefore recurrent , and since inverses of @xmath82 s exist for configurations in @xmath83 , every recurrent configuration is reachable from @xmath86 , implying that all recurrent states lie on the same torus .",
    "if some of the addition probabilities @xmath43 are zero , one has to consider the subgroup formed taking various powers of those @xmath87 s which have nonzero @xmath88 .",
    "this may still generate the full group .",
    "( on a square lattice of size @xmath89 , the number of independent generators of the group can be shown to be only @xmath25 @xcite , and hence if one selects @xmath90 generators at random , with a large probability one generates the full group . )",
    "if not , the dynamics splits @xmath91 to several disconnected tori , and the steady state is non - unique . it does not fully forget the initial condition , as the evolution is confined to the torus on which we started .",
    "we consider a vector space @xmath92 whose basis vectors are the different configurations of @xmath83 .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath93 will be given by a vector @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the probability that the system is in configuration @xmath76 at time @xmath93 .",
    "the operators @xmath96 can be defined to act on the vector space @xmath97 through their operation on the basis vectors .",
    "the time evolution is markovian , and governed by the equation @xmath98 where @xmath99    to solve the time evolution in general , we have to diagonalize the evolution operator @xmath100 .",
    "being mutually commuting , the @xmath60 may be simultaneously diagonalized , and this also diagonalizes @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 be the simultaneous eigenvector of @xmath67 , with eigenvalues @xmath102 , for @xmath103 .",
    "then @xmath104 since the @xmath82 operators now form a group , the relations ( [ gen ] ) may be written as    @xmath105    applying the lhs to the eigenvector @xmath101 gives @xmath106 , for every @xmath65 , so that @xmath107 , or inverting ,    @xmath108_{jk}m_k\\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath109 is the inverse of @xmath46 , and the @xmath110 s are arbitrary integers .",
    "the particular eigenstate @xmath111 ( @xmath112 for all @xmath63 ) is invariant under the action of all the @xmath82 s , @xmath113 .",
    "thus @xmath111 must be the stationary state of the system since    @xmath114    we can now see explicitly that the steady state is independent of the values of the @xmath43 s and that _ in the steady state , all recurrent configurations occur with equal probability._. as discussed above , when some of the @xmath43 s are zero , the stationary state may not be unique . in this case",
    ", the general steady state is a linear combination of two or more eigenvectors of @xmath100 having eigenvalue @xmath115 and then the dynamics is no longer ergodic .",
    "an important quantity characterizing the steady state is its response to a small perturbation . here",
    "it can be measured by the probability that a single particle added at some site causes a perturbation which affects a site at a distance @xmath3 from it .",
    "let @xmath116 be the expected number of toppling at site @xmath63 , upon adding a particle at site @xmath42 _ in the steady state_. since in the steady state the expectation value of the number of particles at a site is constant , there must exist a balance between the average influx of particles from toppling at other sites , and the outflux from toppling at the site . for the square lattice model ,",
    "this relation gives [ fig .",
    "5 ]    @xmath117    where @xmath118 . in the general case",
    "we have    @xmath119    where the @xmath120 takes account of the addition of one particle at @xmath42 .",
    "solving for @xmath121 gives simply    @xmath122_{ik}\\ .\\ ] ]    note that this derivation does not use the abelian property , only the fact that the mass transferred in each toppling is the same .",
    "it is therefore valid for a much wider class of models .",
    "such an equation still holds if the toppling condition is a critical slope condition , but not if the number of particles transferred depends on the slope .    in the case of a @xmath123-dimensional hypercubic lattice , with particle trasfer to nearest neighbors , and loss of sand only at the boundary , this is just the inverse of the lattice laplacian .",
    "then it is easy to see that    @xmath124    where @xmath25 is the size of the lattice .",
    "we note that the influence function g does show the promised long - ranged correlations .",
    "given a stable configuration of the pile , how can we tell if it is recurrent or transient ?",
    "a first observation is that there are some forbidden subconfigurations which may never be created , if not already present in the initial state by addition of sand and relaxation .",
    "the simplest example on the square lattice case is a subconfiguration of two adjacent sites of height 1 ,  . since @xmath125 , a site of height 1",
    "may only be created as a result of a toppling at one of the two sites ( toppling anywhere else can only add particles to this pair of sites ) . but a toppling of either of these sites results in a height of at least 2 at the other .",
    "thus , any configuration which contains two adjacent 1 s is transient .",
    "the argument may now be repeated to prove that subconfigurations such as @xmath126 also can never appear in a recurrent configuration .    in general ,",
    "a forbidden subconfiguration ( fsc ) is a set of connected sites @xmath127 such that the height @xmath64 of each site @xmath63 in @xmath127 , is less than or equal to the number of neighbors of @xmath63 in @xmath127 .",
    "the proof of this assertion is by induction on the number of sites in @xmath127 .",
    "for example , creation of the configuration , must involve toppling at one of the end sites , but then the configuration must have had a before the toppling .",
    "but this was shown before to be forbidden , etc .      a more systematic way to test for recurrence of a given configuration",
    "is by using the relations  ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "let us take up again the example of square lattice .",
    "multiplying all the relations gives @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the number of neighbors of a given site , _ i.e. _ , 4 for a bulk site , 3 or 2 for a boundary site .",
    "now we use the property that inverses are defined on the set @xmath83 of recurrent states , which allows cancellation , yielding @xmath130    in other words , in order to check whether a given configuration @xmath59 is recurrent , one has to add a particle at each boundary site ( 2 at corners ) , relax the system , and check whether the final configuration is same as @xmath59 . if it is , @xmath59 is recurrent , otherwise it is not @xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence of the existence of forbidden configurations is the following : consider an asm on an undirected graph with @xmath131 sites and @xmath132 bonds between sites . then in any recurrent configuration the number of sandgrains is greater than or equal to @xmath133 . note that here we do not count the boundary bonds that correspond to particles leaving the system . to prove this , we just observe that if the inequality is not true for any configuration , it must have an fsc in it ( proof by induction on @xmath131 ) .",
    "as explained above , a recurrent configuration is characterized by being invariant under addition of particles at the boundary in a judicious fashion , and relaxing .",
    "when the matrix @xmath46 is symmetric , this test is equivalent to a simpler test , called the burning test , which is defined as follows @xcite . given a configuration , at first all the sites are considered unburnt .",
    "then , burn each site whose height is larger than the number of its unburnt neighbors .",
    "this process is repeated recursively , until no further sites can be burnt .",
    "then , if all the sites have been burnt , the original configuration was recurrent , whereas if some unburnt sites were left , then the original configuration was transient , and the remaining sites form an fsc .",
    "as an example , let us take a configuration on a four by four square lattice shown below .",
    "its evolution under burning is as shown : @xmath134 where burned sites are denoted by empty squares . at first",
    "the ` fire ' burns some of the boundary sites , and it then advances inward .",
    "no site in the last configuration can be burned , and the set of unburnt sites is thus a forbidden subconfiguration .",
    "if the height of the third site on the second row were changed from 2 to  3 , then it could be burned next , and the fire would have spread completely , and such a configuration would be recurrent .",
    "it is obvious that the burning process is in fact identical to toppling , starting from addition at the boundary , except that it is simpler to use , as we work with initial height configuration , and do not need to keep updating them with each toppling [ since we know that the final configuration is the same as the starting one , if all sites topple exactly once ] .    to see what could go wrong",
    "when @xmath46 is asymmetric consider the example of a two site sandpile with a toppling matrix @xmath135 . in the unsymmetrical case ,",
    "a site is burnt if its height exceeds the number of outgoing bonds to unburnt neighbors .",
    "a configuration with five grains at 1 , and one grain at 2 would pass the burning test , but is in fact transient .",
    "a site like site 2 , which has more incoming arrows than outgoing arrows is called a greedy site . in this case , equations satisfied by the operators @xmath72 and @xmath77 are @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "this gives the identity operator as @xmath138 , but adding three particles on site @xmath115 in a recurrent configuration , we get one toppling at site @xmath115 , but two topplings at site @xmath139 . clearly , the burning test fails as it assumes that under multiplication by the identity operator [ eq.(11 ) ] , each site topples only once .",
    "we also see that if there are no greedy sites , the burning test is a necessary and sufficient test for recurrence even for unsymmetrical graphs .",
    "what is the total number of recurrent configurations ?",
    "if we were to take care of only the constraint that is disallowed , this problem is a special case of the nearest - neighbor exclusion lattice gas model , which is equivalent to the famous unsolved problem of the ising model in a magnetic field .",
    "however , it turns out the infinity of the fsc constraints actually can be taken care of , and the final result is rather simple : the total number of recurrent configurations @xmath140 is given by @xmath141    consider the set of all possible configurations @xmath142 .",
    "we can define an equivalence relation on this set of configurations as follows : we call two configurations @xmath76 and @xmath143 as equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a series of topplings and untopplings [ untoppling is the reverse of toppling , in an ` untoppling ' at site @xmath42 , the height at all sites @xmath63 is _ increased _ by an amount @xmath144 . for this purpose",
    ", we can topple or untopple at any site whatever be its local height at that time .",
    "this is equivalent to defining @xmath145 if and only if @xmath146 for some integers @xmath147 .",
    "the members of an equivalence class form a superlattice of @xmath148 , with the rows of @xmath46 as basis vectors [ fig .",
    "it is easily shown that each equivalence class contains exactly one recurrent configuration .",
    "firstly , starting with any configuration , if we untopple once at all sites , we get an equivalent configuration with an increased number of sandgrains in the system .",
    "we then relax the resulting configuration .",
    "as this process , equivalent to adding particles and relaxing , can be repeated , the stable configuration thus reached is recurrent . thus , each equivalence class has at least one recurrent configuration .",

    "( 23 ) over all @xmath42 , and @xmath127 be the set of sites for which this maximum value is reached .",
    "then , to go from @xmath150 to @xmath149 , each site in @xmath127 topples at least one more time than its neighbors outside @xmath127 . hence each site in @xmath127",

    "furthermore the integers @xmath159 , can be chosen such that @xmath160 is an integer multiple of @xmath161 , and under this condition , the decomposition is unique .",
    "for example , @xmath162 but @xmath163 .    to construct this factorization for the abelian group @xmath121 for the asm , we use the following classical results , known as the smith decomposition @xcite : given an integer @xmath164 matrix @xmath46 , there exist unimodular integer @xmath164 matrices @xmath8 and @xmath165 , and an integer diagonal matrix @xmath166 such that @xmath167 [ a matrix is said to be unimodular if its determinant is @xmath168 .",

    "the matrices @xmath8 and @xmath165 are not unique .    the smith decomposition is constructed step by step as follows : we define two matrices @xmath46 and @xmath170 to be similar [ to be denoted by @xmath171 if there exist unimodular matrices @xmath172 and @xmath173 such that @xmath174 . among the unimodular matrices",

    "explicitly , @xmath175 is just the identity with rows @xmath42 and @xmath63 interchanged , and @xmath176 is the identity with an additional @xmath75 in the @xmath177-th position .",
    "let @xmath178 be one of the non - zero elements of @xmath46 having the smallest absolute value .",
    "operating with interchange matrices , we can get an equivalent matrix @xmath170 in which this element occurs in the lower right corner . then ,",
    "by multiplication with the matrices of type @xmath179 , the members of the last row and last column are replaced by their remainders modulo @xmath180 .",
    "if any of the remainders are non - zero , the smallest one may be shifted to the corner , and the process repeated until the last row and column are zero except for the corner element : @xmath181    then , if any of the still nonzero elements of the resulting matrix is not divisible by the element @xmath182 in the lower right corner , its row may be added to the last row , and as before the remainder is brought to the corner .",
    "thus , @xmath182 can be chosen to be the greatest common divisor of all the elements of the original matrix @xmath46 .    applying the same process reduces @xmath183 to matrix @xmath184 which has additionally row and column @xmath185 empty except for the @xmath186-th element which is the gcd of the elements of @xmath183 except @xmath182 .",
    "this procedure finally yields the matrix @xmath166 and the products of @xmath187 and @xmath179 matrices used give the matrices @xmath8 and @xmath165 .",

    "in this section , we shall use the burning test to relate the asm to the classical spanning tree problem .",
    "this then allows one to relate the asm problem to other well - studied problems in lattice statistics and graph theory : the resistor networks , the potts model , and the loop - erased random walk .",
    "spanning trees are graph theoretical objects , defined as follows : consider a symmetric graph , where multiple links are allowed , but not self links .",

    "the well - known matrix - tree theorem in graph theory @xcite states that the number of different spanning trees one can construct on the graph is equal to the determinant of a matrix obtained by deleting an arbitrary column and an arbitrary row from @xmath215 .      in order to relate the undirected asm to the spanning trees problem",
    ", we consider the graph obtained by adding a sink site to the ( undirected ) graph specifying the asm , and connect the sink site to all the boundary sites ( called dissipative sites previously ) by as many bonds as the number of sandgrains dissipated at that site .",
    "we now take any recurrent configuration of the asm , and consider the propagation of ` fire ' in the burning test for this configuration .",
    "the fire starts at the sink site from which spreads to boundary sites , and then onto other sites .",
    "since each site is visited at most once , propagation of fire in the burning process describes a tree , and for a recurrent configuration a spanning tree .",
    "we now show that one can uniquely determine the initial height configuration if one knows the spanning tree formed by the fire .",
    "this would establish a one - to - one correpondence between the recurrent configurations of the asm and the spanning trees on the the corresponding graph ( with sink site added ) .    in the formulation of the burning test ,",
    "the order in which various sites are burnt is immaterial . to establish the equivalence",
    ", we make a particular choice : the sites are burnt in discrete ` time ' steps . at time - step @xmath218",
    ", only the sink site is assumed to be burnt , and all other sites are unburnt . for all @xmath219 , at time @xmath220 , we burn all sites which are burnable at time @xmath93 ( i.e. sites whose height exceeds the number of unburnt neighbors ) . thus at time @xmath115 , only some of boundary sites are burnt . at the next time - step",
    ", the fire will spread to some of their neighbors , and so on .",
    "if a site catches fire at time @xmath93 , it is said to have a burning time @xmath93 . clearly ,",

    "we form the spanning tree corresponding to this recurrent configuration by connecting each site to its neighbor with burning time one less than its own .",
    "it is easy to see that in this way , knowing the tree , we can determine the the height at each site .",
    "for example , on a square lattice , an edge site ( not a corner site ) has a burning time @xmath115 if and only if its height is @xmath222 .",
    "if a site @xmath42 with burning time @xmath223 has @xmath224 neighbors with lesser burning time , its height must be @xmath225 [ because it did not catch fire until @xmath224-th neighbor was burnt ] .",
    "there can be some ambiguity , if two or more neighbors of @xmath42 have burning time exactly @xmath226 . to remedy this",
    ", we adopt some arbitrary precedence rule to decide the burning path depending on the height at that site .",
    "if there are @xmath30 neighbors of the site with burning time exactly @xmath227 , there are exactly @xmath30 possible values of @xmath18 consistent with the burning history , hence such a rule can always be set up .",
    "for example , we may choose the rule that if the height at the site could be @xmath228 or @xmath222 consistent with the burning rules , then height @xmath228 would assign the burning path to the neighbor coming first according to the precedence rule @xmath229 , and if height is @xmath222 to the other .",
    "in this way , we can set up a one - to - one correspondence between recurrent configurations of the asm and all possible spanning trees on the corresponding graph ( with sink site added ) .    if one constructs the matrix @xmath215 associated with the graph of the asm , deleting the row and column of the sink site , one recovers the toppling matrix @xmath46 . by the matrix tree theorem ,",
    "the number of spanning trees on the graph is @xmath230 , and by the one - to - one correspondence , this is also the number of recurrent configurations , as we have already seen .",

    "[ the argument is quite straight - forward : it is easy to see that in this markov process , the transition rate for tree @xmath273 is same as the rate for @xmath274 .",

    "] we thus have a simple way to generate a uniform distribution of spanning trees on any graph by using simple random walks . note",
    "that using the one - to - one correspondence between the recurrent configurations of the asm and spanning trees , a time - series of recurrent configurations of asm obtained by random grain addition and relaxation also gives a ( different ) time series of spanning trees with uniform distribution .",
    "a loop - erased random walk is defined as the path of a random walker in which any loop is erased as soon as it is formed .",
    "clearly a loop - erased walk has no self - intersections .",
    "as such , the loop - erased walk problem is a more mathematically tractable variation of the better - known self - avoiding walk problem .",
    "it is easy to see that in a spanning tree formed by last exit bonds , the unique path along the tree from the origin to end point of the walk is the same as the loop - erased random walk at that time .",
    "as loop - erased random walks are the same as of chemical paths on spanning trees , their geometrical properties are the same . in particular , the fractal dimension of loop - erased random walks is @xmath269 @xcite .",
    "one can use this equivalence to relate other properties of loop - erased random walks to those of spanning trees , hence also to asm s @xcite .",
    "for example , the probability that the next step of the random walker will result in an erasure of a loop with area @xmath30 in the sandpile language is related to the probability that the the last wave will have exactly @xmath30 topplings .",
    "the probability of forming a loop of area @xmath115 in two dimensions is also related to the concentration @xmath275 of sites of height @xmath115 .",

    "interested reader should consult @xcite for further discussion .",
    "the abelian group structure of the original btw model still does not allow us to deal effectively with the avalanches in the model .",
    "the reason is that the avalanche statistics is very ` coordinate - dependent ' . for an abelian group generated by two operators @xmath278 ,",
    "an equally good choice of generators is @xmath279 .",
    "but this set will clearly have a different avalanche statistics !",
    "i describe below a variant of the btw model , the directed asm .",
    "the model was defined to take into account the fact that under gravity , particles would only fall ` down ' , and not ` up ' @xcite ; and the existence of preferred direction usually changes the universality class of critical behavior .",
    "it has the added advantage that it is mathematically simpler , and allows explicit calculation of various quantities .",
    "the model is defined on a square lattice oriented in the @xmath280 direction , so that bonds are at @xmath281 to the edge .",
    "sand grains are added anywhere on the top edge with equal probability . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction ( see fig .",
    "10 ) . on each toppling ,",
    "one grain of sand is transferred to each of the two downward neighbors .",
    "particles can leave the system from the bottom .    [",
    "directed ]    this model can be described as a ` child playing with wooden blocks on a staircase ' @xcite .",
    "sitting on the top stair , the child drops the blocks randomly , and when a block lands on another block , both blocks fall to the two adjacent sites at the next step below .",
    "this perhaps better models the dynamics of a real sandpile , where most of the sand stays inert inside the pile ( playing the role of the staircase ) , the avalanches only reorganize the surface layer , and the sand falls only downwards in topplings .",
    "the toppling matrix @xmath46 of a directed sandpile is upper triangular .",
    "thus , @xmath282 is just the product of the diagonal elements , which is equal to @xmath283 .",
    "hence all stable configurations are recurrent , and the invariant measure is just the product measure of single site distributions , each one having equal probability of having one grain or no grains .",
    "this observation permits a direct calculation of the probability of avalanche sizes .",
    "for example , the probability that upon addition of a particle to an arbitrary site at the top of the sandpile nothing happens , is just the probability that the site in question has height 0 , namely @xmath284 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath285 the probability to get a single toppling is the same as the probability of having 1 grain in the top site , and no grains in the two nearest neighbors below as in the following diagram ,  = .1 mm    ( 60,60)(30,50 ) ( 10,0)(50,0 )    . here ,",
    "the filled and open circles denote occupied and empty sites respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath286 it is straightforward to continue in this procedure . for @xmath287 avalanches",

    "however , explicit enumeration is tedius if @xmath30 is not very small .",
    "we now consider the asymptotics of avalanche size distribution for large values of @xmath30 . to this end",
    "we note that if two neighboring sites in the same level topple , then the site which is directly below both of these sites get two sand grains , and must also topple .",
    "this implies that avalanches contain no holes .",
    "therefore an avalanche is completely determined by its left and right boundaries .",
    "consider the motion of the right boundary as the avalanche progresses downwards . whether the next step is to the right or to the left ,",
    "is determined only by the height of the site immediately below and to the right .",
    "if the height in question is one , then step is to the right , and if it is zero , it is to the left .",
    "thus , the right boundary , and the similarly the left boundary , are described by simple random walks .",
    "the probability that the avalanche stops at the layer @xmath290-th layer is the same as the probability that two random walks in one dimension , which start at the same point , meet for the first time after a time @xmath290 .",
    "this is a classical problem in probability , and the probability distribution is well - known @xcite . @xmath291 for large @xmath290 this varies as @xmath292 .    as an object delimited by random walks ,",
    "the typical width of an avalanche of duration @xmath290 scales like @xmath293 , and the typical number of toppled sites scales like @xmath294 .",
    "therefore , @xmath295 finally the probability of getting avalanche of size @xmath30 scales like the derivative of the previous expression , namely as @xmath296 .",
    "the directed asm can be solved exactly in higher dimension as well . for @xmath297 ,",
    "the boundaries of clusters are not lines , but surfaces .",
    "also , the clusters can have holes .",
    "so , we can not use the simple random walk arguments to determine the exponents .",
    "the tools needed to analyze avalanche statistics in this general case are the two- and three - point green s functions .",
    "the simplifying feature of the directed asm s is that these functions satisfy linear equations .",
    "the two point green s function @xmath298 has already been discussed before : it is the probability of a topple at the site @xmath299 given an addition of grain of sand at @xmath300 . here",
    "we denote by ` time ' the coordinate along the down direction , and @xmath301 is a @xmath302-dimensional vector giving the position of a site on the constant-@xmath93 surface .    in the invariant state",
    "it is equally likely to have any number between @xmath238 and @xmath303 grains of sand at a given site , and therefore the probability that it topples given that @xmath224 of its upward neighbors have toppled is @xmath304 .",
    "this yields the relation @xmath305 which is a discrete diffusion equation for @xmath306 .",
    "its solution behaves for large @xmath93 as @xmath307 the flux of particles through a surface of equal @xmath93 scales like @xmath308 as expected @xmath309    let us assume that the probability to have an avalanche of ` duration ' greater than @xmath93 scales asymptotically as @xmath310 .",
    "the flux relation implies that an avalanche that reaches @xmath93 has typically @xmath311 topplings there , and therefore the total mass of the avalanche @xmath30 varies as @xmath312 .",
    "it follows that the probability of having an avalanche of size greater than @xmath30 scales like @xmath313 .    to find @xmath314 we need another independent measure , for example @xmath315 the expectation of the square flux is expressible in term of the @xmath228-point function @xmath316 , which is the probability of that both @xmath299 and @xmath317 topple given that one particle was added at @xmath300 .",

    "then shows that @xmath339 in dimension @xmath332 . in @xmath335 , we get @xmath340 .",
    "this implies that the probability that avalanche stops at the @xmath290-th layer varies as @xmath341 .",
    "these logarithmic corrections have been verified in simulations @xcite .",
    "we have already seen that in two dimensions , @xmath342 .",
    "the upper critical dimension is three .",
    "in the previous section , we studied the dasm as an example of a self - organized system in which the invariant state is easily charcterized .",
    "another motivation for studying this model is that it equivalent to other statistical models which were proposed in other contexts . here",
    "i will discuss three such models .",
    "the first is the scheidegger s model of river basins @xcite .",
    "scheidegger , a hydrologist , originally proposed this model as a very simplified description of how rainfall accumulates into small streams which then coalesce to become larger and larger river .",
    "we consider a large area with roughly uniform average rainfall , and having a constant average slope ( say southward ) .",
    "we represent the area approximately as a square grid , tilted and oriented as in the dasm . at any point of the lattice",
    ", there may be zero , one or two streams of water bringing water from its two upstream neighbors .",
    "if @xmath75 units of water come into a site per unit time ( usually taken to be a year in geophysics ) , @xmath343 units of water leave the site in a single stream towards one of the two sites just below it ( the extra one unit comes from the local rainfall ) .",
    "whether it goes to the south - east or south - west neighbor depends on local geographical details . in this model , these directions are chosen randomly at each site .",
    "if we draw the directions of water - flow going out of each site , we get a picture of the river network of the area .",
    "such networks are also called drainage networks .",
    ". 11 ] . in a drainage network",
    ", there is a unique path from each site to the ` sea ' ( the lower boundary in fig .",
    "also , there are no loops , if we ignore the possibility of a single stream breaking into two streams ( fairly good approximation away from delta regions ) , the drainage networks must form a directed spanning tree .    using these rules",
    "it is now possible to calculate the probability that the outflow from a site is one unit : this event happens if and only if the site receives no water from either of its two up neighbors , because the right hand side neighbor has outflow directed to the right , and the left neighbor is flowing to the left . thus @xmath344  . similarly , to get an outflow of two units , it is necessary to have inflow of one unit , so that one of neighbors from above has to have outflow of 1 directed at the given site , and the other neighbor from above has to have outflow directed to its other neighbor from below .",
    "such an event has probability @xmath345 , and since there are two ways to choose the the flow into the site , we have @xmath346 .",
    "on comparing the previous argument with the discussion of the dasm we see that the configuration of sites required to get an outflow of two units is identical to that which is associated with an avalanche of size two , starting from the given site and going _ upwards_. the two configurations which are associated with outflow of two units are the ones possible for a size two avalanche , and a similar result holds for larger values of the outflow .",
    "the only difference is that there is no possibility of outflow of zero units .",
    "therefore we have the relation @xmath347    now all the earlier discussed results regarding the dasm apply equally well to the river network model . in particular , a river of total length @xmath9 will drain typically an area of size @xmath348 .",
    "this observation is in rough agreement with observation on rivers on scales which are not very large .",
    "we can study the model in higher dimensions . in three dimensions",
    ", one can think of the capillary network for flow of blood in an animal , where each ` cell ' generates ` waste ' , which has to be transported out using the tree - like network of capillaries .",
    "drainage networks in higher dimensions are harder to visualize .    the scheidegger river network model in fact generates a directed spanning tree of the lattice .",
    "when the river network is situated in a relatively flat landscape , it should resemble more an undirected spanning tree , so a simple model for such a network would be just to assume that in a river network on a flat landscape , all spanning trees are equally likely to be realized .",
    "_ the geometrical structure of river networks thus can be modelled by that of a random spanning tree in two dimensions . _",
    "it turns out that this simple model describes the real river networks just as well as the more complicated models proposed in literature .",
    "the random spanning trees are described by the @xmath238-state potts model . using the results from the conformal field theory for potts model",
    ", we see that for random spanning trees , the typical length @xmath25 of the path along tree between two points at a euclidean distance @xmath3 scales like @xmath349 .",
    "this scaling provides an estimate of the area @xmath8 drained by a river of length @xmath25 @xmath350 that is , slightly larger than the exponent in the directed network ( where @xmath351 ) .",
    "there is a large amount of literature dealing with the modelling of river networks .",
    "if we include the phenomena of erosion , which transports matter , and thus alters the elevation across the landscape , which in turn affects the river - flow , we have a complex self - organized structure .",
    "a long excursion into models of river networks is outside the scope of these lectures .",
    "i will only provide a few pointers here @xcite .",
    "another model , which models a physically very different phenomenon , but falls into the same equivalence class is the takayasu aggregation model @xcite .",
    "it describes a system in which particles are continuously injected , diffuse , and coalesce . in its simplest example",
    ", it can be defined on a one - dimensional chain .",
    "the explicit rules of evolution are :    1 .   at each time step , each particle in the system moves by a single step , to the left or to the right , taken with equal probability , independent of the choice at other sites .",
    "a single particle is added at every site .",
    "if there are more than one particles at one any site , they coalesce and become a single particle whose mass is the sum of the masses of the coalescing parts . in all subsequent evolution , the composite particle acts as a single particle .",
    "a quantity of interest in this system is the probability distribution of the total mass at a randomly chosen site at late times .",
    "since mass is added all the time and can not escape , the average mass per site is proportional to @xmath93 . as discussed earlier , a diverging first moment of a distribution could come from a power law tail , with a cutoff which increases as a power of the time @xmath93 .",
    "such a tail indeed exists in the mass distribution .",
    "it is not hard to see that this model in one dimension is very similar to the ( two - dimensional ) river network model .",
    "we consider a space - time history of the evolution .",
    "the world - lines of a diffusing particles look like the rivers of fig 9 .",
    "the probability to have a particle a mass @xmath215 is therefore equal to the probability to have outflow @xmath215 , which is twice the probability of finding an avalanche of size @xmath215 in the respective dasm .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath93 , the mass probability distribution is characterized by the same exponent    @xmath352    where @xmath353 varies as @xmath354 , and @xmath355 is some cutoff function .",
    "this model is also easily generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "the river network and aggregation models differ from the sandpile models in that the driving is finite and deterministic and the evolution is random .",
    "they thus provide examples of systems which display soc without the requirement of infinitesimal driving .",
    "sometimes , it is argued that infinitesimal driving should be considered as a defining characteristics of soc @xcite . if this is done , takayasu aggregation model , while mathematically equivqlent to the sandpile model , which is the prototypical model of soc , would not show soc !      the voter model is defined as follows : we consider a @xmath123-dimensional lattice . at each site",
    ", there is an individual ( voter ) who has an opinion on an issue .",
    "we take this opinion to be a two - valued discrete variable ( yes or no ) . a voter can communicate with his neighbors , and can change his opinion in time .",
    "we take time - evolution to be discrete time markovian : if at time @xmath93 , a site has @xmath224 neighbors who vote yes , at time @xmath220 , this site would choose to vote ` yes ' with probability @xmath356 , and ` no ' with probability @xmath357 .",
    "given the particular choice of local transition rates , one can try to write down evolution equations for ensemble averaged quantities , for example @xmath358 , where @xmath359 specifies state of the voter at site @xmath6 at time @xmath93 , taking value @xmath115 if ` yes ' , and @xmath238 if ` no ' .",
    "normally , such evolution equations involve higher - spin correlation functions .",
    "this gives the well - known bbgky hierarchy of equations for correlation functions .",
    "it is easy to see that for the voter model , this hierarchy closes on itself .",
    "the equation for evolution of @xmath358 involves only the @xmath360 at neighboring sites @xmath361 , and no higher order correlation functions .",
    "specifically , in two dimensions @xmath362 where the sum over @xmath361 is over the nearest neighbors of @xmath6 .",
    "these are linear equations , easily solved by eigenmode decomposition .",
    "one can similarly show that equations satisfied by the 2-point correlation functions also close on themselves , and so on .",
    "this model has been studied a lot , and a fair amount of literature exists about it @xcite .    to note the connection with the directed asm ,",
    "consider evolution of a @xmath123-dimensional voter model which at time @xmath218 has only one voter having a ` yes ' vote in a sea of  no s .",
    "then in the space - time history of the evolution , there is a single cluster of ` yes ' sites .",
    "it is easy to see that the probability that this cluster will have a given shape is exactly the same as that of the same avalanche cluster in the dasm in @xmath363 dimensions .",
    "the simplest undirected model is defined on a one dimensional chain of length @xmath25 .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 is tridiagonal @xmath364 and its determinant is easily seen to be @xmath365    it is thus a degenerate case where the number of recurrent configurations grows only polynomially and not exponentially with @xmath25 .",
    "it is not hard to identify the @xmath366 recurrent configurations .",
    "they are either a configuration with all ones , or a configuration with a single zero somewhere along the chain .",
    "[ chains ]    the result of an addition of a grain of sand at point @xmath11 to a configuration with a zero at @xmath6 is as follows : let us consider first the case @xmath367 .",
    "the site @xmath11 is toppled , then its nearest neighbors , and so on , creating a wave which stops on one side at @xmath6 and at the other side at @xmath25 .",
    "the result of this wave of toppling is a configuration with two grains of sand at @xmath11 , zero at @xmath368 and at @xmath25 , and one grain everywhere else . now a second wave of toppling begins at @xmath11 at the end of which the zeros move to @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "this process continues until one of the zeros reaches @xmath11 and then it stops .",
    "the total number of topplings @xmath30 in such an avalanche is @xmath371 .",
    "the case @xmath372 is similar .",
    "we then obtain the avalanche distribution using the fact @xmath6 and @xmath11 are uniformly distributed .",
    "@xmath373 details may be found in the paper by ruelle and sen @xcite .",
    "it may be of interest to note that for finite @xmath25 , the function @xmath374 is not a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath30 , and shows gaps ( depending on @xmath25 ) where @xmath289 is exactly zero . for large @xmath25 , @xmath6 and @xmath11",
    "are of order @xmath25 , and hence @xmath375 .",
    "another way to express this is by a direct calculation of the probability distribution of @xmath30 which takes the scaling form    @xmath376    where @xmath355 is a scaling function whose explicit form is known @xcite .",
    "the gaps in the function @xmath377 are filled by the smearing , and the scaling function @xmath355 is well behaved .",
    "this distribution function has the undesirable feature that in the thermodynaimc limit @xmath378 the probability of observing any finite avalanche goes to zero .",
    "this behavior is atypical even for one - dimensional models .",
    "for example , on a ladder , or a necklace ( a decorated chain ) [ fig . 12 ] , we can determine the behavior of successive waves of toppling , and hence the distribution of avalanches @xcite .",
    "unlike the linear chain , on a ladder or necklace , the number of recurrent configurations grows exponentially with @xmath25 .",
    "the avalanches are of two types : type i consist of a single wave which stops after toppling a finite fraction of sites , and type ii which consist of many waves of topplings and is similar to the avalanches in a single chain [ see fig . 13 ] .",
    "both these types occure with @xmath379 probability , so that the event size probablity distribution takes the asymptotic form    @xmath380    this linear combination of simple scaling forms is a very simple example of multifractal behavior , with just two exponents .",
    "it demonstartes how simple finite - size scaling may be violated .",
    "apart from the linear chain and ladders , the only explicitly solvable realization of the undirected sandpile model is when it is defined on a tree , such as the bethe lattice .",
    "as expected , the model displays a mean field behavior on this effectively infinite - dimensional lattice .",
    "i only indicate the general technique of solution . for details ,",
    "the reader has to consult the original paper @xcite .",
    "consider the asm on a cayley tree .",
    "one starts by characterizing the recurrent configurations .",
    "consider the subconfiguration on a subtree of @xmath224 generations .",

    "these limits are used to determine the relative probabilities of various subconfigurations deep inside the tree in the steady state .",
    "for example , we find that for a 3-coordinated lattice , the sites with heights @xmath386 and @xmath228 occur with relative frequencies @xmath387 .",
    "the propagation of avalanches is simple in this lattice . on adding a particle , all sites belonging to the cluster of sites having height @xmath228 containing the point of addition topple , and no other .",

    "it is then straight forward to write down explicit expressions for @xmath289 for @xmath388 .    unlike the one - dimensional chain , here",
    "the probability to get a finite event remains finite in the thermodynamic limit , the and the probability distribution of the number of toppling @xmath30 behaves asymptotically as @xmath389 .",

    "the simplest to calculate is @xcite    @xmath396    consider an auxialiary asm defined on a graph with site @xmath42 and its connecting links removed . in the burning algorithm , a site with @xmath397 can be burned only after all of its neighbors have been burnt .",
    "let @xmath76 be a recurrent configuration of the sandpile with @xmath397 .",
    "we define @xmath143 to be a sandpile configuration of the auxiliary asm obtained from @xmath76 by deleting the site @xmath42 , and decreasing the height at each neighbor of @xmath42 by @xmath115 .",
    "it is easy to see that burning proceeds identically in @xmath76 and @xmath143 .",
    "thus there is one - to- one correspondence between recurrent configuration of the original asm with @xmath397 , and all recurrent configurations of the auxiliary asm .",
    "but the latter is easily calculated by the determinant of its toppling matrix , say @xmath170 .",
    "we augment the toppling matrix @xmath170 by adding a diagonal entry @xmath115 for the site @xmath42 .",
    "the only rows and columns in which @xmath170 is different from @xmath46 are those associated with @xmath42 and its four neighbors .",
    "thus we can write @xmath398 where @xmath399 has non - zero entries only in a @xmath400 sub - matrix",
    ". then @xmath401 which boils down to the calculation of a @xmath400 determinant .",
    "the outcome of this calculation @xcite in the limit @xmath378 is @xmath402    one can also calculate the probability that in the steady state , a randomly chosen site has height @xmath403 or @xmath222 .",
    "these require a more sophisticated use of graph - theoretical techniques . as this calculation",
    "is somewhat involved @xcite , ( even writing down the the exact analytical expressions for the final result would take up nearly a page ) we only quote the numerical values of the final result here : the concentration sites of heights @xmath404 and @xmath222 in the steady state are approximately @xmath405 and @xmath406 respectively .    similarly it is possible to calculate as a ratio of determinants the joint probability that two sites @xmath42 and @xmath63 both have height @xmath115 .",
    "the calculation now involves calculating the determinant of a @xmath407 matrix .",
    "if the distance @xmath408 between the sites is large , the leading r - dependence is found to be of the form    @xmath409    [ more generally , in @xmath123-dimensions , the correlations in heights decay as @xmath410 with the seperation @xmath224 . ]",
    "the coefficient @xmath8 , which may be calculated explicitly , is negative .",
    "thus , the height variables show some anticorrelation .",
    "we recall that having two adjacent sites with height @xmath115 is forbidden in the steady state .    from the clustering property of correlation functions ,",
    "one expects that the general expression for the height - height correlation function , consistent with the above form , will be of the form @xmath411 summing this probability over @xmath412 ranging from @xmath115 to @xmath222 , we must get @xmath413 , the concentration of sites with height @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that we must have @xmath414 , in addition to the trivial constraint @xmath415 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath416 seems to be rather complicated , and has been accomplished so far only when site @xmath42 and @xmath63 are the boundary sites @xcite .",
    "one can also study how the height probabilities are modified near an open boundary .",
    "it is found that mean height is lesser than the bulk value at a distance @xmath15 from the boundary , by an amount which varies as @xmath417 @xcite .",
    "we now come to the still unresolved question of exponents of avalanches in the 2-d model .",
    "the avalanche exponents , which are expected to be universal in two dimensions , are still unknown .",
    "the values of numerical estimates made by different people have shown a wide range of values @xcite , with different methods of analysis giving different values .",
    "avalanche sizes may be measured in terms of different quantities , such as the total number of topplings @xmath30 , the number of distinct sites toppled @xmath418 , the radius @xmath3 of the affected area , the ` duration ' @xmath290 of the avalanche , and @xmath419 , the number of waves in the avalanche .",
    "let us start with the simple finite - size scaling picture ( this may have to modified later ) . in this picture , these measures are sharply peaked functions of each other , and given the diameter of avalanche @xmath3 , other measures scale as simple powers of @xmath3 . in this case , we would expect that @xmath420 where @xmath25 is the size of system .    from the compactness of avalanche clusters",
    ", it follows that @xmath418 scales like @xmath421 . from the potts model equivalence",
    ", we see that the time @xmath290 needed to reach a site of distance @xmath3 from the origin of the avalanche scales as the chemical length of the path , so that @xmath422 . if @xmath423 and @xmath424 are the exponents characterizing the distributions for @xmath425 and @xmath290 , this implies that    @xmath426    let us assume that @xmath419 scales as a power of @xmath224 , say as @xmath427 .",
    "then , @xmath30 varies as @xmath428 , and hence as @xmath429 . to determine the avalanche exponents , we use two relations : @xmath430 , and @xmath431 .",
    "these immediately give us @xmath432 thus all the exponents are determined up to the single parameter @xmath11 .",
    "priezzhev et al using some identification of known scaling dimensions of the 2-dimensional potts model , have conjectured @xcite that @xmath433 which leads to @xmath434 and @xmath435 ( where @xmath436 is the power law decay of the @xmath30 distribution ) , which is consistent with the numerical results .",
    "the simple scaling assumption has been challenged recently by de menech et al @xcite .",
    "these authors , based on their analysis of simulations data , have argued that avalanches that reach the boundary have a qualitatively different behavior than those that do not dissipate particles .",
    "they argue that the fractional number of avalaches whose radius exceeds @xmath224 decreases as @xmath437 , for @xmath438 .",
    "the avalanches that do not reach boundary have @xmath439 and @xmath440 . for a lattice of size @xmath25 , only a fraction @xmath441 of the avalanches reach the boundary , but those that do , typically have @xmath442 more waves , so that the average size of avalanches that reach boundary is @xmath443 . thus , according to these authors @xmath444 for dissipative avalanches , but @xmath445 for the non - dissipative ones .",
    "this behavior is more in line with the linear combination of scaling forms discussed earlier [ eq.([lc2ssf ] ) ] .",
    "if the simple scaling approach breaks down due to the relatively rare large events dominating the mean values of @xmath30 and @xmath419 , we can not use the exactly known @xmath25-dependence of @xmath446 and @xmath447 to determine the avalanche exponents .",
    "these then provide only lower bounds to @xmath436 and @xmath448 defined for avalanches whose size is not comparable to the size of the lattice .",
    "we have already mentioned that the probability of last wave of size @xmath30 varies as @xmath270 .",
    "another exact result known is the distribution of size of a wave generated at the corner of a wedge of angle @xmath449 , with particles allowed to leave system at boundaries . in this case ,",
    "priezzhev et al showed that probability of avalanche of size @xmath30 varies as @xmath450 , where @xmath451 @xcite .",
    "for a boundary avalanche , this gives @xmath452 .",
    "recently , the scaling picture of avalanches has been extended to study correlations between successive waves of toppling @xcite .",
    "on the basis of extensive numerical simulations , these authors have made the interesting observation that the conditional probability @xmath453 that the @xmath454-th wave is of size @xmath455 , given that the previous wave had @xmath30 topplings is roughly independent of @xmath65 .",
    "this varies as @xmath456 for @xmath457 , and as @xmath458 for @xmath459 . here",
    "@xmath460 and @xmath461 are some @xmath30-dependent amplitudes .",
    "however , the range of validity of these power - laws is limited to @xmath462 .",
    "it is useful to see how far asm can be generalized , still retaining its abelian group structure . in this section",
    ", i shall discuss an interesting generalization of the asm .",
    "the models consist of a network defined on a graph , on whose nodes sit processors , which are finite state automata .",
    "each of these has an input stack of messages . when the input stack of a processor is not empty , it pops one of the messages according to a predetermined order , and processes it . as a result of the processing",
    "its internal state may change , and some messages may be transmitted to its neighbors in the network , or to the outside world . then if the input stack is still not empty , the next message is processed , otherwise the processor idles .",
    "the processing rules for different processors may differ .",
    "in many applications , especially in computer science , one considers such networks where the speed of the individual processors is unknown , and where the final state and outputs generated should not depend on these speeds .",
    "then it is essential to construct the network so that the order at which messages arrive to the processors is immaterial .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the netwrok may be called abelian , and the model is named an abelian distributed processors ( adp ) model .",
    "evidently , the asm is an example of an abelian distributed processors model .",
    "another condition which may be imposed on an adp is the equivalent of the ` good behavior ' conditions for the asm .",
    "namely , that the response of the network to a single message sent to any of the processors terminates in a finite time , after which all the processors sit idle until further input is applied .",
    "the state in which all processors are idling , and all input stacks are empty is called a quiescent state .",
    "the quiescent states are the analogs of the stable configurations of the asm .    as in our discussion of the asm ,",
    "one may define generators @xmath463 whose action is to send message @xmath180 to processor @xmath42 .",
    "these generators commute , and generate an abelian semi - group , acting on the set of quiescent states ; restricted to the set of recurrent states , they form an abelian group .      as an example of an adp ,",
    "consider the following model defined on a square lattice of finite size @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "on each site sits an arrow pointing toward one of the four directions , up , down , left or right .",
    "a walker is placed on the lattice at one of the sites .",
    "the walker reaching a site resets the direction of the arrow at that site by rotating it by @xmath464 clockwise , and takes a step to the neighboring site in the new direction .",
    "it repeats this action , till it leaves the lattice .",
    "we add a walker at a randomly chosen site , wait till it leaves the system , and then add another walker .",
    "it is easy to see that this model is an example of the adp model .",
    "we can define commuting operators @xmath67 whose action on a configuration of arrows results in a new configuration of arrows obtained by adding a walker at @xmath42 and allowing it to move till it leaves the system .",
    "in fact , the algebra of the operators @xmath87 of introducing a walker at site @xmath63 is [ fig . 5 ] @xmath465 which is identical with the algebra of the asm on a square lattice .",
    "therefore we can apply the variation of the script test to see if a particular configuration is recurrent .",
    "however , it is easy to see directly that in a recurrent configuration the arrows form a directed spanning tree on the lattice .",
    "although the algebra is identical , the avalanches of this model are different from those of the asm .",
    "since the configuration does not become quiescent before the walker leaves the system , the typical avalanche size is @xmath466 in contrast with the @xmath467 avalanches which are most likely in the asm .",
    "thus we see again that the group structure of the algebra of operators can not by itself determine the avalanche exponents .",
    "several quantities of interest in this model have been studied . on an @xmath468 torus ,",
    "such a walker eventually ends up in a limit cycle , whose period is exactly @xmath469 , and it traverses each bond of the lattice exactly twice in one cycle , once in each direction .",
    "such a tour of the lattice is called an eulerian circuit , hence the name of the model .",
    "if a walker starts at origin in an initially random configuration of arrows , it reorganizes the arrows as it moves , and in low dimensions retraverses the already visited sites many times .",
    "its mean square deviation in time t increases as @xmath470 for @xmath471 and as @xmath93 for @xmath472 .    to make the connection to the asm more explicit ,",
    "consider a model in which we drop walkers on the board .",
    "each walker waits at the site where it is , except that if the number of walkers waiting at a site becomes greater than or equal to @xmath224 , @xmath224 walkers leave the site in consecutive clockwise directions , and the arrow is reset .",
    "the case @xmath473 corresponds to the eulerian walkers model the case @xmath474 corresponds to the asm . in this case",
    "the arrow is always reset to the same direction , and it does not matter which way .",
    "thus , we may forget about the arrows , and recover the asm .    in this intermediate case of @xmath475 ,",
    "small avalanches are possible , but the critical occupation number is two rather than four as in the asm .",
    "all these models have the same operator algebra .",
    "the analytical treatment of the @xmath475 model is surprizingly difficult , even on a bethe lattice , and the full solution has not been possible so far @xcite .",
    "another variation which falls in the adp category , is that of stochastic asm @xcite . in this model",
    "the critical height is two , but at each toppling , the neighbors to which the two grains are transferred are chosen at random with equal probablity to be either the up - down neighbors or the east - west neighbors .",
    "such dynamics may be performed by an adp by placing a pseudo - random number generator at each site , and using its output to choose the destination of the ejected sand .",
    "however , it is more convenient to think of the operation of toppling as being really random , so that the action of the opertor @xmath60 of adding a grain of sand at site @xmath42 does not yield a unique configuration , but rather a probablity distribution of configuration .",
    "using the vector space represention defined above for the asm with random driving , we see that the algebra of @xmath82 s becomes [ fig . 5 ]",
    "@xmath476 thus the operator algebra gains richer structure and it becomes a commutative ring .",
    "the set of equations  ( [ sasm ] ) written out for all the sites of the lattice yields a system of quadratic equations in many variables .",
    "this system is much more difficult to analyze than the system of linear equation for the deterministic asm , and not much is known about its solutions .",
    "let me conclude by discussing some of the interesting open problems in this field .",
    "the list is necessarily incomplete , and influenced by personal taste and prejudices .",
    "we can start with the problem of directed abelian sandpile models . in this case",
    ", we can calculate all the avalanche exponents in all dimensions .",
    "however , time - dependent correlation functions in the model have not been studied analytically so far . in particular",
    ", the power spectrum of the stochastic outflux of particles subjected to a steady slow input at top layer seems to be an interesting quantity .",
    "there is fairly convincing numerical evidence that this power spectrum is @xmath477 @xcite .",
    "it would be useful to establish this theoretically .",
    "another question related to time- dependent correlations is the distribution of residence time of grains in the pile .",
    "this distribution has been measured in experiments on ricepiles  @xcite .",
    "the directed model in two dimensions seems to be the simplest where the properties of such distributions can be studied .    for the undirected btw model in two dimensions , the most obvious unsolved question is determination of avalanche exponents .",
    "we mentioned earlier that the result that the chemical distance exponent for spanning trees in 2-dimensions is 5/4 comes from its connection to the potts model , and conformal field theory .",
    "the spanning trees problem is a rather classical problem in graph theory .",
    "it seems desirable to have an elementary ( say combinatorial ) proof of this result , which does not use the heavy machinery of conformal field theory .",
    "one would also like to have similar results in higher dimensions . more generally , most of the textbook results about spanning trees deal with the number of trees of specified local structure ( some specified edges absent , or present ) .",
    "however , questions about the large - scale geometrical structure of spanning trees are not so well studied @xcite .",
    "several other questions about the 2-dimensional model are rather intriguing , and are not understood yet .",
    "one is the structure of the unique recurrent state which corresponds to the identity element of the abelian group .",
    "this shows interesting structures , at several length scales , and is not understood .",
    "some good pictures may be found in @xcite .",
    "similar structures are seen if the btw model is relaxed from special unstable states ( like all heights @xmath478 @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , we can consider btw model , with initial height zero everywhere , and add particles only at the origin .",
    "as time evolves , the diameter of the region of space reached by the added grains increases as @xmath479 .",
    "however , the asymptotic shape of this region is not circular .",
    "if we grow the pile in a background of all heights @xmath115 , or on a chessboard pattern with half the sites of height @xmath238 and half of height @xmath115 , the shape is also not circular , but a different shape .",
    "one clearly sees some sharp facets [ fig .",
    "[ shape ] ] .",
    "an understanding of how such shapes are selected in this simple model is still lacking .      for the undirected asm s in higher dimensions , not much is known .",
    "it is usually believed that the upper critical dimension is @xmath222 .",
    "this has recently been shown by priezzhev @xcite , using the equivalence to the loop - erased random walk problem , and the fact that the upper critical dimension is 4 for intersections of paths of random walkers . however , we know that in the case of directed asm , introduction of an arbitrarily small stochasticity in the toppling rules can change the value of the upper critical dimension from @xmath228 to @xmath478 @xcite . whether a similar change in the upper critical dimension in the undirected case is not settled yet .",
    "there is some interest in understanding avalanche exponents on fractals @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the interest is that one can hope to use exact real - space renormalization group techniques .",
    "it turns out that abelian property is preserved under renormalization , but so far application of renormalization group techniques to soc has been somewhat ad - hoc @xcite .    for @xmath480",
    ", numerical simulations suggest that while avalanche clusters can have nontrivial topology ( two arms of propagating avalanche can join to form a ring ) , the clusters are not very ramified , and the fractal dimension of avalanche clusters is same as space dimension , i.e. number of distinct sites toppled scales as @xmath481 , where @xmath3 is the linear size of the avalanche",
    ". it would be nice to have a proof ( or disproof ) of this statement .    for the directed asm",
    ", we showed that there is a simple systematic way to exactly compute the probabilities of avalanches of sizes @xmath482 .",
    "this is not so for undirected models .",
    "the fact that one can calculate the probabilities of different heights in the steady state implies that we can calculate @xmath483 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath484 already involves the condition that all the neighbors of the toppled site are strictly below the critical height , which has not been calculated so far .    for the abelian models with stochastic toppling rules ,",
    "very little is known yet .",
    "the fact that introduction of stochasticity does not destroy the abelian property seems to be important .",
    "it seems that some of the treatment of the deterministic asm s can be extended to the stochastic case , and one can study the fsc s for the manna model @xcite .",
    "however a variation of the burning test to determine whether a given configuration is recurrent or not remains to be found for the manna model . also , it is not established that the critical exponent of the manna model are different from the deterministic case . in general , the question of universality classes of the sandpile models is still open .",
    "the relation of the avalanche propagation to propagation of infection in contact process with many absorbing states is also quite unclear yet @xcite . in general",
    ", the fact that avalanches correspond to propagation of activity in a medium , where the number of absorbing states of the medium is an exponentially increasing function of the number of sites in it , is quite unexceptional . in the case of the stochastic directed models studied by tadic and dhar @xcite",
    ", it was found that the critical exponents with stochasticity are related to those of directed percolation , but are ` renormalized ' by the conservation of mass condition .",
    "are the exponents of the undirected version of this model also related to directed percolation exponents ?",
    "an explicit solution would be very illuminating , even if only in the 1-dimensional case .",
    "i would like to thank dr .",
    "omri gat , who prepared the first version of the draft notes .",
    "i thank professors jean - pierre eckmann and michel droz of the university of geneva , and professor frederik scholtz of the university of stellenbosch and the south african organization of theoretical physicists for inviting me to give these lectures , and jean - pierre eckmann , omri gat and satya majumdar for carefully reading the draft manuscript .        a good introduction to various scaling laws in river - networks and references to earlier literature",
