    "since the late 90 s , it is known that our universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "the first evidence came from supernovae ia observations @xcite .",
    "thenceforth , evidences from baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite and cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite seem to strengthen this cosmological scenario .",
    "if one assumes general relativity ( gr ) as the background theory of gravity for a cosmological model , there is a necessity of considering @xmath0 of the universe is filled with some exotic fluid named dark energy , which would be the responsible for the cosmic acceleration .",
    "however such a universe set up , although provide good agreement with observations , fails in explaining or describing some issues , like hierarchy , coincidence and cosmological constant problems @xcite , among others .",
    "some of those issues may , in principle , be solved ( or at least evaded ) by assuming alternative models of gravity .",
    "an important class of alternative models arise from the assumption of a generalization of the ricci scalar dependence on einstein - hilbert action , from which gravity field equations are derived , namely @xmath1 theories @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a generalization of @xmath1 theories has been recently proposed by t. harko et al .",
    "@xcite , for which the gravitational part of the action depends not only on a function of @xmath2 but also on a function of @xmath3 , the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .    those theories have been intensively tested in the cosmological level ( check , for instance , @xcite-@xcite )",
    ". however , alternative models of gravity should also be tested in the astrophysical level .",
    "in fact , strong gravitational fields found in relativistic stars could discriminate standard gravity from its generalizations .    in what concerns",
    "@xmath1 theory astrophysical tests , in @xcite , the authors have obtained @xmath4 tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations , which were solved numerically using adaptive gaussian quadrature . a general @xmath1 model with uniformly collapsing cloud of self - gravitating dust particles was studied in @xcite . such an investigation could be used as a first approximation to the modification that stellar objects can suffer in modified theories of gravity . in @xcite , the gravitational field of stars",
    "were studied both analytically and numerically and generalized tov equations have been derived .",
    "@xmath5 gravity has also been tested in such a level . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have analyzed the dynamics of a spherically symmetric collapsing star surrounding in locally anisotropic environment with expansion - free condition , while in @xcite the authors have focused on the study of the stability of such objects .",
    "recently , another kind of alternative gravity model has been proposed , for which the metric is not considered a fundamental quantity .",
    "instead , it is taken as a function of an auxiliary metric @xmath6 and a scalar field @xmath7 , contemplating the so called mimetic gravity ( mg ) @xcite .",
    "note that such a dependence of the metric makes the application of the variational principle in the model action to yield more general equations of motion ( eom ) than that of purely einsteinian relativity theory .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that by introducing a potential for the mimetic non - dynamical scalar field , one can mimic nearly any gravitational properties of normal matter .",
    "it was also shown that in particular , mimetic matter can provide inflaton , quintessence and even lead to a bouncing non singular universe .",
    "symmetric static vacuum solutions were found for mg in @xcite .",
    "mg has been extended to @xmath1 gravity in @xcite while cosmological viable models derived from such an extension are presented in @xcite .    despite the references above , due to its recent elaboration",
    ", mg still presents a lack of cosmological and astrophysical application .",
    "our purpose in this work is to verify mg at an astrophysical level , by analysing compact objects . by compact object in astrophysics we mean a homogeneous distribution of ordinary ( or exotic ) matter with energy - momentum tensor in the form of a perfect non - viscous fluid .",
    "the key note to start studying the dynamics of such systems is to write the eom for a spherically static metric in schwarzschild - droste coordinates , denoted by @xmath8 . by rewriting the eom in terms of the hydrodynamic parameters ,",
    "hydrostatic pressure @xmath9 , energy density @xmath10 , and mass @xmath11 ( active mass inside the star ) , we will obtain the tov equations .",
    "the matter inside the compact star is composed of nuclear matter , sometimes in the form of strange quark matter @xcite , with a density of order @xmath12 . it is believed that this matter has ordinary statistical properties and can enter a series of second order phase transitions @xcite,@xcite",
    ".    we will derive tov equations in the mg framework and solve them for different equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mg ] we briefly describe mg . in section [ sec : mcs ] , a model of compact star in mg is presented from the development of the tov equations . in section [ sec",
    ": ns ] , numerical solutions for tov equations are obtained from both neutron star ( ns ) and quarks star ( qs ) eos , while in section [ sec : dis ] , we discuss the results .",
    "a generalization of the conformal transformations @xmath13 was introduced by j.d .",
    "bekenstein as disformal transformations @xcite :    @xmath14    here , @xmath7 is the scalar field and @xmath15 the kinetic term .",
    "a special case happens when we consider @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which is called mg .",
    "it was proven very recently that it can be interpreted as the same spirit as the disformal theory @xcite .",
    "in mg we consider the physical metric @xmath18 as a function of an auxiliary metric @xmath6 and of a scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "therefore one has @xmath19 .",
    "the mg action is therefore    @xmath20+\\mathcal{l}_m\\},\\ ] ]    for which @xmath21 is the matter lagrangian and @xmath22 denotes the newtonian gravitational constant . throughout this work",
    "we are going to assume units such that @xmath23 .    by varying this action with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 yields , respectively , the following eom @xcite :    @xmath24    @xmath25=0,\\ ] ]    with @xmath26 and @xmath3 being the trace of the einstein s tensor and of the energy - momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "the trace of the equation ( [ eqn : mg3 ] ) is : @xmath27 in order to obtain a scenario dynamically different from gr , we suppose that @xmath28 , and consequently obtain the following equivalent eom for the scalar field : @xmath29 this equation is in the hamilton - jacobi form and its general solution can be obtained by the same method .",
    "generally speaking , @xmath7 can be a complex variable , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that such an approach could explain the cold dark matter . here ,",
    "instead , we will analyze the interior of compact objects from the mg tov equations , which will be derived in the next section .",
    "we suppose that the metric of the compact star is static and spherically symmetric , with schwarzschild - droste coordinates @xmath31 in the following form : @xmath32 for which the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 depend on the coordinate @xmath35 only .",
    "for such a metric , the non vanishing components of the einstein s tensor read : @xmath36,\\\\ g_{44}&=&-\\sin^2\\theta g_{33},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for which primes denote derivation with respect to @xmath35 . by considering the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath37 , with @xmath10 and @xmath9 representing the density and pressure of the star , respectively , the diagonal components of ( [ eqn : mg3 ] ) are :    @xmath38    @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    also , the trace equation gives us the following : @xmath40 from this differential equation we observe clearly that the auxiliary scalar field @xmath7 can be a complex function , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "we must not be worried about this solution , because even in this case , the reparametrization of the physical metric @xmath18 does not yield a complex metric .    moreover ,",
    "the hydrostatic ( continuity ) equation @xmath41 for @xmath42 yields @xmath43 this equation does not deviate from the one derived from gr because the auxiliary scalar field introduces no extra ghost degree of freedom .",
    "the only contribution comes from the metric and the fluid .    in order to proceed with tov equations ,",
    "we redefine the metric function @xmath34 in terms of a mass function @xmath44 as follows : @xmath45 from this equation we can calculate the differential change in mass @xmath46 , as the mass which is stored in a layer with thickness @xmath47 in the spacetime , as the following : @xmath48,\\ ] ] with @xmath11 being the mass of the compact object .",
    "we can integrate @xmath46 to find the total ( active ) mass inside a region @xmath49\\}$ ] , with @xmath2 being the radius of the object .",
    "it was assumed that the mass enclosed inside the compact object is finite and a monotonic function of radial coordinate @xmath35 .",
    "the plan now is to rewrite eqs.([tt])-([p ] ) in terms of @xmath50 in a dimensionless form .",
    "to do so , we make the following sequence of definitions : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the mass of the sun",
    ".    such definitions yield ( [ dm])-([dm2 ] ) to convert to the following : @xmath58 using ( [ p],[dm ] ) in ( [ tt ] ) yields , for the ( @xmath59 ) component : @xmath60 while the ( @xmath61 ) and trace equations are , respectively : @xmath62 @xmath63    we can combine equations ( [ p],[eq11],[eq22],[eq33 ] ) and obtain : @xmath64 with the following constraints : @xmath65 .",
    "an alternative elimination process is to eliminate @xmath66 first , then @xmath67 and finally @xmath33 . from this procedure",
    "we obtain the following system of differential equations : @xmath68 with the following constraints @xmath69 but let us now revert to ( [ dyn1]-[dyn4 ] ) , which gives us a system of first order autonomous differential equations ( see @xcite for a review of dynamical systems approach in cosmology ) : @xmath70 these equations can be written in the form of an autonomous set of first order differential equations : @xmath71 we use ( [ dyn11]-[dyn44 ] ) to find all stationary points of the system .",
    "such points are the solutions of @xmath72 , with @xmath73 being an arbitrary value of @xmath35 . for our problem",
    "we can solve this and find the following stationary point : @xmath74 we can now linearize the system of equations ( [ dyn11]-[dyn44 ] ) in the vicinity of this critical point .",
    "the technique is to make @xmath75 and expand the function @xmath76 up to the first order of @xmath77 . in this case , thanks to the stationary condition , we will obtain the following set of first order  linear \" differential equations for the perturbations : @xmath78 here , the matrix of the coefficients is called  the jacobian matrix \" and is defined by @xmath79 . for our case we calculate it explicitly as follows : @xmath80,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath81 and by @xmath82 we mean @xmath83 .    to classify the stationary point as stable or unstable",

    "we will solve eqs.([p],[eq11],[eq22],[eq33 ] ) numerically with an auxiliary eos @xmath96 for each of the compact star models below . before starting to solve such equations for qs models ,",
    "it is worth stressing that qss are , indeed , likely to exist . in @xcite , for instance , it is presented a form of probing the existence of compact binaries containing at least one qs from the observation of gravitational waves .",
    "once qss existence is probed , the ground state of matter will be understood as that of strange matter , i.e. , a quark fluid with about equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks .",
    "let us start solving the system ( [ p],[eq11],[eq22],[eq33 ] ) by adopting the following quark matter eos @xcite : @xmath97 solutions for such a system are given , analytically , by the following elementary expressions :    @xmath98,\\ \\",

    "we did not observe any significant difference among the models .",
