    "ultraparabolic equations arise in several areas of science , such as mathematical biology in population dynamics @xcite and probability in connection with multi - parameter brownian motion @xcite , and in the theory of boundary layers @xcite . due to their applications ,",
    "ultraparabolic equations have gained considerable attention in many mathematical aspects ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .    in the mathematical literature , various types of ultraparabolic problems have been solved .",
    "there have been some papers dealing with the existence and uniqueness of solutions for ultraparabolic equations , e.g. @xcite . as the pioneer in numerical methods for such equations , akrivis et al .",
    "@xcite numerically approximated the solution of a prototype ultraparabolic equation by applying a fixed - step backward euler scheme and second - order box - type finite difference method .",
    "some extension works for the numerical angle should be mentioned are @xcite by a. ashyralyev - s .",
    "yilmaz and michael d. marcozzi , respectively .",
    "we also remark that , in general , ultraparabolic equations do not possess properties that are closely fundamental to many kinds of parabolic equations including strong maximum principles , a priori estimates , and so on .    in the phase of ultraparabolic ill - posed problems , the authors f. zouyed and f. rebbani , very recently , proposed in @xcite the modified quasi - boundary value method to regularize the solution of the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) in homogeneous backward case @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , via the instability terms in the form of the solution of ( [ eq:1 ] ) ( cf .",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) ) they established an approximate problem by replacing @xmath15 for the operator @xmath16 and taking the perturbation @xmath17 into final conditions of the ill - posed problem , and obtained the convergence order @xmath18 .",
    "motivated by that work , this paper is devoted to investigate a new regularization method .    in the past , many approaches have been studied for solving ill - posed problems , especially the backward heat problems . for example ,",
    "latts and lions @xcite , showalter @xcite and boussetila and rebbani @xcite used quasi - reversibility method ; in @xcite ames et al . applied the least squares method with tikhonov - type regularization ; clark and oppenheimer @xcite , denche and bessila @xcite and trong et al .",
    "@xcite used quasi - boundary value method . moreover , some other methods should be listed are the mollification method by hao @xcite and the operator - splitting method studied by kirkup and wadsworth @xcite . to the best of the author",
    "s knowledge , although there are many works on several types of parabolic backward problems , the theoretical literature on regularizing the inverse problems for ultraparabolic equations is very scarce .",
    "therefore , proposing a regularization method for the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) is the scope of this paper .",
    "our work presented in this paper has the following features .",
    "firstly , for ease of the reading , we summarize in section 2 some well - known facts in semi - group of operator and present the formula of the solution of ( [ eq:1 ] ) . secondly ,",
    "in section 3 we construct the regularized solution based on our method , then obtain the error estimate .",
    "finally , a numerical example is given in section 4 to illustrate the efficiency of the result .",
    "the operator @xmath19 is a positive self - adjoint unbounded linear operator on @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it can be applied to some elementary results in @xcite .",
    "particularly , the formula of the solution of the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be obtained by l. lorenzi et al . @xcite and the authors in @xcite gave a detailed description on fundamental properties of the generalized operator . in this section ,",
    "we thus recall those results in which we want to apply to our main results in this paper .",

    "now we return to the consideration of problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "all of our results in this paper apply to more general problems , for which the boundary conditions are generalized in robin - type , for example ,    @xmath78    @xmath79    or we can consider , in general , the operator equations with the self - adjoint operator @xmath16 having a discrete spectrum on an abstract hilbert space @xmath21 and satisfying the condition that @xmath25 generates a compact contraction semi - group on @xmath21 , like the problem ( [ eq:2 ] ) considered above .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we confine our attention to the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) in which the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions at the endpoints of @xmath80 $ ] are given . in this problem",
    ", we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so there exists an orthonormal basis of @xmath2 , @xmath83 satisfying ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath84\\right),\\quad\\delta\\phi_{n}=-\\lambda_{n}\\phi_{n},\\quad0<\\lambda_{1}\\le\\lambda_{2}\\le ... \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\lambda_{n}=\\infty.\\ ] ]    the laplace operator thus has a discrete spectrum @xmath85 with @xmath86 and gives the orthonormal eigenbasis @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "then , thanks to those theorems above , the solution has the form    @xmath89    where    @xmath90    we can see that the instability is caused by all of the exponential functions .",
    "in fact , let us see the case @xmath49 in ( [ eq:8 ] ) . since the discrete spectrum increases monotonically as @xmath91 tends to infinity , the rapid escalation of @xmath92 and @xmath93 is mainly the instability cause . even though these exact given functions @xmath94 may tend to zero very fast , performing classical calculation is impossible .",
    "it is because that the given data may be diffused by a variety of reasons such as round - off errors , measurement errors .",
    "a small perturbation in the data can arbitrarily generate a large error in the solution . a regularization method is thus required .",
    "in this section , assuming that the problem has an exact solution @xmath48 satisfying various corresponding assumptions , we construct the regularized solution depending continuously on the data such that converges to the exact solution @xmath48 in some sense .",
    "moreover , the accuracy of regularized solution is estimated .    the solution of ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "can be given by    @xmath95    we shall replace all instability terms by the better ones , particularly , @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a real number . then , the regularized solution corresponding to the exact data is    @xmath99    for any @xmath49 , and    @xmath100    for any @xmath51 .",
    "we also denote the regularized solution corresponding to the perturbed data by    @xmath101    for any @xmath49 , and    @xmath102    for any @xmath51 .",
    "now we shall show two elementary inequalities in the following lemmas .    for @xmath103 ,",
    "we have    @xmath104    it is obvious that @xmath105 since @xmath106 .    for all @xmath107 , @xmath108 we have    @xmath109    the proof of this lemma is based on the fact that @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we have    @xmath111^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which leads to    @xmath112    in the sequel , we only prove the case @xmath49 in our main result because of the similarity .",
    "the results are about the regularized solution depending continuously on the corresponding data and the convergence of that solution to the exact solution .",
    "now we shall use two elementary lemmas above to support the proof of the main results .    under the conditions ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) , ( a4 ) and",
    "assume that @xmath70 , then the function @xmath113 given by ( [ eq:10])-([eq:11 - 1 ] ) depends continuously on @xmath11 in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath114 and @xmath115 be two solutions of ( [ eq:10])-([eq:11 - 1 ] ) corresponding to the data @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively . by using parseval relation , for @xmath49",
    "we have    @xmath118    similarly , for any @xmath51 , we get    @xmath119    under the conditions ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) and ( a4 ) , if the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) with @xmath70 admits a unique solution @xmath48 satisfying    @xmath120    and    @xmath121    where @xmath122 , let @xmath12 be perturbed functions satisfying the conditions ( a1)-(a2 ) , respectively , and let @xmath123 be the regularized solution , given by ( [ eq:11])-([eq:12 ] ) , corresponding to the perturbed data @xmath12 , then for @xmath49 we have    @xmath124    and for @xmath51 ,    @xmath125    for any @xmath49 , we have    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    using triangle inequality , in order to get the error estimate , we have to estimate @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "indeed , we get    @xmath131    next , @xmath130 can be estimated as follows .",
    "we put    @xmath132    then we have    @xmath133    therefore , we conclude that    @xmath134    now using parseval relation again , we thus obtain    @xmath135    thanks to lemma 6 and the assumption ( [ eq:14 - 1 ] ) , we have    @xmath136    combining ( [ eq:16])-([eq:17 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath137    similarly , we obtain the error estimate    @xmath138    for the case @xmath51 with the assumption ( [ eq:15 ] ) .    hence , we complete the proof .    from theorem 8",
    ", we can see that @xmath139 strongly converges to @xmath140 in @xmath2 for any @xmath141\\times\\left[0,t\\right]$ ] as @xmath142 tends to zero .",
    "one advantage of this method is that the endpoints of time @xmath143\\times\\left[0,t\\right]$ ] , for example , @xmath144 and @xmath145 nearly have the same rate of convergence in some cases .",
    "indeed , the convergence speed at @xmath144 is @xmath146 and it is of order @xmath142 for @xmath145 .",
    "then , if @xmath147 is very large for any fixed @xmath148 , the order @xmath146 may approach @xmath142 .",
    "this creates the globally stability behavior of the error in numerical sense . on the other hand , the natural acceptance of ( [ eq:14 - 1])-([eq:15 ] )",
    "can be obtained at @xmath144 .",
    "namely , by letting @xmath149 the conditions become    @xmath150    moreover , the error is of order @xmath151 for all @xmath141\\times\\left[0,t\\right]$ ] .",
    "if @xmath152 , this error is faster than the order @xmath153 as @xmath154 which is studied in many works , such as @xcite . combining the strong points above",
    ", the reader can infer that our method is feasible .",
    "in order to see how well the method works , we consider as an example the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) by choosing    @xmath155 and the domain @xmath80\\times\\left[0,1\\right]^{2}$ ] . for these given functions ,",
    "the problem has a unique solution    @xmath156    now let us take perturbation on data functions as follows . for @xmath157 , we define    @xmath158    @xmath159    thus , the solution corresponding to the perturbed data functions is    @xmath160    it is easy to see that @xmath161 converges to @xmath11 over the norm @xmath2 as @xmath162 . to observe the ill - posedness ,",
    "we can compute , for example , @xmath163 and    @xmath164    therefore , we get    @xmath165    as @xmath162 .",
    "this divergence is also showed in figure 1 with @xmath166 and @xmath167 .     and the approximation solution within perturbations @xmath168 . ]    .comparison of absolute errors between the regularized solutions @xmath169 of @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
