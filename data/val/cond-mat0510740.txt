    "a geometric analysis of the continuum scaling limit ( where the lattice spacing @xmath2 ) of critical two - dimensional percolation has been carried out in recent years . in the case of site percolation on the triangular lattice , this analysis , which built on work of cardy  @xcite , aizenman  @xcite and aizenman and burchard  @xcite , is now entirely rigorous .",

    "then smirnov  @xcite proved convergence of crossing probabilities for the triangular lattice to the conformally invariant cardy formulas  @xcite and sketched an argument for the convergence of the exploration path to @xmath4 ( see  @xcite for a detailed proof of this convergence ) and finally camia and newman constructed  @xcite a certain loop process and proved convergence to it  @xcite of the",
    " full scaling limit \" on the triangular lattice ",
    "i.e. , proved that the collection of the boundaries of all the ( macroscopic ) critical clusters converges in distribution to that process of countably many continuum nonsimple loops in the plane .",
    "some properties of this critical loop process will be reviewed in section  [ clp ] .",
    "meanwhile , we point out one crucial feature that plays a key role throughout this paper  namely that although there is no self - crossing of a loop or crossing of different loops , there is a considerable amount of self - touching of loops ( i.e. , the loops are non - simple ) and touching between different loops .",
    "double points _ of the loop process in the plane , as we will discuss in section  [ marking ] , are exactly the continuum limits of  macroscopically pivotal \" lattice locations ; each such site ( or bond , depending on the microscopic model in question ) is microscopic , but such that a change in its state ( e.g. , black to white or closed to open ) has a macroscopic effect on connectivity . for site percolation on the triangular lattice ( or equivalently random black / white colorings of the hexagonal lattice  see figure  [ percolation ] ) , a macroscopically pivotal site is a hexagon at the center of four macroscopic arms with alternating colors  see figure  [ pivotal ] .",
    "the critical value for triangular lattice site percolation ( or square lattice bond percolation ) with probability @xmath7 of a site being white ( or a bond being open ) is @xmath8 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to propose , and then analyze , a geometric framework for scaling limits of _ near - critical _ models where @xmath9 as @xmath2 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 chosen so that macroscopic connectivity functions in the scaling limit have a nontrivial dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "we note that scaling theory  @xcite and the results of  @xcite indicate that the correct choice is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the correlation length exponent . except for section  [ mst ] , we will focus on site percolation on the triangular lattice , or equivalently , random colorings of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "the analysis done in this paper is nonrigorous since our purpose here is not to prove theorems but rather to propose a _",
    "framework rich enough to treat scaling limits of near - critical percolation and of related lattice objects like the minimal spanning tree .",
    "we hope however that our framework will be the foundation for an eventual detailed rigorous analysis of near - critical and related two - dimensional scaling limits .",
    "the framework we propose , based on a  marking process \" for the double points of the critical ( @xmath14 ) full scaling limit of  @xcite , is presented in section  [ marking ] below .",
    "it provides a random marking of countably many double points , with each of these labelled by a number in @xmath15 representing the value of @xmath5 at which that double point changes its state and hence correspondingly changes macroscopic connections , loops , etc .",
    "this yields a realization on a single probability space of all the scaling limits as @xmath5 varies in @xmath15 .",
    "we point out that most double points are not marked since they do not change their state for a finite value of @xmath5 ( in the limit @xmath2 )  it is only the marked ones that change .",
    "we also note that an analogous , but simpler , marking procedure involving double points of the  brownian web \" has been used in  @xcite to perturb around the scaling limit of zero - temperature coarsening models in one plus one dimensional space - time .    in section  [ connectivity ]",
    "we explain how the original full scaling limit at the critical point ( what we now call the @xmath16-loop process ) and the marking of double points are together sufficient to yield the scaling limit , simultaneously for all @xmath5 , of connectivity probabilities and cluster boundary loops in the lattice model with @xmath9 . in section  [ perc ]",
    "we analyze the percolation transition for the continuum model as @xmath5 varies and give a description of what is seen for @xmath17 inside the critical scaling window , i.e. , on a spatial scale ( of the order of one correlation length ) where the system continues to look critical .",
    "finally , in section  [ mst ] we discuss another natural scaling limit that should be constructible from the @xmath18-loop process combined with marked double points  namely , the continuum minimal spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "this will be explored in more detail along with other scaling limits , such as of the tree dual to the mst , the lattice filling curve that separates the two trees , the @xmath5-exploration path , invasion percolation , and dynamical percolation  @xcite , in another paper  @xcite .    at the discrete level , objects like the mst are most easily described for bond percolation on the square lattice , so in the last section we will focus on that microscopic model in our discussions . on the other hand , the self - matching property of the triangular lattice , such that the percolation process and its dual live on the same lattice , makes that lattice particularly convenient to work with , so we will use that discrete model in the rest of the paper .",
    "it is also the case that all the _ rigorous _ work about the scaling limit of percolation is so far limited to site percolation on the triangular lattice . of course , because of universality , the choice of lattice should not be relevant after the scaling limit is taken .",
    "at the percolation critical point , with probability one there is no infinite cluster ( rigorously proved only in two dimensions and high dimension ) ; therefore the percolation cluster boundaries form loops ( see figure  [ percolation ] ) .",
    "we will refer to the continuum scaling limit ( as the mesh @xmath19 of the lattice goes to zero ) of the collection of all these loops as the continuum nonsimple loop process ; its existence and some of its properties have been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the cluster boundaries are naturally directed so that , for example , following a boundary according to its direction , white is to the left and black to the right .",
    "this gives to the collection of all boundaries a nested structure in which loops of opposite orientation alternate .",
    "the limiting ( as @xmath2 ) loops also have this property .    the continuum nonsimple loop process can be described as a  conformally invariant gas \" of loops , or more precisely , a conformally invariant probability measure on countable collections of continuous , nonsimple , noncrossing , fractal loops in the plane .",
    "the loops can and do touch themselves and each other many times , but there is zero probability for the occurrence of any triple points ; i.e. , no three or more loops can come together at the same point , and a single loop can not touch the same point more than twice , nor can a loop touch a point where another loop touches itself .    any deterministic point @xmath20 in the plane ( i.e. , chosen independently of the loop process ) is surrounded by an infinite family of nested loops with diameters going to both zero and infinity .",
    "consequently , any two distinct deterministic points of the plane are separated by loops winding around each of them .",
    "however , any annulus about the deterministic point @xmath20 with inner radius @xmath21 and outer radius @xmath22 contains only a finite number @xmath23 of loops surrounding @xmath20 .",
    "another important property of the loop process is that any two loops are connected by a finite `` path '' of touching loops .",
    "a continuum nonsimple loop process with the same distribution as the full scaling limit of critical percolation can be constructed directly by an inductive procedure in which each loop is obtained as the concatenation of an @xmath4 path with ( a portion of ) another @xmath4 path ( see subsection  [ single - loop ] ) .",
    "this procedure is carried out first in a finite region @xmath24 of the plane , and then an infinite volume limit , @xmath25 , is taken ( see  @xcite ) .    two simple examples of the type of connectivity / crossing probabilities that can be expressed in terms of the continuum nonsimple loop process are given below .",
    "the formulation of these connectivity / crossing probabilities in terms of a conformally invariant loop process implies the conformal invariance of such quantities ( early discussions of scaling limits of connectivity functions and of the consequences of conformal invariance for such quantities are given in  @xcite ) .",
    "the examples will also highlight the natural nested structure of the collection of percolation cluster boundaries in the scaling limit .",
    "consider first an annulus centered at @xmath20 with inner radius @xmath26 and outer radius @xmath27 ( see figure  [ annulus ] ) .",
    "the scaling limit @xmath28 of the probability of a crossing of the annulus ( by crossing here we refer to a  monochromatic \" crossing , i.e. , a crossing by either of the two colors  see figure  [ percolation ] ) can be expressed in terms of the loop counting random variable @xmath29 defined above : @xmath28 is the probability that @xmath29 equals zero . more generally , @xmath29 represents the scaling limit of the minimal number of cluster boundaries traversed by paths connecting the inner and outer circles of the annulus .        an example with more geometric structure involves two disjoint discs @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the plane and the scaling limit @xmath32 of the probability that there is a crossing from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( see figure  [ discs ] ) .",
    "here we let @xmath33 denote the number of distinct loops in the plane that contain @xmath30 in their interior and @xmath31 in their exterior , and define @xmath34 in the complementary way .",
    "the scaling limit of the minimal number of cluster boundaries that must be crossed to connect @xmath30 to @xmath31 is @xmath35 , and @xmath32 is the probability that @xmath36 . in the latter case , whether there is a white crossing between @xmath30 and @xmath31 or a black crossing or both will be discussed in section  [ connectivity ] below .",
    "one can also consider , as in  @xcite , the probability that a single monochromatic cluster in the exterior @xmath37 of the union of @xmath38 disjoint discs ( or other regions ) connects all @xmath38 disc boundaries . in the scaling limit , this can be expressed as the probability of the event that there is a single continuous ( nonsimple ) curve in @xmath37 touching all @xmath38 disc boundaries that _ does not cross any of the loops of the continuum nonsimple loop process .",
    "_    we remark that the continuum nonsimple loop process described in this section is presumably just one example of a family of  conformal loop ensembles \" ( see  @xcite ) that are related to @xmath39 and to the gaussian free field , and are conjectured to describe the full scaling limit of many statistical mechanics models besides percolation , such as ising , potts and @xmath40 models",
    ".      we will not give here the inductive construction of the full scaling limit ( see  @xcite ) , but in order to familiarize the reader with the loop process , we explain in this subsection how to construct a single loop by using two @xmath4 paths inside a domain @xmath24 whose boundary is assumed to have a given orientation  see figure  [ fig - sec3 ] , where the orientation is clockwise .",
    "this is done in three steps , of which the first consists in choosing two points @xmath41 and @xmath42 on the boundary @xmath43 of @xmath24 and `` running '' a chordal @xmath4 , @xmath44 $ ] , from @xmath41 to @xmath42 inside @xmath24 .",
    "we consider @xmath45 $ ] as an oriented path , with orientation from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the set @xmath46 $ ] is a countable union of its connected components , which are each open and simply connected . if @xmath20 is a deterministic point in @xmath24 , then with probability one , @xmath20 is not touched by @xmath47  @xcite and so it belongs to a unique domain in @xmath46 $ ]",
    ".    the components of @xmath46 $ ] can be conveniently thought of in terms of how a point @xmath20 in the interior of the component was first `` trapped '' at some time @xmath48 by @xmath49 $ ] , perhaps together with either @xmath50 or @xmath51 ( the portions of the boundary @xmath43 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 counterclockwise or clockwise respectively ) : ( 1 ) those components whose boundary contains a segment of @xmath51 between two successive visits at @xmath52 and @xmath53 to @xmath51 ( where here and below @xmath54 ) , ( 2 ) the analogous components with @xmath51 replaced by the other part of the boundary , @xmath50 , ( 3 ) those components formed when @xmath55 with @xmath47 winding about @xmath20 in a counterclockwise direction between @xmath56 and @xmath48 , and finally ( 4 ) the analogous clockwise components .",
    "now , let @xmath57 be a domain of type 1 ( if @xmath43 were counterclockwise , we would take a domain of type 2 ) and let @xmath58 and @xmath59 be respectively the starting and ending point of the excursion @xmath60 that generated @xmath57 .",
    "the second step to construct a loop is to run a chordal @xmath4 , @xmath61 , inside @xmath57 from @xmath59 to @xmath58 ; the third and final step consists in pasting together @xmath60 and @xmath62 , keeping their orientations .    running @xmath62 inside @xmath57 from @xmath59 to @xmath58 partitions @xmath63 into new domains , all of whose boundaries have a well defined orientation , so that the construction of loops just presented can be iterated inside each one of these domains ( as well as inside each of the domains of type  2 , 3 and 4 generated by @xmath64 in the first step ) .",
    "for the complete inductive procedure generating all the loops inside @xmath24 , we refer the reader to  @xcite .     in three steps .",
    "a domain @xmath24 is formed by the solid curve .",
    "the dashed curve is an excursion @xmath60 ( from a to b ) of an @xmath4 @xmath47 in @xmath24 that creates a subdomain @xmath57 containing @xmath20 .",
    "( neither the rest of @xmath47 nor its starting and ending points , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are indicated in the figure . )",
    "the dotted curve @xmath62 is an @xmath4 in @xmath57 from b to a. a loop is formed by @xmath60 followed by @xmath62.,width=302 ]",
    "the coupling ( i.e. , the realization on a single probability space ) of the @xmath5-loop processes for all @xmath65 ( with a symmetric picture applying for @xmath66 ) hinges on an ansatz about the evolution of macroscopic loops at the lattice level as @xmath5 increases from @xmath18 . note first that at the lattice level , there is a standard way to couple all choices of @xmath5 by means of i.i.d .",
    "uniform @xmath67 random variables @xmath68 assigned to the hexagons , labelled by @xmath69 .",
    "we then call a hexagon white for the @xmath5-lattice model ( or more simply @xmath5-white ) if @xmath70 , so that a hexagon flips from black to white at the value of @xmath5 where @xmath71 crosses the value of @xmath68 .",
    "note next that there are two ways in which a macroscopic loop will change macroscopically in this setting : either by merging with another macroscopic loop , or by splitting into two macroscopic loops .",
    "the ansatz is that in both cases the change takes place by the flipping to white of single black hexagons located either where two distinct macroscopic boundary contours `` touch '' each other ( more precisely , come to distance @xmath19 from each other ) , or where a single macroscopic boundary contour `` touches '' itself ( i.e. , comes to a distance @xmath19 from itself ) . in the first case the change from black to white will produce a new macroscopic contour ; in the second case two new contours are formed ( and an additional proviso of the ansatz is that both new contours are macroscopic ) . each of the two cases has two subcases , as will be made more explicit in section  [ connectivity ] in the context of the continuum model .",
    "a hexagon at such a location is a black hexagon ( at @xmath14 ) which has the macroscopic alternating four - arm property , requiring that there exist four alternating ( as one goes around the hexagon ) white and black macroscopic paths ( of hexagons ) touching the sides of the given hexagon .",
    "such hexagons , whether they be black or white , will be termed _",
    "important_. the ansatz is that these are the only relevant hexagons , and other black hexagons ( at @xmath14 ) do not play any ( macroscopic ) role when flipping to white as @xmath5 increases from @xmath18 . in particular , it should not be necessary to consider macroscopic changes produced by the flipping of two or more hexagons , each having just a microscopic effect on its own .",
    "this is so because , as @xmath5 increases , the probability of flipping two or more hexagons is negligible compared to the probability of flipping a single hexagon , and can be neglected , as long as the number of possible pairs , triplets , etc . of hexagons",
    "whose coordinated flipping produces a macroscopic effect is not significantly larger than the number of single hexagons whose flipping has a macroscopic effect .",
    "suppose we denote by @xmath72 the number of @xmath73-tuples ( singlets , pairs , triplets , etc . ) of hexagons in a fixed spatial region",
    "whose simultaneous flipping produces a macroscopic change ( but the flipping of any @xmath74 of them does not do so ) .",
    "our ansatz relies on the hypothesis that @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "this is because the probability @xmath77 of a significant @xmath73-tuple flip will scale as @xmath78 and so @xmath79 will imply that @xmath80 for @xmath76 .",
    "the flipping ( black to white ) of important hexagons will be governed by the uniform random variables @xmath68 assigned to them .",
    "an important hexagon is marked with a label @xmath81 if the random variable @xmath68 assigned to it equals @xmath82 .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 is chosen so that @xmath83 scales like @xmath84 ; at the end of this section , we discuss why @xmath85 . in the limit @xmath2 ,",
    "the set of marked hexagons ( or rather , mark locations ) along with their labels should converge in distribution to a poissonian point process in @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , and that is crucial , the set of marked important locations together with the ensemble of ( @xmath14)-contours should converge jointly to the above mentioned point process together with the continuum nonsimple loop process , where the poissonian nature of the point process is conditional on the realization of the loop process . at the discrete level",
    "the @xmath5-marks are located on macroscopic contours at touching points of two distinct such contours or at points where a single such contour touches itself ( with the additional proviso mentioned earlier ) .",
    "the same will hold in the continuum , namely the @xmath5-marks are located at touching points of two distinct loops or at points where a single loop touches itself .",
    "now let us briefly describe the merging and splitting going on to form @xmath5-loops from continuum non - simple loops ( corresponding to @xmath87 ) together with the @xmath5-marks .",
    "a more complete discussion will be presented in section  [ connectivity ] .",
    "let us start with the merging of two counterclockwise continuum nonsimple loops .",
    "suppose for a moment that these two loops are isolated from the rest of the loop system , so that what we describe next makes proper sense .",
    "without recourse to this assumption , it makes sense only in a local way ; a global description is given in section  [ connectivity ] .",
    "we look at the marked touching points of these two loops , and select the one with the smallest @xmath5-value , say @xmath81 , which will be strictly positive by the scaling assumption ( i.e. , by the choice of @xmath11 ) .",
    "then , as @xmath5 increases from @xmath18 past @xmath81 , the two @xmath18-loops merge into a single counterclockwise loop using the point with the @xmath81-value , which now becomes a point of the resulting loop where it touches itself .",
    "the splitting of a single counterclockwise loop is similar . as in the previous paragraph",
    ", we make a simplifying ( but presumably technically incorrect ) assumption to avoid global considerations  in this case that among the marks appearing at the points where this loop touches itself there is a strictly positive smallest @xmath5-value , say @xmath88 .",
    "then , as @xmath5 increases from @xmath18 past @xmath88 , the loop splits into two loops , one counterclockwise loop and a second one clockwise in the interior of the counterclockwise loop , through the point with the @xmath88-value , which now becomes a point where the resulting loops touch each other .",
    "we end the section with an explanation of why @xmath85 .",
    "it relies on the above discussed correspondence of important points to those having the four - arm property .",
    "it is known that the probability that a unit macroscopic disk centered at a given hexagon is such that the hexagon at the center has the four arm property , with each arm touching the boundary of the disk , scales like @xmath89 .",
    "this suggests that the number @xmath83 of important hexagons in a fixed macroscopic volume is of order @xmath90 , and so in order to obtain in the limit a process of important marked points , we should scale the probability for a mark at each of the @xmath91 important hexagons by @xmath92 ; thus @xmath85 .",
    "we note that this exponent is the same as the one of the scaling window in  @xcite , where the scaling of the sizes of near - critical large clusters is studied .",
    "this is also the scale that makes the correlation length of order @xmath93 , an observation that will be important later on ( see section  [ perc ] ) .",
    "in this section we show how the marking procedure discussed in the previous section allows us to describe the scaling limit connectivity probabilities for the one - parameter family of near - critical models with @xmath94 . as discussed in section  [ clp ] , in the critical case ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "two disjoint regions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , of the plane are connected ( by a monochromatic path ) if there is no loop surrounding one region but not the other .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that there is a continuous path from @xmath30 to @xmath31 that does not _ cross _ any loops ( although it can _ touch _ loops ) . to determine whether there is a white connecting path or a black one or both ,",
    "let @xmath95 for @xmath96 denote the smallest loop surrounding @xmath97 .",
    "in the situation we are considering where there is a monochromatic connecting path , there are three disjoint possibilities ( see figure  [ connections ] )  either ( 1 ) there is a loop @xmath98 touching both @xmath30 and @xmath31 , or ( 2 ) there is no such @xmath98 and @xmath99 , in which case we define @xmath100 , or ( 3 ) there is no such @xmath98 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 surrounds @xmath103 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath103 surrounds @xmath102 ) , in which case we define @xmath104 ( resp . , @xmath105 ) .",
    "note that in case ( 3 ) , @xmath103 touches @xmath31 ( resp . , @xmath102 touches @xmath30 ) . in case",
    "( 1 ) , there are both white and black connecting paths ; in cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , there is a white but no black connecting path if @xmath106 is oriented counterclockwise , and otherwise there is a black but no white connecting path .     on the left and the disc @xmath31 on the right .",
    "in ( 1 ) , there are both white ( w ) and black ( b ) connections ; in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , there is only a white connection.,width=302 ]    the special case in which @xmath30 and @xmath31 are single points , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , is also included , but has to be treated with some care because if @xmath109 and @xmath110 are arbitrary deterministic points of the plane , the probability that they are connected is zero . nevertheless , it may be instructive to think about this special case in the lattice setting .",
    "there , if the smallest boundary loop surrounding both @xmath109 and @xmath110 has counterclockwise orientation and there is no boundary loop surrounding either of the two points but not the other , then the hexagon containing @xmath109 and that containing @xmath110 are in the same white cluster and thus there is a path of white hexagons connecting them .",
    "now let us consider some @xmath111 and look at the @xmath81-white connections .",
    "since this case corresponds to the scaling limit of models with @xmath112 , the white connectivity is  enhanced \" and a @xmath81-white path from @xmath30 to @xmath31 is _ allowed to cross _ critical ( @xmath14 ) loops , _ provided that it only crosses them at marked sites with _ @xmath113 . for every @xmath114 , this rule defines the set of all @xmath81-white paths and connections . using this definition",
    ", we can now consider the probability of connectivity events of the type described in section  [ clp ] for the continuum @xmath81-percolation .",
    "for example , given an annulus with inner radius @xmath115 and outer radius @xmath116 , we can ask for the probability of the event that there is a @xmath81-white crossing of the annulus .",
    "this is the scaling limit , as @xmath2 , of the corresponding probability for the discrete percolation model with @xmath117 .",
    "the notion of @xmath81-connectivity leads to the definition of a @xmath81-white cluster as a maximal set of points that are connected by @xmath81-white paths . in the special case of @xmath118 , a continuum white cluster",
    "can also be defined as the union of a counterclockwise @xmath18-loop with its interior minus the interiors of all its daughter ( clockwise ) domains .",
    "this notion will appear again later , in section  [ mst ] .",
    "the idea of @xmath81-connectivity raises a natural question concerning the percolation transition value for the continuum percolation model as @xmath81 varies , where percolation in this context means the existence of a @xmath81-white path to infinity . from known properties of the critical ( @xmath118 ) model ,",
    "namely that every disc is surrounded by infinitely many loops , it follows that there is no percolation for @xmath118 , so @xmath118 is a natural candidate for the transition value .",
    "however , a priori , it could have happened that the probability of a @xmath81-white path to infinity is zero not only at @xmath118 , but for all ( or some ) @xmath119 . in the next section",
    "we will show that this is not the case and that the probability of a @xmath81-white path to infinity is strictly positive ( in fact , equal to one , if no starting region is specified ) for every @xmath111 .",
    "so far we have discussed @xmath81-connectivity , but now we focus on the related notion of @xmath81-loops , i.e. , the scaling limit as @xmath2 of the collection of all boundary loops when @xmath117 .",
    "by analogy with the critical ( @xmath118 ) case and the definition of white paths there , the guiding idea is to define @xmath81-loops in such a way that @xmath81-white paths _ do not cross _ any @xmath81-loop . in order to ensure this , one needs to merge together various @xmath18-loops and split other @xmath18-loops , where the merging and splitting takes place at marked double points and the decisions to merge or split depend on the value associated to the mark and on @xmath81 .",
    "the result of all this merging and splitting will be the collection of @xmath81-loops .    for @xmath111 , the splitting of a @xmath18-loop ( respectively , merging of two @xmath18-loops ) , caused by a black to white flip , takes place at a marked double point of the loop ( respectively , where the two loops touch ) with @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "there are two types of splitting and two types of merging ( see figure  [ split - merg ] ) :    * the splitting of a counterclockwise loop into an outer counterclockwise and an interior clockwise loop , * the splitting of a clockwise loop into two adjacent clockwise loops , * the merging of a counterclockwise loop with the smallest clockwise loop that contains it into a clockwise loop , and * the merging of two adjacent counterclockwise loops into a counterclockwise loop .",
    "the case @xmath121 is of course exactly symmetric to the one described here with splittings and mergings caused by white to black flips .        before concluding this section",
    ", we point out that things are more complex than they may first appear , based on the previous discussion .",
    "this is because the critical loop process is scale invariant and each configuration contains infinitely many loops at all scales , which implies that in implementing the merging / splitting , one needs in principle both a small scale @xmath122-cutoff and a large scale @xmath106-cutoff .",
    "this means that the merging / splitting is first done only for loops touching a square centered at the origin of side length @xmath106 and takes place only if both loops involved in the merging or both loops resulting from the splitting have diameter larger than @xmath122 . for every @xmath123 , this ensures that the number of merging and splitting operations is finite . at a later stage one takes both @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "in this section we give a description of the system with @xmath117 and @xmath111 , within the spatial scaling window where it looks critical . as a result of this analysis",
    ", we will answer the question regarding continuum @xmath81-percolation , as anticipated in the previous section .",
    "first , we note that the order of magnitude of the linear dimension of the critical scaling window is given by the correlation length ( measured in lattice units ) @xmath126 where @xmath1 is the correlation length exponent",
    ". an important consequence of the choice of @xmath85 is that @xmath127 is of order @xmath128 as @xmath2 .",
    "considering the percolation probability on the lattice that the origin belongs to an infinite white cluster , @xmath129 , we can write @xmath130 where @xmath131 . we thus see the one - arm exponent @xmath132 appear , with @xmath133 giving the order of magnitude of the @xmath134-probability ( i.e. , calculated with @xmath8 ) that in the critical case there is a white path starting at the origin and extending all the way to the boundary of the disc of radius @xmath128 ( measured in lattice units ) .",
    "since within distances of the order of one correlation length the @xmath81-system looks critical and so we may estimate probabilities using @xmath134 , the interpretation of  ( [ theta ] ) is that in order to percolate it is  sufficient \" to reach the boundary of the disc of radius @xmath128 ( measured in lattice units ) .",
    "we can also interpret  ( [ theta ] ) as meaning that the smallest ( in the sense of surrounding the smallest region ) white circuit @xmath135 ( i.e. , a self - avoiding circuit formed out of white hexagons ) around the origin that belongs to the infinite cluster is at distance of order @xmath128 ( measured in lattice units ) from the origin .",
    "therefore , in macroscopic units ( which are of order @xmath128 lattice units ) , @xmath135 stays at distance @xmath136 as @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , the choice of the exponent @xmath11 is such that @xmath135 neither approaches the origin nor recedes to infinity in the scaling limit .",
    "this implies that , after the scaling limit has been taken , there is a largest @xmath81-loop around the origin , whose outer envelope is at distance @xmath136 from the origin .",
    "therefore , as anticipated in the previous section , for any @xmath111 , the probability of the existence of a @xmath81-white path to infinity is strictly positive ( in fact equal to one ) , which means that @xmath118 is indeed the transition value for the continuum @xmath81-percolation model .    for any @xmath111",
    ", it is only within a distance @xmath136 of the origin that the continuum @xmath81-percolation model looks critical .",
    "in particular , the largest @xmath81-loop that surrounds the origin is the outer boundary of a @xmath81-black cluster and has ( the continuum limit of ) @xmath135 as its outer envelope ; the infinite @xmath81-white cluster has this largest @xmath81-loop about the origin as one of its inner boundaries . from @xmath135 , various `` dangling ends '' of the infinite cluster",
    "extend inside the critical scaling window coming closer to the origin .",
    "if we focus only inside a fixed window ( taken with free boundary conditions ) , some of those dangling ends get disconnected from each other and become separate clusters .",
    "these are typically among the largest clusters inside the critical scaling window , whose sizes are of order @xmath137 , as has been rigorously proved in  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we propose a construction of the scaling limit of the discrete minimal spanning tree ( mst ) , using our framework of continuum nonsimple loops and marked double points .",
    "the discrete mst is most easily defined on the square lattice , so in this section we focus on bond percolation on @xmath138 . for each nearest neighbor bond ( or edge ) @xmath42 , let @xmath139 be a uniform @xmath67 random variable with the @xmath139 s independent .",
    "this provides a standard coupling ( i.e. , realization on a single probability space ) of bond percolation models for all values @xmath7 of the probability that a bond @xmath42 is open by saying that @xmath42 is @xmath7-open if @xmath140 .",
    "one then defines the minimal spanning tree in , say , an @xmath141 square @xmath142 centered at the origin as the spanning tree in @xmath142 with the minimum value of @xmath143 summed over @xmath42 s in the tree .",
    "it is known , based on the relation to invasion percolation , that there is with probability one a single limiting tree as @xmath124  @xcite .",
    "we will denote this tree on the @xmath19-lattice , @xmath144 , by @xmath145 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to describe the putative scaling limit ( in distribution ) of @xmath145 as @xmath2 , in terms of our critical @xmath18-loop process and @xmath5-marked double points .",
    "our description uses a minimax construction in the continuum which is a natural analogue of a well - known one on the lattice ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we ignore differences between bond percolation on the square lattice and site percolation on the triangular lattice in the belief that they have no effect on the continuum scaling limit ; in particular we will use  white \" and  open \" interchangeably .    in the scaling limit",
    ", we may consider the continuum mst as the limiting set of paths within the tree ( see  @xcite for a general discussion of continuum scaling limits of trees ) . in order to define this tree ,",
    "it is enough to describe the ( unique , with probability one ) tree path between any two given deterministic points in @xmath146 .",
    "however , it will be more convenient to describe the continuum tree path between pairs of ( non - deterministic ) points , @xmath147 , such that each is contained in a continuum white cluster .",
    "since such points are dense in @xmath146 , one should obtain from these the paths between all pairs of points , including deterministic ones .    for this purpose",
    ", we will use the idea of @xmath5-connectivity introduced in section  [ connectivity ] .",
    "any two points @xmath147 contained in continuum white ( open ) clusters ( of the critical model ) are @xmath5-connected for some large enough value @xmath148 . to find the tree path between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we start decreasing @xmath5 from @xmath149 until it reaches a value @xmath88 below which @xmath109 and @xmath110 are not @xmath5-connected .",
    "@xmath88 is the smallest @xmath5 for which @xmath109 and @xmath110 are @xmath5-connected and furthermore @xmath88 is the value of a unique marked point @xmath150 on all @xmath88-paths from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "we then reduce @xmath5 below @xmath88 to a value @xmath151 below which either @xmath109 or @xmath110 is disconnected from @xmath150 .",
    "this will give us a new marked point @xmath152 labelled with a @xmath5 equal to @xmath151 .",
    "the procedure continues iteratively until the points @xmath153 fill in a continuous path between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the procedure outlined above is the continuum version of a standard minimax algorithm ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) to construct the minimal spanning tree on @xmath138 ( using uniform @xmath67 bond variables ) where one looks at the minimum over all paths from @xmath109 to @xmath110 of @xmath154 to get a particular bond , and then the procedure is repeated iteratively as above .",
    "we note that the minimax value of @xmath5 for the connection between points in two different white ( open ) clusters ( of the critical model ) will be positive , while the minimax value of @xmath5 for the connection between points in the same white ( open ) cluster will be negative .",
    "the minimal spanning tree path between two points in the same continuum white / open cluster is obtained by decreasing @xmath5 from @xmath18 towards @xmath155 , and the minimax points will be either double points of the counterclockwise @xmath18-loop surrounding the cluster or points in the interior of that counterclockwise @xmath18-loop where two clockwise daughter @xmath18-loops touch each other or points where one such daughter loop touches the original @xmath18-loop .",
    "we remark that we have presented our continuum minimax construction of the continuum mst in a relatively simple version that does not use any cutoffs ( like those discussed at the end of section  [ connectivity ] ) .",
    "even if such cutoffs turn out to be needed , the resulting construction should still be feasible within our framework of loops and marked double points .",
