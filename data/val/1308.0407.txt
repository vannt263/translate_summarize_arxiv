    "the primary tune - out wavelength for the @xmath1 ground state of neutral potassium located between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 excitations has recently measured to be 768.9712(15 ) nm @xcite .",
    "there have also been calculations of a number of tune - out wavelengths for potassium @xcite .",
    "the present work extends those calculations to take into consideration the impact of hyperfine interactions on the tune - out wavelengths for the @xmath0k isotopes .",
    "plans to measure tune - out wavelengths to increased precision mean that hyperfine splitting could easily become significant at the level of anticipated precision @xcite .",
    "the present article determines the impact of the hyperfine structure upon the tune - out wavelengths of potassium .",
    "we use the matrix elements previously used to determine the tune - out wavelengths of potassium @xcite and minimal details of this previous calculation are presented .",
    "the concept of the tune - out wavelength was initially introduced as a means to release one atom species from a two species optical lattice @xcite .",
    "other applications of tune - out wavelengths within two species optical lattices @xcite have recently been discussed .",
    "one of possible application would be the measurements of tune - out wavelengths to make precise estimates of oscillator strength ratios @xcite .",
    "a relative precision of about 0.2@xmath10 has been achieved in the @xmath11 transition matrix elements of rubidium @xcite and a relative precision of 0.19@xmath10 has been achieved for the @xmath12 line strength ratio for potassium @xcite .",
    "there are relatively few atomic oscillator strengths measured at this level of precision @xcite .",
    "the present investigation entails the determination of the polarizability of the k(@xmath13 ) ground state for different hyperfine levels .",
    "the calculations are similar to those used in the determination of the hyperfine stark shift and there have been a number of experiments and calculations on hyperfine stark shifts for the alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "the most important of these investigations are those related to the determination of the blackbody radiation shift of the @xmath14cs clock transition @xcite .",
    "the approach used to determine the influence of the hyperfine shift upon the dynamic polarizability is somewhat unorthodox .",
    "most calculations of the hyperfine stark shift are performed using third order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine interaction operator alters the polarizability in two distinctly different ways .",
    "first of all , the hyperfine energy shifts directly enter the denominator in the oscillator strength sum rule used to calculate the dipole polarizability .",
    "second , the hyperfine interactions leads to the mixing of the ground @xmath1 state with excited bound @xmath15 and continuum @xmath16 states .",
    "this results in a change of the @xmath17 line strengths .",
    "these two effects have roughly same influence on the polarizability .",
    "the approach used to calculate the hyperfine polarizabilities utilizes existing information about the hyperfine interaction constants to determine the hyperfine energy shifts of the low lying states of potassium .",
    "we do not use a perturbation theory calculation to determine the impact of the hyperfine interaction on the line strength .",
    "instead , the dipole matrix element from the resonant transition is treated as a parametric function of the binding energy , and matrix elements adjusted for the hyperfine energy shifts are used in the calculation of the polarizability .",
    "the method was validated by a comparison with the previous calculated and experimental hyperfine stark shifts for @xmath2k @xcite .",
    "shifts in the primary tune - out wavelengths for the ground states of @xmath0k were found to be very closely related to the hyperfine energy shifts of the ground states .",
    "the first part of our calculation required the determination of the hyperfine energy shifts of the ground and low - lying excited states .",
    "rather than calculate this information directly , the information is sourced from experiment or other calculations .",
    "the potassium dipole polarizability is dominated by the resonant transition , so hyperfine splitting is only taken into consideration for the ground state and some of the low - lying excited states .    according to first - order perturbation theory ,",
    "the energy for a hyperfine state @xmath18 is given @xcite by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy for the unperturbed fine structure state and @xmath21 is the hyperfine interaction energy .",
    "the hyperfine interaction energy can be written as @xmath22 where , @xmath23 @xmath24 is total angular momentum , @xmath25 is the nuclear spin , @xmath26 is the total electronic angular momentum of the associated fine structure state , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are hyperfine structure constants .",
    "it is usual to give the @xmath27 and @xmath28 coefficients in mhz where @xmath29 a.u .",
    "the energies of the different hyperfine states of @xmath2k , @xmath3k and @xmath4k are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the @xmath2k and @xmath4k isotopes are stable , while @xmath3k has a very long lifetime .",
    "the @xmath2k isotope is the most common at 93.3@xmath10 abundance .",
    "these tabulations are only include the @xmath1 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 states .",
    "the hyperfine energy shifts are largest for @xmath3k .",
    "the energy shifts for the @xmath1 ground states are about an order of magnitude larger than those of the @xmath8 excited states .",
    "similarly , the hyperfine splitting for the @xmath32 states are significantly larger than the splitting of the @xmath33 states .",
