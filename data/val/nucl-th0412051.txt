    "in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , a dense medium of quarks and gluons is expected to be produced and possibly a quark - gluon plasma is formed .",
    "one important step in establishing evidence of qgp formation is to charaterize the properties of the dense medium produced , for example , the parton and energy density and color confinement , among many other charateristics .",
    "conventionally , one can study the properties of a medium via scattering experiments with particle beams . in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis )",
    "experiments , for example , leptons scatter off the nucleon medium via photon exchange with quarks . the response function or the correlation function of the electromagnetic currents , @xmath1 is a direct measurement of the quark distributions in a nucleon or nucleus .",
    "such experiments have provided unprecedented information about partonic structure of nucleons and nucleus and confirmed the prediction of qcd evolution@xcite .",
    "for dynamic systems such as that produced in heavy - ion collisions , one can no longer use the technique of scattering with a beam of particles because of the transient nature of the matter .",
    "the lifetime of the system is very short , on the order of a few fm/@xmath2 .",
    "the initial spatial size is only the size of the heaviest nuclei , about 6 fm in diameter in the transverse dimension .",
    "the system expands very rapidly both in the longitudinal and transverse direction .",
    "these characteristics make it impossible to use external probes to study the properties of the produced dense matter in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "fortunately , one can prove that the thermal average of the above correlation function gives the photon emission rate from the evolving system .",
    "the emission rate depends mainly on the local temperature or the parton density while the total yield also depends the whole evolution history of the system .",
    "therefore , a strongly interacting system can reveal its properties and dynamics through photon and dilepton emission .",
    "one can further study the resonance properties of the emitted virtual photons and their medium modification .",
    "the screening of strong interaction in a color deconfined medium should lead to dissociation of the binding states and thus the quarkonia suppression @xcite .",
    "such color screening is a result of strong interaction between quarks and gluons at high density and temperature .",
    "the same interaction will also cause attenuation of fast and energetic partons propagating through the medium .",
    "such an effect is the underlying physics of the jet quenching @xcite phenomenon and jet tomography technique for studying properties of dense matter in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "jet quenching as a probe of the dense matter in heavy - ion collisions , takes advantage of the hard processes of jet production in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "similar to the technology of computed tomography ( ct ) , study of these energetic particles , their initial production and interaction with the dense medium , can yield critical information about the properties of the matter that is otherwise difficult to access through soft hadrons from the hadronization of the bulk medium .",
    "though relatively rare with small cross sections , the jet production rate can be calculated perturbative in qcd and agrees well with experimental measurements in high - energy @xmath3 collisions .",
    "a critical component of the jet tomography is then to understand the jet attenuation through dense matter as it propagates through the medium .",
    "a direct manifest of jet quenching is the modification of the fragmentation function of the produced parton , @xmath4 which can be measured directly .",
    "this modification can be directly translated into the energy loss of the leading parton .    to demonstrate medium modified fragmentation function and parton energy loss",
    ", one can study deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xmath5 @xcite . here , we consider the semi - inclusive processes , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the four - momenta of the incoming and the outgoing leptons , and @xmath9 is the observed hadron momentum .",

    "@xmath15 is the leptonic tensor while @xmath16 is the semi - inclusive hadronic tensor .    in the parton model with the collinear factorization approximation",
    ", the leading - twist contribution to the semi - inclusive cross section can be factorized into a product of parton distributions , parton fragmentation functions and the hard partonic cross section . including all leading log radiative corrections , the lowest order contribution from a single hard @xmath17 scattering",
    "can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hard part of the process in leading order , the momentum fraction carried by the hadron is defined as @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the bjorken variable .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the factorization scales for the initial quark distributions @xmath24 in a nucleus and the fragmentation functions @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "in a nuclear medium , the propagating quark in dis will experience additional scatterings with other partons from the nucleus .",
    "the rescatterings may induce additional gluon radiation and cause the leading quark to lose energy .",
    "such induced gluon radiations will effectively give rise to additional terms in the evolution equation leading to the modification of the fragmentation functions in a medium .",
    "these are the so - called higher - twist corrections since they involve higher - twist parton matrix elements and are power - suppressed .",
    "we will consider those contributions that involve two - parton correlations from two different nucleons inside the nucleus .",
    "one can apply the generalized factorization to these multiple scattering processes@xcite . in this approximation ,",

    ", we can relate the twist - four parton matrix elements of the nucleus to the twist - two parton distributions of nucleons and the nucleus , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is considered a constant .",
    "one can identify @xmath35 as the formation time of the emitted gluons . when it becomes comparable or larger than the nuclear size , the above matrix element vanishes , demonstrating a typical lpm interference effect .    since the lpm interference suppresses gluon radiation",

    "@xmath40 is the nucleon mass .",
    "therefore , the leading higher - twist contribution is proportional to @xmath41 due to double scattering and depends quadratically on the nuclear size @xmath42 .    with the assumption of the factorized form of the twist-4 nuclear parton matrices",
    ", there is only one free parameter @xmath43 which represents quark - gluon correlation strength inside nuclei .",

    "a remarkable feature of the prediction is the quadratic @xmath47 nuclear size dependence , which is verified for the first time by an experiment . by fitting the overall suppression for one nuclear target",
    ", we obtain the only parameter in our calculation , @xmath48 gev@xmath49 with @xmath50 at @xmath51 gev@xmath49 .",
    "the predicted @xmath52-dependence also agrees with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we can quantify the modification of the fragmentation by the quark energy loss which is defined as the momentum fraction carried by the radiated gluon , @xmath53 where @xmath54 if we choose the factorization scale as @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath56 we can estimate the leading quark energy loss roughly as @xmath57 since @xmath58 , the energy loss @xmath59 thus depends quadratically on the nuclear size .    in the rest frame of the nucleus , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",

    "this effective model is found to reproduce the pqcd result from eq.([eq : mdq ] ) very well , but only when @xmath88 is set to be @xmath89",
    ". therefore the actual averaged parton energy loss should be @xmath90 with @xmath91 extracted from the effective model .",
    "the factor 1.6 is mainly caused by the unitarity correction effect in the pqcd calculation .",
    "since gluons are bosons , there should also be stimulated gluon emission and absorption by the propagating parton because of the presence of thermal gluons in the hot medium .",
    "such detailed balance is crucial for parton thermalization and should also be important for calculating the energy loss of an energetic parton in a hot medium@xcite . taking into account such detailed balance in gluon emission , one can then get the asymptotic behavior of the effective energy loss in the opacity expansion framework @xcite , @xmath92\\nonumber \\\\     & & \\hspace{-0.3in}-     { { \\pi\\alpha_s c_f}\\over 3 } { { lt^2}\\over { \\lambda_g e^2 } }     \\left [     \\ln{{\\mu^2l}\\over t } -1+\\gamma_{\\rm e}-{{6\\zeta^\\prime(2)}\\over\\pi^2 } \\right ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is from the induced bremsstralung and the second term is due to gluon absorption in detailed balance which effectively reduce the total parton energy loss in the medium .",
    "numerical calculations show that the effect of the gluon absorption is small and can be neglected for partons with very high energy .",
    "however , the thermal absorption reduces the effective parton energy loss by about 30 - 10% for intermediate values of parton energy .",
    "this will increase the energy dependence of the effective parton energy loss in the intermediate energy region .",
    "one can parameterize such energy dependence as , @xmath93 the threshold is the consequence of gluon absorption that competes with radiation that effectively shuts off the energy loss .",
