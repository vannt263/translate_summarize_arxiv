    "the study of quantum information in noninertial framework is not only helpful for understanding some key questions in quantum mechanics @xcite , but it also plays an important role in the study of entropy and the information paradox of black holes @xcite . recently , much attention has been focused on the topic of the quantum information in a relativistic setting @xcite and , in particular , on how the unruh effect changes the degree of quantum entanglement @xcite and fidelity of teleportation @xcite .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that all investigations in noninertial frames are confined to the studies of the quantum information in _ an isolated system_. however , in a realistic quantum system , the _ interaction _ between the quantum system and the surrounding environment is inevitable , and then the dynamics of the system is non - unitary ( although the combined system plus environment evolves in a unitary fashion ) .",
    "the decoherence @xcite , which appears when a system interacts with its environment in a irreversible way , can be viewed as the transfer of information from system into the environment .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in the description of the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite and has been successfully applied in the cavity qed @xcite and ion trap experiments @xcite .    in this article",
    "we investigate the quantum decoherence of dirac fields in a noninertial system . for the sake of brevity and without loss of generality ,",
    "we consider only the amplitude damping channel @xcite , which is the most typical quantum noisy channel and can be modeled by the spontaneous decay of a two - level quantum state in an electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "we assume that two observers , alice and rob , share an entangled initial state at the same point in flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "after that alice stays stationary while rob moves with uniform acceleration .",
    "we let one ( or both ) of the observers moves ( or stays ) in the noisy environment and discuss whether or not the quantum decoherence and the loss of entanglement generated by unruh radiation will influence each other .",
    "a key question to be answered is : does r the entanglement appears to be sudden death @xcite or does it only disappears as time tends to infinity ?",
    "we assume that alice has a detector sensitive only to mode @xmath0 and rob has a detector sensitive only to mode @xmath1 , and they share the maximally entangled initial state @xmath2 at the same point in minkowski spacetime , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicate minkowski modes described by alice and rob , respectively .",
    "we then let alice remain stationary while rob moves with uniform acceleration .",
    "from the perspective of rob the minkowski vacuum is found to be a two - mode squeezed state @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is rob s acceleration , @xmath8 is frequency of the dirac particle , @xmath9 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate rindler modes in region @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ rindler ] ) , respectively .",
    "the only excited state is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that the concurrence is also @xmath39 for @xmath64 .",
    "( color online ) the concurrence as functions of the decay parameter @xmath65 and acceleration parameter @xmath48 [ @xmath41 ( black line ) ,  @xmath42 ( dotted line ) ,  @xmath43 ( dashed green line ) ,  @xmath44 ( dashed blue line ) ,  @xmath45 ( dashed orange line ) ] when both alice and rob s qubits under decoherence . ]",
    "figure ( [ erp2 ] ) shows time evolution of quantum entanglement when the total two qubits system is coupled to the environment .",
    "it shows that , compared with the case of only rob s qubit undergoing decoherence , the entanglement decreases more rapidly as the acceleration increases .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sudden death of entanglement appears at a finite time even for @xmath41 , and a lager acceleration also leads to an earlier appearance of the sudden death as the parameter @xmath65 increases .    in particular , when the acceleration approaches infinity , the sudden death appears when @xmath66 , whereas it happens when @xmath67 when only rob s qubit undergoes decoherence .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion that the decoherence and loss of entanglement generated by the unruh effect will influence each other in noninertial frames .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that , unlike the isolated case in which the entanglement of dirac fields survives even in the limit of infinite acceleration @xcite , the entanglement could tend to zero for finite acceleration in this system ; and a lager acceleration leads to an earlier disappearance of entanglement if either one or both subsystems experience a decoherence .",
    "thus , the decoherence and loss of entanglement generated by the unruh effect will influence each other remarkably in noninertial frames .",
    "it is also shown that the sudden death of entanglement will appear for any acceleration when both of the two qubits interact with the environment . however ,",
    "if only rob s qubit undergoes decoherence , the sudden death only takes place when the acceleration parameter is greater than the  critical point \" , @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "our results can be applied to the case in which alice moves along a geodesic while rob hovers near the event horizon with an uniform acceleration and one or both of them are in an amplitude - damping environment .",
