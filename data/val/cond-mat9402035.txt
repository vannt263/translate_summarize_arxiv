    "following the initial conjecture of haldane  @xcite it is by now well established both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite that integer spin antiferromagnetic chains have a gap as opposed to chains with half - integer spin .",
    "the spectrum is that of a disordered singlet ground - state with a gap , @xmath3 , to a triplet excitation . the disordered haldane phase is known to have a hidden order parameter , the so called string order parameter  @xcite .",
    "one of the best candidates for such a haldane gap system is ni(c@xmath4h@xmath5n@xmath4)@xmath4no@xmath4(clo@xmath6 ) ( nenp ) .",
    "the ratio of inter- to intra chain coupling in this compound is estimated  @xcite to be less than @xmath7 and no ordering has so far been observed at any accessible temperatures .",
    "nenp is not a completely isotropic compound .",
    "as revealed by neutron scattering experiments the magnon spectrum around wave vector @xmath8 is split into three branches  @xcite due to the effects of anisotropies .",
    "electron spin resonance studies  @xcite have observed transitions between the different components of the triplet confirming the expected nature of the spectrum .",
    "thus , the isotropic haldane gap , @xmath3 , is effectively split in three .",
    "single ion anisotropy , @xmath9 , splits the triplet into two modes for fluctuations perpendicular and parallel to the chain , respectively .",
    "in addition , in - plane anisotropy , of the form @xmath10 , splits the perpendicular mode by a small amount . at present the best estimates of the gaps in nenp",
    "@xcite are 2.50 , 1.25 , and 1.05 mev , respectively . the dispersion relation and dynamical structure factor",
    "have also been measured for nenp  @xcite .",
    "the largest of the anisotropies , and the only one we shall be concerned with here , is the single - ion anisotropy , @xmath11 .",
    "a simple hamiltonian capturing the essential physics including the single ion anisotropy is then @xmath12 as a function of @xmath11 the lowest lying gap will decrease . at a critical value @xmath13 the gap closes and a phase transition between the disordered haldane phase and a ",
    "large-@xmath11 \" phase occurs  @xcite . for a discussion of the phase diagram see ref .  .",
    "by fitting exact diagonalization results on chains of length up to 18 to inelastic neutron scattering results golinelli et al  @xcite have determined the optimal values @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 .",
    "this value of @xmath11 is then clearly in the disordered haldane phase . even including inter chain coupling , which changes the value of @xmath16 , @xmath15 remains in the disordered phase  @xcite , consistent with the fact that no ordering is observed in nenp at finite temperatures .",
    "recently it has been shown that the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) should be corrected to account for the staggered structure of the nenp chains  @xcite , a fact that also leads to a staggered off - diagonal part in the gyromagnetic tensor  @xcite .",
    "the longest chains one has studied by exact diagonalization have 18 sites  @xcite .",
    "while it is possible to study somewhat longer chains using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques  @xcite the statistical errors on these results will limit the detailed interpretation of the data .",
    "recently white  @xcite has proposed a density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method that allows one to study significantly longer chains with much higher accuracy than what is obtainable using qmc methods . at present it",
    "is not known how to work with the momentum as a quantum number within the dmrg framework although this would be very desirable and one is therefore restricted to study quantities defined in real space .",
    "another less important restriction imposed by the dmrg is the fact that it works notably better for chains with open ends .",
    "recent progress  @xcite indicates that open ended systems can be tuned to mimic the behavior of systems subject to periodic boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we calculate equal time correlation functions in real space for the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic chain for systems of up to 100 spins using the dmrg method .",
    "the numerical results are then compared to predictions obtained from the nonlinear sigma ( nl@xmath17 ) model and a free boson model .",
    "some of our results have previously been presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "equal time correlation functions have been calculated by qmc techniques  @xcite and by exact diagonalization  @xcite for chains of length up to l=18 .",
    "the lowest energy excitation as a function of momentum has been calculated by qmc techniques  @xcite and by exact diagonalization  @xcite for chains of length up to l=18 .",
    "the dynamic structure factor has been studied by qmc techniques  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical structure factor , including anisotropy , for both in plane and out of plane modes has been studied by golinelli et . al  @xcite using exact diagonalization on chains with @xmath18 , and by haas et .",
    "@xcite for the out of plane mode with @xmath19 .",
    "while generally applicable the current state of the art exact diagonalization studies are limited by the fact that only very short chains can be studied , thus restricting the accessible momentum values considerably .",
    "secondly , finite size effects are likely to be large .",
    "the finite size effects can be improved upon by the application of extrapolation techniques , ( shanks transformations ) , if enough data points are available .",
    "thus , values for the gaps can be extracted to a very good precision .",
    "however , for the structure factor , this technique can only be applied for a few values of the momentum .",
    "the qmc results , while applicable to considerably longer chains , have statistical errors .",
    "the extraction of dynamical properties from qmc results requires the analytical continuation of results obtained at imaginary frequencies to real frequencies .",
    "this is typically done using maximum entropy methods and is not a trivial matter . while dynamical properties are not accessible yet using the dmrg method , it is possible to obtain equal time correlations for very long chains with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "this huge gain in detail and precision allows a detailed comparison to field theory and experiment not previously possible .",

    "the bulk of the calculations of the correlation functions presented here will be for a 100 site chain in the @xmath23 state since this system conceptually is the simplest .",
    "we have repeated the calculations for the @xmath22 state and also performed the same calculations for a 60 site system . in none of these cases were the correlation functions seen to differ markedly from what we will describe below , aside from boundary effects . in particular , all the correlation lengths obtained were consistent .",
    "we implement the dmrg using density matrices of the size @xmath24 keeping 81 eigenvectors of these matrices at each iteration .",
    "first density matrices representing systems of different sizes are computed using an infinite lattice method , then these are combined to form a system of a fixed size , l=100 , for which all the correlation functions are calculated using a finite lattice method  @xcite .",
    "for a discussion of the numerical procedure we refer the reader to ref .  .",
    "the dmrg method for open chains leaves two good quantum numbers the total @xmath25 component , @xmath26 , and the parity , @xmath27 , corresponding to a reflection about the midpoint of the chain .",
    "these are conserved under iteration and it is therefore possible to work within a subspace defined by these two quantum numbers . in the following",
    "we characterize states solely by these two quantum numbers : the total @xmath25 component , @xmath26 , and the parity , @xmath27 .",
    "an additional symmetry , corresponding to a global spin flip interchanging -1 and 1 while leaving 0 alone , introduces another parity in the @xmath28 sector .",

    "we therefore here recapitulate our main findings with error - bars we believe are close to reality but more or less phenomenologically obtained by judging the variation of the various parameters between different fits .",
    "@xmath384 here all the results were obtained for an anisotropic chain with @xmath15 .",
    "the bulk correlation functions show evidence of a small but non zero uniform part .",
    "close to @xmath285 the equal time structure factor is very well described by a square root lorentzian .",
    "the equal time structure factor @xmath282 does in this case no longer approach 0 as @xmath385 . in this region both @xmath281 and @xmath282 are well described by a two magnon contribution to the structure factor calculated within the free boson theory .",
    "the agreement between the free boson theory and the numerical results is however only qualitative and judging from the comparison between a single mode approximation and the experimental data it seems likely that a single mode persist all the way to @xmath377 . by comparing the single mode approximation to exact diagonalization results",
    "it is seen that between @xmath286 and @xmath377 the continuous part of the spectrum should become dominant .    for the isotropic chain , with @xmath21 , we find  @xcite @xmath386 also in this case we find evidence for a small but non zero uniform part of the bulk correlation functions .",
    "close to @xmath285 the equal time structure factor is very well described by a square root lorentzian . in the region close to @xmath286",
    "the equal time structure factor can be compared to an exact result obtained from the nl@xmath17 model for the two magnon contribution to the structure factor .",
    "an excellent agreement between theory and the numerical data is seen out to fairly large values of @xmath90 .",
    "this seems consistent with the behavior of the spectrum . here",
    "the single mode approximation as compared to quantum monte carlo results indicates the onset of a continuous part earlier than for the anisotropic chain .    from the results presented here it seems likely that a contribution to the structure factor , near @xmath286 , from two magnon excitations should be observable in nenp since @xmath387 is non zero . experimentally no indication of this has been observed so far .",
    "regnault et al  @xcite have performed neutron scattering experiments near @xmath286 and find no indication of a nonvanishing structure factor at @xmath286 .",
    "ma et al  @xcite analyze their ins data obtained in the range @xmath388 solely in terms of a single mode and do not observe the expected two magnon continuum .",
    "these authors point out that the free boson two - magnon prediction for @xmath389 , when convoluted with the experimental resolution function , yields a much broader peak than what is observed experimentally , at the smallest value of @xmath90 studied experimentally , @xmath390 , although the integrated intensity is roughly correct . in fig .",
    "[ fig : s03 ] we compare the _ unconvoluted _ free boson two - magnon prediction at @xmath391 with the experimental result .",
    "note that the integrated intensity and location of the intensity maximum are approximately correct .",
    "also note that the width of the theoretical curve is about 2 mev whereas the experimental width , of about 1 mev , appears to be resolution limited . under these circumstances ,",
    "the possibility that the experimentally observed peak is of two - magnon type , with a width somewhat reduced by interaction effects , can not be ruled out .",
    "including interaction effects in the nl@xmath17 model does lead to a narrowing of the two - magnon peak as shown in ref .",
    ".    the much larger width of the free boson prediction , of about 5 mev , shown in ref .  , fig .",
    "( 1c ) , is primarily a consequence of convolution with the experimental resolution function .",
    "although this resolution is very narrow in frequency , it is rather broad in wave - vector , @xmath392 .",
    "the relatively narrow convoluted width of about @xmath393 mev , was obtained in the experiment by tilting the resolution ellipsoid so its axis was approximately parallel to the dispersion curve . under these circumstances ,",
    "the result of convoluting any theoretical prediction with the resolution function is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the theoretical dispersion relation ( ie .",
    "the peak center vs. @xmath90 ) .",
    "it is clear from figure 18 that the relativistic two - boson dispersion curve starts to fail badly for @xmath394 . hence convoluting this function with a resolution function of width @xmath395 produces an enormous width in frequency",
    "this is especially so since the intensity increases rapidly with @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the very broad resolution of the experiment prevents a definitive test of the theoretical model . the extremely good agreement with the nl@xmath17 model two - magnon prediction for @xmath274 shown here , and the shifting of spectral weight above the lowest state , shown for @xmath19 in refs",
    ".   suggest that the excitations may start to exhibit a two - particle character at around @xmath396 .",
    "further experimental work with higher resolution and lower @xmath90 will be needed to settle this question .",
