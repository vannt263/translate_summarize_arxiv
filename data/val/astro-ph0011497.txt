    "studies of individual stars and resolved stellar populations are fundamental for a wide variety of astrophysical subjects . in most cases",
    "photometric observations , obtained in various systems , represent the main observable . to translate these observables into fundamental stellar parameters ( mainly effective temperature , luminosity ) one first has to rely on stellar atmosphere models . in a second step",
    "the observations can then be compared to stellar evolution models and interpreted in physical terms such as mass , age , composition etc . only in rare cases ( very low mass stars , baraffe  1995 ; o stars , schaerer  1996 ) stellar evolution and atmosphere models",
    "are coupled and predict thus directly observables such as colors , magnitudes etc .",
    "extensive grids of stellar tracks covering the most important evolutionary phases and a large metallicity range have become available in the nineties ( see e.g.  compilation in leitherer 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , recent efforts have been undertaken to provide accurate synthetic colours from grids of atmosphere models covering the bulk of the parameter space occupied by observed stars of spectral types from o to m and all luminosity classes ( lejeune   1997 , 1998 , bessell  1998 ) . with the availability of such data",
    "it now becomes feasible to systematically convert stellar tracks of all stellar masses and derived isochrones to a variety of photometric systems .",
    "to provide such a tool is the main goal of our database .",
    "existing grids , partly fulfilling this aim , include the library of padova isochrones with ubvrijhk photometry for ages @xmath3 4 myr  20 gyr and metallicities @xmath0 between 0.0004 and 0.05 ( bertelli  1994 , girardi  1996 ) , the recent @xmath4-element enhanced tracks and isochrones of salasnich  ( 2000 ) with ubvrijhk and hst - wfpc2 photometry , and various other calculations covering smaller fractions of the parameter space .    for the present work we rely on an updated version of the hybrid library of synthetic stellar spectra compiled by lejeune  ( 1997 , 1998 ) , which is corrected to match empirical colour  temperature relations at solar metallicity and semi - empirically corrected at other metallicities .",
    "these atmosphere models are used to derive synthetic photometry of the , wfpc2 , geneva , and washington systems , using proper reference spectra for the zero points and up - to - date filter curves .",
    "this procedure is applied to essentially the full set of geneva stellar evolution models to yield the photometric data for these systems for _ 1 ) _ individual stellar tracks in the mass range from 0.40.8 to 120150 and metallicities @xmath0=0.0004 ( 1/50 ) to 0.1 ( 5 ) , and _ 2 ) _ corresponding isochrones covering ages from @xmath3 0 to 1620 gyr .",
    "the input tracks , atmosphere models , and the synthetic photometry are described in sect .  2 .",
    "the resulting database products ( tracks and isochrones ) are presented in sect .",
    "3 . concluding remarks on the use of the various database sets are given in section 4 .",
    "the appendix includes the relevant data for a previously unpublished set of stellar tracks at @xmath0=0.0004 .",
    "the current compilation includes all grids of geneva stellar evolution models published between 1992 and march 1999 in papers i  viii ( see footnote of table [ tab_grids ] for complete references ) and a new grid of stellar models for very low metallicity ( z=1/50 , see appendix ) .",

    "the present compilation includes stellar models covering a very large parameter space in terms of mass , metallicity , and evolutionary phases .",
    "however , we wish to stress again that e.g.  the following evolutionary phases are not covered : 1 ) pre - main sequence tracks ( for geneva models see bernasconi 1996 and paper viii ) , 2 ) thermally pulsing agb stars , and 3 ) post - agb stars and white dwarfs . other phases ( e.g. horizontal branch ) are given only for a subset of metallicities .",

    "the conversion of the theoretical tracks and isochrones of the present compilation to observational colour - magnitude ( c - m ) diagrams has been performed using the stellar spectral library of lejeune   ( 1997 , 1998 ) that provides empirically and semi - empirically _ colour - calibrated _ model atmosphere spectra for a large range of fundamental stellar parameters , @xmath36 ( 2000 k to 50,000 k ) , @xmath37 ( -1.0 to 5.5 ) , and ( 5.0 to + 1.0 ) .    for the present calculations , we use the most recent version of this library (",
    "westera  1999 ) , -2.2 , in which ( 1 ) all the model spectra of stars with @xmath38 k are now calibrated upon empirical colours from the @xmath39 _ versus _",
    "@xmath40 relation of flower ( 1996 ) , and ( 2 ) the calibration procedure for the cool giant model spectra has been extended to the parameter ranges 2500 k @xmath41 @xmath42 6000 k and -1.0 @xmath41 @xmath42 3.5 , with in particular the effect to provide redder model colours for giants , in better agreement with observed red giant branches of metal - poor globular clusters ( see lejeune & buser 1999 ) .      in order to transform the theoretical quantities ( @xmath43 ) into magnitudes and colours , we first compute , by interpolation in the  grid ( , , and tracks . for other metallicities",

    "the wolf - rayet phases in the stellar tracks are excluded from this interpolation procedure because no physical model is available in the grid to accurately describe the atmosphere and the spectra of stars in these phases . for these reasons , in the files we assign an arbitrary value ( @xmath46 ) to the magnitudes and the colours corresponding to these points .",
    "it has also to be pointed out that , because of some missing models in the set of models near @xmath47 k and @xmath48 , extrapolations in @xmath49 are necessary to compute the colours in this parameter range , leading to a few numerical approximations . as a consequence ,",
    "the derived magnitudes and colours change more abruptly with @xmath39 than expected , and hence the shape of the stellar tracks do not appear very smooth in this region of the c - m diagram . for these peculiar points ,",
    "we estimate our computed photometry to be accurate to about @xmath50 mag .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are computed from the absolute luminosity given in the tracks and the bolometric corrections computed from stellar atmosphere models . for _",
    "all _ the photometric systems described in the following sections , we give the absolute magnitude , @xmath51 , expressed in the johnson band .",
    "absolute magnitudes in the other passbands can then be derived from the colour indices provided in the files .",
    "our adopted bolometric correction scale is that described in lejeune   ( 1998 ) , defined in such a way to fit the empirical scale of flower ( 1996 ) instead of using the unique calibration point of the sun .",
    "note that with this definition , we find @xmath52 for the solar model of kurucz ( 1992 ) , a value slightly different of that usually quoted for the sun .",
    "the zero - points of the colours are defined from the vega model spectrum of kurucz ( 1992 ) ; for the , the , and the hst - wfpc2 photometric systems , the computed colours for this model are set to zero , while for the geneva system these values are adjusted on the observed photometry of vega , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( rufener 1976 ) , and @xmath59 band , the geneva @xmath60 is noted with an asterisk hereafter . ]",
    "[ [ ubvetc_photom ] ]    for the johnson - cousins - glass photometry , we used the filter response functions of buser ( 1978 ) for @xmath61 , bessell ( 1979 ) for @xmath62 , and bessell & brett ( 1988 ) for @xmath63 .",
    "hst - wfpc2 synthetic photometry has been computed from the passbands described in the `` _ wfpc2 instrument handbook _ '' .",
    "we used the function responses from may 1998 which include the effects of all the detection chain ( filter transmission , ccd quantum efficiency , etc . ) , hence allowing direct comparisons of our synthetic c - m diagrams with hst data .",
    "the wfpc2 zero - points are usually defined on the @xmath64 system , based on a _ constant - flux - density - per - unit - wavelength_. the conversion between the @xmath65 system ( based on the vega s spectrum ) and the @xmath64 system is given by the following formula : @xmath66 which , with our passband definitions and the vega model spectrum of kurucz , give the colour differences , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for f336w - f439w , f439w - f555w , f555w - f675w , and f675w - f814w respectively .",

    "differences with the passband functions previoulsy published by nicolet ( 1996 ) are very small , and do not exceed a few percents on the computed colours . in order to test the accuracy of our computed synthetic photometry , we made some comparisons with observed data for a sample of dwarf stars with @xmath78 to @xmath79 from the rufener ( 1988 ) catalogue .",
    "the results have shown a good or very good agreement with the observations for most of the colour indices , with most of the colour diferences 0.05 mag .",

    "isochrones are provided for timesteps of @xmath126 for ages above 1 myr ( @xmath127 ) . for younger ages isochrones",
    "are available for @xmath128 3.0 , 5.0 , 5.3 , 5.6 , 5.8 , and 5.9 yr .    the isochrones are grouped in files named according to the following conventions : iso_izzz_ffff_tttt.ext , where i stands for the database i d ( col .",

    "the content of the files is the same as for the stellar tracks described above , with the following exceptions : column 1 is replaced by a line number , and column 2 now gives the initial mass along the isochrone .      in figure",
    "[ plot_cmd ] , we give an illustration of some synthetic c ",

    "0.0004 , 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , 0.04 , and 0.1 ) . the peculiar behaviour of the @xmath132 isochrone is due to the overluminosity and the hotter temperature of these very metal - rich stars discussed in detail in mowlavi et al .",
    "( 1998ab ) .",
    "the data will be accessible through the cds and on the web page http://webast.ast.obs - mip.fr / stellar/. future updates of the database , including e.g.  additional photometric systems , are foreseen through the latter site .",
    "we now briefly indicate the most appropriate set of models for the cases where several choices are offered .    for most purposes the `` basic model set '' ( files with",
    "the i d `` c '' ) should be appropriate .",
    "the tracks of this set have e.g.  been applied to analysis of galactic open clusters with ages @xmath3 4 myr  9.5 gyr by meynet  ( 1993 ) .    for analysis of massive stars ( @xmath133 ) the high mass loss models ( i d : `` e '' )",
    "should preferrentially be used ( see maeder & meynet 1994 ) .    for studies of low mass stars ( @xmath134 0.4  2.5 ) the combined model set ( i d :",
    "`` l '' ) at z=0.001 and z=0.02 should be most appropriate since it includes the mhd equation of state for @xmath135 1  and covers also the post - helium flash evolutionary phases of stars with masses 0.8 @xmath136 1.7 .    for studies limited to the lowest masses ( @xmath137 1 ) the `` m '' set should be preferred .    for studies critical to the properties of stars in the mass range 1",
    " 1.5 , corresponding to the appearance of core convection on the main sequence , the `` o '' sets allow in comparison with the basic sets ( `` c '' ) to study the effect of enhanced convective cores ( overshooting ) in this mass range .    as mentioned earlier , the geneva stellar grids used in this work do not include thermally pulsing agb stars and post - agb phases , such as central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) and white dwarfs ( wd ) . if necessary the present data must be complemented with existing calculations from the literature .",
    "for recent calculations of agb stars we refer e.g.  to the complete or combined complete + synthetic models of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) , blcker ( 1995a ) , forestini & charbonnel ( 1997 ) , and langer  ( 1999 ) , and to the synthetic models of van den hoeck & groenewegen ( 1997 ) and marigo  ( 1998 ) .",
    "recent models of cspn and wd are given by e.g.  blcker ( 1995b ) driebe  ( 1998 ) , and hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) .",
    "a new grid of stellar models at very low metallicity ( 1/50 solar ) has been calculated by one of us for various applications ( see de mello  1998 , stasiska & schaerer 1999 ) .",
    "the full grid of stellar tracks from 0.8 to 150  is briefly summarised here .",
    "the input physics is identical to that of meynet  ( 1994 , paper v ) .",
    "this includes in particular the adoption of `` high '' mass loss rates , i.e.  @xmath138 /yr for wnl stars and twice the mass loss rates of de jager  ( 1988 ) for stars with @xmath139 .",
    "otherwise we follow the prescription of paper i. for consistence with the earlier grids the initial composition is calculated as in paper i : x=0.7584 , y=0.2412 , z=0.0004 .",
    "the hrd with the calculated tracks is shown in fig.a1 hatched areas indicate regions of slow nuclear burning phases .",
    "the h , he , and c burning lifetimes are given in table [ ta_lifetime ] .",
    "due to numerical instabilities the 85  model could not be fully evolved to the end of he burning .",
    "the remaining he - burning lifetime as well as the duration of c - burning were estimated by interpolation between the two adjacent tracks . for similar reasons @xmath140 of the 20  model had also to be estimated .",
    "the mass limit for the formation of wr stars , @xmath141 , at z=0.0004 from the present tracks is @xmath142 85 , as already derived in de mello  ( 1998 ) .",
