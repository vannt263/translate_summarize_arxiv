    "unpolarized parton distributions in the nucleon are now well determined in the region from very small @xmath4 to large @xmath4 by using various experimental data .",
    "there are abundant data on electron and muon deep inelastic scattering .",
    "in addition , there are available data from neutrino reactions , drell - yan processes , @xmath6 productions , direct photon productions , and others .",
    "the optimum parton distributions are determined so as to fit these experimental data .",
    "initial distributions are assumed at a fixed @xmath1 with parameters , which are determined by a @xmath3 analysis .",
    "now , there are three major groups , cteq ( coordinated theoretical / experimental project on qcd phenomenology and tests of the standard model ) @xcite , grv ( glck , reya , and vogt ) @xcite , and mrs ( martin , roberts , and stirling ) @xcite , which have been investigating the unpolarized parametrization .",
    "because the distributions themselves are associated with nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , they can not be described precisely by theoretical methods at this stage .",
    "therefore , the determination enables us to understand internal structure of the nucleon , hence to test the nonperturbative hadron models .",
    "in addition , the parton distributions are always necessary for calculating cross sections of high - energy reactions involving a nucleon .",
    "furthermore , there is other importance in determining future physics direction .",
    "if the distributions are precisely known , any experimental deviation from theoretical predictions should indicate new physics beyond the standard model , for example a signature of subquark system .",
    "the situation is worse in polarized distributions .",
    "longitudinally polarized distributions have been investigated in the last decade . from the analyses of many polarized electron and muon deep inelastic experimental data ,",
    "several parametrizations have been proposed .",
    "neutrino , drell - yan , and other data are not available unlike the unpolarized studies , so that antiquark and gluon distributions can not be determined accurately at this stage @xcite .",
    "more precise determination should be done by the polarized relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) experiments in the near future .",
    "it is well known that nuclear parton distributions are modified from the corresponding ones in the nucleon according to the measurements of nuclear @xmath7 structure functions @xcite . because @xmath7 is expected to be dominated by sea- and valence - quark distributions at small and large @xmath4 , respectively , the modification of each distribution should be determined by the @xmath7 measurements in the small or large @xmath4 region .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to find the detailed @xmath4 dependence of these distributions . furthermore , it is also not obvious how nuclear gluon distributions are constrained by the @xmath7 data .",
    "there are trials to obtain the distributions from the data in a model dependent way @xcite and in a model independent way by eskola , kolhinen , and ruuskanen @xcite ; however , they are not @xmath3 analyses .",
    "therefore , this paper is intended to pioneer the @xmath3 analysis study for obtaining optimum nuclear parton distributions @xcite .",
    "there are following motivations for investigating the nuclear parametrization .",
    "the first purpose is to test various nuclear models for describing the nuclear structure functions . from the detailed comparison",
    ", the most appropriate nuclear model could be determined in the high - energy region .",
    "furthermore , we may be able to find an explicit subnucleon signature in nuclear physics .",
    "the second purpose is to calculate cross sections of high - energy nuclear reactions accurately .",
    "for example , precise initial conditions must be known in heavy - ion reactions for finding a signature of quark - gluon plasma . in many calculations , nuclear parton distributions",
    "are simply assumed to be the same as the corresponding ones in the nucleon .",
    "the third purpose is related to the aforementioned nucleon parametrization . in obtaining parton distributions in the  nucleon \" , some  nuclear \"",
    "data are actually used without considering the nuclear modification .",
    "for example , neutrino @xmath8 data are essential for determining the valence - quark distributions in the nucleon .",
    "however , most data are taken for the iron target ! in future , accurate neutrino - proton scattering data could be taken if a neutrino factory is realized @xcite .",
    "it is inevitable to utilize the nuclear data at this stage .",
    "therefore , our nuclear studies should be useful for improving the present parametrizations in the nucleon .",
    "this paper consists of the following .",
    "first , dependence of the mass number @xmath9 and scaling variable @xmath4 is discussed in [ ax - depend ] .",
    "then , our analysis method is explained in [ method ] , and results are presented in [ results ] .",
    "obtained distributions are provided in sec .",
    "[ usage ] for practical usage .",
    "finally , our nuclear parametrization studies are summarized in section [ sum ] .",
    "because there is no prior @xmath3 analysis on the nuclear parametrization , we should inevitably take the @xmath9 and @xmath4 dependence as simple as possible for the first step trial .",
    "however , the functional form of @xmath4 should be taken independently from any theoretical nuclear models as a fair analysis .",
    "our standpoint is to test the models without relying on them .",
    "we discuss an appropriate functional form of the distributions in the following subsections .",
    "there is some consensus on physics mechanism of nuclear modification in each @xmath4 region .",
    "because different mechanisms contribute to the modification depending on the @xmath4 region , the @xmath9 dependence could vary in different @xmath4 regions .",
    "however , in order to simplify the analysis , we introduce a rather bold assumption : the @xmath9 dependence is assumed to be proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "physics behind this idea is discussed by day and sick in ref .",
    "@xcite . in any nuclear reaction",
    ", the cross section is expressed in terms of nuclear volume and surface contributions : @xmath11 therefore , the cross section per nucleon is given as @xmath12 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend weakly on @xmath9 , the @xmath10 dependence makes sense as the leading approximation .",
    "in fact , according to the measured @xmath15 data , this @xmath9 dependence is justified @xcite .",
    "dependence of measured @xmath15 ratios at @xmath16.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    in order to illustrate the justification , we show actual @xmath15 data as a function of @xmath17 at @xmath16 together with a straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig : adep ] .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that measured ratios are well reproduced by the line with the @xmath17 dependence .",
    "we also looked at other regions , for example , the small @xmath4 region and found that the data could be described by this @xmath9 dependence . in this way",
    ", we decided to employ this simple assumption .",
    "of course , the @xmath10 dependence may be an oversimplification .",
    "detailed studies of the @xmath9 dependence are left as a future research topic .",
    "we should mention , however , that the exact @xmath17 dependence is not completely consistent with the conditions of nuclear charge , baryon number , and momentum .",
    "we need to assign fine - tuning parameters which adjust the nuclear dependence .",
    "the details will be explained in the next subsection below eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wi - withh ] ) .",
    "available nuclear data on the structure function @xmath18 are taken in fixed - target experiments at this stage , and they are shown as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy transfer , @xmath21 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath1 is given by @xmath22 with the virtual photon momentum @xmath23 .",
    "the initial nuclear parton distributions are provided at a fixed @xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) , and they are taken as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the parton distribution with type @xmath27 in the nucleus @xmath9 and @xmath28 is the corresponding parton distribution in the nucleon .",
    "we call @xmath29 a weight function , which takes into account the nuclear modification .",
    "we lose a piece of information by using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : apart ] ) .",
    "a scaling variable for the lepton - nucleus scattering could be given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the momentum of the target nucleus .",
    "we could define another variable for lepton - nucleon scattering as @xmath32 with the nucleon momentum @xmath33 within the nucleus .",
    "the variable @xmath34 indicates the momentum fraction of a struck - quark in the nucleus and it is kinematically restricted as @xmath35 .",
    "because of these definitions , we have the relation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the nuclear mass , in a fixed target reaction . in this way",
    ", we find that the range of nuclear parton distributions is given by @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the extremely large @xmath4 region ( @xmath39 ) can not be described in our present approach with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : apart ] ) because the distributions in the nucleon vanish : @xmath40 .",
    "there are following reasons for using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : apart ] ) irrespective of this issue .",
    "first , there are not so many experimental data in this @xmath4 region .",
    "second , even if finite parton distributions are assumed at the initial point @xmath41 , there is no reliable theoretical tool to evolve them to larger @xmath1 points where the data exist .",
    "therefore , such large @xmath4 distributions can not be accommodated in our @xmath3 analysis .",
    "there is a nuclear @xmath1 evolution code in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , the original evolution equations are written in the range @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "third , because the nuclear modification is generally in the 10@xmath4330% range for medium and large size nuclei , it is much easier to investigate the modification from the distributions in the nucleon rather than the absolute nuclear distributions themselves .",
    "forth , the structure functions @xmath18 or parton distributions are tiny at @xmath39 , so that they do not affect the calculated cross sections significantly unless an extreme kinematical condition is chosen .",
    "now , we proceed to the actual @xmath4 dependence .    *",
    "( 1 ) nuclear modification @xmath44 @xmath45 *    as concluded in the previous subsection , the nuclear modification part of @xmath46 is assumed to be proportional to @xmath17 : @xmath47    * ( 2 ) introduction of @xmath48 factor *    the nuclear parton distributions have finite values even at @xmath49 in principle , so that the weight function should behave as @xmath50 this equation should hold whatever the modification mechanism is . in order to reproduce this feature ,",
    "the factor @xmath51 is introduced in the @xmath4 dependent function part of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wia ] ) with a parameter @xmath52 : @xmath53    * ( 3 ) saturation of shadowing or antishadowing *    we assume saturation of the function @xmath29 at @xmath54 .",
    "it is considered to be a reasonable assumption unless there is a peculiar mechanism to produce singular behavior at small @xmath4 .",
    "as far as the experimental @xmath15 data suggest , the shadowing at small @xmath4 tends to saturate as @xmath55 .",
    "if this saturation is assumed , the weight function @xmath56 becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the parameter which controls shadowing or antishadowing magnitude .    from these discussions ,",
    "an appropriate functional form becomes @xmath59 where the additional @xmath4 dependent part is written as @xmath60 , and it determines minute @xmath4 dependent shape .",
    "the reason why we let the parameters @xmath58 depend on @xmath9 and @xmath61 is the following . as explained in the next section , there are three obvious constraints , charge , baryon number , and total momentum , on the nuclear distributions . if these conditions are satisfied for a nucleus , they are also fulfilled for other nuclei with the same @xmath62 ratio . for example , the conditions could be satisfied for all the isoscalar nuclei .",
    "however , we also analyze nuclei with different @xmath62 ratios .",
    "then , even if the three conditions are satisfied in a certain nucleus , they are not strictly fulfilled for other nuclei with different @xmath62 factors . in order to avoid this kind of failure , nuclear dependence",
    "is assumed for the parameters @xmath58 in the valence - quark and gluon functions .",
    "they are determined by the @xmath3 analysis so as to satisfy the three conditions for any nucleus .",
    "because this is the first @xmath3 trial , we would like to simplify the functional form of @xmath60 as much as possible .",
    "a simple idea is to expand it in a polynomial form @xmath63 .",
    "an advantage of this functional form is that the polynomials of @xmath4 and @xmath64 are very easy to be handled in the mellin - transformation method of the @xmath1 evolution .",
    "because a direct @xmath4-space solution @xcite is used in our @xmath1 evolution , it does not matter in our present analysis .",
    "however , it is important for public usage if we consider the fact that many researchers use the mellin transformation as their @xmath1 evolution method .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath65 can not explain the complicated @xmath15 shape in the medium @xmath4 region .",
    "therefore , the simplest yet realistic choice is to take @xmath66 .",
    "this seems to be acceptable in the sense that the medium @xmath4 depletion of @xmath15 can be explained together with the @xmath18 shadowing at small @xmath4 .",
    "however , if the depletion is described by the valence - quark behavior as our common sense suggests , the valence - quark distributions show anti - shadowing at small @xmath4 due to the baryon - number conservation . as explained in refs.@xcite , it is not obvious at this stage whether the valence distributions indicate shadowing or antishadowing without accurate neutrino - deuteron scattering data and also small @xmath4 nuclear data .",
    "therefore , this functional form should be considered as one of possible options : @xmath67 we call this weight function the quadratic type in the following discussions .",
    "if the next polynomial term @xmath68 is added in addition , the function becomes more flexible in fitting the data : @xmath69 we call this weight function the cubic type .",
    "an advantage of the additional term is , for example , that the weight function becomes flexible enough to accommodate both possibilities , shadowing and anti - shadowing , in the valence - quark distributions .",
    "a disadvantage is that the number of total parameters becomes larger , so that the total computing time becomes longer .",
    "these quadratic and cubic functional types are used in our @xmath3 analyses . finding the optimum point for the parametrization set",
    ", we expect to explain the major features of the measured @xmath15 ratios .",
    "in addition to the initial functional form , there are other important factors for performing the @xmath3 analysis . in this section ,",
    "the details are discussed on used experimental data and our @xmath3 analysis method .",
    "there are many available experimental data which could indicate nuclear parton distributions .",
    "however , we restrict the data to those taken by the deep inelastic electron and muon scattering .",
    "neutrino , drell - yan , and other hadron - collider data are not used in our present analysis with the following reasons . at first",
    ", we would like to investigate how the distributions are determined solely by the electron and muon scattering data .",
    "next , as it is mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , nuclear modification of @xmath8 is not measured in the neutrino scattering . in hadron - hadron reactions",
