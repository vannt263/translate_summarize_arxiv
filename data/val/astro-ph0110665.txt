    "the magellanic clouds , which are the largest nearby galaxies , provide our most detailed view of the extragalactic universe .",
    "although their proximity is generally an advantage , their large angular extent on the sky has hampered global studies .",
    "historically , stellar catalogs of the clouds have relied on photographic data ( see @xcite and @xcite for some of the most recent examples ) . within the last decade , several large - scale digital surveys of the magellanic clouds have been undertaken . in the optical bands , the principal ones are the microlensing surveys ( macho , @xcite ; ogle , @xcite ; and eros , @xcite ) , an emission line survey ( @xcite ) , a bright star survey ( @xcite ) , the red optical channel ( @xmath3 ) of the infrared denis survey ( @xcite ) , and our magellanic clouds photometric survey , hereafter mcps ( @xcite ) .",
    "we present the stellar photometric data in catalog form from the mcps for the entire small magellanic cloud ( smc ) survey region ( roughly @xmath7 , where the longer direction is north - south ) .",
    "the principal advantages of these data in comparison to the surveys listed above are that our data are either deeper , cover a wider area , or include a larger number of filters ( the inclusion of @xmath0 is particularly important for studies of dust and young stellar populations ) .",
    "however , as we show in our comparison to these other catalogs , each of the other surveys has its complementary strengths and we incorporate data from several of them to augment the mcps catalog .",
    "in addition to providing the catalog , we construct and analyze extinction maps of the smc .",
    "as we demonstrated for a portion of the lmc ( @xcite ) , the extinction properties in the clouds are not only spatially variable , but depend on stellar population .",
    "therefore , for many scientific purposes the catalog alone is insufficient , one must correct the observed magnitudes and colors for a complex extinction pattern .",
    "we describe the mcps in  2 , discuss detailed comparisons with previous data to assess the quality of the catalog in  3 , use the photometry to generate extinction maps of the smc for two different stellar populations in  4 , and present the final catalog in  5 .",
    "the data come from the ongoing magellanic cloud photometric survey ( @xcite ) . using the las campanas swope telescope ( 1 m ) and the great circle camera ( @xcite ) with a 2k ccd , we obtained drift - scan images for both magellanic clouds in johnson @xmath8 and gunn @xmath3 .",
    "the effective exposure time is between 4 and 5 min for smc scans and the pixel scale is 0.7 arcsec pixel@xmath9 .",
    "typical seeing is @xmath101.5 arcsec and scans with seeing worse than @xmath10 2.5 arcsec are not accepted .",
    "magnitudes are placed on the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system ( landolt 1983 ; 1992 ) .",
    "data from observing runs from november 1996 to december 1999 are included in this catalog .",
    "the data are reduced using a pipeline that utilizes daophot ii ( @xcite ) and iraf . only stars with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 detections",
    "are included in the final catalog .",
    "the pipeline for reducing individual scans is a fairly standard application of daophot .",
    "each of the 24 scans ( @xmath11 4 for the four filters ) , which are either 9500 or 11000 pixels long ( depending on whether they are on the eastern or western side of the smc survey region ) and 2011 pixels wide , is divided into 9 by 2 or 11 by 2 subscans that are roughly 1100 by 1100 pixels , with an overlap of about 100 pixels between the subscans that enables us to compare the results from the independent photometric reductions .",
    "there are two sources of discrepancy in the photometry from subscans ; differing and inconsistent psf models and aperture corrections , and nonphotometric conditions .",
    "the latter is difficult to evaluate on a subscan basis because each subscan is smaller than the 2k ccd used for the observations , and so adjacent subscans are not independent of atmospheric variations . comparing the photometry from adjacent scans , rather than subscans , enables us to check the observing conditions , which were judged by eye during the observing to be photometric almost entirely over the 4 years .",
    "these two classes of overlaps , subscan and scan , provide complementary internal checks .    the result of the reduction pipeline is a catalog of instrumental photometry for each detected star in each filter and its right ascension and declination . the astrometric solution is derived from a comparison to stars in the magellanic catalogue of stars ( macs ; @xcite ) , whose coordinates are on the fk5 system .",
    "solutions are reviewed and iterated if either the number of stars in the solution is less than 20 over the @xmath10 12 arcmin @xmath12 arcmin subscan , or the rms positional scatter of the matched stars is larger than 0.5 arcsec .",
    "there are only ten subscans for which we were unable to reduce the positional scatter below 0.5 arcsec ( and these have rms @xmath13 0.6 arcsec ) , while the median rms is 0.3 arcsec .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of stars in different filters are matched using a positional match that associates the nearest star on the sky within an aperture that is 3 times either the positional rms of that subscan or 1.2 arcsec , whichever is larger .",
    "the @xmath2 frame is used as the reference and only stars that have a match in the @xmath1 frame are retained for the final catalog . in crowded areas it is possible that the `` nearest '' star in one filter is not the correct match to the @xmath2 reference because of the uncertainties in the astrometric solution .",
    "we see some evidence of this problem when comparing to other data and when fitting atmospheric models ( stars with highly anomalous colors ) , but except near the faint limit of the catalog or in extremely crowded regions this issue appears to be a minor problem .",
    "it is evident that one could invest more effort in attempting to make `` correct '' matches , but the quality of the photometry in regions where multiple stars are within @xmath10 1 arcsec of each other in images with typical 1.5 arcsec seeing is strongly compromised in any case . in all cases",
    "we accept the closest match . unlike errors in the photometric calibration , these errors can be estimated reliably using artificial star simulations .",
    "to place each subscan on a self - consistent photometric system , we use the overlap region ( these typically contain several hundred stars in common in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and several tens in @xmath0 ) to measure photometric differences .",
    "each subscan has either two ( if at the front or back edge of a scan ) or three neighboring subscans within its scan and one more in the adjacent scan , unless the subscan is at the edge of the survey region .",
    "we calculate the median photometric shift of each subscan relative to its neighbors and we find the subscan with the largest offset .",
    "the photometry of that subscan is adjusted by the offset and the process is repeated until all subscans with a median offset that is greater than 0.02 magnitudes are corrected .",
    "this process converges quickly because of the use of medians rather than means .",
    "the subscans are then combined to produce a photometric catalog for each scan . a stellar density map , constructed from the resulting catalog , is visually inspected for areas that correspond to scan or subscan regions that are of anomalously high or low density relative to their neighbors .",
    "the photometry is adjusted interactively in these cases to correct the handful of clearly anomalous subscans or scans .",
    "this method only addresses anomalies that are @xmath14 0.05 mag .",
    "although we are concerned that this procedure could lead to systematic drifts from the correct zeropoints , our photometry is extensively tested by comparison to external data sets ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes are placed on the johnson - kron - cousins landolt system ( 1983 ; 1992 ) .",
    "residuals for the standard stars from our photometric solution are shown in figure  [ stands ] over the four year period of the observing program .",
    "the photometric solutions involve a zeropoint term , an airmass term , and one linear color term ( using @xmath15 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath16 for @xmath3 ) or two linear color terms ( @xmath17 and @xmath15 separately for @xmath0 ) . over the color range covered by the standards ( see figure  [ stands ] ) there is little evidence for additional color terms .",
    "the statistical zeropoint uncertainty is typically 0.02 mag per run , slightly higher in the @xmath0 band ( 0.03 to 0.04 mag ) with only one run having a @xmath0 band uncertainty as high as 0.047 mag .",
    "the catalog of astrometry and photometry for 5,156,057 stars is presented as an ascii table ( see table 1 for a sample ) .",
    "columns 1 and 2 contain the right ascension and declination ( j2000.0 ) for each star .",
    "columns 3 - 10 contain the pairings of magnitudes and uncertainties for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 magnitudes .",
    "the subsequent columns are described in  5 .",
    "@xmath2 band stellar density and luminosity maps of the smc are constructed from the catalog using stars with @xmath18 and shown in figure  [ smcimage ] .",
    "the digital catalogs allow one to make analogous images for a variety of populations ( for other examples see the maps of young stars and evolved stars by @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude limit of the survey varies as a function of stellar crowding .",
    "we find little visible evidence for incompleteness for @xmath19 ( figure  [ smcimage ] ) , but the scan edges become visible when plotting the stellar surface density for stars with @xmath20 ( figure  [ incomplete ] ) . because of different sky brightness levels , seeing , and transparency , any completeness variations will be most noticeable at scan boundaries .",
    "we conclude that the stellar density differences are due to image quality ( and the ability to resolve crowded stars ) , rather than either to variable sky brightness or transparency , because the scans have the larger density differences in the inner , crowded regions .",
    "in particular , the densities of the central four scans differ by a factor of 30% in the worst central areas for this range of magnitudes .",
    "in contrast , the outer isophotes , even at these magnitudes , are uniform across scan edges ( figure  [ incomplete ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath3 data are incomplete at brighter magnitudes than the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath3 photometry , even in sparse areas , is severely incomplete below @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( comparable limits in the two other bands are @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "any statistical analysis of this catalog fainter than @xmath18 requires artificial star tests to determine incompleteness , which is becoming significant at these magnitudes .",
    "the overlap regions between subscans provide an indication of the internal reliability of the photometry . because subscan comparisons use the same image",
    ", they reveal the variation in photometry due to the different point - spread function ( psf ) models and aperture corrections used for the analysis of each subscan .",
    "although the true psf of the overlap stars is obviously the same in both subscans ( since they come from the same original scan ) the psf models can vary among subscans due both to atmospheric effects and mechanical effects ( for example , small misalignments or position errors that are corrected in subsequent moves of the camera ) that are not the same over the entire subscan for each of the overlapping subscans . partially , the initial motivation for dividing the scans into 1k subscans was that psf variations appear manageable across individual subscans of this size .",
    "although variations are visible even in these smaller regions , the daophot psf is allowed to vary across the image , and the residuals after subtracting the fitted stars was deemed acceptable . with our internal and external tests",
    "we will determine the extent to which this conclusion is correct .",
    "our first internal photometric test is provided by the overlap stars between one half of a scan and the other .",
    "we combine all of the subscans along each side of the scan and then compare the photometry in the overlap region . again , because we are comparing the photometry for the very same stars within the same images , we are directly testing psf model variations .",
    "although apparently direct , this test is conservative in the sense that we are testing the psf models for stars at the very edges of the frames , where the psf models are most poorly constrained .",
    "the differences in stellar photometry across all of the scans where such overlap photometry is available are shown in figure  [ scancomp ] . in a few cases ,",
    "the overlap region is unavailable because a scan in a particular passband is offset sufficiently from the @xmath2 band scan that the overlap region , defined in the @xmath2 frame , does not contain duplicate photometry in the other filter .",
    "excursions in the photometry residuals shown in figure  [ scancomp ] come in two types : 1 ) a smoothly varying fluctuation ( see scan 19 in @xmath2 ) and 2 ) a discontinuous jump ( see middle of scan 4 in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the first type of variation is due to psf modeling variations .",
    "the psf model is tracking real psf variations , which are smoothly varying , differently in the two subscans , resulting in smooth differences in the photometry .",
    "the second type of variation is due to differences in the aperture corrections applied to the two different subscans .",
    "initially , we attempted to correct for clear offsets such as that seen for scan 4 in @xmath0 .",
    "however , we found that these applied offsets tended to make the photometry in the entire subscan worse .",
    "we conclude that there are psf variations in the subscan that are not well - modeled near the edge , but that the aperture correction , which is calculated from stars throughout the subscan , is correct on average , but incorrect at the edge of the scan in some cases .",
    "this subtlety illustrates how figure  [ scancomp ] provides an exaggerated view of photometric difficulties due to our focus on the edges of the scans .",
    "even so , the photometric differences are typically small ( the median of the rms deviations between different scan halves are 0.032 , 0.015 , 0.030 , 0.028 mag for @xmath25 and @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "the rms deviation is @xmath13 0.05 mag in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 for all scans , and is @xmath14 0.05 mag for only four @xmath0 and @xmath3 scans .",
    "our second internal test consists of examining the overlap regions between different scans . in this case , the images are taken under entirely different conditions , often in different years with different detectors .",
    "this test provides as good a test of the overall photometric accuracy as can be obtained internally .",
    "the magnitude differences along scans are shown for the four filters in figure  [ scans ] .",
    "scan pairs come in e - w pairs and have the greatest overlap with scans in the n - s directions .",
    "therefore , scans 1 and 3 overlap along a length of a scan , and scans 2 and 4 overlap . some scan pairs that should overlap , such as 5 and 7 ,",
    "do not overlap because of a slight telescope offset in at least one filter ( the gap between some scan pairs is visible in figure  [ smcimage ] .",
    "again , these plots tend to exaggerate problems because we are examining the edges of scans , where the psf s are most likely to be distorted due to camera misalignments and tracking errors ( as well as the poorly constrained psf models ) .",
    "the photometric differences are evidently larger than in the comparison of scan halves because this comparison is based on different images of the same stars .",
    "the scatter is greater than before , but there are also some continuous variations ( see the @xmath0 band comparison of scans 10 and 12 ) .",
    "even so , the median rms differences among the scans ( comparing all overlap stars with @xmath18 ) are 0.13 , 0.07 , 0.06 , and 0.05 mag for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively , these values are comparable or smaller than the quoted uncertainties for @xmath26 stars , which dominate the comparison . we conclude that to the limit of the data , we have achieved a stable and robust photometric system across the survey .",
    "our third internal test consists of using the red clump magnitude to examine spatial variations in photometry .",
    "we calculate the red clump mean magnitude in 70 @xmath11 70 arcsec boxes using stars that have @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "although large - scale variations in the mean magnitude may truly exists ( for example due to a tilt of the smc relative to a constant - distance surface ; see @xcite for a demonstration of an analogous effects in the lmc ) , any localized variation , in particular one that traces scan or subscan boundaries , reveals a problem region . in figure  [ clumpmos ]",
    "we show the maps of the residual in the mean red clump magnitude relative to the global average , for all filters .",
    "there are various important features in these panels .",
    "first , all four panels show increased noise toward the edges because there are fewer clump stars at large radii from the smc and contamination for foreground galactic stars is proportionally greater .",
    "second , the @xmath0 and @xmath3 band frames in particular show a suspicious feature just to the southwest of center .",
    "this is the most crowded region in the survey and we suspect that crowding has caused problems for the @xmath0 and @xmath3 photometry , which is not as deep as @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". the @xmath1 and @xmath2 photometry does not appear to have serious problems in this region at the magnitude of the red clump stars .",
    "the variations seen in the mid - left region of @xmath1 and in the center of the @xmath2 frame correspond to less than @xmath29 mags . because these variations are more irregular ( i.e. they do not follow the vertical or horizontal scan and subscan boundaries ) we can not determine whether these are real ( for example , due to extinction variations ) or due to photometric errors .    in conclusion",
    ", our internal tests suggest that there are photometric uncertainties of the order of a few hundreths of a magnitude between subscans and scans due to a combination of psf modeling errors and calibration uncertainties . with the exception of potential crowding errors in @xmath0 and @xmath3 in the densest region of the smc",
    ", the catalog appears to be limited by these uncertainties and poisson noise down to at least @xmath26 .",
    "we are fortunate to have an array of existing data over substantial portions of the smc with which we can further test the photometry in all four filter bands .",
    "@xcite has produced a catalog of smc photometry ( @xmath25 and @xmath30 ) for bright stars along the central ridge of the smc and toward the smc wing .",
    "in particular , because of his interest in the upper main sequence , he pays particular attention to obtaining accurate @xmath0-band photometry for young smc stars , which is often difficult because of the lack of blue ( @xmath31 ) standards .",
    "we discuss various comparisons between that catalog and ours",
    ".    _ astrometric accuracy _",
    "we match stars brighter than @xmath32 in massey s catalog to stars in the mcps by finding the star in the mcps within 7.5 arcsec of each massey star that has the closest @xmath2 magnitude . the large search radius and the addition of the magnitude criteria has the potential to bias us away from picking the nearest star in projection .",
    "however , the distribution of separations ( figure  [ masseycomp ] , upper left ) shows a strong peak toward matches with an offset that is @xmath33 arcsec ( the distribution peaks at @xmath34 arcsec ) . although all matched stars are included in figure  [ masseycomp ] , the offsets for stars with @xmath35 are somewhat larger and the reason for this is discussed in below .",
    "the astrometric correspondence between these two catalogs is excellent  certainly sufficient for spectroscopic follow - up of these stars .",
    "_ photometric zeropoint comparison _    in figure  [ masseycomp ] we plot @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 for matched stars in @xmath38 and @xmath2 , where @xmath36 is defined to be massey s magnitude minus the mcps magnitude .",
    "the bulk of the stars lie in a broad horizontal locus in these plots , with a flaring at @xmath35 toward positive residuals , and a flaring at @xmath39 , toward negative residuals . limiting the comparison to stars with positional offsets @xmath40 arcsec and @xmath41 for",
    "the @xmath0-band panel ( see below for discussion of the color cut ) and @xmath42 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( eliminating the brighter magnitudes , where the mcps has problems , and fainter magnitudes , where massey s data appear to have problems ; see below ) we calculate the mean offsets relative to @xmath36 = 0 to be @xmath43 ( after correction , see below ) , @xmath44 and @xmath43 mag for @xmath38 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "these offsets are consistent with the photometric zeropoint errors of the studies , although slightly larger than expected .",
    "fortunately , the colors , which are more sensitive to photometric zeropoint errors , are consistent between the two studies .",
    "we suspect that the systematic trend to negative mean residuals is at least in part due to the flaring toward negative residuals for individual stars at fainter magnitude , rather than a true photometric zero point difference .",
    "this flaring , as we show below , is due to crowding .",
    "an important consideration in this comparison , especially at the faint end , is that massey s magnitudes are aperture magnitudes within a large ( 8.1 arcsec ) aperture .    as already mentioned , in addition to the zeropoint offset of the horizontal locus , other features are visible in these diagrams .",
    "first , there is a diagonal flaring toward the upper left in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 panels of figure  [ masseycomp ] . these are stars from the @xcite catalog that are matched to a",
    " brighter \" star in our catalog . because this problem appears only at bright magnitudes",
    ", we suspect it is due to poor psf fitting of bright stars in the mcps . in figure  [ masseybright ]",
    "we show the color - magnitude diagrams for @xmath45 and highlight the stars with @xmath46 for both massey s catalog and the mcps .",
    "it is evident from the tightness of the upper main sequence and red supergiant envelope for these stars that massey s photometry is superior at these bright magnitudes ( the sequence visible between the main sequence and supergiants in the left panel are the foreground dwarfs ) .",
    "we conclude that stars in our catalog that are brighter than 13.5 in @xmath1 or @xmath2 are prone to substantial photometric uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we have replaced the photometry and astrometry in our catalog for stars brighter than this limit with that of @xcite . in replacing our photometry with massey s",
    ", we apply the mean photometric offsets found between the mcps and massey s catalog to massey s data .",
    "because massey s catalog does not cover the entire area of our survey , not every star in the mcps with @xmath47 has corrected photometry . to indicate which stars do have corrected photometry",
    "the catalog includes a flag ( see  5 for a discussion of all of the quality flags ) .",
    "809 stars are affected by this correction .",
    "the second systematic feature in these diagrams is the asymmetric distribution of @xmath36 toward fainter magnitudes . in this case",
    ", stars from the @xcite catalog have been matched to fainter stars in the mcps .",
    "such a mismatch could occur if massey s catalog is beginning to be susceptible to unresolved blending , which is likely given the 8.1 arcsec aperture used for the aperture photometry . by comparing color - magnitude diagrams of stars with residuals @xmath48 ( figure  [ masseyfaint ] )",
    ", we find that in contrast to the situation with positive @xmath36 , our data produce sharper main sequence and red envelope sequences .",
    "we conclude that at the faint magnitude limit of the comparison range our data are superior .",
    "_ photometric color term comparison _    in addition to zeropoint discrepancies , we use the massey s catalog to check for incorrect or missing color terms in our photometric solution .",
    "this issue is particularly important for the @xmath0 band because there are few blue calibration stars available in the standard fields .",
    "@xcite has taken particular care to include a significant number of blue upper main sequence stars in the calibration , so we have reason to believe that his calibration in this regime is superior to ours .",
    "the comparison of magnitudes for matched stars as a function of their @xmath15 color is shown in figure  [ masseycolor ] .",
    "there are no grossly discrepant color terms in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 photometry , but the @xmath0 band photometry shows a noticeable shift ( @xmath49 mag ) the bluer and redder stars . because we do not know whether the discrepancy lies in the bluer or redder stars , we apply the simplest ( linear ) correction to the @xmath0 band magnitudes that resolves this problem and minimizes the color differences between the mcps and massey s catalog .",
    "this correction involves increasing the magnitudes by 0.05 mag for stars with @xmath50 and decreasing them by 0.05 mag for stars with @xmath51 .",
    "we show the corrected photometry in figure  [ masseycolor ] . the only other potential missing color term is suggested by a feature in the @xmath1-band photometry at @xmath52 to 1.3 .",
    "this is a sufficiently sharp feature ( the @xmath1-band photometry returns to @xmath53 for @xmath54 ) that we do not correct for it and suspect that it is the result of beating between a slight difference in the filter transmission curve of the two studies and a spectral absorption feature in stars of this surface temperature . at worst",

    "_ verifying the uncertainties _    a critical component of catalogs such as",
    "the mcps is the uncertainty estimates .",
    "for example , the error distribution plays a key role in synthesizing color - magnitude diagrams to recover the star formation history .",
    "because the uncertainties come from a wide range of phenomena ( calibration , psf modeling , data quality variations , crowding ) , it is difficult to know whether the quoted uncertainties accurately reflect all of these . in particular",
    ", we need to verify that we understand the uncertainties that can not be recovered with artificial star tests , such as those in the photometric calibration .",
    "in figure  [ masseyhist ] we plot the distribution of magnitude differences for stars in massey s catalog and the mcps that are in a magnitude range that is minimally affected by saturation and crowding ( @xmath1 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath1 and @xmath57 ) and that have matches with separations less than 1 pixel ( 0.7 arcsec ) .",
    "the upper set of panels shows the @xmath36 distribution in magnitudes , the lower set shows the distribution in terms of standard deviations , propagating the uncertainty estimates from both catalogs .",
    "the histograms of @xmath36 for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 have a core that is actually slightly narrower than the gaussian prediction , and wings that are larger , particularly in @xmath2 .",
    "we suspect that the wings are due to zeropoint fluctuations between subscans that are somewhat larger than that suggested by the statistical errors of the photometric calibration ( we will see more evidence of this effect later ) .",
    "the @xmath0 band data is fitted by a gaussian that is twice as wide as expected , suggesting that the uncertainties are significantly underestimated .",
    "again , we suggest that in large part this reflects zeropoint fluctuations among scans . for example , additional random fluctuations of 0.03 mag in the photometric zeropoints from subscan to subscan are sufficient to account for the widened distribution .",
    "this fluctuation in the zeropoints is consistent with the results of the internal comparison discussed previously .",
    "_ zeropoint calibration _    the most extensive photometric data set available for comparison to our mcps",
    "is that provided by the ogle group ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have measured @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 magnitudes for stars along the central ridge line of the smc .",
    "again , we match stars between our catalog and theirs , and identify a magnitude regime where there appear to be no systematic problems . for this comparison",
    "we restrain the comparison to @xmath1 and @xmath58 , a faint limit of 15 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and 17 for @xmath3 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the mean photometric offsets are 0.011 , 0.038 , and 0.002 mag in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "these are all within the internal uncertainties of our zeropoint calibration and in the opposite sense as the zeropoint differences resulting from the comparison to the @xcite catalog .",
    "again , we suggest that at least some part of the mean offsets are not due to photometric zero point errors , but to the systematic trend at fainter magnitudes ( which is not due to calibration errors but rather to crowding ) . we conclude that our average , global photometric zeropoints are good to better than 0.03 mag .",
    "in figure  [ oglecomp ] we show the same astrometric and photometric comparison that we did previously for the @xcite catalog , except this time in @xmath60 @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we find again that the astrometric agreement is good to a fraction of a mcps pixel .",
    "regarding the magnitude comparison we find patterns similar to those seen previously . in the @xmath3 band comparison",
    "there is an upward tail at bright magnitudes .",
    "this is due to poorly modeled bright stars in the mcps .",
    "these tails are not visible in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 comparisons because the photometry of stars with @xmath1 and @xmath35 was already replaced with the @xcite photometry .",
    "we now replace the @xmath3 band photometry of suspect , bright stars ( @xmath61 ) and an associated flag is set in the catalog  see  5 ) .",

    "nevertheless , the uncertainties in the mcps catalog do include an approximation of the photometric uncertainties due to crowding .",
    "the @xmath36 distribution for the fainter stars is consistent , with the exception of a low - level tail toward positive residuals , with a gaussian of unit dispersion and the additional scatter due to subscan - to - subscan photometric variations discussed earlier .",
    "although the measurement uncertainties do reflect the crowding problems , any analysis that is sensitive to the details of the these errors should use artificial star tests ( see @xcite for a discussion of those tests ) .",
    "_ color terms _    using the matched stars , we examine whether there are color - term variations between the two studies . from figure  [ oglecolor ] , we conclude that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry have no residual color - term dependences .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 photometry appears to have a systematic residual at red colors . limiting the comparison to bright @xmath1 magnitudes , to avoid including many stars with large photometric residuals due to crowding",
    ", we still find the systematic color - dependent residual .",
    "such a color - term is feasible because there are few standard stars at these extreme colors ( figure  [ stands ] ) .",
    "however , the comparison to massey s catalog does not show such a problem ( figure  [ masseycolor ] ) . in that comparison",
    ", there is a photometry difference at @xmath63 , but by @xmath64 the @xmath1 photometry between the two studies agrees well ( while the mcps and ogle photometry disagree by 0.1 mag at @xmath64 ) . because the comparison of the mcps with these two surveys is inconclusive , and we have no further reason to suspect our photometry , we do not correct for the color term but caution that for the reddest stars there may be a @xmath1-band systematic error of @xmath65 mag in either our data or the ogle data .    _",
    "verifying the uncertainties _",
    "similar to our comparison to massey s catalog , we plot the distribution of magnitude differences for matched stars in units of magnitudes and standard deviations ( figure  [ oglehist ] ) for stars with astrometric differences @xmath13 0.7 arcsec , @xmath1 and @xmath55 , @xmath1 and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "a gaussian of width corresponding to the propagated uncertainties with an additional random photometric zeropoint uncertainty of 0.03 magnitudes agrees well with the distributions in all three bands .",
    "we conclude that the error estimates , with this small additional term due to uncertainties in the scan photometric zeropoints , describes the total uncertainties well at magnitudes where crowding does not play a role .    _ spatially varying photometric comparison _",
    "the large sample of stars in common between mcps and ogle enables us to compare the photometry spatially over the area in common , and so determine whether there are problems on the scale of an individual scan or subscan ( either in the mcps or ogle ) . in figure  [ oglemos ]",
    "we present maps of the photometric offsets ( median magnitude differences within square  pixels \" for the matched stars used earlier to study global differences ) for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "two types of spatial patterns are visible .",
    "the first consists either of vertical or horizontal striping .",
    "this striping is due to photometric errors in scans ( mcps has horizontal scans in this orientation , ogle has vertical scans ) .",
    "because different mcps scans , even in the same filters , may come from runs separated by several years , it becomes difficult to obtain photometry that agrees to better than the internal calibration errors ( typically @xmath68 mag ) .",
    "a horizontal edge is visible in the @xmath3-band , near the middle left of the image .",
    "vertical edges are visible in the right half of the @xmath3-band panel .",
    "the difference across these edges is @xmath29 mag from the mean for the most noticeable edges .",
    "the second spatial pattern is the increasing discrepancy ( especially in the @xmath2 band ) toward the smc center .",
    "this is almost certainly the effect of increasing crowding . at its worst",
    ", this offset appears to be 0.08 mag .    as the crowding increases beyond the ability of the data and software to disentangle ,",
    "it becomes increasingly likely that fainter stars will contaminate the photometry of brighter stars ( and that an increasing fraction of fainter stars will be lost ) .",
    "therefore , the detected stars will become increasingly brighter ( which is what is observed when comparing mcps data to ogle data in the crowded regions ) .",
    "ogle is superior in this respect for several reasons : 1 ) their template images are taken in seeing as good as 0.8 arcsec , 2 ) their pixel scale ( 0.417 arcsec pixel@xmath9 ) is much better suited to the best seeing episodes than ours , and 3 ) they use repeat observations to cull unreliable photometry . in particular , our @xmath2 scan of the central region is not optimum .",
    "obviously , higher quality data is desirable , but for some applications ( such as the generation of synthetic color - magnitude diagrams ) this effect can be included in the simulations and results only in a loss of information , not in a systematic error .",
    "alternatively , investigators interested in the densest regions of the smc may want to construct a hybrid catalog that uses ogle data along the smc ridge and mcps data beyond the ridge .",
    "users of the mcps should be aware that there is a bias toward measuring a brighter magnitude for a star as one approaches the more heavily crowded fields .",
    "finally , we compare our @xmath3-band photometry to that in the denis catalog .",
    "although the denis catalog is primarily an ir catalog , it contains an @xmath3 band channel and @xcite have extracted point - source catalogs in the regions of the magellanic clouds .",
    "we produce a similar comparison as to the massey and ogle catalogs , using a search aperture of 3.5 arcsec for matches .",
    "the distribution of astrometric and photometric differences for matched stars are plotted in figure  [ deniscomp ] . in agreement with our previous results , we find that the astrometric accuracy is subpixel for the majority of the matches .",
    "the mean difference is 0.9 arcsec , but the mode is @xmath34 arcsec .",
    "using only matched stars with positional offsets @xmath13 1 pixel , the zeropoint difference between the two surveys is @xmath69 mag .",
    "the distribution of photometry differences , in units of standard deviations , is entirely consistent with the propagated errors .",
    "we developed a technique for fitting published stellar atmosphere models ( @xcite ) to @xmath25 , and @xmath3 photometry to measure the effective temperature , @xmath70 , of the star and the line - of - sight extinction , a@xmath71 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the model fitting was least degenerate between @xmath70 and a@xmath71 for stars with derived temperatures in the ranges @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we construct a@xmath71 maps of the smc from the line - of - sight a@xmath71 measurements to the set of `` cool '' stars ( @xmath74 ) and the set of `` hot '' stars ( @xmath75 ) with good quality photometry ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) and good model fits ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "in addition to these criteria , we imposed a reddening - independent magnitude cut ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the extinction maps ( figure  [ extinctionmap ] ) have lower signal - to - noise at large projected radii from the smc because there are fewer stars at those radii . in particular , one should disregard the apparently low extinction toward the northwest in the  hot \" population map because there are few such stars in this region . because the recovery of a@xmath71 is quite sensitive to color ,",
    "subtle differences in the scan photometry are highlighted in the extinction maps ( in particular in that from the hot population ) .",
    "for example , a set of small photometric differences ( 0.03 mag in opposite senses in @xmath1 and @xmath3 , so that @xmath82 has changed by 0.06 mag ) creates an extinction discontinuity of the magnitude observed in the hot population map of figure  [ extinctionmap ] .",
    "the principal coherent extinction structure within the body of the smc is the increase in extinction in the hot star population along the ridge of the smc ( increasing to the southwest ) .",
    "this structure is not visible in the map from the colder stars indicating 1 ) that this structure may not be real , 2 ) that most cold stars in the smc are in the foreground relative to the hot stars , or 3 ) that the dust may be highly localized near the younger stars , such that the lines - of - sight to background , colder stars are unlikely to contain much dust .",
    "we reject the first option because this ridge corresponds well to the morphology of the 100@xmath83 iras emission ( figure  [ extinctionmap ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the second option appears unlikely , simply because the colder , older stars are more likely to be more extended along the line - of - sight , both toward the foreground and background , than the younger stars .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this observation implies that the dust along the smc ridge line is spatially highly localized around the young , hot population .",
    "the a@xmath71 histograms of the two populations are shown in figure  [ exthist ] . as we found for a region of the lmc ( @xcite ) , the mean",
    "extinction is lower for the cooler populations ( average a@xmath71 of 0.18 mag vs 0.46 mag for the cold vs. hot population , respectively ) . given a foreground extinction of @xmath10 0.15 mag toward the smc ( @xcite ) , the observed distribution of extinctions toward the colder stars suggests that there is little , if any , internal extinction in the smc of the light from the distributed older population .",
    "the principal difference between the smc and lmc a@xmath71 histograms is the lack of a high - extinction tail for the cold stars in the smc . for the lmc",
    ", this tail was interpreted to be the result of viewing roughly half of the colder stars through the irregular mid - plane dust layer associated with the hotter stars .",
    "we interpret the lack of such a tail in the smc as an indication that the smc has no pervasive dust layer that extincts light from background colder stars .",
    "this result is complementary to the explanation of the lack of a central ridge feature in the extinction map derived from the cold stars .",
    "the localization of the significant extinction near massive stars , and the corresponding lack of significant extinction elsewhere in the smc , has several causes .",
    "the low value of the global extinction is in part due to a dust - to - atomic gas ratio that is a factor of 30 below the galactic value ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lower dust abundance is related to the low observed abundance of co in the smc relative to the galaxy or lmc . the global scarcity of co",
    "is thought to arise because it is more easily photodissociated in the smc ( @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , the co that is present in the smc is concentrated along the central ridge , where most massive stars are found .",
    "we now have two cases ( both lmc and smc ) for which detailed line - of - sight extinction measurements have shown significant differences ( @xmath10 0.3 mag ) in the internal extinction of young and old stars .",
    "typically , internal extinction corrections for galaxies are derived from tracers of recent star formation ( for example , uv spectral slopes , @xmath17 colors , or h ii region line ratios ) .",
    "our results suggest that corrections derived from such tracers are likely to be too large if applied to the entire population of stars .",
    "the mcps catalog for the smc is presented as an ascii text file ( see table 1 for an example , the full catalog is provided electronically ) . to enhance the usefulness of our catalog we augment the mcps data in several ways .",
    "we have already described how we use data from @xcite and @xcite to correct our photometry for the brightest 0.02% of the cataloged stars ( @xmath25 for stars with @xmath1 or @xmath35 from massey s catalog and @xmath3 for stars with @xmath84 from ogle ) .",
    "column 11 of the catalog ( see table 1 ) is a quality flag that is the unique sum of several flags .",
    "stars for which we replaced photometry with that from massey s catalog have a quality flag of @xmath85 .",
    "stars for which we replaced photometry with that from ogle have a quality flag of @xmath86 ( a star with a quality flag @xmath87 has had its original photometry replaced with that from both massey s catalog and ogle ) .",
    "stars with measured magnitudes in @xmath25 and @xmath3 and @xmath88 and @xmath79 are fit with stellar atmosphere models (  4 ) . those stars for which this fit is successful ( @xmath80 ) are given a quality flag @xmath89 and those which are unsuccessful are given a quality flag @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , a star with a quality flag of 11 , for example , had its @xmath91 , and @xmath2 magnitudes replaced with those from massey s catalog and was successfully fit with a stellar atmosphere model .",
    "we supplement the mcps with ir data from the denis and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) surveys ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath5 , paired with their uncertainties , are in columns 12 - 17 ) .",
    "we match stars in a manner similar to our previous comparisons , except we use an acceptance aperture of 1 arcsec and we have no magnitude criteria .",
    "if a star is matched only in 2mass or denis data , then those data are used .",
    "if a star is matched to both catalogs , we use the average magnitude unless the ir magnitudes differed by more than 3@xmath94 from each other in which case we do not use either data .",
    "we encourage investigators to examine other combinations of the catalogs , for example stars which are detected in the ir surveys but not in the optical may provide an interesting sample of highly obscured stars .",
    "we are conducting a broad - band photometric survey of the magellanic clouds .",
    "our intent is to provide these data to the community as quickly as possible and here we present the data for over 5 million stars in the @xmath7 survey area centered on the small magellanic cloud . to enable potential users to understand these data we discuss various internal and external tests of the astrometry , photometry , and associated uncertainties .",
    "the catalog contains positions ( right ascension and declination in j2000 coordinates ) and @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 magnitudes and uncertainties in the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system measured from our drift scan images .",
    "we augment this catalog with indications of the data quality .",
    "lastly , we also provide the 2mass / denis ir magnitudes matched to our data for ease of use of a dataset that is complete in @xmath0 to @xmath95 for 91,428 stars , provides incomplete coverage through the infrared bands for 183,751 stars , and at least partial optical coverage for 5,156,057 stars .    using this catalog ,",
    "we have constructed extinction maps for two stellar populations in the smc .",
    "we find 1 ) that the bulk of the dust is concentrated along the ridge of the smc , 2 ) that this dust is highly localized near the younger , hotter stars , 3 ) that aside from these regions of higher extinction , the average internal extinction in the smc is consistent with zero , and 4 ) that the average extinction correction for the younger , hotter stars and the older , colder stars differs by about 0.3 mag .",
    "the latter conclusion is in agreement with what we found in the lmc ( @xcite ) . on a more general vein ,",
    "the two external galaxies for which we now have highly detailed maps of extinction as a function of stellar population both show significant differences in the extinction toward those populations .",
    "this difference , or at least the potential for this difference , should be considered when correcting the photometry of other galaxies for internal extinction .",
    "generalizing , these results suggest that internal extinction corrections , which are commonly derived from tracers of recent star formation , are typically overestimated .",
