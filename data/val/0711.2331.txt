    "the knowledge of the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) of charged particles from extensive air shower ( eas ) is vital for experiments in the field of ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) studying .",
    "it is ldf that defines main shower parameters such as @xmath4   ( charged particle density at the distance @xmath5  m from the core ) and thus   primary energy .    in this paper",
    "we consider parameters of individual ldfs resulted from revision of high energy events registered at the yakutsk eas array .",
    "the aim of this work is to trace possible correlation between parameters of individual showers and their arrival directions on the sky , especially for galactic planes and for the region with significantly increased uhecr flux , detected by yakutsk group  @xcite .",
    "for the analysis we selected showers with @xmath6  ev , with zenith angles @xmath7 and with core lying well within the boundaries of the array , to make sure that shower core is found correctly .    at the yakutsk eas array ,",
    "approximation proposed by greisen  @xcite is used for primary data processing : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is moiere radius and slope parameter @xmath10 .    in the work by glushkov et al  @xcite ,",
    "an updated approximation was proposed , that demonstrated better description of experimental points at large distances from the core ( @xmath11  m ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 .    in equations ( [ eq : nkg ] ) and ( [ eq : glushkov ] ) the slope parameter @xmath14 is derived from average ldf . while it describes most of showers quite well , it certainly fails doing so in dozen number of events . during revision we performed @xmath15-fitting of functions ( [ eq : nkg ] ) and ( [ eq : glushkov ] ) normalized to @xmath4 on experimental data for each",
    "selected shower with free parameters @xmath4 and @xmath16 .    the value @xmath17 could give a hint of possible astrophysical aspect of the slope parameter in functions ( [ eq : nkg ] ) and ( [ eq : glushkov ] ) .",
    "as seen on fig.[slope_galaxy ] , comparison to galactic coordinates showed no correlation between @xmath18 and galaxy plane .",
    "vs galactic latitude .",
    "marked stripe @xmath19 is galaxy plane.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to trace possible dependency on astrophysical coordinates , we selected a `` stripe '' of @xmath20 width along declination and divided it into `` chunks '' of @xmath21h each along right ascension .",
    "such a stripe was selected to exclude zenith - angular dependency . averaged @xmath18 values in each chunk are presented in table  [ tab : slope ] in comparison to averaged value in the rest chunks of the stripe .",
    "vs astrophysical coordinates.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         obtained @xmath22 values did not allow us to make juxtaposition with celestial coordinates as for functions ( [ eq : nkg ] ) and ( [ eq : glushkov ] ) .",
    "revised parameters of individual lateral distribution functions in greisen s ( ( [ eq : nkg ] ) and ( [ eq : glushkov ] ) ) approximation showed no correlation neither with galactic plane , nor with the region of uhecr region excess . from table  [ tab : slope ] it is seen , that increased @xmath18 in the region of interest ( @xmath23 ) is not significant and the whole picture is spoiled by poor statistics .",
    "difficulties in estimation of @xmath22 did now allow us to use scaling approximation  ( [ eq : lagutin ] ) in such analysis . in the work by msu eas group",
    "@xcite authors have faced similar obstacles in @xmath22 determination .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that kascade - grande group successfully used scaling formalism for estimation of muon density in air showers  @xcite . besides , scintillation detectors used at the yakutsk array may lead to sloping of charged particle distribution caused by registration of atmospheric muons and electrons from muon decay . if we consider this fact together with zenith - angular dependence of @xmath22 more closely , we can obtain more plausible estimation of this parameter .",
