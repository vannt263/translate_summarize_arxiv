    "this decay is punctuated by large spikes that are due to particularly large planetesimal collisions happening stochastically .",
    "examples of stochastic events in the recent history of the solar system are the fragmentation of the asteroids giving rise to the hirayama and veritas asteroid families ( the latter happening 8.3 myr ago and accounting for 25% of the present zodiacal thermal emission ; dermott _ et al . _ , 2002 ) and the dust bands observed by _ iras _ ( sykes and greenberg , 1986 ) .",

    "( 2007 ) . ]      as discussed above , there is observational and theoretical evidence that collisional evolution played a role in the evolution of solar and extra - solar debris disks .",
    "however , there is also evidence that additional non - collisional processes , likely related to the dynamical depletion of planetesimals that can result from gravitational interactions with massive planets , have also played a major role is disk evolution .    in the solar system",
    ", evidence comes from the late heavy bombardment ( lhb , or lunar cataclysm ) , a period of time in the solar system past during which a large number of impact craters in the moon and the terrestrial planets were created ( with an impact rate at earth of @xmath2020000@xmath23 the current value ) .",
    "this event , dated from lunar samples of impact melt rocks , happened during a very narrow interval of time  3.8 to 4.1 gyr ago ( @xmath20600 myr after the formation of the terrestrial planets ) .",
    "thereafter , the impact rate decreased exponentially with a time constant ranging from 10100 myr ( chyba , 1990 ) .",
    "( 2005 ) compared the impact cratering record and inferred crater size distribution on the moon , mars , venus and mercury , to the size distribution of different asteroidal populations , showing that the lhb lasted @xmath2020200 myr , the source of the impactors was the main ab , and the mechanism was size independent .",
    "the most likely scenario is that the orbital migration of the giant planets caused a resonance sweeping of the ab and as a result many of the asteroidal orbits became unstable , causing a large scale ejection of bodies into planet - crossing orbits ( explaining the observed cratering record ) , and an increased rate of asteroidal collisions that would have been accompanied by the production of large quantities of dust . under this scenario ,",
    "the lhb was a single event in the history of the solar system ( strom _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "a handful of extra - solar debris disks observed with _",
    "spitzer _ also show evidence of non - collisional evolution ( e.g. bd+20307 , hd 72905 , eta - corvi and hd 69830 ; wyatt _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) .",
    "a particularly interesting case is that of hd 69830 , a system that harbors three neptune - like planets inside 2au , shows a strong 24 @xmath3 m dust emission indicative of large quantities of warm grains , no 70 @xmath3 m dust emission indicative of a lack of cold dust , and a dust emission spectra with strong features remarkably similar to the spectra of comet hale bopp ( figure 5  beichman _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005a ) .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that its 24 @xmath3 m emission , seen as an outlier in figure 4 , implies a very high dust production rate that could not possibly have been sustained for the entire lifetime of the star and must therefore be a transient event rather than the results of steady collisional evolution .",
    "its transient nature would account for the fact that hd 69830 shows strong silicate emission features indicative of the presence of large quantities of small grains .",
    "these grains have a very short lifetime and therefore must have been produced in a recent event .",
    ", 2007 suggested that we may be witnessing a lhb - type of event in which icy planetesimals originally located outside the orbit of the planets are scattered into the inner system producing the observed dust .",
    "the models and observations described above for both solar and extra - solar systems indicate that in a planetesimal swarm there is collisional evolution that produces dust , triggered by the largest ( pluto - sized ) planetesimals in the swarm , and on top of that , depending on the planetary configuration , there may be drastic dynamical events that produce very significant depletion of planetesimals and an increased rate of planetesimal collisions and dust production .",
    "the next section discusses how the presence of planets not only can affect the production of debris dust , but can also sculpt the debris disk by creating a rich diversity of spatial structure .",
    "even though the great majority of debris disks observations are spatially unresolved , their structure can be studied in some detail through the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the disk because different wavelengths in the sed trace different distances to the star , so that an sed with sufficiently high spectral resolution can be used to constrain roughly the radial distribution of dust . recent _",
    "debris disks surveys suggest that debris disks commonly show evidence of the presence of inner cavities , as most systems show 70 @xmath3 m dust emission ( from cold dust ) , but no emission at @xmath24@xmath25 24 @xmath3 m ( i.e. , no warm dust ; see e.g. meyer _ et al . _ , 2004 ; beichman _ et al . _ , 2005b ; bryden _ et al .",

    "high resolution spatially resolved observations have been obtained for a handful of nearby debris disks and indeed these images show the presence of inner cavities together with more complex morphology , like warps , spirals , offsets , brightness asymmetries and clumpy rings ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "dynamical simulations of the orbits of dust particles and their parent planetesimal in systems where massive planets are present suggest that this complex morphology could be the result from gravitational perturbations by planets ( e.g. roques _",

    "the basic mechanisms by which the planets can affect the debris disks structure are the following :    * _ ejection by gravitational scattering : _ this process can affect dust particles as they spiral inward under p - r drag , and dust - producing planetesimals , in the case when the planet migrates outwards , resulting in a depletion of dust inside the orbit of the planet ( an inner cavity ) .",
    "dynamical simulations show that this process can be very efficient , ejecting @xmath190% of the particles in the case of a 310 m@xmath26 planet located between 130 au around a solar - type star . * _ trapping in mean motion resonances ( mmr ) with the planet : _ in a system where the dust producing planetesimals are located outside the orbit of the planet , as the dust particle drift inward due to p - r drag they can get trapped in mmrs with the planet .",
    "the mmrs are located where the orbital period of the planet is @xmath27 times that of the particle , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are integers , @xmath28@xmath10 and @xmath30@xmath311 . at these locations the particle receives energy from the perturbing planet that can balance the energy loss due to p - r drag , halting the inward motion of the particle and giving rise to planetary resonant rings . due to the geometry of the resonance ,",
    "the spatial distribution of material in resonance is asymmetric with respect to the planet , and this can explain the clumpy structure observed in some disks ( figure 1 ) .",
    "an example of mmr trapping of kb in the solar system can be seen in figure 2 , where the ring - like structure , the asymmetric clumps along the orbit of neptune , and the clearing of dust at neptune s location are all due to the trapping of particles in mmrs with the planet , while the dust depleted region inside 10 au is due to gravitational scattering by saturn and jupiter .",
    "mmrs can also affect the location of the planetesimals and the dust when the planets migrate outward . * _ effects of secular perturbations : _ these are the long - term average of the perturbing forces and act on timescales @xmath10.1 myr ( see review by wyatt _ et al . _ , 1999 ) .",
    "if the planet and the planetesimal disk are not coplanar , the secular perturbations tend to align the orbits and in the process they will create a warp in the disk .",
    "if the planet is in an eccentric orbit , the secular perturbations will force an eccentricity on the dust particles , creating an offset in the disk center with respect to the star that can result in a brightness asymmetry .",
    "other effects of secular perturbations are spirals and inner gaps .",
    "finally , it is important to point out that because the debris disk structure is sensitive to the presence of planets located far from the star , the study of the structure could be used as a potential planet detection method that would be complementary to the well - established radial velocity and transit techniques ( sensitive to close - in planets ) .",
    "large surveys of debris disks over a wide range of evolutionary states , enabled by high sensitivity spaced - based ir telescopes like @xmath0 , are starting to provide a `` movie '' of how planetary systems evolve with time . in this",
    "regard , debris disks help us place our solar system into a broader context and vice versa , the study of the solar system , in particular its dynamical history and the characterization of its small body population , sheds light on the physical processes giving rise to the debris disk phenomenon .",
    "debris disks surveys , together with the results from planet searches , can help us understand the frequency of planetesimal and planet formation and the diversity of planetary systems , which ultimately addresses one of the most fundamental questions : is the solar system common or rare ?",
