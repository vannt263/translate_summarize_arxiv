    "the question of measuring of the spatial non - commutativity effects , in physical processes , is under intensive interest .",
    "non - commutative qed ( ncqed ) seems to be a straightforward method to examine such effects . for this purpose",
    ", one needs a precise experimental data such as positronium hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) among the other processes .",
    "the basic difference between ncqed and qed is the existence of new interactions ( 3-photon and 4-photon vertices ) which complicate the calculations in ncqed .",
    "although the feynman rules of this theory are given in @xcite , to apply these rules to bound state , one needs special treatments like bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach @xcite or non - relativistic qed ( nrqed)@xcite . in our preceding letter @xcite , using bs equation , we have shown that up to the order @xmath4 no spin - dependent correction owing to the spatial non - commutativity appears in the positronium spectrum",
    ". therefore one should calculate the higher order corrections . in this letter",
    "we calculate the corrections to the positronium by using nrqed method . in section 2 , we introduce nrqed - vertices in the nc - space .",
    "consequently , in section 3 , we use the modified nrqed to determine hfs at the lowest order . in this section , we show that our calculations at the leading order lead to the corrections at the order of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the parameter of non - commutativity . at the end , we summarize our results .",
    "nrqed is an effective field theory which simplifies the bound state calculation . to apply this technique in non - commutative space one should modify the nrqed vertices by performing @xmath5 expansion on ncqed scattering amplitude . in doing so",
    ", one obtains an effective theory of non - relativistic particles which permits the direct application of well tested techniques based on schrdinger s equation .",
    "now , comparing ncqed scattering amplitudes with nrqed can completely determine the matching coefficients .",
    "some of the vertices with their appropriate matching coefficients , are shown in fig .",
    "1 . they contribute to the tree level matching to get the leading order bound state energy shift .",
    "one should note that these coefficients apart from a phase factor are very similar to the standard nrqed @xcite .",
    "this similarity is owing to the fact that the scattering amplitude of @xmath6 in ncqed is independent of the parameter of non - commutativity of space @xcite .",
    "the other vertices which are not shown in fig . 1 and have not counterpart in the standard nrqed , due to the existence of the three and four photon vertices have contributions to higher order corrections to energy shift .",
    "now , by using the first graph of fig . 1 and expanding the vertices up to order @xmath1 , one can easily verify the results of refs.@xcite at the order @xmath7 as @xmath8 such an energy shift is spin - independent and therefore has not any contribution to hfs .",
    "by using the modified nrqed we can determine the diagrams which contribute to the lowest order of hfs ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    we can now calculate each diagram separately as follows : @xmath9 with @xmath10_i \\frac{-1}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\delta_{ij}-\\frac{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_i({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_j}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{e({\\bf",
    "p}'+{\\bf p})}{2m_e}e^{i p\\wedge p'}\\right]_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the parameter of the non - commutativity is given as @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is shown that @xmath14 leads to some problems with the unitarity of field theory and the concept of causality @xcite , therefore in our calculations we consider @xmath15 . + after some algebra eq.([p1 ] ) yields @xmath16\\psi({\\bf r})\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\alpha}{2m_e^2}\\left<\\frac{{\\bf s}_1.{\\bf l } } { r^3}\\right>-\\frac{3\\alpha } { m_e^2}\\int d^3 r ( \\theta .{\\bf l } \\psi^*)\\frac{{\\bf s}_1.{\\bf l}}{r^5}{\\psi}+o(\\alpha^7),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the third equality we used @xmath19",
    "one should note that the first term in eq.([p4 ] ) is the usual term in nrqed which is of the order @xmath20 .",
    "but the second term which is appeared in eq.([p4 ] ) , owing to the spatial non - commutativity is of the order @xmath0 .",
    "nonexistence of the terms at the order of @xmath4 which carry @xmath1-dependence is a remarkable result which happens in all diagrams of hfs .",
    "indeed this fact is due to appearance of @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 in all energy - correction expressions .",
    "therefore , to obtain the energy corrections for hfs at the order @xmath23 one should once calculate the corrections up to the lowest order of nrqed ( i.e. fig .",
    "2 ) . in the other words , the @xmath24-corrections in nrqed calculations of commutative space lead to the higher order of @xmath25 in non - commutative space .",
    "+ now we work out the figs .",
    "2(b - f ) as follows : @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28_i \\frac{-1}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\delta_{ij}-\\frac{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_i({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_j}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{-ie({\\bf p}'-{\\bf p})\\times{\\bf{\\sigma_2}}}{2m_e}e^{i p\\wedge p'}\\right]_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which results in @xmath29\\frac{1}{4\\pi r}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( \\ldots)+\\frac{3e^2}{16\\pi m_e^2}\\int d^3r\\psi({\\bf r})\\tilde\\gamma_e\\psi^*({\\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 means the usual part of the energy shift and @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 . the final diagram ( fig .",
    "2f ) has not any contribution at the order of our interest . for @xmath33",
    "one can easily find @xmath34\\ell\\psi({\\bf r})\\nonumber\\\\ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_a+\\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_b&=&\\frac{1}{2}(\\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_c+ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_d)\\nonumber\\\\ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_e&=&\\frac{3e^2}{16\\pi m_e^2}\\int d^3 r \\psi({\\bf r})\\overline{\\gamma}\\psi^*({\\bf r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 the superscript nc in eq .",
    "( [ p11 ] ) means the non - commutative part of the energy shift and three lines in the eq.([p12 ] ) are related to @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile for the spin zero state ( @xmath37 ) , all contributions to the energy shift are zero .",
    "+ the average of @xmath38 over the triplet is zero , which means the spin - spin interaction part carries no correction in average and therefore the hyperfine splitting due to the non - commutativity becomes @xmath39\\ell\\psi_{nlm}({\\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the wave function of the positronium in the commutative space with the coulomb potential and we have defined @xmath41 .",
    "if the @xmath42-axis is chosen parallel to the vector @xmath43 , the above result simplifies into @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the compton wave length of the electron and @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 one should note that the divergence of @xmath48 at @xmath49 is owing to singularity of @xmath50 at @xmath51 , the region where @xmath1-expansion is not well - defined .",
    "actually , it is shown that @xmath1-expanded ncqed is not renormalizable @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion imply a cut - off @xmath52 while the validity of nrqed requires @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath54 , the appropriate cut - off is @xmath55 .",
    "therefore the energy shift for @xmath2 , @xmath49 can be obtained as @xmath56\\alpha^6.\\ ] ]    the above result should be added to the values of hfs derived in nrqed at the order @xmath23 .",
    "the reported uncertainties on the experimental values of @xmath3 are about @xmath57 mhz @xcite , that give an upper bound @xmath58 . therefore determining the value of @xmath59",
    "requires more accurate experiments .",
    "using nrqed method in the non - commutative space , we have obtained that there is not any correction at the order @xmath4 for the hfs of positronium , the order @xmath4 corrections are spin independent .",
    "the correction to the energy shift is started at the order @xmath23 , eqs .",
    "( [ p13]-[p14 ] ) , and it depends on @xmath60 and @xmath61 quantum numbers . therefore it dosent have any contribution to the @xmath62 ( in the spectroscopic notation @xmath63 ) , while for @xmath64 there is @xmath65 different shifts .",
    "consequently , a closer look at the spacing between @xmath2 triplet excited levels ( @xmath3 ) , which has already been measured [ 14 - 17 ] can provide an experimental test on the non - commutativity of space . + * acknowledgement * + s.m.z .",
