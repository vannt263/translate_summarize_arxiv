    "it is widely accepted that potential scalability by means of the present - day or prospective microelectronic technology is the main advantage of solid state qubits , and in particular , superconducting qubits ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the many requirements necessary to realize this potential is a reasonably high integration density of both the qubit and control circuits , which almost unavoidably means that control circuits should be located close to qubits with their milli - kelvin operating temperatures , and are allowed to dissipate only small amount of energy .",
    "the requirement of low energy dissipation and ability to function below liquid - helium temperatures make superconductor single - flux - quantum ( sfq ) devices @xcite the most promising candidate for prospective qubit control circuit technology @xcite . reported sfq devices are also much faster than their semiconductor counterparts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and , as a result , should provide a much better accuracy of qubit control .",
    "although the sfq circuits have been investigated for many years , one of the implied `` design objectives '' of these investigations was the possibility to increase rather than decrease operating temperature , and many of the suggested approaches can not be immediately applied to qubit control circuits .",
    "the main new obstacle introduced by low operating temperatures is a dramatic degradation of thermal conductivities of all materials at milli - kelvin temperatures .",
    "this should cause strong overheating of the sfq circuits , which dissipate power that is small in comparison to semiconductor devices , but is still very significant in the sub - kelvin temperature range .",
    "overheating establishes effective temperature of the sfq components far above the bath temperature .",
    "it also affects the qubit part of the circuit both directly , through the heat flow to qubits , and indirectly , by creating stronger electromagnetic noise that acts as an extra source of decoherence for qibits .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze the overheating problem facing sfq circuits at sub - kelvin temperatures .",
    "the analysis results in semi - quantitative understanding of the magnitude of the sfq - induced disturbance of the qubits , and re - scaling of the sfq circuits required to satisfy thermal constraints of the sub - kelvin temperature range .",
    "the main elements of this re - scaling can be summarized as follows . for a given clock frequency of a conventional sfq circuit ,",
    "its power dissipation @xmath0 is proportional to typical critical current of the josephson junctions in the circuit . in its turn",
    ", the critical current can not be reduced below some thermal value which scales linearly with effective operating temperature @xmath1 of the circuit because of the thermally induced errors in its dynamics .",
    "finally , the temperature @xmath1 is determined by the balance between the dissipated power @xmath0 and efficiency of the heat removal from the circuit .",
    "qualitatively , since the thermal conductivities of all materials show strong dependence on the temperature @xmath1 , direct re - scaling of conventional sfq circuits will be capable of providing only relatively modest reduction of their effective temperature ( in practical terms , to about 0.4 k ) .",
    "overheating of the sfq components of this magnitude requires their careful thermal insulation from the qubits , which in the case of sfq circuits with large complexity can be easily achieved by placing them on a separate chip .",
    "alternative solutions , such as specially modified substrates or advanced thermal coupling with the sink , are more complicated and as a result they could be recommended for `` industrial type '' projects .",
    "temperature of a superconductor integrated circuit is defined by the balance of the power dissipated in the circuit resistances and the efficiency of transfer of this power from the circuit to the sink .",
    "we start by discussing the thermal conductance between heat - generating resistors and the heat sink . a typical thermal structure of a superconductor circuit",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ crosscecab ] .",
    "its complexity makes precise determination of temperature distribution in prospective sfq and qubit circuits hardly possible .",
    "there are several factors that have the main effect on the temperature distribution .",
    "the first is the electron - phonon coupling limiting the heat transfer between electron gas and the lattice which is responsible for the electron overheating .",
    "the magnitude of the lattice overheating is mainly determined by the competition of the thermal resistance associated with the phonon propagation along the substrate on the one hand , and on the other hand , the boundary ( `` kapitza '' ) resistances between the adjacent layers of different materials due to their acoustic mismatch or the thermal resistance of amorphous dielectrics ( typically sio@xmath2 and different epoxies ) used for electric isolation of circuit components and for thermal connections of the integrated circuit with the sink .",
    "phenomenologically , all heat transfer mechanisms should be rather similar at low temperatures , and are characterized by the material - independent power @xmath3 of the power - law dependence of the heat flux on temperature , a material - dependent prefactor @xmath4 in this power - law @xcite . in the `` differential '' form , expression for the heat flux @xmath0 between the two regions with temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 is valid for small temperature difference @xmath7 : @xmath8the corresponding `` integral '' expression valid for arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath9 is @xmath10    in the next subsections we discuss different specific mechanisms of the heat conduction and their effect on the temperature distribution in the sfq circuits .",
    "electrons in the bias and shunt resistors are the main sources of the dissipated energy in the sfq circuits , and as a result , have the highest temperature among the elements of the circuit .",
    "this temperature is the most important one for the circuit operation since the magnitude of the fluctuation - induced errors obviously depends on the electron rather than phonon temperature .",
    "resistors in the sfq circuits are typically attached at the ends to superconducting electrodes so that the heat flow through the contacts is suppressed by andreev refection .",
    "electron - phonon relaxation provides then the main mechanism of electron cooling in the resistors . according to the standard model of this relaxation in a metal , steady - state electron temperature @xmath11 and the lattice temperature @xmath12 in the resistor",
    "are related as follows @xcite : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the heat flux between the electrons and the lattice , @xmath15 is a material constant , and @xmath16 is the volume of the resistor . for metals , typical value of @xmath15 is @xmath17 wm@xmath18k@xmath19 .",
    "equation ( [ eltemp ] ) shows that electron - phonon coupling decreases very rapidly with temperature , and at sub - kelvin temperatures electrons in the resistors are significantly overheated by electrical current . because of the strong power - law dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eltemp ] ) , and for power values relevant for the sfq circuits , electron temperature is determined mostly by the applied power and only little by the lattice temperature and for @xmath20 can be safely estimated as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the joule heating due to electrical current through the resistor .",
    "for the power range and resistor volumes of interest ( on the order of nw and @xmath23m@xmath24 , respectively ) , this estimate falls into the temperature interval 0.1 k - 1 k. in this temperature range , the thermal resistance ( @xmath25 ) between phonons in the film and the substrate is usually taken to be rather small compared to the electron - phonon resistance ( @xmath26 ) due to strong coupling between phonon systems in a thin film and a substrate @xcite , so that the effective `` electron - substrate '' coupling can be described by eq .",

    "the idea of the experiment was to use transition at temperature @xmath31 of mo resistor from normal to superconducting state as an electron thermometer and estimate the electron - phonon thermal coupling as follows . in spite of the limitation that we can detect only one electron temperature @xmath31 ( measured to be @xmath32 k for these mo resistors ) we can measure the joule heating power needed to keep the resistor in the resistive state at a temperature just above @xmath31 , for different ( smaller ) lattice temperatures .",

    "the joule heating is very strong , and only by reducing the current far below the critical current to @xmath38 ( d @xmath35 e in fig . [ mores1](a ) ) we reduce the electron temperature sufficiently to finally detect transition back to the superconducting state ( e @xmath35 f ) .",

    "generally an sfq circuit contains a large number of resistors with different electronic temperatures and the error rate depends on all these temperatures .",
    "however , the cumulative effect of electronic temperatures @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the two resistors used to bias ( @xmath48 ) and shunt ( @xmath49 ) the same josephson junction can be reduced to a single noise temperature @xmath50 : @xmath51 to get a feeling for the magnitude of possible electron overheating we estimate the noise temperature @xmath50 for a typical junction with critical current @xmath52 10 @xmath53a biased by the dc current @xmath54 = 7 @xmath23a .",

    "shunt resistor @xmath49 can in principle be much colder ( with @xmath11 approaching @xmath70 ) since the current flows via it only during short ( pico - second ) sfq pulses generated by the josephson junction .",

    "[ thdes](b ) ) . the relatively high thermal resistance along the substrate as compared to the resistance between the substrate and the sample holder makes it possible to keep qubits at low temperature ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the increase of power dissipation above 500 nw requires even better thermal separation of the circuits , and in this case the sfq circuits could not be placed on the same chip with the qubits .",
    "the two - chip design ( fig .  [ thdes](c)-(e ) ) practically eliminates the problem of overheating of qubit circuitry .",
    "moreover , it allows utilization of two independent fabrication technologies for sfq and qubit circuits , and as a result , the conventional sfq circuits can be immediately used in qubit support circuits .",
    "both chips can be kept on the same metal sample holder ( fig .",
    "[ thdes](c ) ) if the dissipated total power does not increase @xmath28 significantly above the temperature of the mixing chamber .",
    "usually the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is not a problem up to a dissipation level of few @xmath23w . for higher power ( more complicated sfq circuits )",
    "the separate active cooling of both circuits is required ( fig .",
    "[ thdes](d ) ) .",
    "the quantum circuit is supposed to be at the temperature below 50 mk , but the sfq chip can be kept at higher temperature ( @xmath175 ) . in this case",
    "few different refrigerating stages with the cooling power in the mw range can be used for cooling sfq circuits .",
    "as discussed above , the electron temperature of shunt resistors in the sfq circuits with reduced critical current should typically be about 500 mk and does not strongly depend on the lattice temperature which is below 500 mk .",
    "a @xmath44he evaporation refrigerator delivering enough cooling power at a temperature of about 300 mk is a very attractive solution for cooling sfq circuits .",
    "unfortunately this leads to essential complication of cryogenic equipment .",
    "a more natural solution is to make use of different stages in the dilution refrigerator for cooling the sfq circuit : 1 k pot ( temperature 1 - 2",
    "k ) or @xmath44he evaporator ( 600 - 800 mk ) . the latter is more attractive and natural due to lower temperature and because some heating of this stage is in any case necessary for operation of the dilution refrigerator .",
    "when we consider two circuits mounted at different temperatures , the thermal load through connecting wires should be limited to prevent overheating of the qubit circuit . in the case of superconducting",
    "( nb , al ) leads connecting two chips at 1 k and at 20 mk , respectively , a heat load is about 100 nw , if the total cross - section area of the wires is 0.1 mm@xmath176 and the length is 10 mm .",
    "this may be acceptable in most cases , but an inductive or / and capacitive coupling between the circuits ( fig .",
    "[ thdes ] ( e ) ) is a more suitable option for a fully scalable solution .",
    "our discussion assumed a chip size 5 @xmath177 5 mm@xmath176 glued to a bulk copper heat sink , and the power levels mentioned above should be considered as order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "these estimates can be affected by changes in the system design , i.e. , different substrate materials and geometry ( both area and thickness ) , improved thermal contact between the substrate and the heat sink ( increased contact area , modification of the contact surfaces , etc . ) , and more powerful dilution refrigerator .",
    "the direct way of transferring sfq circuit design to the sub - kelvin temperature range is to reduce all currents , including critical currents of josephson junctions and dc bias currents , proportionally to the effective temperature of the junctions . with this scaling",
    ", the existing technology can then be used as such and most of the existing sfq logic elements can be adopted with some modifications .",
    "we carried out such scaling for several basic sfq circuits , and present here the results for the simplest circuit , a balanced comparator .",
    "the balanced comparator is one of the principal building blocks of more complex circuits , but it can also be used directly as a thermometer , providing a convenient way of testing thermal characteristics of the circuit .",
    "the circuit ( fig .  [ comp ] ) contains three shunted josephson junctions and requires for its operation three dc bias currents .",
    "one bias current provides the necessary dc bias of comparator junctions j2 and j3 .",
    "the junctions are in superconducting state and carry dc current about 70% of their critical currents .",
    "the other bias current is applied to a relatively low resistance @xmath178 to supply a low , e.g. 12@xmath43v , voltage drop @xmath179 .",
    "junction j1 converts this dc voltage into a sequence of sfq pulses generated with frequency @xmath180 .",
    "the sfq pulses escape from the circuit either via junction j2 or via junction j3 depending on the dc current @xmath181 .",
    "thermal or quantum noise smoothes the otherwise sharp transition between these two escape channels . according to a",
    "well - developed and experimentally confirmed theory , the current width @xmath182 of the `` gray zone '' of this transition in the regime dominated by thermal fluctuations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is : @xmath183 here @xmath184 and @xmath185 is a dimensionless parameter determined by comparator and driver characteristics - see @xcite for details .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath182 can be used to determine electronic temperature in the shunt resistors .",
    "the comparator was fabricated using standard 100 a/@xmath61 nb trilayer process of hypres with pdau resistors .",
    "the layout of the comparator , which includes two nominally identical junctions ( left part of the circuit ) and the driver , is shown in fig .",
    "the comparator parameters , @xmath36 = 10 @xmath23a , @xmath49 = 2 @xmath57 , were chosen for operation at sub - kelvin temperatures .",
    "the junction critical current @xmath36 was thus reduced by an order of magnitude from its usual value for temperatures around 4 k. for these parameters , the junctions are overdamped , and the crossover temperature @xmath186 between the regimes of thermal and quantum fluctuations @xcite is given by the relation @xmath187 70 mk , where @xmath188 .",
    "this means that quantum broadening of the gray zone of the comparator can be neglected in our measurements .",
    "the measurement procedure was similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite : the width @xmath182 of the gray zone was obtained from the dc voltage @xmath189 across one of the comparator junctions as a function of the applied current @xmath181 ( inset in fig .",
    "[ grzon ] ) and its temperature dependence is presented in fig .",
    "[ grzon ] .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the theoretical prediction in the thermal limit [ eq .  ( [ grz ] ) ]",
    "assuming that the effective electron temperature of the resistors coincides with the bath temperature @xmath1 . at bath temperatures above 0.4 k experimental behavior of @xmath182 agrees well with the theoretical prediction . at lower temperatures",
    ", @xmath182 does not demonstrate noticeable dependence on @xmath1 as a result of the overheating of the comparator circuit .",
    "this prevents the reduction of electron temperature below 0.4 k.    electrical and geometrical parameters of the circuit can be used to estimate the electron temperature expected from the heating model discussed in sec .",
    "ii . the circuit contains four resistors .",
    "two shunt resistors of the comparator junctions are located about 4 @xmath23 m from the junctions .",
    "each of them occupies an area 7.25 @xmath23 m @xmath19012.5 @xmath23 m @xmath191 90 @xmath43m@xmath176 .",
    "one more resistor with the area 10.5 @xmath43 m @xmath190 14.5 @xmath43 m",
    "@xmath192152 @xmath43m@xmath176 shunts the driver junction j1 and is located at about 50 @xmath43 m from the comparator junctions . the last resistor @xmath178 ( seen in the layout of fig .",
    "[ comp ] as 4 resistors in parallel ) has the total area 25.5 @xmath23 m @xmath190 6 @xmath23 m x 4 @xmath191 612 @xmath43m@xmath176 and is 125 @xmath43 m away from the comparator .",
    "all resistors are made of 0.1 @xmath43 m ptau film with 2 @xmath57 sheet resistance , and designed values of the comparator shunts , driver shunt , and resistor @xmath193 are 2 @xmath57 , 1.8 @xmath57 , and 1.4 @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the voltage drop across the generator shunt , @xmath193 resistor , and the cumulative voltage drop on both comparator shunts are all about 12 @xmath43v , while the distribution of the voltage between the two comparator junctions j2 and j3 depends on the current @xmath181 .",
    "we estimate electron temperature @xmath11 in the shunts of the comparator junctions at the center of the gray zone ( @xmath194 ) , when both shunts have the same voltage drop 6 @xmath43v .",
    "the shunt parameters from the previous paragraph give their volume @xmath195 m@xmath44 and the dissipated power @xmath196 w. using these numbers together with negligible phonon temperature @xmath70 and an estimate of electron - phonon constant ( [ sigma ] ) in eq .",
    "[ eltemp ] , we get @xmath197   k. remote resistors do not affect the estimate of @xmath198 .",
    "their electrical noise changes only the comparator bias and does not contribute to the width of the gray zone in the case of identical junctions j2 and j3 .",
    "the phonon overheating in the vicinity of the comparator junctions due to the power dissipated in these resistors can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) to be negligible , @xmath199 mk .",
    "this means that electron overheating in the junction shunt resistors is indeed the dominant overheating factor in our experiment .",
    "we note that the measured overheating is somewhat higher than the estimate within our model .",
    "the most probable reason for this discrepancy is a small asymmetry between the junctions j2 and j3 which makes it possible for the noise of all resistors in the circuit to contribute to @xmath182 . in view of this and other possible sources of extra",
    "broadening , agreement between the estimate of @xmath198 and the observed saturation of @xmath182 is quite good .",
    "we have analyzed thermal properties of a typical sfq circuit at sub - kelvin temperatures and performed several measurements testing the basic elements of the heat conduction scheme ( fig .  1 ) of the circuit .",
    "local overheating of electrons in resistors is controlled by electron - phonon coupling , while global overheating of the chip is determined by the competition between ballistic phonon propagation along the substrate and the leakage into the heat sink that is limited by the kapitza resistance or the thermal resistance of the glue layer .",
    "our analysis and data suggest that integration of simple sfq circuits with qubits on a single chip should be possible if the total power dissipated by the sfq components is below 50 nw .",
    "scalable solutions for a multi - qubit system with large power dissipation require two - chip ( hybrid ) designs with separate active cooling of the qubit and the sfq chips .",
    "an alternative strategy based on complete revision of the sfq approach ( e.g. , development of reversible sfq circuits ) should be considered as a longer term goal .",
