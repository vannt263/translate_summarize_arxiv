    "in the previous years , the attempts to investigate in a systematic way the different classes of modified gravity theories have been very successful . the theories of galileon , describing models involving one scalar field coupling to general relativity , have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "their most general extension has been especially proven in ref .",
    "this approach to modify gravity has found multiple applications in cosmology , for example on the subject of dark energy @xcite or inflation @xcite .",
    "it has even be shown that some galileon models are as compatible with cosmological data as the @xmath1cdm model @xcite .",
    "several attempts have then be done to investigate theories going beyond the standard single scalar galileon theory .",
    "for example , the possibility to build vector galileon models with vector fields propagating three degrees of freedom have been investigated @xcite , as well as their first cosmological applications @xcite .",
    "the possibility to have several scalar fields has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "such models are called multi - galileon ones , and can be considered for arbitrary internal indices , as well as for multi - galileons in given group representations . a formulation of what would be the most general multi - galileon theory has been especially discussed in refs .",
    "however , it has been shown that some models are not included in this general action previously derived , for example the multi - field dbi galileons  @xcite .",
    "additional terms have also been derived e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for arbitrary @xmath2-forms or ref .",
    "@xcite for bi - galileon theory that do no enter this general class of models .",
    "all these extra terms are included in the present construction .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a class of terms satisfying the standard multi - galileon hypotheses , but which are not included in the general action of refs .",
    "these lagrangians , that we call extended multi - galileon ones , are specific to multi - galileon models , and identically vanish in the single galileon case . in a first part",
    ", we introduce these new lagrangians , and examine their different properties , including hidden symmetry properties , i.e. which can be made explicit by adding conserved currents to the lagrangians .",
    "then , in secs .  [ partfundrep ] and  [ partadjrep ] , we use the previous properties to investigate all the possible dynamics for extended multi - galileon lagrangians in the fundamental representation of a so(@xmath0 ) or su(@xmath0 ) global symmetry group , and in the adjoint representation of a su(@xmath0 ) global symmetry group .",
    "for some of these models , we also perform in parallel an exhaustive examination of all the possible lagrangians .",
    "the results of these systematic investigations , mostly given in appendices  [ appepsson ] and  [ apppartsun ] , are in complete agreement with the dynamics obtained using the complete symmetry properties of the lagrangians , which strengthens our examination .",
    "this investigation also allows us to examine the internal properties of the model , e.g. the link between the possible alternative lagrangian formulations .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "[ partconclusion ] , in particular by discussing what could be the most general multi - galileon theory , as well as the link between scalar and vector multi - galileon models .",
    "we discuss in the paper possible lagrangian terms for multi - galileon theories in flat spacetime ( that we suppose in the whole discussion four - dimensional ) .",
    "these terms are built from multi - galileon fields only ( which we also call simply multi - galileons ) , i.e. scalar fields with internal indices @xmath3 .",
    "these fields can lie in given group representations , or only be parts of generic non - linear sigma models .",
    "the multi - galileon theories satisfy the following conditions    * _ the lagrangians contain up to second order derivatives of the multi - galileons . _ * _ the lagrangians are polynomial in the second order derivatives of the multi - galileons . _ * _ the field equations contain up to second order derivatives of the multi - galileon fields . _    the third condition is necessary in order for the theory not to include ostrogradski instability  @xcite .",
    "it has been proven in ref .",
    "@xcite that the conditions * i * and * iii * imply the condition * ii*. we however let it as a hypothesis here .    the starting point for the study of such theories",
    "have been the single galileon case , which has already been examined in details  @xcite .",
    "the generalized galileon theory has been proven to be the most general one with the hypotheses given below , when considering the case of a unique scalar field  @xcite .",
    "its construction begins from the most general theory giving second order only equations of motion , i.e. lagrangians of the form @xmath4 or equivalently , up to a total derivative , @xmath5 with @xmath6 taking values between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and where @xmath9 } = \\frac{1}{(d - n)!}\\epsilon^{i_1\\cdots i_n \\sigma_1 \\cdots \\sigma_{d - n } } \\epsilon_{j_1\\cdots j_n \\sigma_1 \\cdots \\sigma_{d - n } } =    \\delta^{j_1}_{i_1 } \\cdots \\delta^{j_n}_{i_n } \\pm \\cdots , } \\label{eqdeltamult}\\ ] ] for @xmath10 running from 1 to 4 ( in a four - dimensional spacetime ) .",
    "then , multiplying those terms by an arbitrary function of @xmath11 and its first derivative still gives second order equations of motion .",
    "this is due to the fact that all the third order derivatives in the equations of motion coming from the variation of the first order derivatives in the arbitrary function and the second order derivatives in the initial galileon lagrangian will cancel out each other .",
    "indeed , both terms produce the same third order derivative contribution , but from a different number of integrations by part , one and two respectively , granting them an opposite sign ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of this property ) .",
    "multi - galileon lagrangians have been obtained in the same way .",
    "the lagrangians giving second - order equations of motion only have been first examined in refs .",
    "@xcite , and consist in adding internal indices to the galileon lagrangians of eqs .   or .",
    "one could then consider the possibility to multiply these lagrangians by an arbitrary function of the multi - galileons and their first order derivatives .",
    "however , the property of cancellation of third order derivative terms discussed in the single galileon case is not valid anymore , since the internal indices can break the symmetry between the contributions to the equations of motion coming from one or two integrations per part , respectively .",
    "thus , the way to overcome this difficulty is to ensure the necessary symmetry between these pairs of terms  @xcite . following this procedure",
    ", the related lagrangians are of the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 , and with the property that @xmath14 is symmetric in all of its indices @xmath15 . the theory spanned by these lagrangian",
    "was determined the most general one in  @xcite .",
    "however , some papers found that others terms verifying the same hypotheses * i*-*iii * are not included in these lagrangians  @xcite .",
    "one could then ask if the construction done by multiplying the lagrangians giving second order only equations of motion by such an arbitrary function , while still verifying the above conditions * i*-*iii * produce all the possible terms . indeed , including this arbitrary function which satisfies the symmetry condition introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite is a sufficient condition to include extra first order derivatives in the action , but not a necessary one .",
    "another way to incorporate additional first order derivatives to such a lagrangian while keeping second order equations of motion , if the lagrangian does not already contain more than two second order derivatives , is to use the antisymmetry of the term given in eq .  .",
    "we can indeed write the following lagrangians , introduced especially in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath16 where we let the internal indices totally free for the moment .",
    "we call these particular lagrangians extended multi - galileon ones .    due to the contraction of all derivatives terms with a prefactor of the form @xmath17 , it is straightforward to see that these lagrangians give second order equations of motion .",
    "in addition , their particular structure , implying antisymmetric properties between the internal indices , makes them different from the lagrangians of eq .  .",
    "to see this , one can consider the case of @xmath18 .",
    "terms of the same order from lagrangians of the form of eq .",
    "are @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "they have to be symmetric in all the internal indices for the first one , and all the internal indices but @xmath21 in the second , which means that no antisymmetry under the exchanges of two pairs of indices are possible .",
    "in addition , they do not vanish in the single galileon limit , whereas @xmath18 vanishes in this limit .",
    "it means that they can be obtained by adding internal indices to single galileon models , which is not the case of @xmath18 , making this last lagrangian a purely multi - galileon one .",
    "these extended lagrangians can be considered as a basis , in addition to the lagrangians giving second order only equations of motion , to build the generalized multi - galileon models .",
    "indeed , it is still possible to include an arbitrary function of @xmath3 and its first derivative in front of them , as long as one ensures that the third orders derivatives appearing in the equations of motion cancel out each other thanks to additional symmetry properties of the internal indices .",
    "note that this kind of generalized multi - galileon lagrangians was already partially written in the literature . in the following parts",
    ", we will focus on the extended multi - galileon lagrangians only .",
    "let us first consider the symmetry properties of these extended lagrangians .",
    "the properties of @xmath17 impose that the lagrangians are completely antisymmetric by exchange of the fields with @xmath22 derivatives only , as well as by exchange of the fields with @xmath23 derivatives only .",
    "they are also symmetric by exchange of the groups of fields with @xmath22 derivatives only and @xmath23 derivatives only , since the @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be exchanged without modifying the lagrangian .",
    "finally , @xmath26 is symmetric by exchange of the fields with second order derivatives . to summarize , and taking the example of @xmath27 this lagrangian is    * _ antisymmetric under the exchanges @xmath28 or @xmath29 _ , * _ symmetric under the exchange @xmath30 _ , * _ symmetric under exchange @xmath31_.    these symmetries are very restrictive , particularly for models where there are only a few internal states .",
    "for example , in the case of a bi - galileon model , and for @xmath18 , only two independent terms are possible out of the 32 initial configurations , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "another symmetry of this lagrangian can be seen indirectly , with the following property :    * _ if there is an antisymmetry between the internal indices of fields with first and second order derivatives in a lagrangian @xmath34 , this lagrangian is a total derivative . in the case of @xmath18",
    ", it would be for example an antisymmetry between fields with indices @xmath21 and @xmath35 , or @xmath36 and @xmath35 .",
    "_    let us prove it in the case of @xmath18 .",
    "for this purpose , we can consider the contraction of the internal indices with a function which contains no fields .",
    "this function can be arbitrary in a general sigma model , and has to be built from primitive invariants in the case of multi - galileons in a given group representation .",
    "this function has to verify the symmetry properties detailed previously .",
    "so , we can write @xmath37[{{\\color{red}c\\color{black}}}{{\\color{red}d\\color{black}}}]{{\\color{red}e\\color{black}}}},}\\ ] ] where the square brackets mean antisymmetrization .",
    "suppose that in addition to these symmetry properties , there is an antisymmetry of @xmath38 under the exchange @xmath39 , without loss of generality . in this case , @xmath38 is antisymmetric on the group of indices @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , the antisymmetry under the exchange @xmath41 is forced , since the symmetric configuration always vanishes .",
    "then , the only possibility for a tensor antisymmetric under the exchanges @xmath29 and @xmath39 is to be completely antisymmetric on these three indices .",
    "it is then possible to build the following current @xmath42[{{\\color{red}c\\color{black}}}{{\\color{red}d\\color{black}}}]{{\\color{red}e\\color{black}}}}},\\ ] ] which is not vanishing if the lagrangian is not vanishing . using the symmetry properties of @xmath38 , one can compute that @xmath43[{{\\color{red}c\\color{black}}}{{\\color{red}d\\color{black}}}]{{\\color{red}e\\color{black}}}}.}\\ ] ] however , the second term vanishes , since @xmath38 is antisymmetric by exchange of the indices @xmath39 , which proves that the @xmath44 is a total derivative . another way to prove this property is by introducing the current @xmath45[{{\\color{red}c\\color{black}}}{{\\color{red}d\\color{black}}}]{{\\color{red}e\\color{black}}}}},\\ ] ] whose divergence gives three times the expected lagrangian .",
    "this current clearly shows that it is the contribution totally antisymmetric here in @xmath40 which is a total derivative , since this is the only one which gives a non - vanishing @xmath46 .",
    "an similar calculation can be done for the other extended multi - galileon lagrangians .",
    "this allows us to prove another symmetry property , which will turn very useful in the following :    * _ the extended multi - galileon lagrangians with a non trivial dynamics can be written up to a total derivative in a form that has a complete symmetry under the exchange of the internal indices of one field with a single @xmath47 derivative , one field with a single @xmath48 derivative , and all the fields with a @xmath49 derivative , and no other fields . without loss of generality , we can assume this symmetry between the fields with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( if it exists ) derivatives in the lagrangians of eq .  . in this form",
    ", the other indices of fields with one derivatives can be symmetrized by pairs , e.g. the fields with @xmath54 and @xmath55 derivatives , and so on . _",
    "two independent proofs of this property are given in appendix  [ appproofb ] .",
    "an important remark is that property  * b * does not claim that the lagrangians which have a non - trivial dynamic possess these particular symmetry properties , but that they can be written as lagrangians with these symmetry properties plus antisymmetric total derivatives . in other words ,",
    "the complete symmetry of a lagrangian can be hidden by total derivatives .",
    "it is linked to the fact that starting from such a symmetric lagrangian , it is always possible to add conserved currents which do not possess these symmetries . on the other hand",
    ", this property shows that it is sufficient to look for lagrangians which have these complete symmetry properties .    finally ,",
    "a last property of these extended multi - galileon lagrangians can be proven :    * _ the equations of motion for the extended multi - galileon lagrangians are total derivatives .",
    "_    it can be shown from the fact that these lagrangians contain only derivatives of the scalar fields .",
    "the equations of motion have thus the following form , @xmath56 \\mathcal{l}^{\\text{ext}}_n= \\partial_\\mu j^{\\mu{{\\color{red}\\alpha\\color{black}}}}}\\ ] ] this last property is useful to verify the consistency of calculations .",
    "indeed , the generalized galileon actions obtained by multiplying the extended multi - galileon lagrangians by functions of @xmath3 and its first derivative do not verify this property anymore .      in the following , to reduce the possible contractions between the internal indices",
    ", we will work with multi - galileons lying in a given group representation .",
    "we suppose that this group transformation describes a global symmetry of the model , in an effective field theory point of view .",
    "thus , we assume that the lagrangians behave as singlets under the action of this symmetry group .",
    "the representations we will take as examples will be the fundamental representation of a so(@xmath0 ) or su(@xmath0 ) symmetry group , and the adjoint representation of a su(@xmath0 ) symmetry group .    in these representations , it is possible to write the lagrangians as a contraction between the terms given in eq .   and a prefactor term which is built from primitive invariants of the multi - galileon representation only .",
    "it gives for example @xmath57 for the first of them , with @xmath58 built from primitive invariants .",
    "for example , in the fundamental representation of a so(@xmath0 ) symmetry group in a vector representation , the primitive invariants are only @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the adjoint representation of a su(@xmath0 )",
    "symmetry group described with one - tensors @xmath3 for @xmath61 , the primitive invariants are @xmath59 , @xmath62 the structure constants tensor , and @xmath63 the completely symmetric invariant ( for @xmath64 ) @xcite .",
    "these results will be discussed in details in secs .",
    "[ partfundrep ] and  [ partadjrep ] . in the following discussion",
    ", we will label the representations with only one internal index , to simplify the notation .",
    "note than when computing the equations of motion , there is a derivation with respect to a field .",
    "it means that the equations of motion will be in the conjugate representation of this field ) are complex conjugate and in pair ( for @xmath65 ) @xcite . ] .",
    "so , the equations of motion will be linear combinations of terms with one free index in the primitive invariant part , that we will label @xmath66 , yielding @xmath67 where we did not give explicitly the other contractions between group indices , and where in the whole paper the equations of motion read @xmath68 .",
    "note that the equations of motion for @xmath18 and @xmath26 do not reduce to multi - galileon lagrangians , since they are not in a singlet representation of the symmetry group .    to strengthen the examination of possible lagrangians",
    ", we will also proceed to a systematic search of possible terms without using property  * b*. to study the possible lagrangians that can be written , one has to consider the possible contractions between the independent primitive invariant prefactors and the lagrangians given in eq .  .",
    "thanks to the symmetries of these lagrangians and to property  * a * , only few possibilities will remain in most cases .",
    "this makes useful the following property :    * _ if for a given primitive invariant prefactor , it is possible to write only one non - vanishing lagrangian @xmath69 which is not a total derivative by contracting this prefactor to a @xmath70 , and if it is possible to write a non vanishing current by taking off one of the derivatives of a second order derivative contribution in this lagrangian , then this lagrangian is a total derivative . _    to prove this result , it is sufficient to consider that the total derivative obtained when taking the divergence of the previously formed current only reduces to contractions of the given primitive invariant prefactor with @xmath70",
    ". thus , the divergence of this conserved current will give @xmath69 and lagrangians which are either vanishing or total derivatives .",
    "it shows that @xmath69 is also a total derivative . using the same method",
    ", one can show that one of these currents associated to @xmath71 .",
    "its divergence gives @xmath71 and additional lagrangians .",
    "either all these lagrangians vanish or are total derivatives , either they contain @xmath72 . in the first case",
    ", @xmath71 is a total derivative , in the second case , @xmath71 implies the same dynamics as @xmath72 . ]",
    "* _ if for a given primitive invariant prefactor , it is possible to write only two non - vanishing lagrangians @xmath73 which are not total derivatives by contracting this prefactor with a @xmath70 , and if it is possible to write a non vanishing current by taking off one of the derivatives of a second order derivative term of one of these lagrangians , then they imply at most one non - trivial dynamics .",
    "_    both these properties will be useful in the following .",
    "in this section , we consider real multi - galileon fields which transform in the fundamental representation of a so(@xmath0 ) global symmetry group .",
    "they are labeled as vectors with group indices going from @xmath7 to @xmath0 .",
    "the action of the group on them corresponds to the defining rotation matrices of so(@xmath0 ) : @xmath74 the representation being self - conjugate and real , the upper and lower indices are equivalent , and can be exchanged with the flat metric @xmath59 .",
    "the only primitive invariants of the orthogonal group in this representation are the kronecker delta @xmath59 and the levi - civita tensor @xmath75 .",
    "following property  * b * and keeping in mind the lagrangians of eq .",

    "it allows us to verify that the lagrangian introduced in sec .",
    "[ partintroson ] describes the only possible dynamic for extended multi - galileons in this representation .",
    "it also allows us to describe in more details the alternative formulations of the model and their properties .",
    "let us first consider the contractions with @xmath59 only .",
    "these contractions are only possible with @xmath26 , since it is the only lagrangian with an even number of fields .",
    "then , taking into account the symmetries of this lagrangian , the only two independent non - vanishing contractions are @xmath85 following property  * e * , it is straightforward to show that they are related by a total derivative . indeed , taking @xmath86 we get @xmath87 in addition ,",
    "these two lagrangians can be related to @xmath88 , yielding @xmath89 using eqs .   and",
    ", we see that all three lagrangians imply the same dynamics .",
    "these alternative lagrangians illustrate the discussion following property  * b * , since they have a non - trivial dynamic and do not explicitly have the set of four indices which are totally symmetric under exchange as described in property  * b*. however , this symmetry can be recovered as expected by adding the total derivative of a current with a set of three indices totally symmetric under exchange , in that case the lower indices @xmath21 , @xmath90 and @xmath36 of the current @xmath91 .",
    "one can note that the most symmetric version of the lagrangians is not necessarily the simplest one .",
    "for example , the equation of motion given in eq .   is easier to obtain from the alternative formulations given in eq .  .",

    "this concludes the complete investigation of possible lagrangian terms for extended multi - galileons in the fundamental representation of a so(@xmath0 ) global symmetry group , showing that only one dynamic is possible , described by the lagrangian of eq .  .",
    "we discuss here the case of complex multi - galileon fields which transform in the fundamental representation of a su(@xmath0 ) global symmetry group . in this case",
    ", we have to consider also its complex conjugate representation . for su(2 ) , both representations are equivalent , but the fundamental representation is pseudo - real",
    ". then , there exists no basis in which the action of the group elements on the fundamental representation and its complex conjugate representation are equal , and it is thus better to distinguish them . for su(@xmath0 ) with @xmath65 , on which we focus from now on , the complex conjugate representations are inequivalent , and have to be distinguished .",
    "we use vector notations with upper indices for the fundamental representation , labeling the multi - galileon fields by @xmath3 with @xmath21 from @xmath7 to @xmath0 .",
    "the complex conjugates of these fields are labeled with lower indices , i.e. denoting @xmath92 . with these notations , they transform under the action of the defining matrices of su(@xmath0 ) as @xmath93 it is important to keep in mind that lower and upper indices label two different representations , and can not be exchanged by the application of a group metric , as in the so(@xmath0 ) case .",
    "there are three primitive invariants in this representation , the kronecker delta @xmath94 and two levi - civita tensors @xmath75 and @xmath95 .    to obtain the possible non - trivial lagrangians satisfying property  * b * in this case",

    "case , it is only possible to build such a term for rank 4 , by symmetrizing two kronecker deltas .",
    "this symmetrization has to be done independently of the representations of the fields .",
    "the symmetric tensor thus yields @xmath96 where h.c .",
    "means hermitian conjugate , the hermitian conjugate of @xmath94 being obviously @xmath97 . in this equation",
    ", one has to pay attention that the lower indices have to be contracted with @xmath3 fields , while the upper indices have to be contracted with complex conjugate @xmath98 fields . here , the alphabetical order merely is an indication of the position of the field in the lagrangian .",
    "then , the only possible lagrangian is @xmath99 whose equations of motion are similar but more involved than the equations of motion of the real case .",
    "looking for alternative formulations , one has to pay attention that it is a priori possible to build more lagrangians in the su(@xmath0 ) case than in the so(@xmath0 ) case .",
    "first , the necessity to distinguish fields with upper and lower indices allows us to write several lagrangians which reduce to the ones of the so(@xmath0 ) case in the limit where the fields become real ( i.e. with a real representation in which complex conjugate fields are equivalent ) .",
    "for example , the two following lagrangians to @xmath100 are written with expressions which are already real , thanks to their symmetry properties .",
    "we however prefer to write them explicitly with the h.c .",
    "contribution , to remind that they are built from complex conjugate fields .",
    "in addition , it simplifies the calculations when dealing with other lagrangians which do not have this property , as it is the case e.g. for @xmath101 ] @xmath102 reduce to @xmath103 of eq .   in the real case .",
    "similarly , three different lagrangians can be written in the su(@xmath0 ) case which reduce to @xmath104 of eq .  .",
    "then , dealing with two representations which are not equivalent , it is also possible to write down lagrangians which would vanish due to symmetry considerations in the so(@xmath0 ) limit .",
    "one can for example consider @xmath105 which identically vanishes in the real limit .",
    "this indicates that the alternative formulations of @xmath106 are a priori more numerous than in the real case .      for the extended multi - galileon models in the fundamental representation of a global so(@xmath0 ) symmetry group , the only non - trivial dynamics is given by @xmath107 equivalent lagrangians",

    "there is also one possible non - trivial dynamics in the case of the fundamental representation of a global su(@xmath0 ) symmetry group , where the only possible dynamics is described by the lagrangian given in eq .  .",
    "however , more equivalent lagrangians can a priori be written in this case .",
    "this whole section showed that as discussed previously , the properties of the extended multi - galileon models are very constraining and allow us to build only a few independent non - trivial dynamics , even if it is possible to write a lot of non vanishing lagrangians .",
    "properly used , these properties drastically simplify the research of possible non - trivial lagrangian terms .",
    "in this part , we consider multi - galileon fields in the adjoint representation of a global su(@xmath0 ) symmetry group .",
