    "the existence of high - order gravity - mode ( g - mode ) oscillations in slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars , which are core - hydrogen burning stars with mass between roughly 3 and 7m@xmath0 ( spbs hereafter , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was established more than two decades ago , prior to understanding their excitation mechanism .",
    "we now know that these oscillations are driven by the heat - mechanism associated with the opacity bump due to iron - group elements in the stellar envelope @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of g - mode period spacings associated with those standing waves as predicted from theory @xcite and required for asteroseismology of such stars , remained impossible from the ground , even after carefully planned long - term dedicated campaigns @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the low amplitudes of g - modes and is also made difficult because the periods of gravity modes in massive stars are of order days and these timescales have strong contamination by daily aliases in the amplitude spectra of ground - based photometry and high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "gravity - mode asteroseismology of spbs only saw its birth due to the uninterrupted high - precision space photometry assembled with the corot and _ kepler _ missions .",
    "these data led to the detection of period spacings caused by dipole modes of consecutive radial order and offered the mode identification necessary for seismic modelling @xcite .    while heat - driven g - mode oscillations in spbs are strictly periodic and have a well - known and quantifiable effect on observed time - series photometry and spectral line - profile variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effect of waves excited stochastically by core convection @xcite on such observations is relatively unknown .",
    "this lack of observational diagnostics connected with igw is particularly relevant in the context of the variability of o - type stars , in which heat - driven modes are not excited , while their large convective cores likely drive igw efficiently .",
    "this work is therefore focused on the search for igw driven by core convection in photometric and spectroscopic observations of a few carefully selected observed o - type stars .",
    "such signatures are important because the existence of these waves could point to enhanced angular momentum transport and chemical mixing and hence , guide inclusion of these processes into future theoretical models .",
    "there have been relatively few theoretical predictions for the spectra and amplitudes of igw excited by core convection in massive stars .",
    "on the one hand , @xcite provided the first 3d simulations of the core convection for a 2m@xmath0 star but these only covered the inner 30% in radius and hence , omitted much of the wave propagation region .",
    "more recent theoretical models do consider the entire radius of the star but are limited to one - dimension ( 1d ) , neglect rotation and must make assumptions about the nature of convection and convective - overshoot @xcite .",
    "generally those theoretical models assume reynolds stresses in the convection zone that generate waves with a predominant frequency given by the convective turnover frequency and with frequency and wavelength spectra dictated by the assumed properties of the turbulence .",
    "the amplitudes of the waves are determined by the efficiency with which energy is transferred from convection to waves , and is highly dependent on assumptions about the convective - radiative interface . despite these shortcomings ,",
    "the theoretical spectra of igw predicted by @xcite and @xcite are consistent with the observed frequency ranges of variable ob stars .",
    "however , their amplitudes vary significantly and appear to be inconsistent with observations .",
    "for example , the amplitudes predicted in @xcite are more than an order of magnitude lower than those predicted in @xcite and even those are too small to explain the detection of stochastically excited gravito - inertial modes in hd51452 by @xcite .",
    "these theoretical models also assume that the star is non - rotating and it was shown by @xcite that the coriolis force has a severe effect on the stochastic excitation of waves and hence , their surface amplitudes . in reality , the waves in stars are mixed gravito - inertial waves and this should be accounted for in theoretical predictions of surface wave amplitudes . beyond their effect on photometric and spectroscopic observations , these mixed type waves",
    "likely lead to substantial angular momentum transport @xcite and may be responsible for the be star phenomenon @xcite , which could not be fully captured in earlier 1d analytic models",
    ". clearly , observational constraints on the detection of igw , as well as more realistic multi - d predictions of their observational signature , would be highly beneficial .    here",
    ", in order to make comparisons between theoretical predictions of igw in massive stars and observations , we use the velocity spectra from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) numerical simulations of convectively driven waves in a 3m@xmath0 star , described in @xcite .",
    "while having many shortcomings ( dimensionality , degree of turbulence ) , these simulations provide a more realistic benchmark for comparison because they self - consistently generate the waves by convection , include all non - linearity and rotation . in order to carry out such simulations some sacrifices had to be made .",
    "perhaps the most relevant for the current work , are that the simulations used an enhanced thermal diffusivity for numerical stability and considered only one mass . in order to compensate for the enhanced thermal damping of the waves on their journey to the stellar surface , the waves were driven harder by using an ( equivalently ) enhanced heat flux . while this is not a perfect representation of the waves , it is likely the best that can be done with current computational resources .",
    "because of this shortcoming , wave amplitudes produced by these simulations should be treated with some caution .",
    "furthermore , the simulations only considered one mass and it is well known that the igw frequencies depend weakly on the mass of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . repeating the simulations for various masses and evolutionary stages",
    "is beyond the scope of the current work , given that each 2d simulation takes approximately a hundred thousand processor hours for _ one _ set of parameters ( mass , age , rotation , diffusion coefficients , luminosity ) .",
    "such a simulation study will be the subject of future research . in order to compensate for the enhanced thermal diffusion ,",
    "the convective heat flux adopted in @xcite was typically 10@xmath1 times higher than that of a 3m@xmath0 star , so the predicted spectra of igw might appropriately resemble those of @xmath230m@xmath0 stars since the wave spectrum is predominantly determined by properties of the convection , but this is yet to be investigated . in order to account for variations in mass with respect to the 3m@xmath0 and for the too high convective flux adopted for the currently available numerical simulations , we apply one multiplicative factor ( an unknown parameter ) to scale the amplitudes of the waves and another one to rescale frequencies for comparisons with real stars , as discussed in more detail below . despite these caveats",
    ", we expect that the overall characteristics and _ shape _ of the predicted frequency spectra should offer a realistic representation of the effect of igw on observables .    in fig.[tami ] , we show velocity spectra for three cases from @xcite : a non - rotating star , a rigidly rotating star with an initial rotational frequency of 1.100d@xmath3 , and a differentially rotating star whose core rotates initially with a factor 1.5 times faster than its envelope , the surface rotational frequency being 0.275d@xmath3 .",
    "these cases correspond with the simulations labelled as u1 , u8 , and d11 in table1 of @xcite , to which we refer for details . using a radius from the prototypical spb kic10526294 with @xmath4m@xmath0 and @xmath5r@xmath0 @xcite ,",
    "the two rotating models give initial equatorial rotation velocities of 31 ( non - rigid , d11 ) and 123kms@xmath3 ( rigid , u8 ) .",
    "the velocity spectra were obtained after more than 100 rotational cycles ( for u8 and d11 ) , in a layer near the stellar surface at 99% in radius , and the tangential velocity is an average over @xmath6 $ ] . in fig.[tami ] , it can be seen that the vertical velocity is many orders of magnitude smaller than the tangential velocity , as is expected for gravity waves .",
    "fig.[tami ] also clearly illustrates that non - rigid rotation ( d11 ) inside the star shifts the power to lower frequencies compared to the rigidly or non - rotating cases .",
    "given that the few estimates of core - to - envelope rotation of massive stars point to nonrigid rotation with a factor 2 to 5 faster core than envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use d11 for comparisons with observations .    beyond the uncertainties in wave amplitudes and frequencies discussed above , it is not entirely clear how to convert velocity spectra , of the type seen in fig.[tami ] , to brightness variations , as observed . to address this",
    ", we can use the _ known amplitude ratio _ of photometric brightness variability due to heat - driven g - mode oscillations in spbs to velocity variations measured using spectral line diagnostics in the same stars .",
    "the case of convectively driven waves is , of course , different as these waves have shorter lifetimes and some are breaking leading to turbulence . on the other hand ,",
    "the heat - driven prograde or retrograde g modes of spbs correspond with trapped internal resonant gravity waves .",
    "the 2d simulations produce convectively driven resonant gravity waves with amplitudes in the same range as the non - resonant waves . therefore ,",
    "in absence of any better conversion , we assume that the brightness fluctuation signatures due to velocity variations from igw behave similarly to those from heat - driven g modes in terms of amplitude ratios of photometric and spectroscopic observables measured at one instance in time . under this assumption",
    ", we use the carefully _ measured _ amplitude ratios of @xmath7 of g modes to convert tangential velocity spectra to brightness spectra .",
    "the measured amplitude ratios for the g - modes in the single spb pulsators considered in @xcite have values between roughly 1 and 10mmag/(kms@xmath3 ) , as deduced from the light curves in the @xmath8 band and from the centroid velocity @xmath9 derived from high - resolution high signal - to - noise time - series spectroscopy ( see chapter6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for a definition ) .",
    "below , we use these observational results to scale wave amplitudes in the simulations for comparison with observations .    in the following sections , we first provide observational evidence of the occurence of igw in @xmath10mag space photometry of three young unevolved o - type stars measured with the corot satellite .",
    "we then predict line - profile variations due to simulated igw in order to evaluate if igw can provide an alternative explanation of macroturbulent spectral line broadening , in addition to coherent g - mode oscillations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+   +    the most , corot , and _ kepler _ missions revealed a much larger diversity in variability of ob - type stars at @xmath10mag level than anticipated prior to the era of high - precision space photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for an update ) .",
    "while most of the variability is well understood as due to heat - driven stellar oscillations , rotational modulation , magnetic activity , mass loss , various sorts of binarity , or a combination of all those processes , the `` red noise '' power excess found in the amplitude spectra of three o stars , remains unexplained @xcite .    as is common in the study of heat - driven oscillations ,",
    "we represent the effect of igw by means of amplitude spectra , where we focus on the @xmath11-averaged tangential velocity ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure[ostars ] shows the observed amplitude spectra resulting from brightness measurements assembled by the corot mission for three o stars , with surface rotation frequencies of 0.144d@xmath3 for hd46150 ( top panel ) , 0.249d@xmath3 for hd46223 ( middle panel ) , and 0.084d@xmath3 for hd46966 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "these spectra are presented in mmag and have been reproduced from @xcite , who found them to reveal frequencies connected with phenomena of short lifetimes ( order of hours to days ) .",
    "we compare those observed spectra ( grey line in fig.[ostars ] ) with the simulated igw spectra shown in fig.[tami ] for the non - rigidly rotating case d11 ( red line in fig.[ostars ] ) .",
    "we have applied a correction factor of @xmath20.75 to the frequencies to account for the factor @xmath210 higher mass between the observed and simulated stars , following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table1 ) .",
    "we realise that the propagation cavity of the igw changes somewhat as a function of mass and age , which may imply that such a simple scaling is not optimal . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum of igw is dominantly determined by the convective flux and less so by the shape of the brnt - visl frequency .",
    "for this reason , we consider a simple scaling to be the best approach while awaiting future 2d/3d simulations for various stellar masses and evolutionary stages .",
    "we further applied a factor of 2 , 3 , and 1.5 , respectively to the igw amplitude spectra ( shown in red in fig.[ostars ] ) to convert between simulated tangential velocity and brightness , consistent with the observed range of amplitude ratios from @xmath7 for the heat - driven modes of spbs .",
    "the lowest frequencies , below 1d@xmath3 , are not reproduced by the simulations .",
    "this could be due to too low a stellar mass and/or too low level of differential rotation and/or the too simplified scalings we have adopted .",
    "however , the overall resemblance is good in terms of frequency structure .",
    "this interpretation of the `` red noise '' power excess as due to igw is currently the only theoretical explanation that provides amplitude spectra whose _ shape _ is in agreement with those observed in the three o stars .",
    "high resolution time series spectroscopy of confirmed g - mode pulsators show line - profile variations ( lpvs ) of a complex nature but such data is only available for a handful of spbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in absence of systematic time - resolved lpv studies of gravity - mode pulsators among ob - type stars",
    ", @xcite performed simulations to show that the collective effect of numerous _ heat - driven _ g - modes leads to lpvs that mimic the effect of a macroturbulent velocity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "more recently , it was shown from observed lpvs that even one mode or spot can give rise to spectral line broadening in b stars consistent with considerable @xmath13 values @xcite .",
    "these findings indicate that pulsational velocities due to heat - driven g - modes could explain the occurrence of macroturbulence along most of the upper main sequence , except for the highest - mass core - hydrogen burning o stars which do not show heat - driven modes @xcite .",
    "however , they do show a power excess of frequencies with short lifetime ( fig.[ostars ] ) , which we demonstrated may be the signature of igw .",
    "it is then reasonable to investigate whether igw can lead to lpvs in these stars .    using stellar parameters and frequencies of hd46150 @xcite and velocity fluctuations given in the d11 simulation ( scaled by a factor of 2 as in the red curve in the upper panel of fig.[ostars ] ) we produced lpvs for its oiii5922  line following the method outlined in ( *",
    "* chapter 6 ) . in doing so",
    ", we used the radial and tangential velocity fluctuations produced in the simulations ( fig.[tami ] ) as radial and tangential amplitude and we adopted a longitudinal and latitudinal dependence according to dipolar prograde spherical harmonics seen under an inclination angle of 60@xmath14 .",
    "this procedure produced the lpvs shown in the left panel of fig.[lpvs ] .",
    "since there are no observed lpvs for these o - type stars , for comparison we show simulated lpvs for the spb star kic7760680 , representative of its mgii4481  line and based upon its identified heat - driven modes detected in the _ kepler _ data . in order to generate these lpvs ,",
    "we have taken the frequency , amplitude , and phase values from table1 in @xcite .",
    "the resulting lpvs are shown in the right panel of fig.[lpvs ] .",
    "we find that the velocity fields due to igw that give good agreement with the corot photometric data ( fig.[ostars ] ) also lead to lpvs that are quite similar to those produced by heat - driven gravity modes of kic7760680 and that the spectral line wings of both stars are predicted to be broadened compared to the case of rotational line broadening alone , indicative of macroturbulence .",
    "of course , we have presented just one set of simulated line profiles based on particular assumptions about the nature of igw in terms of amplitude and mode type , but these simulations are in agreement with the need for macroturbulence to fit the profiles of hd46150 , as found by ( * ? ? ? * @xmath15kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "our simulations also show that the anticipated lpvs resulting from the chosen angular velocity dependence and inclination angle are tiny in velocity space ( @xmath16-axis in fig.[lpvs ] ) while better visible in relative flux changes ( @xmath17-axis ) , i.e.  the profiles remain fairly symmetric and fluctuate in relative flux level .",
    "so actual future detection of time - variability in the oiii5922  line of hd46150 will require very high - resolution , high signal - to - noise time series spectroscopy in order to observe the fluctuations in the broadening of the spectral line over time , with respect to a time - averaged profile .",
    "we have shown that the 2d simulations of igw by @xcite give rise to averaged tangential velocity spectra in agreement with measurements of ampitude spectra of flux variations in three mid - o type stars that do not exhibit heat - driven oscillations .",
    "our simulations of lpvs based on the velocity spectra due to igw reveal that such waves can give rise to detectable time - dependent line broadening similar to that observed in spbs .",
    "igw thus offer a viable explanation for the occurrence of macroturbulence in the hottest main - sequence stars of spectral type o , which are not subject to heat - driven oscillation modes and/or strictly periodic rotational modulation due to surface spots .",
    "given the shortcomings of the numerical simulations , it is remarkable that they match the observations within factors of two in both frequency and amplitudes .",
    "this provides hope that numerical simulations may be able to capture the gross properties of waves in stars and that more sophisticated simulations will be able to make comparisons more robust .",
    "given our results , it is worthwhile to search for signatures of igw in the residual light curves prewhitened for the detected heat - driven mode frequencies for all ob stars observed by the _ kepler _ and corot missions , keeping in mind the recent finding that many of the frequencies found in the amplitude spectra of gravity - mode pulsators are combination frequencies ( possibly due to nonlinear mode coupling ) of heat - driven modes @xcite .",
    "however , it should be possible to distinguish between those combination frequencies generated by heat - driven g - modes and the signatures of igw since igw have short lifetimes leading to frequency features with broad wings in the fourier transform , while combinations frequencies due to heat - driven modes with infinite lifetimes reveal delta - peaks in the frequency spectra . while we provide this interpretation of the nature of macroturbulence in o stars , an independent spectroscopic study on the nature of macroturbulence",
    "has been initiated by @xcite .    in the near future",
    ", we also plan to gather new photometric data with the refurbished _",
    "kepler _ mission , baptised k2 @xcite , accompanied by high - resolution high - precision spectroscopic time series .",
    "such a combination of data would allow us to test our findings and to provide a large enough sample of ob - type stars in all evolutionary phases to test the occurrence of igw across the evolution of the most massive stars .",
    "part of the research included in this manuscript was based on funding from the research council of kuleuven , belgium under grant goa/2013/012 .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments which improved this manuscript ."
