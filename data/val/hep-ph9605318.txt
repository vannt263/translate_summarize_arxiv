    "there are several higher dimensional operators that can be used to evaluate structure from a theory beyond the standard model@xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the time - honored anomalous magnetic moment as the indicator @xcite , applied to the quark - gluon vertex , or the anomalous chromomagnetic moment .",
    "several papers have been written analyzing the contribution of such a moment to the top production cross section@xcite . in this paper , we assume such a moment could apply to any or all of the mainly annihilated , scattered or produced quarks other than the top quark . the results of this will be different from those of the four - fermion contact interaction operators , and should also be included in evaluations of possible structure .",
    "along with the exchange of a spin 3/2 excited quark state@xcite , the @xmath5 dependence and angular two - jet behavior could help further limit or establish a composite mechanism , or new interactions from higher mass scales . the same theory that gives an anomalous chromomagnetic moment",
    "may also give a four - fermion contact interaction , but here we only analyse the anomalous moment mechanism in a general context . for a complete analysis of all color current contributions in a particular model ,",
    "we refer to the recent analysis of the minimal supersymmetric standard model@xcite .",
    "the key point in our analysis is that the anomalous moment term @xmath6 , when compared to the dirac current @xmath7 , grows at high @xmath5 as @xmath8 .    in the top production papers , gluon fusion or quark fusion to a virtual gluon",
    "are calculated to produce the @xmath9 pair . here",
    "we include all quark gluon hadronic processes since quarks commonly present in protons and antiprotons could have the small anomalous moments .    since next - to - leading order qcd corrections have not been calculated for this general set of anomalous moment processes , to compare with the data we follow the cdf@xcite procedure of calculating the ratio of the theory with structure divided by lowest order qcd and comparing it with the ratio of data divided by nlo qcd .",
    "we find that an anomalous chromomagnetic coefficient @xmath10 tev@xmath1 fits the cdf rise , and would be roughly upper bounded by @xmath11 tev@xmath1 , and lower bounded by @xmath12 tev@xmath1 .",
    "the central value for the rise in cdf is not directly supported by the d0@xcite data , but is within the one sigma systematic energy calibration error curve for d0 , which rises to 120% at @xmath13 gev",
    ".    we use @xmath14 since in the general case the internal diagram or dynamics might not involve the light external quark , and a new physics model calculation will give @xmath14 directly .",
    "the use of the breakup into a vector current ( @xmath7 ) and an anomalous chromomagnetic moment term ( @xmath15 ) includes all anomalous moment vertex corrections in @xmath14 including those of qcd .",
    "however , at the very large momentum transfers we are considering here , there are form factors on the qcd vertex corrections making up the anomalous chromomagnetic moment either for virtual gluons or for high @xmath5 virtual quarks ( `` sidewise form factors''@xcite ) which will damp like ( @xmath16 ) and become irrelevant . at some @xmath17 the anomalous moment from new or composite interactions will also evidence a form factor .",
    "that is automatically included in the analysis by considering @xmath18 a function of @xmath17 , but in the comparison to the data we do not need to invoke that dependence yet .",
    "we test whether an anomalous magnetic moment equal to the anomalous chromomagnetic moment possibly indicated here would be in conflict with the @xmath19 accuracy at lep , and find it would not be .    due to discrepancies in the total hadronic cross sections for charm and bottom production at lep and sld , @xmath20 and @xmath3",
    ", we also find a separate range for either the charm or bottom quark only having an anomalous chromomagnetic moment , using the quark - antiquark production cross sections .",
    "the range for the cdf data is @xmath21 tev@xmath1 .",
    "we note that if the @xmath3 discrepancy is accounted for by an anomalous magnetic moment , it is the same order of magnitude as the anomalous chromomagnetic moment found here .",
    "@xmath22 is not inconsistent with this interpretation and rules out one of two possible anomalous magnetic moment values . for comparison with results from the top quark total cross section from ref .",
    "@xcite , we note from their fig .",
    "3 , using present cdf and d0 data on @xmath23 , that @xmath24 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath25 tev@xmath1 , and is better than the inclusive jet limits for the @xmath26 or @xmath27 quark alone calculated here .",
    "the top gluon fusion production@xcite with anomalous chromomagnetic moments has already been calculated .",
    "we use the simplifications of these for the case of zero quark mass in the various channels in which quark - quark - gluon - gluon processes occur . for completeness",
    "we repeat these formulas here for the massless case along with the massless qcd contribution .",
    "we also present here the result with anomalous chromomagnetic moments for quark - antiquark annihilation and scattering to the same quark - antiquark with interference , and its crossed quark - quark scattering .",
    "we then present the cross sections for different quarks scattering and annihilating .",
    "the cross sections are even in powers of @xmath14 due to the zero quark mass limit being used .",
    "this is because at zero mass only gamma matrices occur in the qcd trace and substitution of an anomalous moment @xmath28 term for a @xmath7 would give an odd number of gamma matrices and resulting in a zero trace , unless accompanied by an additional @xmath28 term . in other terms , at zero quark mass , there is no interference between helicity conserving and helicity flip processes : helicity conserving ones have either no anomalous moment terms or two such terms ; helicity flip ones have one anomalous moment for each helicity flipped quark line , and this gets squared in the cross section .",
    "neglect of the mass in a propagator term could give an error of order @xmath29 in the amplitude at @xmath30 gev , or @xmath31 in the cross section .",
    "the well known result@xcite for gluon - gluon scattering is @xmath32    for quark - antiquark to gluon - gluon@xcite the cross section is @xmath33 for gluon - gluon to quark - antiquark we use the above replacing the coefficient @xmath34 by @xmath35 , for either the quark or antiquark being observed .    for gluon - quark to gluon - quark with",
    "the gluon observed ( or gluon - antiquark to gluon - antiquark ) the cross section is @xmath36 for gluon - quark to gluon - quark with the quark observed ( or gluon - antiquark to gluon - antiquark ) we interchange @xmath37 with @xmath38 in the above equation .      for quark - antiquark to the same quark - antiquark including t channel exchange as well as s channel annihilation with their interference , and observing the quark we have @xmath39 for the above process observing the antiquark , we interchange @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the above formula . for identical quarks scattering to the same indentical quarks , we interchange @xmath40 and @xmath38 in the above equation , and add a factor of 1/2 for the indentical final state quarks .    for a quark - antiquark annihilation to a virtual gluon creating a different quark - antiquark pair , as in charm and bottom production , summing over identical cross - sections for either quark or antiquark observed ( which will later be multiplied by 4 for four",
    "other light quarks being created ) we have for the s - channel gluon exchange @xmath41 for @xmath42 observing the final quark we have for the t - channel gluon exchange @xmath43 for observing the final antiquark , we use the above equation with @xmath37 and @xmath38 exchanged .",
    "for @xmath44 to @xmath44 observing the quark we use the above formula and interchange @xmath40 and @xmath38 in the large parenthesis .",
    "for @xmath44 to @xmath44 observing @xmath45 , we interchange @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the large parenthesis of the above formula .",
    "the possibility of anomalous magnetic moments of quarks appearing at lep and sld at the @xmath46 peak and their forward - backward asymmetry has been considered@xcite . here",
    "we just get values to indicate the order of magnitude , refering the reader to the more careful and complete analyses by t.g .",

    "the error on @xmath68 is about 6% , and it is 11% below theory .",
    "the correction of the anomalous moment only lowers theory by @xmath69% .",
    "our calculated cdf jet cross - sections do not depend on the sign of @xmath70 , and for the case of only the @xmath26 quark having the anomalous chromomagnetic moment @xmath71 tev@xmath1 is not inconsistent with the @xmath72 anomalous magnetic moment since there will be a numerical factor depending on how the electric and color charges are distributed among the internal constituents with different masses .    for the case",
    "where all quarks except top are given the anomalous chromomagnetic moment , allowing an equal anomalous magnetic moment for each , we find changes in @xmath73 of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , corresponding to the @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath12 tev@xmath1 cases , respectively .",
    "this is at most a one @xmath79 discrepancy since the fractional error@xcite on @xmath80 is @xmath81 .",
    "in calculating the jet transverse energy distributions , we have used the parton distribution functions mrsa@xmath82@xcite . since we are taking ratios of anomalous moment contributions to strict qcd , both in leading order , most variance with pdfs drops out , only being about 2% at @xmath13 gev among the mrs set of pdfs , or between mrsa@xmath82 and cteq3 m . assuming all quarks except the top",
