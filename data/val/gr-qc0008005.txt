    "evidence for dark matter has been claimed in many different contexts .",
    "there may be _ local _ dark matter in the galactic disc , dark matter in the _ halos _ of our own and other galaxies , dark matter associated with _ clusters _ of galaxies and finally - if one believes that the total cosmological density has the critical value - smoothly distributed _ background _ dark matter .",
    "since dark matter probably takes as many different forms as visible matter , it would be simplistic to assume that all these dark matter problems have a single solution .",
    "the local dark matter is almost certainly unrelated to the other ones and , while the halo and cluster dark matter would be naturally connected in many evolutionary scenarios , there is a growing tendency to regard the unclustered background dark matter as different from the clustered component .",
    "this is because the latest supernovae measurements indicate that the cosmological expansion is accelerating , which means that the total density must be dominated by some form of  exotic \" energy with negative pressure ( possibly a cosmological constant ) .",
    "the combination of the supernovae and microwave background observations suggest that the density parameters associated with the exotic ( unclustered ) component and the ordinary ( positive pressure ) _ matter _ component are @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively ( turner 1999 ) .",
    "this is compatible with the total density parameter being @xmath2 , as expected in the inflationary scenario , but does not definitely require it .",
    "this paper will focus exclusively on the matter component of the cosmological density , with particular emphasis on the question of how much of this is baryonic and non - baryonic",
    ". we will also be interested in the relative contributions of hot and cold non - baryonic matter . as emphasized by turner ( 1999 ) ,",
    "each of these components seem to be required and it is remarkable that all their densities are within one or two orders of magnitude of each other",
    ". why this should be remains a mystery but we will not explore this further here .",
    "the main argument for both baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter comes from big bang nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "this is because the success of the standard picture in explaining the primordial light element abundances only applies if the baryon density parameter lies in the range ( copi et al .",
    "1995 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath5  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 .",
    "a few years ago the anomalously high deuterium abundance measured in some intergalactic lyman-@xmath7 clouds suggested that the nucleosynthesis value for @xmath8 could be lower than indicated by eqn ( 1 ) ( carswell et al .",
    "1994 , songaila et al .",
    "1994 , rugers & hogan 1996 , webb at al .",
    ". however , the evidence for this has always been strongly disputed ( tytler et al . 1996 ) and recent studies of the quasars q1937 and q1009 suggest that the deuterium abundance is @xmath9 ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the range @xmath10 which is much tighter than indicated by eqn ( 1 ) ( burles et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "both eqns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) suggest that the upper limit on @xmath8 is well below 1 , which implies that no baryonic candidate could provide the matter density required by large - scale structure observations .",
    "this conclusion also applies if one invokes inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis since one requires @xmath11 even in this case ( mathews et al .",
    "on the other hand , the upper limit on @xmath8 allowed by eqns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) almost certainly exceeds the density of visible baryons @xmath12 .",
    "a careful inventory by persic & salucci ( 1992 ) shows that the density in galaxies and cluster gas is @xmath13 where the last approximation applies for reasonable values of @xmath4 .",
    "a recent review by hogan ( 1999 ) has updated this estimate of @xmath12 : he replaces the factors in brackets in eqn ( 3 ) by 2.6 for spheroid stars , 0.86 for disc stars , 0.33 for neutral atomic gas , 0.30 for molecular gas and 2.6 for the ionized gas in clusters ( assuming @xmath14  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 ) .",
    "although this is still well below the nucelosynthesis bound , this may not account for all components",
    ". some of the baryons may be in an intergalactic medium ; for example , cen & ostriker ( 1999 ) find that - in the context of the  cold dark matter \" scenario - half the mass of baryons should be in warm ( @xmath15k ) intergalactic gas at the present epoch .",
    "another possibility is that the missing baryons could be in gas in groups of clusters .",
    "this has been emphasized by fukugita et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who argue that plasma in groups ( which would be too cool to have appreciable x - ray emission ) could provide all of the cosmological nucleosynthesis shortfall .",
    "indeed the review by hogan ( 1999 ) suggests that the ionized gas in groups could have a density parameter as high as @xmath16 .",
    "however , it must be stressed that this estimate is based on an extrapolation of observations of rich clusters and there is no direct evidence for this .    which of the dark matter problems identified in section 1 would be baryonic or non - baryonic ?",
    "we have already seen that the dark matter in clusters would need to be mainly non - baryonic . on the other hand ,",
    "the dark matter in galactic discs could certainly be baryonic : even if all discs have the 60% dark component envisaged for the galaxy by bahcall et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , this only corresponds to @xmath17 , well below the nucleosynthesis bound . indeed the disc dark matter would _",
    "need _ to be baryonic in order to dissipate enough to form a disc . however , the bahcall et al .",
    "claim is strongly disputed by kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) and flynn & fuchs ( 1995 ) , in fact , recent hipparcos observations suggest that the dark disc fraction is below 10% ( crz et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the more interesting question is whether the halo dark matter could be baryonic .",
    "if the milky way is typical , the density associated with halos would be @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ( uncertain ) halo radius , so the upper limit in eqn ( 1 ) implies that _ all _ the dark matter in halos could be baryonic providing @xmath20kpc .",
    "this is marginally possible for our galaxy ( fich & tremaine 1991 ) , in which case the dark baryons could be contained in the remnants of a first generation of  population iii \" stars ( carr 1994 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the  massive compact halo object \" or  macho \" scenario and has attracted considerable interest as a result of the lmc microlensing observations . even if halos are larger than @xmath21kpc , and studies of the kinematics of other spirals by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggest that they could be as large as @xmath22kpc , a considerable fraction of their mass could still be in stellar remnants .    on theoretial grounds one would expect the halo dark matter to be a _ mixture _ of wimps and machos .",
    "for since the cluster dark matter must be predominantly cold , one would expect at least some of it to clump into galactic halos .",
    "the relative densities of the two components would depend sensitively on the formation epoch of the population iii stars .",
    "if they formed pregalactically , one would expect the halo ratio to reflect the cosmological background ratio ( viz .",
    "@xmath23 ) . however , if they formed protogalactically , the ratio could be larger since the baryons could have dissipated and become more centrally concentrated than the wimps . in order to distinguish between the pregalactic and protogalactic scenarios ,",
    "it is important to gain independence evidence about the formation epoch of the putative machos . at moderate redshifts",
    "one can obtain a lower limit to the baryon density by studying lyman-@xmath7 clouds .",
    "the simulations of weinberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that the density parameter of the clouds must be at least @xmath24 at a redshift of 2 and this is already close to the upper limit given by eqn ( 1 ) . by today",
    "some of these baryons might have been transformed into a hot intergalactic medium or stars but this suggests that there was little room for any dark baryons before @xmath25 .",
    "on the other hand , we will see in section 4 that background light constraints require that any massive population iii stars must have formed much earlier than this .",
    "not only is the presence of non - baryonic dark matter required by cosmological nucleosynthesis arguments , but it also _ expected _ in the big bang scenario .",
    "this is because any particles which exist in nature must have existed profusely in the early universe once the temperature exceeded their rest mass @xmath26 .",
    "some of these particles should therefore have survived as  relics \" once the temperature fell below the value @xmath27 at which their interactions froze - out .",
    "if the particles were relativistic at freeze - out ( @xmath28 ) , their current number density should be comparable to that of the microwave background photons , so one expects a relic density parameter @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
    "if they were non - relativistic at freeze - out ( @xmath30 ) , the current density declines with the particle mass ( @xmath31 ) due to boltzmann suppression .",
    "this gives two mass windows in which @xmath32 can be interesting : @xmath33 ev and @xmath34 gev .",
    "since the current velocity dispersion of the particles should be @xmath35 , which decreases with mass , particles in the smaller and larger ranges are termed  hot \" and  cold \" respectively .",
    "particles can clump into bound objects of radius @xmath36 and velocity dispersion @xmath37 only for @xmath38 and this gives a lower limit of 4 ev for clusters , 20 ev for galactic halos and 300 ev for dwarf galaxies .",
    "large - scale structure observations also require that the universe be dominated by non - baryonic matter .",
    "this is because , in a purely baryonic universe , the density fluctuations required at decoupling to generate this structure would induce larger microwave background anisotropies than observed .",
    "however , this argument does not specify the nature of the non - baryonic dark matter precisely . the original  hot dark",
    "matter \" ( hdm ) scenario , proposed in the early 1980s , assumed that it was in the form of neutrinos but that would be incompatible with the presence of dark matter in dwarf galaxies .",
    "this was superseded in the mid-1980s by the ",
    "cold dark matter \" ( cdm ) scenario and this remained popular for almost a decade when it was found that it did not fit the latest large - scale structure data or give the observed gas fraction in clusters . in the mid-1990s models invoking",
    "a mixture of hot and cold dark matter ( chdm ) became topical but these still had problems explaining the observed abundances of clusters , bright galaxies and lyman-@xmath7 clouds .",
    "currently we have seen that a universe containing both a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ( @xmath39 ) is in vogue and some people have considered a hot component ( @xmath40 ) as well .    eventually the combination of large - scale structure data and microwave background anisotropy measurements could determine the relative contributions of all the different types of dark matter very precisely ( gawiser & silk 1998 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , it already seems clear that each of the components is needed and that their densities are all comparable . of course , these arguments provide only indirect evidence for non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "more definitive evidence can come only from attempts to detect the hot or cold particles directly .",
    "there have been several recent interesting developments in this context , as we now discuss .",
    "_ massive neutrinos_. there are now three experiments which indicate a non - zero neutrino mass and hence a non - zero cosmological neutrino density [ see caldwell ( 1999 ) for a recent review ] .",
    "( 1 ) studies of the ratio of muon and electron neutrinos produced by the decay of pions in the atmosphere suggest that there are oscillations between muon and tau neutrinos , corresponding to a mass difference @xmath41 .",
    "( 2 ) the deficit of electron - neutrinos coming from the sun implies that these neutrinos must be oscillating into another neutrino species ( labelled  x \" ) with a mass difference , if attributed to the msw effect , given by @xmath42 .",
    "( 3 ) lsnd claims to have detected oscillations between muon and electron neutrinos in neutrino beams coming from accelerator experiments , corresponding to a mass difference @xmath43 .",
    "this is a controversial result but , if true , it implies @xmath44 and hence @xmath45 , which is already comparable to the visible density given by eqn ( 3 ) .",
    "since the first experiment implies @xmath46 , the particle x required to explain the solar neutrino deficit can not be the tau nuetrino and so would most naturally be identified with the muon neutrino . in this case , @xmath47 this is consistent with the  see - saw \" mechanism and suggests that the total neutrino density is very low .",
    "another possibility , and the only one compatible with the lsnd result , is that @xmath48 , so that one has mass degeneracy and @xmath49 . in this case",
    "@xmath50 could be large and is limited only by the large - scale structure observations ( i.e. @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , the solar neutrino problem could not then be atributed to electron neutrinos oscillating into muon neutrinos since @xmath52 would be too large .",
    "one would therefore need to identify x with a new  sterile \" neutrino , whose mass is very close to that of the electron neutrino , so that @xmath53 .",
    "it has been claimed that the sterile neutrino may be useful for astrophysical purposes ( eg . in explaining the abundance of r - process elements ) but this remains controversial .    _",

    "[ see roszkowski ( 1999 ) and ellis ( 2000 ) and for recent reviews . ] the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) should be stable and observations require that it has neither electric nor strong interactions .",
    "three candidates have been suggested : the ( spin 0 ) sneutrino , the ( spin 3/2 ) gravitino , and the ( spin 1/2 ) neutralino .",
    "however , the lep results imply that the sneutrino mass must exceed @xmath2 tev , which gives a negligible density , while the gravitino would have a mass of order @xmath2 kev , corresponding to  warm \" dark matter",
    ". the latter would be inconsistent with large - scale structure observations , although another scenario has recently been proposed in which 100 gev gravitinos are produced in the context of leptogenesis .",
    "the neutralino is therefore the favoured wimp candidate and this would need to be some mixture of the photino , higgsino and zino .",
    "lep implies that the mass must be in the range @xmath55 gev , corresponding to @xmath56 .",
    "one would expect there to be a continual flux of halo neutralinos passing through the earth and efforts to detect these has been underway for more than a decade .",
    "recently the dama group claims to have made a positive detection , associated with the annual modulation of the flux as the earth goes around the sun .",
    "they find a mass in the range @xmath57 gev but it should be stressed that this depends sensitively on the halo model .",
    "_ axions_. the axion is a particle associated with the breaking of peccei - quinn symmetry at a temperature @xmath58gev and it aquires a mass @xmath59 due to instanton effects at a temperature @xmath60 . in the original thermal production scenario , the associated parameters are @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the  misalignment \" angle ( preskill et al . 1983 ) .",
    "several astrophysical constraints require @xmath63 and microwave cavity searches focus on the mass range @xmath64 .",
    "later it was realized that a network of axion strings could form at the peccei - quinn epoch ( davis & shellard 1989 ) and axion domain walls could form at the qcd epoch ( shellard 1990 ) .",
    "the decay and interaction of these strings and walls could produce an axion density in the range @xmath65 , which is considerably larger than indicated by eqn ( 7 ) .",
    "various refinements of these scenarios arise in the inflationary scenarios , depending on whether inflation occurs at a higher or lower temperature than @xmath66 ( shellard & battye 1998 ) .",
    "the combination of the supersymmetry and peccei - quinn symmetry also implies the existence of an axino . in the simplest scenario",
    "this has a mass of order a kev and therefore acts like warm dark matter .",
    "however , in a more recent scenario the photino decays into an axino and a photon and this predicts a much larger axino density ( covi et al .",

    "for example , kaluza - klein theory predicts many helicity states with mass near the planck mass ( ellis et al .",

    "the origin of such cosmic rays is currently unknown but they must originate within 30 - 50 mpc ( because of the gzk effect ) and they do not seem to be associated with individual galaxies or gamma - ray bursts .",
    "another possible explanation would be the decay of topological defects . in any case ,",
    "observations of uhe cosmic rays already place interesting constraints on such scenarios ( ziaeepour 1999 ) .",
    "_ indirect detections_. there are various ways in which dark matter particles might be detected indirectly . for example , the annihilations of wimps in the galactic halo would produce a flux of positron and antiproton cosmic rays ( bergstrom 1999 ) .",
    "balloon experiments have detected an excess of such particles but it is difficult to identify them specifically with wimps . they might also be secondary particles produced by the interaction of primary cosmic rays with interstellar protons and there is much uncertainty associated with the propagation of cosmic rays through the galaxy and their modulation by the solar wind .",
    "wimp - annihilations would also induce a a galactic @xmath68-ray background , with a characteristic enhancement of a @xmath68-line near the galactic centre in the cdm scenario .",
    "such a background may have already been detected with the egret satellite ( chary & wright 1998 ) .",
    "over the last few decades , a number of observational claims have been made from time to time which seemed to indicate the existence of machos .",
    "many of these observations turned out to be spurious but they served the useful purpose of stimulating theorists to study cosmological scenarios involving baryonic dark matter and to try to predict their various signatures .",
    "currently one can not state definitely that machos exist but one can place important constraints on the possible candidates . in this section",

    "there have been several reported detections of such a background but these have usually turned out to be false alarms .",
    "cobe does now seem to have detected a genuine infrared background ( fixsen et al",
    ". 1998 ) but this can probably be attributed to ordinary population i and ii stars . in any case , the current constraints on such a background strongly limit the density of any vmos unless they form at a very high redshift . for this reason massive population iii stars would need to be pregalactic rather than protogalactic .",
    "_ dynamical effects of smos_. stars larger than @xmath71 - termed  supermassive objects \" or smos - would collapse directly to black holes without any nucleosynthetic or background light production",

    "although it has been claimed that there is positive evidence for some of these effects , such as disc heating ( lacey & ostriker 1985 ) , the interpretation of this evidence is not clear - cut .",
    "it is therefore more natural to regard these dynamical effects as merely imposing an upper limit on the density of black holes or indeed any other type of compact object .",

    "although there are theoretical reasons for entertaining this possibility , earlier observational claims that low metallicity objects have a steeper imf than usual are now discredited .",
    "indeed observations of galactic and lmc globular clusters ( elson et al . 1999 ) and dwarf spheroidal field stars ( feltzing et al .",
    "1999 ) suggest that the imf is _ universal _ with @xmath95 at low masses ( gilmore 1999 ) .",
    "this implies that the bd fraction is much less than 1% by mass .",
    "however , it should be stressed that nobody has yet measured the imf in the sites which are most likely to be associated with population iii stars .",
    "we have seen that the lmc microlensing results would now seem to exclude a large fraction of bds in our own halo .",
    "although honma & kan - ya ( 1998 ) have presented 100% bd models , these would require falling rotation curves and most theorists would regard these as rather implausible .",
    "\\1 ) cosmological nucleosynthesis calculations suggest that there is both baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter . from a theoretical perspective , the latter is better motivated since one can not be sure that the dark baryons are inside galaxies . the more conservative conclusion would be that they are contained in an intergalactic medium or in gas within groups or clusters of galaxies .",
    "\\2 ) over the years there have been several observational claims which seem to indicate the existence of machos but these have usually turned out to be false alarms .",
    "currently the only _ positive _ evidence comes from microlensing observations and the lmc results suggest that white dwarfs may be the best macho candidate .",
    "however , it must be stressed that the mass estimate upon which this inference is based is sensitive to assumptions about the halo model and the large number of arguments which have been voiced against white dwarfs in the past can not be brushed aside too cavalierly .",
    "\\3 ) there are still many viable non - baryonic candidates . as with the baryonic candidates ,",
    "there have been a number of flase alarms in the past . however , the most recent experimental results require that there be at least some hot dark matter in the form of neutrinos and there are also clams to have detected cold dark matter in the form of wimps .",
    "\\4 ) we have seen that there are many important _ constraints _ on both baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter candidates from a wide variety of other astrophysical effects . until there is a definite detection , therefore ,",
    "the best strategy is to proceed by _ eliminating _ candidates , on the sherlock holmes principle that whatever candidate remains , however implausible , must be correct .",
