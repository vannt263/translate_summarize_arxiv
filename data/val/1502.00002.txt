    "a variety of electronic solids settle into equilibrium states that spontaneously break the translational symmetry of the underlying crystal @xcite .",
    "well known examples are charge density wave ( cdw ) and spin density wave ( sdw ) orders where either the electron s charge or its spin forms a frozen periodically oscillating pattern .",
    "density wave order has been found in conventional metals as well as in strongly correlated systems such as the underdoped cuprates , iron pnictides , and organic materials , and are intertwined with many other fascinating phenomena such as for instance high temperature superconductivity .",
    "it has long been recognized that density wave orders of various kinds are strongly sensitive to the presence of impurities .",
    "there is a large literature on the fascinating effects of quenched disorder on charge density wave systems . in contrast , despite the common occurrence of spin density wave ordering , surprisingly little attention has been devoted to impurity effects on sdw systems , and this is the subject of this paper .",
    "it is important to distinguish between _ collinear _ sdws where the spin orientation oscillates in space along a fixed common direction and _ spiral _ sdws where the spin rotates around an axis as a function of space while the magnitude @xmath1 is constant . both kinds of sdw order break both spin - rotation and lattice translation symmetries , but the latter retains a combination of the two as a symmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "disorder effects on collinear sdws are stronger and are the focus of our study .",
    "we show that weak non - magnetic disorder transforms the sdw state into a new glassy state of matter ",
    "distinct from the conventional spin glass  which we dub the sdw glass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sdw1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the characteristics of a conventional spin glass , i.e. the presence of locally frozen moments but absence of long - range spin order , the sdw glass spontaneously breaks spin - rotation symmetry and hosts an associated goldstone mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sdw2 ] ) .",
    "questions closely related to the ones we study arise in considering the effects of impurities on pair density wave ( pdw ) superconductors of the kind proposed to be realized in the high temperature superconductor @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "for a recent review ) .",
    "these are superconducting states where the pair amplitude is modulated in space .",
    "such states were originally conceived by larkin and ovchinnikov@xcite when considering the effects of a zeeman magnetic field on an s - wave superconductor ( closely related states were considered by fulde and ferrell@xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the phenomenology observed in @xmath0 , refs",
    ".   proposed that a pdw state is realized at zero magnetic field in this system .",
    "its microscopic origin remains to be understood . like the analogous sdw order",
    ", the pdw state is also expected to be strongly sensitive to impurities .",
    "refs .   suggested that disorder necessarily introduces half - quantum ( @xmath2 ) vortices leading to broken time reversal symmetry .",
    "we revisit this issue and find that in the phase analogous to the sdw glass , such vortices will not be induced by weak disorder and that time reversal symmetry is preserved .",
    "a fluctuating version of the pdw state also appears as a ` mother ' state that controls the physics of the pseudogap regime in the cuprates in a recently proposed theory @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we focus initially on a unidirectional collinear sdw at wave - vector @xmath3 in which the spin oscillates as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a real unit vector and @xmath6 is the amplitude .",
    "we further assume that @xmath3 is incommensurate with the crystalline lattice .",
    "such sdw order is sometimes also referred to as a ` spin stripe ' .",
    "a simple landau argument shows that this pattern of spin ordering induces cdw order at wave vector @xmath7 : @xmath8    to discuss situations in which the sdw order is fluctuating ( either due to quenched disorder or due to thermal / quantum fluctuations ) we write the spin as @xmath9 @xmath10 describes the phase of the sdw ( or the stripe displacement , in the stripe picture ) .",
    "we take both @xmath10 and @xmath5 to be space ( and possibly time ) dependent but varying on length scales long compared to the sdw wavelength .",
    "the fluctuating sdw order parameter near wave vector @xmath11 is thus @xmath12 the corresponding fluctuating cdw order parameter is @xmath13 it is useful to formulate discussions of fluctuations in terms of the two separate fields @xmath14 and @xmath5 .",
    "both the sdw order parameter @xmath15 and the cdw order parameter @xmath16 are composites made out of @xmath17 and @xmath5 . clearly the @xmath18 representation has a @xmath19 gauge redundancy under @xmath20 so that neither of them are directly physical @xcite .",
    "the sdw / cdw order parameters are of course gauge invariant .",
    "let us now turn to the closely analogous pdw state ( sometimes called a striped superconductor or the larkin - ovchinnikov phase ) .",
    "this is a superconductor in which the pair wave function @xmath21 is modulated in space : @xmath22 this too will induce cdw order at wave vector @xmath7 .",
    "when fluctuating we may write @xmath23 the fourier components of @xmath24 near @xmath11 are thus @xmath25 .",
    "there is again a @xmath19 gauge redundancy under @xmath26 .",
    "the pdw state is thus conceptually very similar to a sdw state with just @xmath27 spin symmetry .",
    "however there is an important difference in the action of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the pdw state preserves time reversal while the sdw breaks it .",
    "formally this is because the @xmath28 charge conservation symmetry ( broken in the sc ) does not commute with time reversal while spin rotations do .",
    "nevertheless we will consider both orders within the same framework . unless otherwise specified we will phrase our discussion in terms of sdw order .",
    "the structure of topological defects in these density wave states@xcite will play a crucial role below .",
    "of particular importance are dislocations in the cdw pattern .",
    "these are line defects in 3d and point defects in 2d around which @xmath10 winds .",
    "the ` elementary ' strength-@xmath29 dislocation where the cdw phase @xmath30 winds by @xmath31 requires that @xmath5 winds by @xmath32 so that the sdw order @xmath33 is single valued .",
    "in contrast strength-@xmath34 dislocations have @xmath30 wind by @xmath35 without any winding of @xmath5 .",
    "exactly the same considerations also apply in the superconducting context as described in refs .  .",
    "it is interesting to consider the physical interpretation of the various topological defects in this case .",
    "the strength-@xmath29 cdw dislocation now requires that the superconducting phase @xmath36 wind by @xmath32 .",
    "this corresponds to a superconducting vortex with magnetic flux @xmath37 , _",
    "i.e _ half the usual flux quantum .",
    "strength-@xmath34 cdw dislocations in contrast do not bind to superconducting vortices .",
    "we want to consider the fate of the sdw in the presence of weak non - magnetic impurities .",
    "such impurities lead to a random potential @xmath38 that couples linearly to the cdw order parameter , i.e. @xmath39 the first term couples to the long wavelength part of the charge density ( with @xmath40 random ) and the second to the density near the ordering wave vector . here",
    "there is however no linear coupling to the primary sdw order parameter .",
    "the impurity coupling is captured by a simple lattice model : @xmath42 here @xmath43 are random uncorrelated variables .",
    "other equivalent lattice models may be formulated and are described in the appendix [ app.model ] .    as is well known@xcite the ` random field ' disorder destroys lro in the cdw for physical dimensions @xmath44 .",
    "the elastic energy cost of adjusting to disorder over a scale @xmath45 scales as @xmath46 while the energy gain due to the disorder potential scales as @xmath47 , thus the latter dominates for @xmath48 . as a consequence , beyond a length scale ( known as the larkin length )",
    "@xmath49 long range cdw order is destroyed .",
    "this immediately implies the absence of long range sdw order as well ( as long range sdw order if present would have induced cdw order ) . at distances",
    "longer than @xmath50 the disordered sdw enters a phase of matter that we dub the sdw glass and whose physics we describe below .",
    "we begin our analysis in @xmath51 dimensions by reviewing the physics of pinned cdw systems . in pioneering work , ref .",
    "proposed that at weak disorder the pinned cdw enters an ` elastic glass ' phase where long dislocation loops do not occur .",
    "this has been substantiated by numerical calculations@xcite and by general scaling arguments@xcite .",
    "the resulting state is described by a random field xy model for the cdw order parameter where dislocations are suppressed .",
    "many approximate treatments , notably a sophisticated functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculation@xcite , show that the cdw order parameter develops _ power law _",
    "correlations : @xmath52 the exponent @xmath53 is universal . to leading order in the @xmath54 expansion , @xmath55 .",
    "thus for @xmath56 , @xmath53 is estimated to be @xmath57 .",
    "the power law decay of the spatial cdw correlations implies power - law bragg peaks in the cdw structure factor @xmath58 the elastic glass phase is therefore also known as the ` bragg glass ' phase .",
    "let us now consider the implications for the sdw order .",
    "the impurities do not couple linearly to @xmath5 but will lead to random exchange energies ( ` random bond disorder ' ) . however",
    "the absence of dislocations in @xmath10 means that there is no frustration of the collinear ordering of @xmath5 .",
    "thus at weak disorder @xmath5 will continue to have true long range order .",
    "the sdw order will has power law correlations inherited from the correlations of @xmath59 . @xmath60",
    "the exponent @xmath61 can be estimated within the frg in @xmath62 . at leading order in the @xmath54 expansion we have @xmath63 .",
    "this is @xmath64 of the cdw exponent @xmath53 , as the probability distribution for @xmath10 is gaussian to this order ( for a recent discussion see ref .  ) .",
    "this gives the estimate @xmath65 in @xmath56 .",
    "however beyond leading order the distribution will not be gaussian@xcite , and hence in general @xmath66 .",
    "note that the sdw correlations decay much slower than the cdw correlations .",
    "this is expected since the cdw order is the one directly affected by the disorder .",
    "correspondingly , the spin structure factor exhibits power law bragg peaks @xmath67 this power law bragg peak should be visible in neutron diffraction measurements on weakly disordered sdw materials .",
    "but what does it mean for @xmath5 to be ordered ?",
    "@xmath5 is not gauge invariant and hence not directly observable .",
    "however ordering of @xmath5 implies ordering of the spin quadrupole moment @xmath68 thus even though the sdw order is destroyed long range spin quadrupole order ( also known as spin nematic order ) is preserved .",
    "the system develops spontaneous spin anisotropy without long range sdw ordering .",
    "this sdw glass phase has a simple physical description .",
    "the spins are frozen in time but the phase of the sdw is randomly disordered in space .",
    "the spin nematic order means that the spins retain a common axis along which they randomly point up or down .",
    "the freezing of the spins means that there is a non - zero edwards - anderson spin glass order parameter @xmath69 the disordered sdw is thus a uni - axial spin glass in a heisenberg spin system with the axis of spin orientation determined spontaneously .",
    "it is clearly distinct from the conventional heisenberg spin glass .",
    "the spin nematic order in the sdw glass phase leads to propagating goldstone modes ( nematic director waves ) .",
    "the structure of magnetic moments characteristic for the ground state and for a soft excitation are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sdw1],[fig : sdw2 ] .",
    "this should be contrasted with the halperin - saslow@xcite spin wave modes in a heisenberg spin glass which are typically damped .",
    "the sdw glass exhibits striking differences from conventional spin glasses when placed in a weak magnetic field .",
    "specifically , we will contrast the sdw glass to a heisenberg spin glass ( hsg ) given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 are random exchange couplings .",
    "recall that in the absence of disorder , a collinear sdw aligns itself perpendicular to the applied field , with a slight canting of the moments , like an antiferromagnet . in the isotropic sdw glass ,",
    "the canting is achieved by a rotation of @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to a fast ( goldstone ) mode and therefore _ does not _ exhibit slow ( glassy ) dynamics . in the hsg",
    "such a fast mode does not exist and the time scales for adjusting to the field are necessarily long .",
    "+ for an anisotropic sdw glass @xmath5 remains pinned to a specific direction in a weak enough magnetic field , and the system can only respond via the slow dynamics of @xmath72 .",
    "the cross - over value of the magnetic field @xmath73 between fast and slow dynamics is thus given by the strength of the anisotropy .",
    "in the hsg , a similar cross - over occurs , but at a much larger scale , determined by the typical exchange coupling @xmath74 .",
    "+ the same analysis presented here for the sdw also applies for a pdw .",
    "the analog of the spin nematic order parameter is a uniform charge-4@xmath75 superconducting order @xmath76 .",
    "however we are not aware of any system that is proposed to host a pdw at zero magnetic field in @xmath51 dimensions .",
    "our results should be pertinent though to larkin - ovchinikov pairing induced by a magnetic field in three dimensional superconductors .",
    "the breaking of time reversal allows additional terms in the hamiltonian , in particular a linear coupling between the gradients of the phases of cdw and the condensate , i.e. in the continuum limit @xmath77 however , the pdw glass phase is perturbatively stable against such a term .",
    "clearly the ground state in the absence of disorder is unaffected by @xmath78 for small @xmath79 . in the presence of disorder , at long distances @xmath80",
    ", @xmath78 contributes to the random bond energy for the charge-4@xmath75 superconducting order parameter @xmath76 , which is irrelevant in the pdw glass where @xmath81 .",
    "the same conclusion can be readily obtained through an frg analysis ( see appendix [ app.fflofrg ] ) .",
    "we now turn to @xmath82 . once again the random field will destroy long range cdw and hence long range sdw order .",
    "the fate of dislocations is however more subtle . in the simpler problem of the 2d random field xy model ( appropriate to describe unidirectional cdw ordering not derived from a more primary sdw or pdw order )",
    ", topological defects always proliferate at long scales , leading to exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "these defects cost elastic energy which must be balanced against the energy gain due to the random correlated potential induced by the random field .",
    "show that at long enough scales the optimized potential energy for introducing vortices dominates so that it is always favorable to nucleate defects .    in the sdw system , single and doubled",
    "cdw dislocations have different elastic cost  the energy of the former depends on the stiffness associated with spin distortions while the energy of the latter does not .",
    "hence they could potentially behave very differently . while one expects that doubled dislocations",
    "are always generated at long length scales the fate of isolated single dislocations is less clear .",
    "let us first describe a putative state where doubled dislocations have proliferated but single ones have not . in such a state the cdw correlations , and hence the sdw correlations decay exponentially .",
    "despite that there is long range spin nematic order . thus this is a 2d sdw glass phase with coexisting spin nematic order .",
    "it is particularly interesting to note the meaning of these issues in the pdw context .",
    "the analog of the spin nematic then is a uniform charge-4@xmath75 superconductor .",
    "further ( see section [ optd ] ) a strength-@xmath29 cdw dislocation is bound to a @xmath32 winding of the sc phase .",
    "this corresponds to a half - quantum vortex with @xmath37 flux . clearly",
    "two different dislocations of this kind are possible depending on whether the flux is positive or negative .",
    "any such single dislocation necessarily breaks time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus if disorder nucleates these single dislocations then the pdw glass will break time reversal spontaneously by generating randomly placed @xmath83 half - quantum vortices of either sign .",
    "such vortices can be imaged using local probes of magnetism such as a scanning squid microscope , and can serve as a key experimental test of the proposed pdw state in @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore now pose the question of whether such single dislocations are _ necessarily _ generated at _ weak _ disorder in either the sdw or pdw system",
    ".    for simplicity and to provide a unified discussion of both sdw and pdw systems , we will specialize to xy spins .",
    "the fate of dislocations may be discussed within an appropriate elastic model which takes the form @xmath84 here @xmath85 are the stiffnesses of the cdw and sdw ( or pdw ) order parameters respectively .",
    "the phase of the sdw ( or pdw ) order parameter is @xmath86 , and that of the cdw order parameter is @xmath30 .",
    "the disorder is taken to be delta - correlated @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "( [ eq.h2d ] ) is the basis for our analysis of dislocations in the rest of this section .",
    "the @xmath10 sector is again described by an @xmath27 model with random anisotropy . however , in this case there is no stable dislocation free phase even for weak disorder .",
    "we will begin with discussions by reviewing some basic facts on this model : in the case of random forces ( i.e the @xmath89 term ) , but without random fields , the relative displacement @xmath90 grows logarithmically with distance , with a coefficient given by the variance @xmath91 of the random force @xcite .",
    "the energy cost of the cheapest dislocation is@xcite @xmath92 , i.e. there is a critical strength @xmath93 of the random force , below which no isolated dislocations are present in the ground state . in the presence of random fields but with dislocations excluded , @xmath91 is renormalized without bound@xcite as @xmath94 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath95 is temperature dependent .",
    "this implies @xmath96 thus @xmath97 decays faster than any power law , and the associated bragg peaks are indistinguishable from the case of short - range correlations .",
    "when dislocations are allowed , they always become relevant@xcite for large enough @xmath45 since @xmath98 . beyond the scale where dislocations proliferate",
    ", @xmath99 decays exponentially .",
    "and the ratio @xmath100 of the stiffnesses associated with spin waves / phonons in the absence of disorder ]        the analysis in appendix [ app.scales ] shows that single dislocations proliferate at a scale @xmath101 doubled dislocations on the other hand proliferate at a different length scale @xmath102 it follows that for large @xmath103 strength-@xmath34 dislocations proliferate at a shorter length scale . in that case",
    "the physics for distances longer than @xmath104 is modified from that described by the elastic model .",
    "the prevalence of doubled dislocations renormalizes @xmath105 to zero without affecting @xmath106 .",
    "the net energy cost of the spin distortion associated with a strength-@xmath29 dislocation is then @xmath107 but now the optimal potential energy gain of the dislocation will just be a constant ( see appendix [ app.gauge ] ) .",
    "thus in this case strength-@xmath29 dislocations are suppressed even at the longest length scales . in the sdw glass",
    "this implies that spin nematic long range order survives at weak disorder in this regime . in the pdw glass in this regime time reversal",
    "is preserved and the disorder does not introduce half - quantum vortices . rather there is true long range order in the charge-@xmath108 superconducting order parameter .    in the opposite regime of large @xmath109 single dislocations will proliferate first even at weak disorder . in either regime at strong disorder",
    "single dislocations will proliferate . the schematic phase diagram is shown in fig .",

    "there have been several studies of the suppression of sdw order in @xmath139 when it is alloyed with other transition metal elements ( see refs .   and references therein ) , for instance vanadium @xmath140 .",
    "at low @xmath140 concentrations where the disorder is weak , we expect our results to apply directly and predict the occurrence of the 3d sdw glass phase .",
    "consequently the static spin structure factor is a power law ( eqn .",
    "[ 3dsdwgsfc ] ) , potentially visible in high resolution neutron diffraction studies .",
    "the sdw glass offers an interesting experimental opportunity to probe the physics of the 3d bragg glass in magnetic systems .",
    "the original theoretical proposal@xcite of the bragg glass phase spurred a search for it in a few experimental systems , notably in vortex matter inside superconductors ( for a review see ref .  ) .",
    "ref .   provided evidence for the predicted power law bragg peaks in a disordered vortex lattice through small angle neutron scattering .",
    "experimental evidence for bragg glass physics in cdw systems seems scarce  probably due to the strong coupling to disorder of the cdw order parameter .",
    "recently however scanning tunneling microscopy images of the quasi - two dimensional cdw ordered system @xmath141 have been interpreted@xcite in terms of a bragg glass picture which might describe intermediate length scale physics .",
    "sdw systems of the kind considered in this paper offer a different context for bragg glass physics which may be more directly amenable to experimental studies .",
    "we emphasize that the sdw glass is distinct from the conventional heisenberg spin glass .",
    "the sdw glass is also distinct from the ` cluster spin glass ' which macroscopically is the same phase as the usual spin glass .",
    "it is interesting that even some ` classic ' metallic spin glasses@xcite ( for instance @xmath142 ) actually have substantial short range sdw order@xcite ( visible in neutron diffraction as a well defined finite wave vector peak ) .",
    "physically these are usefully understood as obtained from local pinning of sdw fluctuations of elemental @xmath143 around @xmath144 impurities .",
    "a useful theoretical approach to understanding these systems may be to start with the sdw glass described in this paper and then to disrupt it with topological defects at long length scales .    turning to @xmath145 systems , it is interesting to consider the very lightly doped cuprates within the framework of our results . at low-@xmath146 ,",
    "these have long been reported to have spin glass order but also show substantial coexisting sdw correlations@xcite . as we have argued if the ` parent ' sdw order is uniaxial ( _ i.e _ not a spiral ) then two distinct kinds of glassy states are possible in both of which the sdw correlations decay exponentially on long scales .",
    "when only doubled dislocations of the accompanying cdw are induced ( the 2d sdw glass phase ) , spin nematic order persists .",
    "if however single dislocations are also induced the resulting phase is smoothly connected to the conventional spin glass .",
    "what experiments can help distinguish between these two phases ? as we discussed they will have rather similar peaks in neutron diffraction .",
    "more telling will be local probes of the spin dynamics for instance through nmr .",
    "the local dynamic spin susceptibility in the sdw glass phase should behave similarly to that in an ordered antiferromagnet ( as the @xmath10 field is frozen the spin auto - correlation is determined entirely by @xmath5 ) , and will not show very striking glassy effects .",
    "in contrast there will be a wide range of relaxation times in a conventional spin glass .",
    "for pdw order the main proposed candidate to date are the cuprates , notably @xmath0 .",
    "close to @xmath147 , there is an interesting window of temperatures between @xmath148 and @xmath149 where the in - plane resistivity is immeasurably small while there is a non - zero @xmath150-axis resistivity@xcite .",
    "further the meissner effect itself onsets only below @xmath148 .",
    "it has been suggested that this behavior may be explained by a pdw order pinned by impurities , and with frustrated @xmath150-axis josephson coupling .",
    "our results show that there are two possible fates of the pdw at weak disorder . in the pdw glass phase",
    "there are no frozen disorder - induced superconducting vortices .",
    "consequently we expect a meissner effect in this phase , and a non - zero critical current . in the fully disordered glass phase",
    "there are frozen random sign @xmath37 vortices .",
    "this phase is then likely to behave similarly to a vortex glass .",
    "it will presumably have vanishing linear resistivity but a zero critical current and no meissner effect .",

    "an immediate consequence is the local breaking of time reversal symmetry at zero field due to the frozen @xmath83 vortices",
    ". it will be most interesting to look for this through scanning squid microscopy or other local probes of magnetism .",
    "modulated superconductivity in the fflo states , has of course , been discussed theoretically for decades . in recent years",
    "there have been suggestions of experimental sightings of this state in two different systems  first in the heavy fermion superconductor@xcite @xmath151 and very recently in an organic superconductor@xcite .",
    "both of these are very clean systems and hence our results on the effects of weak disorder may be directly applicable .",
    "@xmath151 is a 3d superconductor and therefore may be in a superconducting bragg glass phase .",
    "the organic is quasi - two dimensional and thus will at best be in a phase with long range charge-@xmath108 superconducting order . in both materials",
    "it will be interesting to look for @xmath37 flux quantization .",
    "we thank l. balents , e. fradkin , t. giamarchi , d. huse , and k. moler for useful discussions and encouragement .",
    "dfm acknowledges support by the caltech institute for quantum information and matter , an nsf physics frontiers center with support of the gordon and betty moore foundation through grant gbmf1250 ; and the walter burke institute for theoretical physics at caltech .",
    "ts was supported by department of energy desc-8739- er46872 , and partially by a simons investigator award from the simons foundation .",
    "the starting point for the frg analysis is the long - wavelength hamiltonian @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a symmetric , periodic function and @xmath154 is the inverse temperature . in the sdw glass @xmath155 and @xmath123",
    "the renormalization group equations for @xmath156 were derived in ref .   as @xmath157 where @xmath158 and the tree level scaling of the elastic term has been absorbed into @xmath154 .",
    "in the present case of @xmath159 , it is clear that @xmath106 and @xmath79 can not be renormalized by @xmath140 .",
    "the only modification to the rg equations is @xmath160 which can be absorbed by a simple rescaling so long as @xmath161 .",
    "thus the 3d fflo glass exhibits the same universal properties as the 3d sdw glass discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec.3d ] .",
    "in the main text we introduced the hamiltonian @xmath162 to capture the low - energy properties of the order parameters , in particular the structure of topological defects and the coupling to the disorder potential . a key feature of this hamiltonian is a large redundacy corresponding to local gauge invariance under @xmath163 , @xmath164 . in some cases it is more convenient to adopt an alternative , equivalent formulation which makes this",
    "more explicit , and at the same time highlights the special role played by single dislocations . to this end",
    "we introduce a model in terms of @xmath165 and @xmath166 coupled to a @xmath167 gauge field @xmath168 with the hamiltonian @xmath169 this has the same gauge invariance as @xmath170 provided that @xmath163 , @xmath164 is accompanied by @xmath171 for all sites @xmath172 connected to @xmath173 ( the familiar ` star ' transformation in @xmath19 gauge theory ) . in the ground state",
    "one may choose the gauge @xmath174 to see that @xmath170 and @xmath175 yield the same energy for smooth fluctuations of @xmath5 and @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , @xmath175 clearly allows @xmath31 vortices in @xmath5 and double dislocations .",
    "in addition , there may be ` visons ' i.e. @xmath32 flux configurations in the @xmath168 which can not be removed by a gauge transformation .",
    "this flux is seen by _ both _ @xmath5 and @xmath72 , and therefore induces a single dislocation tied to a half - vortex in @xmath5 .",
    "thus the structure of topological defects in @xmath170 and @xmath175 is identical . since the divergent contribution to the energy of any allowed defect",
    "is determined by the elastic terms in the hamiltonian , @xmath170 and @xmath175 describe the same physics at long length scales .",
    "the presence or absence of isolated dislocations is determined by the balance between elastic energy cost and energy gain due to disorder . the elastic energy cost of a defect where @xmath10 winds by @xmath176 and @xmath36 winds by @xmath177 @xmath178 the energy gain @xmath179 due to disorder depends on the position @xmath180 of the vortex and the particular disorder realization .",
    "the distribution of @xmath181 for a constant variance of the random force is given by @xcite @xmath182 in the presence of random - fields , the variance of the random force is itself scale - dependent @xmath183 where @xmath95 is temperature dependent and @xmath184 is the larkin length . in this case , a reasonable approximation consists of replacing the variance @xmath91 of the random force by its average on a logarithmic scale @xmath185 the probability @xmath186 that it a vortex exists in a volume @xmath187 is given by @xmath188 to estimate the scale where defects proliferate , we drop the subleading factor and set @xmath189 , obtaining @xmath190",
    "in this appendix we sharpen the arguments justifying the absence of single dislocations at long wavelengths for large @xmath103 in 2d .",
    "this is most conveniently done within the alternative formulation of the model introduced in app .",
    "[ app.model ] .",
    "although @xmath175 can be fruitfully used to discuss all length scales / parameter regimes , we will use it here as an effective model for the large @xmath103 regime at length scales longer than @xmath104 ( the scale of doubled dislocation proliferation ) discussed in the main text .",
    "thus we will take the lattice spacing to be of order @xmath104 . the long length scale physics",
    "is then captured by this model with @xmath191 .",
    "note that the core energy of a single dislocation must be taken to be @xmath192 .",
    "when @xmath191 we have @xmath193 with @xmath194 . then the hamiltonian becomes @xmath195 we define @xmath196 . with @xmath197 random uncorrelated variables",
    ", @xmath198 will have a probability distribution symmetrically distributed zero , and will be uncorrelated between different sites . in the absence of the @xmath168",
    "the second term describes a 2d ising spin glass . in the configuration of @xmath199 there will with some probability be several frustrated plaquettes ( where the product around the plaquette of @xmath198 will be negative ) . if the gauge field @xmath168 adjusts itself to  unfrustrate \" those frustrated plaquettes the ising subsystem will gain energy @xmath200 for some constant @xmath79 .",
    "however such a @xmath32-flux of @xmath168 nucleates a @xmath32 disinclination in @xmath5 which costs energy @xmath192 in addition to the elastic energy of distorting the @xmath5 upto the typical separation between two such frustrated plaquettes .",
    "thus the cost of nucleating a @xmath32-disclination in @xmath5 overwhelms any energy gain from unfrustrating the ising spin @xmath201 .",
    "single dislocations are therefore suppressed in this regime .      for a recent review",
