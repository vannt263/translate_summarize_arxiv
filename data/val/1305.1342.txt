    "understanding the nature of quantum correlations in multiparty systems and the distinguishing features they exhibit relative to classical correlations is a central goal across quantum information processing ( qip ) science @xcite , with implications ranging from condensed - matter and statistical physics to quantum chemistry , and the quantum - to - classical transition . from a foundational perspective , exploring what different kinds of correlations are , in principle , allowed by probabilistic theories more general than quantum mechanics further helps to identify under which set of physical constraints the standard quantum framework may be uniquely recovered @xcite .    in this context , entanglement provides a distinctively quantum type of correlation , that has no analogue in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "a striking feature of entanglement is that it can not be freely distributed among different parties : if a bipartite system , say , @xmath4(lice ) and @xmath5(ob ) , is in a maximally entangled pure state , then no other system , @xmath6(harlie ) , may be correlated with it . in other words ,",
    "the entanglement between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is _ monogamous _ and can not be _ shared _",
    "this simple tripartite setting motivates two simple questions about bipartite quantum states : given a bipartite state , we ask whether it can arise as the reduced state of @xmath4-@xmath5 and of @xmath4-@xmath6 simultaneously ; or , more generally , given two bipartite states , we ask if one can arise as the reduced state of @xmath4-@xmath5 while the other arises as the reduced state of @xmath4-@xmath6 .",
    "it should be emphasized that both of these are questions about the existence of tripartite states with given reduction properties .",
    "while formal ( and more general ) definitions will be provided later in the paper , these examples serve to introduce the notions of _ sharing _ ( 1 - 2 sharing ) and _ joining _ ( 1 - 2 joining ) , respectively . in its most general formulation , the joinability problem is also known as the _ quantum marginal problem _ ( or _ local consistency problem _ ) , which has been heavily investigated both from a mathematical - physics @xcite and a quantum - chemistry perspective @xcite and is known to be qma - hard @xcite .",
    "our choice of terminology , however , facilitates a uniform language for describing the joinability / sharability scenarios .",
    "for instance , we say that the joinable correlations of @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath6 are joined by a joining state on @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6 .",
    "the limited sharability / joinability of entanglement was first quantified in the seminal work by coffman , kundu , and wootters , in terms of an exact ( ckw ) inequality obeyed by the entanglement across the @xmath4-@xmath5 , @xmath4-@xmath6 and @xmath4-@xmath7 bipartitions , as measured by concurrence @xcite . in a similar venue",
    ", several subsequent investigations attempted to determine how different entanglement measures can be used to diagnose failures of joinability , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "more recently , significant progress has been made in characterizing quantum correlations more general than entanglement @xcite , in particular as captured by quantum discord @xcite .",
    "while it is now established that quantum discord does not obey a monogamy inequality @xcite , different kind of limitations exist on the extent to which it can be freely shared and/or communicated @xcite . despite these important advances ,",
    "a complete picture is far from being reached .",
    "what kind of limitations do strictly mark the quantum - classical correlation boundary ?",
    "what different quantum features are responsible for enforcing different aspects of such limitations , and how does this relate to the degree of resourcefulness that these correlations can have for qip ?    while the above are some of the broad questions motivating this work , our specific focus here is to make progress on joinability and sharability properties in low - dimensional multipartite settings . in this context , a recent paper @xcite has obtained a necessary condition for three - party joining in finite dimension in terms of the subsystem entropies , and additionally established a sufficient condition in terms of the trace - norm distances between the states in question and known joinable states . for the specific case of qubit",
    "werner states @xcite , werner himself established necessary and sufficient conditions for the 1 - 2 joining scenario @xcite . with regards to sharability ,",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions have been found for 1 - 2 sharing of generic bipartite qubit states @xcite , as well as for specific classes of qudit states @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for the joinability of generic states are available as yet . in this paper",
    ", we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for both the _ three - party joinability and the 1-@xmath3 sharability _ problems , in the case that the reduced bipartite states are _ either werner or isotropic states on @xmath1-dimensional subsystems _ ( qudits ) .",
    "though our results are restricted in scope of applicability , they provide key insights as to the sources of joinability limitations .",
    "most importantly , we find that standard measures of quantum correlations , such as concurrence and quantum discord , do not suffice to determine the limitations in joining quantum correlations . specifically , we find that the joined states need _ not _ be entangled or even discordant in order not to be joinable .",
    "further to that , although separable states may have joinability limitations , they _ are _ , nonetheless , freely ( arbitrarily ) sharable . by introducing a one - parameter class of probability distributions ,",
    "we provide a natural classical analogue to qudit werner and isotropic quantum states .",
    "this allows us to illustrate how classical joinability restrictions carry over to the quantum case and , more interestingly , to demonstrate that the quantum case demands limitations which are not present classically .",
    "ultimately , this feature may be traced back to _",
    "complementarity of observables _ , which clearly plays no role in the classical case .",
    "it is suggestive to note that the uncertainty principle was also shown to be instrumental in constraining the sharability of quantum discord @xcite .",
    "it is our hope that further pursuits of more general necessary and sufficient conditions may be aided by the methods and findings herein .",
    "the content is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ subsec : wsharability ] we establish simple analytic expressions for the 1-@xmath3 sharability of both werner and isotropic states , along with discussing constructive procedures to determine @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability properties for @xmath8 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : furtherremarks ] , we present additional remarks on joinability and sharability scenarios beyond those of sec .",
    "[ sec : wernerstates ] .",
    "in particular , we outline generalizations of our analysis to @xmath0-party joinability , and show how bounds on the sharability of _ arbitrary bipartite states _ follow from the werner and isotropic results .",
    "concluding remarks and open questions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : end ] . for ease and clarity of presentation , the technical proofs of the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : wernerstates ] are presented in two separate appendixes ( [ sec : joiningreptools ] on joinability and [ sec : sharingreptools ] on sharability , respectively ) , together with the relevant group - representation tools .",
    "although our main focus will be to quantitatively characterize simple low - dimensional settings , we introduce the relevant concepts with a higher degree of generality , in order to better highlight the underlying mathematical structure and to ease connections with existing related notions in the literature .",
    "we are interested in the correlations among the subsystems of a @xmath0-partite composite system @xmath9 . in the quantum case ,",
    "we thus require a hilbert space with a tensor product structure : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the individual `` single - particle '' state spaces and , for our purposes , each @xmath12 is finite . in the classical scenario , to each subsystem we associate a sample space @xmath13 consisting of @xmath12 possible outcomes , with the joint sample space being given by the cartesian product : @xmath14 probability distributions on @xmath15 are the classical counterpart of quantum density operators on @xmath16 .",
    "the input to a joinability problem is a set of subsystem states which , in full generality , may be specified relative to a `` neighboorhood structure '' on @xmath16 ( or @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "that is , let neighborhoods @xmath17 be given as subsets of the set of indexes labeling individual subsystems , @xmath18",
    ". we can then give the following :    * [ quantum joinability ] * given a neighborhood structure @xmath19 on @xmath16 , a list of density operators @xmath20 is _ joinable _ if there exists an @xmath0-partite density operator @xmath21 , called a _ joining state _",
    ", that reduces according to the neighborhood structure , that is , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the tensor complement of @xmath24 .",
    "the analagous definition for classical joinability is obtained by substituting corresponding terms , in particular , by replacing the partial trace over @xmath25 with the corresponding marginal probability distribution .",
    "as remarked , the question of joinability has been extensively investigated in the context of the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite marginal problem .",
    "a joining state is equivalenty referred to as an _ extension _ or an element of the _ pre - image _ of the list under the reduction map , while the members of a list of joinable states are also said to be _ compatible _ or _",
    "consistent_.    clearly , a _",
    "condition for a list of states to be joinable is that they `` agree '' on any overlapping reduced states .",
    "that is , given any two states from the list whose neighborhoods are intersecting , the reduced states of the subsystems in the intersection must coincide . from this point of view , any failure of joinability due to a disagreement of overlappping reduced states is a trivial case of non - compatible @xmath0-party correlations .",
    "we are interested in cases where joinability fails _ despite _ the agreement on overlapping marginals .",
    "this consistency requirement will be satisfied by construction for the werner and isotropic quantum states we shall consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : wernerstates ] .",
    "one important feature of joinability , which has recently been investigated in @xcite , is the _ convex structure _ that both joinable states lists and joining states enjoy .",
    "the set of lists of density operators satisfying a given joinability scenario is convex under component - wise combination ; this is because the same convex combination of their joining states is a valid joining state for the convex combined list of states .",
    "similarly , the set of joining states for a given list of joined states is convex by the linearity of the partial trace .",
    "as mentioned , one of our goals is to shed light on limitations of quantum vs. classical joinability and the extent to which entanglement may play a role in that respect .",
    "that quantum states are subject to stricter joinability limitations than classical probability distributions do , can be immediately appreciated by considering two density operators @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is any maximally entangled bell pair on two qubits : no three - qubit joining state @xmath28 exists , despite the reduced state on @xmath4 being manifestly consistent .",
    "in contrast , as shown in @xcite , as long as two classical distributions have equal marginal distributions over @xmath4 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can always be joined .",
    "this is evidenced by the construction of the joining state : @xmath31 . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "although the above choice is not unique , it is the joining state with maximal entropy and represents an even mixture of all valid joining distributions .",
    "although any _ two _ consistently - overlapped classical probability distributions may be joined , limitations on joining classical probability distributions _ do _ typically arise in more general joining scenarios .",
    "this follows from the fact that any classical probability assignments must be consistent with some convex combination of pure states .",
    "consider , for example , a pairwise neighboorhood structure , with an associated list of states @xmath29 , @xmath32 , and @xmath30 , which have consistent single - subsystem marginals .",
    "clearly , if each subsystem corresponds to a bit , no convex combination of pure states gives rise to a probability distribution @xmath33 in which each pair is completely anticorrelated ; in other words , `` bits of three ca nt all disagree '' . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : wjoin ] , we explicitly compare this particular classical joining scenario to analogous quantum scenarios .",
    "while all the classical joining limitations may be expressed by linear inequalities , the quantum joining limitations are significantly more complicated .",
    "the limitations arise from demanding that the joining operator be a valid density operator , namely , trace - one and _ non - negative _ ( which clearly implies hermiticity ) .",
    "this fact is demonstrated by the following proposition , which may be readily generalized to any joining scenario :    for any two trace - one hermitian operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 which obey the consistency condition @xmath36 , there exists a trace - one hermitian joining operator @xmath37 .",
    "consider an orthogonal hermitian product basis which includes the identity for each subsystem , that is , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "then we can construct the space of all valid joining operators @xmath37 as follows .",
    "let @xmath40 be the dimension of the composite system .",
    "the component along @xmath41 is fixed as @xmath42 , satisfying the trace - one requirement .",
    "the components along the two - body operators of the form @xmath43 are fixed by the required reduction to @xmath34 , and similarly the components along the two - body operators of the form @xmath44 are determined by @xmath35 .",
    "the components along the one - body operators of the form @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are determined from the reductions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this leaves the coefficients of all remaining basis operators unconstrained , since their corresponding basis operators are zero after a partial trace over systems @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "thus , requiring the joining operator to be hermitian and normalized is not a limiting constraint with respect to joinability : _ any limitations are due to the non - negativity constraint_. understanding how non - negativity manifests is extremely difficult in general and far beyond our scope here .",
    "we can nevertheless give an example in which the role of non - negativity is clear .",
    "part of the job of non - negativity is to enforce constraints that are also obeyed by classical probability distributions .",
    "for example , in the case of a two - qubit state @xmath48 , if @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then @xmath51 _ must _ equal @xmath52 .",
    "more generally , consider a set of mutually commuting observables @xmath53 and any basis @xmath54 in which all @xmath55 are diagonal .",
    "any valid state must lead to a list of expectation values @xmath56 , whose values are element - wise convex combinations of the vertexes @xmath57 .",
    "the interpretation of this constraint is that since commuting observables have simultaneously definable values , just as classical observables do , probability distributions on them must obey the rules of classical probability distributions .",
    "we call on this fact when we compare the quantum joining limitations to the classical analogue ones in sec .",
    "[ subsec : wjoin ] .",
    "non - negativity constraints that do _ not _ arise from classical limitations on compatible observables may be labeled as inherently quantum constraints , the most familiar being provided by uncertainty relations for conjugate observables @xcite .",
    "although complementarity constraints are most evident for observables acting on the same system , complementarity can also give rise to a trade - off in the information about a subsystem observable vs. a joint observable .",
    "this fact is essentially what allows bell s inequality to be violated . for our purposes , the complementarity that comes into play",
    "is that between `` overlapping '' joint observables ( e.g. , between @xmath58 and @xmath59 for three qubits ) .",
    "we are thus generally interested in understanding the interplay between purely classical and quantum joining limitations , and in the correlation trade - offs that may possibly emerge .",
    "historically , as already mentioned , a pioneering exploration of the extent to which quantum correlations can be shared among three parties was carried out in @xcite , yielding a characterization of the monogamy of entanglement in terms of the well - known ckw inequality : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the concurrence and the right hand - side is minimized over all pure - state decompositions .",
    "thus , with the entanglement across the bipartition @xmath4 and @xmath7 held fixed , an increase in the upper bound of the @xmath4-@xmath5 entanglement can only come at the cost of a decrease in the upper bound of the @xmath4-@xmath6 entanglement .",
    "one may wonder whether the ckw inequality may help in diagnosing joinability of reduced states .",
    "if a joining state @xmath28 is _ not _ a priori determined ( in fact , the existence of such a state _ is _ the entire question of joinability ) , the ckw inequality may be used to obtain a _ necessary _ condition for joinability , namely , if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are joinable , then @xmath64 however , there exist pairs of bipartite states  both unentangled ( as the following proposition shows ) and non - trivially entangled ( as we shall determine in sec .",
    "iii.b , see in particular fig . [",
    "fig : wernerpairjoinability ] )  that obey the `` weak '' ckw inequality in eq .",
    "( [ ckwweak ] ) , yet are _ not _ joinable .",
    "the key point is that while the limitations that the ckw captures are to be ascribed to entanglement , entanglement is not required to prevent two states from being joinable .",
    "in fact , weaker forms of quantum correlations , as quantified by quantum discord @xcite , are likewise _ not _ required for joinability limitations .",
    "consider , specifically , so - called `` classical - quantum '' bipartite states , of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is some local orthogonal basis on @xmath4 and @xmath67 is , for each @xmath68 , an arbitrary state on @xmath5 .",
    "such states are known to have zero discord @xcite . yet",
    ", the following holds :    classical - quantum correlated states need not be joinable .",
    "consider the two quantum states @xmath69 on the pairs @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath6 , respectively . both have a",
    "completely mixed reduced state over @xmath4 and thus it is meaningful to consider their joinability .",
    "let @xmath28 be a joining state .",
    "then the outcome of bob s @xmath70 measurement would correctly lead him to predict alice to be in the state @xmath71 or @xmath72 , while at the same time the outcome of charlie s @xmath73 measurement would correctly lead him to predict alice to be in the state @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "since this violates the uncertainty principle , @xmath28 can not be a valid joining state .",
    "the existence of separable not joinable states has been independently reported in @xcite . while formally our example is subsumed under the more general one presented in thm .",
    "4.2 therein ( strictly satisfying the necessary condition for joinability given by their eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) ) , it has the advantage of offering both a transparent physical interpretation of the underlying correlation properties , and an intuitive proof of the joinability failure .",
    "as mentioned , the second joinability structure we analyze is motivated by the concept of sharability . in our context",
    ", we can think of sharability as a restricted joining scenario in which a bipartite state is joined with copies of itself .",
    "if @xmath76 , consider a @xmath0-partite space that consists of @xmath2 `` right '' copies of @xmath77 and @xmath3 `` left '' copies of @xmath78 , with each neighborhood consisting of one right and one left subsystem , respectively ( hence a total of @xmath79 neighborhoods ) .",
    "we then have the following :    * [ quantum sharability ] * a bipartite density operator @xmath80 is @xmath2-@xmath3 _ sharable _ if there exists an @xmath0-partite density operator @xmath81 , called a _ sharing state _ , that reduces left - right - pairwise to @xmath48 , that is , @xmath82 where the partial trace is taken over the tensor complement of neighborhood @xmath83 .",
    "each @xmath2-@xmath3 sharability scenario may be viewed as a specific joining structure with the additional constraint that each of the joining states be equal to one another , the list being @xmath84 . in",
    "what follows , we shall take _ arbitrarily sharable _ to mean @xmath85-@xmath85 sharable , whereas _",
    "finitely sharable _ means that @xmath48 is not @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable for some @xmath2 , @xmath3 . also , each property `` @xmath2-@xmath3",
    "sharable '' ( sometimes also referred to as a `` @xmath2-@xmath3 extendible '' ) is taken to define a _",
    "sharability criterion _",
    ", which a state may or may not satisfy .",
    "it is worth noting the relationship between sharability and _ n - representability_. the @xmath0-representability problem asks if , for a given ( symmetric ) @xmath86-partite density operator @xmath48 on @xmath87 , there exists an @xmath0-partite pre - image state for which @xmath48 is the @xmath86-particle reduced state .",
    "@xmath0-representability has been extensively studied for indistinguishable bosonic and fermionic subsystems @xcite and is a very important problem in quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "we can view @xmath0-representability as a variant on the sharability problem , whereby the distinction between the left and right subsystems is lifted , and @xmath88 .",
    "given the @xmath86-partite state @xmath48 as the shared state , we ask if there exists a sharing @xmath0-partite state which shares @xmath48 among all possible @xmath86-partite subsystems . in the setting of indistinguishable particles ,",
    "the associated symmetry further constrains the space of the valid @xmath0-partite sharing states .    just as with 1 - 2 joinability ,",
    "any classical probability distribution is arbitrarily sharable @xcite . likewise ,",
    "similar to the joinability case , convexity properties play an important role towards characterizing sharability .",
    "if @xmath89 and @xmath90 , then it follows from the convexity of the set of joinable states lists that @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable states form a convex set , for fixed subsystem dimensions @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath48 satisfies a particular sharability criterion , then any mixture of @xmath48 with the completely mixed state also satisfies that criterion , since the completely mixed state is arbitrarily ( @xmath85-@xmath85 ) sharable .",
    "besides mixing with the identity , the degree of sharability may be unchanged under more general transformations on the input state .",
    "consider , specifically , completely - positive trace - preserving bipartite maps @xmath93 that can be written as a mixture of local unitary operations , that is , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are arbitrary unitary transformations @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . these ( unital ) maps",
    "form a proper subset of general local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "we establish the following :    if @xmath48 is @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable , then @xmath93 is @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable for any map @xmath99 that is a convex mixture of unitaries .",
    "[ thm : locc ]    let @xmath93 be expressed as in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) . by virtue of the convexity of the set of @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable states ( for fixed subsystem dimensions )",
    ", it suffices to show that each term , @xmath100 , in @xmath93 is @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable .",
    "let @xmath101 be a sharing state for @xmath48 , and define @xmath102 then , for any left - right pair of subsystems @xmath68 and @xmath103 , it follows that @xmath104 hence , @xmath105 is an @xmath2-@xmath3-sharing state for @xmath106 , as desired .",
    "this result suggests a connection between the degree of sharability and the entanglement of a given state . in both cases ,",
    "there exist classes of states for which these properties can not be `` further degraded '' by locally acting maps ( or any map for that matter ) . obviously , locc can not decrease the entanglement of states with no entanglement , and convex unitary mixtures as above can not increase the sharability of states with @xmath85-@xmath85 sharability ( because they are already as sharable as possible ) .",
    "these two classes of states can in fact be shown to coincide as a consequence of the fact that _ arbitrary sharability is equivalent to ( bipartite ) separability_. this result has been appreciated in the literature @xcite and is credited to both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we reproduce it here in view of its relevance to our work :    a bipartite quantum state @xmath48 on @xmath107 is unentangled ( or separable ) if and only if it is arbitrarily sharable .",
    "( @xmath108 ) let @xmath48 be separable .",
    "then for some set of density operators @xmath109 , it can be written as @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath2 be arbitrary , and let the @xmath0-partite state @xmath101 , be defined as follows : @xmath112 with @xmath113 . by construction , the state of each @xmath114-@xmath115 pair is @xmath48 , since it follows straighforwardly that eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) is obeyed for each @xmath116 .",
    "thus , @xmath101 is a valid sharing state .",
    "( @xmath117 ) since @xmath48 is arbitrarily sharable , there exists a sharing state @xmath101 for arbitrary values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we need only make use of a sharing state @xmath101 for @xmath118 and arbitrarily large @xmath3 , whence we let @xmath119 . given @xmath101 , let us construct another sharing state @xmath120 , which is invariant under permutations of the right subsystems , that is , let @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the permutation group of @xmath3 objects , acting on @xmath123 via the natural @xmath3-fold representation , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath120 shares @xmath48 : @xmath126 having established the existence of a symmetric sharing state @xmath127 , fannes theorem ( see section 2 of @xcite ) implies the existence of a unique representation of @xmath120 as a sum of product states , @xmath128 reducing @xmath120 to any @xmath114-@xmath115 pair leaves a separable state .",
    "thus , if @xmath48 is 1-@xmath3 sharable it must be separable .",
    "as we alluded to before , a corollary of this result is that in fact _",
    "1-@xmath85 sharability implies _",
    "@xmath85-@xmath85 sharability . in closing this section",
    ", we also briefly mention the concept of _ exchangeability _ @xcite . a density operator @xmath48 on @xmath129 is said to be exchangeable if it is symmetric under permutation of its @xmath86 subsystems and if there exists a symmetric state @xmath101 on @xmath130 such that the reduced states of any subset of @xmath86 subsystems is @xmath48 for all @xmath131 . similar to sharability , exchangeability implies separability .",
    "however , _ the converse only holds in general for sharability _ : clearly , there exist states which are separable but not exchangeable , because of the extra symmetry requirement .",
    "thus , the notion of sharability is more directly related to entanglement than exchangeability is .",
    "even for the simplest case of two bipartite states with an overlapping marginal , a general characterization of joinability is extremely non - trivial .",
    "as remarked , no conditions yet exist which are both necessary and sufficient for two _ arbitrary _ density operators to be joinable ; although , conditions that are separately necessary or sufficient have been recently derived @xcite . in this section , we present a complete characterization of the three - party joining scenario and the 1-@xmath3 sharability problem for werner and isotropic states on arbitrary subsystem dimension @xmath1 .",

    "thus , there can not exist a 2 - 2 sharing state for @xmath48 .",
    "we conclude by stressing that our werner and isotropic state sharability results allow in fact to put bounds ( though not necessarily tight ones ) on the sharability of an _ arbitrary bipartite qudit state_. it suffices to observe that any bipartite state can be transformed into a werner or isotropic state by the action of the respective twirling map ( either eq .

    "we further determined simple analytical expressions for 1-@xmath3 sharability , namely , that the sum of the bipartite concurrences can not exceed @xmath258 for werner states and can not exceed @xmath291 for isotropic states . in the more general case of @xmath2-@xmath3 sharing , we laid out an algorithmic procedure for calculating the most - entangled @xmath2-@xmath3 sharable werner states using young diagrams . as a corollary of our results , we established upper bounds on the sharability of _ arbitrary _ bipartite qudit states .",
    "several open questions remain for future investigations . the use of the choi isomorphism in translating between 1-@xmath3 joining scenarios and cloning scenarios points to an intriguing connection between the mathematical structures of reduced quantum states and reduced channels . pushing this connection further , we believe it would be fruitful to investigate the analogous problem of _ joining quantum channels _ , making contact , in particular , with recent work on extending quantum operations @xcite .    also related to channels , we would like to continue investigating the effects of different maps on the sharability properties of the input states . in thm .",

    "may be made by narrowing the set of states to be analyzed to other physically relevant families and/or specific joining structures .",
